My personal experience is that those guys worked with Bitcoins well: when regulators closed exchanges and FINCEN pressured around, they helped me recover money that I had expected to have lost forever. I kept my account with them, received a visa card, and had a few exchanges with Jordan and others over there. A sad day.

Don't get in for the money. It's the wrong reason to get in - you'll get scared at the smallest dip and will sellout at a loss if you don't understand the fundamentals of the movement. Ask yourself why you want to invest in it, invest only when you fully understand that answer.
Of course - only invest what you can afford to lose.

regarding step 4 - any currency that can be extended / more printed is going to fail against BTC - the sparsity cap at 21M is what makes it unique. I disagree that governments could just make their own "copy."
It IS possible that they do create it as a limited currency and later on create new batches. But that would be dishonest. However governments being honest...

I think you as an individual can make a strong contribution - however as this subreddit, it is important that we focus: if there are 6 different "get XXX.com to accept bitcoins!" threads, then you're likely to skip them altogether... If you have the drive, then by all mean go ahead, but for right now I feel a steady conversion towards individual sites is better for us - another week, another site, will keep us all focused and will make a spike in their comments data big enough for it to be noticed... instead of a steady trickle.

(buy and sell there - you can check what the market orders are and see the trade history.)
quoting JaredR26 on bitcointalk discussion forum on ASICMINER:


1. AM may have upwards of 200TH/s on order, although this is not confirmed.  They also have agreements in place such that they could order substantially more.
2. AM has in their possession 62 TH/s of AM 10GH/s blades ready to deploy, minus what has been sold so far(0.6TH/s).
3. 13 TH/s is deployed, with 2 more TH/s estimated to be deployed tonight(by tomorrow morning for those of us in America).
4. Of the remaining 48 TH/s, at least 50% will be deployed for AM hashing.  Some undetermined percentage of the remainder will be sold.
5. The company has a philosophy of around 50% reinvestment in the company, and 50% dividend payouts, which means AM likely has a lot more future ahead of it.
6. The order(?) or production of the USB miners has begun, and AM has reserved substantial funds to pay for it and integrated circuits as needed for deployment.
Communicating the plans to shareholders is an issue and still blurry...
If the company pays .007 weekly divs continuously that means 2-3 years to recoup initial cost in divs. However that doesn't even consider the share's value, which might have increased by then.

You forget a few important points:
- While  BFL box goes to next-to-useless worth, ASICMINER maintains or increase the share's worth: it doesn't diminish over time. 
- AM designs and develops their own chips, their value is continuously going up. 
- AM sells hardware and distributes profits. Divs are not linked solely to mining but to their HW sales too.
Investing in BFL is throwing money into a sinkhole, investing in AM is playing russian roulette with amazing odds.

I disagree: it establishes a platform that can easily be used and will not need reorganizing later on: there are many currencies that deal with huge  - if we start to use "Satoshis" then we will see a normalization of the market - ex: "this car is 100M Satoshis"
meanwhile people will struggle a lot if they need to go down smaller and smaller denominations through the decimal granularity. On the other hand, from using Satoshis, the prices are going to shrink and shrink!  
*edit* plus it makes people feel as though they have some type of money: owning 0.02 BTC is not as gratifying as owning 2M Satoshis.

Realistically, Divs are just a bonus. They send them to support the community instead of creating a monster company. I'm sure the price will take a hit when the dividends slow, but the current business model doesn't seem to be heading that way anytime soon. They are throttling their hashrate as-is, and selling hardware to the public so that they can scale their hashing up.... and sending profits out to shareholders after holding enough for next gen chips... This is a sharp company.

You seem to consider the share cost as a loss. Let me remind you it hasn't been so far. In 6 months, you will have 6 Mo* 4 weeks =24 dividends. PLUS the share cost. It's a much better investment than investing your BTCs in BFL and HOPING that you'll receive it in 6 months.

@_date: 2013-04-10 00:07:11
serious manipulation going on. The weird thing is you see the price being driven lower by mini transactions due to wide market spread... and because of the lag suddenly a transaction much bigger will make it through at a price with more variance (ex trading at 130.00 for 0.02... then suenly a 132.00 for 26btc is sold) which makes me wonder WHO gets to make the call on the buying and selling of those orders: do you need a trader's platform to see those orders which aren't market order and decide if you'd like to fill it?

I think it's going to go BEYOND $1,000. So I voted against this statement.

Generation of 2min+ of trading lag following a single order that lowered the price by 10%+ qualifies as manipulation when one can observe a period of PAUSE of 5 minute+ at the low end before being followed by huge buy order to swipe up the people who went into the spread is definitely manipulation in my book.

**1:29pm PST:** Bitcoin trading around $144, down from $150ish in the morning. MtGox = 0 lag. 
**1:30pm PST:** Massive price drop, down to $120 per (big dump of BTC / coordinated)
MtGox saw a 1minute delay in order processing, creating panic/worry (DDoS? Lag from panic?).
**1:39pm PST:** rush back to $140+. Market order. 
**1:44pm PST:** MtGox lag says 2 minutes - Price hovering around $130. Investors that do not look into the why too much are probably freaking out and placing market orders or panicking. **THIS** is what the attacker wants, and that's where they make money. 
**2:22pm PST:** after wild swings between $125 and $132 the market appears to go back towards trading around $137 or so. 
**2:45pm PST:** going $141 and slowly rising
=&gt; Be wary, look at market depth, use market orders when there is trading lag.
The spread is the valley between the volume of *ask* and *sell* order. When it's so wide, it means you're likely playing into someone else's game - in normal times you would see the orders meeting jointly in the middle.

I invested when it sold for around 1.2 BTC a share. I get weekly payments  of around 0.007 BTC per share. Share price remains stable (I'm expecting it to go up soon) and I get free money, all is well.
NB: note that the stock isn't considered a stock, just play money, and you accept the fact you have no legal recourse if the security issuer disapears - but that's common in the bitcoin world, if you want to control your investing, then about the only thing you can do is buy coins and hold them...

it is to "stick it" to the US mostly because the US "stuck them" Quantitative Easing these past two years: Bitcoin can be used as an economic war tool back at the US... 
With the Chinese pushing it so hard, we might want to consider that Bitcoin might have been Chinese manufactured all along... "Satoshi" still holds a million (1/10th) BTCs.

you buy a PT share on btc.co  - currently around 1.29btc per. 
They are the 3rd entity who has produced ASICs but they are not selling them (other two are BFL and Avalon) and instead are selling shares you can buy and get dividends from. It's around 0.007 per share per week right so very good. check the details on the link provided, or go read about them on bitcointalk forums... they have a 200+ page thread where news get posted. - it rocks and is IMO better than an actual ASIC system (as by the time you receive it you might be looking at a recovery over 6 months+, if even...) With those shares, they keep upgrading their setups, so you wouldn't get as much at first but would get a lot more over time.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:10:48
My understanding:
* 1st Bubble: rise from $1 to $33 summer 2011. then back to $3-5 for a year.
* 2nd Bubble: rise from $30 to $250 April 2013. then back to $100-150 for 8 months.

is my favorite exchange - and likely the one dictating the price of shares. If you can buy "ASICMINER-PT" - they are the real value passthrough shares (convertible to real share if desired.) The TAT are 1/100th of those, and you get taxed 5% off the divs on top.

For those unaware, we're in what people refer to as the third currency war - The US vs. China. 
China has a RMBI/Dollar peg where they force the exchange by setting the price - meanwhile the US are trying to get the rate adjusted to rebalance exports/imports. When the US decided to print more Dollars, China had to match that by buying those extra dollars at the same rate. In exchange for setting the strike price, China is able to maintain the cost of its exports very low for the rest of the world.
China is currently suffering from the blow of Quantitative Easing the Fed/USA imposed on the rest of the world in 2010-2011, which essentially exports inflation outwards. If China rallies around a non manipulatable currency, it might disregard the dollar altogether. 
Add to that the fact that China/Russia/India have been trying to get out of the Dollar stranglehold by creating a new monetary currency base, and I will venture that China, not the US, is the one that will help Bitcoin become mainstream.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:18:09
That is *similar* to what I am saying - entities with too much power can and DO try to manipulate the market. There are rules and legislations that prevent that in the real stock market, but nothing of the sort with Bitcoins. I am against those rules and want free trade, but I am for recognizing when manipulation is happening, and this is what this post was about.
I look forward to MtGox upgrading their infrastructures of course - but I would like to recognize such swings in the market especially when they are the products of an entity who I claim did create them intentionally. This is the manipulation I see. I believe once we recognize those attempts, they will start to fail and we will have a more stable currency.

if they deploy too much too fast they will have over 51% of the network - creating uncertainty and working against bitcoin stability: its decentralization. Plus if they get too big, they will advance the tech so fast that they will discourage competition... doing that would weaken bitcoin.
They've therefore partly split from mining groups, started solo mining, and are making sure they remain at a strong yet controlled portion of the network - and to strengthen the network have started selling hardware: it means they make money on the hardware sale, strengthen the distributed nature of the network, meanwhile they are able to deploy more blades and pay dividends comfortably.

You can buy ASICMINER-PT shares on  
That's quick, painless, and you get dividends every wednesday. 
Buying a rig is too much of a gamble - easier to buy into a working mining operation... expected ROI per year is 44% **in BITCOINS** . You might say you're leveraging your bitcoin assets. The shares were at 0.8BTC a month ago, currently trading at 1.2 BTC.
Like all great deals, get into it before too many folks get into it. Every other ASIC company is either too slow or too shady I say.

surprisingly, it does: they realized they couldn't hold all the hashing power for the network's sake and have been holding back - then they decided to sell the hardware to mine to the network with that very intent: they sell the block erupter blades and the USB miners. Investors get divs due to profits. You could start your own mining company, or pour cash into BFL, or you could invest in a way that still balances the network hashing and pays you weekly dividends. (Or you could hold onto your bitcoins, or spend them and forego all those existential issues :)  )

That's because ASICM is a passthrough and pays divs before they are actually confirmed. It is a dangerous practice for the fund I'd say - which itself is sketchy with a big 5% fee on the div. 
You have not received any actual ASICMINER dividend. Although I see a credit in my wallet, it needs to be confirmed by the blockchain - still hasn't.
