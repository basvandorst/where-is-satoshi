Tell me more. Why?

Thanks for the feedback! Would you mind pasting a link to a screenshot?

Oh, good call. It's Yahoo BOSS News API. You gotta pay for it, but at the rate I'm pinging it, it's not more than $5 / month.

I've contacted both to gain access to their API. However, I found a publicly available API for buysellbitco.in. I'm adding 4 other indexes now as well. If I can get done with UI improvements to support all these indexes, you should see them added on Monday the 16th. Cheers!

The markets are on their way back up from the China news. Good to see considering.

So far this has affected Clark Moody's ticker ( as well as BitcoinIndexes ( I'm sure others.
Disclaimer: I run the second one and just fixed it.

Where are they located?

Would love to hear more about this. Who would be interested?

Reddit won't let me post a direct link because it's been posted here before. But check out the live data: 
We're using Mt.Gox's streaming API as well as HTTP polling, and we're barely being able to get relevant data.

All of the indexes' individual API's. My server's polling them periodically and I make an aggregate for the site.

This is the closest we've seen all the prices converge around a single point since we started indexing. It's interesting. But judge with your votes.

Update to my last comment: I have API access to both indexes, and will hopefully have them added Monday. Cheers!
