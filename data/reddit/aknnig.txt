Allow for losing the first two years, most traders even the most successful ones have to go through this losing/training period.

It might be wise to read the rules for the future contracts at OKex (and Bitmex) before making strong statements ;-)

For Litecoin hodlers I think that the Round table agreement was their dream scenario. I have absolutely no doubt that the miners could have "blown" the Litecoin into at least 3 pieces soon after an UASF, just to show what may happen with Bitcoin at an UASF.
Shaolinfry appears to me to be a good developer with excellent technical insights but absolutely no clues about human mind, political understanding nor warfare. 
The Litecoin SW SF "battle" was only a spillover from Bitcoin. It was a battle with very little stakes for the main players, since the real stakes were in Bitcoin. The often used economical incentive arguments play very little roles here. 
Just look at Syria to remind yourself who will suffer most in a substitute war.
Please note that I have no clues about what will happen in a Bitcoin SW SF UASF scenario. But believe me, a Litecoin SW SF UASF had significant risk for going completely wrong since the main players have their real stakes in Bitcoin!

What will happen if the miners perform a simple 51% attack the SegWit chain for a couple of blocks messing up with the transaction history, making this ledger completely useless? So only the ledger of the chain they support has fidelity?
I am wrong here? Can a cryptocurrency with infidel ledger have 32B USD in value?

You seem to carry a logical voice here in this emotional debate. 
A question: Is the following worst case scenario possible? 
Right before a controversial SegWit UASF, miners with support of a few exchanges/nodes... hardfork off a new bitcoin chain. Then perform a simple, few blocks, 51% attack on the activated SegWit chain to mess up a tiny part of the transactions history making this ledger useless for any future balance calculation. So the only "bitcoin" chain with guarantied correct ledger is the chain supported by the miners.
Am I wrong here? An attacked SegWit chain with infidel ledger can no longer be used as a storage of value nor transaction medium and can therefore not support a 32B USD value.

So after a SegWit activation, 51% attack can never happen again? 
But Bitcoin+SegWit will still be a PoW consensus blockchain? Something I don't understand about the Proof-Of-Work concept?
