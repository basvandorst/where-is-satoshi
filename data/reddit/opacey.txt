Oh, I see. Ha ha.
I'm curious what kind of maximum tx throughput a key custodian service like BitGo can currently handle (since they become a transaction bottle neck they would need to invest in fat pipes, data centres etc). Of course a multi signature scheme can have security benefits but centralising the key store then creates a SPOF. In light of the hack but dearth of facts I'm trying to remain objective. I hope more technical info is published soon, for the benefit of everyone. Thanks jedigras.

Hi u/jedigras, Where did you get this stat please? Would be useful for a doc I'm writing, do you have a link?
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:04:21
Thanks for the thoughts. I'm not totally convinced as these traffic spikes are about 30mins apart. As we are transferring 1MB block by 1MB block in serial, about once per second (roughly) I'd have expected a much more rapid switching between bus activity and cpu activity. Rather than saving up a load of block data for a bulk verification.

Thank. So far its taken 24hours, and I'm about half way. Quite surprised its so slow.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:25:19
See images just uploaded in edited original posting. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:03:42
Thanks! I wasn't aware of this. Just tried it with 16834 but sadly doesn't seem to affect things. Will keep an eye and update the thread here.

Do you mean its like the machine takes a big gulp of oxygen (CPU time) and then dives down into the sea (the bus) to transfer as much across as it can before coming up for air again? Seems a bit odd, surely the syncing process on a local machine would be broadly the same as across a WAN?
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:02:04
Sorry, I forgot to mention the first node is omnicored 0.3.0, and the new node is bitcoincored so the folder structure is incompatible. Also I was quite interested to test the ultimate speed limit on transferring the whole blockchain via the protocol so that I can know how far I cn optimise a WAN equivalent.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:05:21
will give it a try and let you know. Tks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:35:23
Finished the sync with dbcache=16384. It didnt speed up from what i can tell. Perhaps I’m throttled by something else. Thanks for the tip either way.

UPDATE: It's been running almost 24 hours now and its only transferred about 85GB of data - just over half way. It is the only processes under load on the machine. This is taking a VERY long time isn't it?. As a reminder I have omnicored as a full node running under one user, and BitcoinCore running under a second user which is connected only to omnicored (.conf file includes "connect=127.0.0.1"). As there is no network between these two peers it should be one of the fastest ways to transfer a blockchain to a node in my estimations. Does this seem like a reasonable transferral (given the handshaking overheads etc)?
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:06:45
Let me know of you still have questions. I’ve been working with Bitcoin for many years.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:05:46
Ah okay, that makes sense, an FX shop is a perfect place to trade BTC! Good luck to you.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:16:26
Could you explain (just generically) what the main business is and how the bitcoin side business emerged?
@_date: 2018-05-31 08:19:05
This is my tweet rant thread about the problems an app like this can cause.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:28:57
This isn’t really the kind of thing that a lot of money can solve, so I would bet that Satoshi will be fine and remain obscure. Theres a prediction market right there.

Check out 
This is a multiparty, multisig version of bitcoin, used to represent ownership of gold stored at the Royal Mints vault. Yes, it requires a level of centralisation, but in return you get outsourced bullion security and digital transfer properties of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:41:31
Seems a sensible plan to me. Bitcoin is still highly volatile in comparison to most national currencies which means...
 - You may kick yourself when it halves and you could have bought double the amount for the same money. Unless there is some fundamental justification for the sell off, don’t give up, keep holding.
 - It may double in value. Don’t panic and sell without considering the CGT tax you have to pay, and also...maybe it will double again next month?
Don’t go into Bitcoin for the short term, go long term and only if you believe Bitcoin has a unique place in the global economy that will make it more and more popular over time.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:24:54
How are you powering it?
Also: It looks a bit dusty right now, how will you filter it?
@_date: 2018-08-27 09:54:30
Ah thanks, I’ve seen something similar on Telegram. I wasnt quite sure what the scam was.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:06:54
What metrics are you after? Is it more CPU, bandwidth etc or blockhain and mempool
If the latter I use the rpc so far, does the job nicely.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:03:01
Japan has gone furthest here i believe designating Bitcoin as currency but have they made it legal tender (as in, may be used to settle any debt?)
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:29:35
Good point. Yes i believe it would be possible... technically.
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:15:49
Okay, I have a similar interest but more so on the chain side of things. Am working on a tool set to help but will take a while. Jameson Lopp customised the bitcoind code to add in monitoring handles (maybe thats what you linked to) for similar purposes. If you haven’t seen that already check his homepage for info.
@_date: 2018-11-06 10:29:33
Its probably not better to download the chain and then validate unless you can only be online for a short time. They will both use the same data and cpu resources / time in the end.
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:59:26
Note that since addresses A and B both have coins doesn’t mean they only have one associated UTXO each, they have at least one each.
Bitcoin transactions consume UTXOs in their entirety, if change is required it must be returned in an output of the transaction.
Just like paper money, it is always spent in its entirety, never ripped in half, and change is returned with other notes.

Good link thank you.

This is a good question, the security track record of the core wallet is hardly ever discussed.
If the wallet is encrypted (make sure it is!) then it is as safe as any other encrypted file on a computer. The wallet file is read into RAM when ever a signing process needs to take place, at this point the private keys are as secure as any other RAM loaded data protected by the host OS.
Core wallet is a hot wallet, therefore the most useful kind of wallet but also more vulnerable to exploits. Does anyone have a history of such exploits occurring?
@_date: 2018-04-26 07:28:44
Yeah it will.

Hi. Seems Ubuntu Mate is out of date and Ubuntu isn't yet packaged up for the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ model. I have switched to Raspbian and am loading that at the moment.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:21:43
I’m a few steps behind you. Can load raspbian but cant load ubuntu mate for some reason, wont boot. In preparation though I have synched a bitcoin core datadir on a desktop using ubuntu. I was planning on copying the whole datadir over to the pi and assumed that would work.
To improve performance i may copy the datadir to the system disc (the SD card) and the datadir/blocks to the external HDD, symlinking it.

How easily can Iranian’s buy bitcoin? Mining might be viable in an oil rich nation but acquiring the hardware at scale is not necessarily possible/permitted. Does anyone have local knowledge of the bitcoin market in Iran?
