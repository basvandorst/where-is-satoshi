December doesn’t have to be a bad month. It may have been in the past, people are going to be putting some selling pressure on the markets in December to get ready for taxes but so long as there are buyers to soak up the sells, December could be great for holders. Also, people are buying Christmas shit instead of cryptocurrencies. I think it all comes down to there not being enough buyers. If crypto were more relevant, people could one day buy BTC for their loved ones. I think we’ll see this one day - might not be for a few years, though. But right now, we know we would need a massive surge of buyers to push price upward. One percent of the coins being sold is big. Pair that with the miners selling their coins and we get a tanking price that would need something huge to pull people - normal, everyday people - into crypto. 
Bitcoin is more of a long-term asset. It will become more valuable as time moves on and one day we will likely see something take place that all but forces people to buy BTC. When that day comes, holders will be very happy. But they shouldn’t sell. By the time BTC gets to the levels we all predict, there won’t be a dollar to sell into. 
I just hope one day we can stop paying the miners to push price down and reward holders, instead. I’d be much happier about holding my bags if the network paid me a few percent to not sell. As long as the supply is inflating, I’m constantly reminded that my holdings are being diluted. And that, my friends, sucks.

After the scammers of the Plus Token Ponzi were arrested, their total BTC acquired from $3,200 to $14k totaled one percent of the BTC supply. These coins are being tornadoed, mixed and sold into an open, down-trending market. 
I expect price to go well below $6k. Google searches are flat, new fiat coming into the space is down and there are no major news events driving new buyers into crypto. Dollar-cost average on the way down if you must - but expect to hold these positions for at LEAST two years. Crypto is on pause. For now. This could take a while. Hang in there, boys ��

Did you kindly advise him to sell that btc at the 61.8 fibonacci level? Did you advise him to sell half his btc everytime it doubles? Did you advise him to have a hodl stack and a risk stack? Holy shit. I sound like an asshole. Not my intentions. I swear. I’m curious. Are they just holding until 54k? 100k? 1,000,000? I wanna know. I wish my parents would have taken my advice to buy SOME btc. Maybe they’ll come around. Way to go with your folks. That must feel fucking greeeaaaat ����������������

Beautiful. I agree with you about not fully exiting. For all we know, we could see another 35% dump after hitting 54-56k then see a pump up to 300k. And who knows after that. When I’m down to 5btc, I’ll only sell half at a time. Never selling everything. Way to go, man. Best of luck to you and your fam ��
