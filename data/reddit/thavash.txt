True.  But looks like ETH is the only one unaffected 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:04:07
$142000 is about the middle. I’d take that. Scary thing is , there was an article on Seeking Alpha in December predicting a price of $142000 in 2018....
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:32:22
Would be funny if every coin recovers except BCH

Oh yeah.  Well it’s fun speculating since actually predicting is impossible as you say 
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:14:19
So infinity in picture 4 ?
@_date: 2019-07-28 16:22:50
1) as long as someone wants to buy you have demand 
2) value went up $100 , because that’s what someone was prepared to pay for it
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:40:09
Anyone think that this will cause a dip  ? Need to buy more
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:05:01
$88,888.........The Japanese will go nuts
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:53:17
If true, this is the MEGATON !!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:34:48
I’m actually reading the book now,about 80% through it. Robert Reich feels that the biggest problems with modern capitalism are lobbying by powerful entities to allow themselves to control markets, and general political corruption. Bitcoin could help because it would reduce the power of Wall Street, who basically have written their own rules for the last 50 years.

When you see DragonBall memes , you know that we’re back on track ...
@_date: 2018-09-11 19:22:55
Just like they do about other things 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:07:46
We need some "Grab" memes and "HODL" memes .......preferably with some Dragonball Z in them
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:36:09
HODL YOU BASTARDS, HODL !!!

Keep this meme to track the upcoming bull run !!
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:09:29
What is the correct route to solving the matter ? 
@_date: 2018-05-27 14:50:40
Doesn’t justify what’s going on right now

I am a South African who lives through this shit daily. Very interesting to hear what the outside world thinks.

No please. The whales would control everything
@_date: 2019-11-07 10:01:07
Start diversification into other things like stocks, just to be safe. Probably best to forget about crypto for months at a time , to clear your head.
@_date: 2019-11-16 08:39:43
The double blow - socialism + fiat
@_date: 2019-11-02 06:54:10
You’ll get about 0.1 BTC for that. When Bitcoin hits $100 000, that will be worth $10k. You decide.
@_date: 2019-11-17 07:31:06
Sell some between $80k-$100k if this run takes us there , and then try to anticipate the next dip to buy under that. Easier said than done
@_date: 2018-10-27 08:51:15
Then it will be stable, more useful , and will see more use cases. 
Then everyone will want some. 
Then it won’t be $6400. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:44:28
Not sure there are many XJ220s for sale nowadays. Perhaps a nice F-type ?

You want an isolated island. In fact , most people should not know where the Citadel is ( until we can build a second one in space ). I vote for Mauritius
@_date: 2019-10-08 10:37:26
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:28:51
Hoo boy , finally something interesting
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:05:16
1) If you buy at 10k, it’s stlll a 10x ROI when it gets to $100k. 
2) There is an opportunity to get it cheaper - not guaranteed but watch this - 
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:43:24
Also , play the ETH/BTC ratio , worth a shot. Can potentially still get into Bitcoin at 1/3 the current price. Watch this video (my equation is at 7:30) - 
@_date: 2019-10-14 17:40:38
Lol imagine if we have a massive spike on the last day of Oct just getting us there
@_date: 2019-10-23 18:06:49
Needs to double in a week. Scary thing is, it did that before ( in 2017 I think)
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:59:04
Well he is tre prophet
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:07:03
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:39:41
I feel bad for those “Oh, it’s going to $3000” people......
@_date: 2019-10-18 05:49:14
Don’t listen to them. You can call them from the citadel and gloat
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:04:13
I didn’t write that. I saw it and posted it here to get arguments against what he’s saying
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:22:26
Lets all remember to sell some in Oct 2020 - whatever the price
@_date: 2019-10-26 05:12:28
If that happens the prophecy is REAL
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:14:07
That’s it. I want more WWF memes this bull run
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:41:06
Sorry to hear but we’re still early , DCA from now and when it hits $100k you’ll be smiling
@_date: 2019-06-22 09:55:58
Nope. Might sell a small portion at $30k but will HODL everything until $1 million
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:05:16
I wanted to know why he’s wrong hence I posted it
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:07:11
Hmm... maybe we can just halve the line , so that one should show $34,5k now?
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:16:14
If you’re right, then any purchase under $15k is good because it’s less than the next bottom.
@_date: 2019-02-24 19:12:26
Hopefully not 
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:02:03
The Bitcoin Saint
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:43:37
The OP is not crazy, he’s referring to this : 
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:51:20
It’s a watch called Outcarb that is current on offer for $0. I was interested but then it’s $20 shipping , I can buy BTC for $20........
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:02:20
So HODL until 1 million
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:35:08
.....aaand we’ve just hit $11k
@_date: 2019-06-05 11:28:39
Doesn’t showcase the brainpower that the real Satoshi would have
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:31:49
That’s also why I posted the price most people missed it
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:58:50
Well if you HODL and Bitcoin does reach a million, that’s $100k.....
@_date: 2019-06-30 11:09:21
Don’t ever mention again that you have so many bitcoins. Try putting the hard drive in another laptop
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:42:07
�� we could see $20k sooner than you think
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:07:03
One positive - they probably spent time and lots of money creating that crap 
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:11:42
They just had an election how are they “moving towards dictatorship”. ?
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:51:34
Let me guess ..... he likes gold and some stock right ?
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:09:06
It’s probably never going back to $3k.
Never say never .........but yeah
@_date: 2019-06-12 08:52:10
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:26:07
You may be on to something here ....��
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:17:49
Shouldnt euro Vegeta have a moustache?
@_date: 2019-06-23 05:01:35
Of course.
@_date: 2019-06-15 06:09:28
Then who’s Charlie Munger? Launchpad ?
@_date: 2019-06-23 05:01:11
Sikhs , Buddhists , Jains and Parsis all seem to be living happily in India. There isn’t any “violent repression” there. I wonder why.
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:13:51
Some them them are accepting it to accumulate
@_date: 2019-06-08 07:23:31
Should I set an order for $6500?
@_date: 2019-06-24 18:54:31
Not even then - some are already lost permanently
@_date: 2019-06-03 11:47:51
Oh yes
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:21:56
Remember everyone saying that it would still drop further to $2k? Nobody really knew
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:35:02
So you guys use D-Wave computers ?
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:02:32
Buy the other half back at 10k. You’ll have more. 
HODL the rest
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:33:36
9. Not your keys, not your coins
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:52:08
What you’re seeing is a combination of some real events , fake news and the Abrahamic victim card being played. As I said, the other ( non-abrahamic ) groups don’t seem to be complaining , because they don’t go around trying to interfere and convert.
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:09:40
DCA Bitcoin , and also buy some ETH , and if the ETC/BTC ratio improves you can swop it out for BTC when that happens. 
See : 
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:04:16
The biggest questions are : 
1) What’s the new peak?
2) What’s the new “higher low” ?
Anyone who can predict this will get massively rich short term
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:17:20
There is a point where that will stop though
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:33:51
You and me, we’re WANTING a mini-crash
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:19:54
The most impressive prediction was the bottom.  
More worried about that $87 call though
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:10:07
Use a hardware wallet. The profit will keep increasing 
@_date: 2019-06-18 06:02:01
Yes , at $100k Bitcoin , 0.03 is $3k
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:41:39
Bought at 8k but wouldn’t mind if it goes below that. Remember, “buy the drop”. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 14:37:04
Deflation 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:29:42
Stay calm. Think about an amount you have that you’re prepared to lose. Register on an exchange.........BUY
@_date: 2019-06-13 10:54:46
This is it....
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:02:02
Are you still here ? Let’s say I believe you and I’m taking your advice ~ basically it’s 
1) Invest in the currencies mentioned 
2) Move to citadels 
My question is what else ? What else can someone do to prepare ?
@_date: 2019-02-23 17:29:17
Yeah the ETC 51% attack isn’t a “hack” 
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:29:59
I could. I would definitely rather be wrong and not remembered and BTC is $100k in Nov 2020 though.....
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:37:19
Well , buy what you can now and if it reaches $100k you will still have done well. 
Also watch this : 
@_date: 2019-12-04 03:43:23
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:23:22
It is NOT too late. In fact this is a good time 
@_date: 2019-04-28 16:32:36
Curve looks like where we are right now
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:48:46
Guys , we will have 5G. 300GB won’t seem as big
@_date: 2018-11-12 15:51:45
We start again and re-mine them all !!
@_date: 2018-11-18 09:24:56
At $150 , you just need to invest $3150 to buy 21 BTC, and then own 1 millionth of all BTC. This is what I’ll do immediately if that price happens 
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:25:51
Wait his surname was actually HODLER ?
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:54:21
Oh I know what to do , I’m asking when to do it 
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:14:35
It costs $10000 to send 1 cent ?!!!!!
(I know, I know.....)
@_date: 2018-11-19 10:55:38
True. It feels weird that I’m excited about the current state while everyone is panicking. Wish I had more cash on hand 
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:17:30
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:38:58
Will slowly crawl back to the $20k ATH over the next few months. From there positive sentiment could push to $30k , negative sentiment could cause another crash to $15k
@_date: 2019-01-06 08:53:38
Exactly. When he opens his mouth , he proves he’s not Satoshi
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:16:47
Hey Ricardo. How you doing ? We worked together at iSolve many years ago, I also worked with your dad 
@_date: 2019-01-21 04:47:14
Now I’ve got that Beatles song in my head.......if this guy is correct I’ll make that my anthem. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:37:32
The real Satoshi who created Bitcoin would never threaten to dump it - here’s your proof right here 
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:19:25
Keep calm. Don’t panic. It will probably go back up to that level if fundamentals are accurate ( and hopefully more ). You need to play the waiting game now. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:19:01
Where is this? ( also in jhb )
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:18:40
Nothing he has written or said since has sounded as intelligent as the original white paper. That alone is your proof
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:36:51
Frys Renton was the same 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:16:41
What we really need is Bitcoin Grandpa 
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:23:47
Let’s hope ��
@_date: 2019-09-14 07:36:42
The Poms will flock to Bitcoin as a safe haven
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:26:59
Even if it takes a year to recover... will we ever see $10k again after the recovery?  If not, then good time to keep buying. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:08:19
The reason Bitcoin isn’t surging is because we haven’t seen more Dragonball memes. Dragonball brings good luck
@_date: 2018-04-14 10:53:30
Buy the dip !!
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:53:17
Oh please happen....
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:01:43
I actually hope that you’re right ,  I regret not buying more at $3500. But sadly I also think this thing has legs now, and is only headed one way
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:52:46
Wrong. If your balance is 2,5 BTC , your gain is still 150% , because who gives a crap about fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:47:54
There’s a site called dickline.info?
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:04:45
2020- we could conservatively hit $75k. 
2025? $200k
@_date: 2018-12-23 10:30:09
Hi. I have an older Pi that I’m not using. Can I convert  into a node ( and is there a tutorial )?
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:30:55
Someone insisted it was going to 2k. I bought at 4K but should have bought more
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:43:36
Vegeta is our good luck charm
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:05:23
He’s right you know ....
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:02:18
If a percentage of cellphone users are running nodes on their phones , what will the impact be to network resiliency? Could be massive
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:45:12
Hope you’re right I have some buy orders from $6k-$6,5k and then happy if the bull run starts
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:02:59
Patience - they don’t know what’s about to hit them 
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:42:40
Whoa oh! Living on a prayer........
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:20:43
Thanks. It’s a “2”
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:19:45
Definitely still there. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 06:27:29
This is similar to what Vitalik said at last years highs 
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:08:17
Wow , that Tsar bomb...... how far away was that cloud visible from ?
@_date: 2018-12-01 08:40:58
Buy the dip ...
@_date: 2018-12-29 18:22:36
Yeah defrag, and BCHSV is the bad sector
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:14:16
Yup. I use 2 from my country
