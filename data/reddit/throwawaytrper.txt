What?? How can it be free? 
My BtC are in a blockchain .info wallet. Can you advise on how I could do it with minimal fees?

No ethereum?

Can i transfer my btc from non-segwit blockchain.info to the segwit Ledger nano with no problems?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:20:11
Thanks. How much wait time do you predict for a significant enough reduction in the fees?

Is there an easy to follow paper wallet making tutorial? Also paper vs ledger nano s wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:21:30
On blockchain. info

How's the Ledger nano s? Is there any cheaper alternatives. From what i understand the ledger device is more secure than a paper wallet because nobody gets to see my private keys, not even me.

I meant transferring my BCH to an exchange would not jeopardize my BTC holding in a new wallet. I know it doesn't make sense, but I wanted a quick confirmation from folks here. 
But yes, you're absolutely right, I'll think about the best time to do the exchange.

Thanks so much. Just the info I needed.

I dont know if you know about blockchain.info. So years ago I sent BTC there and left it. Apparatnly it sat on an "imported address" there and I never bothered to transfer it the the actual wallet private key given to me by blockchain.info. 
I later transferred BTC to blockchain.info (internally), and then out to a hardware wallet. 
Now my BCH is still in the imported key, but I don't have access to it within the bitcoin cash section. I tried to send a little bit BCH out and it is stuck on pending and says that I'm sending it out from = {{ fromIndex() !== false ? accounts[fromIndex()].label : toBitcoin
I have no idea what that means. Is that little BCH now lost?
EDIT: i didnt make a mistake. I sent it to an exchange's BCH wallet.
