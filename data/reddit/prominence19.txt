A rule of thumb is: KISS
KISS is an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid" 
"The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. "
This is especially the case for Bitcoin to become successful. For me successful would mean that a lot of people know what it is and use it. Our decisions can have a great impact so it's important to keep it as simple as possible.

Free publicity. Seeing millions of dollars worth of bitcoins in any form of news gets interest from people.

@_date: 2014-04-24 19:28:42
Not 100% confirmed but seems likely:
On page 4/11 they want to make money by committing arbitrage:






Even if this is fake. They could definitely have made a lot of money by disabling withdrawals which made the prices drop to 150 USD or less on gox. They would have the ability to withdraw coins and sell them on exchanges which might be the reason for the huge dumps during that period. They could basically buy customer's coins which are stuck in the exchange and sell those for triple on other exchanges.
I'm not even sure if that is illegal at all, just a huge dick move.

You have a valid point, the blockchain would show that if they didn't use a coin mixer. That is assuming that Gox didn't take the liberty of transferring those coins out long before halting withdrawals. 
Funds aren't exactly tied to an account so they could certainly anticipate for this and create fake accounts to then cash out coins not belonging to them without issue. The proof could be in leaked Gox files.

Unless you consider 2-3% to be 'hyperinflation'
A bit of panic is all that's needed. 


Alchemy isn't the right word. New metameterials have many of the positive properties of gold. The value will be pure emotional at some point. 


It can be spent digitally, but transaction fees are pretty steep (Western Union) and there are limits on how much you can send etc..
Bitcoin isn't accepted everywhere, but the rate of companies accepting BTC as payment is steadily increasing. 


Because of all the media attention and people new to crypto are likely to only know Bitcoin. 
Other coins like DarkCoin are good contenders, but there aren't many altcoins with the publicity of BTC.
$1 million seems like a big number, but for a total of 21million coins worldwide that's a marketcap of 21 Trillion. Reasonable if it's widely used accompanied with the decline of the dollar's worth. This won't happen over night though.

I think it's important for the security of the wallet. Apparently the devs both have to work full time to support themselves now and spend evenings and weekends supporting MultiBit. The option to opt out should be there though. Otherwise it's possible to track what wallet software one uses (in case it's important to not have that known).

The trick to be untraceable is to trade it for many altcoins on many exchanges and then back to bitcoin. It's child's play to remain anonymous doing that. If that's not safe enough, you could also just rent hashing power and mine any coin you desire.

Those are valid points but many people would disagree on the credibility of the US dollar. The current way of borrowing money to pay back debt will fall flat on it's face at some point. When that happens, you'll have an inflationary currency. Nobody would want to use dollars at that point. Your entire reasoning is that the U.S. is financially sound. That's not the case. The world isn't going to trust the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency because: Why would anyone use an *inflationary currency*?

Every few weeks it becomes more difficult to mine Bitcoin. This is due to the increasing amount of miners every time. Once this happens, it takes more hashing power to mine one bitcoin. Miners will experience higher costs and have to sell at a higher price not to make a loss. The price on BTC-E was just below 630USD because there was literally a wall. Someone put up a large sell order of 200BTC so it was like a glass ceiling stopping the price from rising further. Once that wall gets broken, the rate of buy orders might increase and we could reach 700 in a day.

Proof of Stake basically means that you mine bitcoins by holding them in your wallet for a set period of time. For Mintcoin that's 20 days. 
The first year you get 20% of your bitcoins added due to PoS.
This means mining will use a lot less electricity. It'll be hard to implement this though and people are sure to get on the wrong fork and then get put off on using bitcoin. 
If you want PoS I'd say to start using a coin like Mintcoin or Blackcoin. PoS is the only way to mine new coins for those.

You could either:
1. Stick to the current system.
2. Sort Upvotes/Downvotes by karma from active members.
Determining if a user is active and less likely to be a bot could be done in several ways. However seeing bots make bullshit posts to fake activity would make the place a lot worse. 
My idea would be to add a karma limit to upvotes/downvotes. That way you only see upvotes/downvotes from people with a certain amount of positive karma. It could be set for an entire subreddit or manually by a user.

I think the smallest unit of a BTC, a Satoshi is still good enough. Once BTC becomes worth more, people will start paying with smaller amounts of BTC. Bits could catch on, but it's still too ambiguous. 
I'd rather vote to not change anything since Satoshi is well known enough and not ambiguous. Besides that, we shouldn't forget who made BTC what it is today.

Yes, everything is pointless if you really think about it. Just wanted to let people know that there might be a reason for faucets giving away money. This site however isn't actually scamming. The recaptcha format isn't usually static like this. If it were too hard, you could click it to get a different one, but this site directly feeds the image from google. Not sure what the dev was thinking. They might even just forward the recaptcha so who knows.

Altcoins are the guinea pigs. Have you even realize how many altcoins died for ~~your sins?~~ the few with innovative features? There are lots of direct copies out there and the ones that innovate or have a huge community behind them are the ones that survive. Bitcoin is in my opinion more secure at this point. Mainly due to the hash power behind it and the publicity. Rocking the ship at this point will have adverse effects.

Careful with filling in captcha's for faucets. There are people who are running faucets to solve captcha's.

It could work like this: For your email address there'll be a wallet generated. This online wallet forwards every payment from it to any address(es) that you choose. If there isn't an address, it'll stay in that wallet until it's redeemed. To edit payment info, you will need to confirm the payment via email. An optional secure password would be a good idea so hacking someone's email won't enable you to change the addresses. 
Account recovery could be done by requiring the owner of the payment address to send an exact amount like 0.0013432 BTC to a certain address. This amount will be returned excluding any fees.
