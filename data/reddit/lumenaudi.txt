So by using 1 broad metric - “tether purchasing power”  - and the fact that bitcoin price went up or down over certain periods of time, this is sufficient evidence to conclude no causation? 
The paper posted is far more in depth than this analysis could ever refute. Perhaps you are refuting one point??
I would argue that there is more to the data than what you did here - simply looking at the total supply of USDT, and then creating a standard metric to track the incredibly uncertain demand/supply of bitcoin. What about USDT creation timing, USDT trading volume, bitcoin trading volume?

Unless you have a job that requires FINRA certification (series 6/7) or one that deals with financial securities, they likely will not contact your employer.
However, the fact that you are worried about this probably means you should communicate your concerns to someone more knowledgeable about your specific situation.

Short explanation: leverage.
Long explanation: Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the former economic advisor for the Reagan administration, has written extensively about this subject.
In his view, some of the biggest banks in the world have been working to suppress the price of gold in Western markets for many years. They accomplish this through creating so-called “naked shorts” out of thin air.
A naked short is simply a contract that allows an institution to place a sell order for a particular asset without having any ownership of the asset.
Conclusion: CME and CBOE contracts are paper contracts, that don’t require true ownership of bitcoin. Therefore, shorting bitcoin doesn’t require the market stimulus of buying it on an exchange (aka buying with a premium, and buying from someone who usually has to reinvest some portion of USD in the actual market for a ‘better’ price than you would get, usually by OTC).

Currency in the Digital Age: The Intersection of Bitcoin, Blockchain Technology, and Banking
It’s a high school project - aka consumption and regurgitation of knowledge that already exists. You aren’t a grad student, no one is expecting a breakthrough thesis.
Like others said, watch documentaries/read books and you’ll develop an angle. Focus on what it WAS and IS, not what you think it WILL BE.

So true! But when you look at it from the perspective that USD is the gas the makes the market go up and down, it makes sense.
 2% of usd wants to use leverage to make it go up but 98% of usd wants to use equivalent leverage to push it down... what happens and who wins?
And no, I don’t mean 100% of all usd is in bitcoin...just an example

Imagine Alice owns all 100 BlockTokens. Start price $20 each.
Sells to 90 people at $20.
Alice now has 10 tokens and $1800, 90 people have 1 token.
Alice tanks the price with the remaining 10 tokens, sells from $20 down to $4, average price $10. Gets another $100. 
Price is now $4. Alice has $1900 and 0 tokens.
50 people sell for $4. Alice buys all for $200.
40 people sell at $8. Alice buys all for $320.
10 people sell at $20. Alice buys all for $200.
Alice now has complete control with all 100 tokens back. She raised $1900, but only spent $720... surplus of $1180, and back to square 1 where she still owns all the tokens.
Alice spends that $1180 creating newer tech, attracting new customers, and these guys want to buy her tokens at $40 now...process starts all over again...
In reality, these “Alice’s” are created by default when users choose to send their bitcoin to a large centralized exchange. Wouldn’t you also do what’s profitable for yourself as a large entity/market maker? Coinbase, binance, bitfinex, you give them your fiat for bitcoin, and then you give them your bitcoin for a digital representation of value via shitcoins. Of course they will strangle you out of the market at $4....
Result of FOMO, selling at a loss for disposable income, and a technological idea that always sells to desperate speculators. Remember that every up needs a down, HODL!

Yeah Stripe invested millions in stellar for this purpose. I don’t remember the name of the specific application, but they made it really easy for merchants to use. Maybe it’s apay.io? maybe coinsquare? Not sure.
Using an anchor on the stellar network allows you to enjoy the features of fast infrastructure, but the liquidity and ability to convert to BTC at any time of your choosing

Famous last words. 
Crypto is only “real” when you, and only you, control the private key and can check a block explorer with the public key to confirm balance. 
Otherwise you simply own a number in someone’s database, maybe or maybe not having a relation to a private/public key. 
Stay safe friends

FDR wasn’t the only one...or even the first.
Marco Polo documented one of the first widespread occurrences of ‘paper money’ in 13th century Mongolia.
The Great Khan lead a massive trading empire, conquering swathes of land and resources and people. His advisors soon encouraged the printing of notes made from Mulberry bark, stamped by government authorities for authenticity. These notes were ‘backed’ by hoards of confiscated gold from his own people.
Not only did he collect gold from his own people (with Khan paying a 3%+ premium over spot, what a deal!), traders from India and Europe soon brought bags of gold with them to exchange for Khan Notes. These foreign traders could then use these paper notes on the long trek home, anywhere within the massive empire, without carrying heavy bags of gold.
Khan threatened death for anyone not willing to use his paper notes. His enforcement killed those caught using physical gold as a medium of exchange. Khan sought to capture all physical gold.
Eventually, counterfeiting and inflation undermined faith in Khan’s notes. Within several years, the face value of notes represented less than 10% of the mass in gold that they were supposed to. Physical gold and silver again became sought after. Stagflation and economic woes soon plagued the empire.
Sound familiar?

The best time is actually Wednesday nights, empirically. 
Wait for the quick dump, load the cannons, let’s roll.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:33:59
I’m not exactly sure why, that’s just what the numbers say. Albeit, lots of different data will tell you different thingsz
Perhaps it has to do with how many users are online - aka reading news and actively trading.
Time of day matters as well. During the run of 17-18 quick pumps were very common around primetime (6pm) in the United States. Dumps would happen commonly at like 3am. 
For some reason I would predict large market makers take advantage of this activity discretion- high price on the weekends when people typically buy bitcoin and trade, dips on Wednesday to take accumulated limit buy orders, before anyone else can pile on the dump.

Thank you. Instead of selling for $1.59 they’ll probably just opt to take the route of other centralized exchanges 
- getting users funds ‘hacked’
- closing their exchange at certain times as to not allow profitable tether trades
- delisting coins/withdrawals with like a one week email notice
- locking accounts with endless support tickets that go nowhere

In the age of internet communication, how can we as humans accept and allow such subjective suffering? Can someone please tell me how I can help or point me in the direction of any actions others have taken to help these people? Can’t we organize some that allows our fellow world citizens of Venezuela to:
1) provide necessities for themselves temporarily due to donation
2) become temporarily disentangled from the inevitably plummeting currency that is bolivars due to stabilization of price of bitcoin compared to bolivars
3) perhaps become a permanent, participating members of this new, broader human-cryptocurrency conception of money

Except the fact that ‘moon kids’ and ‘fomo investors’ provide the fuel for exactly what everyone here likes...irrational price increases. But please, tell me how you never look at the price of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin user-base growth and price increases are statistically correlated. What this means is that as the price increases, typically more new users join the btc club.....Hmmm more users of bitcoin, what a terrible thing right?
Realize that you are complaining about the idiots who dumped all their money into bitcoin at the peak and lost everything to previous holders, who oftentimes are the contributors to the continued development of bitcoin. 
You should be able to handle some stupid comments if it means someone essentially took 1000’s of dollars in losses to put them there.

Hmmm...to preface this, I hate tether and moreover any irresponsible management of fractional reserve assets.
But nah, tether becoming insolvent won’t help bitcoin’s price increase. You must have missed the peer-reviewed academic research by John Griffin out of University of Texas Austin.
For those who want to read actual facts, based on mathematics:
For those who want the abstract: Tether transactions were statistically associated with the manipulation of bitcoin price all the way from 3k to 20k.

Yes and no. Timing with bull cycles and bear cycles in Bitcoin are important to the logarithmic price increases seen in the past (acceleration of accumulation), but less disposable income makes it difficult to raise money at all.
When bitcoin increases and peaks in price (bull cycle), the user base of bitcoin also grows in a logarithmic fashion. This allows large holders of Bitcoin to typically ‘sellout’ a portion of their holdings.
Once the ‘new money’ has been collected by the (formerly) large bitcoin holders at 19k, these same large holders can suppress the market price and ‘force’ those who purchased high to sell  low. The large holders still control the orderbook, and now the USD that was given to them by new holders...
A US recession causes small holders to sell bitcoin for disposable income. In this case, the bitcoin market price would still suppressed from the last bull cycle and that’s accumulation would accelerate. 
What I’m saying is that a US recession will likely cause a liquidation of bitcoin by small holders, accelerating accumulation by large holders. Hypothetically, if all these small accounts liquidate and the same large market makers remain, the cycle starts over with more money than before...

I agree that it would be unwise to automatically exclude banks from any responsibility, perhaps that’s partially the case. 
USDT is has long been one of the largest stablecoins, and Bitfinex has long held a dominant position in the bitcoin game.

Here’s a theory -
The issue is that the value of bitfinex’s bitcoin holdings are actually used to back tether, not just cash. “Short term liquidity” they call it.
With the fud, the crowd is exiting tether for bitcoin, meaning bitfinex is in a short squeeze. They need the price of bitcoin to increase momentarily as people exit (so they can dish out small amount of bitcoin for $1 tether. After this public exodus, the bitcoin price crashes and bitfinex attempts to purchase (slightly larger amounts of) bitcoin with that same $1 tether. Whether or not they recoup an equivalent amount of bitcoin depends on the market and volume.
Sounds like other stable coins realize that bitfinex is about to drop the hammer, and will only accept large amounts of bitcoin in anticipation of the price drop. Thus why their value is at a premium $1.02-$1.05
