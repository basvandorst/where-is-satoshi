I like campbx.  I can't say that I have used any of the others but they seem pretty good.  I do like how over the past few days they have finally updated their depth table to refresh automatically, it was annoying to have to hit refresh all the time before.

I have been using them for about a month now, and they seem to be pretty good.  I do think that the new table is much nicer as well, and it saves me the trouble of hitting the refresh button all the time.

I like them but I still think that they need to grow quite a bit.  They will have bid-ask spreads up to a few dollars sometimes, and I do not think they have very much volume, but if we keep getting more people to join than we will be able to solve that problem.

I like them. I have only been with them for a short time, so my thoughts on the matter probably do not count for much.  They do seem to have a light trade volume to me, and their bid to ask spread seems to be a little bit large at times.  I typically see it from $1-$4.
