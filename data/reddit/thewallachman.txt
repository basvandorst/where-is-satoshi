even if you had 10 million in doge you could only buy about 3 bitcoins with that.

I think we can all agree most bitcoin marketplaces are shit. This is why I have high hopes for OpenBazaar.

Yotube is going through a cringe binge with these bitcoin videos.

They will soon begin to accept bitcoin, just a matter of time at this point.

You better be careful, those bitcoins are probably in Columbia right now.

How did you come up with the name OpenBazaar? I know there were a lot of people saying that darkmarket should be renamed to freemarket. Secondly, Will I be able to sell services on OpenBazaar like hacking services and such? Thirdly, Once you guys get everything squared away and have a functional decentralized market place I figured I would contact a friend who goes by the name of gramsadmin and ask him to put you guys up on his markets page on the dark net search engine grams. Cheers!

Well, we can pretty much blame Max Keiser for getting this guy to accept bitcoin.

Fantastic article.

Max Keiser won't be happy with this news.
