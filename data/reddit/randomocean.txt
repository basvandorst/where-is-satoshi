I agree - I would guess that the lack of support for funded nodes might just be because the original design did not anticipate wallets that were not full nodes.   But given your question and the current state of bitcoin, is there a way we could support full node operators without changing the underlying algorithm?

wouldn't my node abandon the confirmation attack when the majority chain became longer than mine?

would anyone notice that I was using a special fork?

I hope that a lone individual or even a special interest group couldn't cause bitcoin to destabilize

Dear Sirs -
I am reaching out to you today in the most sincere respectful request for assistance.  Your reputation as respectable and honest citizens has affirmed my desire to seek your help on a sensitive matter.  I am a bitcoin prince who has many bitcoins in the sum of 5 millions of dollars in an account on coinbase.  Unfortunately it has come to pass that coinbase cannot afford their network access and I have been denied access to my bitcoins.   Cloudflare has assured me that they can restore access to the bitcoins for 30,000 dollars.   If you would be so kind as to assist me by sending bitcoin to me in the sum of 300000 dollars, I will ensure that I can access the coin base and I will split the 5 millions of bitcoins with you
With greatest respect
- Satire only, don't send me bitcoins!
