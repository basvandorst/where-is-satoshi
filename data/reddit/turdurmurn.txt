I'm not sure if they are open to the public, but they indicate some kind of trading is going on and the prices look right.

Paypal / Ebay investors are facing serious competition as a payment provider.  Innovation from Square, and to a lesser degree Bitpay and Coinbase, will quickly date their current offering.  Yes, I suspect that's the white flag waving and we can expect integration of bitcoin as a payment option when you visit a site that uses paypal.

One attack vector that people don't often mention is the retailers and their employees or contractors.  For people making transactions in bitcoin, it will be possible for someone to look at your transaction and see the balance of the sending wallet.  If you re-use passwords and they have your address then you are only one stolen phone or laptop from losing your bitcoins.
Food for thought.

What is the format of the digital download?  It doesn't say on the website.

The interviewer nicely cut through the vague speech and asked directly about bitcoin, and the CEO didn't bother to side-step it.  It's bitcoin, even paypal / ebay cannot be so stupid to think anything else is the best current option.  They have to compete with Bitpay and Coinbase and Square et al... if they don't include bitcoin payments soon they are losing a slice of profit for no defensible reason.
