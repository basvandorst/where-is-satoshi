This is truth.
I mean it's one thing if you can't pay to keep the lights on, or get enough food, but once you get past the basics, then what you said.  It's all about the things you do and not about the number of digits in your bank balance.

4 BTC.  Which may not be a lot to you guys, but it's a lot to me.

There's some truth to this, but as a MtGox victim I'm not sure I'd call the weird limbo that I'm in a blessing.

That was my thought too.   It seemed really transparent to me as well - all the references to the startup and his bosses.  I'm sure this was all a drunken mistake...  and not at all a clever advertising campaign.

There were wallets and there were exchanges, but MtGox was the largest of them all.  And people's wallets on their home computers were hacked occassionally too.  At that time I was mining alt-coins and I would take the mining proceeds, convert to BTC, move to MtGox, sell, and then do an ACH to my US bank account.   I had a scheme of selling 30% and keeping 70% and I kept my BTC on my home computer - and still have most of them.  But I used MtGox to cash out.  There were other exchanges, but lots of them had been hacked - it was a weird time - and MtGox seemed as good as any other and being the largest exchange it seemed safer than most.
In the end, I lost 3.1 BTC - which was what was in transit at the time.   And if that seems like an insane amount of money, my recollection at the time was that it was worth about $1200 or so.  My claim was accepted, I'm on the list, I paid my $100 to join "MtGox Legal" and I hope Civil Rehabilitation happens.
I thought this thread was pretty interesting though.

Hey, Mark, I don't know if you'll read this or if it will be buried in the vast pile of messages, but I wanted to say that I am a creditor, my claim was accepted and I'm on the list, joined "MtGox Legal" and paid my $100.  
I just wanted to say thanks for the AMA.  I was briefly really angry with you years ago.  This AMA helped me understand things a bit better.  For what it's worth, I forgive you and I'm not upset with you any more both due to time passing but also reading about you and also reading these responses in this AMA.  Best of success on all of this.  I hope CR happens as soon as possible.

Definitely this.  Of course some hate-subreddit is going to find a reason why it's not deserved.  That's what they do... because they that's why the whole subreddit exists.
I think it's a well deserved award and I'm a bit dismayed that the second-from-the-top comment is that it's a conspiracy theory that The Economist has a vested interest.  
The Economist is a magazine that is about economics, why on earth wouldn't they get exited about a major innovation in the field of economics?
