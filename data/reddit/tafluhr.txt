So $7,000,000,000 was just created out of thin air? I don't really understand the situation

When bitcoin was created it had no value per coin. Then that value was established and has grown to what it is today through markets. BCH was created today and no value was lost from bitcoin but all of a sudden this new coin was worth $350 each. That is not the same thing.

Couldn't agree more about the weak hands leaving. If you're going to get spooked by a horrible conflicted opinion from a man who would love to see bitcoin fail, then this is not for you.  Dips will happen, that's life.

Gotta have moments like today to get to where we want this to go. Thanks for the cheap coins weaklings!

Ah the ole buy high sell low. Brought to you by @_date: 2017-05-27 02:48:21
Cheap compared to where this ship is going. Adoption is going to continue to explode this year. Segwit will be a game changer. Lots of reasons to be bullish for bitcoin.

This guy didn't know wtf he was doing and got worked. Probably wasn't even bitcoin.

After the dip yesterday I wasn't sure what would happen. People are buying dips so strong that it rebounds. We are in new territory and people are trying to relate it to the Gox bubble, or stocks. The truth is, no one knows. Its spreading like wildfire and there just aren't enough coins to go around.
