So the only currencies worse than bitcoin are Latvian and Ukrainian? So a coutry partial occupied by Russia and one that could be occupied by Russia are the only two countries fiat which are underperforming compared to bitcoin? We should convince the Russians to stop hold bitcoin then.

You're right. I double checked and it's the Venezuelan Bolivar. My point still stands most of the "troubled currencies" in the linked charts are clearly doing better than BTC.

I'm pretty sure he's a bitcoin core dev.

Just leave him alone. Let him believe he's right.

Honestly, your more likely to get esports fan to make their bets in virtual hats than bitcoin. In fact, there's a number sites that already provide that service.

Not anymore. They all charge fees now because they're all running out ActualMoney^tm

For money.

That last paragraph was just referring to their upcoming schedule. The article was about Nascar on FOX which didn't include any Truck races that year.

If you're rich? You wouldn't. You'd pay someone else to drive you around.

If someone were to ask him about sponsor of the truck he owns. It's doubtful he will be very involved at all with this sponsor, since he has bigger obligations to promote the sponsors of the Sprint Cup car he drives. Probably the only time we'll hear about Bitpay is during a truck race that few will see.

The article is referring to ratings for periods *before* Fox Sports 1/2 existed (when the truck series was still on Speed and that channel still existed.) The last paragraph (which is the only one mentioning CWTS) is only refering to upcoming changes, as of the date of the article. Those number are specifically referring to viewship on Sprint Cup races. This does not include the 2014 season since the article was originally posted in 2013 (yes, I know what the date says but that's the last update, not the original date.)

This is the Truck series though, the third of 3 major NASCAR series. Much smaller numbers involved then either the Sprint Cup or Xfinity Series. It's even worse at events that aren't shared with the other 2 series.

You're right. NASCAR was still using carburators this century and I can still remember all the complaining about a switch to electronic fuel injection which also added ECUs to the cars.

Everything was going so well until this point.

That's not the series Bitpay is sponsoring a vehicle in.

I wouldn't exactly call fans of a truck racing series mainstream users. Basically, of the three NASCAR racing series, this is the one that no one watches. It's pretty sad when an altcoin community has better marketing than an actual bitcoin business.
