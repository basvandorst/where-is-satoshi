I guess helping to destroy America is "winning"?  And all of these investigations are made up "Fake News", right?
Get a grip.  is a cesspool.

Lmao what an asinine statement.  Have fun with your personal reality.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:30:14
We're just going to ignore your first post then?  Such a victim.

Low energy.  Sad.

Translates to "anyone who doesn't invest in BCH is not sensible"--aka "you're all stupid".  But nah, that's not an insult.  That's a very nice thing to say!


Ouch.  My feelings.  Can you get me some winning lotto tickets since you can see the future?  I'm sorry you have to attach your personal self worth to some random crypto.  You gonna claim you're a better person because your football team won a game too?  Let's not point out that BTC is 5x the value of BCH (because that wouldn't fit your narrative) but maybe when you're older you'll understand how markets work...maybe people too.

Now that you have no argument, you call me a loser.
Good job!

There are so many things wrong with that statement...
* GDP change this early into a presidency can mostly be attributed to the previous administration.  It's always been this way.  The GDP doesn't magically change the second someone takes office.
* You can only measure illegal border crossings if they are actually caught/stopped so your statistic is impractical for measuring what you're trying to convey.  There are still the illegals that come over undetected.  Also, lol at you concerned about illegal border crossings.  If that's what you consider a major "threat", you maybe need to open your eyes a bit.  Statistically, illegals aren't a concern.
* You're gonna tell me that a military campaign that has been in progress for years, with multiple countries involved, can 100% be credited to the new president of the United States (who has 0 military experience other than dodging the draft)?
What bubble do you live in?  In what culture is such ignorance allowed to be cultivated?  Do you realize how manipulated/brainwashed you are?  At BEST you're horribly misinformed/ignorant.  FOX and are echo chambers designed to keep you in this feedback loop...but who am I kidding?  You're not going to listen to me :)

Was just pointing out that your statements on BTC/BCH were on par with the retard-speak that comes out of I'm not advocating for whatever "team" I'm on, I'm trying to highlight how utterly stupid that political/mental spectrum is.  There's a difference :)
I knew where you came from before I even checked your history (which is why I checked it).
I'm not telling you to invest in BTC, I'm inviting you to think a little more critically while not being a low energy fuckboi.  Is that the language you like, daddy?  You're getting cucked!  It's for your own best interest!  I don't give a shit about BTC.
But man, now you're trolling?  Is that the online equivalent of "it was a joke"?  Such bad taste!  At least man up to what you've put out here on the internet...the same internet that Don John's Surf Shop is selling out.


I don't think you're a worse person, I think you're a terribly misinformed soul prone to manipulation.  You could be a great person for all I know, doesn't mean you don't do stupid shit.  I hope you're a great person.  I hope you go out there and do great things because that's how we grow as a society.


1. You have no way of knowing whether or not this statement is true.
2. There's more to life than money and once you cross a certain threshold, there's no real reason to go out of your way and get more (other than greed/power of course).
3. If you truly didn't care, you wouldn't be on this sub posting bullshit ;)

Oh no!  You've falsely grouped me with people you generally consider "bad" so you can continue with your delusions--all while ~~struggling~~ failing to come up with a coherent sentence.  I'm so upset.

Ah yes, I forgot BTC started at $15k and that crypto isn't extremely volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:46:24
Good for you, bud.  I'll get more from the tax "reform" too (lol at "alone" implying there's more "good" coming from this dumpster fire of a president), doesn't make it a good idea.
Maybe you can use all that money to buy a brain that can think critically...or some longer eyeballs.
