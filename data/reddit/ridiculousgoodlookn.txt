Thanks everyone. I recieved my coins an hour ago. I guess it just takes a while sometimes.

Thanks, this was just the type of response I was looking for. I am not too familiar with the big players in bitcoin yet, but I am learning. I just wanted to review this opportunity as it seems like it could have great potential for the person buying the coins.

What website or program do you use to generate the wallets?
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:43:36
To be honest, not very quickly (5 days?). If I want to buy an altcoin I will just place another order on coinbase and wait.

Does coinbase technically still have my private keys if I use their paper wallet generator?

I haven't even gotten my bitcoin back yet. I also still have some nautiluscoin in there as well.

This is what nautiluscoin was supposed to have. Nautiluscoin had a stabilization fund, a hedge fund that would provide liquidity, and a dynamic interest rate that would be fixed to some sort of yield such as treasury bills. It seems too hard to fix the value, especially when the value comes at the expense of the creators i.e. GPUcoin

I understand. My bid would be the $200,000 minimum to enter.

Sorry about this guy's but I have to go to an exam for the next 3 hours.  Thanks to anyone who responds and I'll be back when I finish my exam.

On the withdrawal screen of cryptsy ,  there is a box with "conf".   It was pending for a while and then turned into yes.

Seems logical. I was thinking there might be the bystander effect where everyone thinks someone else will purchase it. Of course there will be the two exchanges bidding for the coins, but I don't think they will have the full 18 million to purchase all the lots. This is a sealed envelope auction, if I am not mistaken, which makes thinks a little more interesting. My friends and I missed out on purchasing a house for a $1000 sealed bid due to the bystander effect.

It would be possible if there are only 3 other buyers who each spend 5 million dollars on 3 lots each and do not have the money to buy a fourth wallet. I find the sealed bid auction interesting and think it will have negative consequences on the selling price of the lots. I haven't heard many people declaring they will bid, probably due to the high upfront costs, and a low bid might sneak in a win. I believe that $200,000 is the price minimum to win but I may be mistaken.

How does this work? It's not a year long bet unless the money is bet a year before the payout.  Wouldn't it be best for the bettors to wait as long as possible before betting?

I might have solved my problem. Does the confirmation mean I confirmed through my email? Also, I withdrew the coins over an hour ago.
