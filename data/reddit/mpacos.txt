I tried that and it didn’t work

I know they’re not lost because I used a website to check my balance, But how do I get them out so I can use them? It won’t sync it just keeps crashing

That’s the problem though, it’s impossible to create enough space. My computer keeps crashing and I completely wiped my computer clean to do this. I lost everything including music, pictures, videos, downloaded school work, apps like all the Microsoft apps for school and more. I was trying to figure out a way I can transfer the bitcoin to another wallet, I tried doing it in electrum because I found a website with a step by step process but it was posted a couple years ago and electrum is a little different now so it was formatted different

I bought them from coinbase

How do I do that lol

I got my private key from core, but when trying to put it into electrum it didn’t give me the option to use it

I wanna say the key started with a 3 so maybe it is public? Only problem is bitcoin core won’t even open know because there is no space. I’m not sure what to do:/

Already done that! Deleted all files music pictures everything:(

I have a hard drive that’s a couple terabytes but I don’t know how to use it with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-04-03 22:11:31
In electrum it says the amount which is correct and at the top it says “imported, watching only”

I got bitcoin core to open back up, how do I do the prune mode? I’m assuming that means it will take up less space so it can fully sync to my laptop so I think that might work

No no hahah everything except it! All my music downloads (except bitcoin), apps, pics, everything 
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:06:42
I followed directions that I found online to export to electrum. It never gave me the option to make a watch only wallet or else I wouldn’t have done it, it did it on its own
