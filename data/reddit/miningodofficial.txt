Here in Croatia we have bitcoin-mjenjacnica.hr and we can sell unlimited amounts of btc a day.
They payout in maximum 36hrs depends of the day in a week and cross-bank transaction delivery time..
I've been using this site many times, sold $50k of btc around christmas last year and get my money in 4 hours since im in the same bank as they are and I sold btcs early in the morning.
This is only trusted solution I know and it's local to me..
If you need any help, let me know..

So? Account must be created once.
Btw, miningod.com is created before 6 months.
Just want to say that we need to begin from somewhere to achieve something.
