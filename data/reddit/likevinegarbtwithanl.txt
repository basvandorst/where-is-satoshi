Hypothetically, if a group of people relied upon fradulant advice given from the Bitcoin twitter account and bought Bitcoin Cash (BCH) thinking they were buying Bitcoin (BTC) and suffered great losses, how would you defend Twitter in court (if it came to that) for their part in facilitating the fraud? Would your argument be "that is what decentralization is all about"? If yes, is this because you feel that people should fully research the technology and the environment before investing? Do you feel like that new comers getting burnt is a natural part of making people stronger in some way? (not having a go I'm just trying to understand your point of view)
Also what happened with United Bitcoin? Did they also own that twitter account? (Sorry, I don't use twitter so don't know)

This has been my feeling too for some time but when I read the emails between Satoshi and Hal they really seem like different people (or Hal really went to great lengths to create that impression!).

Of the 32.4 million people in the world who are blind, many don't have to be. If you were to donate $25AUD to the Fred Hollow's Foundation it would restore sight to 1 person who otherwise would likely remain blind.
In 2013 The Fred Hollows Foundation was recognised by The Global Journal as number 43 in the Top 100 NGOs in the world.
No bitcoin address but I will assist them set up a wallet if you are interested (and will get them to declare that I was never aware of their private key).

Yes, you're right. How do I do this?

The ideology of the separation of money and state. He speaks for me. I will NEVER sell. I'm not here for a quick buck. I invest because it's time for a change.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:21:00
No, I don't think it does. A more globally accepted definition of a scam would be a "dishonest scheme". Like for example pretending you are something you are not. 
If I were to create a new coin called Bitcoin Cash Classic. Would I be right in thinking that you would feel that I wasn't a scam but I was only infringing copyright and that would be ok with you even if the people you love got tricked into buying something from me when they were trying to buy something else? Or have I misunderstood you?

Yes, please be careful when investing in fiat and for god's sake do not take out a bitcoin loan so you can buy more fiat. Fiat investors can easily be enticed into thinking their money is secure and within their control.

Yeah not FUD. It looks FUDish because the title is not descriptive and assumes everyone knows the relationship between ADM and CBOE and what's happening with Bitcoin Futures but it doesn't seem like FUD for malicious purposes. I appreciate the information.

Which company do you feel controls bitcoin?

If I copied Microsoft Word, tweaked it, put a new logo on it and started selling it as Microsoft Word Plus... would you still be asking what exactly makes it a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:01:30
lol me too especially when it started talking about octodecillion dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:20:36
I'm with you. You get it. It takes a while for people to get it. But sooner or later when the icy finger of the corrupt and greedy kicks them in the ass they will run to join us and THAT is why Bitcoin will eventually and effortlessly drain fiat out of the entire world. 
Bitcoin is not asking the corrupt and greedy for permission to do a god damn thing and those that base their existence on fiat are scrambling because deep in their hearts they suspect the end is coming. They sense it, they smell it, and they feel..... fear.

When you say things like "restore faith" and "save bitcoin" what are your references that indicate that faith was lost or that bitcoin needs saving?

YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT TRUST ANYONE WITH YOUR PRIVATE KEY EVEN IF IT HAS A PASSPHRASE. It can be brute force cracked. It is completely irresponsible for you to advertise this service.

Actually, I didn't realise there were so many alt coins that had the name "bitcoin" in them! Actually there are 29 of the 1372 listed on 
I suspect that few people has a problem with the other forks because they don't try so hard to be BTC. If they were pushed on bitcoin.com for example I think others would have a problem with them.
It may be a cultural difference but I would feel compassion to you and your family if you purchased something under false pretences. I understand you perhaps do not feel that way about me and my family but that is ok. Thank you for the discussion and I hope your transactions go through quickly!

Yes. Bitcoin is only a baby in terms of its development but its been attacked in every way imaginable and yet continues to grow unphased. I can't wait to see how it will be further refined over the coming years. We're only just getting started.

I've been using BTC Markets and CBA for the past 4 months. My first deposit (using Poli I think) I got an SMS message from CBA asking me to confirm but after that I've had no trouble at all.

Yes, it is interesting timing but makes me wonder why anyone would want their government to spend their tax money into setting up eAUD anyway. Isn't it like the government setting up their own Internet. We already have the Internet (for the world) we don't also need an American Internet, Canadian Internet and an Austalian Internet, etc. Just makes them look kind of desperate and out of ideas.

You forget the people who are new to crypto. When I first joined it was because of people on reddit pointing out the difference between bitcoin and bcash that I was able to make sensible, informed decisions. I thank them for it.

Suspicious that you only do it after a lot more alternatives to CMC come online and I'm sure many may think it's too little too late but I'm starting to feel a lot more positive about you guys now.

Paypal is a truly horrible organisation. Anyway, it won't be with us for much longer.

"Having access to the internet" and "using the internet" are two different statistics.
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:53:02
In my experience there is absolutely nothing decent about Paypal. I've personally experienced them holding on to people's funds for an extended duration with no good reason. Very unethical behaviour.

Absolutely and there should be a member assigned whose only purpose is to provide assurance of transparency and anti-corruption.

Ok. Now I get it. This is the first thing that should be explained. It's growing on me now.
