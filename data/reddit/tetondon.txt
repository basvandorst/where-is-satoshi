Government creates *additional* R&amp;D beyond the free market demand (X) for R&amp;D. Without this government created demand (Y), there would be less demand (X + Y &gt; X).

Start off with easy internet transactions. Get them a credit card or debit card or something, then show them how to do online transactions with that. It's kind of the "easy mode" of online transactions. And the good thing about that is if they screw something up, you can always revert the transaction. No money lost, no foul.

Whoa! What just happened here?
I'll tell you what happened. The hopes of bitcoin ever becoming big just died. 
People said it doesn't cost to add bitcoin as payment, and those people were idiots because it costs programmers to add it as an option, it costs to train people to use a new payment system etc.
Of course, it's obvious these people aren't good at "big picture" thinking, because they said bitcoin transactions don't have any fees. Of course when anyone tries to do these "transactions without fees" in the real world, they always end up with less money after the transaction. It's almost as if these people ignore the lost money on the spread from buy/sell as a fee. Bitcoin does, when its fiat, but for some reason it doesn't apply to bitcoin.
When you look at the big picture of bitcoin, it sucks. It's dead.
There is NO reason for it (unless you buy drugs over the Internet).

But eventually the difficulty will reset. And every machine that is profitable will be turned on, including ones not running at the moment because they are unprofitable at this difficulty. Hashrate will reach an all time high.
Then the difficulty resets. If the price didn't raise in the interim, even less machines will be profitable than before, and hashrate will crash again.

OP is wrong
It's 1940. The Nazis have taken Copenhagen. They are literally marching through the streets, and physicist Niels Bohr has just hours, maybe minutes, to make two Nobel Prize medals disappear.
...it was slow going, but as the minutes ticked down, both medals were reduced to a colorless solution that turned faintly peach and then bright orange. By the time the Nazis arrived, both awards had liquefied inside a flask that was then stashed on a high laboratory shelf. 
...Back in Denmark, de Hevesy did a remarkable thing. He reversed the chemistry, precipitated out the gold and then, around January, 1950, sent the raw metal back to the Swedish Academy in Stockholm. The Nobel Foundation then recast the prizes using the original gold and re-presented them

Double the efficiency, you just double the number of miners.
Take the block reward. Multiply it by the price. And that is how much electricity the mining network will converge on. If they are below this, it makes sense to mine more as it is profitable. If they are above it, it makes sense to mine less because it's not profitable. The mining efficiency has nothing to do with this. Mining efficiency just determines the hash rate at which stability is reached.

Nothing about this on the front page, so naturally people coming in make new posts (because if everyone on the bitcoin network were receiving unsolicited bitcoins, surely that would be on the front page).

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention all the cryptography research that bitcoin is built off of, was government funded.
Because private companies only use "just good enough" private security. Which works, until it doesn't (see "Target breach"). 
The very argument that these private *centralized* companies are shit, and bitcoin isn't, and also government is *always* the worst, is borne out of a complete inability to realize cognitive dissonance. 
It honestly is a probably an autism spectrum disorder. How else could r/bitcoin take an article saying bitcoin is the "wild west," (as in the pop-culture idea of the wild-west) yet respond with "That's not true! The real wild west was actually pretty orderly!" without any hint of self-denial or self-awereness?

Where have I heard this before?
"Warrens Lost it"
In 1999, after Berkshire reported a very small net increase per share for its investors, several newspapers ran stories about the demise of Warren Buffett.  As the high-tech stock run up continued into 2000, Warren Buffett was considered by some of the more “go-go” investors of that day as something of a “has been” – an investor who had peaked who was even called “extinct” for staying out of high tech stocks.  He was seen as a “your-father’s-Oldsmobile” investor at a time when all the kids were buying up those hot, high-tech Lamborghini type stocks.  Buffett was skeptical of high-tech stocks and how they made money. Buffett’s remarks, though politely received, were seen as out of touch with the “new paradigm” of high technology and ever-rising internet stock valuations.  He warned of an overvalued market that was heading for trouble. In fact, at that famous summer gathering of media, technology and financial moguls at Sun Valley, Idaho, Warrren Buffett was asked to give the concluding talk in July 1999.  His remarks, though politely received, supported the view among the smart set that **Buffett was out of touch with the “new paradigm”of high technology** and ever-rising internet stock valuations.
Buffett’s talk  — complete with stock market history, slides and charts, careful Warren Buffett reasoning, and a share of corny examples – delivered a message that most of his high-tech listeners and their financial sidekicks were not keen to hear.  There was no “new paradigm,” Buffett said.  The market could only yield what the economy produced, and this market was way out of sync in that respect.

And before you yell "statist," in your myopic black and white world view, recognize some of us have a more realistic view of the universe where we understand both governments and businesses both do good and bad. And we have to try to balance that to maximize the good and minimize the bad, and in our world nothing will ever be 100% good or even 100% bad.

Overstock is selling with bitcoin! 1/4 of those sales in the past 30 days were in the first 2 days during the hype. And the advice here was to buy with bitcoin, then rebuy the bitcoin you spent. Totally not an effort to pump.
Some kid holds up a QR code and everyone is like "send him money and show how altruistic the bitcoin community is!" (which will increase interest and make us all rich).
It's pretty transparent really. Unless you're doing remittance, there is almost no benefit with bitcoin. But there is a hell of a lot more counterparty risk, and that's even with the well established companies.

No. They lend it out at a higher interest rate to make more money.
Now why would anyone agree to a high interest loan in a deflationary economy? If inflation is -5% (deflation) taking out a 5% loan is the equivalent to taking out a 15% loan when there's 5% inflation.

Another misunderstanding is the insistence that it will all fail because of a 51% attack after mining centralizes.
The network could very well implode when the economics of running mining operations that are trying to AVOID a "51% attack" cause them to go bankrupt. 
If miners don't expand fast enough, the ever increasing hash rate leaves them in the dust. If the miners successfully expand, they leave those that don't behind, necessarily increasing centralization. If operations start to go bankrupt, the remaining hash rate may be too low for a large operation to mine at 100% capacity while staying below 50%. They will have to turn off machines, making them expensive dust collectors and monuments to over-investment. This is a hard environment to profit in. 
Will the system hit a stable equilibrium? It could, but nature abhors stability.

Not necessarily. Bitcoin is called secure (resistant to 51% attack) based on how expensive it is to have 51% of the network.
Right now that cost is about $30 per transaction. 
In order to get that cost down, we need either more transactions per block, a higher fee per transaction, or a lower mining reward. (Or some combination of all 3).
A higher fee per transaction is a no go. It means bitcoin sucks by all measures.
A lower mining reward may work, but that directly goes against the "it costs too much to launch a 51% attack" thesis. Transaction fees are about 11 BTC per day^1. People will need to pay about 327 times the fees they do now to have the same "cost of a 51% attack." I.e., for what miners are paying to operate their mines, bitcoiners have to pay 326 times more per transaction to have the miners make the same, and therefore have the cost of a 51% attack be the same. EDIT: The following "note" is wrong. Sorry END EDIT (Note, this assumes bitcoin is already at its theoretical capacity, which it is not)
EDIT explained:  It's going off its current rate of transactions. Not the theoretical max.
But that doesn't have to happen. We could have 327 times more theoretical maximum transactions per unit of time. And then the amount miners make will be the same without the block reward. But almost everyone agrees if bitcoin is used this much more, it's price will be higher. Which then means the cost for performing a 51% attack will be the exact same as it is now, so even though the cost of making that attack is the same as now, the reward is more, meaning the cost to reward is cheaper..
TL;DR: This technology has yet to prove it's workable on anything close to a large scale.

He said Satoshi solved the Byzantine General's problem - he didn't. We don't believe it is unsolvable, we *know* it is. It's been mathematically proven.
Satoshi made a mechanism that made it reliable *if* no one got &gt; 50% of the deciding nodes, based on probability. But the Byzantine Generals' problem has always been based on probability, so this isn't a "mathematical" solution, just possibly a "practical" one.

Also, I know how dumb people of your faith are. You have a binary brain incapable of comprehending nuance.

I hate this shat. It's backed by THE EXACT SAME THING AS GOLD - the human belief that another human holds that it has value.
Value is a social construct. The idea that there is such a thing as "inherent value" is the myth. Does anyone think they can get in a time machine to prehistoric times and buy tools more easily with gold than with glass beads? Hell, we throw aluminum away, but 200 years ago aluminum, in it's metal "throw away" form was worth more than gold.
And this rant also applies to anti-fiats. Fiat money in northern Iraq had value AFTER the backing government collapsed. (See wiki's fiat money)
Value is like Vary's riddle in game of thrones. A king, a rich man and a priest command a sell-sword to kill the others. Which does he obey? Answer: power lies where people think it lies.

I have to agree. Although, usual technobable bullshit is more obvious. This stuck out "This is due to the shockingly-faster switching speed which corresponds to the time light takes to propagate inside of the transistor." The difference between the speed of light and the speed of electrical signals is no where near the difference between their 2000nm tech and 25nm silicon. Granted, if what they describe is true, they don't have to wait for transistors to charge (i.e. the time savings isn't from the signal from transistor to transistor, but rather how fast the transistor switches).

How many of these people lost money on credit cards? Some where around zero. Some got money stolen, and the CENTRALIZED credit card company reimbursed them and ate the cost. How can they do this and not go out of business? FEES. Those evil things bitcoin gets rid of. Think about that for a second. REALLY think about it.
That's a fundamental problem that stops bitcoin from acceptance. Ignoring it, or pretending it doesn't exist, or down voting posts acknowledging, it doesn't make it go away. Day in and day out this reddit is filled with posts of people losing their money. And this reddit isn't even a hundredth of 1% of credit card users.
If you truly believe the free market will get rid of bad actors, you won't buy bitcoin.

It's weird that this is not being talked about anymore, but 180,000 bitcoin are moving from what seems to be a Gox account.
Whether this is a hacker moving coins to offload, or Gox moving coins for customers (that they will offload - also seems weird, that should be illegal if they're filing bankruptcy). Either way, it should mean a higher expected "sell" volume. 
Honestly, the lack off updates on this is weird. I swear I have economic OCD, so I follow this shit with obsession, just to see exactly how it plays out. I don't even own bitcoin, and I seem more interested in these transactions at the moment than @_date: 2014-09-26 00:47:46

Granted, the French Frank and German Deutchmark didn't technically fail, they just converted to another fiat. And there are other that have done similar things.
So if you take all the fiat currencies that no longer exist, and you remove the ones that didn't fail, they ALL failed! No! Seriously! This is mind blowing stuff. If you don't believe me you can check any site that will take your fiat and give you valuable gold in exchange - those guys are saints.

So the fix is bandwidth only able to be handled by massive mining companies, which will have their revenue from rewarded coins cut in half over night. Massive companies that will have other massive companies competing, making profit margins far under the 50% overnight coin cut, resulting in a mass of bankruptcies from mining companies.
At this time expect the difficulty to go chaotic (low, high, low high) ultimately ending in one company getting 51%, at which point the price crashes, the 51% + company finally goes offline because that price can't support their operation,  followed by days between blocks, people forever waiting for the next difficulty reset.  
A 5% drop in coin rewards is one thing, a 50% drop when things are mature and stable (i.e. efficiency is pushed to the max) is something else.

You don’t hear from the Treasury. You can knock almost any investment and nothing happens. But when you talk about gold it’s different. Of course that says something about their motivation for ownership. They want people to agree with them. They want everybody to get so scared they run to a cave with gold. Caves might be a better investment than gold. At least they’re not producing more caves all the time. So they want people to be as afraid as they are. Incidentally, they’re right to be afraid of paper money. Their basic premise that paper money around the world is going to be worth less and less over time is absolutely correct.

But I digress)
That doesn't work. You need to value add. Like say, realize storing every book, no matter how obscure, in every bookstore you own, isn't physically possible. 
Now if you have a central warehouse, where you can cheaply store 100 copies of "How to cook Norwegian Elk Hound in Salisbury sauce," that the whole world demand for that book can access on a website, you've **value added**. (Even better if you bought those out of published books for pennies on the dollar). See: "amazon.com." (again, if you're too young to remember, Amazon was *the* place to go to get books you couldn't find at a book store. (they were originally just a book store) It wasn't just about cheaper rates - i.e. "value added.")
 No one is on the Internet looking for out of production pet food, and no one is looking for something to convert their money into so they can "one click buy" (again, see: amazon.com) on the Internet, because *they already can.*

Each block has a timestamp. The value of the timestamp can vary by a few minutes. 
Let's say miner 1's clock reads 12:00, and at the same time miner 2's clock reads 11:50.
If miner 1 finds block-1, and miner 2 finds block-2 8 minutes later, the timestamps will show block-2 being found 2 minutes before block-1.
Technically, it's not as much the time difference on their clocks, it's that they can change the timestamp a little bit to find a winning hash.

That doesn't work. One can be completely reckless with $100, and not learn anything from a loss, then get irrationally excited about "potential" gains.
When you start betting real money, and you are betting, you won't even follow the same game plan you had with $100. EDIT: The psychology is way different. I've had a stock were I could have made a potential 20X gain, there is no way you see a 1% move with 20X the money the same way you do with 1X.

I have to go to bed soon, so I will answer this question for you.


Yep! And they will seek the highest reward vs risk.
The fed, buying T-Bills lowers T-bill interest rates. This makes T-Bills a less desirable investment, forcing people into other investment instruments. Driving the value of those instruments up. 
I.e., the fed buying T-Bills increases the demand for stocks, driving stock prices up. 
So if you think QE drives up stock prices, when T-Bills go from around 3% to around 2%, you HAVE TO believe that T-Bills going from around 2% to around 3% will DRIVE DOWN investment in companies.
MATHEMATICAL FACT.
If you believe that small movement in T-Bills will move the investment in stocks, you also HAVE TO believe deflation beyond that percent will move EVEN MORE from the stock market.
I.e., in order to avoid being a mathematically proven hypocrite, You CAN NOT simultaneously believe QE is driving stock price higher, WHILE believing deflationary currency will not hinder investment in companies.
MATH FACT.
And you know what the beauty of math is? It's NOT opinion.

It's not even inflation or deflation that's bad, it's the standard deviation, and the gold standard had a shitty standard deviation. (Bitcoin is far worse too)
@_date: 2014-04-05 15:08:33
It's basically 7% over inflation.
So if money deflates 10% per year, the stock market will only decrease 3%. Which is still worse than the money itself, so it would be better to hold than invest, so no one would invest, making the stock market an even worse investment.
Of course this dries up capital for companies, causing less creation of goods. Money chasing less goods causes the value of the money to increase, i.e. deflation.
There should be a name for this spiral of deflation.

There have been trading experiments, that went something like this:
Everyone was given a share, worth say $15. Every "period" (say 10 minutes) that share paid out $1. After 15 periods there was no more payouts.
With this frame work, one could value the stock at (original price) - (dividend). So after 1 period, it was worth $14. After 15 periods, it was worth 0.
So they tracked what people would trade (i.e. value the stock) over the time period.
People consistently overvalued the stock, and traded between each other, hoping to make profits off the trading, despite knowing the stock was worth less than the trading value.
This is pretty much the real world version of that, IF what the PBOC is going to do what people think.
Food for thought.
If there is real clarification that this will happen before the 15th, I expect a steady decline until the 15th. If that clarification doesn't happen UNTIL the 15th, I expect a sharp drop on the 15th. If there is no clarification, and it doesn't happen, it's up for grabs.

No, it's an easy choice. The small consistent change.
If miners are spending $0.90 in electricity for every $1 in bitcoin, the small change will allow unprofitable miners to slowly drop out, and allow the difficulty to slowly change.
If miners are spending $0.90 in electricity for every $1 in bitcoin, and their reward halves overnight, they're spending $.90 in electricity for every $.50. Almost everyone would have to shutdown. With almost no one mining, the difficulty will take a long time to ever adjust. If that happens, I find it hard to belevei that confidence in Bitcoin won't spiral downward, causing the price to plummet, causing mining to be even less profitable, causing more miners to shutdown - Bitcoin over. 
A block reward halving isn't an event if miners aren't close to saturation (say, spending $.1 for every $1 in bitcoin). But when miners are close to saturation, it could be devastating. 
Sure miners might prepare for the adjustment by holding off buying more equipment, so the difficulty will keep them below $.5 on electriticy per $1 mined, but that's a big "might."

The number of miners depends on price and difficulty.
The difficulty depends on the number of miners.
We have a feedback loop here - impossible to predict.
I don't think it will do much, because the price doesn't really depend on number of miners or difficulty - unless the price decreases so much, that so many miners go offline, that it ends up taking too long to process transactions until difficulty can be reduced, causing people to lose faith and reducing price further.

You overload a network with what looks like valid data, so it has to use resources to process it, with no intent on using the returned data.
For instance TCP uses a 3-way handshake to initiate a connection. Goes like this:
sender: Hi server! I want a connection. (now you wait for the server to respond back)
server: Ok, here's a connection. (now the server waits for you to respond back)
sender: Ok server, I've got the connection.
A DOS on a server could be done by sending tons of "Hi, I want a connection" requests, but then not bothering to even wait for a response. The server would open up partial connections to wait for your response, until it ran out of memory/valid sockets (resources) to listen on. Basically making the server inoperable until the requests timed out.
In other words, you have found a way to deny service from that server.
That particular DOS has been delt with though, for the most part.

I don't know. Read the article?
"And to do that, as Paul McCulley of Pimco put it, Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble. Judging by Mr. Greenspan's remarkably cheerful recent testimony, he still thinks he can pull that off."
"Mr. Greenspan needs one to avoid awkward questions about his own role in creating the stock market bubble."
PS, why don't you look at what the  McCulley he "agrees with" is saying?
McCulley is saying Greenspan thinks he can stop a double dip by creating a housing bubble. McCulley calls it "hedonism" 
 
Greenspan - "the level of unrealized capital gains in homes continues to rise apace. So it's not a depleting asset, if I may put it that way. It could be, but fortunately it is not" 
McCulley - "Fortunately, it is not" Those were the magic words: Greenspan has put his PUT beneath housing's wings.
 
McCullye's entire article is criticizing GREENSPAN for trying to make a housing bubble. THIS IS THE GUY KRUGMAN WAS QUOTING.
Almost without exception, people that criticize Krugman deliberately lie by misquoting him.

The guy has beer label OCD. Perfect guy for the job actually. 
If you seen the beer labels that I've seen approved, this guy isn't the problem. I was trying to find some crazy ones, ones the local populace got pissed about, Utah if I recall correctly, but as far as I know, getting beer labels approved isn't the problem (other than *only* this 1 guy, no matter his fetish for looking at beer labels, isn't enough to approve them, so it takes time)
But if you liked that link, I'm pretty sure there is more (requires some googling, I learned it from books on home-brewing and the like). Beer control, paid off by the likes of Budweiser et al, has a lot of things like the from other states. And now most of those guys aren't even American owned.

If you don't understand the limitations of the technology, you're not going to "get it".
We're not just talking about bandwidth here.
Let's talk about verifying each transaction through 1, 2, 10 terabytes of data. How many can we do each second. As the blockchain becomes longer, the less we can do. Infinite bandwidth doesn't solve that issue. 
This isn't  a simple centralized ledger, where each user has a single account with a balance. This is something where it's *recommended* you create a new "account" (address) with each transaction. So now you have to go back and check the previous account to see if it's balance is correct, and the next one and the next one. 
Now you have to do that 2000 times per second, through terabytes of data...

It solved it in a centralized manner - like every other functional transaction network on the planet. That made it technically functional. That's NOT opinion. Period. It didn't work because people didn't want to use, like bitcoin.
No one gives a fuck if their transaction network is centralized or decentralized when making legitimate purchases. That's a complete red herring. 


No, I already knew all of that, and unlike you, I also realize it doesn't amount to a hill of beans. You know how you're sitting here wondering how in the hell your bitcoin investment's price is going down? I'm not. So stop acting like you have a clue.

Quantitative easing isn't anything close to the "printing money" that was done in classic hyper-inflation economies. There they literally fired up the printing presses at the Treasury, which hasn't happened here.
One thing I can guarantee, is when the Fed sells the bonds they bought, the people saying they're "printing money" by buying them aren't going to say they're "burning money" by selling them. Because the people saying that are trying to sell gold. They're pretty bad people to get economic advice from.

He's right. Don't try to time markets. Famous quote: "The markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
For long term, put a good portion of your money in stock indexed mutual funds. Use dollar cost averaging. Keep some cash, and some in highly speculative shat like bitcoin.
Some think they can beat the markets, and 5% of them will perform 2 standard deviations better than the market - which randomly thrown dice will *also* do. Minus the statistical terms, that just means random chance means some people can win, and it will just be random chance (but don't tell them that).

There are bears and bulls, who think a market will go down or up respectively.

It accomplishes transactions, and it does this at about $10 per transaction. Ignoring this fact is futile.

Exactly. There's no company to be an "insider" in. Here we just have someone that see ahead of everyone that their are huge buy/sells coming, and can jump in front of them.
This is *worse* than regular insider trading where the "insider" merely *suspects* something will cause big buys/sells. This is someone that KNOWS they will.

Gold supply has never increased that much in modern times. But it could, because it has, the 1500s.  So at least people understand that much.
Now why has gold value decreased 33% since 2011? It's not supply.
Like I said, there is no such thing as a deflationary currency. Can't exist.
And that's the thing the "LOL Kenyans!" Crowd never understands. They say "well, if everyone expects deflation, it can work! Loans etc etc can account for that!" Maybe that's true, but there is NO WAY to have a predictable deflationary currency. Even when gold was mined at a predictable rate, it fluctuated +20% -20% anual inflation. Bitcoin won't solve that. 
Sorry if empirical reality proves your theories wrong. If you respond to that, like mises.org, that you should ignore empiricism, you're going to be wrong. And the response "just because reality proves us wrong doesn't mean it proves you right!' Well no shit. that's not how science works. One can prove shit WRONG, then it's discarded. One can NEVER prove a theory right. Ever. It's how logic works. If you say "well yeah, that empirical evidence proves us wrong, but it doesn't prove you right!" you've already lost scientifically.

That's possible. I find it less likely though, because concentrating is sort of the opposite of decentralizing. They are slightly different, so again, I think it's possible, but not likely.
If hashrate continues increasing, when fewer and fewer areas can mine profitably, then mining gear is certainly being concentrated into the hands of fewer people.
Why farms? If I'm poor, I might be able to buy a mining machine, I won't be able to send it somewhere with cheap electricity. If I'm rich, I can buy 100 machines. I can also rent/buy a warehouse in an area with cheap electricity. So rich people all over the world can mine in cheap areas. The only poor people that can mine in cheap areas are the poor that already live there. 
As difficulty increases, the rich that can afford to mine doesn't change, the poor that can afford to mine decreases. So the rich/poor ratio increases. A rich person mining will buy more machines than a poor person mining, so the number of machines per person mining has to increase.

@_date: 2015-02-17 08:27:10
Bitcoin can't be a regular currency, because it can't handle even a reasonable transaction volume.
In order for it to handle the needed transaction volume, people have to constantly transfer large amount of bitcoins to 3rd parties (who handle the transaction volume), in order to match the value of the transaction volume. If they DON'T transfer LARGE amounts, they have to transfer SMALL amounts in A LOT of transactions. This breaks the network.
And you are NOT supposed to transfer large amounts to 3rd parties.
If you're betting on bitcoin being big, it can't, unless you can safely store it with 3rd parties.

Can't hold large amounts of the currency of the Internet (bitcoin) on the Internet.
Can hold very small amounts of the currency with 3rd parties (a). These 3rd parties can only make very small value transactions (because of "a'") (i.e. very low volume of value).
You cannot transmit large volumes of value with this model, mathematically.

Yeah, and I'm John Maynard Keynes.
What I meant was that no real economist, with a real degree, from a real university, ever said that. I'm not talking about armchair economists from Youtube U. 
No economist has ever said price inflation has nothing to do with inflation. That is literally a contradiction in terms. Price inflation IS inflation, and monetary inflation is a possible contributor to that inflation. 
Pick up a god damn book on economics sometime. 
This isn't even an Austrian school vs Keynesian school issue. They both agree on this.  "**There is almost complete unanimity among economists and various commentators that inflation is about general increases in the prices of goods and services.**" [source](
PS. there are more bitcoins today than there were yesterday. This is real monetary inflation.

I do statistical analysis for a living. Here, read this. It describes why you think you understand something that is clearly above your head: 
For instance, you said "the log chart ~~hides~~ [shows] the actual trend" yet it clearly doesn't. It *compresses* the range value of interest, which *by definition* hides it.
Are you really that stupid you can't see that? 
No analyst would EVER choose a log chart for that data. Now if the USD volume kept going up at an exponential rate, you would. It would then look a like a line with positive slop. It didn't ever do that though, so there is no reason for any log chart. Protip: if you have a horizontal line on the NON-log chart, like the USD volume chart, you probably shouldn't be using a log chart. 
I know, I know. You want to hide the fact that USD volume is stagnant and not at all showing any growth. But that doesn't mean you should lie and try to hide that fact with a log chart.

Fix what. Central banks buying assets is no where near the same as treasuries printing money and throwing it out into the economy. The assets bought would have been sold otherwise, so the money that's "created" is the difference between the security rate paid without the central bank purchase vs without it's purchase. Also, if they were just printing money, there would be no way to destroy it. Not that you would understand the distinction. 
Fark it. Let's cut to the chase. Since you seem to believe you understand economics, explains Japan's QE in the early 2000s, and their very distinct lack of inflation.

Here's the math:
If China owns 50% of bitcoin, and they HAVE to sell, the rest of market cap gets diluted with 100% more share, meaning the price per "share" gets cut in half.
Now if bitcoin is a currency, and everyone just uses it to buy/sell things, that's what the price should do.
Now if a non-significant portion of bitcoin holders aren't using it for currency, but rather a speculative gamble (crazy, I know), what they should do, knowing the price will go down, is sell. Dropping the price even further than 50%.

Whenever that stock goes down, there's cries of "the MM's are manipulating," to "the crash of the OTC exchange was planned to prevent a run," and other wild accusations of some large conspiracy to bring down the stock price. Rarely, if ever, do they say, "a large number of holders are selling."

Made this little thing. I think it better represents the "logicality" (instead of the "physicality") of bitcoin. Public domain, have at it. Do what you want.
However, if you happen to like it, I would prefer you copy it to your own web service to share. Not necessary, but preferable.

In order to avoid imagined 25%-35% annual inflation, use bitcoin. There, a 25% drop in value can be realized in hours.

True. Technical analysis works, except when it doesn't.

Funny you only complain about panic selling.
Why not the panic buyers driving this up rapidly. To quote my sister whenever we got in trouble for fighting, "he started it!"
Both are equally bad for anything that wants to be a currency.

The one were the deficit and unemployment are declining, while inflation is at near historic lows? Yeah sure, "done deal."

No, I mean what happens to inflation when the Federal Reserve sells Treasury securities and mortgage backed securities.
