Is there anything that could be done to the extremely high transaction fees? Why will anyone prefer btc over bch if this situation persists for a longer timee?

Gemini is pretty good. You should give it a try.

Bitcoin is dead bruh. It was just a bubble. Invest in something meaningful like MF's.

Will this work if my friend chooses to fund the coinbase account through his debit card? Will the account need verification even if he uses his us debit card? What I'm planning to do is send him equivalent usd from my PayPal to his and make him use his American bank account debit card to pay and purchase btc in coinbase. Will it work?

Are you nuts lol. The only reason the increased so much is because of the herd mentality. Everyone buys because it's on the news and they're selling it because nobodys ready to Shell out 3000$ for a frickin crypto currency. People who wanted to make money have already made it. It's the people who bought at 2000 - 2700$ range who are gonna lose. There's no scope for bitcoin.

Guys I know this is not the right thread to ask, but need some help on this. I'm from India and the local exchanges cost us 300-400$ more than the rates in coinbase and other exchange sites. Since many sites need Id verification &amp; other authentication. Suggest me any way to purchase btc at a cheaper price please! I'm losing almost 350$ for every btc bought :(

Yes yes yes. I got a friend in Texas. He can create an account there. What do I do mate?

Yeah man. Thanks for the help. Could you suggest other alternatives to coinbase where I can ask my friend to buy without any verification?
