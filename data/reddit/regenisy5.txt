More bitcoin for me :)

Sorry, I mean I went to sell one of my bitcoins.  At the confirmation screen it said $80 CAD would be paid for 1 bitcoin.  I look at my CAD balence after the transaction and it went from 0 to $37 and there were no bitcoins anymore.

Be ready to defend it.  The two most predominant theories is that bitcoin is extremely hackable and some people believe it's inflationary, but as we know it's deflationary by design.  Bitcoin transactions are encrypted using SSL, a system that banks use.  So if they argue that somewhere, some way somone will hack it, tell them they had better get their savings out of the bank because it is just as likely that their bank account will get hacked.   I agree with everyone else.  They will want to know what's in it for them to use bitcoin.  It's cheap, it's fast, and it's easy.

Bitcoin would make it easier to do accounting because you can use the encryption keys to keep track of users.  It would be anonymous because bitcoin is anonymous by design, and it would add value to bitcoin because if it is started in bitcoin the industry would be reliant on bitcoin once it becomes big enough to overcome inertia.

Why do we have to choose between hoarding it or using it?  Bitcoin's current worth is being determined by it's potential.  There are very brave entrepreneurial spirits that are driving bitcoin's worth by creating new and innovative applications for it.  This is a new venture.  Granted, it could bust.  Luddites everywhere would sigh with relief that they for one instance had been proven to be right.  However, bitcoin is a black swan.  It is like the crude oil boom.  Oil didn't always have the value that it did today.  Oil had early adopters who worked hard creating new innovations and applications for it.  For a while the market was so saturated that it was being practically given away.  But it provailed because business evolved and seized its potential.  The same can very well be said for bitcoin.  It is a new comoddity in an over crowded economy.

Decentralizing the exchange is the smartest thing I've heard yet.  It is the fairweather snakes running the exchanges that ruined bitcoin for me.  During a down turn it is the least liquid asset on planet earth which makes it useless.  You couldn't even use effective hedging techniques.  Investors are lambs to the slaughter.  Latency is only part of the equation.  If it's digital, let it be digital.  Take the corruption out.

It's not in actions or pending.

1)  How do you plan on resolving issues of liquidity that arise from you shutting your doors after every attack?
2)  Why put all your eggs in one basket?
3)  Does it make sense to put all your faith in a currency that is 100% dependant on a central authority to rebel against a central authority?
4)  Why should anyone trust you?
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:34:09
Yeah.  You're using blockchain.  Good luck ever getting it out.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:27:07
I'm no expert on the subject.  But I know there are a couple of calculators out there that can help you figure out if mining's right for you.  From what I understand you want to join a mining pool to make the right kind of money.  Google "bitcoin mining calculator" and that should get you started.  Have your electric bill handy.  Good luck.

God I hope so.  I missed out.  Stuck at work.  To all the Noobs:  Happens every week.  It's part of the experience.  You'll learn the rhythm of the waves and you'll be a pro in no time.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  I bought at 72 and literally  the very next day it dropped.  After you get over the jitters you learn that this is all the way she goes.  If you want big money it comes with big risks.  Nobody knows when this will end.  Even these self proclaimed "bitcoin experts".  Pick a price to pull out at and stick with your gut.  That's all you got in this game.

It's inherent value would therefore be how you can use it.  (As is any currency)  More applications = More value.

Do you have any short term goals?  Remind him that an eliment of risk has it's place in any portfolio.  Risk=Gains.  For a short term equity Bitcoin is sure a good investment.  (Risk vs. Rewards)

Why the heck would you want to short bitcoin?  It creates huge bubbles and makes securities less liquid.  If everyone were able to short bitcoins then there would be no demand for new bitcoin during a drop.  I'm pissed that I wasn't able to cash in on the recent drop too but it'll make me more creative in how I choose to invest in it.  We're onto a good thing here.  Don't ruin it.

Thanks BitBeggar.  I'll consider it once I get to the development phase :)

Common.  Be nice.  @ ashwinmudigonda, go to blockchain.info/wallet, set up a new wallet like you did at MtGox, you should get a receive address for your new wallet.  Send funds from MtGox to your new wallet's receive address.  jt57 you were a noob once.
