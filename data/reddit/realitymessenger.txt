You may take off the tinfoil hat mate, I work in payments.
It is not the authorities. It's just the banks or a bug in the interface(s).
All that said, I am not defending Cex.io, they run their business very poorly, the ticket resolution times are a joke, the UI is plain infantile.
The authorities do not care about all transactions, this job is delegated in layers to the exchanges (small withdrawals, bigger withdrawals, withdrawals requiring different stages of verification) and then the banks.
The governments do not care for peanuts, they only get involved if the amount goes way beyond what an exchange and a bank can proceed.
In this instance, 99.99% of all cases, it is the poor API on the cex.io side period. The banks services work more or less flawlessly.

You did not earn trust, you are profiting from a market boom.
The negative feedback would never get online if you would just resolve the tickets.
This fig leaf reddit presence is a disgusting double faced practice of saving a face in public. You then handle the publicly escalated cases with higher priority, jumping the queue.
I know, this is a prepared statement ratified by your boss, you cannot say you are under staffed. Go back now and do your job resolving tickets, and tell your boss to lay off the standard excuses. Hire staff instead and implement a live chat or phone line.
The money you rake in should be enough for a couple more 8 quid an hour customer care reps.
