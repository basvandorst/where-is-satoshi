Same in the Swiss newspaper I read, except there, the article stated that Bitcoin "crashed" to $130 after Mt.Gox went down.
The comments were full of self righteous people saying how it is a Ponzi scheme and a bubble and how they knew it from the beginning and who is stupid enough to buy into this crap etc.
The level of ignorance was infuriating and the sensationalist journalism with false information (price on other markets was around $500, not $130) was enraging .

I want to, but MT.GOX verification takes 5 days and then another X for bank transfer or whatever?
Can't I buy some right now with PayPal or Visa or whatever?

Isn't Bitcoin designed to make banks obsolete!? (for the good of humanity, I might add)
@_date: 2013-08-16 11:03:15
Well anything really. The fact that it's currently more practical to first change it into dollars and then buy whatever you want, doesn't change the principle behind it.
Gold carries its own value, that's why it was used as currency in the first place, before virtual currencies (like USD) came along.

That's fundamentally different. Drugs have real value (they make you high), Bitcoin (or USD for that matter) doesn't. 
People want to get high whether it's legal or not. I doubt that people (especially businesses) want to use Bitcoin so badly that they will do it even when it's illegal.
And if businesses don't use Bitcoin, then the value crashes because what can you buy with Bitcoins anymore?

I think the recorder is okay, but somebody is typing in the background. I assume they are transcribing the conversation live, or making notes.
I don't know why you need to type a conversation you're also recording.

Sure. But have you ever thought about that maybe, just maybe, you would have to work only a fraction of your time to support yourself instead of all week, if a fair system was implemented instead of the current one?
A simple example would be this: If 100 years ago it took 80 farmers to grow and harvest 100 tons of potatoes, and today it takes only one farmer (thanks to advanced machinery/technology) - then how come those farmers aren't working half an hour each per week (40/80) and still make a living?
(Just made those numbers up obviously to illustrate what I mean).

Fuck all you who own bitcoins and made a fortune out of nothing.
You did nothing for society, provided no value, yet now you are millionaires because of some hype.
Fuck that, and fuck you!
(Yeah, I'm kinda pissed I never actually bought some coins even though being subscribed and interested for months. It's eating me up inside).
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:32:37


Well, of course, if you have $27,672 in any stock any movement will affect you by hundreds of dollars. It's the same as stock trading.
By the way, would it be a good time to buy Bitcoins now? I assume not since the course is at it's highest ever? (I'm a complete noob btw)

Yeah I guess you could buy a drink in a bar with an ounce of gold. Or a car on Craigslist with a pound.
But even if you can't, what is your point? Do you think Bitcoin will keep it's value once you can't directly buy anything with it (because banned), just because this is the case with gold?
@_date: 2013-08-16 09:25:47
Everyone here seems to laugh at them talking about "shutting it down" and how it really can't be. 
But what if governments do make it illegal? This would prevent local businesses such as bars/shops as well as legitimate online business from taking Bitcoins in the future and limit the potential of it. I assume Bitcoin would probably crash then and loose a lot of trust.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:02:14
So you're saying distribution of wealth is basically "fair" and that we shouldn't aim to change anything about it (as in taxing top earners to ease life at the bottom)?
And you're calling me delusional..
@_date: 2013-08-16 10:13:28
I see how they might not be able to technically stop Bitcoin, similar to BitTorrent. But if it's illegal then no legitimate business, online or offline (i.e. a bar/shop) can accept Bitcoins anymore. That would completely crash Bitcoin wouldn't it? After all the value of a currency derives from what you can actually buy with it.

@_date: 2013-08-16 11:15:40


As long as you can buy things with it, which you won't once it's banned. Now you might be able to still buy drugs on silk road alright, but you couldn't spend it in bars, stores, webshops, craigslist, etc. etc.
This limitation would make Bitcoin practically useless to most people, wouldn't it? And what good is a currency if nobody uses it?
@_date: 2013-08-16 10:37:08
What do you mean? It works the same way with gold. 
@_date: 2013-08-16 10:02:41
But what if governments make it illegal?

The way you wrote it kinda made it sound like you're not in favor of raising taxes on top, probably because you used "We could..., but...".
Anyway, I agree that there is always "work to do" for humanity to push forward. It's not my point that we should all work half an hour per week and spend the rest consuming and/or masturbating. But if you had to work only a small amount of time for your survival, you could still work the rest just for improvement of the world or whatever.
What I don't want to accept is that so much of the fruit of our labor goes to such a tiny percentage of very rich people, due to how the system is set up, and the federal banking system is a key part of that system, which in my opinion *IS* enslaving a lot of people. Just look at how many people need to work multiple jobs, work hard for minimum wage, or work for a few dollars per day to assemble our iPhones. All this is slavery for me.

Same happened to me with Fannie Mae stocks I bought years ago. 
I guess I'll just wait till Bitcoin goes down again and then buy some.
