Hello All in the Reddit world and especially the bitcoin Community! I have had an idea for spreading the bitcoin word, and getting more business and public people to adopt bitcoin for sometime now. This started a while ago back when Bitcoin was at its peek. Now that I have the time to peruse this opportunity I will be sharing my ideas with the community as well as looking for ideas and feedback that will help further my new journey. I will also be asking for donations to help start the mission, while I have the time and mental capability to explain bitcoin to business and the public, I do not yet have the finical stability to  drive this task to the next level. In addition to supplies I will need to start a business accepting bitcoin, I will also need personal items such as reliable transportation that I do not have at the moment. You see I'm not looking to stop in Midland, TX. I'm looking to go to big cities Dallas and Houston and the out of state and finally out of country and to the world. One guy going from business to business, person to person. Eventually building a sales team, taking seminar opportunist when they arise. See I am but one man with a dream that I want to peruse I see all these start up ideas everywhere and people seem to get help from online places all the time. Instead of sitting back and watching these stories happen again and again, I will be working on my power point and gaining knowledge so that I may be the next story. If you wish to donate please share this story with others and offer any help suggestions that you can. Thank you so much for all of your help in advance.
