Seems to me like the biggest hurdle against using **gold** in everyday transactions is the **inconvenience** of **storing** (security) and the lack of **divisibility**. Paper notes was a good way of solving this problem, but had an obvious **flaw** in that it could rather easily be **diluted** through issuing more claims on gold than there is gold in the vault. 
I find it pretty interesting that we might be going from a world that for centuries used derivatives of the underlying asset (paper receipts on gold/silver) to a world were the **underlying asset** (cryptocurrency) will the **premier form of transacting**. Seems to me like it solves the biggest problems with the gold standard.

Haha yeah I see that. Spotify is the bomb btw so u should look into that. They're on the podcast app on the iPhone as well.

Probably will go fast but people should brace for some downside too, particularly the people getting in around the highs

Does anyone know if Bitfinex's stance on this issue is somewhat similar on the other big exchanges?

If u sell your BT2 CST (chain split tokens) for BTC (That is BTC without claim on potential B2X) you are buying someones BT1 which after settlement on Bitfinex will be converted into "normal" bitcoin. So unless there is some leverage situation I'm not aware of I don't think u risk Bitfinex owing u anything. But hey, I could be wrong

True that, but u should keep in mind that the volume on the CST (chain split tokens) is not very big so it's up for discussion how representable that price is for how the B2X is gonna trade when/if it goes live. But kudos to bitfinex for making that. Pretty cool!

It for sure is tempting! For around 33% I'll do it
