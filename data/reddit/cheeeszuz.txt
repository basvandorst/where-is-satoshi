The Problem is there is a big difference between marketcap and Fiat put inside the Market because otherwise it would mean everyone paid the current market price and not cheaper in the past. A 2 Billion Cash out would have a massive impact IMHO but I‘m no expert in Finance.

Everyday the same... some random trader shorted too early and invents a nice Story to push the Price back (yes I think a reddit post in the Right subreddit has an impact).
OT: Cashing out is only slowing Cryptos in taking over the world so if you want to Support it just don‘t Cash out and you will also be Fine.

Too less fud and good news this week, I don‘t expect significant drop

Yeah the margins are mostly quite low but the risk is not very high so with the right amount of money �� 
But when you look at smaller currencies there can be money made also with smaller purses. Just look on trading view and you will see that also private persons are trading currencies :)

The difference with bitcoin is that the margins can be much higher but the risk is also a lot higher. This and the easiness to invest in bitcoin makes it more attractive to private persons.
