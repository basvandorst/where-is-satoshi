I tried a couple times over the past 2-3 weeks. The last time it worked, I ended up uploading a photo of my license and taking the laptop photo in super good light. Got denied several times when the lighting was off but they finally accepted it.

John McAfee would accept that trade I feel

True. It usually goes much much faster though. This is the first time I've had to wait this long. Hopefully it shows up soon.

Not sure if this is just on my site but Gdax seems to never log me out when I leave the page. I can go back to that site hours later and it pops right up into my account.

I put a couple bucks on yobit.net today, had no issues. 
Got verified fast, sent btc over, got there with about 30-45 mins, bought my alts, sent 'em to my wallets quickly.

Get an account on gdax which is owned by Coinbase.
Go to gdax and load your account with your btc balance from Coinbase (free).
Then, send from gdax to whatever local wallet you want to use (free).
Or, get an account on bittrex and send btc from gdax to bittrex (free) and then buy your alts.

I've given up hope. A long lost dream.

log into coin base, click "Accounts", i bet it's pending there with a notice at the top that they are slow af right now. i'm in literally the same boat lol. good thing we didn't buy alts last night though.
