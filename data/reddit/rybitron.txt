How do you plan to use bitstamp?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:13:09
Not sure if this is serious or not, but [significant figures](

You were born into a system with rules. Not that different from natural rules like gravity. Some rules are made by man, some are made by the cosmos.
You elect to follow the rules when you reap benefits from the system. Things like roads, education and even the internet itself.

If you round a little, I have 0 bitcoins as well.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:15:16
I've looked at a few people's comments and noticed lots of similar comments on a new account and that seems suspicious to me. 
I have also never seen so many drastically varying opinions in a single sub. 
But I could be wrong ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:39:20
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:26:39
Im still convinced there are a lot of people on here pushing hard on their personal or corporate agenda. I've never seen something like this so prevalent. 
Maybe I should join a stock exchange forum and see if its the same.
Or bitcoin has attracted tons of idiots. That might be a scarier scenario.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:06:16
or just 8. Who knows.

I just got bitstamp verified. Is there a pro/con list on bitstamp vs GDAX?
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:44:19
Why you got a 12 car garage, when you only got 6 caaaarrrrs.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:16:24
I'd buy some tron. At what point do I get a light cycle?
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:44:33
I have no actual evidence, but I swear there are people/bots in this sub that have their own (nefarious) agenda posting all the time here.

What's a good option for USB cold storage? Should I wait for the ledger nano s in late March?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:15:59
How often is the ledger nano S available from the manufacturer from their U.S. warehouse? Is there any problem with ordering several from France and reselling?
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:27:50
Thanks. I assume there is no way to verify that they have not been tampered with?
Should I order one from France or wait for them to be in stock in the U.S.?
@_date: 2018-05-08 04:35:31
I guess I’ll try it. Can I borrow yours?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:34:26
What is on the land doesn't really matter, its still land. If you own a forest or a desert, you still own land.
There has been minor additions of land in Dubai, South China sea and maybe a few other places, but its too small to make a difference.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:34:25
its only flawed if you can predict the future.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:20:17
all crypto news is bitcoin news. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:40:03
I hate it when I buy and it goes does down and when I sell and it goes it. That seems to happen too often.
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:57:36
There is some perspective right there.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:59:06
Right. checking 579,257 times per day is rough.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:21:58
bitcoin will go up. bitcoin will go down.
50% of the time, i'm right every time.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:19:26
2nd chair got promoted to 3rd chair. I think that happened to me once.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:25:21
The place where people and bots push their agenda.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:51:25
I mostly agree. I just think its possible for something really bad to happen and crash bitcoin to near $0
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:15:28
No, this is more than that.
Just a dip would have bottomed out around $12k.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:24:51
If a processor was made that solved these problems like computers can solve arithmetic, would bitcoin be dead? Do we know this cant happen, why?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:22:01
That's like saying they won't let you buy bitcoin when you are over your credit limit. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:38:52
I'm gonna go with no.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:49:43
Isn't a fraction of a fraction just a fraction?

Man, these GDAX charts are going nuts. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:16:08
Lots of blind people used to see.

OP is part of the system
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:53:36
I think I just got an email saying my ledger nano S will be delivered to my address today, original expectations were early April. The email is in French, so maybe I am missing something. Did anyone else get a similar email?
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:23:47
The stock market feels like bitcoin lately.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:38:14
lol. I just placed my lambo order. COD of course. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:02:20

@_date: 2018-02-09 15:30:13
gdax or anything really.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:19:30
I dont think this explains why they are no longer allowing bitcoin purchases. The banks will generally allow people to make tons of stupid purchases. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:50:20
happy cake day!
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:17:26
Let's make it... tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:17:07
Happy cake day
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:19:37
in asia?
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:11:55
Yea, if they could tell us what happens later today, I'd be golden. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:51:14
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:48:58
at least some one gets it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:11:03
Hard to say for sure, but a correction and bad news from India, South Korea and Tether make people really nervous. People are weary of a bubble pop, its almost a self-fulfilling prophesy, price goes down a little, people panic, people pull out, price goes down more and so on. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:00:33
The crash of 2018 seems a bit exaggerated at this point.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:47:47
I think im at that point of buy all the way in and forget about it for 9 months.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:06:21
I've strongly considered doing the opposite of what I think I should do, or setup random buys and sells. I might make better decisions that way.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:01:31
*Panic intensifies*
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:46:58
To be fair, we have 27 more days...
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:22:59
not if it kept falling.

The overall purpose of the altcoin can make a huge difference, also the marketing team.

If only people unsubscribed when they sold out. I would watch subscriber graphs on this sub.

Step 1: be a crypto-currency expert
Step 2: ????
Step 3: PROFIT

How much money are these exchanges making off fees? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:03:39
I've temporarily pulled out, let me know when to go in deep again. 
This isn't the first time I've said this. lol

@_date: 2018-03-08 18:14:58
Like he said, there isn't a previous deflationary currency, but land is deflationary. It would be reasonable to look at the demographics of people who own land as a proxy. Gold might be another example.
Do you have an example of deflationary currency that we could use as a comparison?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:33:34
winner, winner...
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:49:05
My life now seems less complicated, thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:10:37

@_date: 2018-02-05 21:54:55
Did she tell you there would be days like this?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:18:08
It takes more than money.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:54:27
well we are at the casino already, aren't we?
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:28:45
I agree, but banks can't repossess that vacation to Bora Bora I charged to my credit card, but they will allow the charge.
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:36:27
The price of an item in bitcoin will likely go up and down with the USD value of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:31:53
Lol, stick around a little longer and you will change your mind.
Lots of people have very different, very strong opinions on bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-29 04:09:28
I still cant see it going forwards.
