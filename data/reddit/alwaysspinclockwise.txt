Who is going be driving the price up like it did in the past? Price doesn't go up unless people are willing to buy at higher and higher prices. Are you going to do that? Past spikes have been driven by masses of new buyers flooding in. Now that everyone and their grandma knows about bitcoin and the general opinion is that it is magic internet money that crashed and burned a lot of people, where are those high-price buyers going to come from this time around? If holders want the price to go up to say 20k, you've gotta have buyers buying for 20k, and it's pretty hard to see anyone that that knows anything about how the whole thing works doing that again. Uninformed buyers drive the market, and there are a whole lot less of them this time around.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:20:22
what's going to cause the price to rise in 2020?
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:57:18
lol wtf

you just wrote two paragraphs to say "i'm right, ur wrong, try and be more right next time"

So we're basing the speculation for another bull market on "there's a sucker born every minute"?

Nobody said that.
For a market to rise, with every single buy that's higher than the last, an individual has to get fucked by paying more than the guy selling. You have to have individuals willing to get fucked by paying a higher and higher price, otherwise the cycle stops. The cycles are based on speculation, and the less informed buyer are, the more willing they are to risk their money to drive the cycle. As the pool of buyers becomes more informed, your cycles will have less to drive them. This last spike was significantly more public than any other in the past, and general public perception is noticeably changed. Acting like market cycles are just magic waves that go on and on forever regardless of investor perception and action is ridiculous.

I can promise he'll regret it a lot more when he decides to not break even and fucks himself even harder.
@_date: 2018-09-19 16:35:29
"traders, investors, hedge funds, etc" are going to be a lot more hesitant to tell people to invest in an asset that is now globally seen as having huge potential to instantly fuck over anyone who holds it unless they're doing it to pump their own holdings.
The cycle is just a summation of the actions of individuals, and it requires individuals who either understand the system and think they can beat it, or who don't know anything about it and just pour money in thinking it's a magic money printing machine. The last cycle killed off a huge percentage of the last group. That leaves you expecting the first group of knowledgeable buyers who understand the ins and outs of the system to continue buying as the price rises to the ATH or higher with the expectation that other knowledgeable buyers will take it even higher. You're expecting the same people who are sitting on their holdings right now, glancing around waiting for someone else to make a move, to just decide to switch and create their own bull market and start buying for higher and higher prices?
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:54:35
Except the cycle is clearly driven by uninformed buyers fueled by the media. What happens when you run out of those?
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:01:13
jesus man, based on your history you have two kids, and you're gambling money that's not yours to try and recoup your losses? get help man, this shit's not a game, you have people relying on you and you need to be better than that.
@_date: 2018-10-01 22:35:30


Are you going to buy for 40k? I'm not going to buy for 40k. A fucking lot of people have to be buying at 40k for the price to hit 40k.
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:27:10
I've been involved just as long, but you have to realize that the price is a direct reflection of the perspective of each individual buyer. That price spike isn't going to magically appear out of nowhere. It requires a gigantic spike of new individuals willing to purchase bitcoin for a price higher than it's ever gone, in the hopes that it won't screw them over like it did everyone who bought the last high. The last spike heavily influenced the social climate and perception, if that perception is negative you've got no buyers willing to buy the high, without them, you get no price spike.
@_date: 2018-10-01 23:13:34


If I tell you this hamburger is worth $40k, you're not any less of an idiot for only buying a tiny slice of it.


Each of those spikes was drived by new buyers rushing in, buying for stupid high prices, because they didn't know enough about what they were getting into and thought the bull run would last forever. Now that everyone and their grandma knows that bitcoin is a hilariously unstable asset that can completely fuck you over in a matter of minutes, you're still expecting to see that kind of behavior in the future?

no they fucking don't

Crony capitalism is just capitalism. Eventually one company rises to monopolize an industry and has the financial means to throw money at the bodies in charge of regulating them and their competition.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:22:18


Yeah, Comcast's strategy of monopolizing an industry, then repeatedly fucking over the consumer is so much fun, I want it to exist in every other area of life as well.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:46:26


lol is leaking

lol you must be bummed out r/incels got shut down
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:00:23


I've dealt with all those and across the board have had a better experience with them vs. dealing with corporate giants. Once you reach monopolization of an industry, there is little motivation to provide any sort of reasonable service to your customers, as long as you can price out your competition, which you can easily due to economy of scope and scale.


This isn't true at all.

yeah but now all the people are gone

@_date: 2018-11-21 17:28:01


That's not going to stop if from trickling away to nothing, as more and more people cut their losses as they realize it's just a get-rich-quick scam that the general public won't touch ever again.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:36:59


There is zero guarantee, or even and reason to suspect this is the case. You have latched onto bad information and have the same mindset as a compulsive gambler. You need to search out critical information if you don't want to destroy your life.

haha let me know when you find one school of economics that takes blockchain seriously
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:01:24


You're not wrong about sentiment being the greatest driver of the market, but that's definitely not the general sentiment haha.
Everybody and their mom watched themselves and all their friends go crazy about bitcoin for like a month, buy at the top, then get wrecked in the crash. Nobody thinks they're gonna be a millionaire anymore haha, they just know they're not getting anywhere near that shitty internet money.
There's a mexican standoff of the sliver of people who still think crypto is worth something. Everybody wants the price to go to the moon, but nobody's willing to lose money buying for higher than market price. You're only going to get completely uninformed buyers to do that, and the last batch of them is gone. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:55:07
if your "store of value" is constantly depreciating by every means of quantifying value that we have, then for all intents and purposes you have lost money. if literally the only metric you care about is the number of bitcoin you possess, then sure, otherwise, you've lost money, and could likely never get it back.
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:00:15


lol one of these things is not like the other
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:32:35
A bunch of cryptobro startups don't have anywhere near the resources needed to artificially prop up the value of the coins they rely on. If the market's collapsing, they can't do anything about it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:42:30
Because the vast majority of the population that you need to start buying bitcoin in order for the price to go up already saw bitcoin fuck over all their friends all year long and just don't give a shit about it anymore. Public perception of bitcoin is really poor right now outside of the small pockets on the internet that refuse to acknowledge reality. Without another huge influx of the general public, the price is just going to keep dropping.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:07:07
I bought a pallet of salamander shit that I'm holding on to. It takes up a lot of room and my neighbors can't leave the house because of the smell. It's definitely going to be worth millions next year because some kids on the internet told me.
You have no clue what the future will bring. If my lizard shit investment go to moon, what will you say then? Be prudent and shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:07:23
haha yes three papers with less than 100k downloads from a preprint paper repository is definitely what "the top students" are learning

this part is correct

This one video of a guy trying to give a horse a boner has 50x more views than the top SSRN article on bitcoin has downloads.


My grandma didn't know that bitcoin existed in 2015. Now she knows it's magic internet money that crashed and fucks people over. This last peak was a completely different scale.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:44:12
haha first it was the top top 10, now we're looking at the top 100?
there are churches that have more people show up on a sunday than most of those articles have downloads, and all from a repository that isn't even an academic journal.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:34:52
bitcoin = being able to run strip clubs. got it.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:49:40
your first two paragraphs are almost completely unintelligible enlish, so we'll just let that go.


literally everyone who is "HODL-ing", a gigantic percentage of bitcoin holders, have in every traditional sense lost value, as in, their held assets now have less buying power than the did previously.
you're really just saying that most people who hold bitcoin are stupid.
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:08:00
if you make a cartoon of it that means it will happen
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:13:49


Yeah, until the one peak when it ends up on the front page of the NYT and WSJ and everyone and their mom buys the ATH and gets completely fucked haha. Bitcoin peaks are fueled by uninformed, curious buyers trying to make a quick buck, and they're all gone now.

haha go introduce your neighbor to literally anybody as "my less intelligent friend" and let me know how that works out for you bud.
@_date: 2018-12-04 22:57:43
I'm suggesting if you're the kind of "friend" who has grouped a number of your friends into a "least intelligent" category, statistically speaking, you're dumb as fuck, as well as just being a gigantic asshole.
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:40:02
why don't you give this a read since the concept appears to be very foreign to you:

haha yeah you got me, arguments on the internet are totally what i base my self-confidence on.
y'all project like a motherfucker.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:46:19
yeah and if you said "i have a lower intelligence friend" again, across the board, you would be considered a giant asshole.
maybe step outside once in a while and talk to some people. it'll do you good to figure out how this shit all works.


haha i don't really base my self-worth off strangers on the internet who think it's cool to call their friends dumb but thanks.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:05:05

didn't get the memo that textspeak was banned by the internet police
LAUGH OUT LOUD
@_date: 2018-12-05 01:40:54


lol nobody said anything about refusing friendship.
if, in your head there exists two groups, your smart friends, and your dumb friends; if you do not hold the requisite level of social competence to look at individuals you care about as anything more than rungs on an intellectual ladder, you are an asshole and shit friend.




lmao srry, i didn't realize i was talking to a child
@_date: 2018-12-05 04:41:05
Oh you're right sorry. As long as you don't name your neighbor with down syndrome when you refer to him as your "less intelligent friend" everyone will be to tallying cool with it.
