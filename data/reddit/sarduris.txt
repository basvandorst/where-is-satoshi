Yes, it does.

**If I leave my BTC in Coinbase during the fork, will my BTC turn into the new version (BCC), or stay as the old version (BTC)?**




**Do I need to withdraw my BTC from Coinbase?**






**Will Coinbase eventually support withdrawals for Bitcoin Cash (BCC)?**


There appears to be some controversy surrounding this since a sizable portion of users experienced difficulties withdrawing their BTC.

Basically when it's worthless.

If you have the public address which you sent the BTC to, you can use [BitInfoCharts]( to browse the Bitcoin Cash blockchain (blocks, addresses, transactions); simply search for the public address in the search bar to see if there's any BCH in that particular address.
In regards to claiming your BCH, you can access your funds with your current private key(s) for the Bitcoin blockchain since all prior entries in the ledger before block 478559 are the same on *both* chains. However, this is only *if* you managed to send them to a wallet you control before the fork happened. You'll need a dedicated Bitcoin Cash wallet for this.


If it was in your Coinbase wallet during the fork you will not be able to retrieve it since they have chosen to support the original chain, basically keeping the forked coins to themselves.
I hope this clarifies things.
