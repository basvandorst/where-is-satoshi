Honestly this gives me so much confidence in Bitcoin and the blockchain. They're becoming afraid. I like

It depends. Are you interested in buying coins to sell off to make a quick buck? If your answer is yes then... maybe? One thing to consider is that nearly everyone who has invested in Bitcoin over the last year has lost money. With the end of the fiscal year coming a lot of people will be selling off the coin to deduct is as a loss. I expect the price will continue to decline or stay steady through December and could easily bounce back after the new year... The bottom line is unless you want to get all autistic on the blockchain and start writing trading algos then day to day trading of Bitcoin is only an exercise of masochism.
If you are interested in buying Bitcoin as a long term investor and you believe it will be BIG in the future then any price under $1000 is a good price. The market cap is $5bn right now, this sounds like a lot but for a currency this is tiny. I imagine this is the attitude of a majority of Bitcoin holders.

I believe blockchain technology is the future. Bitcoin may not be the form that it takes.
