This right here! Stories like yours are going to spread like wildfire in the coming years. "Early adopters hitting their so called "moons", getting out of debt, and investing in their families futures". I know most people won't get the opportunity you have when investing, but I have no doubt that the distribution of wealth in this country will shift more evenly, in part thanks to bitcoin. albeit I have no idea when that will happen but the more people that join in, the faster it will happen. Congrats, truly warmed my heart.

Every night this week. and all the time on my phone during the day...I may have a problem. I just cant stay away from those gains!

TRUE!! I do. It is just the most convenient for me for the recurring payments. I know the fees make my purchase around $9 but your right, anything is better than nothing. I also use a Electrum wallet, and do any real buy/selling on GDAX.
EDIT: more words.

That's awesome! It's so cool to see your money do work for you as opposed to the other way around. I started with around ≈200, and it's jumped up ≈50 bucks! it may be small but feels good,

im going ahead and skipping just telling my family, and I bought them some crypto greeting cards that function as a paper wallet as christmas gifts. Loaded each with $50 as of today, and wrote down the price and date. They will receive it, and I show them how since I got it the value has gone up (hopefully) by however much %, and that way they are already invested, and have seen it's potential value grow. The tricky part is getting them properly informed before they even think about touching the coins though.

Just bought $50 more. Every time I checked the price over this weekend I got more and more excited. eager to see how high we go from here.
