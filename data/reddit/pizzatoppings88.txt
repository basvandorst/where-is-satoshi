I made $3k profit instead of $10k profit. My entire portfolio was about $20k before the crash
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:37:51
You probably know better than most of us then. Yup the legal system has been pretty vague about the minute details. According to bitcoin.tax coin, coin transactions are not a taxable event. Coin for coin or coin for property or coin for services are taxable though 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:52
 I sold my core position. I see this hitting $11k. That’s when I’ll buy back in
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:15:13
I asked myself the same questions and immediately sold 80% of my stake. I only have 20% faith.
I actually used bitcoin for a couple weeks as my only currency. Fiat worked better by magnitudes more

It doesn’t matter, planned suicide is covered 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:35:46
It has fallen more than 40%. That has not been seen 300+ times, not even more than 5 times. This is a legit crash you can even say the bubble popped
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:17:26
That’s called a limit buy order. You just need to know how much you want to buy, and at what price. Those two pieces of info are all you need. You can do this on all exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:04:36
you are asking unrelated questions and commenting totally unrelated information. you're not wrong you're just branching out into completely different conversational topics. do you have autism?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:55:17
At that price literally the standard currency of the entire planet would have to be on bitcoin. If you think governments are going to allow that you are delusional. Which is good, you should invest your life savings into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:41:18
Depends what you mean by “fully.” I max out my 401k matching, my IRA contribution, and I have a six month emergency fund. 100% of all my income now goes into paying bills and buying bitcoin. To me this is being “fully in bitcoin”
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:24:28
Bitcoin is a shitty currency and gets shittier the more people congest the system. This bubble will pop eventually and the price will drop 90%. When? Impossible to predict. Hopefully after I sell what I have
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:20:24
It is an absolutely terrible payment technology right now
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:29:16
Yes it’s a scam
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:10:29
Smaller markets are actually easier to manipulate by large corporations. If JP Morgan decided to be unethical and go all in, for instance, they could use their media ties to propagate FUD about BTC. Then when the price is at a low, plop down 100 billion to buy ALL BTC on sale. Then they can use their media ties again to raise positive pr about bitcoin and sell at a tremendous profit. And unlike stocks which are regulated by the SEC, it would be easier to hide these kind of plays

you just don't understand what a fork is.
bitcoin is a database that is constantly growing. but some people didn't like the way it was being developed, so they COPIED (forked) the existing database and then made it their own. they called their new database "bitcoin cash."
now there are two databases that share the same data. but they are still two different databases, or chains. one is the bitcoin blockchain, and the other is the bitcoin cash blockchain. as long as you kept your old bitcoins (original database data) then it will have been copied into the new database (bitcoin cash). so you will have equal amounts of bitcoin and bitcoin cash
now the two chains are separate and doing their own thing. anything you do after the copy will happen in it's own respective chain. price fluctuates as perception of each chain changes
anyone is allowed to copy the existing bitcoin blockchain or whatever chain they want and make it their own. you could do it now. i could do it now. will it be valuable? no, unless you give people a reason to use it
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:33:47
that's true, but transaction fees have never skyrockets this high before
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:52
Sell your btc and transfer to your bank. Then pay income tax
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:57:17
You can download a bitcoin client on your PC to send/receive bitcoin. It will start off with zero balance. Then people can send you bitcoin at your address. As long as you have your password and private seed then your bitcoin is safe
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:18:29
Shady shit is happening with BTC too, you’re blinded by bias if you don’t see that but you see it in other coins
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:03:00
Using old paradigms? You mean like using basic math? And lol are you kidding me about gold? Just look at the gold ETFs, they are trading in the millions of transactions:  You are treating bitcoin, an asset, like a holy untouchable that is incomparable with anything in the world but that’s just stupid. That’s like saying airplanes can’t be compared with cars or that kindles can’t be compared with books. They are all assets that have markets, which respective market caps and transaction activity. Saying bitcoin market cap and transaction activity is somehow “different” and “incomparable” to other assets is idiotic
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:36:28
If Bitcoin is a terrible payment system why not just use a different store of value that is actually a good payment system as well? Bitcoin is not the only crypto anymore
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:25:39
It hit literally 14k for less than 10 seconds I Was actually trying to buy lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:50:23
So salty
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:00:36
That’s the optimistic way of looking at it. The pessimistic view is that the price is going up (even though the technology is getting worse to use) because of pure hype and hype only. If LN is not impactful, similarly to how SegWit has barely had any adoption, than the hype will dissolve and the price will collapse
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:39:33
Coinbase is escaping to the moon and taking all of our coins with them
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:19:02
Grateful that I lost $7k? nah that’s not how I roll
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:55:21
It hit $13.9k lol. I wish my bank was funded but it’s ok, hopefully it stays low next week
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:59:55
Tax laws are already established for bitcoin. It's considered property or taxable asset. At least in the US
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:02:54
Coin to coin transactions are not a taxable event according to bitcoin.tax so how you took the $180 is important. If you literally traded the bitcoin for litecoin then you don’t owe any tax but if you sold it for cash, and then bought litecoin with cash, then you do owe taxes for the gains made on the $180
You don’t owe taxes on the $160 since you’re still holding it
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:23:19
Yes I’m comparing digital assets to digital assets. Why are you comparing digital assets to hard physical goods, which can’t even be measured physically across the world? You seem to be terrible at comparing things, which is why you simply say bitcoin is incomparable with anything
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:20:35
The problem is that it might not be a correction. It might be the bubble popping
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:35:35
We do know that, because it’s been proven mathematically. These scaling issues with bitcoin were already known by the developers, they just couldn’t implement the upgrades in time. Both Dash and BCH foresaw these issues and already implemented their upgrades and have mathematically calculated the amount of scaling possible, and it dwarfs that of Bitcoin. Segwit is not a new thing
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:11:49
Price will collapse. People will either switch to a different crypto with better tech or avoid crypto altogether
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:51:58
The people who say it’s just “a promise” are haters. When you buy bitcoin from Coinbase you own it, just like how you own the dollars in your bank account. 
The only problem is that like a bank, if Coinbase as an entity fails and disappears then your bitcoin is also gone. Unlike a bank, however you will have zero protection. So there’s some merit to the hate for Coinbase.
If you’re willing to put in the effort to secure your own BTC, then do that. Otherwise letting Coinbase secure your bitcoin is the second best thing
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:31:21

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:35:24
The more I look at it the more it looks like OP is getting scammed. He should ignore anyone trying to get his personal info
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:31:03
Because transaction fees skyrocketed so hard that people suddenly woke up and realized that the technology was terrible
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:13:28
Just look at this thread to see why it’s a shirts currency
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:26:30
Back down to $14.4k . Looks like it might have stabilized between 14-15, we’ll see 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:19:06
Maybe. Decide if losing half of it is okay with you. If not, sell it now and walk away
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:03:19
Correct there is no way if they don’t support it
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:15:07
It is a shitty currency with a lot of potential, invest with caution
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:14:41
you can always leave the country and stop paying taxes. good luck finding somewhere else to live. it's in your freedom to do that. if you don't want to do that, then tough fucking luck. stay and pay taxes. you aren't entitled to jack shit, you useless piece of garbage
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:29
FUCK YES who else got in on this. It was literally &lt;5 min plummet. The time between 15k and 16k was like 10 seconds. Thank god for Coinbase alerts
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:01:07
It's a terrible idea to do market timing for traditional financial instruments like etfs. it's less of a bad idea, but still a pretty bad idea, for more volatile assets like stocks. for crypto? everything is super volatile anyways, anything you do is a crapshoot. market timing should be at least attempted by anybody with any idea of what's going on
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:54:55
You made a good decision. I wish I sold at $17k I would have $2k more profit right now. Oh well making money is still great
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:09:48
Equal amounts of both
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:51:37
I tried paying everyone in bitcoin too and it’s not worth it. At the very very best it is equal to paying with cash. But who pays with cash nowadays? I have credit cards that can literally give me 5% back on certain purchases. At the end of the year that’s thousands of dollars collected for free. That’s impossible with bitcoin. It doesn’t make sense fiscally to use bitcoin like this if you have good credit cards.
The next best thing is like I said, pay all bills in cash and use what is leftover to buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:43:09
Not true look at the transactions if you pay only $5 in network fees they are taking days to get processed if even that.
And credit cards for regular transactions are infinitely better right now. I have cards that literally give me up to 5% cash BACK, instead of fees like bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:17:21
Wrong. Spending bitcoin is equal to selling for fiat and then spending the fiat. If you gain more fiat then you spent for the bitcoin, that profit is taxable. Spending bitcoin is a taxable event
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:10:36

So salty
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:17:16
Lol you put Bitcoin on a pedestal as if people need to earn the right to invest in it. That’s not how investments work. Investments need to earn the right to have investors, not the other way around. Bitcoin as it is right now is a completely trash technology. The only hope for BTC right now is segwit adoption and lightning implementation, which aren’t guaranteed to be effective
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:45:09
I'm probably gonna get banned for saying this but this time it isn't just FUD. Coinbase is trading BCH now. People are starting to see the utility of BCH and are transferring at least part of their funds over. I know I am
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:41
I'm actually not too familiar, I like to use exchanges. But I know people have had success with this:

Then you’re fucked lol. Fix your bank transfer issue
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:49:00
You could have transferred it to GDAX and exchanged your BTC for LTC.
Anyways, you owe taxes on what you sold
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:57:22
We iota now
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:53:43
Bitcoin is a property. You get taxed based off the increase of value from the property you own when you sell it or exchange it for anything else
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:06:56
Yup if public perception of bitcoin changes so that it is viewed as useless technology (which it almost is right now) then the price will collapse 90%+ overnight. It needs to be developed further and actually be used by people and companies

There is always uncertainty. It pays to be safe sometimes. You could have not paid off your mortgage and your 14650 per coin would be worth more now. But you did the safe thing and paid off your mortgage. That’s a good decision, such as not buying at ATH lol. This is a volatile asset, setting limits to not buy at ATH works almost all the time. I have been buying constantly and I have never bought at any ATHs
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:12:06
I get sad when it goes up, because I should have bought more. Then I get sad when it goes down, because my value went down. Either way I’m just hoping the bubble won’t pop until I’ve exited

@_date: 2017-12-17 18:49:34
Providing criticism is not bashing. Criticism actually does add to the conversation. Yelling hodl and blindly saying bitcoin is going to hit $50k price is not adding to the conversation. Sorry you are butt hurt but the fact is that bitcoin is a terrible technology right now and if there is no improvement there will be a massive plunge in price. I have $20k invested and yes I’m part of the 21 million club so I’m not just bashing for no reason. Doesn’t matter how many users there are now, if it’s a shit technology people will stop using and investing in it. And it is definitely a shit technology right now
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:20
And there it is, $11k
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:38:24
It all depends on how much risk you’re willing to take. I like Coinbase too but I try not to hold more than $1.5k worth with them at any given time
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:08:56


@_date: 2017-12-22 03:44:34

yes during a major transition state there will be FUD which effects all coins
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:18

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:51:24
Of course you disagree lol. You’re mind gaming yourself due to your bias. He essentially saved himself from an almost 20% drop; that would obviously be advisable in any scenario
Even in your example, 12k profit doesn’t mean he has to buy back in at 12k. That’s PROFIT. He would be at a new baseline
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:40:11

@_date: 2017-12-21 17:34:29
what do you mean, there will definitely be an effect on btc coin demand. from an investment standpoint why would you want to go through the hassle of buying crypto from an exchange and managing the security of wallets, etc etc, when you can just buy/sell securities that track the crypto value the exact same way? the only thing you lose out on is spending the crypto but transaction fees prevent that anyways. getting a security is less work, less risk, with the same outcome
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:53:27
All correct
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:55:20
Yea so what? They are both tradable assets. Apples and oranges are different too but they are both fruit 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:55:42

@_date: 2017-12-19 22:31:02
How much did you lose?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:25:16
You don’t know that. It’s not done dropping, it could drop to 10k

Interesting I have a paper wallet how can I tell what I have and how do I upgrade?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:48
Right now it’s taxed as an asset. So similar to stocks but also real estate. You pay tax whenever you sell for fiat or when you exchange it for any other good (like buying pizza)
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:08:05
You must be pretty salty if you’re commenting on a two month old comment. Within the last two months bitcoin has spiked tremendously 
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:54:02
dude you are totally not getting his point. he's saying that our taxes are being misused, and in a way it would make sense to not pay taxes as a form of protest. realistically of course this is not an option. 
nowhere is he saying that we should stop using taxes for social services
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:36:46
You've got no choice then other than buying from strangers. Which even then may not be possible because you will need some sort of payment like venmo, paypal, or quickpay
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:28:42
Oh really? Have you tried or are you just bullshitting? Because I transferred money to my girlfriend in Paris and even Western Union worked better than Bitcoin, let alone a bank wire. I wired money to a venue this week and it was faster and cheaper than Bitcoin now
This is all ignoring the fact that most people don’t even do international bank transfers. If that’s the only good thing about the currency then it is a shit currency
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:36:06
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:51
because i'm still invested short term. duh. i exchanged $2k worth to BCH today already though. and this is not FUD, it's fact
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:35:15
Eth is pretty promising
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:02:35
Yes much worse because China is only one country, the rest of the world could still use bitcoin without a problem.
The tx fees are so high right now that btc is not use-able in the ENTIRE WORLD. Much much much worse right now

“Just needs adoption” you say it like this is a minor step. The fact that there isn’t mass adoption is a bad sign
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:34:14
I will definitely sell. The only question is when...
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:29:54
What is bitcoin? A currency technology. Is it a good one? No. If you actually used it you would see it’s the simple fact and truth right now. High transaction fees and slow speed is now how a currency succeeds. Plug in OP’s public address into the blockchain. He’s not exaggerating. $50 transaction with a $2 fee taking multiple days to process and still not succeeding is not a good technology 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:53:27
Because OP sounds like a retard? I agree
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:55:01
Depends what you mean by large transactions. If you are selling bitcoin then any gains you’ve made will fall under capital gains tax

You and entirely over thinking this. It’s actually very simple. Large market cap, large number of transactions. If there aren’t a large number of transactions, then people are holding and not transacting. It’s extremely basic. Treating crypto like some kind of otherworldly asset is not realistic. Crypto is an asset like how any other tradeable item is an asset. You’re putting crypto on a pedestal because you are blinded by your bias

This is 100% false and shows how biased you are. There are absolutely tons of times in bitcoin history where it was worth TONS less than 12 months before. If anything it's only been spiking over the last 2 years. It really only takes about 10 seconds of research:  And yes it can happen again

@_date: 2017-08-16 22:57:17
During the last fork I wanted separate wallets for btc and bch and to do that I had to import my paper wallet (private key) into an exchange before sending the amounts to two new secure paper wallets.
There's no way the average person would have been able to do that with no research lol.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:24:16
Okay so you don't know what zero means. It means NONE. When you say a person needs ZERO technical knowledge that means they won't even know what bitcoin is.
Anybody can go into a bank and open a checking account with zero financial knowledge. Can you do that with bitcoin? No. You can't do shit unless you do research. You're extremely biased and like I said, you have an extremely bad understanding of how the world works and how people live their lives. 
I literally did not know what a bitcoin was and had to do research. Many people will be starting from the same place. Very few people will be able to actually do what I did. You don't think this is true because like I said, you have a very poor understanding of people
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:03:01
So these are the weaknesses he pointed out:
1. **Someone could hack the blockchain** - so this sentence is just straight up wrong, but based on his source he meant that EXCHANGES could be hacked. Which is true. Tons of exchanges have been hacked. Even the most reputable ones right now like Coinbase have a bad reputation (although are getting much much better). The only ways to keep your coins absolutely safe require technical skills, which most people don't have.
2. **Groups of users can place large buys and sells of Bitcoins, manipulating their value** - this is true. We see this happen with other financial instruments like equities.
3. **Bitcoin users could simply start using other crypto-currencies** - this is also true. Bitcoin is very successful for what it is, but don't pretend that it isn't deathproof. Go to the eth or ltc subreddits and you'll see the same kind of passion for those coins as you see in this sub.
These are real risks that prevent people like me from just putting my life savings in bitcoin. I don't think he'll regret anything, this was a pretty good article for non-technical people
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:58:20
This is so incredible. Having one of the largest investment institutions in the US give its support to cryptocurrency proves its legitimacy to such a huge degree. People like me entrust a good portion of our entire life savings into Fidelity, including 401ks, IRAs, equity holdings, etc. I can already see people on Twitter asking what a digital wallet is, and trying to figure out why Fidelity would want to support it! Again, incredible!
It's interesting that they decided to partner up with Coinbase. This gives Coinbase a lot of clout as well: 


@_date: 2017-08-04 02:07:52
except cryptos aren't classified as securities. you wouldn't want that to happen anyways
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:07:48
If you think it takes zero technical skills you should go answer all the newcomer questions:  There are many. Or even better yet, explain to me why so many people have questions in the first place, if it takes zero technical skills?
Like I said, you have an extremely poor understanding of how people and the world works. Maybe go outside of your box and see what kind of people exist
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:37:16
[Which is also wrong.](
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:19:13
Okay so you just admitted that it requires research to use Bitcoin. So that's already more than zero technical knowledge needed. Do you not know what the number zero means?
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:34:34


Your words, not mine
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:56:58
Lol...if you work in tech you know it's a lot more likely than that. Ever heard of heartbleed? That was a security flaw found in SSL certificates, like LAST YEAR. People were broken for YEARS and who knows how many black hats took advantage. The entire world was dark on this, including the world's best security and network minds. Nobody knew for years.
If just one thing like that broke in the news about bitcoin, it could hit .00000001 or essentially zero

If you sent btc to the incorrect address and it has been confirmed then it's gone forever
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:58:08
Hey dude below are the steps to split a bitcoin paper wallet into separate BTC and BCH wallets:
1. Have a paper bitcoin wallet before the split (this will be your legacy bitcoin paper wallet).
2. After the split, your paper bitcoin wallet will have two sets of coins: BTC and BCH. You can see your BTC balance by using a BTC explorer (I like [blockchain]( You can see your BCH balance by using something like [blockchair](
**Make a new BTC Wallet**
3. Go to a reputable exchange (I used blockchain) and import your legacy paper wallet using your private key.
4. Go to [bitaddress]( to create a new paper wallet that will ONLY hold bitcoin
5. Using your bitcoin exchange to send all of your bitcoin to your new bitcoin paper wallet.
**Make a new BCH Wallet**
6. Download [electron cash](
7. Import your legacy bitcoin cash paper wallet (from step 1) using your private key
8. Go to [bitaddress]( to create a new paper wallet that will ONLY hold bitcoin cash
9. Use electron cash to send all your bitcoin cash to your new bitcoin cash paper wallet
Your legacy bitcoin wallet should now be empty. Don't use it anymore, it has been compromised by being imported into an exchange. You should have two new paper wallets: one that only has bitcoin, and one that only has bitcoin cash.

@_date: 2017-08-16 17:44:18
Anyone who works in IT can tell you that creating a paper wallet, importing private wallets to an exchange, and managing private keys are not something that most people can handle. There's a reason why so many guides exist, because so many people are clueless. I'm literally an IT professional with a six figure salary and it took me hours to get everything understood and sorted out. You have an extremely poor understanding of people and how the world works if you think it takes zero technical skills to keep bitcoin safe
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:44:20
First of all most people don't even know what an Electrum wallet is. Let alone: 
- public address
- private seed
- hardware wallet
- encryption
- QR code
Like I said, takes much more than zero knowledge (which you said). I'm done trying to teach you, you are too stubborn to acknowledge facts. There's a reason why I make a good living, it's because people are not tech savvy. If you're just going to ignore that part of reality, well, that's your failure

Bitcoin is hardly low risk. Past performance is never an indicator of future gains, that’s investment 101. As something that has grown over 600% recently, people should be wary not more bullish. BTC value is behaving exactly like a bubble, and all this newfound  hype, even with no major improvements/adoption, only confirms that. Every bubble that has ever popped was filled by get rich quick investors who valued the asset based on past performance instead of fundamentals. At this point almost all investors are speculators, so if it popped tomorrow only the diehard believers would be surprised. So yes, obviously it is more safe to ensure a roof over your head instead of spending the majority of it on an extremely volatile asset

Like I already said, this entire thread is about the safest option. So yes, you have been arguing that buying bitcoin instead of a house is the safest option when it clearly is not.
Fiat will depreciate but real estate has been a relatively good investment for a while now. Bitcoin has been acting like a bubble for a while now. Bubbles sometimes take years to pop, look at the dot com and real estate bubbles. Not all bubbles are like the Tulip one. I believe in bitcoin but I’m realistic enough to know that there’s a good deal of risk
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:13:47

Erm well you need to spend something to survive right? Or else how do you buy food? The fact that you are using a different currency to buy food shows that it is a better currency. OP is right on the money, BTC is pure speculative asset right now, people don’t want to spend it they just want to HODL and see it increase in value 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:52:08
Fyi if you have a USD balance you can transfer it to GDAX, the associated Coinbase exchange. They offer 0.25% fee limit buys which for you would have been about $0.25. Then you can transfer your purchased BTC back to Coinbase

You can switch to bitcoin as your primary form of currency right now. Why does it matter what form of currency is deducted from your net worth? There’s no difference between you 1) spending bitcoin and 2) converting bitcoin to cash and then spending it. Either way, you will have spent it. 
Just pay your landlord in whatever currency he wants, pay your other bills in whatever currency is the most convenient, and then convert 100% of what is leftover into bitcoin. This is dedication to the currency. I’ve been doing it for about two months now and it’s been working quite well

Wow you are so stupid. Go learn reading comprehension. It was an analogy to show you how important smp 500 is compared to bitcoin. You said bitcoin is worth more than smp 500, even went on to say more than 400/500 companies. You even said it's worth more than ALL BANKS. Those statements are mathematically false. Bitcoin is worth nowhere NEAR 15 trillion, not even 4/5 of 15 trillion. You're fucking **RETARDED** lol
Go get me a source showing how bitcoin is worth more than the smp500 you fool

@_date: 2017-10-18 21:54:16
Yes unfortunately for non-technical people like you it will be more difficult. You'll have to wait until BTC gets more widespread acceptance before going in.
Otherwise you can spend time and energy researching how to create a paper wallet, have people send you BTC, managing BTC wallets, buy BTC on exchanges, etc

Lol why choose gold per oz? Why not ton? Why not planetful? That unit of measurement makes no sense. If you really want to measure how gold compares to btc you can look at the market cap. Even at 80 billion that is absolutely nothing compared to the gold market. I already gave you the numbers. Let me do the math for you: 80000000000/7,792,262,494,638 = .0102. 
Bitcoin makes up about ONE PERCENT of Gold lol. What is this bullshit you're saying where btc is worth more than gold again? BTC would literally have to increase value by 100x just to match gold

I mean yea Exchanges are not banks, so of course you can't withdraw 10 million, unless that's how much people just so happen to be storing in the Exchange doing nothing. Exchanges make their money through fees and interest. They are not supposed to have cash reserves or assets, because again, they are not a bank. Their job is to facilitate people buying and selling to each other. Whoever wrote that has no idea how exchanges work
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:15:35

@_date: 2017-09-18 21:11:29
You shouldn't HODL either if you believe in the project, that's just another get rich scheme, just not quick. If you actually believe in bitcoin you should be looking for ways to actually use it in your every day life. If you're not interested in using bitcoin to buy groceries or gas then you're just another speculator
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:28:14
He was joking. In reality your wallet (if you own the private key) will have TWO amounts. One in btc and the other the new currency. You will have to use a different block chain explorer to actually see the new currency. Also You'll have to create another wallet to split the two

Very good points. It'll be interesting to see what Coinbase ultimately decides
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:23:03
$1000 worth, that's all I can afford for now. It might fall further, it might not. But in my opinion the best time to buy is during a major crash, rather than during a major spike. If I had $7k not doing anything I would just go all in and then not look at it for a couple months
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:35:25
Dude you're not getting it. A paper wallet ONLY EXISTS as a piece of paper with information printed on it. If you are sweeping, clicking any buttons, using any bitcoin, selling, transferring, or using it at ALL on any computer or mobile device then it is NOT a paper wallet. What you are using is not a paper wallet. There are no buttons to press for paper wallets. Paper wallets do not exist in a digital form that you can use. You can view the amount in the blockchain explorer and THAT'S IT. Once you import it into a computer or mobile device then your paper wallet is compromised and is no longer a paper wallet. There is no button to push. You might be completely incompetent and unable to understand this. This is my last time trying to explain this to you.
Here is how to create a paper wallet: 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:37:40
Well for one there are a ton of s&amp;p 500 companies that aren't banks. And for two those companies are literally worth many multiple times the value of all bitcoins, in many billions. If bitcoin disappeared tomorrow the US would be fine. If the s&amp;p 500 companies disappeared tomorrow, there would be no US soon after.
Anyone who says that bitcoin is worth more than most of s&amp;p 500 is seriously fucking retarded
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:53:49
It's easier just to use shiftcoin + Coinbase for everything

Your fiat money is not backed by anything. Does that mean that when you buy something with cash you are not buying anything? Or that you are giving nothing for something? Of course not. You're buying a good with cash. You're giving something to get something. Same thing. 
The underlying systems don't matter if the result is that a good is being purchased. 
It doesn't matter if my dollars are being sent to Coinbase or not because at the end of the day I bought bitcoin and then used it to buy a good. My entire purchase would not have been possible unless I had bought bitcoin that Coinbase owns, even if it's a representative good

Well this just goes to show that you can never time the market. I regretted not buying at $3k, then I regretted buying at $4k, now I'm regretting not buying at $3.5k.
It's easier just to accept that the market is not timeable and buy on a fixed schedule. I'll just keep buying $100 worth of crypto every Friday until I hit a full bitcoin and then decide whether to invest even more or not
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:15:53
Coinbase makes it easy to actually spend bitcoin (remember it's currency, you should want to spend it), and it's integrated with multiple financial institutions that allow for meaningful tracking and financial goal management.
Yea you can put your coins in an offline paper wallet and that would be safe, but then you can't sell or use it
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:55:21
Because for bitcoin to be worth that much then existing currencies would lose tremendous value. And when that happens then governments collapse. It has happened many times before, look at Brazil, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Roman Empire, etc

lol i did my research i just pulled my source from a 1 year old article. where is your source? bitcoin has literally never matched even close to a magnitude of the gold market. you're an idiot for believing something with NO knowledge. like i said, use BASIC division. if you can't even do that, well like i said keep dreaming about your lambo lol. 
your knowledge is not based on any real world information other than "oh it happened in the past so it will keep happening over and over again" lol. banks and governments aren't even CLOSE to shitting their pants lol. in fact jp morgan bought bitcoin themselves, because they are able to diversify. they don't give a fuck. you just think that they're scared because you read clickbait articles like "bitcoin is worth more than gold" and "banks are scared of bitcoin" and you believe it all without hesitation. you don't even spend a single iota of brainpower to maybe use some critical thinking, like "worth WHAT unit of gold" or "WHY banks are scared". that's all bs pushed by pumpers and you fall for it head over heals and now you think crypto is worth more than the ENTIRE GOLD MARKET lol
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:21:11
Yea possible
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:49:08

Coinbase is pretty much a bank though. It's a BTC bank. People call it an exchange but it really isn't. GDAX is an exchange owned by Coinbase, so they have an exchange, but they are not one. If you put USD in Coinbase it is even FDIC insured up to $250k, that's as close to a bank as you can get
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:56:39
Since you have used Xapo, you should probably consider Coinbase + Shift. You store your bitcoin into Coinbase and then you use the Shift Debit card to purchase things. Coinbase will sell the correct amount of bitcoin and pay Shift for your purchases. There are no transaction or network fees. Looks to be very similar to Xapo. I've been using it as my primary form of spending for a month now and it's pretty awesome

to be honest governments don't even need to ban them. they can just straight up control them. just look at the latest 2x fork. if that happens, that will be the biggest hit to decentralization since the inception of bitcoin, and gives governments the key to possibly even centralize bitcoin
like i said, governments have access to money and power. thinking that bitcoin is powerful enough to defeat governments, which are run by groups of people more intelligent than you or me, is naive as hell
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:37:56
Shift Card is a third party company that links to your Coinbase account. As long as you have bitcoin in your Coinbase account then then you can use it for debit card purchases.
The MOST incredible thing about it for now is that there are NO transaction or network fees. This is probably due to some partnership between Coinbase and Shift. I don't know if it will last forever but it's incredible for right now
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:58:15
Like I already pointed out, your strategy for attaining bitcoin through the easiest possible methods may fail if you don't have the technical skills to work with wallets. And I'm not going to teach you. Do the research yourself
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:46:50
yup, it will error out if you put it above market unfortunately. you must put it below the market price.
you can always put it at like 99% of the market price though. Regular fluctuation will trigger it. That's worked for me almost all the time, but i did have to wait a couple hours once. I usually put it at $.01 below the market price. If you put $.50 it may not ever trigger within your personal time frame

Unfortunately using bitcoin on the chain is too expensive. Even if they accept it, if the item is cheap you can expect to pay an extra 20%+ just to pay the network fees. When you account for the opportunity cost from using credit cards, which for me can be 5% cash back for certain items, it just doesn't make sense to transact directly on the chain right now.
One day merchants will eat the cost of network fees like they do for credit card fees, and when that happens we can all start doing transactions on the chain instead of using middle men like Shift. That's the dream.
But that won't happen until bitcoin is accepted by society as a whole. And that won't happen if everyone just tries to HODL and pray that it goes to the moon.
HODLing is better than nothing, in that you are participating a little, but that makes you just a speculator. If you really believe in btc you'll want to actually use it. That's the purpose of cryptocurrency
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:05:03

@_date: 2017-09-25 16:36:59
Coinbase is mostly a wallet service. they do let you buy and sell bitcoin, but they charge you a pretty hefty 1.25% per transaction. 
The Coinbase company actually owns an exchange called GDAX. They are fully integrated. You can transfer your Coinbase balances to GDAX and vice versa. Once you have funds in GDAX you can do standard exchange market and limit buys. The fees for GDAX are also much much lower than Coinbase, about 0.25% per transaction, so you should stop using Coinbase to buy crypto
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:35:41
I am not. You're asking me why I'm not using fiat to buy the energy drink. Well, I'm asking you why do you still have fiat at all? You can just use bitcoin to buy everything. Why do you use an inflationary currency at all when you can primarily use bitcoin?
Sorry if I'm blowing your mind but that's the ENTIRE purpose of this thread
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:46:12
On chain is too expensive with the network fees. It literally turns a $5 purchase into $6.20, an insane 24% increase. And almost no merchants IRL accept it at this point. There's just no financial incentive to spent btc in that way at this time. The shift card solves both of those problems. I don't see how it is gimmicky for people who want to transition to BTC as their primary form of spending 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:51:00

You can buy BTC for only 0.25% fee, but you will have to wait a while and do a little extra work. 
1. Open a Coinbase account and input your bank information. 
2. Start a bank transfer. 
3. Wait 3-5 business days.
4. The money will be removed from your bank account to Coinbase for free.
5. Log into GDAX (created automatically with Coinbase).
6. Click "Withdraw" and withdraw your money from your Coinbase account into GDAX.
7. Click "Limit" and set a limit buy for bitcoin.
8. When it triggers you'll pay 0.25% fee.
9. You now have bitcoin in your GDAX account.
According to [here]( Coinbase is supported in Denmark

Imaging if you had a us dollar. If the us dollar forked, then the government would give you ANOTHER us dollar, which you can call "us dollar type b," and the old us dollar "type a." You will have two different us dollars, one old and one new. Some stores will accept type b, while others will accept type a. One will probably be worth more than the other.
That's what's happening with bitcoin on Oct 25. The original bitcoin will still be called bitcoin, while the "new" bitcoin will be called "bitcoin gold." Which one will be worth more in the long run? That's what we're waiting to see
@_date: 2017-10-03 17:35:06

I actually believe in bitcoin so I don't just buy it for speculation. When I get my paycheck I pay rent and then use 100% of the leftovers to buy bitcoin. Then I use my Shift debit card to pay for my daily things using bitcoin. Any leftover unspent bitcoin will appreciate or depreciate depending on the markets. I started doing this about a month ago and I've already made 20% gains
Bitcoin is already a usable currency. I would say it is relatively stable (in that I'm pretty confident it won't depreciate in the long run)
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:26:27
Right now I see it as a shitty currency that's hard to use and isn't accepted in most places.

I can agree with this, which is why bitcoin will never hit $500k or even $350k within our lifetimes (MAYBE if we account for fiat inflation). Governments will fight it to the point of collapse rather than adopting bitcoin as the standard. There will be an equilibrium where both fiat and crypto will both be used

Nobody set a rule that bitcoin had to be used on-chain. People and the markets will eventually use bitcoin however they see is the most useful. Like Venmo, Paypal, and Bank transfers, there are tons of digital currencies being transacted all the time without people directly handing physical cash into another person's hand. I don't see why there's so much hate for third parties on although I can understand the distrust since incidents like Mt. Gox.
With companies like Coinbase and Shift handling all transactions on their side, there are no network fees, and I have used bitcoin multiple times to buy coffee, food, and other services. I know I sound like a shill but hopefully there are more companies that step up to compete with Coinbase, so that there are more daily users of bitcoin. Imagine if Chase started a Quickpay service that only used bitcoin. That would be incredible.
About a month ago I transitioned to converting 100% of my post-living income to bitcoin and I've already seen a significant gain in my accounts, and the risk is mitigated with my regular daily spending. If I wanted to I could further mitigate my risk by moving a portion of my bitcoin to a paper wallet, but I'll consider that once I hit 1 full bitcoin (which should be soon!)

I did the math earlier and it would match gold at around 350k. lol you're crazy if you think the entire crypto will be worth more than the entire gold. The entire world would have to be on a bitcoin standard. Yes, possible, but governments would have to fall before that happens
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:50:17
It depends on how busy the network is. Right now the median network fee for all BTC transactions is 0.0002938 BTC or $1.30. So if you buy a $5 item that's more than 20% in fees. My first online BTC purchase was for $5 and I paid about that in network fees
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:43:03
he's already dumb enough to think that bitcoin is going to hit $500k within the next 100 years, what did you expect. i mean, i like bitcoin too but btc would have to be like the official galaxial currency (after we have colonized other planets) to be valued that much
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:48:02
Third party / off chain transactions are the only way this will work currently and for the foreseeable future. The lightning network is purely theoretical right now. Coinbase already allows free member-to-member transactions and when partnered with Shift allows bitcoin to be spent with real life merchants with zero fees. You do sacrifice total control but in return you get free and instant transactions

This makes no sense if you have any understanding of the gold and bitcoin markets. The bitcoin market cap is still like 1% of the gold market cap. Which means bitcoin as a whole is worth 1% of gold. Just because one bitcoin is worth more than one oz of gold doesn't mean jack. That's like saying one 100 dollar bill is worth more than one 5 dollar bill. So what? You can get twenty one 5 dollar bills. They are different stores of value.
Another good example would be saying that since one share of Berkshire is worth more than one share of Apple, then Berkshire must be worth more than Apple. No. Apple is still worth more than Berkshire even if one share of it costs less.

The table itself will not be able to exist as time passes. Table is made out of wood which is made out of organic material, which breaks down as time passes
The rock sitting on your table will fall off as the table breaks down. The building surrounding the rock will crumble to dust as time continues. Then the rock will be open to the weather, which means wind and rain. Rocks break down to wind and rain over time. IE erosion.
Your example fails. And this is all ignoring the basic knowledge that eventually our sun will go through heat death, destroying the entire planet and everything on it

It's impossible to know if it will go up or down in the short term. So help yourself by realizing that, and stop thinking about it.
Now, do you think bitcoin is going to be going up in the long term? If so, buy today. It won't matter if it goes up or down in the short term if you are holding for the long term anyways.
If it makes you feel better you can also dollar cost average, which is when you split up your purchase over a longer period of time. If you have $2k to spend for example you can spread it over one month, and make $500 purchases. That way if the price drops suddenly you won't get the full affect

I know people who have used taxis in Italy before Uber existed and I have heard nothing but bad experiences. Nothing but assholes that try to scam as much money from you as possible. In the US it's the same. I used to ride 2-3 taxis a week for work and I've been scammed who knows how many times. Overcharging me, or telling me that I had to pay in cash was extremely common. When Uber came out my life literally improved a significant amount because now I don't have to deal with fucking asshole taxi drivers. I have avoided taxis like the plague ever since.

A 3rd party owns funds that I use to my discretion, same as any other source of currency that exists today. Same as a bank. Do you use a bank? Yes you can withdraw, but until you have the cash in hand then in dollar terms it's not yours. The bank will even invest and make money off of whatever you put into their accounts. If the bank goes bust, bye bye dollars! Same shit. So no, it's not true that I don't own bitcoin relative in the way currency is used today.

I'm not sure that there are actually any BTC transactions. Coinbase definitely takes away an equivalent value of BTC from your account and then sends fiat to Shift. However, I don't know if Coinbase actually uses an on-chain transaction to sell BTC or just debits out the bitcoin/fiat from their own accounts appropriately. It's possible that Coinbase has all the BTC and fiat in appropriate funds available to make all these transactions off-chain, which is why we don't pay any tx fees.
Either way it works so whatever. If I had to pay tx fees I wouldn't be using the card at all

In the US bitcoin is considered an asset, not a currency. So when you use it to buy anything, like a sandwich, then you are technically "selling" bitcoin and then buying the sandwich with dollars. Any profit that exists between you buying the bitcoin and "selling" it is considered profit and thus taxable.
The good thing is that nowadays it's pretty easy to pay taxes on your bitcoin gains. I'm using bitcoin as my primary currency right now to buy things, and when it comes time to pay taxes I'll be able to use the [Coinbase tax cost basis report]( to report my gains. If you don't use Coinbase [there are free bitcoin tax services]( that do the same thing. It doesn't take long at all so it's worth it IMO.

If they get into themselves I'll be the first to give positive reinforcement but actually going out and converting the cash of your family into bitcoin firmly places the blame in your hands.
Hopefully your dad is just playing along with you and threw in some side cash just to have something in common with you, in which case it won't matter if BTC drops or not

Yes if you want to transfer for free, it takes about a week. Wallets are used to hold or spend BTC. Exchanges are used to sell/buy BTC. Exchange accounts can hold BTC, but are not wallets. Once you buy BTC from an Exchange you can just let it sit, transfer to a wallet, or sell. You cannot spend the BTC until you transfer it to a wallet

I never said JP Morgan used their own name to buy bitcoin. They have backed bitcoin ETNs, that shit is old news already. Look it up yourself.
I also never said that you said that bitcoin has already hit the market cap of gold. Quote me where I said that. You're the one who can't read. You're the one saying that "bitcoin is worth more than gold" like a damn retard lol. I can actually quote you on the otherhand. You LITERALLY said this idiotic thing:


LOL! Which is not surprising because you're so stupid that you just admitted to not caring about the numbers. Which further proves that you just pulled the $500k number out of your ass like a retard. I already proved to you mathematically that the only way that is possible would be for the entire Bitcoin market to surpass the entire gold market. So either you believe that the entire Bitcoin market will surpass the entire gold market (i.e. you are retarded), or you are just ignoring the mathetmatical facts (i.e. you are retarded). Either way you are retarded.

Why do you even have fiat at all if you can just buy bitcoin with it?

Gdax buys are 0.25% if you use limit buys. I don't know anywhere that is cheaper than that

Damn the average book costs $32? Must be all those ripoff college textbooks raising the average

Yup, Coinbase handles that. Apparently I "profited" off my energy drink by about 20 cents. And if you don't want to use Coinbase there are other tools available online that will do it for you pretty easily

Well if he has ownership of a horse dick then that's his dick and he should eat it. It's nobody else's dick, it's his own dick, and he made a bet on a dick of his ownership
