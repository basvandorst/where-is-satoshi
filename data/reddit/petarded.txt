We're a direct but lovable fun bunch.

American nerd checking in.  This would be totally awkward and confrontational this side of the Atlantic.
@_date: 2014-02-19 22:13:48
Aww damn. I was just there an hour ago. Guess I'll check it out tomorrow.

I was honestly just kidding.
Grew up in Boston and I have zero problem telling someone trying to rip me off to fuck off.

I was happy when I reached $3.14.
Living the dream.

Pretty uneventful Friday for me, with nothing really out of the ordinary happening.  One could say things are going pretty damn smooth.

Nope.  Doesn't matter to me, it's just what I know at the moment so if you needed help I would at least know the interface you're looking at.

I started using [this spreadsheet]( I found in a bitcointalk forum.  Once I made a few small changes it works perfectly.  Just add a new line every time you make a purchase and it calculates everything.
It's not pretty but it gets the job done.  Maybe when my semester quiets down I'll make my own pretty version, but for now this works.
edit:  Just to clarify I didn't make this so therefore I am not $40,000 richer.  In fact with student loans it is the complete opposite.

Get an address at [Coinbase]( (no affiliation, it's just what I use) and give it to me.  Once I have your address I'll send you the moolah.

All set, let me know if you got it ok.

Thanks for the free bitcoin!  This will be my first experience in the bitcoin world.

I could send you $.50 to get you started.  I don't have much more to give, but it will wet your toes a little.  It's always fun seeing a bit of your money fluctuate.
Let me know.
edit:  A screw it, I'll give ya a buck.
