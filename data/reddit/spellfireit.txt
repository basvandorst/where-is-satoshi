I think some Italian information will help to understand better the context.
If the settlement was in 1996 probably the procedings started in 1995 and it's referring to 1000 "Windows" probably sold in the previous years. So year should be 1994  (windows 3.1 or 3.11) 
At that time computers shops (wich is probably the activity of the company involved) sold PC with OEM installed and I know no one buying a PC at that time with regular Windows  license  (and yes it was illegal to do so)
Good shops would tell you something like  "IF you want windows I can install it for free but... it will be an illegal copy "
Scammers would make you pay  for additional windows without telling you it's a pirated copy
When Italy adopted Euro the rate exchange was fixed to 1 Euro=1936.27 Lire.
There were daylight shops in Italy whose activity was "selling copies of pirated software" since internet was possible mainly  from few universities in 1994 those shops were our TOrrents' sites

A good wallet can be Breadwallet, I use samourai on android. If you use any wallet that lets you keep your keys you are fine.
I am not a daytrader so any exchange is as good as the other. Coinbase isn't bad, if possible I would avoid exchanges that uses  Tether.
Stay away from Bitcoin.com Wallet, the owner already declared he will devolve almost all resources he have on His Project (an Alt COin forked from Bitcoin)

It's called arbitrage.
There are a lot of traders doing it usually with bots.
1st Problem is the time between the movement of btc (that most of the times is much longer than confirmation time)  or tether from and to the exchange you want (You may be in the situation where the price  on the exchange change so much that you lost money selling or buying)
2nd problem is Tether, if you use it... the company that distribute it writes plain and simple that 1 usd Tether can't be considered as 1 USD.
3rd problem All this would work if your exchanges works properly, usually the price is so different because 1 of the 2 exchanges has velocity problems..
But as I said lot of people are doing it and profiting

Sadly it's not like you describe in many Countries.
For example you can't even pass the border between an european nation and another with more than 10k EUro without declaring it (and pay taxes if that nation say so)
Snoop dogg got a fine for that reason comng to Italy a couple of years ago.

I would like that approach but NO indication of that till now.
You are assuming good faith and logical thinking even if the attitude of the same companies towards the hard fork was opposite (they committed a hard protocol change that would affect everyone in few months time with few developers on it which would have resulted in a OFF BY ONE BUG)
smaller companies have switched to Segwit with less resources (yes,they have less usesrs so it's more easy though) without any problems.
You givr them the benefit of the doubt even if everything points to the opposite.

Warning, what you are describing is considered money laundry almost everywhere in the world.
Keep in mind that all the scheme has a double conversion fee. You convert from fiat to BTC and pay a "rate fee" (localbitcoins it's medium 7% usually)and a  rate fee when you use atm (check your atm for knowing how much)
Also banks have conversion fees so be sure to calculate that too.
Your anonimity stops when you meet someone from localbitcoins, taht amount of money will be soon noticed.
If you are able you should just do it in a legal way

I think an Exchange should enforce itself a "Proof of Ownership".
The Exchange could move all Bitcoins (or 90% to allow users normal operation) in 1 Wallet and move the "big Wallet" every 6 Hours. From that transactions users can Know for sure  How many Bitcoins are there. In this case the "auditing commission" will be the BlockChain and the miners..not some J.P. Morgan's alike company

I have few much than a bitcoin. So even if  bticoin gets 10 times its value this year..that won't be enough to define it a "financial success". My Business is not "nation limited" , I deal with business process outsourcing, so in the last 20 years I experienced how it is to move money for business in countires like ROmania, Egypt, ALbania, Tunisia. SOme examples of REAL  Impractical Currency before Bitcoin:
-Simple Wire Transfer fom same branch of the same Bank from Egypt to Italy took 8 days passed through 2 different other middle banck specialized in international operations and therefore cost was 50 Euro . My Supplier recieving money had 25 Euro commission 
-In Albania Employees have to change bank  if they want their salary accredited without errors and delays
-In Romania i get a 25 Euro NON negotiable fee if I buy 3 Euro  service from google wallet for my application on android using by Credit Card froM Albania
I could simply show you how much money goes by when you use Banks or credit card services. That is needed by our lifestyle today, we use internet, our businesses usually goes outside our countries , or perhaps our hobbies, family relations, and why not..some people have boy/Girl friends in different Countries.
That is impractical but we are used to it , so some of us don't see it.
There are a lot of people considering internet impractical, and , for them it's true... for some other Internet  is just an improved way of living.

They probably will try to :
-Put some money and show to people that they fixed it
-Then they will contact user who had money in GOX telling them to wait years for having their coin back OR accept some stock options of the company

FInally they will ask investors to put more Money and disappear again unless Bitcoins skyrocket to the moon.

If a "Big whale" wants to buy those coins an effective way would be :

This way many of those interested in the auction will be discouraged to go for a high price.

I used their exchange, successfully and quickly.
I tried the service both sending FIAT and recieving FIAT and was very quick.
The service was definitely in a pre BETA  condition:
WHen i registered  there were a couple of bugs who were blocking me from registering, bugs were fixed after i sent email to support
First time i tried to send BTC there was a bug showing a wrong (not valid) Btc Adress. The problem was promptly fixed after i sent email to support.
Once i was inside the volume  trades shown on  Graphs were  definitely fake (too high volumes for ROmania and all trades were done Under market value for me and "all other customers")
The service was down without explanation for a couple of days at least (then i didn't  care to check when exactly it was up again)
When i sent fiat from exchange to my ROmanian Bank Account  it didn't work until i sent an email to support, at that point transfer was instanteneus.
I think an exchange should at least have some "standards" before operating (tested and MAJOR BUG free)
Programmer did a low quality job (Yes I think for an exchange a bug in the front page , in the generating BTC adddress and in the "sending fiat part of the software" is low quality).
Owner of the company did a poor job too : 1 programmer  as a total staff for an exchange....

Snoop dogg was fined for violating money laundry laws yes, by Italian law they would probably initiated a criminal probe too because it's not optional for that kind of crimes. Judge can dismiss eventually at the trial wich could take place in next 5 or more years and finish with 3 degrees of evalation in 15 years.
Your european bank definitely asks you the  reason why you are sending more than a definite amount 
It also  triggers AML and KYC activities at different levels of the money transmit
I don't want to argue on this, but why are you giving OP advices that uts him in trouble?
SUb is full of people saying they got account blocked after sending Thousands (not millions) and if you actually try a bank movement of 15k from Italy to Romania, From Romania to France you will definitely step in to what I said.

If you want to send a NORMAL email is free....
1) How did you get your account? (is it ad free? )
2)In some countries for having a legal value you should subscribe to a paid service for a sort of "legal autenthication"
3)Then there is the problem of security and privacy (Hillary Clinton anyone?)

Hello, no one hates you or think you are stupid.
Software and systems naturally evolves during time, imagine in 1994 someone saying: How can I use it for work if i can't use it as I use my fax?
Bitcoin in it's early form (How Satoshi designed it) wasn't designed to do ALL things you can do with fiat, like (for example) buying a cofee at the cofee machine. I use bitcoin weekly to pay a developer working for my website, for paying my hosting provider, to buy hardware from a pc STORE, air tickets etc, all in a more easy and convenient way than fiat or credit card.
This being said, there are solutions in development to make bicoin use cases adapt to even microtransactions or instant transactions : the most promising is Lightning Network,

Hello, I read this sub a lot and I see no hate, actually you may have noticed there's not so much talk about it wether price is up like last week or down like from the beginning.
It's boring going on a sub that should be talking about bitcoin and reading about every of the hundreds of Alts that are around (Monero, ripple, DOge, Litecoin etc). 
Imagine how would this page be with every alt coin supporter coming and posting dozen of articles that are related to bitcoin with a "Bitcoin will be dead". 
So for this reason there is moderation keeping arguments about altcoins away and LUCKILY since we are on a free wrold...people can chose to read other subs, like specifics to their altcoin or just dedicated to Crypto.
Bitcoin is trying to keep it's network p2p friendly, that means running a node on whatever machine you want , from a rasperry pi to the 2011 laptop you forgot in your garage.  In 20 years when we all wish at least 10% of people is using bitcoin everyday.... the idea of having registered on the blockchain (and stored by millions of p2p nodes) every coffee vending machine operation or any bus ticket people buy... will be considered childish.
I use bitcoin for buying things (things i couldn't buy with BCH for example) and when i do is because fee would be lower that way than with credit card or paypal .
Please understand this is a sub for talking about bitcoin and not for talking about any other Alt coin

Not saying they are a scam, just can-t blame other people joking about them untill delivery of several batches is done with success.
TO put it in perspective an EVil twin of Jihan could start FUD , sockpuppets, rumors etc in march saying the company doesn't exist, that it's a scam, and will work so well since from the beginnning they forget even to write their name and address

Hello, I think you left 1 important variable in your perfect description: TIME
If you re-write the post and factor in the TIME variable you probably will understand why now with the current adoption far from even 1% it is normal to have price swing at the slightest news. You will probably agree that when adoption is over 50% (100 Years? 500 Years? WHo knows? but for sure not next 20 years) value swing will be distributed on a different population surface so it will be definitely different from today.
The last part of your Thoughts are definitely something we should see every day, bitcoin is for Math people ...not gamblers.

Didn't say anything about electricity.
If you are able to declare a miner as a computer you should consider smuggler's career.
But then again why the risk?
You could just  use fiat and "arrange that underhand after declaring it as a 'computer" or better some kind of service (that are exempt from VAT and customs.
Understand that however you include or not Bitcoin or miners in your method you are laundrying money the most common way, fake invoices.
Fiat is usually better and more untraceble for money laundry :-)
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:22:05
I understand. 
A few antminers equals a few Thousands Euro DOllar or similar
I understood you wanted to launder a lot of money and I was pointing out that fake invoices doesn't work on scale, like mining on scale dpesn't work either...FIAT on the other hand is more easy just take the money you would use for antminer abroad and then do whatever you please without complicating yourslf with a mining operation.
The mechanics are always the same...if it's a few thousands DOllars you won't have problems...if it's more.. paper trails will still be there to hunt you if and when you will be rich

Just to help you put that in the right perspective: today we have around 10k full Nodes, many countries have no nodes at all, and countries with 80 million people have something around 3 nodes. We are not "as large as that". 
Asic mining was not still discovered and would be interesting knowing what Satoshi would think about Bitcoin based on a hardware produced by JUST ONE company that happens to be in a country known for blocking internet access when they need censuring.
We know he asked for EXPLICITLY waiting mining with GPU, and that he wrote it was nice that everyone could  mine with a PC.

Thanks. Reading some of Satoshi quotes it seems to me that some of his "labels" for concepts should be changed. FOr example when he say "nodes" he definitely means "Miners" (and eventually a node) so when he refers to"clients"....is it wrong thinking he refers to what we now call NODES?

@_date: 2017-04-18 08:26:08
In this context for Satoshi NODE and MINERS are the same.  So Unless you start considering Nodes that don't mine some  "fancy surplus" the considerations are incomplete and not related to the problem that a peer 2 peer network needs millions of nodes everywhere in the world to be fully decentralized. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:42:40


"In the design PDF it's called Simplified Payment Verification"  
   " when he refers to"clients"
 
"I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions. "
Makes sense because , thinking of a p2p network like gnutella, the "NODE" is the client sharing files
(sorry if my formatting is bad).
@_date: 2017-04-18 17:46:27
Well the example of the bible is perfect, also reading the Bible need a context or can be misinterpreted. 
GPU's are made for many purposes,  and there are lots' of producers... Asic miners on the other hand are produced ONLY for making money and as far as I know only produced in 1 VERY NOT DECENTRALIZED country. (nothing against CHina or comunism in general...just I don't think they are PRO decentralization....)
@_date: 2017-04-11 05:35:56
(please keep in mind we are in the field of fiction because we have no proof and no way of getting any proof about this)
You ask "Why?"
It's quite simple: ANy person making illegal money need to  hide it if we are speaking of enourmous quantities.
You can't just go to a bank and deposit 1 Million (actually even 20 k could be suspicious) saying you had them at home and now you decided to deposit them
Especially in a country where they take very seriously  the argument of comunism.
Plus if money rules (as well as freedom) are very strict on some countries...people will generally like to use those Millions outside their borders.
And add to that that there are taxes in almost all countries when you move a huge amount of personal money from one country to another
SO well before Bitcoin there has been ways to "money launder"... people have been doing illegal movement of big amount of money since a long time and they get arrested every year in europe for that.
This money laundering has a cost ..depending on the difficulty you have in your country it varies from 20% to even a sounding 50%
["The report estimates that in 2009, criminal proceeds amounted to 3.6% of global GDP, with 2.7%  (or USD 1.6 trillion) being laundered. "]  ( )
So in this fictional thesis, A chinese "man" having 100 Million dollars (we can call him PINKING)  from illegal profit could :
* give that money to a big mining organization (let's call it BEES) . 
* Bees will order  from a friendly Asic producer 1 k graphic cards for their Graphic workstation
* Asic producer will buy 1k  cheap graphic card and produce  100 Million worth of miner
* Bees will declare  working on a graphic project on his own or better invoice some KINGPIN's shell companies
* Even if Miners will produce 100 Million of dollars KINGPIN will have 80 Millions worth of bitcoin usable anywhere in the world  not taxable always ready. BEES will take 20 Million remaining ,pay asic producers, expenses  the 1k graphic cards and have as well money left
THIS economic activity has improvements if:
* You have higher miners fee
* You have cheaper electricity than normal
* You also sell your miners to other miners with a small profit
* somehow you have a 20% boost
* You use your miners 2 Month and then you sell it s new to other miners (this will likely hide MORE your activity to financial inspectors and law enforcement)
* The country you live in starts a war on capital hiding (more need for KINGPIN to hide money=even 60 Million is ok )
Again I am serious when I say this is fiction, would would have to be a (NON CoRRUPTED)  smart and very powerfull Law enforcement  organization in CHINA to have a little shred of proof.
What a real KINGPIN wouldn't like in this case would be too much pubblicity on the matter.

"specialised hardware" can mean anything but since Satoshi was "envisioning" definetly the generic words fit ... the problem is that asic carries problems related to TOTAL lack of decentralization.
It's the same Satoshi who asked for a TOTAL delay of the use of GPU mining .... he wanted (node + miners) decentralized, now that node and miners are almost never the same machine we should probably re-read and put in the right context to understand . Times changes so statement can have a different meaning in different contexts. Since we are on the matter...do Someone has some quote from Hal Finney on the Matter?

CSW has not

 &gt;&gt;Doesn’t care what people think.  He’s not a normal guy. Genius’ are on another level, and as much as people don’t want to admit he’s a really smart guy 
CRAIG IS THAT YOU?
because they are sticking with Satoshi doesn’t exist side, he is actually beyond brilliant with or without bitcoin / blockchain. There’s no disputing he was one of the first in bitcoin.
LOTS of elements says he was not involved in the beginning (example: if you had bitcoin at beginning...why the hell would you buy from MTGOX at 1000$ ??)

I think anyone who doesn't agree that Hearn is an Amazing Developer should check reality and the code he wrote.
That said there are a lot of developers comunities (linux for example) where a part that quits define toxic, probably it's part of the job ...
Think what they say about Linus Torvalds, people have their strong ideas, they are passionate so they create a very hard environment that is borderline with Harrassing for us normal people.
STILL: Was Hearn that choose to make a post saying very clearly:" I SOLD ALL MY CRYPTO" , he was aware, since he is really intelligent, that the interview  that people would loose money for his message. So people are gonna answer and let him know that OBVIOUSLY selling all his crypto was a wrong choice from the economical point of view (I agree that anyway is a good way to show he has integrity).
As a side note his interestin Bitcoin was by his ammission , the interest yu gave to a cool project, he said he didn't even kept the key of the first 50 btc he recieved(250k $ now) because for him all that wasn't anything but a cool experiment. He has integrity, he is a world class developer, he didn't care enough to find the motivation to stay in a HARD environment, where there were people that probably wouldn't loose keys to even 0.01 btc.

Hello and thank you for being present in the discussion these last weeks despite some bad behaviours we can all see on some people of this sub answering.
What are your views about Garzik trying to HIDE NYA nodes?
If you add:
-Agreement done between some people at closed doors
-With miners who anyway forked for a coin that HELPS MINERS mining with a better profitability (EDA)
-The need Garzik feels to make everyone unable to recognize NYA nodes (I would define it as node spoofing)
-Total absence of replay protection
The result is something shady and definitely rushed.
Since you showed at least the will to discuss....what about a plain discussion on the development of btc1 with developers on btc1?
Copy pasting COre's code, in a rush hiding nodes and god knows what else will happen is NOT the right way to FORCE a fork you can't be sure all the majority of users NEED

By your count there are 600k People, real people who doesn't feel like they belong to the situation they are now.
EVen  if they were 200k  why should they be forced to belong to a Nation they Do not want?
I am not entering in reasoning about the referendum, the economic, the probabble populistic campaign or even the rules of information in Catalonia. A wide group of people wants to have their own nation and they decided it organized and pacifically so they have my admiration, do you really find it so strange?

The information you are talking about are emails provided by CSW to his dead friends' family in order to gain the keys.
In the same suit there is a PROOF of a fake document from CSW using a dead man's name..(really? you fake your dead friends signature for money?)
He didn't want to go public you say...so he hired SPICE GIRLS's comunication agency ....
Your vote is your opinion, I guess you already understood you are being bamboozled too

Just to be clear I wasn't implying people should avoid using coinbase if they wish. Just hold the BTC on a wallet and not on some exchange, especialy those exchanges that have the habits of not giving forked coins to it's user right away. So you can use coinbase if you like it, move your coins to your wallet some time before the fork and move them again after the fork if you fell safe about fork's results

Never mentioned Bgold. 
I was speaking of Bitcoin Cash and S2x
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:06:09
No, they support BCH because it's been made more easy to mine (as per their request) with an EMERGENCY difficult adjustment (Strange that emergency comes recurrently) They are even starting to make programs that shift between BCH and BTC based on that... so the reason is NOT because it has replay protection.
ABout your last sentence, even with ethereum there were a lot of VERY technical experts saying the same, still there are 2 Ethereums now, the one with most value is the one were original developers stayed

At the moment this thread doesn't seem this toxic to me.

The topic  was clearly about bitcoin. I understand there could be hundreds of way to write it , but people answering and staying out of the Bitcoin topic hijacked it.

OP Here.
I should explain better then.  First  of all  the choice of word is hiding that the fork is S2X producing that bigger Block, only Mr Murrone is afraid of saying that there will be a HARD FORK on which they are supporters. The explanation is literally "At that point some miners may decide to ignore that block and continue mining on a 1MB block max-sized chain and that may create another fork in the Bitcoin Network."
It's not up to debate: wether or not S2x will be the majority fork, wether or not Core disappears forever, the fork is generated by the changes BTC1 will  try.
Then the comunication has a real clear message : "Just like we did with the Bitcoin Cash fork (..)we will make the new coin available for you to easily sell or withdraw "  They literally kept MONEY in moments when value was 0,20 Btc and now that value is 3 times less they claim it was a good thing.
They explicitly say that you should leave your btc with them and that's for me a signal : someone hinting at you leaving your money with them...usually it's time to take BTC out (Remember ROger Ver saying all was ok with money in MT GOX?)
Apart from that , BTC1 is developing with lots of mistakes, few developers, without proper testing outside of any business standard when we talk about this kind of Money in play.
It's my opinion this doesn't show in any way Garzik's lack of skills or ability, he's a world class developer: just the time that CEO of the NYA  decided  to develope the fork is wrong.
Than there is another important point: BTC1 Nodes will try to spoof themselves as Core nodes (again, not an opinion, just how the code was  done): what kind of company decide to consider  a fork that is so weak it has to spoof Core's node to even work?
Hashrate validates the blockchain but it is not everything: the value of Bitcoin is ALSO in the know-how developed (the 100+ person contributing Github at the moment is a HUGE VALUE), in the peer to peer network (that is why btc1 needs to spoof it's nodes) and more.
I would add that they claim (not in the blog post though) to know what their users want, without asking their users
PLEASE UNDERSTAND that XAPO can choose whatever they want for their business, but same goes for me, that is why it's time to leave it and take all my btc out so if I want to sell them when I can get 3 times more.... then I CAN DO IT.
This message doesn't mean in any way XAPO is a bad company, my suggestion is to keep your money with you and put them back in Xapo right after the fork

 " The $300m investment by Japanese GMO, which will bring a much needed breath of fresh air. And who knows, perhaps Intel, Nvdia, AMD, ARM or others are quietly working on a SHA256 ASIC. All of this investment, gone. All these people, pissed off. SERIOUSLY pissed off."
If there is a change of POW at least initially there won't be any asic so GPU mining would be the way that means : " Intel, Nvdia, AMD, ARM" would  probably be lobbying for POW change to happen (it's a speculation no source on this)
As for the companies deciding to invest when there was already the VERY REMOTE possibility of a pow change: they have done their homework (or should have)  .
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:20:46
So we disagree but at least I understand your point.
Keeping the post on topic with BTC, as a Spanish citizen you think that using bitcoin will not help Catalonian people to defend against SOME the financial  and monetary "countermeasures" that will come?
(Of course Bitcoin will not be helpfull against SPanish Army or Police, I am referring only to financial  and monetary measures)
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:13:31
Care to show any datas in your emotional message?
Bicoin as it has been in last years is the result of code commits you can pubblicly see on github, 100+ developers from all cultures, religions, companies, backgrounds and ages.They took that work from a line of developers that began with Satoshi and Hal Finney.  Personally I am Sad Gavin is not anymore between them but still look:  more thatn 100 people coding and committing code every week. The update Segwit was literally DENIED by miners untill rumors of a fork was around, then they forked into Bitcoin Cash with an algorithm that helps them mine 47 blocks in 1 hours and get 4.7 times more often the block reward...
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:12:44
The fork make an exact copy of the blockchain from the genesis blck to that moment and i so after the fork you have "2chains".
Your  adress is the same for both coins so if you take a bitcoincash wallet and import your private keys thereyou have coins on both wallet
when you move them from now on they have different paths... so you can use them as you wish...for example many sold Bitcoin cash ...making the amount of bitcoin they had bigger.
Any wallet that gives you control of the keys is ok
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:56:34
Why you say it's a misconception: Most Core developers said it clearly and NO ONE said they will switch to BTC1.
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:50:56
Last August fork owner of btc were given same amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). With that amount you can sell BCH for BTC (gaining from 10% to 20% of value) or keep bch.
People on coinbase had none of the above. Their bch is kept by Coinbase so they have no change of using it.
Download a wallet to you phone or to your pc use coinbase as much as you wish and move as quicly as you can your btc to your wallet, don't leave them in COinbase
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:33:50
TO be fair these reasearchers maybe a little biased
"The wallets in question are the Bitcoin.com and Jaxx Blockchain wallet. Cheetah mobile reached out to the wallet developers to let them know about the vulnerability. This also coincided with the release of Cheetah’s very own Bitcoin wallet that is called “SafeWallet”"

@_date: 2017-10-05 07:11:47
I personally wish that too. We may be on the minority side because of the large number of people that will do nothing (example: won't upgrade nodes and won't ban btc1 spoofed nodes,won't take out money from exchanges giving the impression they like exchange's choice). Even on the minority side I would hold, wait for a pow, prepare to help mining with some GPU and buy more btc if price tanks to 40 $ . But making lists of villains makes me think I am on the right side of the fence, with the wrong people
@_date: 2017-10-06 04:52:15

The fact they support it is because they are in the group that signed NYA (no shame in that) and try to make it look like doing nothing is HARD FORKING

If you read their comunication they start with describing the happening of the fork like it is the normal way. Normal transactions like the ones we are doing now are descibed by them as a fork.
TIll now I never saw the bitcoin comunity being ok with ANY companies telling you to leave long time your money with them  without users having control of the private keys.
In bitcoin is your money if you control the keys.
Anyone hinting your money is safe with them sounds a little odd for BTC.

"miners will drop support"
To be fair Miners giving support mean nothig concrete. They are supporting Also Bcash and can support 9 or 10 Altcoin as well is they fork it from bitcoin.
Giving support doesn't implicate keeping hashrate at a fixed level for a fix number of years, ACTUALLY it doesn't even mean they have to include transactions in blocks because they are even mining empty blocks. 
The Miners who signed the agreement were promoters of the Bitcoin Cash FOrk that is the sign of SUPPORTING DIRECTLY A FORK

Spain reaction can be in many different ways, from diplomatical to economical, from political to the use of force.
EXAMPLE&gt; Spain can froze all Bank accounts in Catalonia. block any bank transfer from Banks in Catalaonia, Apply pression to the other nations in europe to do the same.
I am not sure why you need thosestatements to be justificated since I am not SPanish government and there will be no official plan on whet they will do untill they will start acting
Imagine if next week in Catalonia Banks are closed by their SPanish HQ, Visa and masterard not processing, Paypal delaying any transfer to a country wich is not yet being recognized by any other country.

@_date: 2017-10-06 04:05:44
Your reasoning is pretty clear and for the most part I would say we agree . 3 points are  not true
- Blocks are not full (Not debatable it's a fact that mempool is now pretty empty)
-27% of the network upgraded to 0.15.x seems large since it's less than a month and that it requier,res action Btc1 decided  to signal they are NO2SX seems to me the 2x people  are less
-Loosing 100+ Core developers in this space is a lot (I know....this is debatable)
As final consideration have you asked yourself  how many of the actual less than 10k nodes in the world wouldn't work if blockchain was 300 GB?  (I installed a node yesterday discovering had to change HD on my old server)

They would like to be an independent country.
That means (eventually if Spain somehow let them)  millions of new arrangements for Trade, finance, taxes, Bank...EU can't have good relation  with a country that is not member and that defnitely is not in good relation with Spain.
Imagine individuals and company being blacklisted for sending goods or money to Catalonia, banks not sending money directly but through intermediary .

I don't think the general message is "Don't use Coinbase" (but yes there are extremists here too :-) ).
If you follow this sub since a couple of years or more, or if you go back and search in last 4 years you will find a clear message: WHatever exchange you use , after you have your bitcoin MOVE THEM OFF to a wallet that have you and only you hold the keys.
That was before the blocksize debate..and it's also now.
Any exchange or service trying to hint the old Bank motto "Your money is more secure with us"  will get bashed... probably because the comunity didn't bash Enough exchanges like MTGOX (remember ROger Ver video saying MTGOX was SOlvent and your money was therefore very safe?)

You are right, they have no legal duty, nor they felt an ethical duty to give to people airdropped valued coins.
I am not say in any way COinbase stole money or they did something illegal.
Still people should learn from what happens in reality: Leaving bitcoins in COinbase during a fork = 20% of gains are blocked and can't be turned into bitcoins

 Nothing wrong at having MANY miners with specialized hardware in server farms connected to 1 or 2 nodes Having ONLY miners in server farms is not a reliable peer to peer network.

Do I think their massive number would be important for the survival of the Peer 2 Peer Network? Yes and they should be rewarded with some sort of value
Without nodes  we would be speaking of a small network of server farms  connected to pools using hardware manufactrued from 3 Companies all in a country who does not value Freedom to the standard most of us have.

(Like if I own 300 Nodes on the same AWS server...it's not really 300 Nodes...it's just 1)

He also gave an Idea  on when network would be fully  developed ..100k Nodes...we are at 8k now
I am not saying we don't need blocksize increase now (actually now fees are ok and mempool's ok...) but since it's not a Turbo PAscal project for Science fair probably optimizing the network before raising the number of transaction it will carry it's not only common practice among engineers but also safest way.

That is the good part of Asic. 
Asic technology is use only in 1 country which happens to be one of those countries who believe LESS in free markets and free internet.
This is not a technical optimization but an economic flaw.
Producers of CPU and GPU  are much more than 3:
So Asic means also Centralized Miners.
Just imagine if a Nation puts in 100% of the miners  a kill switch without telling his customers...

Hello, I upvoted you and have no intention of calling you anything so please don't be scared like your post seems.
If I read it right 
"Basically, you must resell and replace the miners every 8-12 weeks"+ "buy 1,000 miners for the September shipment of new S9's"
That means that by november you will have to place 1000 miners selling them to 1000 people who wouldn't have profit not even if they had free energy 
If you are able to do that (with a scale of 4 k miners every year for 20 years ) you definitely have skills and those skills are worth your profit.

TLDR: 
Article about CSW 's Mom : Wright’s mother had told me about her son’s long-standing habit of adding bits on to the truth, just to make it bigger. ‘When he was a teenager,’ she said, ‘he went into the back of a car on his bike. It threw him through the window of a parked car. That’s where his scar comes from. His sister accompanied him to the hospital and he’s telling the doctor that he’s had his nose broken twenty or so times, and the doctor is saying “You couldn’t possibly have had it broken.” And Craig says: “I sew myself up when I get injured.”’ What his mother said connected with something I’d noticed. In what he said, he often went further than he needed to; further than he ought to have done. He appeared to start with the truth, and then, slowly, he would inflate his part until the whole story suddenly looked weak.

1) There is lack of liquidity, if I want to go to my bank and ask for 5k Euro they may tell me to come the day after because they have to plan in advance for not running ran out of bills . Atms running out of cash is very common
2) About regulation ...in the capital in 1 of the main roads where police passes  thousands of time there are dozens of people with DOllars or Euro in their hands showing them and trying to attract customers. They are exchanging money without license

There's nothing wrong in what you wrote.
It's very true that "Bitcoin relies on proof-of-work and the security to survive government attacks is based on this." but it's not the only  security feature. Being a Strong peer 2 peer network is important as well.
As for what Satoshi knew....just look at the title of the Whitepaper: Bitcoin : a Peer to Peer ....
Right from the start Satoshi says it is a peer to peer network
A Worldwide peer to peer  network needs thousands of nodes in every nation, that way Blockchain will exist forever and everywhere.
That does not mean Miners are not important, that doesn't mean a peer to peer network alone is ok ...we need both.

@_date: 2017-07-01 05:15:04
The pattern of language he uses, the aggressivity before being attacked...everything is part of Old style scammers.
Still even in the science fiction hypotesis that he was Satoshi:
I was charmed by Satoshi's way of " I Kinda did it Backwards" ...he first developed and coded bitcoin then came out to face doubts, accusations and criticism. CWR got angry for asking to move 5$
I was amazed by Satoshi patience answering people about his theory. CSW  puts his theory with NLP  style language "We Will do" "Our team Know" "It is like I say STOP"
I was amused by Satoshi's light sense of humor  in some answers very light, classy and never fuorious. CSW seems  a stressed professor  who always speak about code first but who doesn't know to code at all and is ASHAMED.
SO in this fictional movie where CSW is Satoshi... I have been scammed, I will fictionally sell all my bitocins and buy some One COIN...

Just a clarification about Craig Right's article
It is again a copy of someone else work:
BitcoinIsTehFuture 
I think Craig Wright read post and my replies from several days ago and put it into his own words to make this article.
 
My replies (1)(2) on June 17, 2017:
    "This growing attack vector (the pot increases as time goes on) incentivizes smart users to stay on the main chain when making transactions and to not make SegWit transactions."
    "Basically: While normal transactions become more secure the more confirmations they have, SegWit transactions become less secure the more transactions there are. SegWit transactions are inversely secure to the length of the chain."
 
Craig's article on June 19, 2017:
    "As the volume of payments into SegWit addresses increase, the incentives for miners to defect from the network also increase."
    "As bitcoin becomes more widely used under its default protocol, it becomes more and more secure and less vulnerable to attack (which is a key feature of its default protocol). SegWit alters the protocol fundamentally in a manner that is opposite to this. That is, it allows it to become more and more vulnerable over time."
    "...every transaction involving SegWit and not being relayed into a standard bitcoin address slowly increases incentive to attack the system. The larger the system, the larger the incentives to defect. This is exactly the opposite of the existing protocol dynamics within bitcoin: the larger the bitcoin ecosystem and hashrate grows (using bitcoin’s original protocol), the more secure it becomes."

Hello, I read both.
r/Bitcoin is more moderated than 3 years ago,  more readable on one side, but as always moderating a forum come with what many people call censorship.
 r/Btc is minimally moderated but usually poor of contents, unless what you search is some bad views of core developers, bad views on how bad bitcoin has come . No funny or cheering posts  on how good bitcoin value is  doing,  lately no bad news about coinbase, no good consideration about core developers or their projects.
It's not censored....just downvoted while upvoting post like "Greg Maxwel is a liar" "Blockstream ruined bitcoin"" "Luke JR is ridiculous" FIrst time you could read that...but after a while you will see it becomes boring... 
lastly r/btc 's people  are definitely conviced Craig Wright is Satoshi, has 6 PHD. The upvotes about this are unbielevable

(posting same answer I wrote on the other sub )
I read both since the beginning, or try to read both at least. rbitcoin has more rules about the contents and evidently censors things that are considered outside the guidelines. You can find more links to code and technical reviews there They cheers everytime bitcoin goes a little up as value
rbtc Has no censorship (unless it's really REALLY bad) But posts that are not in line with the general view usually gets bad answers, instant downvotes ., insults. Look at Nullc's post trying to state a technical point and see the answers he gets without any technical explanation.
NO cheers when bitcoin goes up on the market, but a lot of complaining on how bad the bitcoin world is
RBTC is sometimes an echo chamber, for example last month there was as a top post a tweet by Jihan saying that rbtc is great
The result is that rbtc sometimes is not easy to read... first 10 posts usually are a repetiton on how bad is Bitcoin , how bad are core, how stuck are transactions.
I think plurality of information is very important, but somehow if the second source of information is difficult (BORING) that makes the UNILATERAL information more powerfull.
On a funny note on rbtc you can find pepole telling Adam Back that he should go and read POW better  Something like that would requied a scientific dissertation to say the list...on rbtc it's more simple: You state that and if you have upvotes...it's true!
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:19:17

Some more Satoshi QUotes:
"Besides, 10 minutes is too long to verify that payment is good.  It needs to be as fast as swiping a credit card is today.
See the snack machine thread, I outline how a payment processor could verify payments well enough, actually really well (much lower fraud rate than credit cards), in something like 10 seconds or less.  If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.
"Instantant non-repudiability is not a feature, but it's still much faster than
existing systems. Paper cheques can bounce up to a week or two later. Credit
card transactions can be contested up to 60 to 180 days later. Bitcoin
transactions can be sufficiently irreversible in an hour or two.

I will not downvote you but asking people "prove he is not Satoshi" seems a little childish or from usual silly FUD.
TO prove you are someone it's YOu who have to provide proofs not the rest of the world providing proof you are not.
Otherwise I could Say i am r/iasaiahtx and you have no proof of the contrary.
CW provided a proof he is Satoshi to Gavin, a FAKE PROOF proved 2 days later, then he announced he will make a transaction from satoshi adress... "Gavin will send me 5$ and i will send them back"
Gavin sent the 5$ and then CW posted an angry Tweet with swearing and promise to disappear....but he was lying

He specifies later what is " certain point" : near  100k Nodes

Nothing wrong at having MANY miners with specialized hardware in server farms connected to 1 or 2 nodes
Having ONLY miners in server farms is not a reliable peer to peer network.

May I suggest you post it also in "the other sub"?
Your case needs more visibility .
I hope you solve it
Since you are speaking of Real Banks I had the same problem with real banks
I sent a SWIFT wire transfer to a supplier, same amount as every month since 4 years, chosen from Online Banking Interface, using same address from bookmark as always.
60k Euro disappeared, without any explanation, customer care was stuck in "probably your supplier has not checked well"or "did you check swift code was ok?"
BAnk director had to call  HQ for 1 week to discover that money was sent to a wrong nation and wrong Bank for no reason. 
Had to wait 1 month to know WHere was "my money" 1 month to know IF it was going to come back 1 month waiting it came back.
All this without finding any single errore on my side .
