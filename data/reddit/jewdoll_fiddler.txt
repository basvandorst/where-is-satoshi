while we're on the topic of blockchain, maybe you can help me. When i try to sell my bitcoin it says that "i need to have at least 45 EURO". I have 0 dollars in my wallet and the rest in the blockchain wallet. Do I have to transfer to my local wallet in order to sell and cash out?

I tried the same a few days ago. Same problem. Maybe I should store my btc elsewhere...

Thank you. I believe I figured it out. It seems that I need the btc in my wallet instead of on the site itself. Getting antsy watching the price rise and I need to teach myself how to sell them before I shit hits the fan.

I dont plan on selling, but does anyone know what "Unfortunately, you need at least 48.48 EUR to sell." means? I have bitcoin worth more than that.

Ok, thanks for the information.
I found a file in folder blockchain.info called wallet (date).json  EDIT: 1kb. Is this file of any use? It's from the day I bought the bitcoin, actually
edit: some googling makes me believe this is the correct file. its called wallet_18_12_2013_23_28_43.aes.json

I've figured out I own .211 bitcoins. It's not much but definitely worth it to try to access them.

lol, my coins.
Anyway. Been in contact with a friend and we've found out that they key i have is what he called a public key. i can see the bitcoins on blockchains.info but apparently cant access them. The website i bought them from has been shut down by the government. it seems my only hope is that i stored something on the old computer back them (dec13) that can help me. 
Does this seem reasonable?

I did, and it actually worked. I'm now 610 dollars richer than I was an hour ago. It's not much, but I'm happy. Finding that file on the old computer was a stroke of good fortune.

the site was called bitcoinsnorge.no back then but they had to close due to problems involving norwegian banks or something. date is dec18 2013
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:15:55
It seems to be. Never knew what it was called. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:10:55
Is this info a definite no to the chance of retrieving the bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:10:36
Yeah, thanks for the advice. I don't really need the money so I'm in it for the long haul. I know the volatility of these currencies is big, but if it crashes it's no big deal for me anyway.

wooosh. Sorry, but I didn't understand any of that, really. Open an online wallet is what you're saying?
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:14:34
There are tons of wallets to choose from. Do I pick one at random? Pick one from the sidebar suggestions?
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:50:14
It wasn't, gladly. I had the presence of mind to download a wallet backup without really realizing what I was doing in 2013. 600% increase on 100 dollars aint that bad.
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:15:31
That's correct. 34 characters. Never opened a wallet (i dont think). I guess this is the next step?
