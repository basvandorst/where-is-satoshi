Or the laser tag ..... OK that's a maybe then?

Do we procicute thought crime?

Seems reasonable its like they have a warrant from a judge to search your house.

Sorry I did not realize you lived in a dictatorship, I live in a moder democracy where we vote for our government. I could see that you might want war lords instead of a tyrant it gives people more positions to aspire too after all only one person can be supreme ruler but there is so many opportunities to be brutal thugs.

And that is the problem with bitcoin.

Or lose 30 % of its value in the past week.

Who mentioned the patriot act? Who even said we were talking about the US? 
@_date: 2013-08-13 14:10:58
I am talking about the meaning of the term not actual application of it.


What are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-08-13 14:26:58
That is exactly my point. That is what I said in my comment. I was responding to someone who held that misconception.

Living in a country with a functioning government seems like a much better option than living in anarchy. I don't want to live in Somalia.

From what I heard it was a tax haven for rich Russians.

Unfortunately they are both full of shit. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:14:42
It just seems overly destructive, taxes are what pay for schools, roads, NHS, rule of law, safety agency's that do every thing from keep lead out of children's toys to stopping building being built in an haphazard way. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 10:51:14
The thing is though pretty much every bitcoin theft has been through hacking.
@_date: 2013-08-13 14:49:57
I have read it. Doesn't look like you have (or maybe you haven't understood it).
@_date: 2013-03-22 12:38:15
It just does't feel like someone who downloaded a mining client and "casually mined" took any risk. 


Normally that means investing a lot of money or time not just got lucky by hearing about something early.
@_date: 2013-07-06 01:08:28
Much better to.devalue by 30% in a week. 
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:11:47
Nice straw man you have errected there, I don't claim to love government or that government does no wrong. I just think that we do better with it than without it.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:08:49
Seems like a better system than being a serf to some war lord.
@_date: 2013-08-13 13:58:28
That is the opposite of what net neutrality means, no double speak here.
@_date: 2013-08-13 14:01:22


It doesn't mean that, it just means that networks couldn't selectively limit certain traffic  but not others. They can still cap your internet.
@_date: 2013-02-08 00:52:02
If bit coin ever took off in a big way I am sure people would not properly protect there wallets and there would be a rash of theft. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:42:28
It is currently returning 502 for about 90% of page requests and takes about a minute to load for the 10%. I would hardly call that an improvement.
@_date: 2013-05-11 21:03:21
Seems like they had something more like google wallet or something like [this](  in mind rather than bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:15:44
Stuff like this is to try and take a chunk of all the money that gets put into Cyprus to avoid taxes so would not necessarily happen in other countries.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:34:54
You are misunderstanding, oil and minerals cost a lot of money to mine and drill but at the end of the process you have something tangible that can be sold/used where as bitcoin is just a proof of work that doesn't have any intrinsic "value".
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:59:26
That is why I put value in quotes. I just saying that a tone of iron or a barrel of oil is a physical thing that has an actual use other than having an market value.

Most PayPal users don't look like drug traffickers.

What has the FCC got to do with any of this? From the Wikipedia article:


Nothing more, nothing less. There is no "double speak" net neutrality means a neutrality in internet service.
