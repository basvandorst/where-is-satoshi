They don't don't really pump up these kinds of bowl games though which are usually filled with teams that just barely make bowl eligibility. For 2014 the bowl has the 10th choice from the ACC and I couldn't find the exact numbers but it's around the 6 choice from the AAC. These would be some pretty mediocre teams, UCF or Clemson if they lost 6 games and had no interest beyond the fans of the teams. Generally though it'd most likely be games similar to the ones that came before, Wake Forest VS UConn with 20,000ish people in attendance and maybe a couple million viewers because no better bowl games are.

It could be the second place, I think the stipulation is it has to be from the top 6 choices in the AAC, the other AAC annual tie ins have choices from the same pool. It could be the  choice in the AAC, but I don't think it's likely to be so when other bowls in the pool have better match-ups with other conferences.

That's... not how bowl sponsorships work. I don't know all the details but pretty much all the minor bowls have similar arrangements where a bowl organization has a bunch of arrangements with a bunch of different and unrelated groups. The NCAA has basically no influence on the bowl and ESPN has a broadcast deal with the bowl organization. The bowl has deals with a couple of conferences that provide teams and with the stadium for the playing time. The naming rights are owned by the bowl, they are the ones who sold the rights to Bitpay. ESPN and the NCAA played virtually no part in this decision.
Also, people trust their school and maybe their conference. College football fans generally despise the NCAA and ESPN is ESPN. People probably won't care that much about the name after the first year, it's a really crappy bowl game barely a step above the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, most college football fans wont even turn on the game.
