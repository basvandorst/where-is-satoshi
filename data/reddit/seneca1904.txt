Ive rode the rides my first buy was back in march when btc was trading at 1k a btc. I sold half at 5k. I tell everyone to start small but at least start even if you throw 100 bucks at it and forget about it for a year

I guess that depends on whos on the receiving end of the bargain

Right now were on a down trend, watch the ticker, if it keeps going down wait a bit more, if it starts going up, buy in. You're still early in the game.

Would like to see how they would handle their no "fees" for trades policy that brought them to their current status

I sold a little less then half at 5.3k today but i made a nice chunk of cash. So ehh.

According to coinbase "no" you will have access to both once they feel the new chain is stable.

I mean i bought in at 3k, i sold half at 5,300 today hopping to buy back in on the dip, still waiting. Over 25% return in a month is not a bad bargain although my weak hands should hodl untill tomorrow
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:36:10
I couldn't agree more, i try what i can but there is always a risk. Hence why i sold at 5.3k, i figured it was trending like the last time it hit 5k 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:40:04
Coinbase gets a bad rap, but they have a good market. They already stated you will have acess to both blockchains coins via the app a few days after the fork
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:51:05
Honestly it wil depend when i wake up tomorrow if its over 6k, ill be happy if its sub 5k.

Be prepaired tho, potentially the fork could drop the value of the coin, so you might see dip and some think coinbase might adjust the coins to be the sum of the value. Ie 5 coins worth 5k each could equal 10 coins worth 2.5k after the fork. But the market would correct itself and hopefully the coins would maintain a value of 3-4k each a few days / weeks after the fork.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:24:27
Theres always a dip, i watched for 2 years before investing. It might not go down to 3.5k but i will propably buy back in on the corrections which i think will be around 4-4.5k. If it doesn't dipp that would be awesome too
