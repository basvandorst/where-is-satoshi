You still waiting for your lockitron too?

It wouldn't be illegal, but the cop was still trying to entrap him, as in catch him in a trap.

I think it really depends on the severity of whatever theoretical apocalyptic event we're talking about. Gold requires at the very least a regional market, but preferably national or international.
So really depends on what they mean by "world economy collapsing." If we descend into Mad Max style anarchy, gold might not be very useful.

I'm so fed up with lockitron. I lent them money interest free in 2012, it's almost 2015 and I still don't have my lock, or even any real idea of when I might get it. They finally updated my shipping estimate to August, and it's now almost October. 
I'm so tempted to get a refund, but then I will have waited all this time for nothing. Really has turned me off to the whole crowdfunding thing.

Same here. I never even knew what the Ronald McDonald house was until our family needed it. We used the one in Philadelphia. My sister was diagnosed with Leukemia at the end of high school. She fought it for two years but nothing worked. She finally decided to stop treatment and go to college anyways, while she could. So she went to classes at UPenn as a nursing student, lived in the dorms, lived like a normal college kid for about a semester or so until she was too sick, and my parents would stay at the Ronald McDonald house, which was close by. My parents are still making medical payments and she died over 10 years ago. They definitely couldn't have afforded to stay in hotels, and many families have to travel long distances to where their child can get treatment. Sorry for the rant, Ronald McDonald house is awesome!

I thought this thread was just someone random posting about possibly sponsoring a UFC fighter, then I saw your username and was like wait, I know that name. Big fan man, will be rooting for you against Santos.

I was wondering about the liquid boiling. So the vapor is captured and reused? How is the liquid cooled? Is there a separate radiator/compressor somewhere?

wow, thank you!

I know we're not all traders, but you'd think folks would have looked at enough BTC price charts to not fall for this.

I'm a huge fan. I'd also like to be able to pay in bitcoin. Their revenue models are so messed up, stuck between PPV, Network, internet. I'd love to be able to just pay a set amount and watch all the fights. Instead I pay for fight pass, the PPVs, and end up pirating the FREE events that are on TV cause I don't have a TV. Maybe it's suited to a micro transaction model, pay a few bits per fight.

They're about the same as anyone else here in the US price-wise, great customer service. Where are you finding things so cheap?
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:45:38
Will do!

just to play devil's advocate, it doesn't seem unreasonable for Mt. Gox to want Willy to be hard to track, whether it's just a bot for high-end clients, or if it was being used for nefarious reasons. But you're correct, it's definitely not multiple simultaneous instances.

As in distinct from edibles, concentrates, or any other cannabis products as the article mentions:


It sounds silly, but weed, pot, or even cannabis could mean lots of things. The whole point of the article if that this is unique because they are actually selling buds.
As the cannabis industry becomes more mature, the language is changing as well. When I go to my local dispensary, there is a menu and one section is for "Flowers" another for "Concentrates" and "Edibles" and so forth. 
I know I'm being a weed snob right now, but imagine the difficulties we have with people using proper bitcoin terminology, that probably seems silly and unnecessarily specific too.

I've always read that Finney lived doors down from ["Dorian Nakamoto's family home"](
I've never heard it clarified what that means. Where he used to live? Where his parents live(d)? or his house? (which doesn't make sense, as you mention)

Not likely no. You can think about it the same way as laundering regular currency. There are plenty of steps those coins can go through, just like money changing hands. When you receive a cash payment, do you look up the serial numbers on the bills to make sure they aren't marked? Of course not. So these coins could change hands through private wallets without anyone every being suspicious. 
The coins can also get sent to a tumbler, which is basically a large pool of coins, you put X amount in, and you get X amount of random coins out the other end. There are ways to use an exchange for similar purposes. 
The end result is that even if you tracked the coins through all those steps, the coins still belong to whoever currently controls the private keys. It's much harder to prove that the current holder was the person that actually stole them. 
Another example would be that many pieces of jewelry probably contain gold that was stolen at some point, but the owners of that jewelry, if purchased legitimately, still own that gold.
