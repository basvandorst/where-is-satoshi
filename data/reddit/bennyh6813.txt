Going up 2000% in a month isn't a bubble? Are you the same guy who said the housing market wasn't a bubble either?

Please stop trying to make inaccurate edgy programmer comments.

Lol smart traders don't give a fuck if bitcoin will be a currency or not. Redditors might care, but the reason bitcoin is worth $16k atm is from people who do not care.

Lmfao and they're not the reason the price is going up. Why the fuck do you think these new adopters are purchasing in the first place? You want to know why it rose 5k in a day? Because more money than we'll see in our entire lifetime is being traded by people that we don't know, won't ever meant, that don't care if it becomes a currency.

Based off of what? The entire U.S. economy would have to collapse for that to happen. Index funds are basically shares in a bunch of different companies. Every single one of those companies would need to fail, which is impossible to happen. You also seem to be under the idea that index funds can become overbough, that's impossible. Also the most likely thing to happen to bitcoin is for it to crash and burn. No one here disputes that, although we all are hoping it won't ever happen.

Have you never invested before lol? An index fund (such as S&amp;P) has had growth of ~7% for pretty much the past 30 years lol. We all love bitcoins here, but settle down tiger.

Nope, they are still attached to that wallet, so technically without a backup they'd be lost forever.

Tbh it's much smarter to just do low risk investments making 7-8% annually. So he's not wrong, but we all love our coins too much.

Bitcoin has also lost 75% of it's value 3 times now in under 10 years. VTI or similar things like S&amp;P haven't lost 75% of their value in 50+ years. 
Not sure how you can be this stupid.

That's not how bitcoin investment works lol.

A joke that doesn't make sense at all. I'm not thinking too hard about this, your post is at 0 upvotes. You're an idiot. Can't believe you're this retarded of a human being. Coinbase would never want to cause BTC to drop in value. Your meme makes no sense at all and is not funny.
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:57:24
How dare they inform their customers! If you think the Coinbase email created a $200 change in price, you're literally retarded.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:20:23
What? The higher BTC is worth, the more coinbase makes lmfao. Your meme is stupid.
