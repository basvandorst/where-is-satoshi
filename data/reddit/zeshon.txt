No exchange has good customer support. None of them.

No. Individual smart contacts have been attacked, and they are only as good as the people who made them.

Yeah doge got everything wrong. I was really excited for the potential, but they kept fucking up.

Probably in the pay wall section in the middle of the article.

Ledger had litecoin first, had a working bcc implementation, and will soon support neo, which trezor doesn't intend to support. I own a trezor and just bought a nano because I was not happy with how trezor handled their bcc fuck up.

We must have been reading different threads. They were pretty rude until they got called out for it.

Who cares? The fact that they were unable to actually follow through on time meant their customers thought they could depend on them, and were shown they could not. 
It does not matter that they promised something "for their customers". Good intention are worth zero dollars.  
Edit: bring in the downvotes. You've clearly got no argument.

I feel like this comment could be on any post and it would be contextual.

Not in my case, I just was aware that tax season was coming and did mine early. Mine are complex as fuck.

It could tank again today or tomorrow, everyone be cool...

1. You need bigger hardware and more internet to process bigger blocks.
2. BTC added segwit, which killed Bitmain's ASICBoost, which allowed them to mine more efficiently than everyone else. BCH doesn't have this protection.
