bahahaha you are SO wrong my friend.... I have traded on LBC for years and im MORE than HAPPY to pay the 1% fee..  Their service is well worth the fees.

no not equally as well.  I agree paper wallets are good if generated correctly.  But you cant get a deterministic paper wallet ;)
also the dude is speaking about 50btc.  i dont think $99 for a trezor is a problem.....

@_date: 2016-08-03 09:57:42
pftttt.  why would he even bother shorting the market when he knew he had a sneaky 100+ k BTC payout.  he might have called up his buddys and gave them a heads up to short the market but it wouldnt surprise me if he just took the coins.
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:00:33
why do people think this guy will need to liquidate the coins straight away?.  If it was me i probability wouldn't do anything for a year or 2.  Maybe during that couple of years i'de figure out a way to launder all those coins.  its not fucking rocket science.  but mark my words this guy WONT get caught.  Your kidding your self if you think he will

@_date: 2018-01-29 08:00:38
ide give them my bcash and tell them that was the real bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:15:14

So its not all his? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:54:37

@_date: 2018-09-20 21:09:55
Don’t lie . You bcashers have never seen $1000 before . It’s not burning coins it the cost to be included on the worlds most secure distributed ledger. And right now it’s around $0.10
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:57:43
Yes :) 
@_date: 2018-09-14 02:39:49
I would be happy to pay $1000 in fees or more to move that much.  Do you think someone moving that kind of value is worried about fees ?  All you poor bcashers fixated on a problem that does not exist...... 
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:13:12
if your moving 100's of millions im sure your happy to wait a few hours for confirmations. good luck trying to get any bcasher to accept a 0 conf payment for more than 1 + million.....

wow this is great
@_date: 2014-12-16 01:08:36
yeah i was going to put a small amount on the trezor but i dont need half.
with the paper wallets would you recomend me doing new ones with bip32?
@_date: 2018-08-21 00:15:04
Local bitcoins are the absolute worst . After trading thousands of bitcoins through their platform I had to stop using it after similar problems with their customer support . 
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:34:09
this is insane.  yeah im glad i use chrome.
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:54:55
wo wo wo what does this mean?
@_date: 2014-12-12 02:53:34
to be honest im surprised.  now tell me what i have spelt wrong in this sentence
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:19:00
Thanks for your reply.  Sorry I have already signed up but im not looking to lend any BTC just invest them.
thanks again
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:25:03
yeah .  I have done a fair bit of research on a few ppl.  I have loaned out some BTC so no Ill just wait and see what will happen  .  Looks like a good platform.
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:30:45
keepkey sucks balls compared to the trezor
@_date: 2017-02-12 03:01:26

@_date: 2017-02-15 03:11:39
they have had their doors closed for more than one year now.  They have not been accepting NZD deposits for more than one year.
@_date: 2017-02-14 08:46:38
Yeah I own a couple of each . Hands down the trezor wins for software. Yeah I agree the screen on the trezor is smaller but I still prefer it anyway of the week. Being able to select fee's label ING addresses. Etc 
@_date: 2017-02-11 07:22:30
who do they bank with vietcomm?
@_date: 2017-02-02 06:19:27
Haha no thanks 
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:34:33
yeah hindsight is a wonderful thing.  Thing is, no one knows where the BTC price is headed.  I brought them in the beginning as a long term investment not to day trade them.
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:59:02
i can remember this.  he just 'found' 200k.  this is getting very crazy very fast
@_date: 2015-01-19 10:48:30
jesus.  this blows my mind.  I cant imagine this guy running an exchange the size of gox.  he was more impressed my his own shitty automatic door lock than anything else.  he does not even see the positive benefits of BTC.  
@_date: 2016-03-17 01:34:38

Omg these farking cunts. Don't try to break encryption because your to lazy to keep up with the world . This shit makes my blood boil.  I don't want children to grow up in a world like this . ....
@_date: 2015-01-12 22:28:14
ha.  what a load of rubbish.  These 'terrorists ' are already breaking the law in many ways so 'banning' end-to-end encryption wont even matter one bit.  The 'terrorists ' will just use some "illegal" encryption software to secure there comms. (they dont care about laws)   The real reason I suspect this muppet is saying this is they dont wont normal citizens using this technology to communicate because it will be easier to control citizens when they dont use encryption. simple.
Also there will be a double standard.  The politicians and authorities will continue to encrypt all there comms but no one else by law will be allowed. And I honestly dont know who is more of a threat;  Politicians or terrorists?  This guy is a joke that cant be taken seriously.
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:01:05
we hate him because be stole 800k BTC and the fact he is completely incompentent
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:48:24
yeah im not convinced
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:47:35
yeah thats fine I can see the big picture however.  Im in no rush
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:13:23

@_date: 2015-01-14 06:44:30
whats the point?  i could sell out now but why?.  I believe in the protocol.
@_date: 2015-01-14 11:12:55
yeah fair enough.  Im mostly with you here.  The thing i struggle with is my lack of faith in the legal system.  I have a feeling he will take the fall for this no matter what but deep down I would not be surprised if one day he was found to be innocent.  everyone can be brought for a price.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:08:50
so you think they were set up buy the authorities?
@_date: 2015-01-11 08:56:43

@_date: 2015-01-19 22:13:08
yeah i left this comment there as well.

this is pretty damming stuff !!
@_date: 2016-03-16 23:43:06
i have had a trezor for a couple of years. (brought for 1btc during first presale)  it arrived and i had a little play with it.  I did not use it for a couple of years while i was consistently firing up the laminator to make paper wallets.  
I finially sat down one day and started to use it.  wow.  amazing.  basiacially my daily internet banking package.  Being able to lable address etc is grea.  there is some more thing i would like tresor to add to their software. (check out ledger wallet for slick UI and features!)  
@_date: 2015-01-17 20:57:15

Hey there are a few things (all software)
first being able to 'refresh' your transaction list (scan your addresses) i find some transactions come through an appear in the interface but sometimes I have to "Forget" the device and then plug it in again to refresh the transactions. (ledger has a 'refresh button that seems to function ok)
I like the way Ledger has this 2fa kind of thing with your mobile phone to broadcast transactions.  They you submit a transaction it pushes a notification to your mobile phone and you press a button on your phone to confirm the transaction.  (in reality i know know how much extra security this provides but it does make me feel a bit better.)
There have been a couple of times I have left my trezor plugged in and the next day its still on the trezor page all logged in.  I would like the ability to 'auto signout after 'n minutes' for example.
Also i would like to see the option to enforce a pin code for sending funds.  
I like the way on Ledger you can set a local currency. ( im aware you can see the value of a particular currency when you send BTC but this should be shown next to transactions as well. 
I dont find the trezor slower than the ledger?  its just different.  for me the screen is essential when storing large amounts of coin. ( ledger displays your seed on your computer - not ideal IMO)
Overall i feel more comfortable with my funds on the trezor. I only keep small amounts on the ledger ( loose change )
I can see the benifits of a trezor over a ledger but i think your software could be improved.
Any way thanks alot for making the device.  Also im in the market for a couple more but im hoping you guys have a new version in the pipeline.  (hopefully larger screen and just bigger in general)  
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:44:27
ummm yeah lets not...
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:57:01
torrent anyone?
@_date: 2016-03-16 22:24:05
the distrubted nature of this network would make it ideal for darknet markets, once they have addressed the annon issue.  Eg. tor and/or i2p.  
Yes options exist but they currently still have the centralization issue.

yeah but maybe that wont help the FEDS all that much?  Look at the TPB guys.  Everyone knows who they are but can the feds stop TPB/ ISOhunt/ kat etc etc?  lol nope. and this kind of platform is far more decentralised than TPB and other torrent trackers.  eg far more resilient IMO.  we will see....
@_date: 2016-06-15 04:41:10
i use btc all day every day and I have NO problem paying fees.  5-40 cent fee for an irreversible transaction is fine for most of us.  i see how it becomes problematic for microtransactions however.

ooooooo     yeah baby...  been waiting for a trezor compeditor, i have the nano but i wouldnt store more than a couple hundred bucks on that thing.
@_date: 2016-06-19 00:49:44

@_date: 2016-06-19 12:42:34
haha,  you really have no idea.
@_date: 2016-06-12 21:21:07
trezor security means it cant be compared with ledger.  trezor all the way.  you get what you pay for
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:29:20

buy a hardware wallet.  TREZOR
@_date: 2016-06-13 00:33:33
i aggree with everything you have said.  Diversification is the key and yes i myself still prefur bip-38 paper wallets for long term storage.  Im just saying i would feel more comfortable with many coins on a trezor vs ledger nano etc.
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:53:51
how much did these cost you if you dont mind me asking?
@_date: 2016-06-18 23:03:11

@_date: 2016-06-24 07:14:27
sweep and re-broadcast.  In this past week i have had a couple of transaction blocked yup also.  after a coupe of days the ended up arriving.  If you in a rush import your seed or private key and re-broadcast
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:57:51
Ledger is not as secure IMO.  I own both.  I use the trezor for most of my coins and only small amounts on the ledger.
The fact that the seed is displayed on the computer screen when your making a new ledger wallet makes it uncomparable.
i think you will find people with substantuial holdings would choose a trezor over ledger anyday.
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:58:15
for sure.  but it value will drop a LOT. i think
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:57:57
you should thank them for taking that shit off your hands
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:40:21
i got exactly the same :D

Basically the government should fuck right off and let the markets decide what to do..

@_date: 2016-12-19 17:38:47
who are you to say what is bad and what is good and what does that matter anyway ?
if its an interesting computer science idea and experiment well thats just what it is.  Just because some drug dealers choose to accept the currency does not make it any less interesting as a comp sci idea and experiment?  does it?
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:53:00
nope your wrong.  you need to wait for a confirmation..
bitsquare wont supply bank account info until there is 1 conf..
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:57:37
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:15:39
It’s called trading mate .....
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:54:18
yeah it 'should' . but there are many reasions why it might not be confirmed.  eg to small fee.
@_date: 2016-12-17 10:15:24
hurm interesting....  you will be right...
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:58:49
what a fucking nob.  really coinbase to cash out.   reallllyyyyyy.
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:55:00
yes your correct mate.  you need to wait until bitsquare provides you his bank account number. (after 1 conf)
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:28:37
so dope... im there in a few dayss.....
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:39:51

@_date: 2016-12-20 01:26:29
You deplore its use for scams and crimes... Your anger is misguided. There are FAR more scams and crimes committed with USD or any other fiat currency. Don't be angry at the tool be angry at the scammers and the criminals. It's like being angry at kitchen knives because some phycios use them to stab people. Its silly. 
And you just assuming it's more adiquate for scams etc than legitimate payments. I do not have  figures or evidence (like you do not) but I would be on the other side here. I would estimate the legitimate payments far outweigh the scams etc with btc. I feel your statement is pure FUD.
You say it's unusable as a currency.  Your wrong. There are so many of us that use it as a currency all the time, every day. It's far from unusable as a currency. Yes it can be volitile, but if you look at the history of btc this number decreases. The volitity is lowering .. I don't have evidence with me but I would guess there are many other nations currencys that are more volitile than btc has been in the last year.
You say it's bad for man kind. You say it's bad because it does not generate any wealth. Your wrong once again..  btc is an amazing technology that allows people to transact p2p Anyware In The world. It does not require a central authority to process this payment .  This is one benefit that makes it good for mankind and make it of value.  I'm not going to waste my time talking about other benefits as I know your aware of them.  Your not stupid I know this. But your arguements are so flawed it's like your trolling..
@_date: 2016-11-02 06:42:37
how do you work bot?  crazy..
@_date: 2016-12-20 11:24:59
what a fucking load of horse shit.....
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:31:45
I checked out the bitsquare project when they first launched.  as a LBC trader a could not see for how it was possible to trade safely with out the communication layer LBC has for fiat trades.  you need to be able to KNC in most countries for p2p trading to mitigate against fraud.
I used it for a large trade the other day for the first time with a trader I had already done KNC to.  worked fine.  had to pile a lot of trades together as there is a 1 btc trade limit.
its a lot more useful than expected.  I will be using this in the future and ill love when they take trade limits off or at least extend them..
@_date: 2016-12-17 09:53:43
the TX must not have confirmed on the block chain..
@_date: 2016-12-19 17:35:09
ah i see.  
Well if its anything like how you try to understand bitcoin you may as well give up now mate.... some elevators just dont go all the way to the top.....
@_date: 2016-12-19 01:08:04
So butt hurt.... Will you ever admit your wrong ?
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:55:14
A fair bit . I was buying the whole way up. I'm a trader. What is your point ?

haha haha
@_date: 2015-08-30 08:13:41
yeah nah thats ok . thanks though.  I use the paperbitcoinwallet.com i think.  you can upload you own designs there.
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:36:47
this is what i have done.  what are your thoughts on storing your bip38 private keys on some kind of online storage is that a no no ?
@_date: 2015-08-08 10:54:07
did you not read all the other random variables he threw into the mix?
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:18:10
should not encourage these bully fuck heads.  There is NO PLACE for regulation in BitCoin.!

what is that second one? thats not a paper wallet is it?
@_date: 2015-08-29 07:48:05
yeah multisig sounds good.  how can i found out more? can i have full control over this or do i need to use a service?
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:37:31
someone please ELI5 what the hell this is all about
@_date: 2019-12-22 19:51:19
your wrong, do some research
@_date: 2019-12-22 20:14:47
i have used it many times.  it has a built in wallet.  you hold custody of your coins all the time unless your partway though a trade and then btc are in a multisig wallet and you hold one of the three keys.  if the trade goes smoothy you and the other party on the opposite side of the trade can sign the multisig transaction to transfer the btc.  If there is an issue you can get an arbitrator involved and they hold the third key..

@_date: 2016-02-17 08:52:23

dont waste your time with LTC
@_date: 2016-09-20 22:14:08
i have never heard of this happening.  Ever.  This is why this fraud works so well.  If you pay the ransom they send you the decryption keys.  Its that simple.  I sell btc p2p and have sold coins to maybe 30+ poeople to pay ransoms. never heard from anyone that the ransom didnt work...
@_date: 2016-09-20 11:54:32
yeah its all good and well saying this but to most people paying the ransom is the only way.  Its Shit.  Im not condoning it at all but if hes being hit for 10 btc hes probability a business/ company and 10 bitcoins may be nothing compared to the data that encrypted.
@_date: 2016-09-16 12:33:20

@_date: 2017-09-20 13:42:53
you have to trust LP though..
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:06:01
This is what I was mostly worried about . Sounds like they have at least made an effort to prevent this from happening .
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:20:42
yes but i would not suggest using it right now until they have fixed their issues :
@_date: 2016-09-17 14:13:54

fucking garbage.
@_date: 2016-09-12 10:36:12
your fine. lol
@_date: 2016-09-25 12:31:04
i have been thinking this would be a cool application.  you could set it to watch your public address that you hold the priv keys for.  If the coins get sent to another address it would straight away double spend your coins to an another address you hold.( the idea is: if your private address has been compromised and the attacker attempts to send your coins to his address)  The problem i can see with this is the service / app is that it would need to have your private keys right ?  even if this was a feature built into your wallet etc. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:49:55
@_date: 2016-09-19 12:17:13
dude have you done the math.  ffs even paying 1% for this is fine is it not? use something thats established and trusted.  1% is 20k.  your talking about 2 mil here mate.  The only escrow people I would trust in this sceanero would be LBC.  pull the grass out of your pockets.  0.25% is chump change.  Im not doubting you will find someone that will claim to do this for you but would you want to ?

there is a new one on netflix : 'banking on bitcoin"
its very good
@_date: 2016-09-20 11:52:31
firstly he should at least try this site : 
also . depending on the type of ransomware he/ you should negotiate with these fuckers.  I have many clients that do this and most of the time it works.
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:35:33
i second this.  a hardware wallet like a trezor or a ledger nano s is the go for simplicity &amp; security
@_date: 2016-09-14 15:24:24
huh.  i had not thought of this.  it would be cool if it could generate your new passwords the way it generates new addresses.  Like a deterministc password manager.  I wonder if this is possible....
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:57:24
NZ is a small market and its hard to get coins here.  The banks are very anti bitcoin companies and traders and actively close bank accounts down.  There is a few exchanges however with super small liquidity and a few brokers like my self.
If your after larger amounts its best to source your coins from a larger exchange.  There is a few in Australia that are not to bad and you can trade on one of them with NZD.
if you have more questions feel free to reach out.

This is the banks problem.  Enough said.  We pay them to facilitate the trade of funds and they cant do it properly with out fucking it up.  The thing is, both partys are victims.  There is someone thats not even in the court room that needs to be held accountable for this crime.  
Its a hard one to protect yuour self from as a BTC seller. Most of the time these scam involve cash being deposited into your account. (not even a transfer)  the BTC seller should NOT be held responsible for this.  Judge judy has no idea.  Silly bitch
@_date: 2016-05-26 11:15:45
you say that but the current banking system is just not designed to deal with anonymous payments. Governments require more KNC and AML from the banks and it gets passed onto us.  I am a full time trader and I am constantly dealing with fraud related issues.  All BTC traders deal with these issues when trading p2p.  If anything this bit-square will enable fraud even more.  I aggree with you partners should not have to reveal their information but for fiat trades using the current banking system you need to have some KNC IMO.
@_date: 2015-10-03 04:21:29
DASH is the way to go for anonymization! Darksend all the way !
@_date: 2016-05-26 20:39:08
i get it how you say "Fraud makes no sense on bitsquare".  And I understand your ideals but im just saying in the real world this is not the ideal way to trade.  let me give you an example.
I want to sell some BTC.  I create a listing on bitsquare. Someone opens a trade with me.  Using the current bitsquare design i DONT have any way of 'verifying the legitimacy' of the customer the only next step of the process is for the customer to deposit funds into my account. They deposit money into my bank.  Great i can see it.  Its cleared funds.  I release coins to customer.
Then 1 week later the bank will phone me up and explain that a fraudulent payment has just entered my bank and that it is being reversed......  This is what happens in the real world to p2p bitcoin traders ever day.  
Unless the design is changed this will become a sess pool of scamming.  a hacker gets a list of bank account passwords.  using bitsquare rather than having to fully manufacture a heap of other indenity/verification papers etc to go with it they now need need to make a payment from any bank account they have access to.
Unless there is something im misunderstanding this is how the system will function.  Trust me.  It will get abused very quickly. (if it is not already) For this reason I have pulled all my for sale listing from bitsquare and only left my buying adds. ( buying is has very minimill risk, if your an honest actor).  But selling coins using this model is straight up reckless.(receiving random money into your account)
Im not trying to pick this project apart.  Im trying to provide some constructive criticism.  The way this is running, will not work for fiat trades using the current banking system.  It will  be abused.  LBC have a messaging system built in for a reason.
For alt coin/btc trades.  THIS IS PERFECT.  its the fiat part that WONT WORK.
These problems I have mentioned, dont get me started on them.  Its complete bull shit.  We pay the banks to facilitate the transfer of funds and they cant even do that with out fucking it up.  This should NOT be our problem. By law we are not required we collect all this information, but because we are still using this old outdated fiat banking system we all use we have to play by their rules.  And their rules say they do what they want.  reversals etc.  Even if they dont reverse the funds, this is still very problematic to a trader.  The bank account will get closed eventually.   The whole goal is to prevent fraud before it hits your account.  Catching it afterwards is not good enough.  Speak to any trader they will tell you this.

innocent until proven guilty
@_date: 2015-10-08 11:13:50
this explains it here.   
but basically you need a substantial holding of dash to run a masternode.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:15:04
@_date: 2016-05-26 11:19:04
may seem like that.  Its not.  I downloaded bitsquare on the launch day and have not looked at it since.  Today i finally checked it out.
@_date: 2015-10-18 00:52:49
yeah this is great.
@_date: 2015-10-19 09:36:02
I was wanting a price chart.  Are you suggesting making one myself? Hurm i dont know if i have the skills...

yeah everyone I tell about are sketipical.  I myself was a skeptic when i was first introduced to BTC.  after hours of research I started to like the idea.  Now after years I think its one of the most important inventions in the world.  i hear what your saying . 
@_date: 2016-05-25 00:06:26
its far more instant and final that any other payment method other than cash.  its 'instant' enough for me.  
@_date: 2016-05-25 23:50:13
yeah ok seems as though this has just changed from yesterday
@_date: 2015-10-08 11:41:45
yes of course.  you can keep your coin in cold storage when running nodes if you want ( i myself keep my node coins on encrypted paper wallets)  
the coins never have to be on the machine running the node.  Completely safe.  Did I mention masternodes earn 45% of the block reward :)
@_date: 2015-10-02 13:38:11


i have had this happen before.  about 20 hours after send coins to sharedsend they arrived at my intended destination.  How long ago did you do this?

you have no idea what your speaking about.  Some banks do have 2fa but not all and its not a compulsory feature to use.  Even with 2fa bank accounts still get drained when smart hackers spoof phone numbers etc (rendering sms 2fa useless)  You have clearly never traded btc p2p or you would know what im talking about (ask 99.95% of LBC traders and they will cement what im saying.  and you can sue them..  ffs just stop.

@_date: 2018-12-13 11:29:24
You say you improved it  and made it safer by eliminating the possibility of hacking if the attacker has physical access to the device . Can you explain ..
@_date: 2016-07-21 15:11:34
the reason this bull shit is spreading like a nasty STD is because of its MLM structure.  Makes me sick.  when this eventually comes out its a massive scam the idiot sheep &amp; mainstream media will point at BTC.

When you say this is the trezor are you using all the same parts ? Did you make the device your self or is it the guts from a trezor ?
Did you make the firmware your self ?
