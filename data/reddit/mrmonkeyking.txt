This, so much.  It is not Havelock's fault that your investments aren't turning up profit, it is simply the market.  The problem with Neo and Bee is  that there was a lot of bad news and publicity associated with it.  The CEO was suspected of embezzling funds and there was a lack of corporate transparency among other things.  This was ultimately the reason why Neo and Bee failed their shareholders.

I have no qualms with them. They have awesome support.  I am currently up and have been for about 8 months now.  I was at one point triple what I had invested.  It's like anything that's stock related; don't go into it if you don't know what you are doing.  It's not easy profit and you often times have to work at it.  If you are looking for quick gains, then I would advise against it.

I do a little bit of day trading.  Though it is not as intense as how my cousin day trades.  Yeah usually I look at the trend and put in an amount that I think it will sell at or an amount that I will buy at.  It a a lot like day trading with bitcoins and/or litecoins.  You just don't have to deal with the pesky fees.
My cousin is invested in 3 different stocks, I am only doing 1.
As they always advise in these sorts of situations, sell high buy low. But I am sure you know that already. Haha

I am not sure if I am understanding you fully or not, but it all just really depends on whether or not the IPO that you are buying from has units for sale or not.  
If there are units available, then you can buy at that price or you can simply sell at the original asking price. However, if there are no units available by the actual IPO, then what happens is you day trade by buying and selling at the ask and bid prices, respectively.  As such, depending on the IPO itself and how active the trading is, the price of the shares can fluctuate throughout the entire day.  For instance, earlier today for a certain IPO, the price of each share was listed at ฿0.00006231	, however it has since gone up to ฿0.00007750	 per share.
So yes, it can be a daily thing, but it can also be a "throughout the day" kind of thing depending on how you want to trade and how much "risk" you are willing to work with.
I'm sorry if I didn't answer your question or if I am not providing enough information.

Ah, understandable.  After all, to each their own.

That's what I was thinking.  I could totally see them packing a lowkey miner into their games.
