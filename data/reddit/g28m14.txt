I actually looked into buying some Eth a few weeks ago, which obviously would have been a good idea with the benefit of hindsight. While I regret not making the profit, I don't think I can honestly regret not making the investment. I say that because I've always believed in only investing in things I understand, and I simply don't understand Eth. 
It is definitely possible I'm just uninformed or too dumb to get it, but when I tried to research Eth all the information I found was buzzwords and predictions of future potential. I don't doubt the technology could be useful, but it seems like so far the practical application is unrealized.
This could be horrible advice though as I also missed most of the early bitcoin profits due to my hesitance to get involved. Until recently, I wasn't convinced of the staying power of bitcoin. I think I made the prudent decision, but I certainly didn't make the most profitable one.
So yea, tl;dr, I'm not sold on the hype yet. Congrats to those of you who've made a profit though.

Piggy backing on this... so I know generally speaking, keeping coins in an exchange is considered a bad idea. I generally transfer mine to cold storage once I reach a particular threshold. That being said, with how large it seems coinbase is, is there really that much risk of losing funds considering they seem to be well established and located in the US? I never keep more than maybe $1000 there, so nothing that would ruin me financially if I did lose it.
I guess my question is what is the consensus regarding risk associated with coinbase? Just due to their size and pressence in the market, it seems like they're a pretty safe bet from my perspective.

In the past 30 days the price on GDAX has increased 83%, so at the current 30 day avg, slightly more than a month. However, the past 30 days have not been normal. No oe can say for sure. Could be less than 30 days, could be a year, could be never.

Zero hedge definitely has a penchant for peddling fear, especially in the last few years, but I think they also cover a lot of legit stories before the MSM does. Like all new sources, they should be read with a healthy dose of skepticism, but not dismissed completely.

Yeah! They also haven't leaked information about Pence, Lance Armstrong, Michael Jackson, my asshole neighbor, the amount of actual meat in taco bell 'meat', or the fact that jews control how fast trees grow, for some reason. 
Obviously they're just in the pocket of 'Big asshole neighbors'. Quit mowing your lawn at 8am Gary, its the weekend! /s

Did you get the message saying your tx was added? I had to try ~20ish times before I got an accept message as oppose to the one saying their queue was full. Had to do it on 2 transactions I made before educating myself on the scaling/fee issue, and both were confirmed with 30 mins of getting accepted by the accelerator.
