You buy crypto send it through monero a few times and claim you lost money on bad trades, private key stolen etc..
There’s no way to prove what happened to your crypto after monero made it disappear from your personal identifiable wallet

Surged a lot higher than I expected so it only retraced to 5500 instead of 4500 but even then he could have sold at 6000-7500 and still increased his stack 15-25% which is a nice increase on 6 figures +

This dude is retarded. Go look at his reply to me as to why he doesn’t need evidence to support his claims on the internet. Lmao
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:24:13
You’re a theoretical genius, huh? A few people would disagree and say they did prove you wrong. 
Also I would say you never proved to me that what you were saying even made any factual sense. I’m sure plenty others would agree.

That’s crazy. $50 million in a landfill. I wonder how many other have lost thousands of BTC

Consumers wouldn’t be thrilled if they didn’t have options. It’s beneficial for the ecosystem if multiple cryptos coexist. 
BTC and BCH are both extremely outdated and useless tech at this point anyways. BTC will survive as long as it’s the default trading pair for everything. You can trade ETH against most alts anyways, but they have problems of their own as well. Newer tech but with that came way more problems 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:01:28
I mean you sound like you know what you’re talking about. But if I were truly an idiot, then I would believe you without proof. Words aren’t proof and neither are condescending insults over the internet.

Jesus you can’t be this stupid. How can you honestly make that argument and not see the flaws? 
I never claimed I wasn’t a thief. You can call me a thief all you want though. Whether I am or not isn’t relevant because I never made the claim I was. You did say you work at a bank as evidence to back up knowing more than the other fellow about a subject. 
This is you right now (you’re guy 1, he’s 2, I’m 3)
Guy 1: I know more than you 
Guy 2: No you don’t 
Guy 1: Yes I do because I work at a bank
Guy 2: Okay prove you work at a bank
Guy 3: Yeah I want to see you prove it also
Guy 1: I don’t have to prove anything. I’m right I work at a bank believe me. 
Guy 2: Okay I work at your moms house and fucked your mom. See how that works? 
Guy 3: Yeah and I work at the hospital and records show you were molested by your uncle multiple times. 
*This is where we currently are and you responded*
Guy 1: You are both stupid. I work at a bank. That should be enough to make you believe me. You’re both patronizing me. I know everything and you guys are stupid. You’re both thieves. See how that works?
No bitch that’s not how this works. We aren’t making professional claims to back up our knowledge and not proving ourselves. Go fuck yourself dumbass. I hope this made it easier for your small mind to understand. How’s that for civilized asshole? Your mother is a whore 
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:38:49
Looking for the proof that you work at a bank because that’s all I ever came for. You never showed me anything 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:59:59
Still no evidence to back up your claims. 
Still your mother is a whore.

Keep an eye out for more retracing. It’s very hard to determine what’s going to happen with BTC at this point. Nobody knows what’s going on with BCH or segwitx2. So until that gets figured out I would recommend safer bets like LTC/ETH or even USDT..
Honestly snagging some alts wouldn’t be bad either but I see most dropping more in the coming weeks before a huge bull run in late 2017/early 2018
Biggest coins to watch for the next 6-12 months:
There are definitely a few more but these are all solving real problems that need to be solved in order for the crypto community to flourish. I’m extremely, extremely bullish onVTC for the next 6 months. Tezos and LINK should get huge in the next year

Is your ad hominem argument finished now? Can we address the issue of whether or not $400 M BTC can easily be bought in a multi hundred billion dollar market that moves billions each and every day? The volume very much so is indicative of buying/selling more so than any other metric. You’re reaching for straws. People rarely use BTC other than for buys/sells. Tx fees are so so it’s not like people are moving it around willy nilly

Trying to attack her by telling her multiple times she has a bright future? Baiting her by targeting young devs for longevity and fresh intuition? 
Didn’t realize seeing great dev work by a young person and reaching out to them qualifies as baiting and attacking. You sound like a white knight

He kicked himself by asking for handouts on a public forum while simultaneously saying he didn’t want “fish” just a “pole” then proceeded to say he’s tired of filling applications(pole) and just wants the handout for pocket money and to save (fish). He’s hypocritical and wonders why he’s down on his luck. He’s not honest with himself. Don’t fall victim to the victims game. Been around it my whole life. The guy is a joke and needs to grow up. His mindset is childish. 
How can you be homeless and say you’re tired of filling out applications and then ask for money on a public forum and not expect this reaction? Lmao 
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:54:52
I know how market cap works bro. It’s still a multi hundred billion dollar market. It’s not like other coins with bs pre mines and fake market caps. BTC market cap is the only legit one. If that’s not convincing enough, then just look at 24 hr volume. $400 M would get eaten up in a few hours dude. A few days or more of accumulating and nobody would notice that drop in the bucket
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:22:48
Look I’m just posting the screenshot. I offered her paid work and she didn’t even inquire about more info which to me was initially weird. I didn’t understand how a 16 year old would go through all that work for a $0.99 app but would even ask about more info on offered paid work. 
This is just another piece of evidence that she most likely does not know how to program or develop software. She brought this all on herself

Because HBSC is the bank of cartels and is basically untouchable by governments. They already tried sanctioning them for money laundering. They paid their dues and got right back on the horse. I watched the doc and immediately decided that’s my new bank for crypto withdrawals

Netflix documentary called “Dirty Money” episode 4 I believe. Just watch all 5 honestly. It’s a good series about corporate corruption. 
After that I highly recommend “Water and Power: A California Heist.” This is corruption in the highest form and the direction mankind will be headed if we do not decentralize everything and fast

See I was talking to my girlfriend and came up with this idea. Apply for every credit card and loan you can get and max everything out to buy crypto. After a while just don't pay anything off and file for bankruptcy. Now your debt is erased. In 7 years the bankruptcy filing with be off your credit too. Plus you have 10s of thousands of free dollars in crypto now. Makes sense or were we too high?

$400 M bought during a crash most definitely would not send to new highs. It wouldn’t even create decent support. 
You can’t be this ignorant to believe $400 M would send a multi hundred billion market to new highs during a crash. Cmon bro use logic please 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:37:37
Yes, that’s what I initially assumed. Even then, it would always be smart to at least see if the project offering you work is more worth your time. 
I also made this offer within hours of her posting the app before it blew up everywhere. I don’t know any 16 year old devs so overloaded with work that they don’t even check into a project offering them paid work. Also, if she had such great work on her plate already she wouldn’t have spent all that time developing a $0.99 app that has already been developed hundreds of times by others. It didn’t initially make much sense, but now it does

You want a donation so you have have pocket money and save up? Maybe open a dumb cleaning business because one guy on here keeps posting his dumb threads every week about his business to get his name out there? You’re dead tired of filling applications? What’s a joke. You say you’re not asking for fish, just a pole. Applications and a job are the fishing pole. Money is the fish. You’re moronic way of thinking is probably why you’re homeless and unemployed. Grow up
