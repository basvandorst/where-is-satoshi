What I had in mind is, after X (adjust accordingly) years you can stop paying into one of them and contribute to the one that remains suitable. Also, from what I know most of CTF's are meant to be untouchable until the child gets to adult age so 10 years doesn't seem to be that bad. Also it would stop you from tinkering with it, as people are often tempted when the price spike arrives. I am sure you will find a way :)
EDIT: I would also assume in next 10 years if bitcoin still exist you probably be able to merge your funds or some of the funds in his portfolio will be speculating with bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:06:05
The fact you are not incorporated doesn't mean it's not a business :)
The what goes where bit would require some custom development I am affraid and you would have to rely on users submitting additional parameters with their transaction and I'm not sure it can be done easily.
Other option would involve bitcoin address creation when the delivery address is submited, probably a bit harder to do but better user experience. Once the shipment details have been confirmed the script would generate a new address and present/email the address to the client. This way you could ensure you keep track of who paid and who didn't and only send your goods to the addresses with positive balances.

The way I'd like to think about it simply - Bitcoin will succeed when we stop talking about it. Not many people talk about TCP/IP these days and when you think about it the internet of today is built on it. And it even works :)
As for btctrans.it if you play with it for a moment (look for example at CNY &gt; CHF exchange rates) to see where such solution might be quite useful. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:23:00
Glad you like it. You have some valid points and we have been thinking on expanding on the idea, and as the holiday season is over hopefully we will be able to focus on it a bit more, as this is just a small side project at the moment :)
@_date: 2014-07-10 10:03:52
I'm glad I'm not the only one to point it out :)

Shame the title doesn't stop here "SFU becomes first Canadian university to accept Bitcoin"  - that would be much better news. As for donations, they are nice to have and the fact somebody accepts them, well I do accept donation 24/7 but this won't make to the front page :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 19:39:26
Bitcoin has many use cases, even if we only focus on bitcoin-currency. Some people travel a lot and in some cases it's quite convenient for them to actually trade them for particular fiat during the travel due to exchange fee differences. We have built small tool to highlight these differences at  - and in fact I have been trading bitcoins in three different countries as usual exchange rates were far smaller than what I got by trading bitcoins. It does require a bit of preparation but if somebody has the time and resources to do so, they can actually benefit from it :)
Also, every day people find new use cases for bitcoin in general, and in couple of years time early addoption problems will simply go away (why would i need internet if I can watch news on TV - I hear echoes from 1996).
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:21:58
Nice to hear, thank you ;)
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:46:59
Well, if I remember correctly, gold/silver/fiat then alcohol/petrol are much better currency. Also, if the whole network is down, wouldn't it make it quite risky investments to swap say paper wallets? With physical goods it's something that you can attach value 'now' - with bitcoin, it would only be valid if/when the network is back on and people can redeem the coins - provided they are still there (as there is no way to check). And even if they were still there you could quickly move them somewhere else before another person tries to claim it.
Also - diversify your portfolio :) It would be worth to have some fiat available to trade for food and water in the short term.
Now when I think about it... I would actually watch that movie :)
@_date: 2014-05-06 12:36:32
Personally I would not want to associate Bitcoin logo with the image in  section on the page you have provided.

We were interested recently how does standard fiat exchange compare to bitcoin trading so we created this small utility. Maybe you will find it useful too.
@_date: 2014-09-10 12:30:37
Not that I am aware of, but we were looking into viability of such task and came with small utility that can be useful to see if such transfer would be better of than going through exchange rates:

The problem is - you can't make first impression for the second time. Why not wait couple of days and launch the website properly? By rushing things I don't think you have done yourself any favours really.
@_date: 2014-09-15 10:40:01
From your 'about' page:
"What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency that began in 2009 and became mainstream last year when prices hit an all-time high of over $1200 per bitcoin." 
Somehow, you did not answer the question there if you ask me. 
Also, wix, gmail - I have nothing agains these services but if you want to promote your revolutionary product, dedicated web and email domain and some branding touch is a must these days. Otherwise people might look at it and simply say "meh" and never come back.
Just my 2 bits.

At the end of the day if I was a potential customer I would hesitate buying from you if I saw this conversation. When you look from your customers point of view they want to feel they are having good experience and what they are doing business with legitimate entity. So, when you think about it maybe it's worth to invest and do it properly as a merchant? I am afraid that 'cheap and easy' does not always apply in today's world - you simply will need to spend money in order to make money :) Good luck with your "non business" business anyway.
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:24:51
What you are describing is pure greed I believe, also if you were to travel from the future why not to travel to 2009 instead and mine bitcoins for few months? :) That would be even better ROI :)
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:08:01
How about you set up fiat one and bitcoin one - fiat being a fund as we know it today, bitcoin - say offline wallet. After 10 years you will probably have an idea of which one is performing better and focus on such accordingly. This also will diversify you son's portfolio.

I would not think there is definitive answer to that. If today we use Bitcoin to solve problem A, tomorrow we will find problem B and so on. The innovation is out there but I think what is stopping people from going full monty is the lack of addequate guidelines so people/businesses have something to relate to. I personally have experienced people willing to give it a go (accepting cryptos in their online stores) but they don't want to risk their businesses due to inaddequate guidelines for them to operate in this new realm.
It would be nice to bookmark this thread and revisit it every few months to check what sort of use cases have been missing at the time.

I remember the hurdles of installing linux using floppy boot disk and then faffing around here and there to get it prompt at you. Now I look at live CDs where you can simply test drive it before installing everything and in most cases (at least for me) it provides me with the software I use on daily basis. There is still a lot of room for an improvement but I'd like to think of Bitcoin now as a bootable floppy moving towards live CDs any year now...

If Netflix gets serious about bitcoin amazon might respond with support in lovefilm, which could be a test drive if they were interested in Bitcoin at all. I wouldn't be surprised if amazon owned companies start to accept Bitcoin before the shopping site considders it.

@_date: 2014-08-28 13:45:04
I believe this is business if you offer value/goods for money.
The simplest way to do it would be to set up a wallet and post an address people would transfer money to, but you would then have to handle what goes where etc, which from technical point should not be much difficult (I suppose people submit the form with delivery addres, the form generates unique reference and then you request them to put the reference into a transaction so you can track it down).

My only worry is that these things, although neat in it's own right, disconnect from the security Bitcoin provides which is the network to verify what is a valid 'coin' - which makes it a great tool to scam people, especially if this is the first time they are introduced to Bitcoin

This, but also it was more about the fact that the printed media got some coverage, which was out of date by the time of reading :)
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:44:01
Which is all fine, but one needs to know all that. If however one is new to the experience of Bitcoin, that will not be the case. So what if somebody was to print public key pointing to say 0.1 and have all the seals erc,  but underneath there would be private key of another, empty address? At first glance it would look perfectly valid and people could fall for it.

No problem. I would recommend to sit down with pen and paper first and draw what you actually want to do. I know it's 'faster' to just click away happily, but you need to think about people who will be attracted to your website. Keep it simple but informative, use colours (black and white does not count really). Explain what and why are you doing it. Maybe have F.A.Q. section so confused people can search for some clarification, that sort of thing :) 
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:11:45
I know they are, but that was not my point really. Anyway, good luck with the banners.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:38:47
I am just hoping they will not follow the footsteps of their current predecessors. What I mean by that is, the wealth changes people - I'm just hoping being able to experience slightly different path of life will not make them as much greedy. Time will tell...
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:35:26
You can add "I was here" to a transaction and this will stay in the blockchain until the blockchain itself dies and Bitcoin with it, whereas here I would need to rely on 3rd parties for the banner to be maintained and hosted.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:04:08
I think the idea itself is good, but it can be quite problematic to implement. The problem I see is the fact you want to advertise this as "scam free", but you can't really guarantee it. Besides, there could be the case, where scammers will behave in legitimate way for some time to get their perfect mark, or lure more customers in and then boom. Next day, there is only an 'sincere apology' on their website, but damage has been done. The only way it would work is to form or use existing 'Ring of Trust' and build on top of that.
Also, I know it's early stages, but I would think the website itself needs more substance and content to it, maybe more description of what, why and how? Say If I randomly clicked on this link in google search , what would I think the website actually provide? The first thing that comes to mind would be top 100 Bitcoin related businesses - and then, there are no major players there so... confusion...
EDIT: and why would you use frames where the source actually points somewhere else? (
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:35:36

As I said, you would have to experience living under such regime to understand what fears people might have. I remember when owning foreign currency was not disallowed, but if any of your neighbours colleagues would notice (and report) this you might for example struggle at work, be expelled from local club etc. I know it sounds mad when you think about it but unfortunatelly the regime "controlls" a lot of different parts of daily life.

How about using name not containing any reference to bitcoin? At the end of the day if you look at names like amazon, ebay, google, yahoo etc - there is not much reference to what they do, otherwise we would be using services like letmesearchthisforyouveryquicklyandreturnlistofresultsithinkwillmatch.com or iwillquicklysendyouremailtothepersonyouwantedandshowyousomeadsintheprocess.com
Also from creative point of view it's much easier to create much more creative branding.
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:41:52
Have you tried to send money via Bitcoin? Transfering them yes, easy. But on the receiving end there are still challenges to be overcome, so we are not there yet. I would hope in near future for less restrictions for companies to actually set up exchanges and allow conversion to fiat on the both ends of the transfer. This will then advertise itself as another option to try out, but at the end of the day some people will be still more comfortable with the way 'they always did it' and we can't force them to do otherwise.

It's too early to say really. It's a bit similar to 'what is this silly Internet thingy' few years ago. It started off like this but it can transfirm into whatever the users will want it to.

You have to remember Bitcoin introduces a concept - different way of thinking. It is one of the first crypto currencies but it won't be the last. It's a digital playground, where people can test ideas, and improve. And I believe they will improve. In 10 years time there might be much simpler, more suitable set of crypto currencies to tackle specific problems and they will be used on a daily basis. And as for the role of Bitcoin, it might fade away as the protocol/medium and become more of the 'Faberge Egg'... which I wouldn't mind :)

Amazon is not only the website. You need to split it into separate chunks and then you will see, the power of amazon in fact is logistics. And this is a challenge to build and manage such vast network. As for Bitcoins, it might get to this point but it won't happen any time soon.

I'm not sure if this is actually good or bad PR for Bitcoin :)

Another thing you could do is to get together with merchants and set up a deal, whereby people would buy stuff from them (provided it will help of course) for BTC and merchants would send these so you can organize the shipment (or whatever you do with it). This way you don't take BTC yourself (which I think people have problems with) and still everybody is a winner.

coinmap.org comes to mind really. As for 'protecting' newbies - I've got the weird feeling that these days people do not pay enough attention to what are they doing. Is it hype, laziness, mix of the two? There always be the way to scam people. "You can't cheat an honest man" generally works, but people get creative and you can't be 100% safe. I'm not sure 'Health and Safety' measures can always protect people from doing things wrong and learning the hard way( all these bruises of climbing trees in the early days). Maybe it would be better not to provide such false safety net so people actually think and take precautions when dealing with money.

And I hope you succeed. At the moment your website needs to convince people to provide you with details of their businesses and I believe you might need to improve the quality of it (which should be ok as it's very early stages as you mentioned). Keep in mind people will put reputation of their business in your hands and this might be the difficult part. Anyway, when I feel comfortable enough to put my company's profile there you will be the first to know :)

What would be the point of speculating if you knew what the market will do? We make our decisions, take the risk and face the consequences. Hesitation is a bad advisor, tos a coin - that helps making decisions a lot! :)
EDIT: Maybe you can consider providing services for Bitcoin - this way you get them (psychologically feels better if you didn't have to spend the money from the wallet) and will be supporting the whole thing at the same time.

How would you validate if the posted link is a scam?
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:20:08
Do some more research on the subject. If you don't feel comfortable doing it, simply don't. I'd start with asking yourself what can Bitcoin do for you and follow up on the answer really. Bitcoin is a broad topic in general.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:08:47
Exactly the same I'm affraid

acquire some knowledge on Bitcoin and then decide what's best

I would think it's a mix of "Dave said it's crashing", reading headlines only (in some cases misleading) and general excitement about the whole thing.
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:52:25
True and I think they will be using Bitcoins unaware of the fact faster than by choice - as a protocol rather than currency. But the only way to find out is just to wait really :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:18:32
Before I donate anything I am interested in how the money (or goods) will be spent. I do prefer to donate for specific purpose and not in general. We did have a lot of 'charity donations' articles in the past few days so if you want to do it properly you will have to be very careful, as people are a bit tired of 'yet another donation pledge'. Having said that it would be nice to see if you can show on your website what is that you are doing there and any past achievements.

Can't you use blockchain for free to do this in a way?
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:32:58
There is also a chance that because of what Bitcoin is and how it works it could promote different ways of looking at spending in general. I do agree loans are helpful and important, but maybe more people would start thinking if they can actually afford the loan in the first place. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:40:48
What is the purpose of the purchase? If you want to use them to send money abroad time/price shouldn't really matter, as you will be using bitcoin as a protocol/medium to do the transaction. As for 'investment' it's never a good time to buy as you can't predict what the price will be tomorrow, so I'd say buy now, store it and come back to it in 5 years. Hope it helps.

I don't think you should 'persuade'. Explain yes, demonstrate - by all means, but persuade? No. They need to make their own decisions. I hope I have persuaded you :)

First time I have learned about Bitcoins was when I was looking for stuff on  sf.net and Bitcoin was project of the month. At this time somebody (don't remember who) was giving away 0.5BTC just to get people going (I think it was some forum). The price at the time was around 0.25 and it was more of a proof of concept than the real thing really so it could have been between 2010-2011. If only I didn't ignore it for the next 2 years ;P 
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:52:57
Let's hope she didn't want Bitcoin for Christmas :P

Toss the coin if you can't decide. I used to have some in 2010 but abandoned them as it was too early and there was nothing at the time of interest. I only found out about Bitcoin from sf.net 'project of the month'. Now when I think about it, it's a pity but it was my decision and my consequences. And this applies to you now - try to work out what Bitcoin is for you and what do you expect from it. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:37:32
I would think, when most of us hit the 'grandma' age. The technology will evolve to become more and more usable, but this is a long way from now. Think about internet - does she use it now? It's there, it's available but I sill see a lot of 'grandmas' who are simply not interested, and don't really want to be involved.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:51:25
Maybe apple forum will be better place to post that? As it seems, Apple knows best (and they always did) so it's their way or the highway. Choice is yours really.

So if the value of Bitcoin today would be still 0.00 how would this affect your situation? Think about it, a lot of people have made decisions they made. Get over it, work hard and build up slowly. That's what most people do anyway.

There will always be a group of 'I told you so' people no matter where the Bitcoin goes :)

So how would you use *coins if you have received any? Are there any specific needs that need to be addressed or is it just random collection? We have seen all sorts of pledges and donation options in recent days for me the info you have provided is not enough to donate, sorry.

It's more to do with 'first impression' factor. I have nothing against the framework and it's quite effective way of prototyping, but when you hit the market it can make the difference if you are presenting a solution pleasing the eye at the same time.
