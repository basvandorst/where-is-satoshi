I used Poloniex two or three times and it was OK. 
Someone else may know more about the company and its players, but its probably safe to assume that they will turn on their customers when there is blood in the water - just like any other exchange, bank or financial institution will do. Possibly only because it is in their nature (remember the toad and the scorpion?) and the distant anonymity of online business makes it easier to do?
Since we're talking around the topic of Bitfinex, I guess my opinion is that there is no safe cryptocurrency (or fiat) exchange. Actually, come to think about it, I reckon there is less chance of being ripped off by a fiat exchange or precious metals dealer, since they are entrenched, insured and operate under much regulation and several watchdogs.

Nice rant :) 
Of course, i didn't imply any of the extremes you list, but that's not the point of a internet forum freak-out. 
I believe that other implementations of the Satoshi (Core) client are vital for the Bitcoin protocol's health and diversity. This is why I've tried several and continuously develop my own mini-me attempt. Yet, when an implementation is a carbon copy (Github codebase fork) of the Core client and is only a renegade developer (a la Hearn/Andresen) vehicle to hi-jack the Bitcoin blockchain and its supercomputer, then I agree with Satoshi: those pretend-Bitcoin client (and teams) can vanish like a sucked-up noodle for all i care.
VCs must fund and as many developers must be put to productive use. Bitcoin Core, however, will always remain the official Satoshi reference client. It is the team he started and to whom he handed his code and ethos. They are expected to maintain it, while other teams and project do not necessarily have this responsibility.
Within the Core team there is an easy approach to consensus. Changes are made according to "majority agreement" or they are not made at all. It was only the faction represented by Andresen and Hearn (and their VC "Bitcoin Judas" Ver) that introduces in-fighting, toxicity, and lots of noise.
It doesn't matter in the end, because even when there were clear pathways for those who wanted to run big blocks, only a little handful ran XT, then Classic and, critically, no miners followed suit, so those teams, their efforts and the idea that birthed those projects was the scene of a still-birth.
As a trader, since before Bitcoin existed and traded, I believe that Market manipulation is a normal and inevitable feature of markets. Just like sharks and riptides are a normal part of swimming in the sea.
And yes, I believe - from their credentials and work - that some of the best computer science minds on the planet are gathered around Bitcoin. Not around Litecoin or Ethereum, but around Bitcoin, and they can be found in and around the Core project.

I don't understand much of anything, especially the way some exchanges bamboozle retail traders with orderbook data derivatives and complex lending features.
Some simple things, I understand with more clarity than most: like when to trade and when not to trade. The winning formula is to hold back on your bet until the last moment: don't place a bet when someone forecasts rain. Don't bet when the clouds start to gather. Don't bet when you see thunder and hear lightning. Only bet on rain when the first drops start to fall. Unlike with roulette, the open market does not have an "all bets are off" imposed barrier on timing.
Can you see from this perspective, that the underlying orderbook depth and workings of margin/lending does not influence the decision to open a position?
Perhaps we're talking about different types of margin. I'm talking about vanilla CFD margin: I put down margin collateral to buy however many futures contracts (whether long or short) at leverage. There is a fee for opening the position but no interest. 
Are you perhaps referring to the spot market lending instruments that some exchanges offer? With those, despite there being plenty of room for manipulation, there is nothing that prevents a trader from taking irrational action: either by mistake, or in sheer desperation - no matter how ridiculous the offer or its terms, right?

exactly, its the stuttering admission of 


then the fast talking 


and the final 


Hmmm, so the final statement should lay our concerns about the first statement to rest...
While I had the misfortune of trading at Bitfinex, I realized that while they offered margin facilities, they did not have the incumbent mechanisms to control price during margin calls. So it was frequent price spikes and high risk for mismatched reward at 2.5:1 leverage at that time.

I see what you're implying, but also consider that this is normal in markets - low volatility (flat market) precedes a volatility ramp-up (strong directional moves).
Given the bearish technical indications, the market was going to sell-off eventually, hack or no hack. I'd say the timing of the hack during an ongoing large decline was coincidental. If news travels that fast, then it may have been a catalyst, to spur some traders, who were going to sell anyway, to action.
If it is true that the hacker (group) heisted the bitcoin from Bitfinex to trade it at OKCoin, then that makes for an interesting investigation. What I'm saying is that if the hacker (group) didn't use those coins to short-sell the market then the original owners would have anyway, because the market was in the middle of a decline at the time.
Just for what its worth, when I heard about the hack at Bitfinex, it didn't prompt me to go sell at OKCoin because I needed my funds in BTC to short the ongoing decline. If I had an account at Bitfinex, well, then I'd sell and get my coins out of there, but I did that years ago because Bitfinex's offer and practice are not to my liking.

Trading an instrument with knowledge of the instrument's orderbook is known as "insider trading" and it allows the lucky perp all sorts of advantages, like "front running" the market, to take advantages of margin liquidations, etc. It has gotten many traders time in jail.

Markets go up and down. Two trading consortia I belong to saw, 3 weeks ago, convincing technical reason to **short bitcoin price** heavily.
* A day before the hack, the technical factors in favor of shorting became compelling and we increased our positions. 
* This must have been the case across the market - especially amongst **whales** - who *out-wallet the hacker and the rest of the retail sector combined*. 
* There's a *time for buying and a time for selling* - they alternate, and this was a selling event that redoubled as a **shorting opportunity**. 
* OKCoin is a good platform for short selling, hence the large positions and participation there during declines.
The actual **reason for the decline** is more simple and comically human:

People are amazing: all the stages of grief are here on this page.
Some have completed the process and are moving on... 
My concern with Bitfinex, even 3 years ago, has always been *incompetence* and that's why I took my bitcoins and left.
Yes, their website looks polished (a web designer is paid to present the service), yes, they have impressive documentation that boggles the mind as it describes their unnecessarily complex margin and lending rules and caveats... 
But consider that the Bitfinex shopfront is a small-time operation when compared to large Wall Street investment banks, like Goldman Sachs, who also dazzle and impress in order to get customers to part with their money. And even with all that dazzle and display of credibility, Goldman Sachs still manages to lose client funds through bad investments and high-risk play. Perhaps BitGo was a bad investment. Perhaps BitGo was a sound investment that was negligently implemented, making it a high-risk play that ended up scoring an own-goal?
The Bitfinex CSO Potter was fired (as a trader) from Wall Street investment bank, JPMorgan, after becoming too exuberant during a 90s New York Times interview (this was covered in a post last week). Several years ago, when I asked Bitfinex some ordinary questions about how their underlying position and margin calculations are applied, I was told, by "Raphael, Bitfinex CTO" that it was "secret" information. I checked up on the exchange platform design and found this: (the guy with the raccoon on his head coded the Bitfinex exchange platform)
The platform is coded in Ruby on Rails - good for a website content engine - but, as an interpreted programming language, certainly not up to the task of handling the load of a production exchange with heavy volume and mission-critical security requirements.
The list goes on, yet the fact is there are exchanges out there that have NOT been hacked once (that we know about, admittedly) in the same period that Bitfinex has been hacked multiple times, had their tickers stop, had their knickers twisted, charts spike on uncontrolled margin liquidations, and all kinds of drama. There are exchanges out there with more advanced APIs, faster customer service and a wider array of services and facilities, including lower fees and higher leverage than Bitfinex.

 I warn you, don't engage me in argument. I speak on behalf of many. It's not a fair contest because we are many and you are one plus a few tasked managers. We can give you a public hiding and exhaust your management's minds on reddit.
First off, denying the information I relay is not a convincing whitewash of articles published far and wide across the internet - anyone who cares to check a search engine can find that YOU are the one parroting misinformation, passed down from a somebody above your head. The public can see and knows that.
A chatroom discussion earlier concluded that:
Bitfinex's reputation was permanently stained long ago by the CSO Potter saga. Recent events have exacerbated the state of affairs for Bitfinex - all trust is destroyed - and Bitfinex has no credibility left. Zane, you're defending the indefensible - the pariah - and what will you get in exchange for your good intention and harrowing work as a young man? 
Bitfinex, when they've been through proceedings, won't be an employer anymore, Zane. You have talent and valuable experience - good for employment elsewhere. Tell your boss he can stick it, and start a new more pleasant career for yourself. Something you can feel proud of and wake up to without worry. Tell your boss to step up to the line he's been pushing you to, so he can face the mob at the gates.
Let Bitfinex management make their own reddit accounts and not hide behind a young man who neither knows the facts nor has the intellectual toolkit to engage grown men or an angry mob. Most of the Bitcoin ecosystem, including academics and developers, read these pages. The mainstream media are, of course, starting to report on this scandal. Who handles Bitfinex's PR and customer relations in Bitcoin's most popular social forum? Are you really willing to send out a boy to do a man's job?

So, in this case, perhaps the dilemma/potential of fractional reserve highlights the need for a standard set of metrics that L2 users can request from L2 nodes - standardized so that they have easily referenced meaning and can be aggregated by third parties to show which L2 networks are healthiest; most liquid; settlement schedules/amounts; settlement errors, etc

running a fullnode is the most secure way of validating your own transactions. 
you can run a pruning Bitcoin Core fullnode whereby you specify how many GB of the blockchain (closest to the tip) you want to keep on disk. It will download the entire blockchain from other nodes, but never store more than you specify via -prune.
You can use the Core wallet and query the blockchain via Core restful API calls, RPC or get ZeroMQ published straight to your app. You get the benefit of validating your own transactions, as well as not being dependent on any 3rd party.

lol. There's this new thing called the "intraweb", you can find all kinds of things to read on it. But this kind of thing is not something I read about just now - I was alive and trading at Bitfinex when this kind of thing first happened. It was a Big Deal and we discussed it in dismay at the time because insider trading is a crime, since it shafts all the exchange's traders who don't expect the exchange to trade against them, or someone from that exchange to be in the same market if they have a privileged meta view of the orderbook. 
What you, Zane, are euphemistically calling "this kind of thing" is called a Conflict of Interests and a potential quagmire if investigated.
So, yes, the intrawebs. Please don't give me search engine work that you can easily go do for yourself.

i politely disagree, neither me nor any of the traders I speak with sell because of the brainwaves of the minority cults: we're selling because MACD has crossed below its zero line (mainly, and including other indications).
Now, when I say "sell", I don't mean sell actual bitcoin, but buying short contracts *with bitcoin*. So, a lot of large traders actually buy more bitcoin when technical decline becomes evident in order to short the exchange later - as in now.
The positive of this market trend is that it allows many ordinary buyers to buy bitcoin for cheaper, as well as that it creates the harmonic momentum in the price chart that eventually catapults bitcoin's amazing rallies.

It seems you use the terms "Free trade" without properly understanding its meaning and context correctly. If you're a capitalist then "Free Trade" is your thing and international law has your back. If you're in opposition to capitalism and its debt instrument, fiat, then you're opposed to the "free trade" that's been the vogue for 400 years. 
Is there perhaps ambiguity between "free trade" and "freedom to trade" outside of sanctions and regulation? Just trying to understand the meaning being referenced here...
@_date: 2016-08-13 04:50:18
ok, my understanding is closer to what you meant in your first post now.
so, you're talking about a means of enforcing immutability (via the locktimed "dummy" tx) of an output until such time as it is confirmed.
what i initially understood - and it seems a practical means of *tx obfuscation* - is to create a dummy tx (locktimed) that serves as the output of a subsequent "real tx". The value of this intended tx becomes the dummy referenced as output of the next "intended tx", and so on, as a tx chain. But the value of each would have to be exactly the value of that initial "dummy tx".
Well, that's just madness! So I had to ask what you meant :)
MW will make such convolution unnecessary. Does SegWit not enforce the immutability you propose with your scheme?

if we work with the current max blocksize of 1MB and assume a new block every 10mins (average) then that means in one day 144 new blocks are created and they consume 144MB of storage. A month's worth of blocks would require a -prune setting of 31*144 = 4464

I think you might be misunderstanding how layer 2 protocols are implemented. The payment channels are not opened, per payee, on Bitcoin layer 1, but on the layer 2 protocol instead. Layer 2 only settles to layer 1 periodically - not per payee - but per layer 2 node/hub. That's the scaling solution.

that's what luke-jr is saying: assumption is a risk, hence the "trustless" characteristic of Bitcoin. The more people who are not trusting (relying on) others to do validation for them, the better for Bitcoin.
Think of it like this: invalid transactions don't only affect the parties involved, but it degrades the perceived (and statistical) validity of the whole Bitcoin network. Hence, the more people who are validating, for themselves (the txns that they are party to) all the better for Bitcoin, specifically, and the whole ecosystem, generally.

Bitfinex is an unregulated and centralized BTC/USD exchange. Hence their primary partner is the bank, which ensures the USD part of their liabilities. 
I assume they have no pressure or incentive to insure BTC, since there is neither such regulation in Hong Kong, nor a bank-partnered insurer out there who insures this, as yet, poorly understood (by the finance sector) cryptocurrency. 
However, Bitfinex could easily have mitigated against the hack by offering trader-side multisig wallets. The facility is possible and is used by some exchanges.
Any which way, I advised my clients to leave Bitfinex after their "insider trading" debacle. Shame on them.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:43:28
Hi dooglus, the matter of "insider trading" is not generally well understood and seems counter-intuitive at first. It is interesting to see in your post how you progress through the stages of realization as to why corporate officers and employees with privileged knowledge have an unfair advantage if they trade their own company stocks, or financial instruments.
The dry SEC definition is outlined here: 
As you discovered, the privileged information gives the inside trader an unfair advantage (versus the rest of the participants) in a highly competitive market. Another example might be that the insider "tips off" a third party, either as a favor, for a commission, or as payment for privileged information in-kind.
"Front running" the market is another expressly forbidden type of insider trade. You give a good example and typically, the front runner will act on his knowledge of a large order that is not visible in the orderbook - whether it be a hidden order (only visible to exchange officers) or an agreed *at-market order* to be executed at a certain time. An *at-market order* does not go into the orderbook, it is executed immediately and consumes X amount of orders in the orderbook, thereby causing a large price movement. 
The front runner uses this knowledge to bet in the same direction as the large order prior to it being executed. The Nasdaq describes it like this:
With bitcoin being unregulated, this kind of thing must be rampant across all exchanges. We cannot know the extent of these practices, but I don't believe us being fatalistic about it is a mindful attitude either. When the opportunity presents itself we have to shine light in the dark corners and clean out what we find there, as an example and as a deterrent. 
It is not enough for exchange officers, who have access to privileged market information in their orderbook, to innocently say that they don't trade their own instrument, or that they don't act on the privileged information. Nor is it acceptable that the exchange reassures us that "the team monitors their account" (as is being posited by Bitfinex). 
**Exchange clients must demand verifiable policies and procedures that prevent insider trading by company officers**. Enforced internally and verified from outside the exchange. The exchanges will wiggle and squirm with impunity, but the fact of the matter is that they offer an ecosystem service in a technology that not only makes scrutiny possible, but a duty. In the necessary absence of Bitcoin oversight and enforcement bodies, customers must demand certain transparencies and operational conduct, as much as the centralized regulators demand the same on the fiat side of the books.
Bitfinex CSO Phil Potter interview:
We have an apparent case here, of a Bitfinex officer admitting to trading his own company's instrument, then backpedaling the statement and then denying it outright. Yet, other officers are on record as saying that he was only doing it a little bit, and imploring leniency of the type: you can't blame him, wouldn't you do it too?
The crime is severe and in the present moment requires investigation. That's what many would like to see, but there are Bitfinex employees and officers in these pages who are attempting to squash discussion and throw red herrings.
I don't know *what* was going on at Bitfinex, but something about their version of events is irregular - a yarn... Hopefully a loose end becomes apparent and the whole thing can be unraveled. The concern is that there is a lot of time-wasting being done by Bitfinex. Their premises and systems should be quarantined while investigators and auditors get to work. Instead, BitGo and Bitfinex are saying that they will, between them, get to the bottom of it. Now that's the milk of corporate kindness for you. How casually audacious and they take Bitcoin users for fools! Bitfinex must be laid bare and investigated.

In my understanding that's not how it works - in either case:
* layer 1 (Bitcoin protocol) doesn't know about layer 2 channels
* layer 2 settles according to its own schedule, regardless of when someone transacts or cashes in/out.
My understanding is that LN (and other layer2 protocols) represents an intermediate bitcoin transaction layer on top of Bitcoin's layer1. The payment "channels" are objects that exist in layer2. So "opening a channel" is something you do in layer2.
Layer2 nodes aggregate the millions of micro txns that happen in their native payment channels and then settle these as single transactions to layer1 once a week (or month, or as appropriate).
So, 100,000 different transactions (worth, say, 77 BTC) between 50,000 different people across 8,000 payment channels during the course of a week might be settled, at the end of the week, by the 5 nodes that provide and manage those payment channels as five blockchain (layer1) transactions of 50, 20, 5, 1 and 1 BTC.
The channels reside in layer2, they are opened and closed there. Layer2 does the accounting, caching and settling according to its own schedule. Surely?

A growing number would like to see an investigation to uncover the proof, or to disprove it. Either way, you are correct, there is a rising tide of malcontent against Bitfinex, so old ghosts come back to haunt them and the allegations take wing hungry for the truth.

A potential path of action for disgruntled Bitfinex customers is to take advantage of the ongoing technical downtrend in bitcoin price ( as identified and qualified [here]( ) - by shorting bitcoin in Bitfinex, to take profit at $500; and then convert all holdings to BTC and move to the next better exchange.
That will be a tactical thorn in the side of Bitfinex, as well as a strategic blow, since rumors imply the entire "hack" saga was merely a smokescreen for Bitfinex running out of liquidity at $605 on the previous Groundhog Day, Aug 2.

without writing a tome: there are technical indications in the chart that make certain scenarios likely and eliminate others (as possibilities). 
Market mood determines direction (positive mood causes the majority of participants to buy; negative mood causes selling behavior).
Hence, given the scenarios implied by technical analysis, combined with a sense of the dominant market mood, we can predict the most probable outcome at critical junctures. Sometimes incorrectly, sometimes generally and sometimes accurately. Mostly, it's a bit like the hyperdrive on the Milennium Falcon, yet for some smugglers that's good enough to profit by!

I'm not sure if there is any harm in running a node part-time, and other comments imply not. I would argue, however, that running it full-time is more efficient for the network, since your uptime on the network establishes a reliable node path and consumes less resources than having to sync the large amounts of data that grew while your node was offline.
If you're going to physically switch off the hardware, then consider leaving it running 24/7  (but sometimes offline) since power initialization stresses hardware and shortens component lifespan: CPU, drives, memory, etc.

sounds like a good means of tx obfuscation, while still satisfying protocol rules.

Indeed, Potter admitted to having access to the full orderbook and using the information to trade in his Bitfinex account... that's just a joke. And neither him nor the Bitfinex board could see any problem with that. I got out (edit: closed my trading account) the same day.
Veneering multisig and other BitGo flimflam over such a stinky turd is no solution or security. I sense that much more will come to light about what happened at Bitfinex all these years.
What shows their "British in Hong Kong" arrogance is the fact that they put a 23-year old Zane Tackett on the frontline to face an angry world on behalf of the old boys spending the summer in blighty. Can't do that in court and won't do that now that the chips are down.

It's a strange phenomenon that every community will also have its contingent that seeks to defile the topic around which everyone has gathered.
In another topic field, I am a member of a (market) technical analysis site that features economic news and user forums for discussing markets, economy and analysis. The centerpiece and topic is markets and their analysis, right? The obvious benefits are learning, collaboration and, therefore, improved trading (by each user) in the market. Its been useful according to this consensus understanding for almost 10 years.
Yet, during the course of the past 3 years, a vocal and malignant contingent has developed (and is growing) that engages in argument and trolling: their premis is that analysis of markets is pointless; that nothing useful can be gleaned from technical, fundamental or sentiment analysis; and that anyone who posts analysis or trade discussion is lying. The common allegation against those who post trade ideas or results is that they are "agents" of the banks or forex brokers spreading disinformation to get unwitting traders to "give" their money to the industry crooks.
There's a lot to deduce from this kind of negative victim mentality. Profound ignorance drives it and the vitriol and anger that manifests speaks of disillusion and complete disconnect from experiential reality. Obviously, it has become unpleasant and unproductive to engage in that forum. It seems to be related to a generation coming up, and either to their own or to a wider societal shift toward an emotional state of fear, anger and dystopia, as opposed to a rational mature appraisal of facts, opinions, phenomena and their implications.
It's good that r/btc is available for this same contingent to wallow in their condition over there, rather than here.

I believe someone posted that they (the OP) had notified the authorities in Hong Kong, but I'm not sure Bitfinex is based in HK anymore...
Earlier today, I noticed some people slobbering all over Tackett's hands after he delivered the blanket bail-in announcement. It was sad to witness because it reminded me of the all-too-human aspect of this fiasco: most traders and speculators have ALL their funds in one place. Some of them have been nurturing those funds and doing their best to grow the funds in a tough market (I've traded most asset classes - and believe me - bitcoin is one of the most difficult charts out there). These guys are spilling blood, sweat and tears on the cryptocoaster.
Then, field-left, during one of the surest short opportunities of the year, Bitfinex customers discover that these bank partners can do what they want. Same old story all over again. They can freeze, or take your money off you like a mugger. Even your Satoshi Nakamoto bitcoins.
The relief to get anything back - just something - and soon - is like the pigs letting you walk free. Ain't no way you're going to agitate them in that moment. You know what I mean?
To the rest of us there are principles at stake, a sense of indignance and fish to fry, but if I put myself in the boots of a guy that's been finexed, i realize he's too traumatized (or shocked) to pick up a rock right now.
Finex (and partners) have played this with a slow hand probably because they fear a sell-off at open. I'm astounded to be honest.

ask on the  IRC if you need to download the entire blockchain before you can export bitcoin-core wallet's private keys.
If you can export the keys then you can import them to another wallet such as Electrum.
Alternatively, use [pywallet]( to access the *wallet.dat* file directly. *You'll need to install Python 2.7 to run either Electrum or pywallet*
Of course running your own Bitcoin Core fullnode is preferable, but my reasoning here is that you want to check or access the funds sooner rather than later - before the client has fetched the whole blockchain, right?

(sigh)... the article preamble contains so many factual inaccuracies about Bitcoin, and the entrepreneur being interviewed seems to be blinded by the theoretical possibilities of "blockchain minus Bitcoin" without having actually stopped to ask himself: **who** is going to mine and decentralize all these proposed blockchains, and for what incentive?
e.g. Companies A, B and C need to settle $1mil on a daily basis. They implement a private blockchain with 3 nodes - one each. Each day they settle fixed rate value tokens via blockchain, 3 ways. Humbug. What exactly is the value proposition here? A single host running SQLite can do that. If there are trust issues, they can trust it to a 3rd party or run one node each that compares settlement ledgers 3 ways. But blockchain? Is DLT  starting to resemble snake oil?
Yes, the theoretical use-cases are many, but without a need for decentralized consensus, why implement a blockchain at all?

I don't want to devalue your hard work researching this, but must point out that you can see that declining wave structure a thousand times over in the bitcoin price chart - at different timeframes and in all exchanges since the beginning of price history.

Its good and right that you're comfortable with your manhood and your intellectual toolkits at age 23. However, that "advice" was not directed at you but was a question for your management. Well, depending on which Zane is responding, of course.
About right and wrong, no... it's not about that. It's about the allegation that is resurfacing and spreading through the dissatisfied mob and general public beyond. Remember, this is not my reddit post, I'm just commenting here. And then you and a lot of stiff-necked guys show up and say the allegations are wrong. Well, you see there's the junior toolkit introducing fuzzy thinking:
* The fact of actual insider trading *may* be proven wrong. 
* That Bitfinex CSO Phil Potter operated with running conflicts of interests *may* be shown to be true or untrue in future
I'm not trying to prove either points. This is not a courtroom or convenient forum for submission and evaluation of proof for the above allegations. 
I'm simply commenting on the OPs spotlight on these allegations. Whether true or false I don't know, but Potter is the one in the recording right? That's CSO Potter, as you yourself, Zane, acknowldge. Potter makes some statements in those recordings that are a cause for concern. To anyone in the Bitcoin space, and especially those who had the misfortune of being Bitfinex customers, right? So, now they're irked. And Potter's own statements imply certain sloppy attitudes and lax practices. Whether the implications have validity remains to be seen. I'm not saying the alleged misconduct or crimes actually happened, but now it seems worthy of further investigation. To many more than it did only 7 days ago, right?
I have a Friday night ahead and...  bid thee farewell Zanes - I'll be back - but probably not interested in the woes of Bitfinex tonight. Maybe, later.

@_date: 2016-08-05 15:57:45


I've added nothing, as you say, and did not propose to add anything. I am interested in the resurfacing of these allegations because they are relevant to the current crisis.


Let me first point out that you're mixing up the series of events and imagining motives. 
* I am commenting on a reddit post (this one) that was created by a different user.
* The allegation has become a topic of conversation in various social forums, of late, of direct concern to me when it came up in discussion in a trading consortium I belong to.  Fellow traders who are Bitfinex clients are gravely concerned and indignant  - I am relaying their concerns
* The allegations have been reanimated by events at Bitfinex and not by me. Surely?


I state the popular allegation in a post comment. Zane Tackett - a youth, granted - accuses me of lying. Then his inexperience leads him to respond to a popular expression "The British in Hong Kong" as if I said there were Brits and Hong Kongers to blame. 
So how must I respond to a young office pup? This is Reddit and not corporate email, right? So I correctly warned him that he lacks experience and intellectual kung fu to deal with a seasoned mind or a baying pack. I told him to go fetch you, because it is unfair that an office boy should be the public interface to a major corporate crisis like this. So you have the public outrage and incumbent allegations on one hand, but you have youngster who necessarily lacks experience to deal with it. Be nice to the kid even when he lays down the corporate line in a public forum. Clever, but I took him behind the neck, reminded him of public reality and told him to fetch you. You understand what I did there?


I have no shame, since this is about the security of my money. Money can make people do terrible things. But I did nothing to be hung about. When someone breaks trust or loses money, I talk strong and demand answers from smug individuals and companies like the one you work for. There is no shame or notion of shame when it comes to the security of money: there is only success or failure, good practice or bad. Some Bitfinex whipper snapper rep should not pretend to have authority in these matters in an open discussion forum where he risks being bitten by a big dog or two.


kitty claws. You don't know what my motive is or where this is heading. I will make the allegation from the roof tops. Many others will do the same. Bitfinex CSO Potter admits in an interview that he engages in "range trading" via market "bids and sells" while having full insight into the Bitfinex orderbooks, as an executive. Zane Tackett confirmed this in a comment elesewhere.


I'm not making the allegation, it predates this post (which is not mine) and it is published widely. During the past several days the allegation is being discussed in many forums. Funny enough, I have in the past, based on a hunch, made allegations that then turned out to be true. So, as a trader who is comfortable with odds of 51%/49% I don't care to be wrong sometimes.


If only you could see, at the outset, that a supposedly baseless allegation does not warrant repeated desperate denial by a team of posters, then you would not have become familiar with me and my quality words. If only you can expose Potter and the strange hidden events that the public sense at Bitfinex, so the clients can have their hard earned money returned to them.

Every block is stored on every node, so the size of blocks is a consideration for affordability, with each new block that is created. 
However, there are other vectors too, such as bandwidth since every block and all transactions must be propagated through the peer-to-peer network.

I disagree politely. I sense your dedication to research, which is worthy because scientific enquiry should pursue truth. Consider the [Safire Lab]( which seeks to prove, by evidence-based experiment, an electric sun hypothesis - they are adequately funded, by private funders (including Bitcoinistas) to do their work using both conventional electronic components and modest computing power.
The problem is that the distinction between science and modern theoretical maths has become blurred. These theoretic mathematicians need computing power to "model". The proof is not in the CGI model but in the observable behavior of the actual physics. They should get real jobs - they have been mis-educated - and are looking for fish up a tree :)

In a static world we might expect LN to reduce on-chain txns but this is not that world. 
On the deeper end of the pool: Science (with a capital "S"nake) is not an independent field of righteous enquiry, but a field heavily financed by and media-supported by Zio-funding institutions. Hence, all the abstract "Quantum" nonsense that has filled scientific and popular discourse for the past century. Most people are not even aware that the quest for blackholes and dark-matter has been abandoned during the past few weeks, due to complete failure at CERN and various quantum labs.
Genome-mapping and trips to Mars are, rationally, irrelevant until we, as ordinary citizens, can be satisfied with eliminating fraud by the wealthy (and their captains) as well as political lobbying by these wealthy for the outcomes they wish to see.

If you simply state your opinion and perhaps back it up with your own count, then other readers and myself can consider it and even agree.
What you're presenting, instead of your own EW analysis, is simply negative criticism and calling my work "sloppy" which forces a response.
So, 1 - those lines aren't "counted" - those are Fibonacci extensions of the first clear wave evident in M15 at the base of the structure - and you can see price respects them all the way to the top (and back down again).
point 2. I challenge anyone to try count any Bitcoin price advance as an impulse. It won't add up, because, like the USD index, EURUSD and Gold/Silver, the advances print subwaves of 3-3-3-3-3. Try for yourself - evidently you haven't bothered identifying elementary structures in BTCUSD below M5, else you wouldn't be posturing Smart Alec here and shooting your mouth off. 
There are schools of thought in EW and the orthodox EWI method has been consistently shown to be inadequate by EWI themselves getting almost every market call wrong since the 1990's. So if those Elliotticians who observe the existence of a vanilla diagonal (3-3-3-3-3) that substitues an impulse (5-5-5-5-5), if you believe they're practicing witchcraft, then by all means, follow the orthodox way. It does work for AAPL but it's rules are broken by dual character currency/commodity instruments like the USD, Bitcoin and Gold.
point 3. So "EW is meant to encapsulate market emotion", but you say that BTCUSD is "too fragmented and too controlled". If this was even provably the case, then (as EWP makes the point) those large players are just as human as the rest of the market, because there is no place in the chart where EW rules and guidelines are broken or invalidated - except when trying to count price advances as impulsive.

Very on-point post. Very timely too - the Linux connection, I mean. As for the Red Hat of Bitcoin, it's right there in the Bitcoin Foundation: centralized, closed door, press center version (distribution) of Bitcoin. Well, of course it won't stay that way - nothing lasts forever - and it would be naive to think that the current incarnation of Bitcoin is the One-and-Only, final version. Battlelines are being drawn for control of the network and with time the political will to actualize control will capitulate. 
Whilst the concept of cryptocurrency is creeping into public consciousness, knowledge of Open Source Software and its ideology is still far from general knowledge.
Widespread adoption of Bitcoin means widespread adoption of FLOSS. With it comes a change in the way software is conceived and developed, as well as fundamental changes in the way things are "owned" and "regulated" - and by whom - in a word: change in hegemony.
Bitcoin could be the path-cleaver for the Open Source way of doing things, at the same time as Open Source thinking made Bitcoin possible.

I think the term 'digital currency' (moneda digital) is being used in the Ecuador National Assembly reform bill because this is the term used by the mainstream media and it is also less intimidating/confusing to an uninformed public than the term 'cryptocurrency'. The PanAm Post article was reporting the passing of the government monetary reform bill which includes the proposal of a national digital currency to replace the US Dollar in domestic government spending.
While there is no official statement about the design of the proposed currency, Ecuador would be pretty dim to release a digital currency that is _not_ blockchain based, and not based on Satoshi's design. Their national currency would be wide open to counterfeit and double spending otherwise.
The article outlines their design options. So how is it "not correct"? It's merely relaying what the socialist government of Ecuador passed into law and what the implications absent Bitcoin are.

Your points are good and might have a bearing on what the chart could do. If current price was in an ascending pattern component, then the article would have spoken about price going up and additional risk of advance. However, price is in a descending pattern component during a larger decline, so what do you want the author to say?  Your simplification of my analysis to "it's been going down, so it'll continue down" isn't fair or accurate.You go on to use the same words you put in my mouth as a pivot for a jibe to make yourself look clever. So this warrants a response from me.
My analysis in the article is clear about it's objective: To determine the function of current price action (continue down), list targets to the downside, and define bellwethers of reversal.
Upward breach of the trendline(s) that have capped the decline is the only definitive signal that longer-term reversal is in progress. According to this measure we do not have confirmation of a change in trend or the start of a rally, as many analysts have been proclaiming. The prevalence of premature bottom-calling is why I made the point that decline is technically (and for all practical trading purposes) ongoing.
MtGox, China, weighty SR wallets... yes. There is some argument in favor of fundamental factors and news. However, from a market psychology point of view, the Bitcoin market is characterized by a singular compulsive trait: a morbid fear of missing out on any new rally. This nervous energy means that a rally can be sparked at any moment - even by supposedly "bad" news. And then the headlines are adapted accordingly: "Bitcoin soaring to new heights in defiance of PBoC"
In this understanding, the fundamentals and news do not cause price to move - instead, price movement (collective behaviour) produces the fundamentals and news!

The algorithm used by the Fed is based on their internally developed [Taylor Rule]( which uses various formulae and economic assumptions to project what interest rates "should be" according to the US economy's assumed stage in the **Business Cycle**.
The myriad of complex metrics, economic theory - and outright assumption - that goes into this conjuration renders most citizens' brains foggy and their eyes blurry. So, for general consumption the Fed provides a graphic simply called the "[dot plot](
Essentially, as your tongue-in-cheek question implies, we have the high priests of a sacred institution using theoretical science to impose their doctrine, Centrally Controlled Business Cycle, with the erroneous belief that they (by virtue of their class's power) can control economy via interest rate manipulation and monetary policy. 
Economist Jim Rickards equates it to the Fed thinking that they're controlling the temperature of a house by dialing the heating up and down - except that economy is *not* a closed system - it is chaotic. And besides, the Fed's dial has historically failed them at every critical moment.

My next paragraph addresses the possibility that he is not concerned with price.


Even so, I believe his underlying concern - although he words it in terms of "a horrible solution" - is actually about the hoped-for consequence of "effective" scaling, which must be adoption and hence, I speculate, about the false logic chain:
effective scaling =&gt; increased adoption =&gt; higher price
You're correct that price is not mentioned explicitly, but Falkvinge leaves us to guess what the technical specification of his non-"overly complex scaling" actually is. SegWit is not primarily intended to be a scaling solution. There is no clear and effective solution to Bitcoin's difficulty to scale without compromising decentralization . SegWit happens to be an elegant solution that solves several long-standing security dilemmas, increases network efficiency and creates sustainable block-space over the long-term.
If anyone does not consider SegWit to be efficient in what it achieves then they should level specific technical arguments. In fact, the accepted and available procedure is to create a Pull Request against the code base in GitHub and code the desired less-complex solution. Broad, non-specific brush strokes about "overly complex solution for scaling", leads me to think the plaintif is politiking consensus because he has another vision about what blocksize or a scaling solution should be, but no technical idea or know-how to achieve it? Without any explicit mention of the specific solution, one can only imagine the writer is alluding to scaling needs in relation to the Big Block camp's adoption drive. And the adoption chestnut is sometimes linked to beliefs about price gains and sometimes not. Falkvinge does not specify, so I addressed both.

It seems self-evident doesn't it? Limited supply, increasing demand =&gt; increased value per unit.
The spanner in the works is human psychology - and the fact that the commodity can be bought and sold in the open market.
Sometimes there are more sellers than buyers and the price is decreased, effectively recalibrating the valuation. New buyers effectively buy in at discount.
The speculative dynamic keeps the price chart oscillating because there is the tendency of the majority to buy near the top of a price wave where the early-bird profit takers then transfer wealth from the majority to a minority. At market bottoms, the majority tends to sell, beaten, near the bottom where a smart speculative minority grab the coins at discount.
Hence, its not just a matter of supply and demand, but of shifting supply and demand, and of profit and loss. The majority of speculators make bad decisions in the market. Additionally, social shifts in mood bias market activity from periods of buying to periods of selling (that can last years) and this is what prevents a steady increase in price - as we'd expect from a rational buy-and-hold market. 
As it turns out, the collection of price charts show us that markets are irrational. Why? The explanation seems to be that the collective of speculators are irrational. Bitcoin price appears to be subject to the same principle.

A sincere question: What is the risk of doing nothing?
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:12:03
Acknowledged. I believe there are people like yourself who would like to see more adoption for the sake of utility and the benefit of society. I would like to see this too. However, the belief that increased adoption will cause price increases is prevalent amongst many big block proponents, so I am not wrong to discuss that misconception. But let's focus on your and my concern for beneficial adoption:
If one analyzes the block size issue from all angles and think through the different models, then eventually it becomes clear that Bitcoin does not scale well. This is inherent in the design which is geared toward censorship resistance and consensus. The blockchain is slow (every transaction must be passed around the network, verified and confirmed), expensive (proof of work, bandwidth, storage) and inherently cumbersome (because it is p2p and designed for security not speed).
Increasing blocksize as a means of allowing more transactions per block, does so at the cost of the degree of decentralization of the network, and cannot practically achieve the speed or tx volume of, say, VISA.
Layer 2 protocols such as the Lightning Network (and others) are optimized for small transaction BTC amounts and its almost instant - allowing more transaction volume per second than VISA, etc.
This is the best scaling solution we currently have, and it will keep fees low for BTC microtransactions (via LN). In fact, the other route, of increasing blocksize in order to keep fees low, is counter productive to the Bitcoin network since at each blockreward halving fees must effectively double to keep mining operations profitable.
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:20:13
Agree with your level-headed view.
Western society's disillusionment with debt economy (and therefore central banking) is justified, but the notion that a global credit deflation will see pervasive societal breakdown and the crashing of all fiat can only be described as hystrionic. Yet its the flavor of these times of trending negative social mood.
Fiat will not - cannot - "crash", it can only fall into disuse as more useful money becomes available. In fact, during this unfolding global economic crisis most people will be surprised to see their fiat physical cash notes increase in buying power - notably the US dollar.
    Money supply = cash in circulation + credit
So, if US dollar denominated debt evaporates (defaults, credit "restructuring") then the remaining cash notes will increase in value. Think it through carefully. This is not what the mainstream and even libertarian doomsayers are predicting, because the world has not faced this scenario in living memory. But it happened twice before, as per the explanation and dynamic outlined above.
Love Bitcoin and its promise, but it is far from being a practical everyday (wages, local produce market, rural transport, low- or non-electricity) use case for 80% of the world population for decades to come. We all agree: debt economy is bad, but credit and currency are only married by central banking. There's the problem. Objectively, consensus fiat is entrenched - and for the most part works - in many countries and regions.
For Bitcoin to work and to be valuable, it does not require that all other value tokens or forms of payment must vanish. Such an expectation is fundamentalist and extreme.

Your assumption is incorrect. Core has addressed the issue and the consensus is to nominally increase blocksize to accommodate SegWit and LN.
Now that understanding of the impracticality and implications of large blocks has filtered from the computer scientists to the wider ecosystem, it's no longer a viable option or debate.
The opportunity to implement big blocks had come and gone with Classic and other forks that have ended up in what Nelson Mandela calls "the dustbin of history".

Good summary. The notebook/papersize analogy illustrates the scalability (blocksize) issue well.
It must be pointed out that the OPs statement that


based on how Bitcoin was advertised to him - quick, cheap transactions - was only possible in the early period of the network - but even then never *instant* due to the cumbersome process of network consensus, validation and 6 confirmations. 
"Near-instant" SPV wallets still require trust and represent a security risk, so this is not a viable long-term solution. However, LN also requires trust, but the trade-off gains much: almost unlimited volumes of instant payments and a reduction in Bitcoin network load/volume (less block space consumption).
Extrapolating the scenario whereby the majority of world citizens use Bitcoin for micro transactions with low fees, just doesn't add up: the blockchain and network will be clogged with billions of small transactions consuming terabytes of chain storage. It will be expensive to both run a fullnode and to mine. Mining will be vulnerable to periods of unprofitability whenever consumer spending slumps, or during cyclical recessions when there will be fewer transactions at the already low fee floor.
LN solves that, but only if we acknowledge that, like the bitcoin supply, blockspace must also be scarce - and expensive - for the sake of high degrees of security and decentralization.

from a certain perspective: just as much as poker, roulette, or starting a business, market speculation is gambling - risking money with the intention of gaining more.
position averaging a bet that the EUR/USD will increase in value, for example, is not as smart a gamble as position averaging a BTC bet, because Bitcoin and bitcoin are undervalued and BTC price is guaranteed to hit several more spectacular rallies in the coming years.

Blocks will become full no matter how big they are. This is a principle of economics.
Various Core devs have repeatedly stated that they are not opposed to increasing blocksize. The issue for them, quite rightly, is one of due scientific process: increase blocksize by *how much*, for *what reason*, and with what *testing/observational data*. 
Hence, Core devs have reached consensus to increase blocksize for the implementation of SegWit.
Classic has been available as an means of voting for indefinite block size increases, but not enough people ran nodes. So, ecosystem consensus relegated Classic and the notion of big blocks to the dustbin of history, because simply increasing blocksize because of vocal demands for vague reasons (quote Andressen: "Because bad things will happen") or logical fallacies (increasing blocksize will increase adoption and that will increase price) doesn't make sense in computer science or when it risks $billions of OPM (other people's money). What's more, simply increasing blocksize indefinitely in order to keep fees low, will render mining unprofitable - then we lose the security and decentralization of the network and Bitcoin becomes meaningless.
Core are committed to effectively dealing with Bitcoin's central dilemma, namely that **Bitcoin does not scale well**. 
Its easy to shoot the breeze and have opinions about various technologies and innovations, but the truth is that Bitcoin presents us with more challenges than rocket science.

A fee market is an inevitable reality as the block reward keeps halving and miners depend more and more on fees to keep their operations viable. We want a healthy mining sector for its critical role of decentralizing and securing the blockchain.
Compromising security and degree of decentralization in favor of a big-blocked network that facilitates micro-transactions (coffee) with low fees could hardly have been Satoshi's revolutionary intention. 
At 1MB or 2MB the centralizing pressure is arguably low, but many big-block proponents are proposing that block-size doubles exponentially over years or decades. The logical outcome, as jrattcliff points out - and sipa has been arguing for years - is that **blockspace supply will be consumed** as it becomes available.
If we don't preempt Bitcoin as a settlement base layer, then big business will use it as their settlement network and *lobby* and *reward*, off-chain, their favorite amenable miners. This is one of the risks of big blocks, nevermind the lack of scientific and economic studies of increasing block size.
As I often point out, many arguments in favor of big blocks have, as an unspoken assumption, the notion that increasing block size will increase adoption and therefore drive up price. This is a logical fallacy. There is no evidence from any market that adoption drives price. Buying and selling drives price, irrespective of how many buyers and sellers there are in a market. Just look at the bitcoin price chart during the past 3 years for clarification.

Thanks for taking the time to make your case. This is a heated topic - now somewhat cooled down - but still, there is polarization of opinions and ideology between the big blockers and the blockspace-should-be-scarce camp. We cannot even say that "time will tell" since the big blockers both squandered their opportunity and proved their minority consensus support when they failed to capitulate Classic earlier this year.
My perception of Andresen is that he most certainly regards himself as an authority of sorts in the Bitcoin space - perhaps based on personal interaction with (and selection by) Satoshi - perhaps based on his time in this space - and hence a sense of being a veteran or "senior"... and so on. Who knows what exactly his reasons are, but ultimately we all have difficulty with trading places from head honcho to disenfranchised.
The perception that he (and Hearn, too) had been *outcasted* would've upset those who regard him as a leader or semi-deity, and his new status as a dog - having been a Big Man and now spoken to as a Rubbish Man - would evoke sympathy even in those who were perhaps impartial or uninterested before but resonated with Andresen's arguments in favor of big blocks as a simple answer to many of the ecosystem's challenges.
From my perspective - and the perspective of other developers, scientists, economists, and enthusiasts, Andresen had committed serious errors of conduct that set him on an inevitable path to eventual ejection from the Core team that he once led. 
I cannot recount, here, the many incidents and slanderous correspondences from Andresen over the years. Nor is this the forum to make allegations or lay out evidence. Suffice to say that Satoshi Nakamoto accosted Andresen via a public email in 2015, **precisely for being an enemy of Bitcoin** by breaking its fundamental *consensus rule*.

A corrective wave is developing and its destination is apparently near the recent top. It should continue advancing around 12h00 UTC.
If this is a corrective advance it is bound to make an internal correction from around $700 - and revisit $650 (Bitstamp) - before pushing toward $750.
Just my tea-leaf reading based on previous post-rally corrective structures, to compare to your own speculative planning.

Perhaps, this paragraph stated later explains the dynamic. 


Yes, price can rise as new adopters initially "buy into" the asset, yet their buying may very well lift price into attractive profit taking areas for speculators who had bought previously, turning them into sellers, in turn, and correcting price. 
Over the long-term (years and decades) we would expect a gradual average price increase, but it is also dependent on external economic conditions too. There are (rare) events where a majority of market participants can become sellers - not because they are bearish on bitcoin or gold - but because they desperately need to cash out.

Interesting to read the observation (now removed) from a bank worker. I've gotten the impression (and I'm not including the poster in this characterization) that many in the conventional financial world are experiencing a cocaine-like power surge due to the potential they imagine Bitcoin to offer their world.
The reason is, of course, because there is money involved. New money and new technology that the early-bird vulture can capitalize upon. However, bitcoin is anaethema to the fiat currency and the very debt economy that they imagine it is going to re-invigorate and reinvent.
In the end, and too late, the banks and finance sector opportunists will discover that they had ingested a fatal dose of ideological laxative.
Bitcoin's blockchain only has meaning because it is decentralized and steered by consensus. Another blockchain, such as the one imagined by the BoE or Fed, will have no decentralization if it does not incentivize diverse mining, hence there will be no consensus benefit and, so, why use blockchain at all? On the other hand, if the corporation or central authority does reward the multitudes to mine and run their network nodes, then the mass of consensus will result in the 3rd party becoming irrelevant.
In this sense Bitcoin represents a rat trap. And good so.

The topic is interesting and we can debate it out. 
Let's examine a few oversimplified scenarios to get closer to an understanding of what drives price.
1. **Buy-and-Hold only:**
Let's assume that every single adopter (participant) has the same strategy: buy 1 bitcoin and hold it indefinitely - no-one sells their bitcoin, ever. The market outcome would be that approx 15mil people would hold all the bitcoin in circulation and that 1800 new adopters could buy 1 BTC each every day for the 4 years after the July halving when 1800 BTC will be released per day. After a century, 21mil people would each hold 1 BTC and the price would have climbed to, say, $100k per BTC and Bitcoin would have a market cap of approx $2tril.
2. **Remittance only:**
In this scenario no-one holds a bitcoin for longer than 10mins. The world uses the Bitcoin protocol only for doing remittance: buy from one exchange, send the BTC to someone else, who then converts back to fiat via another exchange. Each bitcoin bought is sold as soon as possible, within 30mins, so the net effect is that the buys and associated sells cancel each other out and price remains stagnant. If we assume a minimum *pip value* of $0.01 and price is at $300, then buying one BTC will tick price to $300.01 and the remittance sell 30mins later will tick price back down to $300.00. Whether one person does this or 7bil people do, price will return to an average of $300 with a range of several dollars either way, since the equal amount of buys and sells will cancel one another out. Remember, in this scenario no-one holds on to their bitcoin - it is always sold again on the same day.
There are other scenarios such as leveraged speculation and short selling, etc but let's keep with the above two. The bitcoin market place is obviously a shifting mixture of buy-and-hold, remittance, payments, leveraged speculation and so on. Let's simplify our exploration by assuming that the coinbase is stable (no new coins are being added by miners, since this introduces supply inflation which (slightly) devalues existing bitcoin in circulation and is irrelevant for this example). Also, let's ignore lost coins and OTC (the latter involves buying and selling that does not tick the exchange price).
The primary fact of markets is that **for every buyer there is a seller**.
Without a seller offering bitcoin in the market, an eager buyer can only wait and hope.
If I want to buy a bitcoin from the exchange then I purchase it from a willing seller at his price. If I decide his price is too high then I can place a limit order to purchase at a lower price. An active seller may choose to sell to me at that price - or not. So there are variations in buying and selling expectations of what a bitcoin is worth - what a reasonable price is - and it changes over time, as we see in the charts. 
Imagine price is currently at $1000 per bitcoin. 100 sellers who are desperate to sell at the current market price may all place their sell orders at $1000.01. Assuming (for our example) that BTC can only be purchased in units of 1 BTC per person, then 100 new adopters will each buy 1 BTC at $1000.01 and price will not change (advance) at all, despite 100 consecutive buy trades.
This scales to 1000s and 100s of 1000s in the market, and we see that new adopters do not necessarily increase the price when they buy. Instead, it depends on the balance of buyers to sellers and on the curious phenomenon whereby people's concept of *"fair value"* changes from year to year, or even minute to minute.

Do 'we'? Or is that an allegation by those who do not want to hear Satoshi's thoughts on the matter?
The email comes from his usual account. The message is measured and consistent with Satoshi's line of reasoning. He only requests that the developers heed Satoshi's rule of consensus. There is, equally, no proof that the email is *not* from Satoshi and the spirit of its contents is true to Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin innovation comes with some caveats:
1. To ensure a healthy, decentralized and secure network there must be plenty of miners. Over time, miners will become more and more dependent on fees to make their operation viable.
2. Bitcoin's network is deemed to be the world's largest supercomputer. Every transaction and block must be passed around between the nodes of the network to be validated and verified. This means the blockchain is inherently slow and expensive (resource intensive).
3. Points 1 and 2 make possible Bitcoin's features of being censorship resistant, of allowing trustless payments and contracts, and of being programmable money secured by mathematical consensus.
We, therefore, have a p2p digital token and public ledger that is more than a mere payment system. For its features to work as intended (as described in Satoshi's whitepaper), it means that Bitcoin does not scale well, on the one hand, and that a fee market will develop according to natural market forces and per design.
Since Bitcoin was not designed only as a payment network, especially not for micro-transactions (coffee), LN and other layer 2 apps will allow VISA like functionality and speed at low fees.

Good point. Anyone who bought on Brexit Friday was unlikely to have done so before the pound hit its straight down multi-decade low. Additionally they would have bought BTC at the top of a corrective advance that has now (Sunday) returned to decline. It would have been a bad trade - a buy near the top - and now they're going to experience gut-wrenching price fluctuation in the open market BTC price chart. Yes, their money is absolutely cryptographically secure in bitcoin, but its fiat exchange rate will be bucking and weaving on the cryptocoaster.
It would be plain contrary to say Brexit had nothing to do with the market fluctuations on Friday, but not in the direct causal way most commentators are saying. Market participants were waiting for a catalyst to sell stocks and buy safehaven assets. Gold and Bitcoin are both coming down, and that begs the question: "Why? Because the Brexit panic is over?" The answer is simpler - same as its been since the beginning of markets: Speculators buy and sell, and use news events, irrespective of their content, as catalysts to do what they were going to do anyway. 
Surely, the largest speculators in this market don't buy and hold on hopamine... instead, like in all other markets, they turn on the wave machine going into perceived "important" events.

Exactly. It's not about trying the experiment with $billions of Other People's Money. It's for those proposing that we sacrifice decentralisation for larger blocks to do the lab time and to present the research findings. Including Roger Ver.
This - research, due scientific process - has always been the position of the Core team, and not stinginess, a blockade or some power trip.
While Ver's work in the Bitcoin space is much needed and appreciated, his inability to acknowledge the vulnerability inherent in the p2p network's degree of decentralisation is a critical shortcoming in his thinking about Bitcoin. His argument that blockspace is a commodity and, therefore, subject to supply and demand is true at face value, but he fails to incorporate the effect of **induced demand** in his model. In large systems, such as transport systems or health care, an increase in supply typically stimulates greater demand. Hence, a policy of  increasing blocksize to unconditionally meet demand risks exponential growth and exponentially weakening decentralisation.
The last point of his "benefits of Bitcoin adoption" paragraph contains some factual errors:


He might mean to say "mining fee income has gone up", but it is a logical fallacy that adoption will drive price higher. In a buy-and-hold only universe this might be true, but the dominant vector acting on the bitcoin price chart is speculation and speculators buy to sell and sell to buy - this is what drives the chart and it will always be true irrespective of how many people have adopted Bitcoin. For every adoption buyer there is a willing seller. With a single large sell order, one seller can sell to a 1000 buyers without the price chart moving up one tick.

Bcash is an altcoin with its own chain, own token and distinct transactions and UTXO set. It is incorrect to think that the tokens on either chain are equivalent or interchangeable. Hence, the amount of bitcoin (21mil) has not doubled - it remains unchanged.

@_date: 2016-06-14 11:42:10
Good point about mass adoption and the thinking man's conclusion that ensuring as high a degree of decentralization as possible is the primary consideration whenever attempting to improve Bitcoin.
Falkvinge implies that SegWit's primary design objective is to scale Bitcoin, which it is not. Nor are malleability fixes. These are only aspects of a package of related impacts proposed by SegWit: 
1. fraud-proofs and multisig security
2. linear scaling of sighash ops
3. reduced UTXO growth
4. blocksize gains
5. efficiency improvement for nodes and the network
6. [and more described by the Core developers](
But let's cut to the quick of what seems to be the underlying assumption driving Falkvinge's criticism: 
Even shallow inquiry reveals that the notion, that *increased adoption must necessarily lead to a proportional increase in price*, is **a fallacy**. The notion seems logical at the initial moment of brain-connect because we sense that its a case of simple supply and demand, yet, surpisingly, markets only tend to bubble during their price discovery phase, and then tend to plateau despite increased adoption and participation. One of the reasons is that **an increase in the number of participants does not only mean an increase in the amount of buyers, but also an increase in the amount of sellers**. Every buyer will, at some point, and for some reason, also sell.
It is evident from posts here and across most media that there is a commonly held misconception that increased adoption will permanently send bitcoin price to $10k and $100k levels. From this perspective, well, of course, then speculators should do everything within their means to encourage increased adoption. Only, the tenet of the belief (that adoption in and of itself ramps price) is neither supported by real world examples nor observed market dynamics. The 2013 bitcoin price rally above $1000, for example, was driven by only a fraction of the number of participants that are evident in the 2015 chart, yet the larger number of participants (adopters) could not get price above $300 for most of 2015. Hence, price rises and falls based on the balance of buyers to sellers and not on how many participants there are in the market. Savvy?
The custodians of Bitcoin, the Core developers, do not have, as a primary objective (or responsibility), the task of increasing adoption and, therefore, price. The Core developers' primary objective is optimization of the **consensus mechanism**, of ensuring **maximum decentralization**, **security**, and *adherence to the whitepaper design*.
If Falkvinge's sole criticism of the excellent SegWit code is that its contribution to scalability does not ramp adoption fast enough, then it is probably because he mistakenly believes - like Andresen and Hearn - that a more aggressive scaling mechanism will ensure more rapid adoption and that the final outcome will be a large and permanent price increase. There are logical fallacies all along that chain of supposed causes and effects. If the hoped-for price increase is to be only temporary, then that is even worse: **roping in new adopters** so aggressive speculation in exchanges will leave them as **bag-holders** at the climax (and logical sell-off conclusion) of the hype.
If Falkvinge's criticism has nothing to do with price but only scaling for the sake of increasing adoption, then, in the end, I agree with [BobAlison]( comment above: slower adoption equals more security and sure-footed development in the long-run.

No disrespect in discussion, and you state your argument very well. I enjoyed reading your reply.
There is an ideological distinction between Linux kernel and Bitcoin in that Linus Torvalds oversees kernel development as a self-declared benevolent dictator. He sets direction in terms of vision and milestones; has the final say about who gets to contribute, and makes judgment calls about the inclusion/exclusion of code, etc. So Linux kernel development although under an Open Source license is centralized in terms of its management - as reflected by its private (non-public) Git repository (git is itself an open source project commissioned by Torvalds).
Yes,  there are different distributions of Linux, yet, they all use the same Linux kernel - Torvalds's kernel. And there is no significant (or useful) alternative code base/fork of the Linux kernel.
The Bitcoin project by contrast has, for various and whatever reasons, adopted the Open Source team development model. Satoshi departed and assigned an OSS-type role to Andresen (Lead Maintainer), whilst insisting on the Consensus Rule - that only uncontroversial changes be made to Bitcoin - on "near unanimous agreement".
Satoshi's "reference client" is represented by the Bitcoin Core code at [ Of course, anyone can fork it and do what they want with the code. Like most code enthusiast I also have a git fork where get up to nonsense and experiment with ZeroMQ, fee prediction, etc.
However, there are no meaningful (or useful) standalone forks out there - whatever improvement anyone makes tends to go back into the collaboration Core code - a "broad church" for developers and computer scientists from all around the world.
The proliferation of forks around the time of XT and "Classic" was a fever for flavor IMO. Additionally, Classic was a coordinated attempt to hijack the blockchain and its market capitalization by a bunch of clowns with Silicon Valley funders. They've crawled back into the woodwork it seems.
Hence, Bitcoin Core is the official reference client - historically and by ongoing consensus. The Classic attempt at a coup failed, so Core and its developers remain. The talent and brains in that team is formidable and they welcome contribution.
Running the team like the Linux kernel team would be too centralized I believe. I think this whole consensus rule thing is very new and we're all getting our heads and attitudes around it - slowly but surely!

I've come round to understanding that SegWit (BIP141) abandons the notion of blocksize (and a 1MB limit) in favor of *block weight*, so with SegWit 4MB blocks are theoretically possible.
The NYA's "segwit2x" intends to increase that theoretical maximum to 8MB, if I understand their proposal correctly. That's considered to be too aggressive for a security-first Bitcoin.
Besides the fact that the btc1 developers, charged with the creation of "segwit2x", lack credibility and merit, the idea that a group of business owners make plans for Bitcoin behind closed doors does not suit an open source development method and Bitcoin's consensus rule.

Consider that if bitcoin price does advance above the previous all-time high near $3000, then most analysts predict $3600. Other analysts are predicting a correction to the downside. We cannot know because no-one can see the future. Seeing that price is less than $300 below the all-time high it may be sensible to wait for price to begin trading above $3000 before buying. In this way you mitigate the risk of an advance that fails to hold above $3000. If you look at the chart of the past several months there have been several attempts to get above $3000 - and all have failed so far. Good luck!

Patent or not, the BIPs proposing the idea of increasing blocksize according to an indefinite doubling schedule had no science informing them and no basis in reality. Its as if those developers and proposers were so exuberant about Bitcoin that they forgot economics. They proverbially lost their minds or over-confidently blabbed their ignorance (in some cases, both)
Of course, blocksize will have to increase in the future, as needed and informed by research, observation and tests. And it may also, evidently, need to be decreased at some critical junctures in the future. Nothing grows indefinitely without the need for sympathetic contraction. We can see this in the cycles of nature and markets since time. Yes, we don't see it in the past 40 years' debt economy, because the same hare-brained notion of indefinite growth informs it too. Yet, it makes sense that Consensus will dictate the growth and shrinking, just like it is doing now, right?

Bitcoin is a robustly secure store of value with a censorship-resistant network that will conceivably contain your bitcoin forevermore. That's its value proposition. However, the price is another story because it is highly volatile due to bitcoin price floating in the open market: no regulation, no controlling authority and no bars on stupendous speculation. As much as bitcoin price can overshoot to the upside, it also tends to overshoot to the downside during long periods (months/years) of price correction.
So, as other comments suggest, it may make sense to not buy all of the bitcoin you intend to hold all at the same moment. Current prices have been floating at all-time highs for a few months. Is that a sensible time to buy? It might be if price continues advancing beyond $3000, but it would be a regret to buy all-in, now, if price declines to $2000 in the coming period. I don't want to give specific advice - so as to not cause offense if I'm wrong - but you should have your own action plans for what to do when price is high and what to do when price is low. Its always a good idea to have cash reserves ready for those instances where price begins pushing higher from low points in the long-term chart.

By conspiracy theories (plural), are you referring to my casting doubts on cancer research? That is one arguable point I make, not a theory but based on research illustrating links between increased nitrogenphostfate fertilizer use, reduced crop nutrient content, and increases in disease, cancer being the top of the list.

The notion that, in addition to solving blockhashes, Bitcoin PoW could also have other outcomes that are beneficial to society is interesting and could be realized in the future.
However, the primary technical requirement is that Bitcoin mining should be difficult - as a security feature. The challenge is how to reconcile SHA256 hashing (at the required protocol difficulty) with the trivial level of difficulty of folding
Another challenge is political: many of these folding "scientific" projects are bogus with questionable research and objectives. E.g. solving genetic sequencing problems for cancer research, can be argued to be cart-before-horse when much research indicates that the cause of cancer lies in the quality of mass-produced, fertilizer-based food brought to us by monopolies like Monsanto, etc.
Also, given that we're into the next solar minimum cycle and entering a period of global cooling, mining production can be expected to become nominally cheaper (less cooling required) in the coming decades.
Still, harnessing hashing cycles for additional beneficial outcomes remains an interesting proposition. Some argue that the actual benefit (and only justification) for wasteful hashing is Bitcoin itself.

Indeed, such as after the 1929 Wall Street crash and now.
After the 2008 "Credit Crunch" the Fed immediately implemented QE (inflation of money supply) as a means of creating more credit (the major component of modern-day money supply) in order to create liquidity and avoid a deflationary spiral. The conjured credit was introduced into the global economy as "bail-outs" to key US companies (mostly banks and credit providers) and their subsidiaries abroad.
Presently, the Fed is leading global central banks down a path of reducing the availability of credit - i.e. making borrowing expensive - by increasing interest rates. Their halting of QE, in 2015, and now decreasing the credit component of money supply, is deflationary.
Effectively, and contrary to popular belief, fiat inflation reversed several years ago. The US dollar has gained value (spending power) since 2013. On reflection you'll notice that most consumer goods have become cheaper during the past 2 years - that's a symptom of deflation.
The linked Wikipedia article starts with the "modern" definition of inflation:


This definition can only be found in dictionaries since 2000. Prior to that the definition was: *an increase in the volume of money and credit relative to available goods and services*. The latter definition specifies the cause (increasing money supply) while the modern-day definition only describes the effect (increases in the price of goods and services).
That the centuries-old definition of inflation changed is a direct consequence of the 1971 Breton Woods implementation of the fiat currency experiment and its arbitrary yardstick of 2% annual price increases of global goods and services. Keeping the spotlight on the effects of money supply inflation - pumping the global credit bubble - distracts from the Fed's role as central authority enacting the cause.
There is no example from history, btw, where a credit bubble did not end in deflation:

Japan is a good example of deflation in action and, especially, how central bank policy shenanigans are powerless against deflation once it sets in. While the mainstream media obsesses over the risk of inflation - and hyper-inflation - there is little or no mention of *deflation*, eventhough its catalysts have been in place for years and measurable deflation is evident in many national economies.
Typically, when we see headlines dominated by wails of deflation, we'll know its already behind us!

Some patterns may be complex and appear random. Some patterns may be simple but obfuscated by noise - so if someone shows you the pattern, suddenly it cannot be unseen/unheard/etc.
However, we cannot say that a pot of disparate ingredients is actually a complex recipe if it does not taste good. So a pattern should be discernible to the viewer/analyst (like a dish to a diner) in order to be useful: identifiable and repeating.
At different scales of perspective, randomness can reveal underlying or overarching pattern. Some argue that nothing is truly random. Efforts to generate randomness are difficult as cryptography shows us.

I know you, Mr MillyBitcoin, you're the guy that passes himself off as a sometimes punk, sometimes spunky Bitcoin babe and then a Caribbean database manageress when you want to feign gravity.
You attempted, in full view of the world, to apply capitalist-style corporate governance to Bitcoin's Open source development model in complete ignorance of what the Open Source model is or the defiance that birthed it. That was a joke and the developers were surprizingly patient with your still-born idea.
Now you want to tell me that an immature fighty-boy like Hearn was reasonable. Besides writing crap Java and an unnecessarily noisy BitcoinJ, Hearn has the most prevalent misinformed view of markets. Yet, he was as confident as a lord that he was an authority on market economics. A hare brained mistake. By being convinced by his English public schoolboy charade, you show that you're confused on so many levels that I can safely continue ignoring your lumpen blabber-mouth, as always. 
Bitcoin was not designed for and is not currently intended for use by the "general population" (whatever demographic you imply with those terms). Litecoin is, and many other clones. Anyone can use Bitcoin, freely, but has either it, or LiteCoin, gained any traction with the general population? Ironically, the sheeple are applauding and rushing to a Bitcoin ETF.

thanks for the summary of the CNN article.
Note that the term "unbanked poor" was first introduced by Prahalad in his publication [the Wealth at the Bottom of the Pyramid]( which was an Indian academic's invitation to the corporate globalists and banking interests to feed on his country's underclasses in the 2000s.
Well, you know, its good to be unbanked since once an individual is "banked" they are invariably the host in a paracitical relationship that they, essentially, don't need. Especially not since Bitcoin came into existence.
Yet, many bleeding hearts and do-gooders will invoke sympathy for these "destitute" unbanked poor people that should, supposedly, be given credit, wage slavery, and internet for their proper civilization.
Even the big block Bitcoin Cargo Cult see these people as a target market for remitances and consumption in their blind greed for adoption-at-all-costs.
Their poverty and destitution cannot be solved by bank or Bitcoin money, nor does either hold the key to their political emancipation which is revolutionary and tied to the history of their caste relations, and to an extent colonialism and eventually, capitalism - in the same way that the British working class will not become financially independent and politically liberated only because of Bitcoin or their civilized status of being "banked".

no i don't think so., and here's why:
 A mindful contemplation of the nature of Bitcoin and how its degree of decentralization is directly related to cost of manufacture and a fee market leads to a logical conclusion that a policy of blocksize expansion leads to an outcome of insecurity and degradation.
If a compis mentis person is not capable of simulating this model in their mind, then it means that they either lack the mental framework (which can be acquired) or that they're intellectually incapable.

Ver talks a lot and has a history of challenging (and blaming, same thing) government. To his credit he has funded  insurgency against the criminal US government but was careless enough to get caught and indicted (perhaps due to youth) at the time.
If he seeks to challenge the US government then pressure via Bitcoin is arguably inviting unneeded attention to the whole ecosystem. Ver should talk straight and use his funds to lobby US political opposition rather than Bitcoin Consensus opposition. 
Even though he displays poor intellect in his support for big blocks (to this day), if he could hit the beast where it hurts, that would an achievement of international acclaim. But, cold-feet, he's waiting for a big blocked Bitcoin to do it in some imaginary maximum adoption scenario he perceives, while he nurtures a yellow Lamborghini in his personal hanger. Foolish and misguided behavior.

Consensus is all about informed opinion
And opinions go a long way, as Blues legend Taj Mahal relates it:


Opinion, yes, but informed and corroborated with experimental evidence.
Ver just flaps his lips and has not provided anything but "alleged" likelihood that a big blocksize will make more people come to the party. He fails to include notions of "Induced Demand" (more supply == more demand) as well as the market phenomenon whereby greater liquidity increases price volatility. None of it. I bet you he's not even aware of these phenomena, because he spends too much time talking and little time doing research in this new vista that has opened before humanity. Blabber mouth != science
Everything coming out his mouth is "Bitcoin is good", "more people using a good thing is double good", "Increasing blocksize will increase the number of users". Yeah, well if only it was this simple. Bitcoin is surprizingly difficult to scale if we are to retain its degree of decentralization and censorship resistance. Do we compromise the value of the thing itself for the sake of making it more popular? What is the objective gain of such a gain? Ver does not address this point in his stiff-eyed ramblings. Nor does he answer direct questions about this dilemma. What's he all about?

C'mon, man.
This the most naive layman's understanding of markets - and this is exactly what is being disputed - that more adoption equals price increases. Anyone who thinks this does not understand the dynamics of markets -&gt; why then is gold worth less in 2016 than it was in 2011 (if more people are using it?)
Why is the US dollar worth less in 2016 than in 2014? Are less people using it? Were there fewer Bitcoin adopters in 2013 than in 2015? The users more than doubled while price more than halved. Fact. No, speculation drives prices up and down. Margin, leverage and bets that last for years.
The point here is that, say you go to jail, and your primary objective is not to get done in the tailpipe - as government metaphorically likes to do to citizens. Then, would you go run around prison without your pants on and with a "Large Capacity" flag hanging out your ass?﻿
This is what Ver is proposing in his naive mindset that more adoption is the only real solution. Its naive. He's a dumb-ass for even thinking that and he proves his money-greed and lack of understanding by admitting to selling Bitcoin at early September 2016 - with even rudimentary speculative/chart knowledge he could have waited 2 days and gotten much more from the transaction, 2 weeks and the same, 2 months and a fortune more.
Participation in Bitcoin is not about increasing the price, its about increasing the security.
@_date: 2016-09-07 11:42:10
he allegedly admits he has sold "some" bitcoin for USD and a few altcoins. But he's unlikely to sell *a lot* since he's one of the [Cargo Cult]( priests who promote the misguided notion that bitcoin price is destined for $100,000 if we just build runways (block capacity) big enough for the delivery of an abundance of cargo (adoption).
There's a difference between starting Memory Dealers based on the trend whereby people, by Moore's Law, will require more and more computer memory (RAM) and transposing the same idea to Bitcoin. People do not objectively need more and more programmable, private money. But if the world's most powerful cryptocurrency could replace Visa and Western Union then it would be closer to the business model of Memory Dealers, right?
Yet, the process of becoming a large capacity payment network would be intrinsically bad for Bitcoin's core characteristics of decentralization and anti-state control.
Lacking (or flouting) this basic understanding is how most people know that Bitcoin Judas either lacks vision, or, is an intellectual midget. Both cases are undesirable for the security of my (and everybody's) bitcoin.

OK, yes, its all going wrong in fiat land.
Ironically, the dollar might outlast it all because of its international psychological significance. As I frequently say, even here in South East Asia market traders (and street cash markets make up 80% of regional sales) easily accept US dollar while they will refuse neighboring China's Yuan.
Why? Because the dollar has enjoyed decades of free publicity as the world's only superpower currency while SE Asians generally distrust the Chinese superiority complex in the region. So, dollars are more fungible than yuan, and both are more fungible than bitcoin - not because people are unaware of bitcoin but only because its exchange requires above-the-norm technology as well as connectivity. Most local markets lack both, and people will stick with local fiat for years or decades to come. The central banks in SE Asia are not inflating to the extent that the US, China, Japan and EU are doing.
Without any incentive and a valid fiat currency backed by legitimate good-hearted Buddhist kings, SE Asia does not suffer a fiat crisis, nor does it have an immediate need for digital currency.
The issue returns to the West and its copy-cats China and Japan, where central banks devaluation of the fiat currency is the blatant concern. But where fiat currency is respected, there is only marginal need for Bitcoin. Typically, the Bitcoin features as a programmable money are employed in business in SE Asia without much concern for the "Collapse Porn" that is preoccupying the West.
Cryptocurrency has a place and purpose but it is not the universal silver bullet, nor will - or *must* -  it replace known-good fiat in many lands.

Yes, and for all the use cases, security remains paramount if Bitcoin is to have meaning. Put another way: there is no intended use case that benefits from less network/protocol security.


It seems you imply that speculation is only one of the drivers of price movement. So, for example, in a given week a 1000 new adopters might each buy 1 bitcoin. Let's say price starts the week at $500. Their buying should have the effect of pushing price higher, right? Say, to $510. Yet, there probably is at least one intra-week speculator who bought 1000 BTC at $480 the previous week, and who will be compelled, by his speculation time-frame, to sell 1000 BTC and lower the price back to $500.
So many things have a bearing on price and on market psychology, but speculation is the main driver of trends. This is not my idea about it, btw, this is the generally accepted understanding of price chart behavior.


This seems to be the general truth of it, agreed.


Well, my register of language certainly doesn't suit everybody's sensibilities, so fair point. In my previous comment I did say "ass", granted, but I also did euphemize with "tail pipe". A "dumb ass" is a donkey.
I perceive that this kind of online forum rarely features intellectual debate - it does happen on occasion between agreeable parties - but in general - especially with populist notions - its a fight club. Less about changing the mind of the other (by tediously starting every discussion from first principles) and more about breaking down lazy thinking and ridiculing these ideas' populist proponents.
The idea that increased adoption will increase price is a popular misconception in the same way that increased rainfall does not raise the level of the ocean. Increased adoption will increase the *value* of Bitcoin but, as the market truism goes: "never confuse price with value". We want more value for Bitcoin, yes, and this is back to my original axiom: protocol security (via secure code and a high degree of decentralization) is what ultimately gives Bitcoin meaning. Even in the case of pervasive global adoption, without fundamental security, Bitcoin will be meaningless and valueless. 
Ver, and almost every other big blocks advocate, is proposing that we sacrifice security (degree of decentralization) for the gain of greater adoption. Why? Some deduce that they are interested in the price increased because of the logical fallacy that greater adoption == price increase. Whatever their true motivation, they fail to comprehend the inherent fragility of Bitcoin - its vulnerability to centralized control and subsequent failure.
There are many other reasons to be conservative with changes to blocksize. One for example, is the principle of [Induced Demand]( that affects large networks. According to this phenomenon larger blocks risk corporate[World Bank study](

From a certain perspective there is no control of the economy - only folly and manipulation. That governments or central banks have control is a popular myth, that central authorities encourage to make themselves useful and that the majority believe without any sound evidence for it.
From this perspective it is the manipulation that leads to adverse economic reactions (crises, crashes) because the economy is a super organism that represents the productive (and unproductive) activity of society and the globe. Like any organism it must have phases of growth and phases of contraction (rest, sleep). But if it is manipulated to only ever grow and never rest, then it asserts itself with a violent reaction (crash, depression).
In the depths of recession/depression the seeds of the new growth phase begin to sprout. It is an interesting fact that government and central banks - like all market participants - are always caught off-guard by market crashes, in other words they cannot predict it and they fail to see it coming.

IMO the current Core collective can do little wrong. It should continue to steer Bitcoin development as it has proven it can do until now. It's Open Source dev model, Meritocracy and Consensus ensure a slow boat for change of the protocol. 
Anyone interested in changing Bitcoin should build trust and reputation by earning merit in Core and then propose. The growing popularity of soap boxing by business interests echoes hollow as ever.
Bitcoin businesses and miners are only participants as long as the user base and Core tolerate them. The idea that business interests drive Bitcoin or are even necessary  is false. Bitcoin can work without any and every Bitcoin-based business out there, including the miner manufacturers and exchanges.

It is unlikely she is talking about Bitcoin when she refers to "virtual currencies" - according to previous statements by Fed officers and anti-cash man Lawrence Summers, the central banks intend to create national cryptocurrencies, such as the cryptodollar to replace physical cash. These will still be fiat currencies and will have no semblance to Bitcoin's decentralized censorship resistance.
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:46:22
The central bank cryptocurrencies will still be fiat - only digital. Bitcoin solves the double-spending problem, so it is now possible for central banks to do away with anonymous paper cash and "upgrade" to fully traceable digital fiat currency.
Although fiat crypto will seem like an innovation to most people, those who understand Bitcoin's value - decentralization, censorship-resistance and no central authority, will continue valuing it. It is its privacy protection and the existence of fiat (debt economy) that makes Bitcoin valuable and fiat crypto is no threat to it. If anything, fiat crypto will strengthen Bitcoin.

I think most users agree that Bitcoin is sound money and a store of value.
However, it is not an anti-dote to economic turmoil. Economic turmoil can take multiple forms and the most likely manifestation we face is *credit deflation* - popping of a bubble of 40 years of non-stop growth fueled by untethered fiat credit expansion.
During a deflationary period cash becomes more valuable. Since bitcoin is cash it should appreciate through the course of a deflation. Paradoxically, fiat cash also becomes more valuable, since the evaporating credit causes money in circulation to appreciate.
However, we don't know how many bitcoin in this ecosystem were bought on debt. During a tough economic recession, people need cash to survive. Most shops and services accept fiat, but very few accept bitcoin. Hence, as is typically the case with precious metals, we could see bitcoin sell off at the start of a crisis as holders flee to more fungible cash.
By the end of a vanilla crisis bitcoin should be more valuable and perhaps its price much higher as a result.
I say "vanilla" because the common denominator of all previous credit crashes had been that the catalyst came out of left field - unforeseen and unanticipated by all. It could very well be that a future economic crisis is caused by a solar flare, in which case many bitcoin will be lost to electro-magnetic effects - shrinking the supply and increasing the eventual price dramatically.
I've written a collection of articles about fiat, credit, deflation and Bitcoin because the topic is extensive and mainstream economics has no clue:

There are technical aspects of Bitcoin that new users should understand - things that non-computer science people have not needed to comprehend until now. Without knowledge of these technical aspects new users could easily lose their bitcoin.
Coinbase has become a popular choice and recommendation of exchange, but users of that exchange should know that Coinbase (and others) apply KYC and AML. Once you buy (or sell) bitcoin with such exchanges your identity is linked to your addresses and transactions in an international bank/police database. This is not how Bitcoin is intended to be used.
It seems many Bitcoiners believe that increased adoption (at any cost) will lead to price increases. This is provably not the case. Bitcoin utility (value) is driven by fundamentals such as its security and supply/demand. Bitcoin's price chart is driven by speculation. While fundamentals and price seem to be correlated, in fact, they are not.
As the saying goes:


To take advantage of the speculative price waves one should buy low and sell high. Trying to dumb down best practice and Bitcoin technicals, as a means of rising the price, is ill-informed and only weakens Bitcoin security for everyone.

Satoshi is absolutely clear that his only golden rule for Bitcoin is *Consensus* - that changes to the protocol only be made if there is near-unanimous (95%) agreement.
**The notion that Bitcoin should scale is not in contention** (I think we all agree), but there is contention about *how* it should scale, and rightfully so. That a quickfix (and potentially disastrous) blocksize increase is being approached with caution is how it should be, according to the Rule of Consensus.


Note that Satoshi uses the term *generate*, meaning to mine. He is clearly referring to miner nodes and not validating fullnodes in those server farms. Logically, if you're not a miner, the incentive to run an expensive fullnode is to validate the blockchain and your own transactions. That's the use-case.

Layer 2 protocols such as Lightning will allow 100s of thousands of almost instant micro-transactions at very low fees.

On-chain transaction fees will always fluctuate according to usage demand patterns. Right now, usage is high, but at the market bottom it will be very low and so will fees. This is just part and parcel of Bitcoin.

To frame it that experienced traders *fleeced* newbies misrepresents how markets work and what drives speculative psychology.
As most of the replies echo, all markets rally strongest when the "herd" and late-comers pile in.
Late-comers exuberantly join the uptrend when they start hearing about it in the media and from acquaintances. It comes to their attention and they want to also benefit from the upside. This is long after the early birds (who put in the time, tears and sweat) have already taken their speculative risk near the bottom.
The late-comers, with little experience of proportion in the market, join the bull-run and blow off the market - and those that have held for months or years start seeing signs of a top.
No-one can call the exact top - legendary traders admit to this fact - but experienced traders start preparing for the risk of a sell-off while the herd looks to the skies.
Its how markets have always been. Successful speculation is a game that requires skill at risk management and a dose of luck. To cast buy-low-sell-high as "fleecing" is not an accurate characterization.

The amount of bitcoin you send (output) via a transaction does not determine the size of the transaction. Fees are applied *per byte* and the byte size of a transaction is usually around 250 bytes.
Sometimes, even if you only want to send a small bitcoin amount, it needs to be constituted from various previously received amounts present in your wallet. These are called the *inputs* to your transaction. Each input adds approx 180 bytes to the transaction. Your wallet software makes some algorithmic decisions to try optimise the number of inputs to a transaction. Unless you get under the hood on the command line you won't have much say in the selection process.
The more inputs to a transaction, the larger it will be and the higher the fees you will need to pay if you want miners to include it in the next block.
Here is a technical description:

It's fair to say that a large portion of users and the majority of the 100+ contributors to Core agree with "the eight" you seem to blame.

That's the bottom line with Consensus.

Three misrepresentations in your statement:
1) you assume that people only work for a financial incentive
2) some of the current devs have been involved since the beginning; many may have large holdings of bitcoin
3) open source development is a meritocracy and in Bitcoin's case operates by consensus. Anyone who wants to add a feature can do so - if 95% of the 100+ contributors agree to it then it can be implemented. 
So its not a case that any one dev (or a few) can determine which features are added (or not added).
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:56:05
The exact definitions of the terms "soft fork" and "hard fork" means that the BIP148 UASF is indeed a *soft fork*.
The primary miner blocking SegWit is AntPool, run by BitMain, the miner with majority hash rate on the network. CEO Jihan Wu, has  stated that he "might" be blocking SegWit precisely because it represents a reduction in fees, eventhough SegWit is actually "a good thing" for Bitcoin. In this sense, the miner's profit motive cannot be demonized, and should be expected.
That Jihan Wu and Roger Ver have an explicit agreement is not a cold fact. It is clear that each benefits from the other's obstruction.
It is a common perception that larger blocks will result in lower fees. However, it can be demonstrated that the opposite is true in large scale networks, such as transport, healthcare and Bitcoin. What real world studies actually find is that by increasing supply there is a counter-intuitive increase in demand, according to the Law of Induced Demand.
Hence, increasing blocksize will simply see an equivalent increase in transactions and fee rates will remain high.

Bitcoin is censorship-resistant. Like BitTorrent. The amount of revenue being lost to piracy by media companies is massive. Yet, they're powerless to stop it or even say "ban it".
The central banks, their satellites and large corporations are clamoring over oneanother to try and implement this very Bitcoin technology. When they lobby for government to ban Bitcoin in favor of their own centralized digital currencies, it will only strengthen Bitcoin's *real* use-case - the function it was designed for: anti-state money.
Banning might not be inevitable, but it will be pointless.

Good idea, yet, what you describe is the mechanism by which SPV (light) clients operate, as described in the whitepaper.
There is incentive for users to have their own copy of the entire blockchain for the purpose of verifying it - and *their own transactions* - against the protocol's consensus rules.
Entrusting even a portion of the data to a third party reduces security and creates opportunities for attack.
Even so, if we reduce your proposal of a torrent-style sharded block chain to its practical implementation, then there would need to be a complete version of the blockchain held *somewhere* on the network as the definitive reference for determining chaintip, orphan blocks, etc. This reintroduces the dilemma of centralization.

My comment re: Litecoin is not scathing. I mean to say it is more suitable for particular use-cases where Bitcoin's high fees and current txn unreliability presents an obstacle. For example a trader transferring funds between exchange accounts - its cheaper and faster via LTC.
So, indeed, it also has 1MB blocks but its blocks are not full, hence its cheap and fast. That's what most Big Blockers would like to see for Bitcoin - that's the feature and network condition I'm referring to in the comment above.
Perhaps that explains my reference to Litecoin - not the technical parameters but the state of its network.
Your point about SegWit...
It's interesting that those who are anti-SegWit and in favor of Big Blocks do not present technical or security arguments for their choice. The reason given is always emotive: that Bitcoin stands to lose users to other cryptocurrencies; that Bitcoin stands to lose its "first mover" advantage; that Bigger Blocks will reduce fees (a baseless myth dream, as discussed above). The assumption behind all of these reasons is presumably that increasing adoption will increase price - another fallacy that has no historical precedent in markets.

Bitcoin is an open source software project so anyone can contribute. There is no holding company or compensation - only a collection of individuals working according to an open source ethos, by definition, voluntarily - because they find the project interesting.
Some companies and individuals need to develop certain functionality in the reference client (Core), so it makes sense for them to pay select developers to implement those features. 
Of course, there has to be consensus among all developers and contributors about proposed features before they can be implemented, i.e. a company cannot force contentious changes simply because they are willing to pay. The open source ethos (and consensus) comes first, the salaries come second.

Fair point, but remember Bitcoin is not about just any old transaction - its about being able to make trustless transactions without anyone's permission. Traditional (fiat) transactions can be accomplished (more cheaply than Bitcoin) with fiat cash and cards, but Bitcoin is programmable money with a censorship-resistant network. Not owned by the state or bankers and when the transactions need to be beyond their surveillance or say-so - that's when Bitcoin comes into its own. Many people are willing to pay double today's fees and wait twice as long for that feature.
Bitcoin is good for certain use cases but not for all transaction for all people. Sometimes an altcoin is more suitable, sometimes plain old fiat cash. For Bitcoin to be useful it does not require that all other forms of money or barter disappear.

Yes, the protocol could be changed in any way, including to make mining less profitable. Its not a simple matter making such significant changes, but it is possible if there is consensus for a fundamental protocol change. However, I'd argue that a healthy Bitcoin network requires a healthy mining industry, so mining should be profitable for a large number of miners.
What is evident, is that the speculative cycle tends to determine mining profitability. During price rallies more miners join since fees go up, block rewards are worth more (in fiat - they have to pay major bills in fiat) and mining is therefore more profitable. During medium- or long-term price declines mining becomes unprofitable and miners leave. There have been times (e.g. most of 2015) when bitcoin price was below the cost of mining, meaning miners were actually losing money by mining. Of course, with fewer miners around, mining was easier, so those miners who persisted (played the long game) eventually are rewarded.

Well, as you imply, i guess government can force Bitcoin underground. That scenario will mean it is less easy to buy and sell - perhaps, illegal. However, that has never stopped trade and use of commodities people like or find useful, right?

Exactly. Key insight, and glad to hear it spoken matter-of-factly.
Adoption increased measurably during 2014, yet price declined throughout. By 2015 adoption increased by orders of magnitude yet price remained below $500 (less than half the 2013 rally top) despite the undeniable supply/demand dynamic.
Price and value are not correlated. Speculation drives the price chart.

From this response it seems like your actual question is: "will SegWit increase the price of bitcoin?" - which you should have stated clearly, rather than ending up exasperated with people answering your question "what is segwit?"
The answer is "yes", the prospect of SegWit has pushed price above $1000 once again, but as price speculation goes, it is the anticipation of the event that raises price and not the event itself. By the time SegWit is actually ~~adopted~~ activated bitcoin will likely be in a bear market already.

Litecoin's code base seems to be almost identical to Bitcoin - except for the Scrypt hashing algo, as you say.
The major difference between them is in their network size, market capitalization and goodwill. Bitcoin's network represents the largest supercomputer on earth and it is more widely spendable (more Bitcoin users and merchants).
I guess its fair to say that their capacity for censorship-resistance is equivalent, but that Bitcoin's network size gives it greater security/resistance.

Some years ago I was supporting proposals that blocksize be increased. Then someone asked me: 


So, I started asking myself those questions and those around me, and realized that most people could not give convincing answers, and that there was a lot of imagination and emotion and misguided hopes and dreams at work.
The idea that increasing supply in response to an increase in demand will solve anything is refuted by modern research in large capacity networks. The not-so-intuitive clincher is that **demand quickly fills available supply** - its called the Principle of [Induced Demand](
The Big Block movement has uncanny similarities to [Cargo Cult](

However, I must add that your misrepresentation (framing) of Gregory Maxwell's statements above is underhanded. Furthermore, framing "the eight" (as you call them) as being villains, or out of consensus, is misrepresentation and provably untrue.

@_date: 2017-05-03 00:54:06


This is not the state of affairs. Let me nutshell it for you:
SegWit code became production ready around Nov 2016 and miners must now signal "segwit" for 95% of blocks for SegWit to activate across the network.
Once activated (by 95% miner signalling) one of the first steps is to double blocksize. This code and roadmap was openly discussed by the core devs during the past 2 years and they did their part and have moved on to code other optimizations for Bitcoin.
It's been up to miners for 5 months already. However, the largest mining pool, AntPool (and others) is refusing to signal SegWit because as Jihan Wu, the CEO of the largest miner manufacturer, BitMain, explained: miners prefer the current high-fee condition because it is profitable and SegWit represents a lower income future for miners.
Litecoin miners have successfully signalled SegWit for activation within a week or so. This will be a proof-of-concept in an altcoin, although the core devs have already thoroughly tested SegWit in Bitcoin.


There is talk of a user activated soft fork (UASF) whereby fullnode operators could signal SegWit, activate it, and bypass the deadlock being imposed by those miners who are blocking acttivation.


What's "first mover advantage"? And why does Bitcoin need it?

You're brave to say it because there are so many hopes and dreams pinned on Bitcoin that its easy to provoke a fight. 
Mass adoption seems to be the common thread in the many myth visions for Bitcoin: that it will become the international reserve, the One global currency, save the world and end poverty. And make every hodler rich.
Mass adoption is commonly believed to be the holy grail of most of those religio-fundamentalist yearnings., so people can get pretty upset when one suggests that mass adoption may not ever happen - that Bitcoin does not require it to happen. Fact remains: Bitcoin does not have to do any of those fantastical things to remain useful.
As for the astounding complexity you allude to... many of the core devs have admitted that there are aspects of the protocol and code base that they don't fully comprehend. (Devs tend to specialize in an aspect of the protocol). 
But with that said, my 70 year old mother installed Android Bitcoin wallet, signed up for an online exchange and taught herself how to buy/sell, send and receive bitcoin. If she can do it... then mass adoption is indeed possible! 
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:36:48
Via Lightning and other Layer 2 protocols the fees should be very low, but Bitcoin itself (Layer 1) is a behemoth: slow, unreliable and expensive - its just simply the trade-off for security and censorship-resistance. So, I reckon that in coming years and decades it could get very expensive at times.
It all depends on what fees people are willing to pay for its scarce blockspace and security. If I must pay ransom via BTC for my daughter's life, I'll pay a $1000 fee to make sure  the tx gets confirmed during busy network times.
If I want to quickly and cheaply move funds between exchange accounts, I use Litecoin.
Future scenarios will differ, because things are evolving so fast, and we just don't know where this cryptobeast is going, right?

Your argument is valid and shared by many who value Bitcoin's fundamental feature of censorship-resistance. Let us not forget that this innovation comes from a cypherpunk who remains anonymous and private to this day!
A naive majority does not perceive the threats of latter-day government, pay-rolled - not with taxes - but by loans from Big Business.  Lobbied by interest groups and well-funded reactionary think-tanks. 
The view that finance capital and its political lackeys will simply watch Bitcoin happen, with arms folded, is indeed naive and those harboring such views may likely choose to sleepwalk forever. The main proponents of Big Blocks, already on the payroll of finance capital, are preying on exactly this naivety, and lack of comprehension to garner popular support for weakening Bitcoin's fundamental security.
And its not like these proponents - and finance capital itself - do not understand the principle of [Induced Demand](
One can argue that they are all too familiar with the dynamic and what it will mean for congestion, tx fees and Bitcoin's security. They fail to acknowledge the principle precisely because that's exactly the outcome they seek.

Consensus rule does not operate by democracy or compromise. Adam Back and Jihan Wu cannot and should not make decisions for Bitcoin.

That's not what the point made by the analysis. It points to the confirmations of continuing advance or decline.
This may not be useful to buy-and-hold traders but to a leveraged trader a price movement of even $20 offers 100s of dollars worth of profit. So, those confirmations, levels and targets are useful to some - not as a revelation - but as a supplement to their own analysis.

Not sure what your actual question is, but this might be the answer:
Bitcoin's security is dependent on there being many nodes that make up its p2p network. The nodes should be owned by many people,  as opposed to most nodes being owned by a single entity. The many nodes should be diverse (non-similar) and distributed (evenly scattered).
The more numerous the nodes, and the more diverse and distributed they are, the higher the degree of *Decentralization* of the network.
The same principle applies to the subset of nodes that are miners. They should be numerous, owned by diverse interests and distributed evenly across the network. 
These are the ideal characteristics but in practice there is a tendency toward centralization whereby a few entities control the majority of hash power. 
The actual hash rate number is less important. What is important for Bitcoin to be more secure, is that the **hash rate should be distributed among as many, diverse miners as possible**. Hence, when miners leave or new miners have no incentive to join, the diversity and distribution of mining nodes is lower. The effect is a lower degree of decentralization and less security.
Here is an analysis article that explores mining from the perspective of hash rate, difficulty and profitablity:

It's like this: it is possible to shard an *existing* file (e.g. movie) across a p2p network, but its a chicken-and-egg puzzle trying to render a movie in shards across the network *while its being filmed and edited* - live and on different nodes! :)

Because Bitcoin has no central controller and floats in the open market it will forever be subject to volatile price speculation, trading as a commodity rather than a currency.
National fiat currencies appear stable because their controlling central banks manipulate their prices around the clock to keep up the facade of stability - for the sake of creating confidence in national trade, industry and finance.
@_date: 2017-05-13 05:04:05
Based on economic supply/demand dynamics, in isolation, bitcoin price must increase by orders of magnitude. Everyone can sense this intuitively.
What is counter-intuitive, and more difficult to comprehend, is that fundamental forces are not the only vector on price. 
Speculative dynamics - and bitcoin floats in a forever unregulated open market - means that price could be at $500k on 1 Jan 2030 and at $1000 again by 2031. Waves of buying and selling for profit (speculation) is what has kept similar commodities like gold below its fundamental price projection for centuries.
@_date: 2017-05-13 09:30:12
You touch on many aspects and issues. In a nutshell: 
 - Bitcoin is beta software and it's future will be determined by society's consensus. 
 - As long as it remains censorship-resistant and decentralized Bitcoin is succeeding in its design goal.
 - Bitcoin's success does not depend on adoption - whether in the developing or developed world, a la point 2)
Besides, technical know-how in the developing world is much greater than most people imagine. However, the notion of engaging the "unbanked poor" has its origins in the banking sector, where the quest for additional customers to charge and lend to has spun a narrative that the unfortunate souls need to be banked for humanitarian reasons. Having a bank account does not solve the root political causes that underpin economic disadvantage, right?
Hence, rural poor do not need bank accounts, they generally get paid weekly wages in cash and conduct day-to-day transactions for living and commerce in a combination of fiat cash and barter. So, they don't need Bitcoin either, in most cases.
Also worth expressing the opinion that the entrenched financial system is not immediately threatened by Bitcoin. Its more like a slow burn over decades. Bitcoin's primary utility is not in threatening the centralized authorities, but that a well maintained Bitcoin allows its users to conduct transactions without the permission or say-so of these 3rd parties.

I can second the recommendation to youtube talks by Andreas Antonopoulos, and also suggest this site:
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:59:27
Andreas Antonopoulos's metaphor of the Lion and the Shark is relevant here:
In the cryptoverse, Bitcoin is the flagship - the most robust, the most secure, and the trade-off of these characteristics is a lack of flexibility, difficulty in scaling, and an expensive blockchain (limited space, high fees).
The Lion and the Shark are both apex predators in their respective environments, but they cannot compete in each other's ecosystems.
Bitcoin is good for certain functions and use-cases, but unsuitable for others. Some other cryptocurrencies/blockchains, rightfully, fill (and will fill in future) the other niches.
I'm not implying that you're saying Bitcoin should be cheap or meet every use-case, but the maximalist idea is out there that Bitcoin must be all things to all people and suitable to every use case. The idea is unreasonable and illogical. The Big Blocker vision that Bitcoin's security should be sacrificed to make it more like Litecoin is preposterous and simply the result of lazy thinking !

Remittance is one use-case and definitely not the primary function of Bitcoin.
Censorship-resistance is arguably the fundamental value of Bitcoin, since it can become unsuitable for any one use-case and still remain useful for others. But without censorship-resistance Bitcoin becomes meaningless.
Low fees has never been the explicit design criterion of Bitcoin. In fact, Satoshi's design has Bitcoin mining eventually become entirely dependent on fees. Fee rates will always fluctuate according to economic conditions: currently we have dominant miners blocking progress precisely because they want to persist the lucrative high fee rates. Once this rally has run its course (as they always do) there will be a slump in transaction count and fees will come down - even if miners continue blocking SegWit. Its just to-be-expected fluctuation. Trying to manipulate fees lower returns us to the central bank model of policy interference. The fees will and must fluctuate, and users and miners will take advantage of those fluctuations for their economic purposes.
Many altcoins are now more suitable for transferring small amounts. Once SegWit activates this use-case will return to Bitcoin: almost instant micro-payments with low fees.
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:11:45
In a way, you're asking for a simple explanation of both cryptography and plausible conceptual separation. 10yr-olds just don't have the necessary mental frameworks to understand the concepts adequately. If defense against an overbearing adversary was child's-play then we'd have pubescent military minds. If computer science was intuitive then we'd have kids coding Bitcoin. You see? It's like explaining to a never-experienced youngster how to be a lady-killer - impossible - there is some personal experience and mileage required. 
When you continually place digitally signed envelopes inside other digitally signed envelopes, eventually you end up with a final signature on the outer-most envelope. This final signature can be manipulated to forge a transaction before it is confirmed. Segregated Witness places transaction signatures in their own separate database (referencing, but away from the bitcoin being moved) which solves the issue of transaction spoofing (aka transaction malleability) and allows many other security and efficiency benefits for the Bitcoin blockchain.
The reason why we want to avoid transaction malleability (first mined, first confirmed) is because we want every intended transaction to be considered valid, and for the user to be able to explicitly reverse the transaction, before it is confirmed, without the risk of spoofing. 
SegWit does this, and a lot more, but it requires study of the resources posted in this thread for comprehension.

So, basically, everything that Bitcoin users and developers value, and Satoshi Nakamoto's design is just a bad idea?


This might be the misunderstanding. Bitcoin's design and characteristics makes it unsuitable as everyday cash. It's primary utilities are as a programmable money, secure value storage, a censorship-resistant ledger and a solution to digital double spending. 
This combination of features makes Bitcoin's blockchain layer more suitable to be a public settlement network rather than a micro-transaction payment network.
SegWit enables second layer protocols that will allow almost unlimited, near-instant micro-transactions at very low fees - using bitcoin and settling to the main chain periodically.
Does that sound like what you describe?

Litecoin is good for small, fast transactions. And today SegWit activates on the Litecoin network.

If we look at it from a high level, we can see that Bitcoin is not the solution to the current finance capital dilemma, but the obvious way for what will follow.
As many thinkers in the fields of civilization and economics have pointed out: Finance Capital must run its inevitable course. Bitcoin's design and characteristics means it cannot be retro-fitted to the ailing financial system.
Bitcoin requires that we slow down our spending, plan our transactions, and  choose to transact frugally on productive outcomes.

I want to answer you sincerely, and believe you'll understand that I cannot disclose how and where I obtain my bitcoin. Certainly, bank satellite exchanges (fiat &lt;-&gt; btc) are not the only means of buying and selling. 
Your characterization "libertarian wet dream... that will take them all down" does not describe my view of Bitcoin's role and future. While this (blockchain) technology is still in its infancy, and will lead to all kinds of interesting outcomes, many people are careful not to overestimate its significance. Bitcoin has a permanent and important place in society, but does not require that all other currencies disappear for it to continue fulfilling its design goal of censorship-resistance and permissionless transactions.
These polarized visions are exactly what lie behind the blocksize debate. There are those who believe Bitcoin has specific, limited use-cases; and those who believe it should become the de facto standard and dominant global currency. I agree that the latter impulse is naive.
If Bitcoin could be useful to every person on the planet, that would be ideal. Yet, we understand that, for the foreseeable future, it will only be useful to a sub-sector of the population for very specific use-cases. General and pervasive adoption and finance revolution is far-fetched because Bitcoin is contrary to the axioms of finance capital.

No the 2MB hard fork, scheduled for Oct/Nov is being coded by an ex-Core contributor called Jeff Garzik.

It's not about "choking blocksize". As the article discusses, the phenomenon of Induced Demand warns us that in large public networks, increases in capacity often lead to increases in demand, and no effective relief from the congestion it attempts to solve.
Instead, other solutions need to be considered and implemented, *in addition to* capacity (block size) increase.

The CS and logistic of incrementing blocksize by 0.1MB have far-reaching negative effects on network security. If we degrade security we degrade CR. It's complex and not many people perceive (or even believe that). Hence, my conclusion that the two camps are irreconcilable. 
For example, we probably agree that increasing blocksize to 1GB has consequences for the network. One can ask: does it increase or decrease decentralization and, therefore, security? Moving that scale around between 2MB and 1GB, where is the sweetspot. How do we measure and test that?
But I've never *once* heard a blocksize increase proponent offer an answer to - or even an acknowledgement of - that critical security consideration.
I'd like to understand your point about Blockstream reducing usability by limiting transaction space. You mean to say Blockstream is trying to harm Bitcoin, its users and ecosystem by, on purpose, limiting blockspace?

The statement is itself a belief and not absolute Truth. 
It can be argued that what supports the US dollar's value is international *faith* in the US dollar. It is possible to exchange USD anywhere in the world, officially or on the street, because people have "faith" in its value. Fundamentally, the USD is fiat currency - worthless - and default on USD denominated debt is a major calamity waiting to happen.
From this perspective, the US dollar's value is propped up by its issuer, the Fed, who have consistently been devaluing it via fractional reserve lending (runaway credit) for more than a century. So, a confidence trick.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, does not have value because someone says so ("fiat"). Bitcoin has no central issuer or policy maker, hence its supply cannot be altered as a means of manipulating its price.
Bitcoin has value because it is useful, cryptographically secure and its ledger censorship-resistant. That's its value. Its price is open to speculation in the open market. Bitcoin price does not reflect its value, since Bitcoin had the same value at $200 in 2015 as it does now at $2000. Speculative value (price) and utility value (fundamental characteristics) are not necessarily correlated in open markets.
Hence, Bitcoin has value because of its features. These features are safeguarded by its characteristics of being decentralized and operating by consensus. As long as it retains these core characteristics it will remain useful, secure and beyond the reach of the state or any other third party.
The fiat currencies of the world do not share any of the above features. If they did, Bitcoin would be less useful and perhaps not even needed.

Agree on every point.
Addressing the OP, the important thing to realize is that UASF is not subject to a majority or consensus of nodes. It is happening 100% for sure on 1 August: a new chain tip will split off a chain that can only be built with SegWit signalling blocks (onus on miners).
Users/businesses/miners will have to decide on what chain they're on before they can transact. Transacting on the wrong chain will see those transactions lost.
Trace Mayer gives the example of Alice buying Bob's condo. If Alice and Bob transact on the chain that gets discarded then Alice has the condo and gets her bitcoin back. Bob has neither.
That's an extreme and easily reversible example, but think about the current daily transaction volume and fees worth $1mil+ going to miners on a daily basis. Businesses and miners will have to commit decisively or lose big.
The UASF is a watershed event and it is coming.

It is possible, theoretically, but human life-span constrains the effort.
Bearing in mind that the Bitcoin network is currently the world's largest super computer, and using its existing hash power, it would take approx 0.65 billion billion years to break one address.
But cracking all keys at the same time is implausible. When it becomes evident that one or more keys have been broken, then the developers would simply change the encryption and hash parameters to something stronger for users to substitute.

At the moment fees are just a bonus - the block reward of 12.5 BTC is primary income.
For the majority of miners it is not an option whether to mine or not.
They have invested large amounts of money in the gear, must hire datacenters and pay staff. At the end of the month they have to pay salaries, rent/mortgages, and that massive electricity bill.
Pissed or not. They're obligated by circumstance and financial commitments to mine.
Besides fees, every block they don't mine means a potential 12.5 BTC lost to another miner.

It can be nut-shelled like this:
The commonality between GS, JPM, et al (shadow banks) and traditional banks is that both sectors are insiders to the global fiat credit scam run by the central bank network.
The difference between shadow banks and traditional banks is that the shadow banking sector is unregulated. Decades of Wall Street govt has engineered it that way. The shadow banks are therefore free to dabble in cryptocurrency as a means of 1) generating profit, and 2) testing the water on behalf of central banks before they convert national fiat currencies to fiat cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin exchanges, for example, have to kowtow the traditional banks' regulations, because they are answerable to them as bank sector dependents (satellites) by virtue of being money changers and transmitters.
But Bitcoin exchanges and cryptocurrency creators (altcoin makers and boards) must take orders from the shadow banks, because they can be legally done-in if they don't toe the line: exchanges because they're muscling in on shadow bank turf, and crypto creators and boards for creating currency - a federal crime.
They can only do business, beyond a point, with the blessing and approval of the shadow banks who have historically (and legally) been granted this unregulated territory.
Hence, a guy like Tone Vays - in his youtube blog - calls XRP, ETH, etc outright scams. As I understand it, he's worked for an investment (shadow) bank and is well experienced to see when their hand is in the pie.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin - everything we value about it. But where it intersects with finance capital there's need for caution: buy your bitcoin anonymously, avoid centrally controlled cryptocurrency, and store your bitcoin in a wallet that you fully own and control.

As other comments point out there is no vote involved. The planned UASF requires SegWit capable fullnodes to enforce BIP148 on 1 August 2017 which in turn should twist miners' arms to start signaling SegWit for activation.
The original roadmap for SegWit activation relied on almost unanimous signaling by miners. However, since some powerful miners are not signaling (presumably to prolong high fee profits) there is a deadlock and SegWit stands no chance of being activated in the present situation.
UASF requires that fullnode operators add code to their nodes that enforces a workaround to miner signaling, the workaround is called BIP148. The hoped-for outcome of the UASF offensive is that miners act rationally and "jump ship" and start signaling for SegWit activation with every new block they mine on the SegWit-only chain that is (hopefully) created by softfork on 1 August 2017.
UASF on 1 Aug seems an inevitability, but participation is still low, and UASF is not the only way forward. It can be argued that once the rally blows off (as all rallies do), that fee rates will decline, along with price, and that miners will no longer have an incentive to block SegWit. The original SegWit roadmap will then make sense and unfold as planned.
Whichever way SegWit signaling manifests, according to the timelines and conditions baked into the Core client code, its actual activation and implementation is still at least a year away.

The core principle is that Bitcoin should remain censorship-resistant. Without this characteristic its no better than a Fedcoin.
Rallies always see an increase in the number of txns. Demand for limited block space chases up fees.
By the time the speculative frenzy has crashed price, fees will decrease even though block size remains the same.
So, firstly, it does not make sense to increase block size (reduce security and censorship-resistance) every time there is a rally or increased demand.
Secondly, the height of the rally is not limited by block size. We know this because speculative blow-offs have happened in the past without the block size limit being hit - although number of txns and fee rates increased.
Like any large scale network (e.g. public transport, healthcare), Bitcoin will experience periods of peak usage and low usage, regardless of its capacity.

That's a valiant write up! I did read it from beginning to end.
The immediate concern is with the storage of 10MB blocks. They will erode security fundamentally because the associated storage costs will price out many of the smaller miners and, thereby, increases centralization and decreases the diversity aspect of decentralization.
Also, a reduction in the number of users running full nodes can be expected - not only due to the increased storage costs but due to the additional volume, latency and processing burden of having the increased protocol traffic and, presumably, 10x the number of transactions.
A fullnode is a user's primary security in terms of verifying the blockchain and their own transactions. Not being able to afford to run a fullnode reduces Bitcoin's meaning since users are priced out based on either 1) their relative income, or 2) in favor of a mining class who can afford to operate the means of verification and production. This brings us full-circle back to the origins of capitalism and inequality that emerged from the industrial revolution.
So, as block size increases, so network diversity, decentralization, and ultimately *security* decreases. The developers discussed this topic at length some years ago in the public mailing list, and eventually consensus was reached that blocksize was the wrong parameter to tweak in order to scale Bitcoin. 
A few developers, notably Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn and Jeff Garzik did not seem to "get" the impact of Induced Demand. They never mentioned it, negated questions about it, and shifted attention to the crisis of rising fees and that raising blocksize would allow temporary relief from high fees. Ironically, Induced Demand, implies that bigger blocks would soon see the same congestion, and same high fee rates return. 
But still this Big Block camp persisted - contrary to the science and with no case studies and no lab simulations to back their case - only emotional talk of fee danger and loss of network effect. They even went so far as to start lobbying businesses and miners to support their research-less blocksize increase program. That was 2014-2015 and today we see that their plan has come to fruition. 
But there is a caveat:
Bitcoin was born from the cypherpunk movement. Satoshi is a cypherpunk as are many of the early adopters and current developers. The cypherpunks have a vested interest in Bitcoin for its realization of a censorship-resistant tool against the state's erosion of citizens' privacy. The cypherpunks hold vast amounts of bitcoin and the braintrust of this innovation. They are not going to relinquish it so businessmen and the very banks that Bitcoin negates, so these corporate interests can turn a profit from the orange-and-white genie. If they could do that with Bitcoin as-is, that would be fine, but their primary objective is to degrade security and increase centralization by raising the blocksize limit.
Of course, some will argue that the cypherpunks are too extreme and should give some slack so the businesses can banks can increase adoption. Whatever their argument, the fact remains that anyone can fork Bitcoin and start a new altcoin and give it all the experimental characteristics they think the world might need. That is fair and well and the Big Blockers are free to do that and invite the banks to their altcoin.
But they'll have to fork. They cannot have *this* Bitcoin.

The hard fork is scheduled for Oct/Nov. Upgrade to 2MB blocks is contentious. Hence, many users will not follow the fork and the Bitcoin Core project are not planning to include code in the Core client to follow the fork. Hence, there will be a chain-split.
That is the self-evident outcome of current developments.

The comparison is made in the broadest sense and nothing derogatory is implied. Human beings, during times of crisis, turn to populist leaders as a means of finding meaning through the confusion. 
Build the runway (fork project) and the gods of good fortune will send down precious cargo (adoption, price increases) in airplanes from the blue beyond.
Note that the article mentions how confusion resulting from contact with more technologically advanced societies often sprouts Cargo Cults. Bitcoin is a massive innovation and technically overwhelming to many who see its benefits nonetheless. Accordingly, rbtc has much social, religious and conspiracy rhetoric but there is severe lack of technical competence to make rational sense of the demon technology (SegWit) they decry.
Needless to say, Cargo Cultism is a social display and it's effects are psychological (for participants) and no cargo is ever actually delivered.

Bear in mind that block size is not the only parameter that limits tx capacity. Network propagation, tx and block validation times, mempool capacity due to limitations of RAM, etc all play a part.
Most of these Big Block proponents show a considerable lack of comprehension regarding the protocol and its inner workings, design trade-offs and technological constraints.
I would go so far as saying that I believe there is lack of intelligence there, but then again, some of the smartest PhDs in the developer team admit to having only "fuzzy" understanding about certain aspects of the protocol.
I'm starting to believe this scaling issue is less about ideological differences than it is about the Big Block side manufacturing the problem to disguise their true motive and wrestle Bitcoin from the hands of the cypherpunks. Of course, they underestimated the power of conviction that is generated when a group has moral high ground. 
In the end the Big Block camp ("economic nodes") will relent and fork an altcoin and pass it off as "Bitcoin". They could and should have done this years ago.
I find the pervasive need to see more adoption interesting. I once believed that this was of primary importance too. To uplift the masses of disenfranchized, to loosen the grip that traditional finance capital holds on most people of the world. Humanism, in short.
Subsequently, I've had some interesting insights:
Most of the users in crypto-space believe increased adoption will increase price. So their motive is selfish, almost religious in its simplicity, but driven by a desire for future glory and wealth. Yet, if we examine the history of the price chart, there is no direct correlation between degree of adoption and price.
Bitcoin cannot be all things to all people. Many of the developing world locations where I have lived and worked have local economies that do not favor Bitcoin. In fact, forcing Bitcoin on the rural poor would be a burden on them. They receive their weekly wages in cash and spend in local markets where there is poor internet connectivity and unreliable electricity supply.
Among the many urban-dwelling Western millenials there is pervasive adoption. Yet, they do not use Bitcoin for its primary features of privacy and permissionless transactions. They run with open arms to various trusted middlemen, eagerly submit themselves to KYC and compromise their identity - and that of all users - to get hold of precious bitcoin. They want VISA issued Bitcoin debit cards, so they can spend bitcoin conveniently. They leave their bitcoin in exchange wallets and come asking in this subreddit: "what is a private key?"
So, there is some ignorance out there and some use cases do not fit a censorship-resistant Bitcoin. However, we must acknowledge that there is a growing market that wants to mix cryptocurrency with banking. Agree or not, market forces hold sway. However, it would not make sense to sacrifice Bitcoin's cypherpunk meaning for the sake of those who want to spend it permissively, in deference of those who want to use it as a store of value and anti-state tool.
Bitcoin is a victim of its own success. A hard fork and chain-split is inevitable.

Miners themselves run fullnodes.
Network security is greatly dependent on these mining fullnodes, but it would be false to say that the validation, by non-mining fullnodes, of the blocks produced by miners does not contribute to security.
Furthermore, beyond network security, users want to verify and validate their own transactions with a fullnode, so they do not have to entrust their security to a 3rd party.
You mention "dynamic blocksize" in your response. That is not a viable option, precisely because of the correlation of between blocksize and security. Hence, dynamic blocksize can be gamed by a cartel of miners (or a single malicious miner).


I think you did not read the article I linked. It demonstrates that every public network - no matter how large - is subject to the principle of induced demand. Why would Bitcoin be exempt? No-one can say for sure what latent demand exists for Bitcoin's blockspace. Is it 7bil people? Is it a few corporations with 10bil transactions per week, funded by users' fees? You haven't thought it through...


My entire response to you was the explanation of this relationship. Censorship-resistance requires the highest degree of network security possible. Network security is dependent on the highest degree of decentralization possible. To maximize decentralization (of nodes and miners), blocksize cannot be adjusted by much (up or down). Hence, the blocksize will remain near 1MB-2MB and that makes it scarce. 


Blockchain, because of its primary design feature of censorship-resistance, requires all blocks and transactions to be passed around between connected peers for validation and consensus-seeking. This makes blockchain slow - compared to a centralized payment network like VISA.
A Bitcoin tx requires 6 confirmations before it joins official history. With 10min blocktimes, that's at least an hour, but with the variance in blocktimes that may be 2-3 hours. That's slow and unreliable.
If a user wants to transact now - get their transaction in the next block - they must pay a miners' fee. It may be cheap or expensive, but even when paying an expensive fee, they have no guarantee that their transaction will be mined. That's unreliable.
If a transaction is mined, it may end up in a block that becomes orphaned when there is a chain re-org - such as happens a few times a week. They may then have to rebroadcast that transaction, or change its fee to have it mined. That's inconvenient and unreliable - compared to Visa or PayPal or cash over the counter.
Changing blocksize does not alter the unreliability of the protocol. The unreliability is not a bug, but a feature of consensus and censorship-resistance.
@_date: 2017-07-23 23:19:56
1) According to the protocol, every tx must be signed - whether it's a SegWit tx or not.
2) There is misinformation going around that alleges SegWit discards tx signing. This is false - see point 1, above.
3) SegWit changes the way in which transactions are recorded in blocks, by storing the signature (witness) data separately. This allows: 
- more transactions per block
- tx/witness look-up optimization
- storage reduction on non-archiving nodes
- elimination of (SegWit) tx malleability
 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:46:30
I used to be a believer in bigger blocks, and dynamic blocksize changes via algorithm. It was through following discussions between the Core devs that I learnt the significant link between blocksize and security.
Most core devs describe the post-SegWit blocksize increase as a "compromise". 
Now that Litecoin has SegWit, Bitcoin doesn't also need it. Keeping blocksize at 1MB seems the middle way.
IMO SegWit is a compromise, too, but one that I'm willing to concede in order to keep Bitcoin interesting for the core devs.

I agree with your description and thank you for clarifying. It is indeed misleading to speak of the core developers (and contributors) as a single entity with a leadership hierarchy and strict schedule. It's a "ragged army on the march" bound by open source ethics and consensus only.
My references to "Core" is to the developer/contributor consensus expressed at the Bitcoin Core website, specifically re hard fork delay on this page:
I know that some participants in the Bitcoin Core project prefer to be referred to as "core developers" while others want a more loose "I am a developer who contributes to Bitcoin Core". I'm not sure what the general, or most correct term is, but I think referring to just "Core" is mostly understood to be "the project called Bitcoin Core that communicates at 
Yes, most of those people who tar and feather Bitcoin Core, Blockstream, etc as malicious conspiracies use "Core" as a swear word without correct understanding of its loose affiliation and internal variance of opinions (as you correctly described it). But then again, those conspiracy theorists, are living in the dark ages - both psychologically and intellectually - and there is little benefit in trying to word everything one says so they don't misunderstand. I find that they choose to misunderstand anyway: the other day Andreas Antonopoulos spent time to explain SegWit to that subreddit and soon there were several people howling that he's a liar and takes Bitcoin users to be idiots because he said "SegWit introduces version numbers to Bitcoin!" ... well, listening to the interview, he actually says "SegWit introduces Script version numbers". 
I believe many developers are keen to see SegWit activated since this allows other innovations. As we know, Bitcoin will continue working just fine without SegWit, but bright minds need to remain interested, so I am keen to see SegWit activated just to keep the braintrust engaged.

If we take a step back, it can be argued that no-one is "strangling bitcoin". Miners have a profit incentive and this is baked into Bitcoin's design by the whitepaper. When the rally ends, the high fee party ends and then they will prefer to be seen to signal for SegWit.

Users were not consulted about SW2x. It is a corporate agreement and minor code by a small group of sub-par developers. They're simply implementing (and borking) a means for miners to activate Core's SegWit (already included in clients) before Aug 1.
The 2x part is a plan (agreed to by corporate interests and miners) to hard fork to 2MB blocks in Oct/Nov 2017. That is where we may finally part ways with these consensus breakers. Note that "they" are forking, so the exchanges will assign them an altcoin ticker symbol like "BT2x", or such

indeed. Every user's node on the P2P network is independent of the entities you mention. The user is free to modify the client as they wish.
The Open Source development model means that contribution to the project's code is based on merit.
Bitcoin development adds a consensus rule to that - that changes to the code base can only be made if there is near unanimous agreement (~95%). 
All source code is subject to peer review before inclusion, peer review by contributors and the general public. 
Subsequently, no company or entity can determine the content and direction of the code. They can suggest it, they can even lobby for it, but without 95% flat-out agreement their idea won't be included.

UASF supporters should beware they don't assume the same reactionary rhetoric and risk taking of the Big Blocks camp.
Seeing that the risks of UASF are not clearly understood, perhaps an explanation will help clarify. I don't comprehend all the risks (other than those outlined by the OP), but I can say this:
Miners and businessmen drink Bitcoin wine: they act on and lobby according to what will profit them. This will be the case for evermore.
From this step-back perspective it can also be observed that fee rates increase during speculative rallies - periods of increased participation, usage and public visibility. Similarly, fees decrease when the speculative fervor (and price) subsides.
Yes, its a time of high-octane emotion, but we should not conflate the very different issues: SegWit is a reasonable proposal for an already difficult-to-scale Bitcoin; Bitcoin will experience periods of peak and low usage regardless of SegWit; fees will fluctuate accordingly; and *miners will take advantage of increased demand for block space*. 
Remember: a mining boom surges network difficulty.
Once the speculative rally subsides usage will decrease. Extreme hashing difficulty and lower fees will render mining less profitable. **Miners will no longer have an incentive to block SegWit**.
Many Bitcoin supporters are annoyed at miners' decision to prolong their fee profits. Those that have unconfirmed transactions look for someone to blame. Others protest that the miners induce high fees and obstruct adoption. This is the very argument being promoted by the Big Blockers. 
Price is not determined by block size, fee rate, adoption or any fundamental factor. Like in *any market since the dawn of trade*, **price is driven by speculative cycles**.
All that is required is the long-view and patience. SegWit will inevitably be signaled by miners. There is no real, measurable Urgency. Even if there was, it is not an excuse to risk fundamental security, which is infinitely more important than price or some third party's Bitcoin business plan.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:34:26
transactions are created by wallet software, included in blocks by miners, and SegWit allows each txn's signature (witness) data to be stored outside the blockchain. This allows 1.7x to 2x more txns to be stored in 1MB blocks.
SegWit also incentivizes users to prefer "SegWit-style" txns which consume more UTXOs than they create. In the long-run this will reduce the rate at which the global UXTO set grows, thereby, resulting in a smaller blockchain than a non-SegWit protocol would yield over the same period.

The limitation on blocksize is not imposed by anyone, its a parameter imposed by the design decision to prioritize censorship-resistance. If you choose one feature then others are necessarily precluded. Like if you want a really energy efficient vehicle, you cannot also want it to be the most powerful in the industry. The two features are mutually exclusive.
No matter what I say to you, and I mean to bring you to my understanding, we won't agree. As i learnt from dealing with opposition politics during my country's liberation war: some factions are irreconcilable. Nothing wrong with that, as long as they both acknowledge it.
Big blocks as per the urgent demands of the current Big Adoption faction will never happen in the Bitcoin network. It might happen years or decades from now for reasons backed by scientific observation and actioned by the Core developers. They themselves admit to that.
But if the Big Blockers want a big adoption large transaction chain their only option is to fork. The cypherpunk manifesto is dedicated to the individual's right to privacy versus the state, not about giving as many people as possible cheap transactions. The two objectives are mutually exclusive, because as you move the blocksize slider from 1MB toward 1GB, something strange happens to Bitcoin security.

Re: backdoors: Bitcoin is developed according to an Open Source methodology, meaning all source code is available to the public, for scrutiny, and any changes to the code must first pass peer review before being included in the code base. According to millions of eyeballs there are no backdoors in the Bitcoin source code:
Regarding the security of Bitcoin private keys (from which public keys and eventually addresses are derived), you're in luck: this video by James D'Angelo explains it convincingly and in layman's terms:
If you're interested, the time it would take a hacker to crack a Bitcoin private key, with current resources (see the first answer by Chris Moore):
edit: private keys, public keys and addresses are not created on the blockchain but on personal devices using the publicly available secp256k1 Eliptic Curve library. Hence, a man-in-the-middle attack is ruled out (on personal devices) but a hacker could access unencrypted private keys if they gain access to a device.

The roadmap is generally understood to be as follows:
- a) miners must signal for SegWit (which allows many protocol improvements and some scaling)
- b) once 95% of miners signal consistently then SegWit activation begins countdown
- c) given continuing political deadlock, there is also (a less desirable) option whereby network users force SegWit activation (UASF) via their fullnodes (which outnumber miners).
At the moment, some of the most powerful miners are not signalling for SegWit, since (as one of their spokesmen explained) they want to profiteer from the current high fee rate and prolong this lucrative fee market.
Hence, it's a difficult time to do transactions. But market forces prevail. During a rally, there is much incentive and necessity for speculators and stakeholders to do transactions. Once the speculative wave subsides, so could transaction volume and fees per byte, perhaps forcing miners to concede to SegWit.
Miner signaling is the preferred mechanism - a user activated softfork is messy and sets an uncomfortable precedent. Yet, it remains a solution for deadlock and a rod of correction for a powerful but "uncooperative" mining faction.
BTW, Bitcoin has a life of its own. It is unlikely to die - even if the majority of users go elsewhere :)
For as long as it remains secure, censorship resistant, and the developers adhere to the vision of Bitcoin, I and many others will run fullnodes - no matter how high the fees or how negative the sentiment out there.
Long Live Bitcoin, Long Live!

Let's consider the terms "peer-to-peer" and "decentralized":
When Satoshi refers to "peer-to-peer cash" he's referring to Bitcoin's network architecture, which is based on a collection of equal nodes, modeled on the BitTorrent network. This is in contrast to "client-server" networks where there is hierarchy and specific points of failure, as you say. Bitcoin remains a peer-to-peer network.
Some argue, and I agree, that mining is very centralized right now. The number of full nodes will probably continue to increase and decrease with economic and fad cycles. But we should ensure that running a full node remains a reasonable option, because this ensures a diverse and decentralized network that can enforce protocol consensus rules.

For that matter, why not cut out all the effort of LN and just use VISA or PayPal?
I'm not sure if you're now just playing with me, but here's a brain-connect in case you truly don't understand the layered scaling proposition:
Bitcoin is a decentralized anti-state network. By "anti-state" I mean it defies the state's control and centralized permission system. Bitcoin could have gone nowhere but, instead, it was rapidly adopted around the world and now represents the world's largest super-computer. That is a forceful security advantage that other altcoins don't share: Bitcoin's network effect and robust security. These features are not an accident: it's the result of Satoshi's innovation and the work of the Bitcoin Core developers - a formidable brain trust that continues to improve and innovate Bitcoin.
The LN innovation is not stand-alone. It was designed to work with a settlement layer. It only works if a settlement layer is present. 
Now, the settlement layer could be VISA or it could be Ethereum or Litecoin...
But the preferred settlement layer is Bitcoin - robustly secure, censorship-resistant, anti-state, away from the bank, largest market adoption of all cryptocurrencies, proven developer team.
The settlement layer is not the middleman, it is the structural foundation. LN benefits by building its house on a rock; Bitcoin benefits from network load reduction; Bitcoin users benefit from lower fees - on LN and on-chain. The world benefits from a payment protocol that is better than VISA in every respect: politically sound, more secure, private, faster, and decentralized.
But the current batch of miners don't like that and they are, evidently, prepared to risk killing the goose that lays the golden eggs in the interest of short-term profits.
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:24:56
Those claims are opinion-based statements, its onerous to attempt to make technical arguments against them because they don't include technical facts as a starting point for discussion. Instead they are simply nebulous statements, probably based on misinformation.
For example:
The first claim is unclear. SegWit is a change of transaction architecture. Lightning is a protocol layer. LN does not need SW for implementation.
Does the claimant imply that the combination of SegWit + LN disincentivizes miners? If he does, then he must mean that somehow there is a negative impact on fees (from miners' perspective), and there is no technical argument against that.
A response to the claim might be: do we innovate to optimize and improve Bitcoin, or do we scrap protocol innovations if they don't optimize and improve income for miners?
Another response is that LN is a layer protocol that leverages settlement as a means of reducing fees for micro-transactions. LN can exist without SW, and other layer protocols already exist - and have for years. Exchanges typically implement client hot-wallets in a SQL layer which they periodically settle to the Bitcoin mainchain. Do self-evident solutions that lower fees for end-users annoy miners? Maybe they do, but there is no technical argument to be made. 
Claim 1 is a statement about economic dynamics that cannot be made illegal and have no technical dimension.

When you click the "Receive" tab in Electrum it will display different addresses randomly chosen from your wallet's address pool.
Remember that, since you did the transaction at an ATM, Electrum has no knowledge of that transaction until it propagates through the network and reaches the Electrum server you're connected to.
With the current state of the network that may take a while. Patience is the only option.
You can track that incoming transaction via the "History" tab. It may take several hours to show up, and may take several days to confirm depending on what fee the ATM wallet paid.

Good idea to look at counter-arguments. Regardless of one's view of the conservative think-tank Cato Institute and their always-contrarian stance, the author there raises a useful flag:


This moderates the view being offered in the linked article in Wired, that there is *direct 1:1 correlation*. This helps the discussion of capacity increases in Bitcoin, because calculations should include the idealized 1:1 growth in demand, as well as more conservative 1:0.3
The Cato Institute article uses a wide range of US city examples, yet, the capacity increases being considered only vary between 10% to 35%.
With Bitcoin, the next block size increase is a 100% increase to 2MB - a doubling of capacity with immediate effect. And we know there is massive latent demand for Bitcoin blockspace, so perhaps 30% demand growth, initially, but undoubtedly 100% demand growth eventually. i.e. All of the 2MB blockspace will eventually be consumed.
The corporate retail chain is looking at blocksize increases of 200% to 800% within the next 2 years.

Bitcin price typically either halves or doubles (at least) during any given year - sometimes both in the same year. So, a projected CPI ("inflation") figure of 4%/year is negligible compared to price swings of 50% or more over the same period. Additionally, the price swings are for all intents and purposes unpredictable, so the exercise is futile. 
Also, many commentators on economy argue that the modern age of inflation is over, and that from here on out we'll be coming to terms with global economic deflation. (Just a side note, but worth thinking about).

One can argue, that the only reason why the NYA happened was because of the threat of BIP148's UASF. That's when and where Barry Silbert commissioned his friend Jeff Garzik to code the action plan "segwit2x".
Jeff Garzik has been a proponent of Big Blocks for many years: [BIP102](
Significantly, many of the miners are signaling "NYA" which shows their allegiance. They may be bluffing, but this is what Garzik is referring to as hash rate majority. To me it seems that for Garzik, and his NYA employers, its not so much a question of whether their "2x" HF will succeed, but rather a case of garnering the mining support to split off their big block chain.

Bitcoin Core's *SegWit* code has been tested and is included in the Core client already - awaiting activation. "SegWit2x" is a constellation of things:
- the result of the closed door NYA (that excluded the core devs)
- code to activate existing *SegWit* code via BIP91
- risky shortening of times between lock-in, activation and a 2MB HF
- code fork of a new client called BTC1
- contentious hard fork to 2MB blocks in Oct/Nov
As for activating *SegWit*, that is being rushed by the "SegWit2x" project - because the NYA participants want to avoid a BIP148 on Aug 1. They will probably achieve this if miners lock-in *SegWit* before the end of this month.
As for the 2MB hard fork commissioned by the NYA and being coded by Jeff "Butter Fingers" Garzik and the comedy cast of BTC1, this part needs to be clearly understood by this community:
The NYA/BTC1 hard fork to 2MB blocks is the chain split.
**Corporate interests represented by the NYA are forking Bitcoin after  *SegWit* has been activated**. There is no other interpretation or outcome of this scheduled event.
They don't want the Core developers, they don't want layered scaling (even though the exchanges have been using layered settlement since inception), and they want to aggressively scale on-chain to chase up transactions, fee volume and their version of Bitcoin's suitability as a medium security retail network.
So, the OP is correct: it is in our interest to be calm. The NYA and BTC1 will fork and we'll be here: calm and with some measure of peace - to get on with the task of maintaining and improving Bitcoin, keeping consensus.

I'm saying its important to distinguish between "investment" in the Bitcoin economy and "monopoly" of Bitcoin mining hashpower.
I am not a proponent of changing PoW willy-nilly. However, it is a usable option in extreme circumstances. It's "benefit" is that it sets back the largest miner the most, while many small miners can quickly and easily make the change. Remember, Bitcoin mining is stronger with many diverse, small miners than it is with a few large miners.
My view is based on the fact that Bitcoin was created by cypherpunks - advocates of the right to privacy - as a censorship-resistant network. Big business and large investment is nice but it is not more important than censorship-resistance. By this logic, Bitcoin does not need corporative involvement for Bitcoin to do what it was designed for.

This is guaranteed by design and consensus rule, not market cap or the sheer will of stakeholders!
In future, next to a corporate Bitcoin and centralized control/budget, legacy Bitcoin will become almost insignificant. Not because it fundamentally has no value, but because the majority of market participants won't see its purpose in a central bank fiat-cryptocurrency world. We disagree, I am sure, and this is fine but each side must play by its conviction. In the 1980s a lot of my people asked me why I was putting my energy into opposing the Apartheid government - they could never be beaten with their dominance and international support from Britain and the US. But we brought the Apartheid government right down to its knees.
Sticking by principles has rewards. Wanting dominance - economic power over all - is no different from religious emperialism/fundamentalism. Cypherpunks don't care if Bitcoin is big or small, as long as it allows private, permissionless transactions on a censorship-resistant blockchain, we are satisfied.

You speak with confidence and incredulity.
I think we agree that there is an underlying mathematical coherence to the Universe and all manifestation. Science continually discovers the mathematical basis of nature. 
For example, the Fibonacci ratios of .382 and .618 dominate cycles of growth (and decay) in plants, spiral galaxies, human physical proportions, atomic structure, etc. 
Human psychology, also favors the .618 ratio as we witness in art ("golden ratio"), architecture, and group behavior.
The market being a dispersed collective, all acting in concert, it follows that the market collective develops a psychology. Starting in the 1940s, technical analyst, Ralph Elliott began finding endless occurences of key Fibonacci ratios in market charts. To the extent that it has been formalized as a principle of market behavior.
The market's tendency, over time, to revert to a mean is another observed principle. And the mathematical sub-structure informing collective decision in the market is apparent from the derivative formulae that plot many popular indicators.
It sounds like weird science, on the surface, but human psychology and group psychology, imposes subconscious limits on price movement - these limits are defined by the same Fibonacci mathematics that manifest in everything around us.
Its nonsensical to most, fascinating to many, and profitable for some.

You seem to be in a maze of conceptual confusion.
I like Privacy. I have done and will always fight for my right to privacy. When I fight for others' right to privacy then I gain privacy too.
But this is also true: I fight against the right to privacy of those in public positions. In his personal life a politician has the same right to privacy as everyone else, but in his public role he has no right to privacy - everything he does must be transparent to the public. 
So I like privacy, but it depends on the context.
Bitcoin allows anyone to make private transactions, away from surveillance of the state. But that privacy is not automatic - just because you're using Bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions, by default, are public - recorded in a timestamped public ledger and your location and ISP records allow easy association between you and a transaction. But if you know how, the cypherpunk way, then it allows you to move any value to anywhere in the world anonymously. And whoever you moved it to will always retain that value as long as Bitcoin remains censorship resistant.
If someone doesn't know how to conceal their digital identity, then they can neither obtain nor spend bitcoin anonymously (privately). So, just by using Bitcoin, no-one gains privacy. The censorship-resistance has no meaning or relevance to them. Most people run to an exchange and submit their identity to KYC when they purchase bitcoin. Their name, location and Bitcoin addresses enter a global surveillance database. They couldn't be anonymous after that. They willingly sacrifice their own privacy.
The proposition of the Big-Block-Big-Adoption camp (mostly comprised of Bitcoin businesses and miners) is that the censorship-resistance (security) be degraded in favor of more adoption and more transactions. They don't make this critical sacrifice to bring the gift of privacy to the global population. They make this sacrifice because they don't care for Bitcoin's security, don't need censorship resistance - because they themselves are bank satellites and apply KYC to their Bitcoin customers already.
They make the sacrifice because censorship-resistance and privacy is not good for bank business. They want all that adoption and transaction to make them profit, not because they want to fight for the individual's right to privacy, or because they want to degrade the power of the state or the bank. Without the bank they will have no business, because they sell their BTC income straight to fiat all day long.
So, if it were up to me to promote the right to privacy of all people, then i would do so by bolstering the tool handed to us by the cypherpunks - by fighting for Bitcoin to be as secure as possible, and for its degree of decentralization to be as high as possible. This is exactly what the Core developers do day after day, as a group operating by consensus rule - no matter who pays them. No developer can slip anything into the code base because every line of code is subject to peer review, around the clock.

Thanks for sharing your story and experience.
As you say, trading and gambling require similar methodologies and strategic approaches. Specifically, they involve making bets on probable outcomes. Market speculation is essentially a bet on price direction and distance, whether you're longing or shorting the market, buying or selling.
One of the base calculations for games of chance (and, hence, speculation) involves determining what portion of your gambling purse (trading/investment funds) to commit to each round of betting. There is no case, ever, where one bets 100% of your funds on a direction or outcome. That is the first thing to comprehend since it allows one to react to the waves of good and bad fortune ("luck") in the game/market. Maximizes longevity and possibility for adjustment or recovery.
Bets on probable outcomes all have mathematical formulae in common, whether poker, roulette or price movement. Knowing the weight of probability at certain chart junctions is aided by technical analysis. So, in a sense it is possible to determine price direction - not *absolutely* but *probabilistically*. Adjusting (increasing and decreasing) the size of your bet according to the probability revealed by technical analysis - especially when multiple technical indications stack up over days and weeks - is the key. Its a slow game of applying a methodology with discipline and patience.

Maybe abandoning the whole project would be too extreme. Bitcoin does admittedly not scale well, but this is a design feature and what gives Bitcoin the flagship status of most secure and most robust of the cryptocurrencies. Of course, these features come at the cost of flexibility and scalability.

The trick is not to think of trading as gambling.
In the casino, say with roulette, they announce: "All bets are off". The market has no such announcement, so we don't have to anticipate what it will do.
Instead, we wait for the market to show its direction, to confirm its direction with technical indications, and then we take position.

I should have stated that my criticism addresses your argument - not your article writing, which is readable and well presented.
We can think of it this way: there will always be people who want a robust, secure and censorship-resistant Bitcoin. The developer team that gives us that is Bitcoin Core. Any other fork of Bitcoin, with less capable developers and less security is not for those who value censorship-resistance. So, it's not a case of "replacing" Bitcoin but taking market share. In a way it's a good thing: all those who want bigger blocks and have a different vision for Bitcoin, can fork their altcoin chains, take their slice of the market pie and go forth and prosper - leaving Bitcoin Core and its supporters in peace to use, improve and mine the original real-deal Bitcoin.

We're not speaking from the same definitions of the concepts.


We could but what would the effect be on the cost of running a node, for users and miners? When the bottom 5% get priced out the network loses diversity and this represents a degradation of decentralization, and therefore security.


There are 3 core developers funded by Blockstream. 3 out of more than 100 active core contributors. So if only 3% are opposing bigger blocks and 97% support the idea then there is consensus according to Satoshi's rule for Bitcoin. But the majority of those 100 developers oppose a schedule of increasing block sizes. Most are okay with 2MB I believe.
Its not a Blockstream manuevre, its science. Blocksize is the wrong parameter to manipulate if we're interested in scaling Bitcoin, because of the economic principle of Induced demand:
That is the principle that informs opposition to blocksize increase. The core developers discussed and reached agreement on this matter perhaps 3 or 4 years ago if I remember correctly.
Anyone who argues for increased blocksize must first acknowledge the phenomenon of Induced Demand and then present a convincing scientific argument why it won't apply to Bitcoin's public network.
I'm arguing that this will never be forthcoming from the Big-Block-Big-Adoption camp. The spokespeople for this enterprise/adoption market are probably fully aware of the impact of Induced Demand but they never mention it and negate questions about it. But, they know that bigger blocks - good for business - will soon generate more congestion and more fees - good for ever more centralized mining partners.


Well, Kalashnikov created an automatic rifle with specific design features - specifically that it should be robust. Certain other features are sacrificed by the primary design decision.
While the rifle can be used as flower holder, or be used by policemen in patrol vehicles, these are not uses it was designed for. There are better flower pots and hand guns are better suited to getting in and out of a vehicle and close-quarter confrontation.
Satoshi was a cypherpunk. He designed Bitcoin from cypherpunk motivations, specifically to further the individual's right to privacy and to frustrate the central authority of cenbanks over currency. 
Probably most businesses and banks wish this wasn't true because then Bitcoin would be so much more useful to them - if it didn't allow users to avoid KYC and surveillance. If they can centralize it, they can remove this annoying feature. But those who are in the censorship-resistance market will never allow that - not the users, not the core devs, and not the cypherpunks.
The Big-Block-Big-Adoption market can only ever have the chain they envision  by creating a new altcoin, or by forking Bitcoin Enterprise. They have planned and are busy executing the latter option.

So, a BIP can propose a change to the GUI or a change to some minor code that optimizes log output.
The BIPs I list above are proposals that define soft fork conditions and their outcomes. "segwit2x" is using BIP91 to activate *SegWit* code (BIP141). Some users want to activate *SegWit* by holding a gun to miners' heads (BIP148) on Aug 1st. That's their choice - no-one can stop them. The corporate community that use Bitcoin to line their pockets chose BIP91 to activate SegWit and their game plan is called "segwit2x". They want to activate *SegWit* with BIP91 and then perform a hardfork to increase blocksize to 2MB a few months later. Most of the community wants *SegWit* but don't want 2MB blocks so soon.
So, BIP91 will enact a "lock-in" and then activation of *SegWit* code (that exists in the Core client already.) If it does so before Aug 1, the BIP148 is castrated and has no effect. 
There is no BIP for the hard fork, that is just a thing they want to do. 
A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) is a formal proposal for a change. It might involve actual code or just a change in conceptual direction. Several conflicting BIPs can co-exist at the same time, its up to the userbase or miners to choose which one they support. If there are technical stipulations they are outlined in each BIP. Hence, the only way to know a BIP fully is to read it yourself. If you ask someone here they might just say: "oh that BIP is unimportant".
Bitcoin is highly technical, and requires technical vigilance for those users who care. The rest are just dragging along on hearsay and second-hand information - and are therefore unimportant to the protocol's development. If you care about BIPs you have to read them.

Intuitively, it would seem that larger blocks dilute transaction volume, removing the congestion and thereby reduces fees.
However, in reality the effect of increasing capacity of large public networks actually has a counter-intuitive outcome: the new supply is rapidly filled by latent demand and the congestion returns.
Hence, if miners and Bitcoin businesses are aware of this phenomenon ( [Induced Demand]( ) then it makes sense that they will want bigger blocks. Larger blocks allows more transactions and with time these blocks become congested, so you have a) more transactions with b) high tx fees.
This condition would, of course, justify the next profitable blocksize increase - every time time further degrading decentralization (security).

You are correct to say that central banks will soon be issuing digital currency, e.g. Fedcoin, and using centralized blockchain to rejuvenate and exaccerbate the fiat money system. And it will allow them to control money and people more efficiently. Indeed. Andreas Antonopoulos describes this looming event very well.
However, a centralized blockchain is not the same thing as Bitcoin's decentralized original. 
A centralized blockchain is prone to inumerable and unanticipated attack vectors. By copy-cat implementation the fake blockchains are fundamentally vulnerable and will end in tears for their owners.

That sounds overly complicated. The Bitcoin development process works fine.


But why 2MB? Why increase blocksize at all? To what purpose?


Its not so much that lack of research makes something a good idea, its also about making changes to a live multi-billion dollar network whose primary function is to secure Other People's Money.
Even so, blocksize increase, as a means of scaling is a provably bad idea: 


Developers have specific interests and coding styles that are obvious to other coders. Instead of having a name and a face, developers will be referred to by their handle, gravitar pic or coding style/topic.
Again, the open source dev process works fine. The problems emanate from a corporate cartel that seeks to co-opt Bitcoin. Changing the dev process to anonymity won't change the fact that finance capital (miners and bitcoin businesses in bed with the banks) would rather see a centralized Bitcoin than the scarce blockspace, censorship resistant Bitcoin we have.

Various companies and research organisations salary different Core developers and this is not unethical and is inevitable - no one can outlaw this practice. What you are pointing at is that perhaps there is a conflict of interest in the case of Blockstream.
The reason why most people are okay with the practice of funded developers is because this is common practice in the Open Source field. Satoshi, while he was still working on the project, on-boarded Gavin Andresen while he was being paid a salary by some company or the other. One important feature of Bitcoin's development process is that Satoshi imposed the Rule of Consensus which dictates that changes to the software can only be made if there is near-unanimous agreement (~95%) else no change may be made.
This consensus rule mitigates the influence of one single developer, or group of developers in the Bitcoin Core project. With over 100 contributors, it is easy to see that Blockstream employment of 4 or 5 or even 10 of them does not allow its interests to force consensus on any potential change.

The block reward (paid to miners when they find a block) halves every 4 years. So, as per Satoshi's Bitcoin whitepaper, fees will eventually sustain miners. Miners have expensive bills to pay, right?
Since block space is limited, users are willing to pay more and more to increase the chance that their transaction will be included in the next block. Miners choose which transactions they include in the block they're mining, so higher fees increase a transaction's chance of being mined. Hence, users chase up the fees during periods when the network is busy (heavy usage and lots of transactions).
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:40:23


True, yet the protocol and economy has developed around those parameters, so they have become constants. In the same way as supply/demand on monetary base is mean avg calibrated to an arbitrary money supply of 21mil coins.
It is conceivable that if blocksize had been arbitrarily set to 10MB early on we'd have the same dynamics and fee rates as we have now because of the phenomenon of [Induced Demand](


The point is that, a slow+unreliable+expensive blockchain, is the current inherent (fundamental) condition. I am not referring to an unknown or imaginary condition in future, but to what is the reality now. Remember, changes and innovations can be proposed but they must be lab simulated and tested before being deployed into the live blockchain and risking Other People's Money.

Your assessment is fair. The view that the network will mainly be used by casual citizen users and Bitcoin businesses does not take into account the multitude of entities out there that stand to benefit from the legitimacy and guarantees offered by Bitcoin's blockchain: Govts,  corporations, institutions, etc as you mention.
So, we come back to the scaling dilemma and the law of induced demand: the larger the capacity, the more heavily the network will be used. 
Despite the assumption made by some populists out there, blocksize and fee rates are not linearly correlated. Research in other, older large scale networks proves this.
If there were sufficient space, govts, for example, could commit public journaling and timestamps to the blockchain - effectively outsourcing this requirement by paying arranged fees to the largest miners in daily or weekly settlements. 
Therefore, even with larger chain capacity, by the time multiple large entities engage in this use case, we are back at full blocks, high fees, a settlement function, etc but at the cost of security.
During these early phases of Bitcoin we want to only see the smiling happy multitudes jubilating a Peoples' Bank and Money. Most fail to notice that beyond the circle of firelight, the banks and finance capital are circling like hyenas - drooling to consume it because it represents power and *money* to them. If they cannot own it they must kill it. History shows that this has always been their way.
Whichever way we slice and dice it, we arrive - in the end - at the outcome of Bitcoin being primarily a settlement layer. You and I may still choose to make direct, on-chain txns if the fees (at the time) justify the amount.
Over the long-term, many economic and use-case scenarios could unfold, but we only know that global economic and financial conditions will change. The present global credit inflation bubble cannot persist indefinitely. 
Its deflation will alter spending - also on the Bitcoin network - where behavior will by necessity become more measured and frugal; decisions based on conservation and how cost effective and productive a particular transaction is.

That's the misconception right there: "supply and demand set price". Decades of research and market charts dating back to Mesopotamia show that supply and demand is an economic vector while speculation is a market vector. The two vectors are different and act in different ways.
The myth-dream of the Big Adoption camp is that more adoption equals higher price - based on a misunderstanding of what drives the price chart. Yes, it is supply and demand over the long haul (decades), but in the short-term (months and years) it is sheer opportunistic speculation.
I've proposed since the early days of the Big Block camp's formation that the urge to increase block size is a misplaced desire to increase price - but based on complete misunderstanding of how markets work and, sadly, of what is good for Bitcoin.
What do Bitcoin users really want? Higher prices or a more secure, meaningful protocol?
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:20:31
Well, no.  Bitcoin does not exist to appease its corporate users. Miners are desperate whores for profit and have shown that they care little for principle or agreement (HK 2016).
The NYA agreement is between ~80 Bitcoin companies (including miners) and we users don't care about them! Who is a Bitcoin business in this ecosystem? Users will stick with Satoshi and the cypherpunks and censorship-resistance. Users won't compromise because its good for miners or some profit-making finance capital entity! Why do that? Are we changing the world for ourselves or are we handing the existing system Bitcoin?

Hold on, Bitcoin Core are not miners, and most core devs have a healthy caution for miners.
Yes, we cannot help that most miners have fallen into the hole of dependency on profit to survive. They're now slaves to the banks too.
This will not always be the case, but it is the case with the currents batch of miners. They must fail or go to some other chains, and new miners will replace them.

It has been at times in the past, and that leads to fewer active miners and therefore a greater risk of centralization, as discussed above.
In future, when there is no more block reward paid out by the protocol, mining profit will be entirely dependent on fees.
To maximize the number of miners, mining should be profitable. A healthy Bitcoin needs a healthy mining industry.
Consider that its not a static economy - it has fat and lean times and various cycles have an influence.

Satoshi Nakamoto seems to have overlooked this potentiality but, of course, it has been a topic of ongoing discussion since the rise of ASICs and the trend toward centralized mining.
However, the protocol is working as expected throughout and none of the current ruptions in the ecosystem are directly caused by the existence of an ASIC monopoly. This fact is an economic outcome that cannot be "coded away".
What we *do* see is that there is a misalignment between users and Bitcoin businesses (including miners). The two groups represent two different and incompatible markets in terms of the protocol characteristics they want to see: Businesses want to see more transactions, miners want to see more fees. The majority of users, including Bitcoin Core, want to see more store-of-value security. The chosen scaling solution, additional protocol layers (rather than blocksize increases), has thrown the current batch of economic stakeholders' business plans out of whack.
That is always the risk of investing heavily in a beta software.
edit: we can have sympathy for them, yes, but we cannot develop Bitcoin after the needs of businesses or according to profit motive of miners. Bitcoin's innovation is not that it creates a new playing field for finance capital, but that it is a censorship-resistant payment network that allows trustless transactions that require no third party's permission

The maxim of bitcoin ownership is:


In more words that means that the person or entity that has the private key of the address that contains the bitcoin is the owner of those bitcoin and only they can spend it.
So, in your case blockchain.io controls the private key of your bitcoin stored in a wallet on their server. If they get hacked or an employee goes rogue, your bitcoin can disappear.
In the case of a chain-split your BTC will also exist (in duplicate) on the other chain, and can be spent on the other chain - but *only* if you have the private key.

Well, as per the dictate left us by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is governed by consensus rule. This means that changes to the code can only be made if there is near-unanimous (~95%) agreement - else no changes are made.
Since there was contention (debate) about how Bitcoin should be scaled, for several years, no changes could be made. Several developers had proposed scaling solutions and about 2 years ago, a layered scaling solution was agreed to. Its busy rolling out.
Even at the height of the recent conflict, price was advancing $100 per day on many occasions, so that is why I argue that fundamental code and protocol conditions have nothing to do with price. Price is driven by speculation and speculation is fueled by social mood.

With consensus rule you can believe as hard as you want - that does not make it true. The 2x ("2M") part of "segwit2x" is contentious and is not a prerequisite for Bitcoin to be Bitcoin.
What they're saying is they want to give the impression that they intend to stick to the NYA.

Negation does not make debate.
We differ on the subjective quality of goals and motives of the companies.
There is a market for a Bitcoin with less transaction space because blockspace as a scarce resource enforces security (by a long causal line that only censorship-resistance supporters perceive).
There is a market for a Bitcoin that has the characteristics promoted by Ver, Wright and the NYA participants: blocks larger than 1 or 2MB and a fair degree of centralization, yet with massive adoption and a flood of on-chain transactions per second. If it generates more profit and Satoshi said let there be only a "few server farms" why not?
My point is, the market that seeks to break consensus, to take this creation from the realm of cypherpunk anti-state to bank satellite pro-state should fork, and fork asap.

In practice, rather than purchasing the physical hash power needed to outrun the network, it is probably cheaper, faster and easier to simply bribe or coerce a majority of miners. 
We've witnessed an attempted take-over of the network by the Big-Block-Big-Adoption camp during the course of the past few years. Their tactics were a combination of 
- buying/manufacturing the physical hash power
- lobbying mining pool operators as bannermen
- smear and misinformation campaigns
- fee market manipulation via sustained spam attacks
- discourage and disrupt developer progress
But it didn't work. Despite a multi-lateral attack lasting years, concerted economic interests failed to defeat the developer's consensus mechanism, failed to divert ordinary market forces, and failed to win public support for their plan to scale on-chain rather than via protocol layers.
Granted, SegWit and layered scaling has ruined many a parasitic Bitcoin business plan. Yet, unfortunately that was always the risk of investing heavily in a beta software.
Taking over the network, even for a few minutes is difficult. Even if successful for a few hours, the attacker risks his hard work being undone by the rest of the network.

Blockstream declined an invitation to attend. One explanation could be that they want to remain impartial and that they are satisfied with the existing roadmap for SegWit activation.
Barry Silbert's "compromise" among business entities is flawed because it (the compromise) revises SegWit technical requirements, allows continued use of ASICboost, and its timeframes are unrealistic according to many experts.
Some point out that it is banking and big business that got us to the current juncture of precarious global finance. Why should big business (even if they make their profits from Bitcoin) make scaling decisions - according to their agenda and banking partnerships - for Bitcoin?

I'm sure someone might comment with a suggestion of a specific topic that is widely perceived to require further research. From my perspective Bitcoin and its bockchain is interesting because of its censorship resistance. To be as censorship resistant as possible, its security and degree of decentralization should be high.
The ongoing scaling debate is polarized into two conceptual camps: those who perceive a solution in increased blocksize ("on-chain" scaling) and those who perceive better security in "layered" scaling. You're probably aware of the issue already.
Research of this topic, the scaling options that impact Bitcoin security, now and in the coming decades could be applicable across cryptocurrencies, and also for private blockchains. An already widely acknowledged phenomenon, [Induced Demand]( is relevant to public network scaling. That's something you might want to consider as a starting point if this topic interests you.

Consensus among miners is one manifestation. Consensus among fullnodes about the validity of an already mined block is another. Developers decide about whether or not to merge a piece of code according to their consensus on the matter. Satoshi has made several statements regarding consensus (near unanimous agreement) to the developers. Not that Satoshi is God, but I think there is consensus that developing Bitcoin by consensus is a good idea?

Sure you can. Not sure where the blocks are stored in Windows OS but in Linux its in ~/.bitcoin/
You should regularly backup the file wallet.dat in that folder to safeguard your wallet. You can encrypt it with a password via the Bitcoin GUI client. Be sure to use a password manager so you can use a strong password.
This might help: 
There are also torrents of the blockchain available online, but ideally you want your node to validate the blockchain from beginning to end, so you know you are using the true version.

So it will all happen in the next few months. Before the end of the year we will have two bitcoins - a fast one and a slow one; a bank one and a no bank one. Its been a big war for 3 years. Now its happening.
Anyway, Bitcoin cannot have instant transactions because the blockchain is so slow. One side wants to decrease security to make it faster and the original developers wants to keep it slow but add a layer to allow fast, instant transactions.

Acknowledged. Yet, remember that the Venezuelan example is complex and the mainstream media (including Roger Ver's bitcoin.com) does not tell you the whole story.
In Venezuela, Bitcoin is being used by a counter-revolutionary class to survive during economic and political collapse induced by the very same class's leadership.
If you saw pictures of the family being discussed in that article they would probably be living in a middle-class suburb of Caracas where they can still afford mobile connectivity and to drive down to the shops to stand in queues for food. That is fair and well, and Bitcoin makes it possible. They cannot be despised for their class or their ability to survive.
However, for the majority (80%) of the country's citizens, Bitcoin is not an option because they are surviving off rainwater and food from rural friends and relations. They have been in similar condition for decades under the US puppet governments that have exploited that country and its resources, and who are now punishing  it for trying to pursue more just and equitable self-governance.

The old guard of traditional investment will find it hard to get Bitcoin's value proposition. Not because they are "old" but because their thinking is entrenched in the paradigm of stocks and bonds and the correlations that had developed during the post-WWII bull market that is now busy topping out.
These same investing heavy weights, such as Warren Buffett and Howard Marks, admit that they've always stayed away from the volatile speculation of commodity markets, with the exception of precious metals. Bitcoin trades as a commodity and its closest analog in the traditional markets is gold, but bitcoin price has outrun gold many times over and rapidly.
So, Marks wonders how can bitcoin be an investment grade asset, or "medium of exchange" or a "store of value"? The answers could only be the same as they are for gold. But unlike unwieldy gold and its laborious trade process, bitcoin can be bought and sold within minutes. Hence its volatility is somewhat negated. 
That bitcoin is a store of value requires that one grasps the security proposition of ECDSA; the censorship-resistance of a P2P network; and a lot of inter-connected concepts that years in the stock market and old boys clubs just cannot prepare one for.
I imagine the above to be true in many cases.

That is not what the Big Adoption leadership is saying. Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and co are saying that a block size increase will reduce congestion and lower fees, so more people can afford to transact on-chain, hence, driving adoption. 
Of course, Jihan Wu and all miners stand to gain from the effects of induced demand: larger blocks &gt; more transactions &gt; more fee income &gt; same congestion... So, there is profit incentive to draw advantage from the phenomenon of induced demand but they don't ever admit this outright. 
Instead the proponents of block-size increases say: we must urgently do this to reduce congestion and lower fees for the people of the world. That is insincere, and they will make this argument before every block size increase for BitcoinNYA. Eventually, consensus enforcing full nodes will be centralized to a very few miners. That's not cypherpunk Bitcoin, that's VISA and PayPal.
Given that the censorship-resistant camp give research-based reasons why it doesn't want to encourage centralization, it is also insincere of the Big Block leadership to accuse them of betraying Satoshi's vision and trying to destroy Bitcoin. The accusation is being leveled by people who are evidently relying on Induced Demand to increase their mining profits, but they hide their intentions from their followers by a) saying: increase blocksize, it will lower congestion and fees; and by b) slandering those who can see what they're up and oppose it on ethical and security grounds.

I believe its fair to say that doubling blocksize will increase the cost of running a node. 
Hence increasing blocksize 4x will increase the cost of running a node further.
Everytime the cost of running a node increases, some miners will be priced out of the industry, hence the diversity and decentralization of the network is degraded and security decreases.
Do we agree on this relationship between blocksize and cost and degree of decentralization?


1MB is an arbitrary number, agreed. The mining industry, economy and ecosystem has developed around it and now it has become a constant, relative to which node running costs, transactions per block, security, etc revolves.
You speak of node count. Of course its good that more people are able to verify the chain and their own transactions but this does not determine network security. Mining nodes do. They should be as diverse and decentralized as possible.
As the cost of running a node increases, so mining becomes less affordable for small miners, and as blocksize increases further a centralizing force concentrates mining into fewer and fewer hands.
A useful measure is to ask how affordable running a node is for the lower 5% of the ecosystem.
While having a high node count indicates network and economic health, full nodes do not have the pivotal security role that mining nodes have.

Andreas makes a several good points. 
The primary truth is that "most of the concern about Chinese miners is racist". Of course it is. Popular opinions are often shaped by nationalist discourses and the West has everything to fear about China. More and more I notice westerners expressing vitriol against China, Chinese people and Chinese encroachment on Western interests. The worst-case scenario, and ultimate evil, that westerners readily point at is North Korea. A few decades ago it was "the Gooks", "Gobbledy-Gook" and Vietnam. So where does this automatic anger emanate from? No North Korean has harmed any westerner or western interests in recent memory. The attitude comes from western media and western governments.
Bitcoin does not belong to the West, nor does it belong to the East. It belongs to everybody and no-one. China happens to have the component manufacturing facilities to boost their lead in mining. That is an accident of history, and one that Chinese people and businesses cannot be blamed for taking advantage of.
As Andreas point out, the landscape will shift - because it always does - and Chinese miners will lose their competitive edge. 
No-one knows what the future economy looks like, we only know that it won't look like today - because everything changes. Sure, Jihan Wu's potty mouth and hostile self-interest doesn't help the already biased perception of Chinese people, but demonizing all Chinese people and motivations is a mistake. Perhaps we are better off, for now, with Chinese miners than we would have been had the 3-letter agencies had the foresight to join the mining race.
One outcome that Andreas did not speak of when he delivered this talk in 2016, was that a corporate cartel (including some China-based miners) would choose to fork in 2017. Already the landscape is shifting.

Bitcoin is an amalgamation of information age technological innovations. It incorporates some pre-existing technologies, like encryption, and the notion of a "scarce resource". The bitcoin value tokens, are subject to society's economic and speculative whims and use cases. The protocol and its code enforces the security and consensus rules that makes Bitcoin valuable. The developers must maintain the protocol code to enforce consensus and security. Whatever society does with the tokens us in the realm of economics. The developers shouldn't code in response to external economy, like the central banks do. The developers must stick to their task: computer science.
Some people allege a conflict of interest in the fact that some developers are both employees of Blockstream, as well as contributors to the Bitcoin Core project. Many conspiracy theories spring from this alleged "wrong". However, it is important to know that the Core project's open source development model, and consensus-based decision making process makes it impossible for any one developer, or group of developers, to exert unilateral influence on the code base. 
Satoshi's "golden rule of consensus" states that **changes to the code can only be made if there is almost unanimous (~95%) agreement - else no change should be made**. 
With over 100 contributors to the Bitcoin Core project, and open source code that is subject to public review, it should be apparent that contribution to the project is subject to merit and the group's effort is governed by consensus - including daily input from the broad community. Several Core developers are also employees of other research organizations. The majority of contributors are volunteers.


This accusation comes from a certain camp that feels it's interpretation of Satoshi's words is the correct one. I wrote about that a few comments lower in this thread.


The same camp referred to above also makes this misrepresentation. To deconstruct the statement requires a knowledge of the history of Bitcoin, knowledge of the camps that have developed and their different visions for Bitcoin. 
At critical matter that distinguishes the camps is *block size*. 
The Core developers, on the one hand, reference existing research data regarding the scaling of public networks - [Induced Demand]( - as substantiation for their view that a schedule ladder of block size increases is not a scaling solution. In fact, they argue, it would systematically compromise Bitcoin's security. Their consensus proposal is to scale Bitcoin via layers, according to [this logic](
The Big Block camp, on the other hand, argue that the only way to relieve congestion and high fees is to increase block size. If you have read the two articles linked in the previous paragraph you'll see why this is unscientific. This camp's proponents offer no reason why Induced Demand does not apply to Bitcoin's public network ; they avoid the Induced Demand phenomenon completely; and, in fact, offer no scientific argument for their view. Instead, they argue, Satoshi said that bigger blocks over time would be OK. 
Hence, it should now become evident why the round-about argument is offered that Bitcoin Core is deviating from Satoshi's "vision". No science, just "vision" as a justification for security compromise.
Bitcoin is already a settlement layer. The exchanges represent a layer where bitcoins are deposited - enter a SQL protocol database - where they are traded and then return to the main chain once withdrawn. The exchanges, in order to improve efficiency and lower fee costs, do not action every user's withdrawal individually. Instead, user withdrawals are settled to the mainchain in batches throughout the day. Anyone can look at their latest exchange withdrawal in a block explorer and see the settlement from a database layer in action.
Bitcoin Core are working within the constraints of Bitcoin's design features. I can offer this 5min read of [why Bitcoin's specific set of design features means it is difficult to scale](
So why does the Big Block camp ignore scientific debate and prefer emotive rhetoric and a "vision quest" instead? It's difficult to say for sure. Some argue that its just past slights and scraps that has now become political wrangling on the Bitcoin stage. Perhaps. Others wonder if the massive induced congestion that will result from a block size hiking program perhaps stands to benefit the most aggressive of the Big Blockers, namely, the largest mining manufacturers.
Whatever one may think, about who is right and who is wrong and what Satoshi's "true" vision was. Computer Science should rationally inform the development of a technical innovation that represents a fundamental threat to latter-day finance capital.


That is just plain impossible. The lie is being told in an effort to paint SegWit as somehow dangerous by oversight, an engineering blunder, an attack waiting to happen. I understand your concern, but rest assured the statement is false and the attack vector does not exist.

Its all about consensus - if your node agrees with 95% of nodes on the netowrk then that is the reality that is enforced. So, choosing what changes to make to a full nodes is a personal choice - to some extent - but pointless if you don't take all the other nodes into consideration.
There is only one SW implementation. It is already present in the Core client awaiting activation. The "segwit2x" name you see around is a rushed implementation because businesses and mners are scared of the Aug 1st UASF (BIP148). Miners are presumably now signaling "segwit2x" becuase they want to tip their at to the bi businesses that formulated this rushed deployment of SegWit. Its a means of political posturing and positioning, so the big Bitcoin businesses will view these miners favorably. I am sorry for puttin it this way, but miners are like downtown crack-whores -they have to go where the money and the pimps are because tomorrow might be their last day on the strip. Mining is highly, highly competitive and a miner has little honor and much greed for profit.
Hard fork / soft fork is about a fork in either case. A soft fork introduces new rules and a hard fork introduces rules that are not backward compatible. Hence, a general dislike for hard forks, but we are facing several hard forks in the coming months by several political groups.

Some users are suggesting a promotional "pool fund" that users can contribute bitcoin to, which will then pay for ads. That can be done, but the question becomes: what will those users gain from advertising Bitcoin? What do they get in return for the bitcoin they spend on advertising Bitcoin?
I suspect many people might answer: "more adoption and that will drive up the price, of course" but that causal relationship is just based on misunderstanding of how markets work.

By default *bitcoind* won't make more than 8 outbound connections, according to Pieter Wuille's explanation here:
```maxconnections``` applies to inbound peer connections and should increase your node's connection count. 
Either you have a typo in your *bitcoin.conf* file or there is a firewall/routing issue that prevents inbound peers from connecting.

Your allegation is wild, unfounded but understandable in context.
China has more mining companies than any other nation for a few simple, but complimentary reasons:
- massive, cheap electronics manufacturing industry
- cheap government subsidized electricity - even before Bitcoin existed
- having the largest population of any country, it makes sense that there will be more people engaged in mining/retail/IT/etc
Just because China has more shops than any other country, doesn't mean they're trying to take over "shopping", right?
The original hard forkers are Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik. Two of those 3 are engaged in coding the hard fork of Bitcoin that was commissioned by the NYA. Just because the majority of participants are from the US, it would be a mistake to say NYA is a US initiative to take over Bitcoin.

Consult an accountant for tax and legal advice for your country and state and consult a Bitcoin consultant/service that can advise you on exchange options, anonymity and security. 
You can sell those bitcoin for cash via localbitcoin.com or via an OTC broker. No one need know about your bitcoin and what you choose to do with them. Privacy is the explicit design feature of Bitcoin.
Some pointers, in case you're unaware:
- backup your wallet and do not disclose it, or its private key contents to anyone.
- do not transfer the bitcoin before you have gotten thorough advice on anonymous transactions.
- The date August 1st is significant because of pending disruptions to the network - you do not want to transact BTC in the weeks around this date.
- Due to a potential chain-split and/or hard fork attempt on or after August 1st, there is the possibility that you might double any coins you hold (after Aug 1) as a result. Price disruption can be expected if this event comes to pass.
- Consider consulting  for OTC contacts in North America, Europe and Asia; best practice for anonymity/privacy and for investment advice. You will want to cash out some of your bitcoin holdings but not all - a traditional financial adviser is unlikely to understand the bitcoin market or provide sound advice for this technology.

Agree with your points.
Also, the fact that Electrum is written in Python, which is a popular coding language, makes it accessible to many, and increases the amount of contributions and peer review of the code.
The Open Source relations between Linux, Python and Bitcoin makes for a good combination of familiarity, support and savvy, so Linux users can easily set up an Electrum server - which is built on top of a Core node. Good combination.
Also worth mentioning that the ability to use Tor, to set fees in the way you want, to import/export pub &amp; priv keys in various formats and to easily create both HD and non-HD wallets makes Electrum versatile.

You asked to discuss the article and then the specific statements you listed. I'm speaking from the point of view of those who value a security-first, censorship-resistant Bitcoin.

Instead the cypherpunk tool I'm speaking of - the current Bitcoin -  it's development is informed by science. So, if I state the science like it's self-evident, then that's only because that is the consensus among those who want a robustly secure Bitcoin regardless of its level of adoption.
You're interested in adoption. And there are many who are. Nothing wrong with that - except for the big blocks part, IMO. The fork that the Big-Block-Big-Adoption camp will soon pursue will almost certainly yield massive adoption and a massive price. But there is a cost to pay: degraded security and a sick bed-fellow, the bank.

I think they understand that Core and the cypherpunks will never relinquish the repo.
Even if they managed to get control of the github repo by some attack, GitHub would, by policy, return ownership to the maintainers prior to the hack. Or Core would simply create another repo and perhaps call it "bitcoin-core".
I think its reasonable to assume they want control of Bitcoin's network and brand and market cap. They're doing everything to convince users that big blocks are the route to lower fees, more adoption and a higher price.
They promote the fable and put themselves forward as the enablers. They can steal away much of the current and future user base / network and do so with Jeff "Butter Fingers" Garzik's project fork on BTC1, without having to usurp the current repo used by Core.
Its good, they must make their big block fork and onboard all those people who want bitcoin enterprise for its latest flavor craze. I just want my Core developed censorship-resistant Bitcoin so I can do the things it allows me to do in private.

Now that it is apparent that the incentives of miners and of users are misaligned, SegWit can legitimately be activated via a BIP149 UASF. 
Miners have revealed that they cannot be trusted, in future, to make important network decisions via MASF. They may just side with big business (a la NYA and SegWit2x) even if it risks killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
The argument that "if we don't take action NOW then some other altcoin will take over from Bitcoin" is reactionary. That risk will always exist even without the current contention. In future, even with a perfectly healthy network and mining industry, another altcoin may become bigger than Bitcoin for a period - through nobody's fault, action or inaction. "Bad Things will happen" is not valid logic for trying to steer consensus Bitcoin's destiny.
The present UASF (BIP148) is contentious, its deployment is reactionary. Let the opposition break consensus. The Censorship-Resistant chain must maintain the moral high ground if Consensus is to retain meaning.

SegWit, when it is activated, will change transaction architecture and implement a few protocol optimizations, such as the transaction malleability fix. The overall outcome of SegWit, in terms of capacity considerations, is that it reduces tx fees and reduces the rate of UTXO set growth, thereby reducing long-term blockchain storage requirements.
Following the analogy of road network to Bitcoin network, SW represents an optimization of how the existing road capacity is used. Increasing block size is akin to creating more road space.
Contrary to what most people think, LN does not *need* SegWit. SW would optimise LN but [according to Andreas Antonopoulos]( there is an LN implementation being developed that works without SW.

Some of them will definitely be - many have been for years - but users must choose wisely, as always. Nothing stops you or me from running a Lightning Node, thereby decentralizing the LN layer. 
Contrast this to the current bank-like exchange layer: you and me do not have the option to run Bitfinex or Kraken nodes, but between themselves the exchanges run settlement/liquidity nodes. The exchange layer, which was created by them is a SQL protocol layer, is centralized to participating exchanges who have been bank vetted. 
LN offers a new protocol layer, independent of the exchanges and banks, where anybody in the world can transact small (or large) amounts at reduced fees. No-one is forced to use LN - a person or business can use this open source protocol where it suits their use case and economic needs.


There is no reason to believe that additional protocol layers will be the "only" users of the main chain. The opposite can be argued: e.g. a LN node settles 1000 bitcoin txns (conducted via LN) to the main chain as a single settlement transaction for a miner fee of 0.001 BTC. Had those 1000 bitcoin transactions been individually conducted on-chain, each would have had to pay a miner fee of approx 0.001 BTC. The Bitcoin network would have had to transport, propagate, verify and store 1000 txns, as opposed to 1 tx. 
From a resource perspective that's a  saving; from a block capacity and storage perspective that's a 1000:1 reduction in consumption; from a fee market perspective that is a downward pressure on fee rates.
If we extend the effects to several million txns per day, which LN is capable of, then we begin to see the true scope of scaling and adoption made possible. Blocks of 1MB allow this. Without LN, blocks of 1000MB do not reach millions of txns per day because block size is not the only constraint on txns/second - additional parameters include network propagation speed, mempool capacity limited by RAM, CPU limits in tx and block validation, etc.
You see, its a constellation of relational parameters and considerations that computer science is best equipped to ponder and implement. Scaling of a network is never unlimited, and every decision has trade-offs. These things need to be modeled, simulated and lab-tested by experts. There is no way that a weeping Roger Ver's altruistic call for the world's disenfranchised should over-ride rational scientific endevor.

Soon, according to the promises of the New York Agreement corporate cartel, they will fork a medium security (big block) retaill chain and leave us censorship-resistant luddites in peace.
Of course, a chain-split means that the two tokens must share the prevailing price between them and then discover price again for each chain. This is possibly what is underway in the chart. The hard fork is only scheduled for Oct/Nov and many market participants may frenetically buy to gain maximum coins on both chains, at some point.

I'm stating the general opinion that this was the case. The Bitcoin Core project was never invited, and no developer teams were since this was explicitly a business-centric meeting. 
Some of the Bitcoin Core contributors who also work for  Blockstream got late invitations. The actual details may be more complex and involves "were not invited", then "were invited" and eventually presented with a prepared agreement to sign.
Since the output of the meeting was a technical roadmap, "segwit2x", it is odd that the custodians of the *SegWit* code, namely Bitcoin Core, were neither consulted nor invited. That is why I say Bitcoin Core was "excluded" from the NYA and "segwit2x" formulation. The fact that the NYA then commissioned their preferred developer Jeff Garzik to commit BIP91 to code, underscores the exclusion. 
Who are the NYA participants to presume that they can make custodial decisions on behalf of the network, its developers and its users? 
There is no need to mislead readers or to misrepresent the facts at this stage. The outcome is clear: NYA plan to action a network split via contentious hard fork after *SegWit* has been activated.

Rural workers get paid weekly wages in fiat. They spend it at local markets. They have intermittent electricity and network connectivity. Bitcoin is slow, cumbersome and expensive.
The last thing rural people need is to be burdened with Bitcoin by some well-meaning city-dweller.
Bitcoin was gifted, by cypherpunks, to those who have the means to use it against the state. That's you and me. Let's not put that on the rural poor.

*"medium security retail"* is an accurate description of the use case the NYA participants and those seeking to do on-chain scaling via a schedule of block size increases are pursuing.


This one sentence describes the two main market cultures that have emerged for Bitcoin. The retail market could operate on the same chain as the investment market, if the prominent retail advocates were willing to use (the much better suited option of) layer 2 protocols. Why they must vilify SegWit, sidechains, Core, Blockstream and *anyone who argues for robust security and censorship resistance* is an important pointer in all this confusion.
The statement *"investors are not as sensitive to fees"* seems generally true and also extends to those who use Bitcoin in a way that assures privacy. Here we see the exact context of the frequently misquoted tweet in which Adam Back speculated that some investors would be willing to pay $100 for certain highly valuable transactions".

If we make an analogy between an urban public road network and the public Bitcoin network, then the analogues are:
- road capacity is block capacity
- individual commuters represent transaction outputs (UTXOs)
- each vehicle represents an actual bitcoin transaction
So, a regular P2PKH transaction is like a vehicle containing two people - who represent two outputs: the actual send amount and the change amount.
Every vehicle must pay a toll (mining fee) to travel from A to B through the road network. Unlike a usual flat-fee road toll, this road network allows users to bid for access to the road. So, as congestion increases, users will pay higher and higher fees in order to drive on the road network.
In the case where there is more or less permanent congestion, fees will be permanently high. The self-evident solution is to simply add one or two lanes to the road network in order to increase capacity and relieve the congestion. However, as the linked article discusses, road planners have found, over the years, that increased road capacity (increased supply) almost always leads to increased demand, and the congestion soon returns. This phenomenon is called "[Induced Demand](
Induced Demand and its impact on large public networks warns us that simply increasing block space will not necessarily have the expected outcome of lowering tx congestion and high fees. 
Roadway solutions include reducing the number of private vehicles on the road by incentivising people to travel via buses or a transit system. A bus can hold 50 people and uses less road space than their 50 (or, say, 25) individual vehicles combined. A monorail, built above the highway, can transport 200 people in one trip, and commuters might disembark at stations along the road network from where they take bus routes to their destination. 
The monorail and bus routes represent the Lightning NetWork. The road capacity remains unchanged but it is used more efficiently - reducing congestion and reducing fees. 
Note that the congestion and fee relief is neither constant nor permanent, but the solution is smarter and more manageable than simply increasing block space. It is always possible to add additional monorails (protocol layers) and buses, whereas simple block size increases run into the problems implied by Induced Demand, and soon require another block size increase. Bitcoin security (decentralization) is systematically degraded by larger and larger blocks, so this is an additional concern of only doing on-chain scaling.

Somewhere in the middle of this pile of manure, the writer shows lack of understanding of what *validation* means:


While slandering Core he also shows that he does not see any need for running one's own full node to avoid having to trust a third party's version of transaction history. There are numerous other benefits, that full node operators are well aware of, so no need to list them here, but the writer boldly declares his ignorance and disregard.
The writer interprets Satoshi's statement,


and concludes


And evidently thinks he's climactically bringing the thunder down: 


Well, repeating a statement several times *does not make it so*.
Satoshi's statement reads that mining nodes *will be big server farms* - as most mining operations, in fact, are - and that client nodes (both full nodes and SPV nodes) *only do transactions and don’t generate* - as we see in the real world, today.
Nowhere does Satoshi specify that Bitcoin should be mined *and managed* by companies.
The writer's argumentative style reminds of the blabberings of intellectual midgets like Mike Hearn and Roger Ver. The piece reads like jazz - but jazz without rhythm.
The writer quotes his champion Craig Wright's argument why banks and bank satellites are the best suited candidates to manage Bitcoin:


And here we see the narrow conceptual criteria being applied by the advocates for a corporate Bitcoin: yes, 17mil miners is a big number, but that does not represent *decentralization* in the Bitcoin sense of the word. Those 17mil organizations have a single common denominator: they are bank satellites and serve corporate finance. They have no incentive to further permissionless transactions and a censorship-resistant Bitcoin.
Bitcoin decentralization is characterized by node diversity. Diversity of interest and incentive. If 17mil bank satellites deployed 17mil mining nodes there is no diversity, no decentralization and a single cartel that controls mining.
The banks already manage fiat to the chagrin of citizens and Fairness. To those factions and vipers who want to give the banks control of Bitcoin - you cannot and you will not. Go spin up your own laughable blockchain and centralized token and call it something else, but you will never have this Bitcoin.
It is possible to quote Karl Marx while ignoring his context:


and conclude that he admires the work of the corporations and that these outcomes are good and right - that they justify the banks.
**Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym of a Cypherpunk** - advocate of the Right to Individual Privacy - and not some zany socks, suit-and-tie corporate yes-man. Any interpretation of Satoshi's words, the white paper, and Bitcoin should be made in this context, if it wants to avoid becoming misguided poppycock of the caliber written by Adam Selene and identity fraudster Craig Wright.

There have been both hard and soft forks in the past and they will happen in the future.
SegWit has a scheduled hardfork in its roadmap so the network can upgrade to 2MB blocks.
The Big Blockers want to create BrUndlecoin with a hardfork.
Barry Silbert's BizClub compromise is a hardfork.
Yes, that's a lot of forking, and some of them best avoided, but UASF - a softfork - is unavoidable at this stage. It's not about supporting or rejecting it, the wheels are in motion and every user/business/miner will have to choose a side on 1 August.
Either users force SegWit signaling by miners now with a softfork, or miners choose to signal SegWit of their own volition. Whichever way, there's a network upgrade fork coming up.
I'm not trying to act all stiff-necked about it, its just that those are the cold hard facts.

The point of running a full node is that it is sovereign: you can run any code on there that you like. You can change the Core client code and you can add some code of your own. For example, my full node communicates with all clients but when it encounters a non-Satoshi node it echoes its own user agent name back at it to determine if it is telling different nodes different stories. 
From there it will co-operate with Satoshi compatible clients and lead adversarial clients up the garden path.
BIPs are not all committed to code. Some are, some are not. Not all BIPs need to be locked-in, for example if there is consensus that the network icon in the GUI should be changed that BIP will just be implemented straight to code without any lengthy process.
If you run one version and a new version is released, the Bitcoin Core devs always have the respect to make the versions compatible. However, some version upgrades might not be compatible and for that you need to remain vigilant and informed.
Bitcoin is just experimental code being updated with best efforts - there are no guarantees and there is no nanny nation about its progression between versions - the developers do their best to consider everyone - but those who become complacent risk being left behind.

Bitcoin already is far better, but in terms of its specific strengths: robust security and decentralization. But to have these characteristics it must necessarily be slow (plodding p2p network), expensive (PoW, scarce blockspace) and unreliable (chain reorgs, shifting fees). [As explained here](
Yes, layer 2 protocols will allow near instant, almost unlimited txns per day - and this will certainly exceed PayPal and VISA speed and capacity - but it will be restricted to bitcoin txns, with no integration with the bank system where the system delivers workers' salaries.

Regarding "scaling outcomes", there is an NYA scheduled hard fork to 2MB blocks in Oct/Nov. If they action this, then there will be a chain split because those Bitcoiners who prefer censorship-resistance and the ethos of the Bitcoin Core project will not follow the fork, and remain on the current "legacy" Bitcoin chain.
As a miner you will have to decide which one you support. Probably, you will choose the most profitable chain if money is the main consideration.
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:21:31
When you say "succeeds" it's not clear what specific outcomes you're referring to.
It can be said that Bitcoin has already succeeded because it works according to its intended design:
- a decentralized payment protocol
- solution to electronic double spending
- its own value tokens
- algorithmic consensus
- cryptographic security
- censorship resistance
- etc
From this perspective Bitcoin is now only being improved and maintained as a beta software. Anyone can use Bitcoin, but many people never will. Just like anyone can do exercise for health but few people do.
No-one can control or stop Bitcoin, but some people try to and will most likely continue to try for eternity Sometimes Bitcoin usage increases, driving up fees and price speculation. Sometimes people sell or spend their bitcoin, driving down the price. Less and less usage sees decreasing fees. Fads and bubbles and changing social mood.
Strangely, the whitepaper does not specify Bitcoin as an international reserve or dominant currency - that is not its design objective, although some Bitcoin fans would like to see this - and understandably, given the state of global finance capital. Yet, for Bitcoin to do what it is designed for it does not require that all other currencies and value tokens disappear. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:46:44


I think most people unanimously agree that its high caliber development team and robust security are Bitcoin's primary strengths. Well, "security" is dependent on so many factors - it varies with time and requires developer maintenance and foresight. 


It can be extended but I read somewhere that people tend to gloss over lists with more than 5 bullet points :)
Your point about adding innovations from other altcoins can join the list.


Probably because its the flagship of cryptocurrency: many stakeholders, competing visions for what it should be, and of course - it is money! Some things get slowed down by political wrangling, like the activation of SegWit, but the developers are not sitting on their hands - behind the scenes there is ongoing innovation and improvement.
A reassurance that I've found in Bitcoin is that almost everything about it is slow and steady - the p2p network, the 6 block confirmation time (wait ~1 hour), the consensus mechanism - its a sailing ship rather than a jetski. Civilization is at the peak of the largest credit bubble in history, so of course there is urgency: high speed development, instant transactions, frenetic spending, etc. Bitcoin imposes some sanity that I hope is foreshadowing the future.
As for adoption, we spend a lot of time thinking about and discussing this topic. Again, just like with the protocol, I like to think there is no need to rush. Adoption will happen of its own accord. 
Notice how, now that the exuberance of the price rally has dissipated, the transaction volume has subsided, some people are reporting empty mempools in their nodes, and fees have gone down dramatically. This can be observed after every rally and the rate of adoption has probably slowed right down.
Bitcoin appears to be a barometer of social mood - of the collective psychology of all participants.

I would say that, realistically, that is not "someone" (as in one person), but a collection of buy orders between $2000 and $2200 belonging to perhaps hundreds or thousands of individuals.
They're most likely placing their orders in this range because price is currently at $2250 and $2000 represents psychological support below which they believe price is unlikely to go.
Notice that there is a small number of orders between $1550 and $1650. Interesting that they should choose that level.

When your **bank satellite bitcoin business** becomes less profitable because it runs up against higher tx fees... 
Sure, the version of scaling that implements a schedule of ever bigger blocks will get you more customers. But if you're willing to sacrifice Bitcoin's fundamental security for short-term profits, then it must mean you're *planning to move business to another altcoin anyway*, down the line **when mega-blocks suffer mega-congestion**.
The line 


is FUD. 
Are we running a multi-century project with scientific method? or shall we manage it by hyperbole like it's prom night?
*So what* if some altcoin becomes bigger than Bitcoin. It is inevitable that this happens anyway at some time in the future - who knows what market or political forces will change the tide? 
I guess that's easy to say when one has no debt, and no obligation to investors, and no bank loans that need servicing.
These **businesses that accept bitcoin and convert them straight to fiat**, as a primary business model, are **parasitic**. They add no value to a censorship-resistant Bitcoin or its primary users who seek to store value, transact without permission, and exercise their right to privacy. In fact, these so called "Bitcoin businesses" with their bank imposed KYC, meet and make agreements (SW2x) to degrade Bitcoin security (8MB blocks?) for the sake of their profit. No wonder they exclude the Core developers from such a shameful collusion! 
When these businesses ("economic nodes") started out, the network was young, tx volume low and fees were optional. Yet, they should have thought through the implications of Bitcoin security being dependent on block space scarcity, and the eventual impact on fees.
Now they resort to *populist lobbying* to save their ailing cash cows. Not with this Bitcoin they don't. If they want a centralized corporate blockchain, then they'll have to create a new one.

BTC1 are preparing code to HF to 2MB blocks after SegWit activates, so that's 100%, *but* there is a high probability that the BTC1 developers bork their code, which reduces it to ~75%
ViaBTC and BitMain are visibly gagging on the idea of SegWit in Bitcoin, so they're planning a fork to BitcoinABC, however, they might be all bark and no bite - I'd give their fork a 50% likelihood of even happening.
There are other parties looking to fork, including a potential chain-split by BIP148 UASF if SegWit is not locked-in by Aug 1. So that's a 25% likelihood, I estimate.
All in all, given several potential fork events, the likelihood of at least one chain-split in the coming 6 months is: 75% + 50% + 25% =

these kind of connections may be innocuous or they may be surveillance services who report to the agencies. No way to know and no way to prevent them except by blacklisting. Sometimes they pose as regular peers that report themselves as a Satoshi client. 
You can specify that your client only connect to certain peers and refuses all other connections, but this is not recommended because it relies on trusting those specific nodes.
Just because a spy service connects to you doesn't mean they know your private details. At the most your client is going to provide them a list of IP addresses of the peers you have connected to which may allow traffic analysis and transaction matching to your node's IP.
These are the privacy challenges we face and the core devs are working on them.

You misrepresent what is going on. There is a common perception that layered scaling is somehow being deviously engineered and imposed by Blockchain.
Currently, a majority of daily transaction volume is comprised of settlement transaction from the exchanges to the blockchain. Inside the exchange user hotwallet transactions are typically committed to a MySQL database, as users deposit, withdraw, buy and sell; and then those transactions are periodically settled by the exchange to the Bitcoin mainchain.
Anyone can put their exchange deposit address in a block explorer and see the settlement at work.
How is this not a protocol layer? How is it not settlement? How is layered scaling and tier 1 / tier 2 protocol layers evil? It wasn't even Blockstream's original idea, it came from community developers.


I saw the tweet where he speculates that people might be willing to pay $100 fees "for digital gold and international remittance". And he's right, some people would, but this is not in his power to impose on the network. Fees are determined by the actual rates user are willing to pay.


That is an idea, but just as much as someone can say "Bitcoin was designed for smaller blocks". Easy to say, difficult to substantiate. But seriously, anyone who thinks manipulating blocksize is a means of scaling just simply has not done their homework.


Core designed, coded and tested SegWit. And scheduled a 2MB blocksize increase in their roadmap. How is that stopping scaling?

Controlling Bitcoin and manipulating its price are different things.
Nothing stops anyone, including central banks, from moving price through buying and selling large positions. While a central bank would probably not want to be seen (via the public ledger) to be trading the bitcoin market, there is anecdotal evidence that large shadow banks have been buying and selling in the bitcoin market since 2012.
To control Bitcoin, the protocol network, an entity would have to control a majority of mining hash rate. With the Bitcoin network being the world's largest super computer, that presents a logistical challenge (assuming money is irrelevant). it would immediately be obvious if a new entity's mining power comes online. The preferred method would be to coerce existing large miners. This will always be a risk, but corrective action by developers, users and "honest" miners would quickly restore the network to its decentralized state.

The top comment in that post is reasonable and asks for commentary. Its most upvoted response is unfortunate because it exemplifies the hostility and skepticism that characterizes that rbtc.
Andreas explains SegWit (and some rbtc users admit they had misconceptions cleared up as a result) but some are saying he's "lying" and "trying to sell" SegWit.
Take this comment:


Now Andreas Antonopoulos is myopic too. But what he actually says in the interview is that P2SH txns currently comprise an avg of 14% of all daily transactions. Because SegWit allows script innovation he expects that complex txns (like P2SH) will become more prevalent in future. The rbtc criticism not only misunderstands but turns it into a reason to slander.
Same user:


This is interesting, because if the user didn't hear Andreas right on this point then a lot of other things he said won't make sense. What Andreas is actually referring to is that SegWit introduces Script version numbers in transactions. This means that script innovation becomes possible and this is an exciting prospect.

u/luke-jr , your fire and dedication to this UASF path is admirable. I mention elsewhere in this post that the reactionary stance of UASF is a concern because it mirrors the myway-highway defiance and emotion of the Big Blocks cult.
From a grand perspective, and given the potent political significance of Bitcoin, it can only be expected that progressive users will inevitably have to assert their will versus a powerful adversary: a rogue populist, an obstructive miner/cartel, a malevolent state. 
Yet, is Bitmain's obstruction important enough (in the longterm) to warrant this summoning of people power? Once the speculative rally subsides, fees come down, and Bitmain (and others) no longer have an incentive to stall SegWit. Surely, it would be prudent and wise to hold back a UASF event for a real and urgent threat scenario?
The risk I'm pointing out is that deploying the power of UASF for this temporary setback to SegWit may set a dangerous precedent. The next time the network faces ideological contention or a setback that can be solved with patience, it will be that much easier for a faction (whether majority or not, whether informed or uninformed) to pursue UASF again. Many fickle UASF flare-ups.
Users should absolutely be willing and prepared to assert their will over that of a bad actor or undesirable situation. However, the present impasse can be resolved with patience.

No need to measure their consensus. Fullnodes engage in consensus-seeking among peers according to their consensus algorithms - regarding the chain-tip, block validity, transaction validity, etc
A miner can mine a block yet fullnodes may reject and orphan that block based on their consensus about its validity.
Anyone who wants to transact with confidence will want to verify the full utxo set with their own fullnode. Satoshi specifies this in his design. Whether he expected that they will also be generating coinbase is irrelevant - and he acknowledged this by making the 'generate' function optional in the client.

it's not about good or bad. Its about red pill and blue pill. It depends on which market you're in.
If you're in the Bitcoin market that's about censorship-resistance and storing value, then certain corporate entities are furthering that use case.
If you're in the Bitcoin market that's about more adoption and more transactions because it allows you to pay the bills at the end of the month, then we arrive at the definition of "corporate" that the OP is using.
That's fine for both use cases, and they should both have their way. But the latter group cannot have cypherpunk Satoshi's Bitcoin to play capitalism and bank satellite with.
Would that be right to Satoshi's vision, intention and to the censorship-resistance and robust security of Bitcoin?

The blocksize "debate" has revealed that there are two factions with very different visions of what Bitcoin is and what it should become.
On the surface, the two camps are popularly characterized as follows:
The majority of Core devs, and their supporters, essentially prioritize Bitcoin's censorship-resistance. This camp believes that current blocksize (and only a marginal limit increase) is essential to security and Bitcoin's degree of decentralization.
The big-blocks camp wants Bitcoin to enjoy as wide adoption as possible. There seems to be little concern that bigger blocksizes present a security risk, and some proponents interpret Satoshi to imply that mining *should* be centralized to "server farms run in data centers" and that he had always intended that any blocksize limit should be lifted in future.
Those are rough outlines of the positions of the two camps and they are not full or accurate descriptions of inter-denominational differences or subtleties of opinion.
Whichever way one cuts it, these two camps have irreconcilable positions. There cannot be any compromise and both sides believe that Bitcoin is *their's* - their gift from Satoshi. Both sides want Bitcoin, its brand and its network.
Without discussing the variety of scenarios, and combination of repercussions - intended and unintended - that can play out on 1 Aug, it should be apparent that a chain-split is inevitable.
Any faction that breaks consensus by initiating a fork risks losing Bitcoin altogether.  One doesn't need to think very hard to foresee an outcome whereby the UASF contingent ends up with a chain that is not called Bitcoin *by the largest exchanges*.
Many of the largest Bitcoin businesses (NYA) and miners (NYA, again) seem to be jostling for a Bitcoin without Core and without Blockstream. Don't hand it to them. Let them take it by force - by breaking consensus and initiating a hardfork.
Now that it is apparent that the incentives of miners and of users are misaligned, SegWit can legitimately be implemented via a BIP149 UASF. All those businesses who signed the NYA did so in defiance of Core and Blockstream. All those miners who are now signaling for SegWit2x do so in defiance of Core and Bitcoin's fundamental security. **SegWit2x signaling miners have already put their cards on the table** - they would prefer to be in bed with Silbert and Co. rather than with Core. What does a BIP148 UASF achieve? It's like telling someone who has already stomped on your foot, that you're going to pull your foot away if he ever tries to stomp on your foot.
Miners have revealed that they cannot be trusted, in future, to make important network decisions via MASF. They may just side with big business (a la NYA and SegWit2x) even if it risks killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
The argument that "if we don't take action NOW then some other altcoin will take over from Bitcoin" is reactionary. That risk will always exist even without the current contention. In future, even with a perfectly healthy network and mining industry, another altcoin may become bigger than Bitcoin for a period - through nobody's fault, action or inaction. "Bad Things will happen" is not valid logic for trying to steer consensus Bitcoin's destiny.
UASF (BIP148) is contentious, its deployment is reactionary. Let the opposition break consensus. The Censorship-Resistant chain must maintain the moral high ground if Consensus is to retain meaning.

I have done technical analysis for many years, and apply it to market charts, tidal charts and solar data charts for various research hobbies I enjoy. Experience has led me to not have any doubts about its validity, but as with any analysis based on pattern and derived data, it is not 100% reliable 100% of the time. That just comes with the territory, hence there is the practice of seeking confirmation of technical indications before acting on them.
Prediction of market behavior is a complex challenge, and technical analysis certainly gives an experienced analyst an edge. To have an edge in the market is important, because in the end price speculation is a game of probabilities. In the same way that professional gamblers apply various techniques such as card counting to determine the probability of a certain outcome. However, just like a technical trader, an experienced gambler knows that he cannot win every time, so it becomes an exercise of limiting losses when they do occur. 


You're on the right track with your description of banks (large players), but in practice its actually the other way round: the largest players use their capital power to "set up" patterns that the retail herd then follows, much like dolphins, sharks and whales co-operate to isolate a "bait-ball" of fish.
The largest players have teams of technical analysts and traders that plan and execute market trades over weeks and months. Using the same indicators as them, and identifying their analytical decisions is part of technical analysis. So it goes way beyond what is described in "Learn technical analysis" websites and books. Experience is a vital component.
Of course, its easy to talk and many analysts are wind bags. Here's what a trading method based on technical analysis produces:

Most Bitcoin users are happy with current progress toward activating SegWit, and perhaps the euphoria is relegating concerns over a potential hard fork to the background. Yet, you raise an important issue - not so much a reason for concern but for assessment.
There are two markets for Satoshi's peer-to-peer cash payment system:
- a security-first censorship-resistant store of value
- a medium security retail payment network
Most people who congregate at r/Bitcoin identify with the first market: a high security Bitcoin as brought to us by Bitcoin Core and retained by a layered scaling solution that, ironically, makes possible a high security retail payment network (e.g. LN).
The Big Block camp has made their views clear: they want on-chain scaling via bigger blocks; they are willing to experiment with different block sizes as a means of finding a block size and security "sweet-spot"; some argue that the white paper discourages full nodes and prefers mining via large server farms;  some preposterously propose "firing" the current team of core developers. The crux of their argument is that a schedule of block size increases will allow more transactions at lower fees, and that the core developers are being paid/coerced to keep block space scarce in order to make Bitcoin an expensive network for a wealthy few. The first assertion is hare-brained logic. The latter has no rational possibility in an open source development model governed by consensus.
The arguments offered by the Big Block camp have little (or no) scientific and security justification. So what are they so vehemently arguing for? They are arguing for their use case, and for their market: massive transaction volume and massive mining fees. Layered scaling significantly reduces on-chain mining fees for a short-sighted and ambitious mining manufacturer/operator.
They have been hoping that a groundswell of users would topple Bitcoin Core and instate a new regime, one that is amenable to a medium security retail Bitcoin. To avoid losing the existing network effect, the brand name and the market cap, they would prefer Bitcoin to change hands (to them) rather than have to hard fork a new version.
Without popular support and with Bitcoin Core developer consensus unchanged, the Big Block camp have no option but to hard fork. Perhaps they would have preferred to be able to blame it on an aggressive BIP148 UASF, hence Bitmain's framing of a "contingency plan" BitcoinABC hard fork.
However, there's a twist: the group represented by Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and their investor/personality McAfee, etc do not see eye-to-eye with the participants of the NYA. The NYA's "segwit2x" is not entirely in their interest, and the NYA hard fork to 2MB blocks (planned for Oct/Nov) may not satisfy their larger agenda.
The security implications of liberal block size increases for both BitcoinABC and BitcoinNYA are dire. However, weakened security and increased centralization of those chains do  not negatively impact the legacy Bitcoin chain and holders of its original real-deal token. Hence, why I say, objective assessment, not concern: whoever does *not* hard fork, remains with legacy Bitcoin.

*SegWit* and "SegWit2x" are not the same.
*SegWit* is a set of code - developed by the core devs -
 that implements architectural changes to transactions and adds a few significant optimizations to the protocol. *SegWit* code is already included in the Core client and awaits activation.
"SegWit2x" is a constellation of various things that are all described by that banner term "SegWit2x" - a corporate agreement (aka NYA) to do the following:
- activate *SegWit*, but
- change its  activation mechanism and conditions
- change (shorten) its scheduled dates for lock-in and activation
- have the above code written and overseen by developers who are *not* contributors to Core
- perform a contentious hard fork to 2MB blocks, three
months after *SegWit* activation
The *SegWit* code being activated is the only common denominator. The "SegWit2x" developers may change their forked version of the Bitcoin code in the interim.
The "SegWit2x" scheduled Oct/Nov hard fork to 2MB blocks is widely considered rushed, unsafe and therefore contentious. 
The Bitcoin Core project has roadmapped a HF to 2MB blocks but about a year after SegWit activation to allow for testing and additional features (e.g. block header optimizations) to be included at the same time.
The "SegWit2x" hard fork probably represents the chain-split where the corporate medium-security retail chain parts ways from censorship-resistant legacy Bitcoin.

I disagree, you know?
There is this perceived urgency to scale. What if Bitcoin never scales? As I suspected during the height of the fee drama a few months ago, once the rally subsides and all the overexcited exuberance dies down, fees will go down too. I just had a transaction confirmed for a 0.0006 BTC fee.

You are 100% mistaken. Signature data is currently contained within transactions, and as a final "signed envelope" containing each transaction.
By separating this signature data from the transaction itself, SegWit allows the size benefits (as advertised), as well as, a fix to the malleability problem. The reduction in UTXO set growth is because SegWit discounts the signature ("witness") data and incentivizes users and wallets to create transactions that combine UTXOs and produce fewer UTXOs. That's simple maths if you bothered to read and comprehend the documents you link.
How is it, in Bitcoin, that non-technical people have such strong technical opinions? Don't you feel shame at proclaiming your ignorance here and in rBTC?
Do you really think that in this interconnected globe and with an open source development process, Bitcoin Core developers are lying to the world and each other, when the facts are there to check?

Good analysis,  Markets rarely do what the majority expects. The dynamics and vectors that act on price are varied and complex, and they change according to where the market is in its wave cycle. 
In talking about "the market", we might think its some cold mechanistic entity, but in truth its a *super organism* made up of the collective of participants - and exhibiting their collective psychology. Your comment implies this view, which allows better understanding of market behavior.
So who are the participants? I perceive it like this - and am up for correction/discussion:
In bitcoin we see a majority of small punters - the *sardines and mackrel*, some of them retail traders (active) and many of them buy-and-hold "investors". The latter is a passive group, since their caution and long-term strategy makes them buy relatively small amounts every now and again, and their mindset is to wait and hope.
There is a transient group of consumers and merchants who buy and sell asap at market rate. These are the payment network users who have no significant influence on price since they settle back to fiat within minutes and are not speculating on bitcoin price, so they resemble *diving seabirds*.
Then there are large players - *tuna and sharks* - who actively time the market and seek to buy and sell on a weekly or monthly basis for reasons of cashflow or strategic speculation. Miners, exchanges and many bitcoin service companies fall into this category. They wait for the smaller fish to pile into trends - to form *schools and baitballs* - and then take advantage.
The term "whales" is often used to describe the largest speculative entities that move the market in long-term trends. Their weight and presence is absolute: they can stop price movement at a level they choose and they can push the market higher or lower - aggressively or with coercive nudging (massage). However, gentle whales typically eat plankton, and these entities hunt everything including sharks and other whales, so they fit into the above metaphor as *killer whales*. This category includes the largest exchanges, cartels of large miners, investment funds, and (apparently) a few Wall Street shadow banks. 
Killer whales eat less frequently (in our market metaphor, once or twice a year) and they can also *hunt in packs*. Collusion, strategic alignment, etc. Mostly their hunting strategy is successful, but sometimes they fail. Just because they are large does not mean they always understand market psychology or can correctly anticipate exogenous events.
So with all these entities forming a food chain, it is difficult to predict the market. Barring inside knowledge, the best thing small and medium sized speculators (and, therefore, opportunistic predators) can do is to **follow the whales** by applying technical analysis in the 1-day candle chart.
According to the body of advice from legendary traders, at smaller timeframes, 4hr, 1hr, etc, it is possible to speculate independently, but then, a strategy better than mere guessing (anticipating the market) should be applied. It is a difficult paradigm shift, but the obvious thing to do is to **trade what the market actually does**, rather than making bets on what you, or the herd think it **might (or should) do**.

You seem to misunderstand a critical fact:
**The NYA hard fork to 2MB blocks *is* the chain-split.**
This HF is scheduled for Oct/Nov and represents the birth of their corporate Bitcoin: a medium security retail network with aggressive on-chain scaling.
The Bitcoin Core project and its supporters will still be on the legacy chain, Bitcoin, with 1MB blocks, *SegWit* and censorship-resistance.
There is nothing to fear. The consensus breakers are going their own way. We stay here with Satoshi and the cypherpunks - observing consensus rule.
The bottom line of the objective conditions is that: whoever *does not* fork, gets to keep legacy Bitcoin. BIP148 UASF supporters must see that the politics of the situation has changed.

Bitcoin supporters should remain calm during this period of ideological strife. Two ideologies are competing. We should have seen it coming years ago, as inevitable, yet here we are:
- a corporate Big-Block-Big-Adoption chain
- a Security-First-Censorship-Resistant chain
The chain will split because the political ideologies are irreconcilable.
My observation here, based on the lessons of the Cuban Revolution and the South African Liberation Struggle, is that *supporters of Consensus must retain the moral high ground*.
Let the adversary break Consensus. Let them never accuse us of consensus breach. Do not hand Bitcoin, on a platter, to those who are slobbering for a UASF on August 1st.
There is no urgency for a working, functional Bitcoin. Let renegades break consensus first, let them fork when they can no longer resist the demands of finance capital on their schedule!

I haven't seen substantiation of that fact, but even if true, just because there is an association (once removed) does not mean Blockstream are working on KYC, right?
Anyone who has a bank account or funds their vehicle/mortgage via a bank loan is directly associated with the primary agent of KYC on the planet. That doesn't mean that mortgage holders are developing KYC projects for their families.
At some point one has to descend to the lowest layer of reality. Anyone who has informed themselves of exactly what SegWit does, and how it achieves it; and has read the source code to verify its integrity - after those rudimentary actions technical persons agree: SegWit is an architectural change that brings sanity to UTXO selection so as to lower fees for most transactions. There is no lurking evil or backdoors in the code.
Some say, "ah but, SegWit allows layer 2 and the KYC and evil lurks there". Fact is layer 2, although never formally called that, has existed since the early days of Mt.Gox and every subsequent exchange. Many businesses, like Bitpay and most exchanges, conduct client transactions internally via MySQL protocol and then periodically settle to the mainchain (Bitcoin network). Layered settlement accounts for approximately 80% of daily transaction volume - it can be verified in any block explorer.

The world banking and finance institutions have been taking coordinated and blatant action against cash and open markets for the past century. They own and manipulate national currencies, governments, and regulate markets to their own and their cronies' benefit. That they will take action against Bitcoin is highly probable. Yet, consider what good banning marijuana has done them: the market thrives despite being illegal and heavily policed in every territory of the world.

A lot of opinions and equally valid to my own. Just as you read the white paper and see, at the face value of it, a peer-to-peer payment system *only*; I see a network/protocol that presents us with a tool against state control of money, a tool that allows society to reclaim its right to privacy, as well as a tool that serves as a payment network and highly secure store of value.
You're saying Bitcoin should only be one thing - the face value description of the white paper. I'm saying Bitcoin is many things - that the white paper does not prohibit it.
Technically it is possible to have both a retail payment network and a censorship resistant store of value. Satoshi's wealth and the investment of his cypherpunk collaborators is, after all, stored on the blockchain.


Have they? The few core devs they salary, including CEO Adam Back, have been involved in Bitcoin Core since its earliest days. The Bitcoin Core project continues to be a decentralized open source project governed by consensus and peer review. Blockstream has never tried to change that. 


Bitcoin mainchain has been used as a settlement layer since the first exchange came online. Approx 80% of daily transaction volume consists of multiple input transactions whereby exchanges settle various clients' transactions for the day to the blockchain. This settlement behavior can be verified by running your exchange deposit address through a block explorer. Internally, the exchanges conduct client buy/sell transactions via MySQL protocol (to database) and then periodically settle from this layer (layer 2!) to layer 1.


Early adopter or not, you want your interpretation of the whitepaper. Other parties, some of them also early adopters, are pursuing a roadmap that will see the retail function happen on layer 2. 
There is consensus for this proposal among the core developers - based on a security-first, measured approach that maintains robust security and censorship resistance above all else.
Users with a retail-only interpretation of the white paper, such as yourself, have champions and expression in the "SegWit2x" camp - a corporate collective supported by the miners and the most reactionary elements in the ecosystem.
The way I see this playing out is that - upon the scheduled "SegWit2x" 2MB hard fork event - the two interpretations of the white paper will part ways. You will be rid of Blockstream, Core, Maxwell, Back, Antonopoulos, hodlers, privacy insisters (such as myself) and robust security.

I don't mean to say it cannot be done, but the answer to the question "how does blocksize impact Bitcoin's fundamental security?" is a long answer with many interdependent components. Most people don't get it and that is why this blocksize thing has become such an issue. If more people asked the question and did the research to find the answers then this wouldn't be such a tedious debate! :)
You'll notice that those who argue strongest in favor of increasing blocksize also offer no technical substantiation for their argument.
In a nutshell: 
*hardware*: bigger blocks -&gt; greater storage requirements -&gt; greater cost to run a fullnode -&gt; fewer fullnodes -&gt; less network decentralization and diversity -&gt; more centralization -&gt; weakened security
*bandwidth*: bigger blocks -&gt; greater bandwidth consumption -&gt;  greater cost to run a fullnode -&gt; etc
*latency*: bigger blocks -&gt; longer block propagation times -&gt; longer block validation times -&gt; greater chain-tip contention -&gt; less efficient protocol -&gt; additional attack vectors
*processing power*: bigger blocks -&gt; greater transaction volume -&gt; greater protocol validation volume -&gt; greater cost of CPU power -&gt; greater cost to run a fullnode -&gt; few fullnodes -&gt; etc
*[induced demand]( bigger blocks -&gt; more block capacity -&gt; latent demand rapidly fills new supply -&gt; congestion -&gt; high fees -&gt; back  to call for bigger blocks
There are many other factors and components. I'm sure there are some that I'm not even aware of. The points above are just examples of the type of technical and logistical thinking that means bigger blocks are not the solution to congestion, high fees or a parameter for scaling at all.
In fact, if one looks at the core design feature of Bitcoin, namely, Censorship Resistance, then it is evident that blockspace should always remain scarce, and therefore, expensive - else there is no need to do all of this on a cumbersome, unreliable blockchain.

Yes, there is large tx volume at the moment: 300k+ per day, consistently.
Additionally, some miners are mining empty blocks - for various reasons - so the mempool contains a large backlog of transactions with adequate fees.
The worst case is that you wait until your transaction expires from the majority of nodes' mempools and the coins will show up again in your wallet.
Perhaps your tx gets included in a block before then.

You're correct. Its a matter of transaction volume and fee income per transaction. Thinking about the fee market is not straight-forward because it is only busy developing now and there are many assumptions. We are constantly learning.
Miners rely on the phenomenon of [Induced Demand]( to hike their fee income. Accordingly, each block size increase sees the additional capacity rapidly consumed by latent demand. The network lurches from congestion crisis to congestion crisis, each time justifying a block size increase. 
Since tx congestion causes users to bid fees higher, bigger and bigger blocks imply increasing tx volume - with a fee income windfall at each block size increment's peak congestion phase.
Additionally, a block size increase requires additional capacity to store those larger blocks, to transport them and to validate them. The increased tx volume increases bandwidth consumption as well as CPU load for validation per block period. All of these imply increased cost for miners and full node operators.
Hence, each block size increase prices out weaker competitors from a strong miner's perspective.
Those are the main dynamics that make larger blocks attractive to powerful miners. Having the ability to *choose* block size is a monopoly miner's ideal scenario because he can manipulate both the fee market and competitors at will.
The explanation given above is missing from the public narrative about block size, because the proponents of Big Blocks hide their profit motive and, instead, use emotional manipulation to convince users that Big Blocks are needed: to ensure equal opportunities for the poor and disenfranchised of the world. Such justification combined with smear campaigns against the Bitcoin Core contributors, is insincere.

There's a lot of hype around smart contracts and their potential. The standard example is the assurance contract, such as the "[Lighthouse]( which is basically a crowd-sale smart contract governed by code - however, it necessitates a 3rd party "oracle", so kind of futuristic...
The most practical application of the smart contract principle, currently, is *multi-signature transactions*. These allow for fairly complex escrow implementations with binary outcomes. The benefit is that none of the traditional 3rd parties (notary, jurisdictional authority, etc) are required.
As mentioned in another comment, the benefit of "smart contracts" is that the code becomes law and arbiter. What was agreed to and implemented at the outset is exactly what will transpire at the end. Hence, in the majority of cases (depending on foresight at implementation) there is no need for third party decree or legal recourse.

Fair point, yet consider that LN (and other layer 2 protocols) are simply settling to the Bitcoin layer periodically, so its not so much a matter of wondering if it will work as looking at existing examples of settling.
The exchanges have been doing layered transactions and settling since the early days. An exchange's internal hot-wallets are typically run from a SQL database. So the SQL protocol can be thought of as a distinct layer. Periodically, user withdrawals are settled to the Bitcoin mainchain via many-in-many-out transactions. This simplifies transaction scheduling and reduces fees from the exchange's perspective.
You can see this settlement in action by running your exchange deposit address through a block explorer.
Funny then, that those who allege that layered scaling was conceived by Blockstream as a ploy to control Bitcoin and profit from LN, are simply ignorant of what has been going on in the mainchain for years already.

Bitcoin is programmable money and a censorship-resistant protocol. To maintain its robust security, Bitcoin's block space must inevitably be a scarce resource, meaning Bitcoin is expensive, in terms of both its technology and its transactions.
Using such an expensive Bitcoin requires that we consider what Bitcoin is suitable for, and what not. In a world economy where consumers are over-stimulated to spend, buying coffee and other unproductive expenses are perhaps better done via fiat cash or card.
The imminent Lightning Network will allow almost unlimited, near-instant bitcoin micro-transactions at relatively low fees. But, even then, why use highly valuable bitcoin for casual purchases?
Edit: Buying coffee using bitcoin is like hunting for bird using an AK-47 loaded with gold-tipped bullets. Can be done but what a waste of ammunition. Better be some incredibly tasty cup of coffee...

There are several but I am reluctant to recommend because I don't know your OS or particular circumstances. It's worth researching. Using the same password manager across different platforms (e.g. laptop and phone) would allow you to share the same data file of passwords.
As for being reluctant to store all passwords in the same place, consider that the typical password that is generated by the human mind (and therefore easy to remember) can be cracked within hours by the many botnets that exist only for this task. The Bitcoin botnet cracks a 64 character hash every 10mins!
So it really makes sense to let a password manager generate at least 32 character hashes of random characters, symbols and numbers for you to use as passwords. The passwords, and other data you put in there (such as seeds) are stored encrypted. You should then choose one passphrase (like a sentence that includes numbers and symbols) that is at least 12 characters long.
Bottom line: If you can remember the password that decrypts the file that stores your wallet seed, then it probably is a weak password that can be cracked in a matter of hours or days. If it is a "strong" password then it will be difficult to remember (and easy to forget) - especially if you try to remember several "strong" passwords. Hence it makes sense to let a password manager do the work for you and to then only have to remember one super strong password.

There is a qualitative difference in the case of Bitcoin's protocol layers, in that the transactions that happen in other layers are still bitcoin transactions. So, its not a case that the layers transmit other coins or "pseudo-bitcoin". The are real bitcoin for which you hold the private keys and which are represented and accounted for in the main chain.
It's much like the current, existing layer utilized by exchanges. Users send their bitcoin to an exchange where the bitcoin enters a SQL database layer, are bought &amp; sold (via database protocol), until withdrawn back to the mainchain. Of course, there is a risk that the exchange steals the coins or gets hacked, but this is the risk of every transaction: that the receiver does not fulfill their part of the deal.
Layer 2 protocols, such as LN, are not meant to substitute Layer 1 (main chain) - their purpose is to facilitate micro-transactions at lower fees and higher speed. Paying for a VPN via LN is far cheaper (in terms of fees) and more convenient than a cumbersome main chain transaction. Transmitting $10k worth of bitcoin via main chain is far more secure and the fee % lower, so no need for LN in this use case.
I agree, corruption is a scourge. Bitcoin removes the need for trusted middle-men and their permission for us to transact.

Very interesting. The use of the word "quantum" seems to be a bamboozle, because what they're actually illustrating with this experiment is that electric field charge (polarization) is synchronized between paired ("entangled"!) particles.  The distance is irrelevant because the (instantaneous) data carrier is the Aether. Forgive my know-it-all statement, but this phenomenon, though new for mainstream Quantum Physics, has been researched for quite some time in Plasma Physics.
When this becomes better understood and controllable it will fundamentally change data transmission and electronics (i.e. ASICs) and ~~definitely~~ probably require a change of PoW algorithm!

Its not 1000s but the size of the gold (paper) derivatives market is estimated to be between 50x to 100x larger than the actual physical gold in existence, [judged by the state of affairs at the largest player in this market]( This means that the total of all open gold trades is far in excess of the actual gold it is based on.
What does it matter?, some ask - surely, if someone is foolish enough to trade that then they willingly take the risk. There are several issues:
* 1) leveraged "paper" trades directly affect the price of the underlying physical gold
* 2) a single unregulated shadow bank controls most of the "paper" gold market
* 3) gold ETFs, when they make trading losses or go bust, don't give back your money (or the supposed gold).
There is no reason why a bitcoin ETF would be more ethical, trustworthy, or not enjoy the same "protection" from its cartel regulator.

Sensible writeup.
Although there is no objective evidence for my opinion, I believe there is circumstantial evidence that certain economic interests (most Bitcoin businesses that can be classified as bank satellites, including most miners) are colluding around a planned chain-split.
It is in their financial and ideological interests that there is a big-block chain that will stimulate more adoption, more fees and be centralized to their collaborators.
Of course, this plan and vision cannot be achieved with the current Core devs because they are principled and maintain strong security and hence small blocks in the interest of censorship resistance. So, part of the network must be hijacked from Core and its supporters, for the Big-Adoption chain (Wucoin, as you call it).
Wu, I believe, is only an agent of theirs, not the primary antagonist. Even Ver is a potential liability to them due to his limited vision and emotionality, but a good frontman for the time being.
The BA chain will definitely gain more users and economic support than the Censorship-Resistance (CR) chain. The majority of people now flooding into Bitcoin have little understanding of the value of censorship-resistance and decentralization, and their direct correlation to Bitcoin's security. Hence, the BA chain should logically have a higher exchange price too.
As matters stand, the exchanges have chosen a new ticker symbol for each new potential chain-split coin, so the CR chain will remain known as "Bitcoin" and BTC.
Some years down the line when the BA-chain is wracked with political infighting and continuing threats to fork, as well as the inevitable centralization, the CR-chain's value will regain esteem.

Once all 21mil bitcoin are in circulation and the coinbase reward has dried up, the miners still have plenty of work mining blocks every 10mins. 
Every transaction competes for blockspace, so users attach a transaction fee (or "mining fee") to encourage (incentivise) miners to include their transaction in the next block.
Fees worth approx. 220 BTC/day are being paid to miners, so that is what motivates miners to do what they do. Prevailing price is approx. $2300 per bitcoin, @ 220 BTC fees/day = $0.5mil fees during the past 24 hours.

Its not about the computational cost to the user - that part is negligible. Transaction fees are calculated per byte of data that the transaction contains (not the tx amount in BTC). Miners run a selection algorithm that prioritizes the most profitable transactions. They're running a business in a highly competitive industry where miners either pay the bills or become insolvent. Cut-throat pirate business - in Star Wars terms: a techo-union race for profits - they'll sell their grandma if it means they can survive another month to try hitting some block solutions for precious bitcoin, which they sell for fiat straight away to pay the bills - a low level of existence.

Core dev Eric Lombrozo [remarked recently]( that it has become apparent that there is a divergence of incentive between miners and users, and that Core has perhaps made an error to ask miners to activate SegWit (that is not in their immediate interest) and that Core is unlikely to ask miners to active protocol upgrades in future.


Blockstream employs ~3 core developers. Someone was going to employ them, and I'd rather it was Blockstream than Microsoft or the FBI. Other companies and institutions employ some of the other core devs and there are more than 100 core contributors and an open process of peer review and consensus. Hence, its debatable that Blockstream has "overreaching influence". Rather it would seem that miners would prefer the entire Core consensus, that values Bitcoin's cypherpunk ideals, was absent so miners and parasitic Bitcoin businesses can kludge Bitcoin to their profit motive and deference to the the banks.
Anyone, who has their eyes open, would agree that there is a coup attempt playing out. Back in 2013, there was a lot of talk that Bitcoin would not be banned but be be co-opted - well here it is. The question is how to respond to it. Reaction may not be the correct tactic. It is best to just frustrate the adversary. In the final analysis, the faction that does *not* fork, gets to keep legacy Bitcoin.

Jeff Garzik, has made contributions to Bitcoin Core in the past, and has written several interesting pieces of code, including widely used mining clients, etc.
However, he stopped contributing to Core several years ago when Gavin Andresen, Mike Hearn and he ran up against opposition to their campaign to generate emotion around transaction fees as a means of motivating a schedule of blocksize increases.
Garzik also owns a company called "Bloq" that deploys private blockchains and is developing blockchain KYC technology for the banks and government. This is problematic, morally and contextually because it reveals how far Garzik is willing to go while he applies his talents to the corporatization of Bitcoin.

I suspect it's not the case. The censorship-resistant (CR) side are predominantly computer scientists and cypherpunks. They will not budge on scientific method and security (privacy). The Big Blocks (BB) side are predominantly Bitcoin businesses and miners - so-called "economic nodes". Arguably, their primary motive is profit and adoption is a direct route to more income. 
Their objectives and market share are different; their tactics to achieve their objectives are different. The CR side abides by the [Cypherpunk Manifesto]( the BB side thinks its twatty or doesn't understand it.  The CR side can see what the BB side wants to do - their profit motive over-riding security, and the manner in which they misrepresent both the CR side and their own true motive. 
Therefore, the BB side discards the primary fact that Satoshi Nakamoto is a Cypherpunk, and interpret his words out of context. Appealing to do-goodery and global inequality as their motive for increasing block size. Decrying the evil of the banks and governments, while they get right in bed with them by applying KYC and calling for regulation of Bitcoin.
The CR side sees this and opposes it with reason and science, as opposed to slanderous or emotive rhetoric.
The BB side could have created their own altcoin with mega-blocks years ago. But the fact that they want Bitcoin reveals their true motivation: their profit motive means they hunger for Bitcoin's established brand name and market cap. But it belongs to the cypherpunks.


This might be the case. The proposal should be simulated and lab tested. It can be presented to the world whether the results are positive or not. It would be a critical research paper, but no-one has done it because computer scientists know that the cost and effort do not justify the outcome: induced demand predicts the outcome: the extra block space will rapidly be consumed, probably within weeks or months, and the previous congestion will return and fees rates will vary according to economic supply and demand. Decentralization and network diversity will degrade - even if just slightly. 
More transactions, same congestion, same high fees, more traffic through the protocol network, larger blocks, more expensive, fewer miners and full nodes, creeping centralization, security sacrifice. What was the benefit? we have to ask. More adoption, sure. But in exchange for less security and the same high fees.
The forked BitcoinNYA chain will be an interesting case study.

The article makes a false comparison and the author has erroneous conception:
"The more people who use it, the more valuable it becomes." 
This seems logical, but is not true in any market anywhere. Greater adoption does not equate to an increase in price. The reason is because there is a fundamental disconnect between value and price.
The Bitcoin network has value based on its degree of decentralization and ongoing observance of the Rule of Consensus.
The bitcoin price chart, on the other hand, is an unregulated open market where the exchanges do insider trading, where large players such as investment funds and shadow banks both speculate and hedge.
Yes, the block reward halving will raise the base price, but buying into the expectation two months before the fact is naive and just ignores the way this chart (and other commodities) have historically moved.
Commodities (including bitcoin) typically start a rally from a decisive low - not from a 6 month strain against resistance ($470)

Well, this is the thing: why would bitcoin be the primary currency?
There are billions of people in rural South America, Asia and Africa who cannot, for practical reasons, use bitcoin in their everyday lives: poor connectivity, unreliable electricity, illiteracy, etc. Many local economies just don't have use cases for cryptographic security and programmable money.
Why subject them to a currency they cannot use? Paper cash works well for them right now. If the paper currency could be backed by gold or bitcoin that would be even better because then the paper ceases to be fiat.
Still, if some packer/stacker somewhere wants to use gold currency, he should be allowed to and not have bitcoin forced down his throat hole. Similarly, if Larry Summers and swathes of conventional guys would prefer a traditional bank with debit cards and NIRP, they should be able to use it.
Bitcoin does not have to replace everything to be useful. Think of the future of finance as a hybrid of many things - not just one thing, right?

I appreciate the conversation and the manner in which we've conducted this is respectful and productive because it allows us to understand our very different perspectives.


You state your position sincerely and I believe you.


I think a split will allow both sides to pursue their vision in relative peace. I also intend to hold - and trade - both tokens.
I still believe that it is possible to have both retail (more transactions, more adoption) *and* investment (security-first and privacy) markets co-exist on the same chain. If only those who are about to fork were willing to use layer 2 as a means of achieving more tx throughput at lower fees. The exchanges have been conducting this layered settlement since the beginning, and it will no-doubt remain their practice on both chains.
The reasons for the development of two opposing camps and the eventual outcome make for fascinating study: of history, anthropology and of human and group psychology.
The name "Bitcoin" is not that important to me, I understand that the corporate players need the branding for continuity of market awareness and profit. However, I'm not sure the cypherpunks are so indifferent or have any reason to "gift" the name to those who fork. The exchanges will probably be the ones who make the decision.

The article contains some misrepresentations of alleged SegWit security flaws, but it also misrepresents BU, so those  matters aside, the critical flaw in the writer's attempt at objectivity is that he does not consider the correlation between blocksize and fundamental security.
Without factoring in the [supply-and-demand challenges of scaling large public networks]( this would seem a reasonable conclusion:


Without rudimentary comprehension of how blocksize impacts security, it may seem like increasing blocksize is an outcome that is as inevitable as a stripper removing her clothing.

The linked wiki article is an interesting discussion but it makes some assumptions that are not necessarily true. The very definition of inflation/deflation, today, is inverted from what it was even 40 years ago.
Here is an explanation in relation to bitcoin: [
@_date: 2016-07-12 06:00:51
You must have noticed that most of the big voices in this field are not responding to this thread. There could be many reasons and two of them are that your write-up does not add any new knowledge to the field, and that the notion of big blocks for the Bitcoin blockchain is all but buried by consensus. The software projects allowing this dream to become reality were out there but miners opted not to adopt them.
In fact, statements by miners, and their public discussions about the topic make clear why they prefer the route proposed by SegWit and the Core developers. Miners have expressed their consensus in various ways - primarily by the node software they choose to run.
[SegWit was proposed]( and *being tested* before GitHub forks for XT, Unlimited and Classic existed. It can, therefore, be argued that a concrete proposal had put fire under the tails of those who did not share this vision for Bitcoin. Hence, your statement


is incorrect and plays into the hands of those who seek to paint a picture of the Core devs as a bunch of out-of-touch incompetents. In fact, core developer discussions about scaling challenges had covered - years ago - all of the arguments and incumbent scenario maths that is rehashed in your write-up. I recognize your effort, but the scenario you sketch has been weighed, measured and rejected many times before.
That the protocol can handle millions of daily transactions with bigger blocks is no secret, but it is not sufficient grounds for actually implementing bigger blocks. The idea has not fulfilled Satoshi's requirement of *near unanimous agreement*. Discussions exploring *why* there was no consensus revealed that many felt that considerations of the degree of decentralization (i.e. security) of the blockchain outweighed the need for (and demand of) immediate increases in transaction volume (i.e. adoption). Most were open to the idea but wanted, as per the requirements of empirical science, to see tests and model simulations.
The objective of global adoption is, reasonably, a "good thing", but practically it would be irresponsible to embark on a path of capacity increases that result in unobserved protocol load, without solving more elementary bugs in Bitcoin Beta, such as *tx malleability*. The consensus, as also expressed by miners, is that small incremental steps are preferable to well-intentioned, but high-risk, attempts to extend joy to the world. The utilitarian value of Bitcoin for international society is tremendous, but the requirement to walk before one can run applies without reserve.
Valuable insights have come out of the public debate during the past several years. Some of them pertain to how fragile Bitcoin's security (hence, *censorship resistance*) is in the context of a world that is only discovering the practical and philosophical implications of Consensus. A maximum *degree of Decentralization* is key. Miners voiced concerns about 8MB block propagation - this is well documented - and they voted with their choice to remain with 1MB. Certainly, a thumb-sucked schedule of blocksize increases risks unknown unknowns in the future. We need to observe protocol data after the proposed SegWit blocksize increase before we can define the parameters of the next increase (or, potentially, decrease).
Another important vector, that most big block proposals ignore, is the law of [Induced Demand]( This law expresses itself in most [large capacity systems]( and is factored into the scaling decisions made for transport networks and other society-wide frameworks such as health care. Not factoring the phenomenon into Bitcoin scaling debates is not smart: because, experientially, increased capacity (supply) often stimulates increased demand for excess resource. This can easily lead to ordinary Bitcoin users subsidizing governmental and corporate use of the blockchain for their (opportunistically cheap) settlement needs.
I can go on, but I think there is sufficient justification, above, for my original point that your write-up contains several assumptions and incorrect/baseless statements. Bitcoin is complex. It is highly political both within and without the ecosystem. By design, Bitcoin is more than a mere payment system. Its protocol consensus is enforced by miners, and while general users should be educated and informed, raising this debate - at this late stage - only generates contention.
To my mind the logical chain: *bigger blocks =&gt; wider adoption =&gt; price chart increases*, is a fallacy. However, if there is a dissenting faction who insist on testing this belief, then I encourage them to deploy ClassicCoin. With its own large block blockchain - not the Bitcoin blockchain - because the Bitcoin blockchain and its supercomputer have already voted, with $10bil, for smaller blocks, SegWit, maximal decentralization, security and experimental science.

I guess "better" is not the appropriate word. Bitcoin and fiat are different in everyday use - especially fungibility (ease of spending).
As you also manage to read between the lines: a global deflationary period will strengthen the spending power of fiat *cash notes*. The "cash notes" part is important because during previous deflations there had also been an accompanying drying up of liquidity. This is the time when money in the bank becomes inaccessible. Bitcoin does not have this problem.
But, yes, the unexpected result of credit deflation is that fiat cash notes become highly valued, as the amount of money (cash + credit) shrinks in relation to the amount of goods and services in the economy. The effect is that everything becomes cheaper.
Depending on the BTC/USD exchange rate, this also translates to bitcoin. However, as we know, many everyday necessities are not payable in BTC, so that's where cash notes are most useful. Bitcoin has powerful features beyond just paying for things, but hopefully more goods and services will be payable via Bitcoin in the coming years, hey?

You should not berate yourself or hold on to that regret - throw it in the dustbin of history where it belongs. Many comments here, correctly, point out the unfortunate truth about our existence:
Human psychology has the majority of investors buy near the tops and sell near the lows. Even central banks (with their armies of PhDs) exhibit this behavior in the timing of their gold purchases and sales. 
Had you initially bought when a bitcoin was selling for cents, you may well have sold at some inopportune time, and bought back in much higher, hodling - at a loss - for years of your life. The only fact that matters is that **there is always another opportunity in the market**.
Resolve to do it right starting from today: [learn technical analysis]( buy and sell according to a tested method (and not emotion or psychological impulses). You can and will make a fortune in this market if you only apply *patience* and *discipline*.

Its all in the exchange's orderbook. The principle of any market is that for every buyer there is a seller, and vice your versa. A core dynamic that is often overlooked is that **Sellers and buyers are either active or passive**. 
Active Buyers buy from the available sell orders that were placed above price by passive sellers. 
Active Sellers must sell to passive buyers who have placed buy orders below price. 
That's it. The amount of buying and selling that happens shifts in correlation with social mood.
These two basic principles of market activity also illustrate why increased adoption does not *necessarily* cause a price increase. For example, one passive seller can place a sell order for 1000 BTC immediately above price and sell 1 BTC, each, to a thousand active buyers and price will not increase, eventhough a thousand new adopters have joined the market.
The orderbook is populated with the asks and bids of _passive_ buyers and sellers. It is the balance of *active* buyers to *active* sellers who actually consume those orders and cause price to move.

I think you misunderstand my meaning. I'm not saying "worth as much" in terms of price. I'm referring to value. I say "as valuable as", and qualify "fundamental value" and finally make the same point you do about BTC and BCC price parity:


Yes, the tokens' exchange prices are different now, and that is exactly what the OP leverages, in a his counter-intuitive but clever offer:
Irrespective of the price difference, demonstrate your belief and confidence that the BCC chain has the same fundamental value as the BTC chain it has forked from by exchanging the tokens 1-for-1. 
If the chains are of equal value then the tokens will eventually have the same value too. i.e. "put your money where your mouth is".
The challenge is not about price, its about value.

Another poster also highlighted this gem from the article. The statement is interesting because it seems to point at a more reasonable monetary policy, yet it is humorous because it unashamedly includes to many inversions of reality:
For almost 100 years, and certainly since 1971, there is no distinction between (monetary) "policy makers" and central banks. 
* (1) Central banks are the monetary policy makers
Central banks already completely control the "amount of money in the economy" (money supply). They do this via monetary policy in (1), above. The article implies that monetary policy and money supply is somehow beyond the control of cenbanks and done by private banks.
Private banks are satellites of their national central bank. The central bank will set various policy rates such as reserve rate, deposit rate and interest rate that will all work in concert to determine how much money the private banks can conjure. So while it is true that private banks "can create money on their own" it is only true because 
* (2) private banks are the designated faucets for cenbank money supply
If I understand the article correctly, the sense is conveyed that cenbanks will print cryptocurrency in lieu of paper money. They will certainly not seek to destroy value in the economy, so
* (3) cenbank-crypto will still represent the total current money supply: cash in circulation **plus** credit.
And there is the rub: nevermind the *pretzel logic* of what they intend to do with *pretend* blockchains, the cenbank-crypto will contain within it the full destructive power of a global debt economy: the high risk, unstable debt of the largest credit bubble in history.
I perceive that the central banks are fully aware of their dilemma of being at the deflationary end of a credit expansion cycle - it seems they're going to try to "magic" their way out of it by bamboozling the world with nonsensical distributed ledger tech and "new, better money". Its not, if it inherits and disguises the same toxic debt that has been scraping along the Titanic's hull since the start of the millenium.
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:19:20
The role of a national central bank can roughly be summarized:
1. mandate to issue and manage national currency
2. determine and apply monetary and economic policy
3. authority over national retail banks (who are also its stock holders)
Bitcoin algorithmically achieves 1.
The notion that central bank policy has any effect in the real economy is debatable. History shows that central banks, like most market participants, tend to take exactly the wrong action at the wrong time. Hence, their control over the economy, via monetary and interest rate manipulation, is only *perceived*. The economy functions *despite* central bank manipulation, not *because* of it. So, central bank economic intervention is unnecessary.
Regarding point 3, the cenbanks apply their rates and monetary policy via the retail banks. Credit is conjured via an accounting trick at the central bank. The credit is then injected into the consumer and enterprise markets via the banks, who multiply the credit via fractional reserve. Credit allows for inflation - perceived to be economic growth in a latter-day economic understanding - and consumers need to take on more and more credit to buy things they cannot afford without essentially becoming debt slaves - to the bank.
Bitcoin can replace the monetary issuance and management role of central banks, but it cannot fulfill the central bank's psychological and economic role:
While there is a **global culture of indebtedness and mindless consumerism** - buying non-essential goods and services by selling future labor (credit), the central banks are entrenched. Society needs them for keeping the debt cycle alive and society is, therefore, psychologically dependent on them.
Enticing people to use Bitcoin does not surreptitiously get Bitcoin to replace fiat and central banking. The fact is that Bitcoin can just as easily be used to create credit and debt. Look at exchange bitcoin/fiat lending platforms such as OKCoin and Bitfinex and many others.
Credit is credit and the world economy is based on it. Consumers want it, encourage it, and keep it alive - whether the credit is created via fiat or bitcoin.
The essential problem with central banks is that they implement debt economy from the highest level. Individuals can opt out of using credit (and to some extent fiat) in their own lives - and Bitcoin allows that - but expecting Bitcoin itself to eliminate central banks like mist before the sun, is not reasonable. I would argue that Bitcoin was not designed for this purpose. Perhaps, when society's need for credit has faded, the cenbanks will have little hold over them. When governments serve citizens and do not entrust management of national currency to banks, then the need for Bitcoin would also dissipate.

Yes, the derivatives market is nebulous and not easy to understand or explain. In a nutshell, it applies margin credit (and therefore leverage) to tradeable contract instruments (the "paper") that represent the asset.
Regulators are in essence centralized oversight bodies that ETFs, etc need for perceived credibility. The regulators, in fact, have their hands tied but continue existing because, well, their officials and workers want to continue working; and because the investment world needs to satisfy appearances and banking laws. 
A decentralized and meaningful Bitcoin is, of course, uncensorable, and cannot be regulated. For example how does a regulator contribute or enforce its consensus on the blockchain...
ETFs are a bad idea and should not be invested in - even if they offer a derivative instrument based on Bitcoin. The only secure bitcoin is the one you hold in your private wallet.

I've also been watching the Collapse porn for several years with no money-shot forthcoming. Inspired by the thoughts of several [thinkers about economic recession]( I look at it like this:
The current credit expansion cycle began in 1971 when currency was cut loose from any and all asset backing. The creation of fiat currency (apparently) allowed for infinite credit creation (debt economy).
There have been several crises since and the last one, in 2008, has been the most severe. We're still in it.
There have been two similar credit collapses in history: one happened in the 1830s and the other came to a head in 1929, but neither compares to the sheer scale of the credit created during the past 40 years. 
In both of the earlier cases there were leading periods of several years during which economic doomsaying was fashion. Yet, there was a lull in such rhetoric for several months prior to the respective collapses, since the prophecied moments seemed to never materialize... and when the majority least expected it, when they were invested to the max, believing a corner had been turned...
It appears the cenbanks have run out of options and tricks to keep the confidence scam going. But, it seems they've found a "wildcard" in DLT, that they're going to sell to a captive audience (who understand little about blockchain and its fragile decentralization/consensus core) as the silver bullet that will solve the whole mess.

had posted my reply in the thread linked above.
For easy reference and relevance, here is my reply from that thread:
During 2015, I dedicated several months to research Bitcoin scaling. Much of what I learnt was thanks to pointers from the core devs, and also from existing research of large capacity network scaling.
My eventual summary article was published via a few outlets and made enough sense for Dr Adam Back to publicly endorse it:
Later I began looking into the argument put forward by Pieter Wuille: namely that the Law of Induced Demand applies convincingly to the Bitcoin network:
The larger the network being studied, e.g. public road networks, or public health systems, the more applicable the principle of induced demand seems to become:
So, it is a scientific caution that a precedent exists whereby increasing supply (blocksize) will very soon see the demand rise to meet it (congestion -&gt; high fees). There are large entities out there that will rapidly consume cheap blockspace.
That's all still separate from the fundamental security concern of even just doubling blocksize. Those populists demanding larger blocks are either ignorant, or they know exactly why they're trying to weaken Bitcoin.
We have to be vigilant: rash, unscientific, untested and non-simulated changes to the protocol are irresponsible and contrary to the slow deliberate development pace Bitcoin requires.
One can be in Bitcoin for the price, but that goal overlooks the fundamental features: censorship-resistance, security, long-term robustness. Even with a long-standing insistence on caution and step-by-step change, price has more than doubled. Logically, the core devs' security-first approach is WHY price has increased.

Personally, I use a bank account as receiving destination for fiat I buy with bitcoin from a local exchange. I could sell the bitcoin via localbitcoin and do the transaction person-to-person for cash in exchange for bitcoin, i guess. Other than that I personally don't use or need the bank.
However, bitcoin exchanges need the bank. They cannot do business without the bank - well in so far as they allow customers to link their bank accounts to bitcoin trading accounts. Also, the bitcoin exchanges are dependent on their primary banker for fiat liquidity. The fact that the exchange holds customer BTC or fiat in their useraccount, fulfills the description of a bank to some extent.
If we acknowledge that many people will be using paper money (whether representing gold or bitcoin) for decades to come, then opportunity will exist for a business that issues, exchanges, or stores those paper moneys.
The functions of a bank is one thing - the practice of modern banking - and the head of the beast, central banking - is another matter. Away from our perception of banking and what it should or shouldn't do, the business model of a bank is intrinsic to money, money transfer and financial utility - even in the case of Bitcoin. Of course, there will be those luddites who keep a centralized fiat banking model going, even when we have progressed to transparent, open and accountable forms of bitcoin banking.
As far as the wider economy is concerned, and global finance, it has its fulcrum around the banks who are market makers for the world's national currencies in which all business transactions are settled. Until this systemic state changes, those banks will exist. Bitcoin and its blockchain will force them to change, but their role will not vanish. For individuals, Bitcoin can render the bank irrelevant, if the person can free their income and expenses from dependency on the bank. Earning (getting paid in) bitcoin is the primary step.

* Reinstall Bitcoin Core and then copy your existing wallet.dat file to the *bitcoin* folder (not sure where this is located in Windows).
* Start the QT wallet and follow [these instructions]( from Bitcoin StackExchange to dump your private keys.
You should be able to do the above without needing to download the blockchain first.
* Next, create a non-seed Electrum wallet and import the private keys using [these instructions]( from the Electrum documentation. 
The reason for needing a non-seed Electrum wallet is that a seed version cannot import a private key that was not generated from its seed. You *can* use a seeded wallet but then you have to "sweep" the private key which will cost you a transaction fee for a non-essential transaction. Why spend when you can save, right?

An ETF creates "paper" bitcoins. The fund effectively takes your money, gives you a piece of paper that promises to pay x amount of their "ETF bitcoins", and the fund then invests the combined investors' money within the parameters set by whoever regulates them.
The investor does not  control any private keys and does not receive any bitcoin until they cash out and claim "physical" bitcoin in exchange for the ETF "paper" profits/losses.
Some argue that ETFs allow US working people to allocate their preferred asset classes to their IRA or 401K, etc. Depending on one's degree of trust in those managing such funds and the at-risk banking sector that underpins it, these "sensible" vehicles more and more frequently lose or go bankrupt with no recourse for the pensioners.

Wall Street and "the banks" are interested in Bitcoin's blockchain only because it involves *money* and they imagine they will capitalize by implementing the technology that drives it. Although Bitcoin is underpinned by its blockchain, there is something else that drives it. The banks will eventually realize that having a blockchain without Bitcoin is meaningless for their intended use case. 
How can that be? Bitcoin's blockchain only has meaning because it is decentralized and operates by consensus. Incentivized miners enforce consensus and decentralization. So how will these large centralized entities incentivize other entities to mine their blockchains?
If they manage to do that - to attract miners that decentralize and influence consensus on their blockchain - then they will have made their own centralized role irrelevant. Why would they willingly do that?
The other side of the catch 22 for "the banks" is that, if they do not decentralize their blockchain, then they can only be running a centralized (crony consensus) pretend "blockchain". So, why choose "distributed ledger tech" then?. Their current SAP database is both cheaper and faster. Damned if they do. Damned if they don't. 
They're confused. Bitcoin's blockchain is not the whole truth - a nebulous political ingredient is the real driver. By praising Bitcoin's blockchain the banks are unknowingly consuming a fatal dose of a powerful laxative that Satoshi Nakamoto designed specifically for them.
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:26:55


This was always going to happen. The initial (2013) expectation of low fees forever was misinformed.
Consider that Bitcoin is the flagship of robust security. Its security gives it the quality of censorship-resistance. This design decision necessarily precludes low-fees. So, sacrificing one set of features for others. 
Litecoin effectively is Bitcoin on a smaller, less secure network; making it more suitable for low value transactions. Yet, we can do those with Bitcoin, but via the pending Layer 2 protocols like Lightning. Lightning will allow remittance providers to proliferate, because of low fees on the Lightning Network, but direct on-chain Bitcoin transactions will, by necessity, remain expensive, and probably double and triple in future.

Bitcoin solves the problem of counterfeit and double-spending, for sure.
Yet, if we consider the fiat currency crisis we see that the failure is due to central banking. Society allowed it to happen. It was inevitable all along. The lesson is not to trust third party authorities. Bitcoin solves that too.
If we acknowledge that a large portion of the world's population will not be able to use Bitcoin for years (or decades) to come, and that paper money works fairly well as a value token for them, then it remains to eliminate the central bank control of that money.
While paper money will never have the many features and benefits of Bitcoin, paper money backed by physical assets (such as precious metal or bitcoin) is no longer *fiat currency* and can serve a useful purpose.

I believe you're under-estimating the brainpower that goes into cryptography. We're talking about provable mathematical trapdoors that are researched and proven one-way operations.
I just generated this hex58 notation random number using the same ECC library used by Core:
(first, it generates a random large integer in the quindecillion range (10^48 !), and then converts to hex58 notation with a Bitcoin prefix)
From this random privkey, a pubkey is found on the curve, and then an address is generated by a few hashing and ripemd operations.
You can use any method or any best-effort variation on the code and your hardware will be busy for at least 2 billion years trying to get back at this random number from the address. 
So, the random number generator should have a lot of entropy but it is difficult to be *certain*, as you say, hence the additional steps to obfuscate the pubkey.

Andreas Antonopoulos's metaphor of the Lion and the Shark seems relevant here:
Both Lion and Shark are apex predators in their respective environments, but they cannot compete in each others' environments, nor are they a threat to each other.
Bitcoin has certain design features that preclude others. It cannot be all things to all people, nor is there a design plan that enables it to meet the use cases of all altcoins.
Bitcoin is secure and robust and small blocks is a necessary constraint of that design decision. 
Almost unlimited daily txns, near-instant and with cheap fees **is** possible with Bitcoin but only via layer 2 protocols. Hence, SegWit, Lightning, etc

As I understand it, you support the UAHF, and Jihan's faction, right? He's definitely not acting in his own capacity, or as Bitmain, but *on behalf* of many stakeholders.
I did notice the Future Roadmap and that it is basically the Core roadmap with bigger blocks. Any bystander, regardless of their positioning re the scaling debate, can only interpret the statement and roadmap released by Bitmain, today, as an overt attempt to usurp Bitcoin from the Core developers and from the *so perceived* claws of Blockstream. They're saying they have Big Block community and an economic mandate for this.
OK, fair enough.
What I am saying, and have maintained since i researched this matter in 2015, is that increasing blocksize is a crucial error. The thinking that increased blocksize will cause fees to go down, in the long-run, is flawed because of the Law of Induced Demand.
Initially fees will appear to subside, but as more and more demand fills the available blocksize supply, tx volume will continually rise and fees with it, as bigger and bigger blocks get full. Its a path of diminishing returns.
I'm OK with it, given the objective conditions of irreconcilable difference and demonization, but a multitude of studies reliably predict what will happen with the Big Block chain in the end. 
The only party that stands to gain from this debacle is Jihan Wu and Bitmain.
I have no investment or empathy in this regard. As people say in my village: "May they be gifted with what they deserve".

You're concerned about choice, and nowhere does layered scaling prohibit anyone from choosing whether they want to transact bitcoin via one of the protocol layers, or directly on the mainchain. 
Protocol layers are nothing new. The exchanges typically operate a SQL layer, internally, which they settle to Bitcoin mainchain periodically. See my description in [this comment](
SegWit implements optimizations that generally lower tx fees and facilitate protocol layers - its up to each user if they want to transact on those protocols or not. The free choice remains as before.

I appreciate your point that some people have had their expectations and vision for Bitcoin disappointed.
I would not rub their faces in it, but I would point out that Bitcoin is dynamic. It is not an old-boys club with proof of stake. It must evolve to protect its security - as a primary concern - and fee rates are up to the market.
I have interaction with some early adopters and many of them are pleased with Bitcoin and its future direction under the stewardship of the core developers. Just saying.

I believe we agree on every point we're discussing.
Ideologically, I support Core and although I would prefer no blocksize increase (for the sake of security) I am willing to concede the somewhat aggressive  doubling to 2MB for the sake of Layer 2 requirements.
While I most definitely don't wish bad things on you, a reasonable fellow-Bitcoiner and conversationalist, I do believe the research that implies capacity increase will only lead to more congestion down the line.

timely advice 
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:18:00
Last point first:
As a beginner you don't want to invest a lot, specifically because:
Learning to trade is a long road. The trading legends always say that "the market rewards discipline" and it punishes lack thereof.
The way we learn trading is from our mistakes in the market. Of course, since there is money on the line, when we make a mistake in the market it costs us money!
So, as a beginner, you can pretty much be assured that whatever money you put in the market, you will lose it all along the path of learning. 
The trick is to put only a small amount of money in the market, say $100. Every time you lose, don't increase your stakes, only ever risk a maximum of $100.
Once you can double that $100, then withdraw the profits and try to double $100 again. Once you can do this repeatedly you have become a successful trader. It should take 2 to 5 years. No jokes.
You need to learn different trading methods and find the one that suits you best. You need to learn money management in the market. You need to develop a risk management strategy. You need to find trading rules that apply to you and your psychology. Its a tough road and some people say it is lonely and soul destroying. In the end, you'll be dispassionately executing trades once in a while. Some people say a trading bot can do that. Experienced traders know that a trading bot cannot beat the market because it does not discriminate nuance and context like the human mind can.
You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin for $20 or $100 (max). You do not need big starting capital - especially when you're learning.
Check 
Learn the ropes. Forex trading is a good foundation for commodity trading. But commodities trade very differently from currencies and stocks because their price chart advances, not on hope, but on fear.
Edit: Since you're interested in stocks and penny stocks... my advice is to stay away from large company stocks at this juncture of history. If you are still interested, find penny stocks of companies that will make money during a recession. Research what kind of companies did well during the 1840s and the 1930s. Apply that to the modern context - we're currently in a recession, and the bottom is about to drop out...
Good luck!

The article *only* states:


Are you telling me that from the above statement you extracted all of this implied meaning?:






As for this one:


Who's "we"? I didn't create state. I and everyone I know was never consulted. Are we even talking about the same thing? I use Max Weber's definition:


The state has a constitution (to define national relations and protect citizens), a jurisprudence (The Law, but most who encounter the Constitutional Court, report that it, in fact, enforces on behalf of the banks), cabinet/senate of politicians who ideally represent the people, but are in reality an interface for big business to payroll favorable legislation for their profit. Every state has a central bank - a private corporation that issues the state's currency and reports to the state but who determine the economic and monetary policy of the state. And so on.
Bitcoin was not created for, and is not in service of, this state. Everything Bitcoin was designed for, and can do, is in direct opposition to the interests of the state and threatens the authority of the state's central bank.
War on the state is extreme and a last resort. Its easier to undermine the state, expose the state, frustrate the state, erode and obstruct its ability to exercise central control. Bitcoin is an excellent tool for this purpose.


Bitcoin allows every citizen an escape from the clutches of the central bank. Bitcoin is a political tool. It is fundamentally anti-state. That's why some people get irate when sleep-walkers demand big blocks for cheap fees so they can buy coffee and other inconsequentials with Bitcoin.
Remember, Bitcoin was not invented or legitimized by Gavin Andresen, or Mike Hearn, or Roger Ver, or any of these "I was first" populists and [Cargo Cult]( priests. 
Bitcoin comes out of the Cypherpunk movement, was designed by Cypherpunks and set loose on the world by them. It's irreversibility, censorship-resistance and immutability was chosen specifically to make it a permanent feature of the world - *for the purpose of Cypherpunk objectives*.
[A Cypherpunk's Manifesto](
Since the state seeks to conduct surveillance on its citizens, to make privacy impossible, and to outlaw cryptography. The Cypherpunks demand a right to privacy - for every citizen - and insist on increasing privacy and the use of encryption in full view of the state. Sound familiar?
I say it again: Bitcoin is anti-state.

Your interpretation of what he is saying seems incorrect: he is not saying this is a design goal, or desirable, for Bitcoin. Adam Back is making public conjecture about what fees people might be willing to pay. He obviously expects feedback on the numbers, being a reasonable and interactive man.
As per Bitcoin's design no-one determines fee market rates - its open economy - determined by demand for scarce blockspace
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:06:02
All good points, and objectively stated. I agree that we cannot truly know exactly what Satoshi's vision and degree of foresight was. As much as it would be "too cold" to disregard his views and cypherpunk motivations; it is "too hot" to take his every word and assumption as perfect gospel truth. 
As you mention, the idea of using IP addresses as wallet addresses makes sense only until one learns that IP addresses can be spoofed. Not foreseeing the direction mining would take and, evidently, being unaware of the phenomenon of induced demand does not mean he is telling us: "don't bring those things into your reckoning either", but a clear prompt that we should think for ourselves - in *the spirit of Satoshi*.
Interesting note: the white paper points to Adam Back as the inventor of proof of work - Satoshi smartly adapted it to Bitcoin.
I agree, Satoshi is perhaps the greatest modern inventor. We don't know his exact views on everything, and we can only interpret many of the views he did express directly. What we do know is that Satoshi was pursuing the ideals expressed in the Cypherpunk Manifesto. We must take Bitcoin forward - not by literally implementing his every statement (that contained both understanding *and* oversight), but according to Satoshi's ideals.
Not too hot and not too cold - somewhere in the middle would be about right.

Frustration directed at the code maintainers is misdirected.
Why? Because they have no control over market price. They have not changed anything in code that has weakened the Core client. The Core client is, essentially, unchanged -  the same as it was during the rally advance.
What has changed is that investors and stakeholders are expressing their uncertainty about the upcoming changes. This is typical market behavior and within a few weeks it will change again.
If the NYA capitulate their scheduled Oct/Nov hard fork to 2MB blocks, then there will be a fork and everyone holding legacy bitcoin will also hold duplicate tokens on the new corporate chain.

, when I began interacting with the core devs in order to do peer review of the code and add my efforts to development of Bitcoin, I discovered that the issue of blocksize is complex. More complex than I thought. When I first arrived I was a believer in increasing blocksize because, obviously, blocks were on their way to getting full.
With time, and lots of discussion, I began to understand everything documented in the article linked in the post above. It will be tedious to repeat it all here, so it would be great if you could read it. In a nutshell: due to its design, Bitcoin does not scale effectively.
Bitcoin is designed to be secure and immutable. These are primary design decisions and they have implications:
1. during the necessary adoption period blocksize was not an issue
2. the Bitcoin innovation addresses a critical need and demand for it will continue to increase exponentially - this is testament to its innovation and success
3. massive demand means blocks were eventually going to get full
All of the core devs I spoke to over the years have acknowledged this: blocks were going to get full. "Well, why not increase blocksize then?" I asked? Came the answer from SegWit developer Pieter Wuille: "Because of the Law of Induced Demand". I didn't know what this was, so had to go do some research and found out that in large scale networks - as a rule - *increased capacity is rapidly filled by demand*.
Ongoing and massive future demand means that there is no reasonable blocksize that will not be quickly filled to capacity. This is illustrated by almost a century of research. Hence, blocksize is the wrong parameter to tweak, if we seek to scale Bitcoin.
The correct approach, as supported by research data and CS, is to add additional protocol network layers for various popular use-cases. For example, instead of widening a congested major roadway, a subsidized transit or public bus system can be implemented on the existing infrastructure - moving more people per vehicle space, instead of every person driving solo in their personal vehicle.
The protocol layer approach means that each layer can have its unique features and retain its core characteristics: Bitcoin can remain secure and robust, Layer 2 (e.g. Lightning) can be faster and cheaper for use-cases such as micro-transactions and remittance, Layer 3 can be a reference network with human interaction and verification, etc ... i made up that last layer 3! :)
In this way, when your 1BTC is worth $3000 or $10,000 you can move it to secure storage via a direct on-chain transaction because you are willing to wait 2 days and pay the $10 or $100 fee for the benefit of Bitcoin's robust security. If you want to pay a bill or buy something for $5, then you can do that almost-instantly via LN (or any other Layer 2 network) for a negligible fee.
I thought I knew better, but hundreds of hours in conversation with the devs, over a year, eventually brought me to *the understanding they already had*. I was persistent and they were graciously patient but, obviously, they do not have the time or inclination to explain their CS knowledge and insights to every layman, one-by-one. By now I trust the core devs with critical design decisions because I don't have a year to learn the rudiments of each issue I don't understand, but which they do.
The core devs should and do remain subject to peer review, and they welcome anyone to participate and contribute in this healthy Open Source practice.
 , would agree, I am sure, because sometimes we think we know, but as non-specialists we might be completely unaware of *what it is we don't know*

The implication is that Satoshi Nakamoto referenced, and agreed with, the definition of money given by Nick Szabo.
This gives Nick Szabo's definition credence in relation to Bitcoin's monetary function, as long as we avoid making him an authority. Bitcoin development must always go toward where it renders Bitcoin most secure, not necessarily toward the embodiment of perfect money.
Two nitpicks with this article:


False. Bitcoin has an undeniable political character given its origins from the cypherpunk movement. It has censorship-resistance as a primary feature precisely because it is a political weapon against the state.


So where is the cut-off date that distinguishes early adopters from mid-term adopters and late adopters? No one can say, but objectively, there are early adopters who were closer to Satoshi and his ideology, and there are early adopters who opportunistically jumped on-board once they heard the term "money" and saw an exchange price. Qualitatively different motivations and ideologically non-similar in many cases.
It reminds of the time Mike Hearn started demanding a right to say-so in the Bitcoin developers list because he and Gavin Andresen "were first". Despite being assigned developer roles by Satoshi himself, it later became clear that these two characters had a VISA vision for Bitcoin that was incompatible with the consensus vision shared  by the core devs and contributors.
Assuming seniority and demanding say-so based on early developer or adopter status is ludicrous in Bitcoin land.  Consensus Rule does not care about how early you took the risk, how loud your voice or how willful your personality.
Bitcoin's golden rule is Rule by Consensus, not Rule by Proof-of-Stake

Right, so anonymous cash is eliminated in favor of centralized cryptocurrency - every transaction tied to your identity.


So, if their blockchain can just be hardforked whenever they see fit - with no public consensus - that's better than what they're doing already anyhow? Just because its on a blockchain? If you notice it happening, and you have no means of enforcing consensus, what's the difference to you or anyone? Right now, they announce monetary policy changes - outright, in the public media - and no-one can do anything but watch their fiat get devalued. Same difference.
You're saying you can accept that because its on a blockchain, now, with full survellance of your every transaction?

The govt agencies are more active and vigilant on Tor than on cleartext internet. Hence, when you connect via Tor it serves to fool the "other side" - not govt.
With Tor, there is some probability that you are not connecting to a govt run Tor relay, and then your objective is security by obscurity - by appearing as similar to all other user agents as possible.
Any connection to a 3rd party - whether via Tor or cleartext - is a risk, as you explain. 
If maximum security and privacy is your concern then connect to your own Electrum server via Tor.
Even better, trust only your own fullnode that connects to the network via Tor.

I like this analogy. Yes, it may be over-simplified, but it is a highly useful tool for discussing scaling and the supply/demand dynamics of Bitcoin - away from Bitcoin - which bypasses assumption and emotion.
A small point of correction: UASF (BIP148) is an aggressive tactic to twist miners' arms into signalling SegWit. The original (Core) SegWit activation code is already baked into the protocol, so after requisite signaling, SegWit will only activate a year later. So, BIP148 does not rush SegWit, but it bypasses Consensus rule, by forcing a decision to signal SegWit.
Your analogy lays bare, with a real world example, a picture of the network. It also matches the Law of Induced Demand that applies to public roadways, healthcare and, to a large extent, the Bitcoin network.
Great stuff, !

You'll be getting all kinds of opinions here and, of course, take them with a grain of salt - always act according to what you have established for yourself!
That said, take it from a salty dog: creation, life, human psychology - and, therefore, markets - express in Fibonacci ratios. The ratio 0.5 (half) does feature, but the ratio 2 (double) seldom does. You're looking for ratios that end in .382 and .618, like 1.618 or 4.618.
Bitcoin rallies, similar to most commodity rallies, seem to extend to Fibonacci series numbers: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 54, ...

Difficult to find definitive figures, but here's a further pipe-and-smoke-it:
The linked illustration quotes global money supply to be $84tril (or $31tril, unclear).
[This diagram]( states total global debt to be ~$60tril.
[This older article]( puts global debt at $223tril - and presumably global credit has not decreased since 2013.
```money supply = cash in circulation + credit (debt)```
So, global (cenbank fiat) money supply is somewhere between $80tril - $280tril. 
Probably, the exact figure is unimportant because tens of trillions is *a lot* - more than the human mind can manipulate. The fact that **the bulk of global money supply is credit** means that credit collapse (deflation of the credit bubble) could quickly halve global money supply.
According to the definition of money supply, above, when credit vanishes from the equation, value flows to the cash in circulation. Smoke it...

While the opinion of Bitcoin business stakeholders is important, it is not the decider for Bitcoin change management. Consensus is, and there is no consensus for any of the solutions out there. Hence, consensus rule dictates that we should not force roadmaps and changes down each other's throats while each faction prostitutes Bitcoin's consensus principle for economic or ego benefit.
SegWit2x is a poor solution because it a) is a hard fork, and b) makes a concession to Bitmain to continue using ASICboost (no proof that they are, in fact, doing this but *the concession is significant*). ASICboost is an unfair mining advantage that is not compatible with Bitcoin consensus and effectively increases mining centralization. A security compromise that is unacceptable.

The article draws together several sources around the topic of global economic slow-down. It makes the case that cryptocurrencies with their phenomenal price growth and, hence, willing investors could contribute to drivers of future growth.
There could be some truth in this, but not in the linear manner the article suggests. 
Firstly, as the Socionomics Institute convincingly argues: economic slowdown is not an ailment, it is the natural successor of economic growth! Any thing that grows must also have a cyclical period of stasis (rest). Whether that is a cell, a plant, the Sun, or a human endevour like the world economy.  Think of what happens when you don't sleep for 3 days.
The past 40 years have seen repeated artificial resuscitation of the global economy's efforts to contract and rest. Relentless growth has been achieved with fiat and its easy translation to almost free credit. 
Well its a principle of economics that nothing is for free - every transaction and decision has a cost. At some point, the global credit bubble of hundreds of trillions of dollars will exact its price, deflate and then the global economy can contract and rest. Only when it has done contracting and cooling can it grow again.
The article quotes a G30 report:


It is here where the keen crypto investors and their bitcoin spending power is being referenced (by the article writer - not by the G30).
That would be nice, but real cryptocurrency (as opposed to centralized ETH or cenbank crypto-fiat) does not facilitate the creation of credit - which has been the growth driver until now.
Bitcoin wealth, just like fiat wealth, invested in national and transnational projects remains vulnerable to a) project failure, b) a global deflationary episode.

You raise a very good point. Which is probably why many Bitcoiners are feeling low at this time. If Bitcoin is torn apart from inside and 
 consensus rule is abandoned then the censorship resistance has no foundation. Probably a fork into two ideological camps: Big-Block-Big-Adoption and Security-and-Censorship-Resistance chains.

I hear your concerns, but dedicated targeted attack is unrelated to random number generation via algorithm.
Intel might be co-opted, so we use AMD, then AMD becomes compromised and we use ARM, but no, ARM is owned by company xyz who owe the US data for the next 10 years based on some trade agreement...
It just becomes madness at some level. If you believe your CPU is reporting its every clock cycle to govt agencies, then you might as well throw in the towel right now. 
Fact is, if I generate a random number via algorithm it results in a unique Bitcoin address. And Bitcoin has been secure until now. So, I will continue to use Bitcoin and trust that its elliptic curve cryptography is secure - because a mathematical trapdoor is just that: easy to generate, almost impossible to reverse. 
If govt has the resources to receive every key being produced via compromised CPUs then, clearly, we're fucked and hope to die. Yet, there is no evidence to support this view.

Exactly the paragraph I had copied to quote before I came to this comments page.
The author makes the assertion that miners pay for keeping Bitcoin running. Woe, the poor souls for earning the world's most value commodity in the process!
At the very last paragraph he mentions *consumers*... Ultimately, when the free punch is gone, Bitcoin users will fund the miners and their symbiosis must sustain the network.
Confront most people (even a PhD) with real-world economics and they start regurgitating the same theoretical nonsense being used by "economists" and the central banks to steer the economy into a thick veil of fog.
Sometimes I think that eyes wide open on Bitcoin is worth more than 100 years of mainstream economics.

It has always been my understanding that without the SW fix for TM, LN was not possible. I would appreciate a reference to Poon's words because if LN does not need SW, then what has the wait and SW-hype been all about! :)


Eh? You gotta explain what "market equilibrium" is. And how a technical parameter can equilibrate markets. A clarification would be useful.


For a few days - at most a few months - but latent demand will quickly fill the new capacity, leading to the same congestion and same high fees. This is the dynamic of supply-and-demand in large public networks, as described by the principle of Induced Demand.


I'm not saying less, I'm saying a rational miner would want bigger blocks because that means more transactions at higher fees, as per Induced Demand.


Smaller miners, yes. Largest miners (most hash rate), no. It is evident in the economy and in history that those who dominate an industry are not in favor of leveling the playing field, for obvious reasons. 
You do explain why miners would want more decentralization:


In principle, I agree that they reasonably should. However, a large proportion of the people who are currently in Bitcoin, and of those who are pouring in - very few people comprehend Bitcoin's fundamental values such as censorship resistance and decentralization.
I argue that people won't act rationally and abandon a centralized Bitcoin. Bitcoin is centralized to Antpool and Bitmain right now, yet we are not leaving. Adoption is growing fast.
Centralized cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are a case in point.

There are no design or development guarantees of ease-of-use or anonymity.
In the cryptocurrency space Bitcoin is the flagship for security and robustness, so a lot of usability and speed is sacrificed for these characteristics.
At its heart Bitcoin is slow, unreliable and expensive. Many articles and users misrepresent it as otherwise.
Even as a firm believer and long time user of Bitcoin, I use Litecoin if I want a fast, cheap transaction. Bitcoin has certain strengths and other cryptocurrencies have other different uses and features.
Buying Bitcoin you have to be careful. Don't buy from a service that applies KYC - that links your identity with Bitcoin and with the exchange address - Govt will use that against you eventually. Use localbitcoins.com instead.

As [Greg Maxwell points out]( the reaction of most devs to Silbert's hare-brained SegWit2x proposal has been "LOL".
The applicability of [Induced Demand]( when scaling large public networks with high demand is a factor. There is no evidence that Silbert, Ver, Wu &amp; Co. understand this principle - mainly because none of them have ever mentioned it as a major (or perhaps unimportant) dynamic. 
Their knowledge (as a group or as individuals) of Induced Demand and their intentional/unintentional failure to acknowledge it - that is a matter for conjecture. Nonetheless, according to the principle of Induced Demand, larger blocks will lead to more congestion and even higher fees - and quickly.
You may be familiar with the smart money maxim: "Buy the rumor, sell the fact". We can see this attitude play out in the market each time price is speculated higher on the *anticipation of an event* and sells off at its actual occurrence. We cannot predict trend based on the maxim alone, but certainly the prospect of token-doubling for all BTC holders will provide an incentive.
Alternatively, in support of your point, the prospect of each chain's price halving sympathetically, at the split, could provide both a shorting opportunity and an opportunity to buy tokens cheaper - an opportunity "smart money" would not love to miss!

I have a different wording but essentially agree on the outcome:
Miners know what is good for Bitcoin in the long-term, but act on what suits their pocket over the short-term.
They are not to blame - economically, they must act rationally. It's up to users to enforce the moral imperative. As Eric Lombrozo and a thousand discussions confirm: The developers should defer to users, where possible, on fundamental protocol issues. Miners are beholden to their need to make profit  (or just make ends meet).

OS level random number generation has always been considered weak. Android, despite the mighty Google, is no exception.
This is why I am saying you're underestimating the brain-trust among core developers. They have been mitigating against this weakness for several years.
Perhaps I am misunderstanding the urgency of what you are saying and you are, in fact, onto something. Here's how Bitcoin's open source development model allows you to address this vulnerability:
- fork the Bitcoin source code via GitHub
- find the weak code
- improve it
- submit it for peer review
- if there is consensus among the 100+ people that regularly contribute then Wladimir will merge your improvement into the code of the next release

Bitmain currently maintains Antpool which represents around 24% of network hashrate. That figure is a concern but not a major security weakness, yet.
Antpool is a mining pool, meaning that miners from all around the world point their mining gear at it and mine for blocks together. The pool has diverse membership and is not *all* a single entity, namely Bitmain.
The only thing we can know for sure is that everything always changes. Like investment companies tell clients in the small print: past trends do not necessarily project into the future.
For example material conditions are changing already: Bitmain's growth is being constrained by the 1MB block size limit. No matter, how much the network is spammed and no matter how desperate users are to get their tx confirmed in the next block, the fee market does not chase to the heights some miners need to turn the profits they seek.
Meanwhile the block reward halves every 4 years and Bitcoin Core and the majority of bitcoin holders/users remain reluctant to increase block size. IMO, that's why guys like Jihan Wu and Roger Ver are acting hysterical and lashing out in anger - they are super stressed because they are not making the money their business plans projected. Perhaps they're even losing money with their mining operations. All because of the Core devs and users wanting this silly "censorship-resistance" and a baby-steps development process.
The parasitic Bitcoin businesses need more txns and the highly competitive miners need more fees. How? Increase block size: more transactions, same congestion due to massive latent demand for Bitcoin block space, same high fees - but multiplied by more txns equals massive profits! 
And then Bitcoin Core and users reach consensus on layered scaling. No block size increase needed. Shift the bulk of micro-transactions to a different protocol layer with no mining. Hence, less transactions on main chain and subsequently less fees. Aargh!
Messed up the Bitcoin businesses' and miners' whole game - their long-term business plans suddenly show red for the future and have to be redrawn.
So, first they tried to take over Bitcoin. But they didn't know the strength of conviction that the cypherpunks have - it was never going to happen. Now that they've come to accept they cannot have Bitcoin, they did NYA to implement their strategy to fork to 2MB blocks. Jihan Wu, can't even pay the bills with 2MB blocks. He's going straight to 8MB block with his planned fork BitcoinABC!
The above is all conjecture and my personal interpretation of what's happening out of sight. But you see that a censorship-resistant Bitcoin is not profitable for Bitmain. They're leaving and taking the majority of their hashrate with them.

Well, Bitcoin is complex. I argue that few know all of it, and that no-one truly understands it, or its implications.
On the one hand there is the tech: a mashup of BitTorrent, pubprivkey cryptography and a cumbersome distributed database.
On the other hand we have concepts like Consensus, Decentralization, Censorship-resistance, etc. new things that are inforced and required by the new tech. Most people have never been governed by Consensus, so its a tough one to bend one's head around.
Then mixed in with all of this is the token: money, commodity, smart contract. 
All of it dropped in the world at the height of a 40 year credit bubble. Most people, including economists, have no clue how economy works - not because they're stupid, but because the field is highly propagandized and society is mis-educated by design.
So there are some things I don't understand clearly or fully, just like you.
But I don't buy the story that Blockstream is a Zionist plot to capture Bitcoin. Layers 2 and 3 are open source protocols and anyone can run their own LN node or even deploy their own Layer 2/3 network. It has no central beneficiary or back doors. Anyone can review the code. There are several (unrelated) Layer 2 networks deploying in west and across southern and east Africa. Just a bunch of clever guys using the protocol for BTC remittance...

Satoshi coded most of the design specifications in what is called the "Satoshi Reference Client", the open source code base that is still being developed by the Core team.
I believe its more helpful to look at the actual implementation and code rather than infer what it means from the whitepaper.
For example, 1) and 2) require that you understand how mining is implemented, which requires that you understand the Proof-of-Work algorithm and see an example of SHA256 hashing and its big-endian representation that is referred to by those "0" bits.
The book Mastering Bitcoin explains all that, and gives examples, that will make everything fall in place. Most of your questions will be answered by reading chapters 2 and 6.

Most people are *not* opposed to Lightning Network. But many groups have different reasons for delaying its implementation via SegWit.
From a rational miner's point of view, higher fees are preferable because they represent more income per block mined.
Lightning Network promises lower fees - *for individual micro-transactions conducted over LN*. 
Moving micro-transactions to LN means latent demand for on-chain Bitcoin txns can send one-off larger txns *on-chain*, thereby, hiking fees up again. 
So LN network fees will be low, but Bitcoin on-chain txn costs will soon return to the prevailing median fee rate .
From a miner's perspective, LN reduces the fees for the large proportion of micro-transactions out there. That kinda sucks for your mining profit because you lose fee income. That's why any "rational" miner would strategically delay SegWit (because LN needs SegWit to function).
From a Bitcoin business stakeholder's perspective, LN is a bitter-sweet prospect:
On the one hand, if your market falls in the micro-transaction category, then you now have to implement this LN thing. More staff, more headaches, more expenses.
On the other hand, because SegWit activation promises more efficient block space utilization, it reduces the urgency and panicked rhetoric for a block size increase. This might be a reason to delay, and perhaps oppose SegWit. Why?
Because large txn Bitcoin businesses want a block size increase so bad that they're almost peeing in their pants. Bigger blocks will rapidly soak up latent demand for Bitcoin and increase the network's txn throughput dramatically. This means more users, more business and more profit. 
The narrative that a blocksize increase reduces congestion and, therefore, reduces fees is very clever. Initially, the additional capacity does reduce congestion and fees. As latent demand starts flowing into the additional capacity, so the congestion returns and the fees go up again.
The devious explanation to a naive audience will be: "You see, Core was keeping all of this demand out of Bitcoin all these years! If we had increased blocksize 2 years ago then we wouldn't be having these problems!"
If the narrative can be sustained - that another blocksize increase will normalize congestion and fees - then the businesses and miners have it made. A path to ever increasing blocksize, an unending influx of users, cyclical congestion and fee crises, and stupendous profit.
Meanwhile, though lucrative for some, that blockchain will be totally insecure, centralized to those wealthy business interest and mining monopolies/cartels. There will be no meaningful consensus rule or censorship resistance in such a chain.
Bitcoin would have transformed from a decentralized peoples' money, to a corporate finance payment network run by a few mining operators who will have absolute control over the network, its history and destiny.
That's it. Apparently, I got it all figured out.

Thanks for the compliment. As you say: it takes one to know one (in the diversity of intellects present at reddit)
What I explain in the last paragraph of my previous post is counter intuitive. Our minds tell us that whatever happens in the price chart must have a cause - some event that triggered it, or unknown effect that resulted in a price move. We then look for contiguous events and explanations and the media are the beloved "reporters" of the cause-effect confirmation. Yet, media reports are mostly written by journalists who are clueless about true market dynamics and who connect unrelated dots and pander to majority consensus. 
Market reality is both simpler and stranger than commonly understood. If you take time to verify large market moves and their alleged (reported or commonly believed) cause, you will find that the market consistently moves in the eventual direction **before** the supposedly causal event.
For example, it is popular knowledge that bitcoin price crashed from the November 2013 alltime high when China announced regulation. However, the market topped and began decline almost 3 days before China announced restrictions on Bitcoin trade! So its a popular myth then. This misallocation of cause is well documented at [Socionomics.net](
To answer your question, the largest players need to herd market participants into large moves over long periods of time (weeks/months) because they need time to build their sizable positions worth 10s and 100s of $mil and they also need to then systematically close those positions without crashing the market or ruining their trades.
If you study the 1-day chart with this perspective in mind then their actions become evident. Sudden market swings are not "whale" action - it is in their interest to be as unobtrusive and invisible as possible. That is why it is often remarked that large players "massage" the market into trends.
My language is perhaps unclear on that point about gentle whales eating plankton... i mean to say that one cannot truthfully call the largest players in a market "gentle whales" since they are its largest predators who eat everything below it in the foodchain, hence *killer whale* (orca) is a more appropriate characterization.

The article does not contain anything conclusive but some interesting facts that were corroborated by both Wired and Gizmodo:
CW had claimed in interviews with Gizmodo and Wired that David Kleiman was a partner in Bitcoin. The Gizmodo article explores Kleiman's personal life, computer security knowledge and some unconvincing evidence that he was holding a fortune.
There is some possible overlap in his and Satoshi's online activity:

You'll see these speculative rallies and extended corrections in all commodity charts. Basically, what goes up will come down. A period of buying is followed by a period of selling. Expansion and contraction. Growth and decay. Breathe in then breathe out.
You can visualize a mean line of growth that goes from zero on the left of the chart, through ~500 in the middle and 1000 at the right of the chart.
Mean Reversion theory asserts that price will tend to swing around this mean trajectory. Rising high above it during rallies and then returning to the mean during profit-taking phases. However, whereas rallies occur during phases of positive social mood, market-wide sell-offs continue through phases of negative social mood where price tends to swing too far below the mean price and down to the bedrock of the next advancing phase.
Throughout that large bear-market from end 2013 to beginning 2015, Bitcoin was fundamentally no different from what it was during the 2013 run-up. It was the market's mood toward it that changed and negative social mood leads to selling behavior.

If Bob lends Alice 1BTC, they can enter an agreement that she pays him back after one month with 10% interest.
So she borrows 1BTC now and Bob expects 1.1BTC repayment at expiry of the loan.
Whatever Alice does with the 1BTC (she's going to put it to productive use, right?), she has to put 0.1BTC of her profits aside for the premium she owes to Bob for the benefit of using his money temporarily.
Lending creates credit (or debt, depending on whose perspective you take) and it inflates money supply, because Bob holds a credit bill for 1BTC (originally belonging to him) and Alice holds 1BTC (borrowed from Bob). So, where as the loaned 1BTC is only accounted for once on the blockchain, in the economy there are now two. Read this paragraph again - credit is potentially treacherous to the economy (this example also illustrates the basis for what we call "money printing")
There are two types of loans:
- productive
- unproductive
Taking out a loan to buy an economy vehicle to commute to work is considered a productive loan because it aids in generating the income that repays the loan (and the premium on the loan)
Buying a bigger TV for your home on credit is considered an unproductive loan, because the expense does not generate value in the economy. Some argue that consumer goods and luxury vehicles do, in fact,  add value because they create jobs at factory. However, from a militant perspective the expense is wasteful because, considering it is paid for with debt, the item's higher cost does not, of itself, aid in generating the premium - it merely satisfies ego ambitions of status and ostentatious ownership. A smaller TV and less expensive vehicle would fulfill the same material *function*.
Productive loans (with interest) benefit society and the economy. Unproductive loans burden the economy because they add no value after purchase and are easily and frequently defaulted on. If Alice were to default on the loan, then whatever she spent the 1BTC on would still be accounted for in the blockchain, but in the economy the value of 2BTC plus the agreed premium of 0.1BTC would be destroyed. This is why, contrary to popular belief, bitcoin does not eliminate credit or fractional reserve lending, because *people* choose to *accept* fractional loans (i.e. a 0.8BTC loan, given to Bob, using as collateral his bill of debt for 1.1BTC)
Interest is in the agreement between two parties, not in the underlying financial vehicle, whether commodity goods, fiat or bitcoin. For example, Alice can lend Bob two goats for a month and they might agree on interest of a block of feta - no fractional reserve or inflation is needed for the agreement to work.

Bitcoin is a cypherpunk gift to the technologically enabled urban population to challenge the state and its pay-roller the central bank. Not to burden some "third-world" laborer with banking and an expensive, cumbersome blockchain that relies on electricity and dear cellphones and a data-plan to function - in areas of the globe with already intermittent electricity supply and connectivity.
The assumptions of the question (dilemma) are absurd, so there is no reasonable answer.
Even if Bitcoin was useful to 7bil people, the grass-roots evidence is that the majority of the globe's population haven't heard of Bitcoin and when they do, it has no relevance to or utility for their predominantly rural lives.
The village markets and weekly fiat wages that fuel the economic existence of the global majority, removes Bitcoin as a viable solution, now, and for many decades to come.
Granted, the over-simplistic and naive dilemma is born of the mindset that increasing blocksize will increase transaction throughput and reduce fees.

If the one side breaks consensus, then it will set a precedent  for that camp for eternity. They will split into smaller and smaller factions - each time based on some reactionary non-scientific reason.
The breach will strengthen resolve in the pro-censorship-resistance (CR) camp to adhere to consensus rule ever after.
It will mean, however, that the CR fork will be less active, have lower priced tokens, and be out of the public eye for many years - until its censorship resistance and high security is called for by exceptional circumstances.
The Big Block chain will be contentious, torn apart by internal strife (consensus rule having been thrown out the window), but it will be popular with those who confuse price with value, and be the business token of choice. With time this big adoption (BA) chain will most likely find itself in direct competition with cenbank crypto fiat - equally centralized, just as meaningless.
However, it places a moral imperative on those who value censorship resistance, security and the right to privacy, to adhere to consensus rule absolutely.

I think you're misunderstanding the ASIC manufacturing scene.
In electronic engineering, many people make ASICs everyday for dedicated processing tasks.
For Bitcoin hashing purposes, many companies such as BitFury, Dragon, etc manufacture ASIC chips - not only Bitmain.
Of course, with China being the world's cheapest location for electronics manufacture it only follows that Chinese manufacturers and miners will take the lead in this field.
If the Chinese state truly seeks to subsidize and encourage Bitcoin mining as a national enterprise and as an international advantage, then its not because they're evil, but because the rest of the world's governments are slow to catch on.
Yet, its not only that the ship of state is slow, but that Bitcoin fundamentally disrupts the state and its payroller, the national central bank. So, it cuts both ways: whichever government most encourages Bitcoin is making itself most vulnerable to it - raising an adversary in its own house, so to speak.
It's all fair and well. Bitcoin is perfectly capable of passing these tests and trials. The challenges are interesting and necessary.

While I am willing to explain this, doing so is tedious. I cannot find the link to a post in which I have already addressed this issue, but when I do find it I will post it here.
In a nutshell, although it seems logical that adoption should drive price higher, we do not see evidence of this phenomenon in the history of markets.
If it were true that adoption drove price then we'd have to conclude that adoption was lower during 2015 than it was during the second half of 2013 when price rallied to above $1000. Yet, this was clearly not the case, so the conclusion must be that adoption and price are not correlated.
So if price was, on average, higher during 2014 than it was during 2015, but adoption and usage (txns/day, number of growing Bitcoin businesses, etc) was higher during 2015, then what, indeed, drives price?
The answer is: Speculation Drives Price.

Drama for sure, and all of it fueled by the fire and excitement in this moment of history. I like your observation about the character of the developer team. I do get the sense that there are some devs with sane moderate temperaments who are just getting on with things in a systematic manner - for example, the guys working on consensus code.
That gives me confidence that there is a calm, rational contingent at the "core", so to speak, because they routinely go through the paces of reviewing code, nit-picking, and throwing out ACKs and NACKs across the evolving code landscape.
I guess that's what we ideally want to see - only more devs of that caliber and fewer rockstars and "interesting" personalities :)
I find this whole thing fascinating - it is rapid evolution and social change right before our eyes. I think many many people in this space still have to come to terms with what Consensus truly means and its implications. But part of a newly formed population's culturing process (learning about and abiding by consensus - both in protocol and in change management), the process will involve some mistakes and blunders. But they will be critical lessons and historical examples.
You're obviously a thinker. Allow me to ask your opinion on a social theory I am tinkering with:
There is, in SE Asia (probably Western Pacific, to be correct), the phenomenon of Cargo Cult among the Melanesians. When the US Military began building its post-WWII bases around the Pacific, the Melanesians had a peculiar reaction to logistics of supply and equipment delivery - apparently out of nowhere, coming from the sky.
It is easy to ascribe their Cargo Cult reaction to island-dweller naivety and incomprehension of technology and transport networks. Yet, as the article (and real life!) illustrates, the phenomenon of Cargo Cultism is not restricted to loin-clothed "primitives"! 
I believe this cultish expectation of miraculous cargo (high price, low fees, poverty eradication) via infrastructure manipulation (mock runways and airports in Melanesia; big blocks in Bitcoin) is happening in the 21st century:

I don't see the dichotomy 


Bitcoin is P2P cash and this definition includes settlement - something the exchanges have been doing for years when they consolidate internal trades and withdrawals in batches.
The distinction is analogous to saying a multi-node road network is either for personal vehicle use or for public transport. Clearly it can, and should, if it is to be useful and economically productive, carry both types of traffic.
I don't see, in the whitepaper, any stipulation against settling cash txns in batches, nor do I see, in Core's SegWit roadmap, anything that prohibits or precludes on-chain cash transactions.
The public road network is a good analogy, because it illustrates the dilemma that engineers have encountered since Roman times, namely the Law of Induced Demand. In a nutshell: as a rule, when we increase capacity in congested areas of a large scale network (whether road network or public health system, etc) the observed outcome is that demand rapidly fills the additional supply.
Here is an arbitrary example: 
There is no reason to believe that Bitcoin is exempt from this economic principle, should we try and solve its congestion by increasing blocksize.
The self-evident solution to congestion seems to be: well, if blocks are full, then increase blocksize! But research and historical example show us that this "intuitive" solution has a surprising outcome: the congestion quickly returns, and in Bitcoin's case, the encumbent high fees.
Hence, trying to scale Bitcoin and lower fees by manipulating blocksize is a futile endevour. Approaching the challenge from different angles, there are other viable paths, and the one that found consensus among core contributors was the multi-layered approach.
An additional dilemma exists, and this is a subtle point: Bitcoin's degree of security is directly related to blocksize. There is too much to discuss when trying to illustrate this point, yet, I believe most people understand the inverse relationship whereby increasing blocksize reduces degree of security and decentralization. I explore this topic in an article I wrote: 
Hence, besides the fact that blocksize manipulation cannot relieve congestion, blocksize creep (upward) involves gradual security degradation.
With a multi-layered approach, there is no compromise to Bitcoin - it retains its fundamental feature of robust security, it remains a cash network and the protocol layers above it settle cash transactions downward.
Even should the folly of "Bitcoin Unlimited" become a manifest reality, the use-case of settlement will remain out there in the world and on the network. 


I don't get this line of reasoning. Perhaps one can consider the whitepaper to be a "sales pitch" rather than a design document. Either way, evolution and change are the time-proven constants. Bitcoin must evolve, primarily to remain secure. So, I don't read "blocksize would have to up" in the whitepaper, in fact, the primary design criterion is censorship resistance, immutability, security. Satoshi would have it no other way. Increasing blocksize would provably degrade security. The only Golden Rule Satoshi left us, was the Rule of Consensus. 
The earliest adopters, the designers and creators of this network, namely the cypherpunks, had baked their ideology into Bitcoin: it is anti-state at its core. Hence, the security requirement is paramount versus a malevolent and better-resourced adversary.
@_date: 2017-06-24 03:53:28
This answer may be the explanation that fits current mining conditions better:
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:40:31
You should read Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper - it presents the dilemmas and how Bitcoin solves them. Those are the rudiments.
Bitcoin was designed in response to central bank control of fiat currency, and their willful devaluation of each holder's money without their permission. Money printing and fractional reserve inflation of credit.
Bitcoin's primary characteristics are security and decentralization. These make it censorship-resistant and immutable.
To achieve its security, certain design decisions had to be made. Some features were therefore sacrificed. As a result Bitcoin is:
- slow (multiple confirmations across a distributed network)
- unreliable (your transaction might not be confirmed if the fees are too low)
- expensive (its resource heavy and mining proof-of-work burns electricity)
After all, Bitcoin is a flagship of security. It cannot be stopped and your bitcoin held in an address can only ever be accessed by you alone, provided you keep the private key secret.
If you want to spend those bitcoin you don't need anyone's permission and you can dissociate yourself from the transaction if you're clever. Hence, its nobody's business but your own that you have transacted. You can set it up that two people have to sign a transaction before the bitcoin are spent, or any two-of-three, or whatever combination. This eliminates the need for a Public Notary. If you extrapolate, many middlemen and 3rd parties are likewise made redundant, their fees, their institutions. Even the bank and the central bank. You starting to see what it means for the world and the future?
The price for all of this is that Bitcoin is expensive. So where there is a need for great security and immutability we use Bitcoin. For less important transactions we can use Litecoin or (soon) the Lightning Network.
Bitcoin is quite a technical innovation. The recommendation made elsewhere - that you should listen to a lot of Antonop talks on Youtube - is a good one.

Eric Lombrozo made a [good point]( recently when he said,


Miners work hard for their money, it is true. Yet, they stand to make generous profits denominated in the world's most valuable commodity if their business plan is sound. They should, reasonably, be asked to signal on issues that affect them. But, as we have learnt on this occasion with SegWit, miners should not *automatically* be asked to make decisions for the network's future - *even in some cases where it directly affects them*.
Miners must work for their daily bread, but as is the case with all owners of the means of production, they should be regarded with healthy suspicion, since they are prone to cartel behavior and vulnerable to bribes from big business and coercion by the state.
That is an objective criticism - I am not promoting disdain for miners based on the attitude or behavior of a renegade few.

It depends what the market majority values most:
- business and miners must rationally care more about profit and therefore the fork that encourages most adoption
- those who care for security and censorship resistance must rationally place most weight on security and decentralization
Many users, especially less-informed new users, don't have a first-principle grasp of the inverse correlation between Bitcoin's network fees and security. Understandably, they will be attracted to the lower cost and more popular chain.
The most popular chain will not necessarily be the most secure chain or the most censorship resistant. Value and price don't often correspond.

If we take an objective position, his statement contains some truth:
There are *some* people willing to pay $100 tx fees for certain types of transactions. 
This is observable in the real world: people are paying fees of more than $100 for wire transfer and physical gold delivery.
Many foreign workers routinely (monthly) pay fees exceeding $125 to send remittances to family in their home countries.
If I had to pay a ransom for my daughter's life I'm willing to pay $1000 to make sure that tx is included in the very next block. Yes, an extreme example, but this use case is plausible, really happens, hence there is an effect on fees.
Adam Back confirms his *conjecture* by saying he would be willing to pay said fee rates.
Many of the transactions that happen on the network, are meant to be out-of-sight of traditional finance and govt eyes, people are willing to pay high fees for that privacy and security - for the service.
There is no telling what use-cases govt will create in future. A high-demand and robustly secure transfer network like Bitcoin was always going to attract high fees, right?

Use of Merkle Tree and Merkle Root as an optimization is implemented. As you can see in the quote from the whitepaper, it reduces the size of the block header since the block does not have to include all of the previous block's transaction data, but only needs to refer to them by their Merkle Root.
Notwithstanding, all *new* transactions that are being confirmed in the current block are included in the block container (note, not in the *header*), so each transaction's contents consume blockspace.
Merkle Tree and Merkle Root seem complicated, but it is actually very easy to understand when explained by James DeAngelo. It is worth watching this video because I guarantee you will "get it" and be a more informed Bitcoin user!
*Edit: James DeAngelo refers to "from address" - a notion that is now considered to be flawed, since your wallet may select bitcoin from various of the wallet's addresses as inputs to a transaction. This does not detract from the great explanation in the video.*

@_date: 2017-06-06 13:51:01
If you mean:


This is just my own conclusion given the facts. Since the early days of the blocksize debate, many personalities were saying that *if blocksize is not increased to meet rising demand then users will stop using it and go elsewhere and Bitcoin will be forgotten in favor of other altcoins*
Well, blocks have been full for over a year, and new users keep flooding in. Price keeps on rallying, and blocksize has not been increased. 
The reason why the developers have not increased blocksize, according to their own position on the matter, is because doing so is a security risk. I agree. 
A nominal increase of 2MB is needed for SegWit and Lightning to work. But this is scheduled for several months in the future.
From my perspective, if the market considered Bitcoin a failure and its network congestion (present and future) to be a bad thing, then excited speculation would not have been driving price higher for the past 2 years until today.
Hence, my opinion that the core devs' decision to honor security before fear of congestion was the right decision and it is expressed by the market in the price chart.

Assuming the economy's level of output of goods and services remained constant, then Bitcoin supply would have deflated in relation to the available goods and services in the economy.
However, we know that it can go the other way - that the economy may have shrunk - in which case Bitcoin would be somewhat more inflated than it was during a previous productive, high-output phase. Hence, my statement that it won't *necessarily* deflate in relation to the economy.

1MB is probably not optimal but the network has calibrated and grown around this arbitrary measure. Any subsequent changes are made in relation to this arbitrary reference, which has become absolute.
Hence the doubling (post-SegWit) to 2MB seems sensible, because it allows enough space for SegWit and Layer 2 to function as per design, and it only represents an effective "halving" of security and decentralization. Perhaps mitigated by SegWit's optimizations in blockspace consumption. A fair trade-off, but with implications we will yet discover.


This reminds of Gavin Andesen's line back in the day... "bad things" ... a CS term borrowed from Chicken Little :)
Miner monopoly is a concern, agreed, yet the network node count is improving, adoption has sky rocketed ever since blocks became full, and price... well.
Many argue that this is economics. Treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen. Every commodity in short supply is perceived to be a desirable good. In Bitcoin's case this applies to scarcity of both tokens and blockspace. Yes, Bitcoin has fundamental political and economic value, but at least 50% of adopters are in it for the price, and show little care or understanding for what makes Bitcoin powerful - its censorship-resistance and robust security. It seems only natural that such a commodity will be expensive regardless of blocksize. Yet, we change a once arbitrary, now absolute blocksize, at our peril.

Its just a commonly accepted fact. One of those stories that I've never really sought proof for because Gavin Andresen says to the developers: "when Satoshi appointed me his successor" and no-one objects. And when Mike Hearn says "When it was just Gav and me and Satoshi he told me in private that one day we must make blocksize as big as possible and mining must run from a very few datacenters". And no-one can really object because there is lack of evidence.
The story is accepted as common knowledge:
The project migrated to Github only a few years later.

With due respect, its not your call, and beyond your power to decide what Bitcoin fee rate is reasonable. 
It cannot be determined programatically or by an individual or by an agreement, or collective willpower. Bitcoin is sailing on the high seas of the open market - its price is determined by speculation and its fee rates by users - not by what they feel is reasonable - but by what they are actually paying miners. This is what is driving fees up. Its plain supply and demand in action, and beyond our control.
I'm not sure Adam Back will appreciate your reactionary stance on a simple tweet polling for opinions, and choosing to make a public "community issue" of it. I strongly advise you contact him in person, and ask his opinion on how he'd like to respond to your concerns.
Bitcoin doesn't care what you or me or Dr Back wants or would prefer. If *almost everybody* agrees with a change then we can action it. If there is contention about a change (e.g. blocksize) then no change is made. This is Satoshi's one and only Golden Rule. The protocol is scriptable but market forces are not. The developers improve the protocol, and the market does with it as it sees fit.

I'll respond to several comments here, since the topic of blocksize is common between all.


I should have been clear since I seem to imply that I believe "no blocksize increase ever". According to the understanding (and security implications) of capacity scaling as outlined in the article I link (  ), the preferred solution is a Layer 2 protocol (e.g. LN) and not a blocksize increase every time there is network congestion.


I agree that the initial limit of 1MB was arbitrary. Even so, the industry and economy has developed with that as a reference point, and so the developers have to scale from this (arbitrary) reference that has become fulcrum.


As I understand it Layer 2 requires both SegWit *and* larger blocks and I agree with the research that determined that 2MB is an adequately sized container for L2 purposes.
That said, I'd be OK with no blocksize increase and an expensive but rock-solid Bitcoin since Litecoin can now adequately fullfill the function of settlement layer (L1) and provide the world with LN and other L2 networks. 
However, I doubt that most core devs are willing to forego the opportunity to have Bitcoin fullfill this role - and retaining their brain trust is key to Bitcoin's continued growth and success.


Equal and widespread access to Bitcoin is important, I agree. Yet, we have to consider its design goals - not only in the whitepaper - but in the light of what Bitcoin has become and can become.
If we decide that its primary objective is to be cheap, to ensure equal access and a remittance use-case, then we forego certain other features. Features such as its security, its censorship resistance and its political characteristic of being anti-state. 
The possibility of a low-fee Bitcoin is rendered null as a result of the design decision that Bitcoin should primarily be secure and immutable. On-chain scaling (via manipulation of blocksize) is impossible in practice because Bitcoin's design criteria necessarily make it 
- slow
- unreliable, and 
- expensive
Another altcoin, or Layer 2 app (built on top of Bitcoin) *can*, however, provide the low fee widely accessible payment network we envision. With SegWit and Layer 2 we get the scaling *and* we get the robust security, *and* the political character of Bitcoin underpinning it.
I don't believe we disagree on anything. I just wanted to clarify my position.

Go ahead :) If its useful to someone. 


During 2015, I dedicated several months to research Bitcoin scaling. Much of what I learnt was thanks to pointers from the core devs, from existing research of large capacity network scaling, and the not-so-intuitive notion of *Induced Demand* in economics (a pointer from core dev Pieter Wuille).
My eventual summary article was published via a few outlets and made enough sense for Dr Adam Back to publicly endorse it:
Later I began looking into the argument put forward by Pieter Wuille: namely that the [Law of Induced Demand]( applies convincingly to the Bitcoin network:
The larger the network being studied, e.g. public road networks, or public health systems, the more applicable the principle of induced demand seems to become:
So, it is a scientific caution that a precedent exists whereby increasing supply (blocksize) will very soon see the demand rise to meet it (congestion -&gt; high fees). There are large entities out there that will rapidly consume cheap blockspace.
That's all still separate from the fundamental security concern of even just doubling blocksize. Those populists demanding larger blocks are either ignorant, or they know exactly why they're trying to weaken Bitcoin. 
We have to be vigilant: rash, unscientific, untested and non-simulated changes to the protocol are irresponsible and contrary to the slow deliberate development pace Bitcoin requires.
One can be in Bitcoin for the price, but that goal overlooks the fundamental features: censorship-resistance, security, long-term robustness. Even with a long-standing insistence on caution and step-by-step change, price has more than doubled. Logically, the core devs' security-first approach is WHY price has increased.

Looks like chain-split is now guaranteed. 
Bitmain (speaking on behalf of an undisclosed collection of partners and supporters and 3 "to-be-revealed" developer teams) throws down the gauntlet.
UAHF is the counter-measure to UASF and sites the Silbert New York agreement as its foundation. The "project that calls itself Core" and Blockstream are not referred to by name and are framed as enemies of Bitcoin.


Two Bitcoins with two different visions.


Developer teams are evidently in place and ready to work on this chain's client software.


Change management apparently informed by economic demands and *strong sentiment* ("strength" of emotion), as opposed to unanimous support only in the consensus chain.


The current increase schedule is 2MB blocksize in Aug 2017, 4MB in Sept 2018 all the way to 16MB by Aug 2019.
There we have it. This outcome was going to happen. It's disruptive, yes, but in the interest of security and progress of the consensus chain.
Pursuing a persistent blocksize increase regiment while failing to factor in the effect of Induced Demand, means the UAHF chain makes itself vulnerable to ever-weakening security, larger throughput and eventual tx congestion and high fees.

Just to be clear: a stock market is where company shares (for ownership) are traded. Some people call the bitcoin price market a currency market similar to forex, but this isn't the case. When trading forex via a broker, traders are not buying and selling physical quantities of currency but, instead, *contracts for difference (CFD)* - similar to what you do when you bet on a game or a horse at the bookie.
In the Bitcoin exchanges, actual bitcoin exchange hands - traders buy and sell bitcoin - so these are commodity markets where you pay fiat for goods (bitcoin).
There are bitcoin CFD instruments such as the BitMex BTC/USD instrument and OKEX Futures. These markets are more complex to trade and expose traders to extreme risk (loss of total account).

I cannot say with 100% confidence or provide a link to the exact email, but I do somehow recall that this was being said by one (or both) of them on occasion. That there was a period just after Satoshi left when it was just them. Hearn was spinning the narrative that Satoshi communicated extensive details with him in private about a high tx capacity future with miners preferably restricted to a few datacenters. That is strange. Of course, no proof was provided, and that is why the seniority game was being played.
Were you following the dev mailing list during the months prior to Andresen fading and Hearn leaving? If so, you'll recall they both began the seniority game then and started putting pressure on Wladimir to make development direction calls, or else be declared incompetent as maintainer. There was a lot of conflict in the list for about 6 months and it reached fever pitch when Gavin and Mike released XT.

Security: your bitcoin private key (that is used to sign your spending) is uncrackable for billions of years as computing stands now. That is good security for storing value.
Political change: Bitcoin's blockchain cannot be altered while Bitcoin is secure, so it is "censorship resistant". So we must ask: censorship resistant against who? Well, against the state, of course. Government and banks. They can never stop it or control it. Which is exactly what they would like to do as with everything else. So, Bitcoin is anti-state. That's political. The designers of Bitcoin knew that. The state knows that. Very few Bitcoin users know that. Most people think Bitcoin is electronic money for getting rich :)

Exactly, because SegWit effectively allows for smaller blocks, and Layer 2 "caches" txns until they're flushed to settlement.

@_date: 2017-06-14 04:06:33
Fair appraisal of the way forward.
One point, though: the nefarious character of "fiat" is not only in the paper currency, but in its inflation via credit.
```Money supply = cash in circulation + credit```
With a private blockchain, the crypto tokens can still be inflated (at will) and tokens can also be lent out (mutiplied as credit) via fractional reserve.
Granted, it will migrate people to blockchain usage, but the actual mechanism will mostly be hidden from view. Digital transactions (such as we have today) will continue to be conducted via online banking, credit and debit cards.
What does change, is that cenbanks open themselves to a whole new range of attack vectors.

I think you're reading too much into Adam Back's statement. 
In the real world people are paying these kinds of fees. Nowhere in the whitepaper does it say "a low fee payment network". Of course, if Bitcoin's security is dependent on limited blockspace, then it follows that on-chain fees will be high.
As per the SegWit and Layer 2 solutions - that Adam Back supports - we will have lower fees and near instant transactions. But Bitcoin remains difficult to scale, so Layer 1 (on-chain) fees will always remain high, as I explore here:
We need to have honest discussions about the cold hard facts. People are paying the kind of fees Adam Back mentions. There is no way anyone can impose those kinds of fees on Bitcoin - its design does not allow for this.
I genuinely believe you're reading too much into Adam's words. He's asking a question - not "taking a stance" - and it's a public tweet, not some private conversation published via WikiLeaks, right?

The task is impossible because the numbers involved are stupendous.
A Bitcoin private key is a random number of the order [quindecillion]( That is 10^48 - a number size that has never been harnessed before Bitcoin.
The Large Bitcoin Collider seeks to collide with existing private keys. It has only managed this with keys created by a particular broken random number generator. Guessing a private key generated by even a standard or medium entropy RNG is trillions and trillions of times less likely than winning the lottery.
Questioning the strength of Bitcoin's ECDSA keys is a necessary exercise but in the end the futility of trying to break it becomes obvious:

This is exactly what has happened, but people have used names like Litecoin, Namecoin, etc. All the altcoins out there are simply clones of the Bitcoin source code with alterations that make each altcoin suitable for a different use-case.
The challenge with creating an altcoin is to generate "network effect", to attract users and stakeholders, and, of course, miners to invest resources in the clone rather than in an existing lucrative network like Bitcoin, or Etherium, etc


Bitcoin is, in part, a response to the monetary policy of central banks who cut national currency from a reference (gold) standard in 1971. Now they can "print" as much currency as they want. Each time they do, they devalue every existing unit of currency in circulation - effectively defrauding holders of that currency without their permission.
Bitcoin's 21mil token limit is not artificial but real. The limit is enforced by the protocol code and cannot be altered by any entity while Bitcoin remains decentralized and secure.
This is, among other features, what gives Bitcoin fundamental value.
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:25:30


Interesting you should say that. Dominant. In the world.
I enjoy discussing these things because Bitcoin is a new phenomenon with special properties and potential.
It's like that often repeated movie scenario (the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves) where an alien civilization lands on earth and the first point of contact is the US military - the strong arm of finance capital of the dominant super-power. As if.
Some great people and ideas did indeed originate in the dominant cultures of their time, but many times we find that greatness exists in low places, even in isolation. These conditions do not diminish the greatness, but makes it exemplary.
On the other hand, those who demand greatness, who achieve it by aggressive means, show us their own insecurity, their false pride, and need for recognition. Like the fundamentalist religion that declares it will dominate every culture and corner of the globe. Like the British ruling class who wanted to paint the whole map red, and now they've divided the working class and left them with a compliance obsessed society where a disenfranchised youth read the police their rights.
There is no mention of dominant cryptocurrency in the whitepaper, nor is there a need for it. That Bitcoin should be a flagship of robust security and censorship-resistance, now, *that* we can justify from the design document and creator's vision.
To be as secure as it can possibly be, Bitcoin does not need to dominate. Its anti-state political character probably excludes the possibility of dominance in the foreseeable future. Wall Street and the central banks have other plans for cryptocurrency.
To be as secure as it can possibly be, we need to maximize our adherence to consensus rule - Satoshi's only Golden Rule - and to ensure maximum decentralization. Neither of these qualities require the leadership structure of other open source projects. The challenge before us is to maintain these qualities and make Bitcoin the most secure without leadership and through Consensus alone.
Yes, the temptation is there to fall back to our conditioned dependence on chieftainship, monarchy, centralized authority, trusted third parties, and so forth. But, ironically, this is exactly what Bitcoin has come to destroy.
This thing Bitcoin is a brainchild of the cypherpunks. They are still here.

Indeed, and this illustrates the complexity of the scaling large networks. But it doesn't imply that scaling is impossible, it simply suggests that scaling is not always possible in the most evident manner.
What the studies, of say, public road networks or healthcare systems, do show us is that simply increasing scale (supply) at points of congestion does not, in the long-run, reduce the congestion.
This is of particular interest to Bitcoin, because we have hundreds of years of case studies that tell us that simply increasing blocksize is not the correct solution to congestion and high tx fees. In fact, the historic precedents suggest that doing so will exacerbate both the congestion *and* the fee rates.
The core devs are well aware of the Law of Induced Demand, which is why they chose to implement both a fee incentive alignment (SegWit) and a layering solution.
Many (most?) of the txns currently waiting in mempool are microtransactions. Their low BTC value makes the fees exorbitant by comparison. Conducting smaller, low value txns via Layer 2 relieves both congestion and mitigates fees.
I will definitely use L2 frequently and perhaps make a few on-chain txns during a year, because some txns are large and require the specific features and security that makes Bitcoin valuable. In a way there is almost no limit to the fees I am willing to pay for some of the transactions I can only conduct via Bitcoin.

Great explanation of SegWit fee incentive alignment. Always have time for Andreas Antonopoulos. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:25:53


This much is true. Given its defiance vs the establishment it needs good security. As per the design specification in the whitepaper, Bitcoin's censorship resistance (immutability) is paramount - if it loses that then Bitcoin has been lost and we have all lost.
We can discuss what we would like Bitcoin to become and what features we value most, e.g. low fees, fast confirmation times, etc, but all those wants and need are ultimately subject to Bitcoin's fundamental security requirement. And whichever way we cut it, in the final analysis Bitcoin's security is directly dependent on blocksize.
Hence, for Bitcoin to remain secure, blockspace will always remain scarce, and scarce blockspace attracts whatever fees users are willing to pay. People are paying higher and higher fees right now and the daily tx count continues rising. This is the market telling us it is willing to pay.
Larger blocks, besides reducing security, will simply attract more transactions and the same high fees will remain. We cannot code away market forces. To try to do so while sacrificing security would be great folly.
Of course, SegWit activation will be followed by a blocksize doubling and introduce Layer 2 protocols like Lightning Network that will allow almost unlimited numbers of near-instant BTC transactions at low fees.

We agree. 
Do you know when did Roger Ver "adopt"?  - I believe he ran a mining operation in his warehouse. This point is interesting because a lot of Ver's soapboxing is prefaced with "I was one of the first big investors in Bitcoin". Sort of trying to bamboozle the audience with seniority and bravery...
The word "assigned" comes from Gavin Andresen's own mouth. I've never heard the developers object to this claim. And Hearn always piggy-backed on this with "yes, after Satoshi left it was just me and Gav.". Another seniority tactic. You might have seen the frequency with which the two of them tried to enforce ideas in developers mailing list: Gavin says "We have to increase blocksize or bad things will happen" and the very next email comes from Hearn: "I agree with Gavin." Andresen started frequently referring to himself as an "old man" implying wistfully that his many years allowed him to see deeper into the implications of not raising blocksize. "Bad things" he used to say again and again, as he, no doubt, stroked his grey beard.
After Hearn left, Gavin Andresen had already done all the damage to ostracize himself. He had very little support and no-one who could backup the seniority game. So he - and his opinion - just became irrelevant.
I tend to agree with your acknowledgment of his work as lead maintainer, but feel no inclination to praise the man - his short-sightedness and lack of vision at the time was disappointing and disrupted productive development work. His petulant attacks on those who challenged him showed that he was not capable in his role. 
The moment Andresen and Hearn were no longer posting to the list, the amount of work and progress just accellerated. I remember that clearly and it is evident from the dev mailing list archives.

@_date: 2017-06-27 07:53:51
Maybe you're joking and the thought did make me smile.
I am not alone in looking at it like this:
The idea that Bitcoin could lose its first mover advantage, its lead, its network effect, etc is expressed with trepidation by many Bitcoin business owners and all-in stakeholders. Their fear is understandable but their wish that Bitcoin should remain the biggest and attract most business is based on mistaken assumptions about its design and nature.
Bitcoin is Beta Software, hence the version number starting with 0.x
Bitcoin was designed by activists - the cypherpunks - as a benefit to society but also as a tool to agitate the state.
Bitcoin is designed to have specific attributes - security and robustness - that make it censorship resistant. By favoring certain attributes, others are necessarily sacrificed.
Since Bitcoin is an ongoing experiment and contains - at its core -everything that the state and the establishment is working to erode in society, it does not make sense that businesses which are essentially bank satellites should attempt to steer Bitcoin's design and development toward their wishlist: more adoption, global dominance, more profit.
Bitcoin cannot fit all use cases - cannot be all things to all people - it is good for some things, but other altcoins are much better suited to other use cases. Surely this is inevitable, and a "good thing"!

What a judgment!
Help me out, then, what is the ideal series of steps to make Bitcoin work best, economically?
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:20:42
Its this: 
*Decentralized digital currency* has **no controlling authority** and in Bitcoin's case a **finite money supply**. Changes to the algorithms and network that makes Bitcoin possible, can only be done if there is consensus among all participants (95%+ agreement). This is a protection and a confidence validation for holders.
*Centralized currency*, specifically latter-day fiat supply, is **inflated and deflated without permission** of holders. The **devaluation** of fiat currencies via central bank quantitative easing during the past 9 years serves as a prime example. 
As for *daily payment*, digital currencies are prone to volatile exchange rates - precisely because they don't have controlling central banks working day and night to stabilize their nominal exchange rates. Despite what many users and advocates of Bitcoin like to think: *using bitcoin for low-value incidental payments and day-to-day expenses is* **wasteful** - it is expensive (fees, resources), slow (multiple confirmations) and its network can be unreliable (unpredictable chain reorgs and network congestion).
*Fiat cash* - while you don't want to hold a lot of it (bail-ins!) - or hold it for a long time (devaluation by its creator!) - is far **more fungible and better suited** to casual transactions and running expenses.
For Bitcoin to be good at what it does, being a *secure store of value* and *censorship resistant transmission network*, it does not need for other currencies to disappear. In fact, **if there were no centralized currencies and fiat, the very need for Bitcoin would diminish**. Its not a case of "best" or "superior" - just a case of suitability to certain needs - different types of money and stores of value all have their strengths and weaknesses - including Bitcoin, as mentioned above.

I imagine there will always be one miner that is bigger than the rest, so, let's not demonize all miners. However, in many respects miners' and users' incentives are not aligned: 
Users have an ideological and political incentive to see Bitcoin remain decentralized and censorship resistant.
Miners, being businesses with collective power over the network, are prone to cartel behavior, and are vulnerable to being "bought" and must play by the dirty rules of capitalism if they want to survive.


On this point I must disagree. Bitcoin cannot be cheap to use *and* decentralized at the same time. Since Bitcoin's security is dependent on blocksize -  a constraint imposed by a design decision 
- then it means block space will always be scarce and to use Bitcoin will, therefore, always be relatively expensive.
Layer 2 apps might make micro-transactions cheaper, but the "anchoring" (opening) of a channel will still incur an expensive on-chain mining fee.

As far as I understand it, SegWit (BIP141) kills ASICboost. The NY80 SegWit2x allows use of ASICboost to continue unhindered. I might be mistaken and I'm not sure if the NY80 use of BIP141 code still allows signaling via bit 4 rather than bit 1 (in the block header's Version field).
Edit: The answer to the version bits issue is clarified (in detail), here: 
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:59:58
"Believe" being the operative term! :)
I have been sufficiently convinced, by mathematician Stephen J. Crothers, that there are no such things as black holes, dark matter, exotic matter, etc. Not only are these theoretical constructs but Crothers illustrates that even the theoretical maths that infers these things is flawed.
Of course, observed data can be interpreted to fit quantum theory, but it has sent quantum science on a mad goose chase: they had to invent dark matter to make black holes "work", then additional observational data required them to invent exotic matter, etc.
Rationally, if the the theory keeps being contradicted by actual observation, and forces more and more invented theoretical particles to tape the theory together, then the base assumptions of the theory is incorrect.
I'm not saying this only to be contrarian. Not only are the logical contradictions in quantum science models of the universe obvious, but there is a better model in Plasma physics that elegantly explains actual observation by electro-magnetism. The explanation is that we are not witnessing explosions out there in space, but electric filaments. Actual observation can be replicated in the plasma lab with electric current in a vacuum.

You may be correct on those points, but I believe there are two additional scenarios here:
1) UASF causes a chainsplit on 1 Aug, in which case (UAHF or not) the chain splits
2) Consensus chain (status quo) supporters reach a resolution to push Bitmain, Ver and Co. over the edge by supporting UASF on the day. Chain split.
When you spend too much time with a confrontational guy in the dorm, at some point the group simply evicts them for the sake of peace. It might be a temporary or permanent setback but Bitcoin (the consensus chain) will survive it.

As you said in a previous response, an adversary can misrepresent and distort any statement to fit their accusation.
Adam Back has a track record of championing privacy. Watching his mediation among developers has been instructive and I am of the opinion that he is one of the "good guys".
If you have interaction with him, it may be better to delete this outcry in public, and discuss the matter with him in person?
Just for the record, myself and many other Bitcoin users/miners/entrepreneurs I deal with, have made peace with the prospect of $100+ fees in the future. This much is obvious and no-one can change it, not even Adam Back, because the protocol is immutable and the fee market is determined (priced) between miners and those who transact.
Even with SegWit signalling, we are still over a year away from SegWit activation, and a 2MB HF will probably follow only months after. So, expect fees to continue going up.

Cargo Cultism is also apparent in the UASF - force infrastructure a certain way and it will end the diagreement and the gods will send down all good things.
Forcing UASF is, in fact, not the end of the blocksize debate. Its the beginning of the civil war, because a reactionary loves nothing better than an insult to justify a counter-attack.

The tweet contains no language that implies a "stance". It is a statement of conjecture about what people might be willing to pay. Given certain conditions, I and most people I have discussed this matter with, are willing to pay $20 and $100 to do on-chain transactions in favor of cheaper, perhaps less-secure Litecoin or Lightning Network transactions.
In popular usage, one can, generally, not *misrepresent* oneself. Other people are said to misrepresent us or something we said. This is what is happening here. Your rhetoric creates the appearance of a misrepresentation with the goal of raising a stink, in order to bait a  response and perhaps cast doubt and aspersions on the target.
That's under-handed. Especially in the context of Bitcoin - a technology that should be managed by consensus and not popular opinion. Factionalism always has a minority/majority but not ever Consensus.


You misunderstand despite a whitepaper clarification and several comments that point this out to you: The community cannot determine tx fees any more than it can determine the open market price of a bitcoin. It is logically, programmatically and economically impossible. Trying to do so is the road to central bank madness: lower interest rates; hike interest rates; inflate the currency; fiddle inflation figures. Even thinking that it is possible to "shape" or steer the economy of a myriad of entities, and irrational human psychology, is the human comedy of errors.
You're clearly on the attack using words like "stance" and "defend", but again, I say to you in truth, you have misunderstood those words in that tweet and have read all kinds of dark intentions into them. 
They simply represent the musings of a man who has recognized, long ago, the truth that Bitcoin fees cannot be set in stone or dialled at will. Fees will rise and fall according to usage and demand, regardless of the capacity of the network. 
The economic Law of Induced Demand tells us that increased supply (of blockspace) will rapidly be filled by demand. Tweaking blocksize is not the way to scale Bitcoin or set price ceilings on the fee market. Layers are the solution.
If you lay down your sword, and speak honorably with those who have insulted you, then you will be vindicated and learn from them (that which cannot be learnt during a siege) and they will be better off with your useful input. Bitcoin will be stronger.

Painting all SegWit supporters, and this entire sub, with the same brush that its a profit motive, you're missing the point and demonizing people who see the value of Bitcoin, just like you do.
There is research, and many case study examples dating back to Roman times, that warns us that simply increasing blocksize is not likely to relieve the congestion and incumbent high fee rates.
The phenomenon, encountered in large scale networks like public road networks and health care networks, is called Induced Demand and it is a principle whereby increased capacity simply results in the new supply of capacity being rapidly filled by massive demand. Hence, the congestion remains and the effort was wasted.
Well, we can say, let's try it anyway and see if we're lucky and manage to increase scale. But in the case of Bitcoin, blocksize also happens to be the critical parameter that correlates directly to overall network security. 
We mess with blocksize at our peril - and by putting at risk Other People's Money - and at the risk of breaking Bitcoin itself.
Many many users, and even some devs, don't understand this mechanism: blocksize is a crucial parameter of network security. It's one of those Bitcoin quirks that is not immediately and intuitively obvious, because its a unique mechanism of the innovation that is not found elsewhere in the wider IT landscape.
There are many benefits to scaling and I think most (~95%) of people here and among the devs and in the general ecosystem agree that we should scale. I don't think it is incorrect to say that there is consensus for the notion that Bitcoin should scale.
Where we don't have consensus is in *how* we should scale. All the politics and profit motives aside - we can only make the changes that enable scaling once we have consensus on the exact details of such a roadmap. That is the ideal and correct way to proceed.
However, if there is an ideological schizm and irreconcilable differences between the factions' vision for Bitcoin, then parting ways is probably the only solution. 
Everybody loses in war.

As u/dietrolldietroll says, when you send bitcoin to someone else's address, they're not lost - they just belong to someone else.

@_date: 2017-06-21 15:21:39
To answer directly and clearly:
Bitcoin is *not* deflationary.
The idea was introduced by a Stimple Jak journalist some years ago. A currency/commodity cannot be "deflationary" - its a misnomer and incorrect application of the term.
Correctly stated: Bitcoin has a fixed money supply.
At present, Bitcoin is vulnerable to all of the vices of fiat, since it is offered on loan (credit) by exchanges or can be turned into debt via a credit note. Hence, if honored per UTXO on the blockchain, bitcoin is sound money. But when lent out, with collateral, or misrepresented via fractional reserve (as many of the popular exchanges do) then *their* action artificially inflates the bitcoin in circulation.
The currency itself does not preclude the debt-centered tendency of modern human psychology. Hence, the need for exchanges to "share" liquidity, the flood of ICOs, Big Block cults, etc.

OP, your interpretation of what Adam Back is saying seems incorrect: he is not saying this is a design goal, or desirable, for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-06-08 20:06:15
I think you confuse the computer science term "decentralized network" with the human science term "equal access".
As I explained to Mike Hearn a few weeks before his breakdown:
Here in my rural neighborhood the laborers get paid in cash once a week. The farmers, factory owners and fishermen get paid cash at product delivery. All of this cash is tax-free because it is below the threshold set by this SE Asian govt.
The local market is open 3 days each week and people come from far and wide to buy and sell local produce and goods. The transactions are cash, with no debit or credit cards in use, and no payment terminal facilities anyway.
Several times a week, especially in monsoon season, the electricity goes down for hours at a time. Sometimes long enough for the backup batteries in the local cellphone towers to run flat. No electricity and no connectivity, sometimes for 12 hours.
What I describe above is the reality for billions of people world wide. I've seen it all across Africa, in South America and the Caribbean. Asia is home to the largest contingent of rural people in the world. Billions.
As much as I am familiar with these people and their neighbor, do we really want to burden them with a reliance on Bitcoin? Does it make sense, after all, to imagine them transacting competently using digital currency when they are psychologically and physically reliant on paper cash? 
And happily so, because they are not the ones being subjected to monstrous surveillance, to exploitative banking fees, to crippling taxes and compelled by advertising to earn and spend every day of the week.
Bitcoin was designed as an anti-dote to central bank fraud, It is most useful to the middle-classes in the cities of the West. The do-goodery that wants to export it to the "unbanked poor" is simply avoiding its own duty and responsibility to challenge exploitative centralized authority with the effective weapon it has been gifted with.
Hence, arguing about high fees for a global majority that don't even want Bitcoin is double deluded. I hope you can see what I am trying to unpack for you.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:34:29
It's actually the opposite of what you're thinking :)
If there is a chain-split (via UASF or UAHF) then any coins you held before the split will be present on both chains. Your bitcoin will have doubled.
If both chains continue to be mined and two separate coins (say, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Unlimited) exist side by side, then you will be able to transact your coins on the Bitcoin chain, as normal, and also the same amount of coins on the BU chain.
Each chain does not know what happens on the other chain.
Keeping your coins in a personal wallet around the time of the expected chain-split (1 Aug) is exactly the recommended thing to do.

Scaling to more transaction capacity than VISA, as well as those transactions being cheaper - and denominated in BTC - is possible via the Lightning Network and other Layer 2 protocols.

You're asking all the right questions.
Velocity is probably dependent on the market majority's desire to spend. When price is high (relative to fiat) the long-term holders (HODLers) concede some bitcoin for desirable goods. Of course, there are also the incidental (non-investing) spenders who move into and out of BTC for specific transactions such as remittance or darknet purchases.
Expenditure requires merchants to accept BTC for goods/services, just like fiat, but there is a deeper and more important characteristic of Bitcoin: that it is programmable money and Censorship Resistant. In this regard, Bitcoin is both contract and notary, as well as a political weapon against state (government and bank).
A lot of value there - for the most part overlooked by merchants and incidental users - and not valued into the price at all, since most users are faddists and not activists.

The SegWit code has been merged in the reference client (Core) for several months.
The hardcoded activation mechanism is that miners should signal SegWit in the blocks they mine with a special flag. After SegWit has been signaled in 2016 consecutive blocks, then a countdown of several months begins until it is activated in the protocol. 
That's the roadmap, and Satoshi's golden rule for Bitcoin is Consensus rule: Only make changes if there is near-unanimous (~95%) agreement. If not, then don't make the change.
All is well. Bitcoin is secure and that is the primary requirement. Fears about it becoming  to some altcoin, or that less businesses may use it, that it will somehow "fail" if it is not the biggest and first and the most dominant, etc etc are unfounded. 
The worst thing that can happen is that Consensus be discarded, even just once.

This is because pubkeys (whether xpub or regular format) are not recorded in transactions or in the blockchain at all.
Instead, once you successfully import the xpub to a wallet, it will regenerate the Bitcoin addresses of your blocktrail wallet. You can search a block explorer for those addresses.
As  suggested by u/dietrolldietroll you should raise the issue with Blocktrail support. Their xpub / xprv export seems to be buggy.

This is a great discussion, above, and I agree with several points you both make:
- Consensus rule. If there is not near-unanimous agreement on a change to the protocol, then leave it be. The main proponent can attempt to change the BIP, lobby for consensus, etc but populist tactics and fear mongering is the path to the Dark side
- Yes, the initial 1MB limit was arbitrary, but like every arbitrary measure that becomes a constant in society, once the economy and infrastructure have developed around it, changing that constant is complicated and cascades through the system in unforeseen ways
- although 2MB seems small, doubling blocksize is extreme. Especially if there is not a simultaneous scaling of the infrastructure that will transport, manage and maintain those blocks (and double the amount of txns and associated protocol messages).
- SegWit optimizes blockspace usage, reduces network traffic (and brings great security enhancements), so with SegWit in place, the impact of doubling blocksize should be less severe. We hope ;)
- The assumptions we intuitively make about Supply and Demand generally don't match what happens in the real world
- *Financial and commodity markets* (market prices) are driven by speculation which, in turn, is driven by Social Mood.  *Economy* (widest possible definition, including all people, entities in all territories) is driven by Supply and Demand which we intuitively assume is based on rational necessity, but which is also influenced by Social Mood! 
Bitcoin's security and robustness are its core fundamental values. To have meaning Bitcoin must remain as decentralized as possible, in order to remain censorship resistant. All other dreams and designs for Bitcoin are subject to these values. Via Consensus rule, of course!

As you say, this is and will always be the contentious issue: blocksize increase.
Now that a majority of hashrate is signalling SegWit2x - which (if I understand correctly) is Core's BIP141 code for SegWit, then we will have a rushed lock-in of SegWit (not _2x) before Aug 1st.
SegWit is, arguably, what most people want. SegWit (BIP141) has a planned HF to 2MB blocks later, but Silbert &amp; Co's _2x has an undefined roadmap to 2MB blocksize.
Around Oct 15th, BU's BUIP55 enacts a HF that starts a schedule of blocksize increases way beyond 2MB (on their forked chain). This matches Bitmain's published plan that an undisclosed group of developers are coding a blocksize increase schedule to 16MB by end-2019.
Whatever the case, whether BU and Bitmain are in cahoots or not, there is strong sentiment (Silbert's 80+ businesses and BU adherents) in favor of the hare-brained idea that bigger blocks will resolve congestion and lower fees. Miners, whether they know it or not, will benefit from increased fees due to continued congestion as latent demand fills up the additional blockspace supply.
Increasing blocksize is inconsistent with a secure, censorship resistant Bitcoin. So, even Core's roadmapped 2MB HF is a compromise required by Layer 2. It may turn out to be unnecessary.

The group's dislike of the Core devs is strong e.g. descriptions like "insidious", "hypocritical", "misinformation propaganda"...

May I ask a reply, in turn? I am keen to hear your thinking and account of the sequence of events that follow a blocksize increase. For example if blocksize doubled tomorrow, what do you expect to see happen to transaction count, fees, network usage and congestion over a period of, say, a year?

I don't quite get your reasoning here. Miners are in it for profit. Some of them care nothing for Bitcoin or any vision for its future. They only want to become billionaires during this 2 year rally and then stay or go depending on the outcomes.
All of this is a lesson of history. We don't have to be emotionally invested in it or feel fear. Fear is the path to the dark side, as the saying goes.
This saga will run its course and we will learn, whatever the outcome. Bitcoin is fine. Once the rally subsides, fees will go down and todays dominant miners will also chew hard bones. There is no urgency. Panicked (emotive) decisions always make for a hilarious Mr Bean episode :)
Edit: I remember, in my neighborhood, there was a family who were responsible for the local drug trade. They caused many young people to waste money and life, and mothers to weep. Everyone knew who they were and what they were doing, but they were dangerous, and paid off the regional police. Their justification was that well brought up youngsters and responsible adults would not do drugs anyway, so their service was not to blame. The one day the police found the main culprit, Staggi, burnt to a crisp in the street. The community had had enough and fathers, mothers and grandparents alike took justice in their own hands. UASF does not equate to "taking justice in our own hands" - it is merely stomping on the foot of a dangerous adversary.

It is possible, e.g.: 
The inherent sacrifice of using a decentralized database (blockchain) versus a centralized (traditional) database is that blockchain is:
- slow
- unreliable
- expensive
The benefit of blockchain, of course, is censorship-resistance. So, whether or not the social media platform needs this feature is the main determinant.
WikiLeaks would benefit, but it is doubtful that Facebook and Twitter need it, or that their owners would give up centralized control of their billion dollar properties.

The UAHF roadmap presented by Bitmain today includes activation of SegWit. I believe you're missing the political power-play here: Bitmain and friends want to eliminate the Core developers and Blockstream by hijacking Bitcoin's brand and network. They're playing their cards with a populist tactic at the time when ecosystem sentiment is polarized.
UAHF *is* SegWit2x. In fact, UAHF is SegWit16x !
I prefer Bitcoin remains unchanged because it works as described in the whitepaper and it is secure. Since the issue is being pressed aggressively from various angles, fullnode and mining operators are being forced to pick a side.
Apparently, Bitmain is only doing UAHF if Core supporters do UASF. Why? Because they benefit in either case: they retain majority hashrate and fee income if the UASF is abandoned. They get exactly the same if they dominate the UAHF chain. Bigger blocks only lead to more fee income.

Bitcoin has a decentralized p2p network, meaning it is censorship-resistant and lacks a kill-switch. Think BitTorrent except with counterfeit-proof payload (tokens).
Bitcoin is also open source, meaning anyone can read the source code and contribute. People do so daily. No backdoor or lie lurks in the code.
Hence Bitcoin is what it is and govt cannot stop or change it - provided we constantly guard Bitcoin security.
Central banks are, however, developing their own private blockchains and they will soon be issuing cryptocurrency fiat to replace anonymous cash and as a means of doing surveillance. 
They will sell it to the public as being "based on the amazing blockchain technology". But without open source code, without open participation (mining by anyone), the cenbank blockchain won't be decentralized and tamper-proof - it will be a sham and a coercion, as you describe.
Bitcoin is revolutionary. Voluntary. The real deal. Money for the people by the people.
Long Live Bitcoin! Long Live!

Lawrence Summers is a piece of work: 
Highly connected and influential, he was also a Fed member, president of Harvard, instrumental in the privatization of the post-Soviet economy, and led the charge in deregulating the US economy in the years leading up to the derivatives and CDS inspired 2008 rapid credit deflation crisis.
Currently, he is championing the cause of systematically banning cash. Here's a brief discussion:
See under the heading *Calls To Scrap The $100 Note*.
As Andreas Antonopoulos frequently points out, we are approaching the day when central banks will replace paper fiat with crypto fiat. The idea will ostensibly be sold to the public under the Distributed Ledger Tech banner, although it will, of course, be a meaningless private blockchain. Its benefits to the central bank are:
- eradication of anonymous cash
- absolute surveillance of all national cryptocurrency activity
- greater perceived control of economy and financial stability, and other such false promises.

It's more complicated that just making mining easy for a while :)
For starters, the protocol algorithmically adjusts difficulty in an attempt to keep block times at 10min intervals. 
If you want to understand how all the factors work together you'll need to do some research. Start with the Wiki at  also read the book Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos:
At the heart of the matter is the security requirement that Bitcoin blockspace must necessarily be a scarce resource. So, in a way of looking, all of this drama about high fees is just, well, drama - it's Bitcoin working as designed - and the community hitting the first tantrums of adolescence.

The Bitcoin cash system has production costs that are called miner fees in the whitepaper.
Traditionally, the issuer (central bank) would carry the costs of minting, distributing and managing cash supply. In this case, of Peoples' money, the costs are socialized (shared among all).
There is another quirk of the Bitcoin cash system: not only are the tokens scarce, but so is its blockspace - limited physically and technologically - a balance struck between supply, demand, and security. Since blocksize is a primary determining factor in the network's degree of decentralization and security, we find that we cannot scale via manipulating blocksize. Layers are the solution to scaling. Yet, the matter of scarce blockspace remains and its value is determined by the market - by users actually choosing to pay those fees for the network service provided by miners.
Given the constraints, we Bitcoiners will have to learn to spend frugally - only when necessary - to consolidate payments - and to learn to use the Layer 2 apps when we want cheap, fast micro-transactions. Of course, there will still be fees, because this is not paper cash or cowrie shells; this is digital cash like VISA only much more secure and censorship resistant.

My flexible-yet-secure suggestion is:
- export your privkeys from MultiBit
- store them in a password manager (which you also regularly backup to 2 external storage devices)
- change the password on the MultiBit wallet to a strong password generated by your password manager
- while you're at it, export and store the Breadwallet privkeys to the password manager
- protect your password manager with a strong passphrase! 
Leave the MultiBit wallet installed. It's never a good idea to rely on a single application to remain reliable. Neither MultiBit nor Breadwallet score high in the flexibility department (also consider Electrum), yet having two options is better than none when things go wrong.
Distribute your bitcoin between both wallets - in different addresses and with at least one common address shared between wallets.

Forex rates is a complex field because, although we imagine that they represent fair, duly discovered values of one currency in relation to another, they are actually highly manipulated - often openly, and sometiimes behind the scenes.
The first thing to realize is that central banks constantly manipulate their national currency's value versus other major trading currencies or "yardstick" currencies such as the USD. This is done to sway the rate in the nation's favor pending major international trade transactions, but mainly as a means of creating the facade of currency stability. **Currency stability (and, therefore, manipulation) is a central bank mandate**. 
Sometimes central banks announce their valuation targets, e.g. the Bank of Japan had been announcing, since 2011, that they would be implementing massive quantitative easing of 11tril JPY between 2013 and 2018 to **devalue the JPY** in relation to the USD, CNY and other regional currencies. The objective was to lower the price of Japanese exports to foreign markets and boost Japanese trade, create jobs and attempt to stimulate the Japanese economy out of decades of deflation.
Of course, an unspoken effect was that they would directly muscle in on their neighbor China's export market share, so the PBOC responded with a series of ongoing "one-off" devaluations of the CNY! :)
Other times, central banks **peg a national currency** to a standard like the USD. E.g. Saudi Arabia's Real was pegged to a certain exchange rate vs the USD for decades until the 2015 commodities slump (i.e. low oil prices) began depleting their **USD foreign reserves**. In order to maintain the peg level of their currency (vs USD), the Saudi central bank would have to sell USD against the SAR/USD pair every time the Saudi Real strengthened (or the USD weakened, which it did). However, with record low oil prices, Saudi Arabia was having to use its USD foreign reserves to stop-gap its own domestic budget, as well as fund the escalating war against Shiite Muslim neighbors. Hence they began planning to drop the USD peg (unannounced, of course!)
There are many other shenanigans and mechanisms, the above are just two examples.
**Large traders** (banks and hedge funds), tend to trade within the range that they interpret (or know) the currency's central bank will adhere to or allow.
**Small traders** (retail traders) mostly fumble around the forex market trying to interpolate and triangulate what the banks will do - over the long-term - and other intraday traders over the short-term.
When it comes to bitcoin price, the vectors change - mainly because **bitcoin does not have a central authority manipulating its price to a target**. Bitcoin sails on the high seas of the open market! (Note: *open* market, not *free* market. The "free market" is the self-proclaimed domain of traditional finance capital - a separate issue I won't address here).
A second important feature of the bitcoin market - and one that distinguishes it from the forex market - is that bitcoin does not trade like a currency. Instead, **bitcoin trades as a commodity**. 
Whereas currency charts are range bound and constrained by central bank imposed upper and lower limits, commodity charts are driven by speculation. Specifically, by *greed* and *fear*. Tremendous greed for upside combines with fear of larger economic threats (hence, safe haven), as well as, fear of missing out. This is a potent combination for herding behavior and bullish stampedes.
Bitcoin's exchange rate vs various fiat currencies is less determined by real-world forex rates, than it is by **regional valuation** and specific **local conditions**. That is why prices differ between exchanges and also why a bitcoin can be worth $3000 in the US and $3500 in India. In a sense, the Indian bitcoin market is saying that the Rupee is worth even less than what its central bank says it is worth (in USD). So as Andreas Antonopoulos explains: its not that bitcoin is worth more in India, but that bitcoin buyers are revealing the actual value of the rupee. This is a subtle point, and I'm not sure I explained it clearly...
There is much more to discuss around this topic, but the above is a conceptual framework that gives more insight than the over-simplified (and mostly inappropriate) model of mere supply-and-demand. Supply and demand (economics) still has an influence, but the driver - the price waves we see in the chart - are driven by commodity speculation. Bitcoin pricing, in fiat terms, differs regionally because fiat pricing is neither representative nor efficient.

I don't think anyone doubts that Satoshi Nakamoto was a cypherpunk. As Andreas Antonopoulos says, most people - even if they know that Bitcoin is a product of the Cypherpunk movement - either don't bother to find out what that means or they soon forget this critical fact in the hustle and bustle of price, debates and excitement.
I'm surprised that a fellow Bitcoin enthusiast should ask me to prove that - especially if they can just point their browser at a search engine and investigate the truth for themselves.
Anyhow, let's look at a short definition of "[cypherpunk](




The [Cypherpunk Manifesto]( listed at the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute, describes the same key characteristics:
- belief in the right to privacy vs the state
- technology as an agent of social and political change
- quest for a digital currency
- use of cryptography as a means of enforcing individual privacy
As a demonstration of his insistence on the right to privacy Satoshi Nakamoto has remained anonymous for almost a decade - in a world where most people believe that the three letter agencies have an all-seeing eye from which no-one can hide.

For sure, taking out a loan that will repay itself is "productive" and adds value to the economy.
However, there are few instances of productive loans these days: buying a house - on credit - during a housing bubble does not add value to the economy, and many many bitcoin are bought via credit card for speculation - hoped-for future value that robs the economy now. Nevermind, the many parasitic "Bitcoin Businesses" that primarily deal in micro-transactions: extracting value from the blockchain without putting anything back - wasteful in their own right, and engaging customers in unproductive spending at high fees.

Block size is a parameter that determines:
- number of txns per period
- amount of data that needs to be moved around the network
- amount of data that needs to be processed by all nodes
- size of the blockchain 
- cost of running any node but, importantly, a validating full node
- ultimately, the security of Bitcoin
Hence, removing a sane cap on blocksize is not sensible. Szabo likens it to removing the temperature cap on nuclear reactors. Yes, the fuel rods output will increase, but the infrastructure housing them will malfunction. So, physical and design constraints that the engineers are best qualified to comprehend and make according decisions on. The public can study nuclear physics, but generally don't know enough about it to make design alteration calls.
Behind all of this, as Szabo implies, is the mistaken belief that more adoption leads to price increases. Hence, following on from this myth: if transaction capacity is boundless then price will go to the moon. The crucial insight missing from this belief is the Law of Induced Demand in large scale networks: increasing supply simply increases demand. That's OK for transport networks, but not for Bitcoin's fundamental characteristics of security and robustness.
Hence, SegWit and not a blocksize increase.

In a way, yes.
The dictionary definition of the term "inflation" has changed since 2000. Before then it meant an increase of money supply relative to the amount of goods and services in an economy. This is a causative description: increasing money supply relative to goods and services.
Nowadays, the dictionary defines "inflation" as an increase in the price of goods and services. This is a description of the *effect* of increasing money supply: that more money chases the same amount of goods/services - resulting in their price going up.
That's upside down logic! :)
Bitcoin could be described to be dis-inflationary, but that is defining it in terms of what it is not. Even the "what it is not" part is based on a false modern definition of inflation. Easier to say, I think, that it has a fixed money supply - then the price of consumer goods priced in BTC can fluctuate in the coming centuries  without us having to be committed to a twice-removed definition, eh?

fees are high because Bitcoin is in such high demand: users are paying higher and higher fees to try and get their transaction in the next block.
Nothing can realistically be done about it. The self-evident solution is to increase the size of blocks but this will degrade Bitcoin security and catalyze a runaway Induced Demand spiral. Without robust security, Bitcoin becomes meaningless.
During periods of low market activity, e.g. mid-2013, first half of 2015, fees tend to reduce because the fear inspired *must-transact-now-or-i'll-lose-out!* subsides.

Its a programmable money (contract mechanism) that makes irrelevant many of the 3rd party intermediaries that syphon value from citizens and economy alike; it allows us to directly agitate the the state and disrupt international banking business - and you want to buy coffee with it?
Does that make sense? A slow, expensive and unreliable payment network for an unproductive micro-transaction like coffee? That doesn't add value to the economy or put Bitcoin to its intended use at all.
Why would you give your bitcoin to Starbucks or Tesla? That's what fiat cash and credit cards are for, surely.
Bitcoin must be expensive because its not a free service, and its value proposition is very great indeed. Unless someone thinks its a trinket worth trading for coffee. Eh?


That's not the CS truth of it. Hashrate means little if hashrate operators can be bought by government or big business. Reducing the cost of running a fullnode and mining operation distributes the hashrate and decentralizes the network - reducing the risk of security breaches and providing contingency when it *does* happen.

There is no plan or option to cut out satellite banks with a central bank currency. You're still missing the sick point:
If only certain people could mine Bitcoin then it would be useless to us because we would be subject to their version of history (of transactions). They could change it at any time and no other miner could block their rewriting of the blockchain. They could decide to increase the amount of coins in circulation. No miner could block that because there is no active consensus mechanism.
The central bank blockchain offers citizens no participation and entrenches the satellite banks permanently, with a fraudulent mutable fiat blockchain. This is not experiment or in any way good for anyone except the authority of the central bank.

Think about it, activating SegWit won't end the scaling debate because we have factions with different visions for what Bitcoin should be. From the one faction's point of view the activation of SegWit will only serve to increase their ire and attacks against the (so perceived) SegWit "dystopia".
From the perspective of those who want to see the Bitcoin ecosystem in perpetual division, the forcing of SegWit signaling via UASF, represents a perfect opportunity to escalate the tension and attacks, because reactionaries love nothing more than an aggression to justify counter-attack.
Miners must do whatever they want to do. Its their economic prerogative. If they transgress patent law in the process, then they must deal with the law and the consequences.
Core cannot be seen to interfere with economics and markets because they are the technical custodians of Bitcoin - not its nanny or its dad or its equivalent of central bank policy makers.
Bitcoin is subject to Consensus rule. If 95% don't agree then any change (no matter how much emotion invested in it) is irrelevant. In the meantime, Bitcoin is doing just fine.

The point that I'm making is that manipulation of blocksize as a means of increasing capacity is not the solution, as supported by the research and evidence.
Of course we want to scale. I believe that there is consensus for scaling. You do not acknowledge that part of my comment. My argument is *not* that we shouldn't build more roads or more hospitals. In terms of Bitcoin that is the equivalent of adding more nodes - a "good thing". 
In terms of the Principle of Induced Demand, the suggestion is that widening *existing* roads and enlarging *existing* hospitals as a means of reducing their congestion does not work. Other, novel, solutions are needed.
For example, public roadway congestion can be addressed via improvement to public transit or bus provision. By incentivizing commuters with lower transportation costs, the existing capacity is put to better use, and the congestion measurably reduced.
Hence, SegWit provides a realignment of fee incentives,
and the introduction of additional protocol layers (e.g. mass transit) provides a more sustainable solution to scaling. The associated doubling of blocksize to 2MB is therefore justified.
We know that a series of blocksize increases, by itself, will not relieve the congestion and high fees permanently. This conclusion is supported by real world case studies and science. If someone can illustrate that the Principle of Induced Demand does not apply to the highly-in-demand Bitcoin network, then I am willing to accept that, rationally.

The article unpacks the chain-split that Bitcoin will face sooner or later. It cannot be delayed forever. Compromises and agreements cannot avoid the inevitable.
The Big-Block-Big-Adoption camp have rationalized it to themselves that the High-Security-Censorship-Resistant core are *bank-funded luddites* who want to deny the World of its Salvation from the Establishment. The Big-Block camp loudly declares these false accusations even as it prepares to implement, via a contentious and dangerous hard fork, the ill-conceived and technically undefined SegWit2x proposal of Barry Silbert, consultant to the Federal Reserve, and his "agreement" among pariahs such as Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and ~80 bank-satellite companies. The majority of these companies add little to no fundamental value to Bitcoin other than holding it momentarily before they convert it back to fiat.
To add insult to injury, Blockstream and Core developers were asked to sign the prepared "agreement" without being invited to discuss its contents. Silbert made a public statement that Core had been invited but declined to attend. A carefully worded statement that omits the pivotal fact. A lie.
Relentless Big-Block-Big-Adoption propaganda and slander serves to convince this camp that **breaking Consensus on this exceptional occasion is okay** because it is in the interest of rescuing Bitcoin from the *hostage-takers* Blockstream, Core and their Small Block orc armies.
The Big-Block-Big-Adoption camp's myth vision, their complete misunderstanding of the technology, their failure to verse their arguments in research or scientific rhetoric, and the regular emergence of populist leaders from their ranks - all of these behaviors have a strong analogue in [Cargo Cult](


This makes sense in the light of [Induced Demand]( While none of the Big-Block-Big-Adoption proponents have used the term, or referred to the phenomenon, it seems they are betting on this dynamic: that **latent demand will quickly fill additional blockspace**, thereby increasing usage, but soon suffering the **same congestion** and **same high fees**. And so, the next scheduled blocksize increase is dangled like a carrot before the market and the *"hundreds of new adopters complaining to Bitcoin.com every day about high fees and stuck transactions" (R. Ver)*.
Jihan Wu - and most miners - no-doubt, look forward to this version of the future while wringing their hands with glee.
Of course, this is the road to ever-weakening security and centralization that proponents of Bitcoin's Censorship Resistance cannot knowingly and willingly embark upon.


CR proponents, whether Cypherpunks or public advocates like Nick Szabo, Adam Back, or Core developers, know not to confuse price with value.


And such non-blockchains will find them, via central bank issued crypto fiat.
Some Big-Block-Big-Adoption proponents are well-meaning fools who are simply deluded by their myth vision - that by increasing blocksize fees can be reduced and the world's poor will be relieved of their poverty by the orange-and-white genie. Driven by this noble (but naive) vision their ignorance leaves them oblivious to the security implications of ramping up blocksize.
Others, quietly malicious, know exactly what a two-year schedule of blocksize doublings will do. They know that it will neither relieve congestion nor lower fees (except for a brief period after each increase). They know that it will at least double their revenue at each blocksize hike, and they know that it will systematically centralize their power in the network. ViaBTC has started planning their victory day [ICO](
That there are two camps with irreconcilable visions for Bitcoin should be obvious to anyone by now. 
If the Big-Block-Big-Adoption-Big-Price camp do not already represent a majority, then they soon will - within months or years. Misguided as their vision and reactionary style of achieving it might be, they are not going away and any reasonable person would argue that they should be afforded the freedom to make their dream come true - to pursue their dystopia.
However, let's not pretend or be falsely reconciliatory as we show them the door to pursue their folly: 
Bitcoin is a creation and a gift of the [Cypherpunks](
Cypherpunk Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin is not merely a payment network. It is programmable money, its use is permissionless and trustless by design. And its fundamental Cypherpunk characteristic is a censorship resistant blockchain. 
Satoshi Nakamoto specified his only golden rule for Bitcoin to be the *Rule of Consensus*.
A **Censorship Resistant Bitcoin will not be hijacked**.
CR-proponents cannot have it recorded in history that they handed Bitcoin to Consensus breakers and finance capital.
The Big-Block-Big-Adoption camp are free to fork the code, change the blocksize parameter, and **change their project's name to something other than Bitcoin**.
They must not be handed Bitcoin. If they want it, then they must be seen to take it by force, and in violation of the Rule of Consensus.

Good point: whenever coins are removed from circulation (e.g. lost or destroyed) this translates to an incremental increase in the value of the remaining coin base - money in circulation.

To move bitcoin from one address to another it must be transacted via the Bitcoin network. To incentivize miners to confirm your transaction you'll have to offer them a fee.
Unless Coinbase are willing to give you the private key of the address where they store your bitcoin, you'll have to pay the fee to send your bitcoin from the Coinbase account address to an address you control.
Even *if* Coinbase gave you that private key, you'll have to trust them to not spend your bitcoin because whoever holds the private key for an address can spend the coins held in that address.
Mining fees are calculated *per byte* of the transaction data and not according to the amount of bitcoin being sent. Hence, it makes sense to transact one large amount rather than several small amounts. For a single transaction of 0.5 BTC you'll pay, say, 0.002 BTC whereas you might end up paying five times 0.002 BTC if you send five separate transactions of 0.1 BTC each.
*Recommendation: don't buy bitcoin via an exchange that links your identity to Bitcoin and a bitcoin address. Use localbitcoins.com to buy bitcoin anonymously via cash.*

The definition of "micro-transaction" is open to interpretation, surely, since it is not defined in code?
Gambling sites seem to be a micro-transaction market, not true? As are all those "watch videos or solve captchas for bitcoin".
The definition of micro-transaction should shift with fees. If the prevailing fee rate is $1, then anything up to +/- 5 times that would make the transaction small in relation to the fee paid.
When prevailing fee is $5/tx then a tx amount worth $20 could be considered a micro-transaction, since it is inefficient in relation to the percentage fee being paid.


This is an explicit design feature of SegWit: that it optimizes block space usage by moving the tx witness out of the block. Each tx is therefore smaller, more txns can fit in a block, and the blockchain size increase decelerates by ~30%.
That is true and can be verified:

Blocks have been full and fees have been high for many many moons now.
1. The number of txns on the network and in mempool keeps increasing.
2. And still exchanges keep reporting increasing demand and record account applications.
The solution to these high fees, says the document, and the negative impact they're having on usability (see point 1 , above) and future prospects (2, above), is to double blocksize...
So, following the Law of Induced Demand (increased supply is quickly filled by demand), 2MB blocks will gift us double the txn throughput on the same network infrastructure (which hasn't been doubled in capacity) and the same high fees.
How is that a solution? 
Surely: 
- SegWit activation first - a year after signalling requirement is fulfilled (via MASF or UASF)
- SegWit optimises blockspace usage and network load
- second, HF to 2MB blocks?
And this sequence of events is exactly how the existing SegWit/2MB blocksize schedule is roadmapped. So, how is this "Safe 2MB Hardfork Proposal", and yet another round of signatures, in any way novel or useful  ?

Censorship resistance makes Bitcoin a political tool for some (activists, agitators) and a political problem for others (banks, state).

As opposed to saving bitcoin or productive bitcoin expenses, apparently, *unproductive spending* - at *high fee rates* - **is lucrative for both parasitic Bitcoin businesses and powerful rational miners**. 
Having a multi-year schedule of blocksize increases, the payees' evangelists can dangle a *"lower fees at the next blocksize increase!"* carrot to each new wave of on-chain micro-tx adopters - the latent demand that will quickly fill each capacity increase's additional space.

If someone woke up from a 20 year sleep and asked you or me about the major themes in society today, we'd mention Bitcoin, right? And if they listened to the concept and then asked "So, how's it doing?" there could be several answers:
- its doing fine - its gaining popularity month on month, year on year, transactions are high, fees are high, the price is high, its going to be scaling in a year from now...
- its in a mess, the community is divided, its about to fail as the most popular cryptocurrency, there's a bunch of bad actors who are  trying to derail it...
You see, neither description is absolutely correct or incorrect, its only that they represent a fundamental feature of human perception: there are those who are optimistic and hopeful, and there are those who find fault and see negative lurking in the cracks.
This is what splits parties, congregations, software projects, etc. Bitcoin is not free from this human aspect, but the open source development model and Bitcoin's rule of consensus means Bitcoin itself is immune to it.

Now that you've clarified that: Good article. My criticisms are only on those two points I mention - namely, the statement that Bitcoin is politically neutral, and the notion of seniority homage to early adopters and early developers - but that is a questionmark over the notion and not on your writing in this case.


Fair enough. We differ in our assessments of what is going on and disagree on this point. Yes, blockchain and Bitcoin has many useful aspects and lessons that could benefit society and finance. It should be implemented instead of the many redundant central authorities out there but they won't agree and go willingly. We can leave it there.


That's a bit harsh. We disagree but your stance makes it difficult to engage reasonably.


I'm not saying I am a Cypherpunk, and the Cypherpunks are not talking about overthrowing anything. So "anti-state" does not imply anarchism in this context. Anti-state refers to those states that deny citizens their right to privacy - which is just about every state in existence. Anti-state is not a condition that we choose but one that is forced upon us by monstrous surveillance, banning of encryption technology, and the fact that those who control the state have their privacy protected absolutely by the very same state that denies it to citizens! 
The tactic of Cypherpunks to agitate and evade the state is, amongst other things, what gave birth to Bitcoin. The designers and creators are cypherpunks, the earliest adopters are cypherpunks. Behind the scenes are cypherpunks. They didn't create and go away. They just remained out-of-sight all along. 
Bitcoin is a lot of things. It is everything you say and I am saying that it has an undeniable political character and utility because of where it came from.

Ask yourself, does Bitcoin do everything it should do according to your reading of the whitepaper?
Included in that understanding is the Rule of Consensus: if a proposed change has near-unanimous (~95%) support then implement it. If not, then leave Bitcoin be.
So, if you consider Bitcoin, in its present form, is *not* fulfilling the description in the whitepaper, then you can propose some changes provided they're still subject the rule of consensus.
If you believe Bitcoin is doing what is described in the whitepaper and SegWit would be useful, then great, Bitcoin is successful and once consensus allows SegWit then we can have that too.
However, if someone proposes we abandon consensus for a change and then return to consensus, they're fooling themselves with the exception, because they just set the precedent that could be used against them in future.
Of course, the consensus breakers on both sides of the fence are arguing that their unilateral aggression, on this one significant occasion, is only an exception.
Bottom line, and I'm trying to find the world-rocking urgency, is that Bitcoin works as intended, as it is right now. There is a lot of psychological investment in painting the current state of things as urgent when it is merely the natural progression of a new innovation. Business investment is less important, because we know this thing was invented by the cypherpunks for a revolutionary cause and not for some previously monied entrepreneur to get wealthy off of a innovation meant to disrupt (make irrelevant) both him and his favorite bank.
Bitcoin is running as per design. It's blockspace is scarce as a security measure. Anyone who would compromise security for profit is undesirable and dispensable to Bitcoin.

Every exchange is a satellite of the banking system, and every company in the Bitcoin space has a bank account, perhaps a bank loan or some other investors who are funded via banking capital. AXA happens to fund a lot of IT ventures and start-ups.
But to say that AXA *controls* Blockstream is baseless. To say that Blockstream developed SegWit or Lightning, just means you haven't been following (or participating in) the development; and that you haven't done your homework.
Lightning is a well-known layer 2 protocol, but there are many others. I participate in the development of a layer 2 protocol that has nothing to do with either Blockstream or Lightning. Layer 2 is just a protocol - its open - anyone can create L2 apps and protocols - they simply extend Bitcoin in a way that is more scalable - and without altering Bitcoin (layer 1).
So, not sure where you get the high fees and censored transactions from. Sounds like you're just flinging accusations without any base knowledge. Yes, the banks are central to the systemic failure of finance, but finance capital will continue to function with or without them - businesses need seed funding and investment to start/develop.

No, I'm not an expert but I had my mind oriented to Bitcoin private key security (by the video).
