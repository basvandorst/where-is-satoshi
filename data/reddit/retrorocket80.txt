2019 military budget is 576 billion, 13% of our spending, which I agree is pretty high, we could probably cut that in half.  We're going to spend 2.8 TRILLON on just 3 entitlement programs in 2019, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, accounting for over %60 of all US spending.... So please, tell us more about how impactful those jets to bomb brown people are to our budget.  If we literally disbanded the ENTIRE fucking US military tomorrow, and had to depend on fucking Canada for our Defense and force projection on the world stage we couldn't even cover 1/5th of our Entitlements budget this year.  That guy may very well be an asshole, but you're an idiot, and I'd much rather deal with an asshole over an idiot 9/10 times.

Today I learned that liking someone despite their faults is a cult, better tell my spouse that she's a guru and not to abuse her power.  I love Trump, I love bitcoin and it's redonkulus to think that I have to make a choice between the two.  I wish that POTUS was pro crypto, but I'm not really shocked that he's not.  Also since when did the President have to be an expert in every field and infallible? He's a leader, not a God.  The people constantly trying to tear him down are the worst type of little beta males and it shows.  They hate that he's rich, fucks supermodels, and says and does whatever the fuck he wants at all times.  A feat they can only minimally accomplish from behind the anonymity of  their keyboard.
TLDR: Will support Trump, will continue to buy bitcoin, haters be little bitch bois.

The Army's entire budget for 2019 was  191 Billion, an all time high.
"Broken down by department, $205.6 billion goes to the Navy, a $9.95 billion increase from FY19; $204.8 billion goes to the Air Force, an $11.8 billion increase; $191.4 billion goes to the Army, a $12.5 billion increase; and $116.6 billion goes to defense wide efforts, a decrease of $930 million. "
So you're telling me that you believe that the Army somehow "misplaced" 6500 billion dollars in 2015, which is the equivalent of 34 years of its annual budget at current levels.  This is an accounting error, plain and simple, no real money was lost.

Please cite some other examples about a financial instrument since the adoption of fiat currency, the removal of the gold and silver standards and the rise of fractional reserve banking, that had the potential to shake things up the way bitcoin can.  Tulip mania? For starters, the fact that it has been widely debunked as a non event that was nothing more than a blip on the radar of the Dutch economy, and its a potted plant.  Jesus,  tulip mania is about as significant an economic event as the popularity of Beanie Babies or the pet rock of the 60s.  The audacity of you to compare early bitcoin investors to peasants, please.  Go sell the wine from your sour grapes, because no one here is going to buy your fucking bullshit.

I posted that off the cuff while taking my morning shit and was barely awake. Probably came off more rude than intended, and the post was more for entertainment than substance.  I have no stress man, check my post history, made several bitcoin purchases between 1700-2500 ish and I still hold those coins.  Bitcoin has been nothing but a joyful windfall and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.  I am invested in other things that are not related to crypto, quantum computing is very exciting, Boston Dynamics robots.  I just get tired of hearing about tulip mania, because I feel like people want to think smart investments are just gambling and getting lucky, because they want to discount foresight and raw guts.   Sorry you didn't get in at that price, sometimes its hard to pull the trigger, there are other opportunites out there, and if you put half as much energy into seeking out those, and analyzing them as you do trying to have insight into the psychological motivations of random bitcoin HODLrs on the Internet, you can do well.  Good luck to you and Merry Christmas!

You guys are brave and I respect you, due to bitcoin's quick success most of us bought in at or near an all time high,  my buys were between 1600-2500 and there were plenty of ups and downs along the way and I was nervous, you will be too.  You will wonder if you were too late, if FUD is real, what the next fork will bring.  Please just invest the money you are willing but to lose 100%.  It's the only way you'll sleep at night.

Steven is wrong unfortunately, falling oil prices mostly due to the US turning to a higher percentage of domestic oil and energy production from shale and fracking and new technologies in those areas is responsible.  Socialism built on oil production is not exactly a stable economy.

So showing the reality of their situation in Venezuela is propaganda?  I would just call it reporting the unfortunate facts and letting people draw their own conclusions.  Sounds like you're pretty happy with your Nordic Neo Liberal Democratic Socialism.  I guess that the propaganda didn't remove your ability to think for yourself and form an opinion!
I wonder though, if the socialism in your country is so great and safe and good, why do you feel the need to own bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:20:06
Disagree with you there, it will just create a ton more debt which will result in further devaluation of our currency.  Progressive politics in the US really just consists of giving away money in exchange for votes.  Probably works differently in your country, so you're probably hoping for something that will look vastly different when implemented here versus there.  
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:50:49
Unfortunately it's probably a quantum mechanics type situation.  Now that they're aware of the situation it will collapse.  They're affecting it by measurement. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:10:24
It's not, Capitalism is fine but we have huge national debt from too much social welfare to buy progressive politicians votes and fiat currency that went off the Gold Standard 50 years ago.  We're in a pretty precarious position here, and bitcoin is my hedge against runaway inflation like Zimbabwe or Venezuela.  The problem is that if the US economy collapses or has large scale problems like the ab countries, it's going to be felt throughout the world.
Glad that you're experimenting with crypto for laughs, but my interest is purely from an asset protectionist point of view.

Trump is amazing, and I used to be a Democrat.  Voted for Obama's first term.  Look past what what a corrupt media is telling you about him and look a little deeper.  I'm probably going to regret asking this but since we're not in one of the standard political forums, I'm going to risk it.  What exactly is it that you don't like about the man, and how has any of his policies specifically worsened your quality of life?  Be specific.

We don't talk about the Bitcoin all that much because I wanted to buy in cheaper, and for a lot more than what our position ended up being and I think she feels foolish and I'm a bit salty that I didn't put my foot down to tell you the truth.  I went from millionaire potential to likely enough potential gains to pay off the mortgage and send my Daughter to college free of charge though, so its tough to complain.  Bitcoin has not and probably will not change my life, but it certainly is going to help out a lot and make me feel like a genius for believing when I did.
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:59:46
I did the same thing, bought in at the current ATH of 2500ish after kicking myself for not buying in at 1600 (due to spousal pressure).  It of course promptly went down, but I HODL like a champ due to mostly this sub's advice and belief in the tech and I'm pretty happy with where things are headed.  Just HODL.  Try to resist price check 10x a day for the first months, but just HODL.

I meant BTC and just screwed up the abbreviation.  I switched my BCH to BTC when it was like 1700 / 5500 or so, thought I got the best ratio that was actually tradable.  Tried when it spiked truly high but my trades would not execute there was so much traffic.

Again, Myspace is a social networking website, not the newest form of transactions since we left the barter system.  Trying to apply any from logic to this thing isn't comparing apples to oranges, its like trying to compare apples to solid state rocket boosters headed to the moon.  Also currencies can coexist, and already do.  US dollar being king doesn't mean Japan yen is worthless.  It may not stay on top compared to any other crypto, but the market will find relative equilibrium over time.  Digital money is here to stay, and I think that the chance BTC goes below 5k again are about as likely as it being 100k next year.  The truth will be something in between.  Most of this FUD is sour grapes from people who missed the boat due to their own egos.

I honesty believe that the forks and drama have helped BTC because it proves resilience in the face of conflict.   I think this uptrend IS reflecting some of that increased confidence amongst retail buyers and institutional investors both.  Though anybody who believes that they have a handle on what is really going on is just guessing, myself included.

I'm clearly in the minority here but I liked the troll box because day trading shitcoins and staring at charts is pretty boring, and sometimes you could pick up a legit tip or two based on what people seemed to be getting excited about.  I will be moving to another exchange because honestly the troll box was one of the best features of Poloniex, that shit is laggy as hell and the charting isn't the best.

Man I wish... I'm regreting the hell out of not getting in literally a month ago @ 1600 because I was on vacation and couldn't be bothered by it at the time.  Also I was waiting for that "dip back to 900" because you know....bubble.

I think that's what the above poster is trying to say.... This isn't necessarily a spike... When the real dollar price gets this high small percentage swings seem like a lot to most people. It's like a 3-5% move. Saw another post saying it's about the same as going from 27$-29$. Same percentage and nobody was concerned with that movement.

Honestly I don't even think it was 3 days.  Maybe 18 hours?

That was an interesting thread to read. Crazy to think that was only 4 years ago.  I need to HODL harder.

Right but 15% for what exactly? At least with income / sales / property taxes I can see where they are going and the services they are paying for.  How is capital gains tax justified when I am taking all the risk? Is the government going to subsidize my losses by 15% if I invest it all in shitcoins and lose? I mean I guess if I was "too big to fail" they would.  Really though, I find capital gains hard to justify.

I think you overestimate institutional investors reliance on TA as a tool.  Nobody with a functional brain stem believes that nonsense.  You may as well invest based on your horoscope or read tea leaves.

But the technical ANALysis says we're supossed to go down :(

Wait until current price hits 10k sell half, pay off your mortgage and enjoy your windfall, don't tell anyone about it.  When your kid hits college age sell some more and pay for that.  Always hold on to a little.

The fact that you even can comprehend the concept of a reverse Dunning-Kruger probably puts you in the top 10%.

It's risky if you are in the habit of betting your mortgage money or child's college fund.  If you're not a fucking dumbass and throw in a few thousand you're not going to miss then now is a great time to buy.

There was a $400-500 dollar correction over the weekend.  If you haven't bought the bottom in the 3-5k range I feel for you.

Slavery is alive and well in 2017, it's just called Visa / Mastercard. So as much as I hope to make a little money on this Bitcoin thing even though I'm late to the party, I really hope this helps take the shackles off the middle class.

Bought some at like 2500 didn't sell at 19k, didn't sell at 3k on the way down, not selling now.  I told myself when I bought them that I would sell half sometime after the next halving when it felt right, then another half after the next halvening, etc.  It's been tough riding the UPS and downs but I'm as hard as they come now.

It's still early enough to make 100x or 1000x profits over the long term.  Invest whatever amount you will NEVER miss, lock it up in a hardware wallet and foret about it for a decade.
