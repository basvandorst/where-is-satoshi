The KYC regulations do not have a minimum amount associated with them - if you're selling bitcoin for fiat then technically you have to be running KYC. Our service would be useful to you (as well as necessary unless you want to be doing verifications yourself) and you could absolutely manage everything through the dashboard. The key point is that you shouldn't sell anything until *before* you run an identity check on the person you're selling to.

Correct, no worries there!
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:17:02
Any left?

Good questions - so what we currently do is individual identity verification in the United States (not investors or businesses yet) meaning when somebody wants to sign up for something like an exchange, we verify that they are who they say they are.
We're in the middle of determining the exact guarantees we can make, but off the record the goal is to make it so that as long as the API is implemented correctly on your end, you shouldn't have to worry about KYC anymore just like how Stripe make PCI compliance practically nonexistent for their customers.
We hash and salt highly sensitive information like social security numbers and run penetration testing software against the app. And then of course the standard procedures like SSL are implemented too.

Because it's in our terms of service &amp; privacy policy that we won't. So that means that if we do, you have every right to sue us and you would more than probably win. We also are not acting under pseudonyms or anything like that - we're very public about who we are on the website, so there's no hiding. In fact, my username is my real name!

Yes, sorry about that, we did not want the site to be posted this early. We were planning to post it when we're out of private beta.
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:51:27
Yes, exactly.
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:00:36
We did not create that post, actually. It was most likely somebody who saw this thread.

Surprised to see somebody posted this. We have some interesting stuff coming out over the next few months, so I encourage you to sign up for our mailing list on the bottom of the page. There are some papers and analyses in the pipeline as well as some cool open source projects.

As I said in another comment, sorry about this, we didn't want the site to be posted so soon. We were planning to post it when we're out of private beta when there is more public information.

Sure, so to be clear, for the time being, the actual verification is the same. Most companies verify scanned documents or ask questions based on public records but we use social security numbers to provide the best accuracy. We have many more plans regarding fraud prevention that can *only* be done using bitcoin and we will get to that soon - this is just our first step. However, this is not the important part.
Ignoring our future bitcoin-specific features which I won't get into yet, I think we still have a compelling case:
* Both we and our lawyers know bitcoin very well. We understand the environment and can provide support accordingly.
* You can be guaranteed we won't start turning away bitcoin-related companies in the future due to political reasons as we've seen with a bunch of other traditional financial companies.
* The sales cycles of the current big guys doing verifications are very opaque. No public prices, API documentation, etc. You have to call up before you're told anything about the system and you can bet that they'll be price discriminating based on your answers to their questions.
* We're making client libraries for systems people use today like ruby/rails, PHP and node.
* Our API is really fresh - fully RESTful JSON using modern authentication methods. You're going to see a lot of XML and SOAP with the other guys.
* My co-founder and I are both programmers and will understand where you're coming from if you need anything. BlockScore is inherently developer-friendly.
I hope this answers your question!
