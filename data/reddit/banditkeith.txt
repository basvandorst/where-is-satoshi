it's been an amazing ride. i remember the week leading up to the 1800$ peak price, i couldn't stop checking the price waiting until the right moment to cash out and then wait for the drop to buy more. it really is like being at the craps or blackjack table, if you know what you're doing and play safe you can make some money, and if you don't you're going to lose big.

It took me a minute to realize you were drying your shoes with hot air from mining hardware. I was very confused

5 passes of random data from roadkills disk eraser utility is good enough for the atlantic lottery corporation, and they're(understandably) paranoid about protecting against data leaks.

Short answer,  no. 
Long answer, the kinds of total overhaul you're talking about will never happen. New technology enters the fray as an addition to existing technology and protocols, not a direct replacement. legacy protocols and technology often continue to be supported on an infrastructure level for years or even decades after their replacements roll out. There are government departments still relying on mainframes from the 70s, and equipment from companies like DEC who haven't even existed for over a decade. And really, the only way the Internet as a whole could be changed to negatively affect bitcoin is if technology were put in place that deliberately interfered with the blockchain. Even that would be damn near impossible since as long as the traffic was encrypted there would be no surefire way of knowing what packets to interrupt. For more information, consult your local library or systems administrator.

It's mostly a high end restaurant gadget in North America, but some German and polish expats have brought it to the attention of general consumers in Ontario. The guy who did the demo was a nice dude, I felt bad I didn't end up getting one because his demo was spot on and he was really friendly.
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:19:07
nah, the guy who gave the demo was polish, he worked for the canadian distributor.

Looks like a nice blender. The Thermomix is a similar piece of high end kitchen gear, and having sampled the output of that, it can make a damn fine tuna pate or cucumber dill soup.

But they can make you open a locked door if they have a warrant to search the other side. In this case, the hard drive is the locked door and the password is the key. You can't refuse to let the cops search a locked room by claiming fifth amendment means you don't have to open a locked door if doing so will let them see incriminating evidence. And as the ruling on his appeal states, this is a case of forgive conclusion. They know from testimony that he has child porn, so they compelled decryption of his drive so they have access to the evidence in a usable form, and by refusing he's in contempt of court.
It's not like this opens any dangerous precedents, they had a body of evidence already that justified access to the hard disk. they can't just demand you decrypt a secure volume without justification or you stay in jail forever. They still need probable cause

he's canadian, so no right to bear arms pal, ownership of firearms is a privilege in canada, not a right. and if they have a warrant, they don't need permission to enter to investigate the possibility he's violated a weapons possession ban, which he clearly had. attacking police carrying out a warrant, who are already concerned you are armed and dangerous, is unwise.
and canada is hardly a police state. maybe fact check and consider reality before you spew nonsense about a mentally unstable, violent man who tried to kill people who were just doing their job. i wish bitcoin didn't draw out so many crazy, anarchist, hippie weirdos. it's paranoid people like you who glorify nutcases like this that are impediments to wider acceptance.

Hard to feel bad for someone who attached an officer with a crossbow, which he was prohibited from owning due to being under a ten year weapons ban. Also, storing firearms loaded the way he had previously is an asshole move, so many accidental firearms fatalities occur because some irresponsible idiot left the gun loaded. He may have been a good coder and continue to the Bitcoin ecosystem, but he sounds irresponsible, unstable and untrustworthy. I feel bad for his kids losing their dad, that's a shitty thing to have happen, but he sounds crazy.
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:00:56
yeah, no. you sound nuts. ownership of firearms is not a fundamental human right. that you consider it so, and that any country that limits it is a police state, sounds paranoid and ludicrous.
the americans only have the right to bear arms because of specific elements of their history, and it's unfortunate that so many crazy right wingers cling to an outdated constitutional amendment that's just a holdover from post colonial era politics. i don't want paranoid nutcases, who post insane racist diatribes online, to be allowed to have guns.

i picked deepbit at random, i stuck with them because i'm getting 1BTC per ~3 days at 160MH/s and i'm hesitant to switch to another pool where my potential income will likely be lower
if there's another pool i could expect comparable returns, i'd seriously consider switching though, given the insecurity of 1 guy having so much processing power at his command

I still kick myself for not investing every penny at my disposal when Bitcoin tanked from ten dollars to three. I could have converted about eight or nine thousand dollars into Bitcoin. That would have been three thousand Bitcoin, which when we peaked this week at 2800 that would be almost nine million dollars in my wallet. I could retire and live a comfortable life, if I'd taken that risk.
@_date: 2011-06-09 01:55:23
definitely going to use this service. as a canadian, i was wondering how best to sell my bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:54:09
I'd be converting it into land, building materials, and buy as much as I could online in Bitcoin. It'd be nine million dollars in buying power.

Hi, I know this is an old post, but are you still willing to do prints for btc? I need someone to print the parts for the delta-pi reprap and airtrippers bowden extruder, i've in the process of building one and the printed parts are the only thing i don't have a source for at this point
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:30:10
coindl looks pretty good. i'm looking into them, and if everything works out i think we'll be selling through them. thanks for the recommendation

3d printer parts and supplies, arduino kits and some steam codes. And soon another pile of printer supplies courtesy of the big price gains and some bitcoin from selling some old handheld games when bitcoin was only 120$ each

i've gathered up all the stl files and have them labeled with what they are and how many of each need printing, if you want i can email you an archive with all the files, and you can see how much you would want to print and ship them.
