come nov?
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:53:54
like, is there a short amount of miners at the moment? I heard news about how everyone switched to bitcoin cash and all.. idk
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:40:01
I rode a bike to the gas station and bought a $32 amazon gift card and traded it to the guy on localbitcoins.. lol
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:56:31
Do you recommend on holding onto btc during segwit? Im thinking of buying btc over the course of these couple days.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:41:41
Im so confused sorry :(
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:57:09
so until btc mining is profitable again, the fees are going to be high?
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:03:53
so for now should i use alt coins?
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:55:32
so basically: bitcoin cash mining was more profitable to mine than bitcoin core, and for that reason bitcoin core a small number of miners, which makes the fees very large?
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:48:00
Community guidelines:  Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
Sorry, I hope God opens a path in your life!
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:48:51
ok i know HODL means holding, but whats the real meaning :p
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:25:12
Theyre people who ask questions
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:18:04
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:00:04
So basically say i had $100 btc before august 1. Then the split happened. Will i have $200 in total? $100 btc and $100 bch?
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:54:30
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:42:33

Yea but its out of stock. That on amazon is 4k..
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:30:35
I choose to ask questions on reddit. Leave if u dont like it
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:40:00
A decent miner is $4k~
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:15:17
Im trying to buy her something expensive from stores such as chanel. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:47:34

@_date: 2017-09-11 05:06:09
Closest is an hour away :/ i still have my permit
@_date: 2017-10-11 02:56:02
Because most people think that the days of becoming a bitcoin millionaire is over and the price is too high for someone to buy btc
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:19:51
Alright thanks i guess
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:39:34
I wanna be 18 already :(
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:56:54
How tf is it illegal lmao theyre profiting from their own business. Its basically saying a puppy breeder bred 100 german sheperds and didnt sell them and all of a sudden raised their price by a $100 because he wants to get a profit because of the limited quantity. Example.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:16:29
Sent $20 wht now?
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:31:13
Yes. A company taking over bitcoin is possibly a very bad idea..
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:12:14
I dont live in philly
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:10:00
Omg let me see if it works!! Thanksss
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:56:34
Bro just transfer ur old wallet, and wipe the old computer with apps such as Eraser
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:54:39
Does it change my btc into bch?
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:07:13
Ah, does he have a website
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:26:27
To buy 10 trillion dollars
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:03:02
So basically i get free money?
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:09:14
Sadly i dont have friends my age that know about bitcoin :(
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:07:01
The fees are way too much. For every $100 i get 60-70$
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:46:09
Exodus uses the highest fee option there is
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:14:39
I use exodus
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:29:26
Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:11:03
Nah to avoid the exchanges. I will be paying a bit extra
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:53:09
Nah i actually switched to btc and ltc right before the price explode and made a good 10k
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:48:54
Isnt bitcoin the main power?? Why tf do people like bch. Can it be considered as another alt coin?
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:04:34
So say i use the thing on exodus to get the bch and send it to an exchange, will i still be able to use my btc properly?
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:25:31
You can buy gift cards via Gyft
@_date: 2017-09-11 19:55:06
So does it exchange my btc for bch?
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:12:05
Nah i want an exchange similar to what i am talking about where i can sell my btc for "wallet $" and keep it on the exchange and not cash out via debit or credit so it doesnt need my liscense, ssn, etc
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:13:52
Bitfinex is the way to go tbh :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 06:48:54
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:01:26
They didnt have the keys so they couldnt be accessed.. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:12:13
I cant find the store where i am planning on buying the gift :((
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:07:07
Is it loaded with 1 whole bitcoin? What
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:19:42

@_date: 2017-09-11 19:40:44
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:10:15
By the way since i am underage, are there any exchanges i can use? Like an exchange similar to paypal. I deosit my btc there, sell it, gain $100, but it stays in my exchange wallet and it doesnt fluctuate like btc and i can rebuy btc again and send it back to my wallet without any id or verification? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:50:41
Yes. Electrum is one of the most secure btc wallet service for computers. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:32:14

@_date: 2017-10-04 19:21:35

@_date: 2017-10-14 11:11:55
Yea its been a glitch lately. If u have another computer, log in to it and open the ledger bitcoin app from there and check on the new computer. Happened to me. I was scared that i lost 1.3k because my transaction wasnt showing up but on the blockchain it said it was confirmed so i was shitting myself for a whole day till i tried on a new computer and my coins showed.
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:11:12

@_date: 2017-10-09 20:24:57
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:47:47
Isnt bitcoin supposed to be a free currency? If you dont support it you dont want btc to be a free market/economy currency. Youre just here for the profit. Gtfo

@_date: 2017-10-02 04:41:00
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:24:14
The ledger is just a device that stores ur keys. U can use the ledger on electrum. U dont have to use ledgers software. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:30:25
