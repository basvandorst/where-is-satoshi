Pretty much anybody can tax anything. The government can tax bitcoin, the bigger issue is whether it would be effective. It would be more difficult to audit bitcoin than dollars
It's unlikely that the dollar will be no more and that bitcoin would take its place, it's not in a governments best interest to have an unregulated currency

Now I understand why people call the bitcoin community dense and unfriendly

No, MtGox is stopping withdrawals from their exchange, not your personal wallet. People think they are doing this because MtGox does not have the bitcoins they say they do.

If they didn't repay anybody, they would fail as an exchange, and nobody would use them. Right now they are just trying to put bandaids on the problem, saying its a problem with Bitcoin and not themselves. There is a lot of money to be made as an exchange, so it's in their best interest to stay in the game as long as possible.

I think the real Satoshi is one of those genius humble types, and was happy to disappear in 2010 once bitcoin started picking up. That's why it was such a surprise earlier today when he came back, but I think it's just because he wants to protect an innocent person from being hassled.

Bitcoin was essentially created when the scientific paper on bitcoin was released, authored by a satoshi nakamoto
That Satoshi Nakamoto is essentially the creator of bitcoin, but nobody really knows if he exists or who he is.

Isn't this the first time a singular person has been hassled to this extent by the media? The real Satoshi most likely would not want an innocent person to be put into this situation

I had the same feeling when I was planning to buy at 190, but I overslept one day and my bank closed. Next day, I grudgingly bought at 250. But look where we are now!

Could you elaborate on the scamming? I would have thought doing everything local would be very safe.

You just said the seller tried to cancel within minutes of you finding your error. It appears as if he was not scamming you, since the price didn't change within minutes of the transaction. He was likely edgy about the situation, with a buyer possibly scamming him. You clearly did not follow the localbitcoin policy with your error.

At this point, we are far into the drop and convincing many panic sellers to sell. It's unknown what the price will stabilize to - we could be under or over the correction by this point. I would recommend you hold for now, the prices will recover (slowly), and is safer than panic selling now.

Why would they release the 12.7? In your messages you stated you would only accept the 13.

No, the BTC was changed to reflect the buyer's late payment. The buyer sent payments at different times - 5000 AUD within the time limit, 2367 AUD hours later after the time limit, and after the prices of bitcoins had changed. The BTC had increased in price, so the buying power of 2367 AUD is lower, reducing the 13 BTC to 12.7 BTC.
If LocalBitcoins allows this late payment stuff to happen, it could easily be abused by people. Start a transaction, delay payment for hours, if the price goes up, then send payment and profit. If the price goes down, don't send payment.

This is a great idea, but just about everyone in here already has bitcoins or is already interested. Tip outside this sub and spread the word!
