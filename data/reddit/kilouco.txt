Thank you all for the tips.
I have studied a lot about bitcoin on the technical field (I'm a programmer myself). But I fail to understand perfectly the economics behind it. Also, I know that practice is never like theory, so I might as well start short, investing tiny amounts like a few hundred dollars to start.

Is it easy to play around with aggressive exchanges using coinbase? Are not the taxes prohibitive?

Thanks for the tips! Any names you'd recommend that I keep an eye on?

I've seen the mining productivity will be halved this year... wouldn't that mean, based on Economics principles, a rise in price?

My Public Key is:
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:35:40
I have banking, credit card, PayPal and even Social Security in the United States for I have lived and worked here for one year a while ago. So I thought they wouldn't mind. But, apparently, I need to prove residence in the country.
I don't know what doesn't sound legit. I partially regret purchasing from Coinbase, but won't complain until the coins become available (it was a Wire Transfer) and I see if I have control over moving them around.
In the meanwhile, to ease my paranoia, I will be hoping someone agrees to help me under certain conditions we can discuss... including paying with PayPal or wire transfer.

It'd be simple if I had the full control over my wallet, but since I bought from an Exchange, I still have to go through sending to move it out from my account into my personal wallet.
Problem is it's still pending, which means I don't yet have the coins, so I cannot test "sending".
Once they become available, I'll be abroad (for no return in years). Coinbase doesn't support the country where I'll be so I'll be locked from buying and selling. What I'm feeling anxious to know is if I still can send/receive cryptocoins even though I cannot sell and buy.
Got it?
Edit: I have already been blocked from buying and selling, because I don't have a U.S. ID, only an ID from my Country. They required that I validated my info. I did it and became blocked with "buy/sell not available in your country". That's why I'm so nervous right now.

That's the problem. I currently don't own any coins. If I could receive the smallest fraction and test the send/receive it'd be nice. I'll explain why I'm so worried:
I bought Bitcoins from Coinbase and I'm waiting for the wire transfer from my banking account to complete. While waiting, I became really paranoid that I would not be able to send/receive in Coinbase due to the fact that I''ll no longer be in the United States when the transaction completes and I'll be unable to move the coins because my destination country is not currently supported by CoinBase. I have tried contacting their support team but heard that they received so many new customers in the past few weeks that they are overwhelmed with tickets to solve.
