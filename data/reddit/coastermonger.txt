As a private service they're allowed to ask you to verify your ID before deciding if you can be trusted to use it.  Just like when you go to open a bank account in the states they may ask you for your ID.

RBF makes sense only if it enforces the same output addresses.  Otherwise you have an inferior payment system where anyone can charge back on any unconfirmed payment, and it requires centralized 3rd party services to fix.  
Don't forget, altcoins would have a heyday.  I would much rather accept a cryptocurrency that I knew had as little chance as possible of charging back, than use one which could disappear in 10 minutes

To play devil's advocate, this card allows me to hang on to bitcoin as a normal source of funds and then spend it on everyday purchases when needed. 
Without a bitcoin debit card, I have to keep a large portion of my savings in fiat for whatever might come up. 
These cards are a bridge that lets more people hang on to more bitcoin, it's only a matter of time before merchants see the advantage to take bitcoin directly.

Good article!
I think the answer is yes, and they should be killing it.  Credit/Debit cards essentially require fees because they operate on the backs of an expensive, inefficient, and overstayed payment network.  
While card payment terminals are nearly ubiquitous and potentially attractive for the cryptocurrency consumer, bitcoin doesn't need these middleman costs to operate.   
The wave of change should continue with merchants realizing it's beneficial to take bitcoin directly, pairing with a payment processor if they want to.

One option to consider is paper wallets protected by BIP 0038 secured passwords.  Anyone can look at the public and private key, but without knowing your password they would be unable to spend funds there.

Coinbase and Netflix partnering up makes sense
**Netflix would like it because:** 
1) The payment can't charge back
2) They reduce their liability because they're not storing as many sensitive pieces of user payment info
3) They pay *less* in fees than traditional methods and end up with more USD than a credit card payment could give them
4) The USD payment clears very quickly (ACH transfer within 24 hours)
5) Netflix can auto-cashout, meaning they lock in the payment with no market volatility in the price.
6) Coinbase support takes care of the customer questions/troubleshooting
7) Netflix gets access to recurring payment models 
8) They also get access to the million+ users who already use it as an online wallet.
**Consumers would like it because:**
1) They're no longer supporting or participating in a system that charges them to store, send, or receive money.  
2) Bitcoin is universal and available to people who may not have access to paypal or credit cards (you don't have to fill out applications or get approved to own/spend bitcoin.)
3) They're helping a merchant by using less expensive payment options, and Netflix may very well choose to pass on some of the savings if they perceive the benefits to be great enough.

Are you sure?  I was under the impression that users could transmit something that looks like a signed redeem script.  Here's a very simple example using 2-of-2:
* Address 1: 1MXb9WgHdzXTJrnJsGoe4dnwrZMkV68YUY
* Public Key 1: 049f7b4be3556ea0ebaed4c8e35cb55a50518409a9532278e5ecc8d0f42c5f026b562d7215d4c3523c51fd083051b3ad2d1c30454e2f7f216cf0aad4a5813b69e6
* Private Key 1: 5JjaHyQFN1xtLeBnYsztik7HmkKwGtdLg6JBvK7Fes32z9zPr5h
* Address 2: 13dyVYtNPWqz43Zrv8Nr4YmiS82dk5rCD4
* Public Key 2: 0484377cd308bb23b5f7fddeee0a106c235fe5da6a10ba06fbd4446102583f39d40f64d3b7493801867e41da1ae5da776c4efec6d321224d47fd0488fc4fa0b3be
* Private Key 2: 5KGYoNG72kTSuUywUbwMLwLS5sxFehahsUUvMk2dhRAG9u28Hox
The above yields a public multi-sig address of: 3N6rTTpWHMJcgz63wxQUUQKgnhfR51xhRV
And a redeem script of: 5241049f7b4be3556ea0ebaed4c8e35cb55a50518409a9532278e5ecc8d0f42c5f026b562d7215d4c3523c51fd083051b3ad2d1c30454e2f7f216cf0aad4a5813b69e6410484377cd308bb23b5f7fddeee0a106c235fe5da6a10ba06fbd4446102583f39d40f64d3b7493801867e41da1ae5da776c4efec6d321224d47fd0488fc4fa0b3be52ae
IIRC, adding a private key + redeem script + transaction spend details yields a longer precursor redeem script that you can't derive a private key from correct?  It should be safe to share this among connected wallets or parties so that they can verify it's correct, but they still can't derive your private key from it.

This is good content and effort, but it also may be way too technical and long to interest a newcomer.
Just start by addressing the basics including the problems that bitcoin solves.  Payments arrive instantly and confirm in minutes.  There are no chargebacks.  It's a secure system good enough for the likes of Dell, Overstock, Newegg, Wikipedia, Dish, etc, and companies like Coinbase and Bitpay take the volatility out of the equation.
Better yet, just send him some BTC and let him see for himself.

You make a lot of claims based off of some inconclusive and assumed information.  Here's your logic so far. 
1.) BECAUSE Bitcoin has a market cap of 10 billion (It doesn't. It's currently 7.7 billion, source: 
2.) AND Overstock had "only" 1 million in sales after a month. (non-contentious claim)
3.) THEREFORE (stat pulled out of air) maybe 10 million worth of bitcoins were spent to make purchases in the last month (contentious claim)
4.) THEREFORE (10 mil/10bil ) This activity is only 0.1% of bitcoins market cap
(So what? do you know what [market cap actually means?  You can't estimate economic activity by dividing total sales by a market cap.](
5.) THEREFORE: 99% of people holding bitcoins must be holding it because they want to make money with it.  (The math is wrong again, but I wouldn't necessarily dispute this claim.)
6.) THEREFORE everyone holding bitcoins must be willing to sell them if offered some fiat price.  (I'd agree with this too.  Everyone would probably be willing to sell any commodity for the right price.  Like $100 for a bottle of water)
7.) THEREFORE all cryptocurrencies are a ponzi scheme (Nope lol.  Markets, how do they work?)
I'm just going to stop here.  You lost me at ponzi scheme.  Bitcoin is just a tool, and no one is forcing/requiring you to use it.  If you don't/can't/shouldn't use it, have a nice day.

How about you don't have to pay anyone to store your bitcoins because it's free?  The days of paying people to hold/transfer your money are coming to a close.  Coinbase sits at the conversion point to switch between fiat and BTC, and that's the smart place to be.
@_date: 2014-03-06 04:45:39
You can try to do so, but you need my 1st password to even attempt a broadcast.  Without it, it's not possible to spam the precursor network with attempts to spend my coins because the clients will reject it as invalid.  The 2-of-2 transactions are standard, but you can split them up into x-of-y components before the final piece is forwarded off to the bitcoin blockchain. 
Additionally, the precursor network doesn't have to be "mined" and it can drop attempts after a period of time.   This means no extra fees or waiting times are required, you simply access a second device where you can enter the 2nd half of the password, comfortably ensuring that the first device never saw it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:35:31
Very aware of this thanks.  These tools help, but running to a hosted website for each new spend or multi-sig address shouldn't be the end-all solution for bitcoin users.  
Instead, it should be possible to design a locally run wallet with a simple user interface that can easily split up the control over multiple devices.  
One person + trustless and local multi-device authentication = major security improvement.

You're conflating two unrelated statistics.  The roughly 3600 BTC per day creation rate is the innate block reward during this current ~4 year era.  No one is paying for this, it's just how the code is programmed to release coin control and will be reduced by half each era.

The 2nd alt-coin was namecoin, which appeared by april 2011 and was built with the sha-256d algo.
Tenebrix was one of the first scrypt coins, appearing in September 2011, but it was pre-mined.  Litecoin was a derivative of that, appearing in October 2011.  
On the more recent portions of the map you may notice that Litecoin gave birth to a huge host of other alt-coin projects, mostly because at the later stages developers didn't want their coins to be immediately overpowered by those with asics.

The loss of the MtGox exchange may indeed be a necessary evolutionary step in bitcoin's growth cycle.  However, to argue that it's account holders must necessarily bear the full cost of it's failure is cynical, and has no place in this discussion. 
There are likely to be over a million individuals interested in recovering their account holdings from this now defunct exchange.  Despite the reality of insolvency, it may still be possible to honor those debts.  The process would be slow, and yet ultimately feasible.  It may involve reviving the exchange itself, or forming a new one entirely in which previous MtGox customers already hold funds (which are gradually freed up to withdraw.)
If you have an interest in such a proposal, this is your time to move.  It would require MtGox to turn over audit-able records of what it's account holders *should* own to another management party.  Once this is established, the exchange undergoes a re-vamped improvement to security and transparency.   It continues to operate as a not-for-profit entity while using revenue to pay back indebted deposits, and eventually shifts to a for-profit business which is help by investors and the original management board alike. 
You might ask, who has an interest in using or helping to run such an exchange?  Look around.  There are many bitcoiners that would be dedicated to using an exchange if they already had deposits there, and could see those funds freed up.  If individuals know that their activity and use of the exchange is helping every affected MtGox customer be made whole, then where there's a will there's a way.

Gox was a poorly managed bitcoin exchange in Japan that ran into serious problems because of bad coding and management.  The size and scope of their loss is staggering because they were one of the first companies to foray into the bitcoin world, lending to their early popularity but eventual demise. 
Just as a failure of even a large service like yahoo wouldn't spell the end of email, a failure of an exchange doesn't spell the end of bitcoin.  It's a protocol, and many companies out there use it correctly and responsibly.  Going forward they'll have to in order to survive, because the one's who don't simply end up like Gox.

Paper wallets are fine, but you also have to consider the possibility that the paper itself can be lost, destroyed, or stolen.  The private key may be copied at some point in the generation or printing process, and if you ever go to spend the bitcoin again, you'll have to trust whatever wallet program or process that imports the private key and reads it.  Not to say they aren't useful, but just points to consider.

I'd go with Coinbase because they've got a few extra advantages going for them.  Conversions happen at flat 1% rate and the cost is waived on your first $1,000,000 in payments. This simple business model has worked well for the likes of Dell, Overstock, Dish, Expedia, Wikipedia, etc
They've also got a dedicated service department for merchants to help answer questions 
They're also a consumer wallet, which means there's already more than 1.5 million users (and potential customers) actively using the service.  Coinbase also tends to offer more features when it comes to accepting BTC, rather than assume you'll always wish to immediately sell it. 
But honestly, it's just great that you're opening your doors to bitcoin.  My advice is to sign up with whichever one seems reasonable, and if you love it great.  If you hate it, know you've always got a backup option.

I'm upvoting this for visibility because I think it needs discussion, but I'm also going to go on record by saying this is probably not the best or most ideal solution. 
This proposal leaves a lot of unanswered questions.  So they want to create 1:1 alt-currency called a gox coin, but what will determine its value?  If it's ultimately traded 1:1 with BTC, won't that artificially increase the supply of bitcoin by a significant amount? 
I started a discussion 4 days ago on the idea of opening an exchange which essentially transfers the balances over to a new not-for-profit platform.  It would allow users to still trade using their balances, while unlocking the ability to withdraw those funds slowly over time as exchange fees feed back to the users. Deposits and withdrawals for other users would still work as normal.

Some people see the utility of keeping fiat on an exchange for the purposes of opportunistic trading in the event of a market crash, hence stabilizing the price (preventing it from going too low).

I've pondered this as well, and technically the answer is yes, you need a wallet that doesn't have the private keys stored, it just has the pre-created transactions that have been made but not broadcast.  The owner's final password doesn't decrypt or show any private keys, it just broadcasts the transaction.

Coinbase is a USD saturated market, meaning it's much easier for people to buy bitcoin there than other services.  If more people are trying to buy it there than sell, they have their own price and it will be higher than a given exchange.

Don't pay the ransom.  Even if you do, your system still has the virus/malware that caused it.  Even if you do, there's nothing to say that the attacker won't do the same thing again and make you pay more.  
The correct response when your computer is infected with a cryptolocker virus is to immediately turn it off.  Take it to a computer security expert/data recovery specialist, and if nothing can be done, throw it in the trash.  
In any case, you should carefully evaluate what caused this to happen and how to protect your data from this kind of attack in the future (cloud storage, backups, etc)
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:10:35
I like the way you think, but BIP 0038 would arguably be the same thing as a password protected output (being itself a password protected private key)
@_date: 2014-08-04 20:36:00
I think that's a valid point, but also consider that the "single team of security experts" has to exist for every single website out there, and they don't always get it right.  There was an issue recently where the adobe database leak resulted in a password list that wasn't properly salted, and [the plaintext passwords could be derived.](
Consider also that at some fundamental level, some inherently evil or ignorant websites will be asking for your email + password combo in a manner that can be disclosed.  The point is that you shouldn't have to share this private information with *anyone* to create a login session. 
Your personal wallet might exist on a phone too, so there's no need to trust the security of multiple different devices, even public devices, when signing in there.   Keyloggers could be stymied by this mechanism. 
It's still early in this field, and there are a lot of valid competitors for this kind of a password replacement idea.  If digital currency wallets help manage cryptographic keys effectively enough and their usage grows, the two ideas could co-exist well together. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:16:43
The password is just a generic security step created by the wallet in order to protect what's inside. 
Each bitcoin address has a private key associated with it, this is what the wallet is protecting.  This is a type of key that can be transferred around from device to device, and anyone in possession of it is able to spend coins at the address.  
If you know the private key, it's as simple as getting another type of wallet to import that key and then the bitcoins will be associated there too. 
If you just know the password to your old wallet, you've got a very big problem.  You will need access to the hard drive, and hope that a data recovery specialist can help find the info.
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:58:31
it looks like someone was trying to drive down the market price recently with a big and sudden sell, no doubt they want to influence the amount that others are bidding, and it's a win/win because they'll have more USD to bid with
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:01:58
That's not a really strong rebuttal at all.  It doesn't offer any new insights or substantiate claims beyond making conjecture.  
Yes, it's great to eliminate the requirement to trust another wherever possible, but this isn't a feasible goal for all business models.  I.e. if I order a package from amazon, at some point I'm going to have to trust their website and a delivery service to send it to my house. There's no way to mathematically or cryptographically ensure that's going to happen.
There are some semblances of truly decentralized exchanges in the works that offer purely trustless trading based on cryptographic contracts.  However, at the interface where fiat enters and exists the system, there will always be some level of trust necessary and involved.  You can leave this in the hands of a more centralized service (like a bank or exchange) or have faith in random individuals (localbitcoins)

Call it whatever semantical quirk you wish.  It's actually not as big of a deal as MtGox makes it out to be. It's only a problem and can cause issues if not properly coded for.  Hence, there's a desire to standardize this part of the protocol to make it more system friendly.


The issue is not whether it identifies the transaction, but whether the presence of this number alone in the blockchain can verify the existence of a payment.  There are many ways to do this.  A more appropriate method of verifying payment for instance, is to check for the destinations outputs.


You can do lots of things with it.  If you're a service handling millions of transactions you can use it as a reference for which transactions you've attempted to generate, and when comparing it to outputs it can also tell you where those transactions didn't get included into the blockchain or were double spent. 


Let me know when they build an exchange service. 


Absolutely.  It's only an issue if your service fails that logic check and that doesn't know how to see instances where the transaction has been modified.

I said failings of bitcoin security, not failings of bitcoin itself.  We need to take a good hard look at how users will be expected to hold and store their bitcoin, while also retaining the ability to easily spend and transfer it.
I'm talking about about the glaring problem of theft in the cryptocurrency world.  The fact that funds can be instantly and permanently stolen without possibility of retrieval is an issue that needs to be comprehensively addressed.  Black hats who succeed in theft are very likely to get away with it, and repeat their behavior.  
This naturally leads to all sorts of uncomfortable talk such as blacklisting or redlisting certain bitcoin addresses. I'm not a proponent of this.  A more elegant solution would be more preventative tools that are so effective, they make bitcoin almost impossible to steal to begin with.

You might have to revisit this idea.  Why is NFC untrusted?  Because it's capable of transmitting (intentionally or not) your entire credit card payment data.  That's the current flaw of our payment system, some just needs to know your CC numbers and they can spend your funds. 
Yet the information that's being communicated in the video here is simply the public bitcoin address.  You can't spend or steal funds with that, and the address signing happens entirely within the phone itself.  
NFC suddenly looks pretty interesting to me.

It's an interesting idea for holding chunks of funds in a pending state, but breaks down for users who want to spend funds on a more demanding basis.  The flaw is that you would pull your funds from pending, put them in a hot wallet to be spent to any address you choose, and the thief would steal them there. 
I like the "something you did" security concept though.  A more foolproof method that needs to be ironed out is a method that can reliably delay transactions from being broadcast to begin with, while still publicly affirming an intention to be broadcast.

What you're describing sounds like an intriguing concept at first, but the consequences for abuse are disastrous. 
* Suppose I go on bitcoin ebay to sell something of mine, like a painting, for 1 BTC.  
* I must put up 1 BTC into the escrow.  (Problem number 1, I must have at least as much money as the thing I'm trying to sell) 
* Then someone buys my painting and puts their own 1 BTC payment into the escrow too. 
* The buyer receives my painting, but then "cheats" and claims they never got it. They refuse to unlock my payment. They're out 1 BTC, but they have my product now. 
* What do I get as the seller?  A lost product AND a lost escrow.  
**TL;DR** - awful for merchants, who are categorically always risking more than the buyer.

Double spends wouldn't persist in the blockchain memory for long, but MtGox would still have
1) A record of what their system thought the withdrawal tx should have been
2) A record of when a user's withdrawal failed and had to be restarted

Greg, I've responded to your points there as well. 
The reality that multi-sig is not easy for the average user to create, and despite being a fantastic idea, it's far from the default level of security in bitcoin.  This describes a mechanism whereby someone can split up the password control necessary to fully sign-off on their transactions.  If people can think of better and more efficient ways of doing so, I'm all for it.  Let's help make it easy enough for even the new users to implement and set up.

Sounds suspicious.  You're going to need to post some transactions for people to take a look at.  Ideally, just let people know the address which you withdrew the 6.4 BTC to. 
When the 5 BTC were sent back to MtGox, was this a brand new transaction or did it appear as if the original 6.4 deposit never happened?

Good question, this wallet would be for long term storage, (bitcoin that you don't need to spend immediately) but the delay is adjustable to a point where it could simply be minutes or months depending on your preference. 
If you still wanted a hot wallet that could spend a certain amount of bitcoin immediately, you could make a separate partition for that.

If the attacker manually credits bitcoin back to the exchange's "receive back" address, the exchange would take this as an automatic indication that the transaction was successful.  No system action would be taken to retry or give out more funds at this point, so it would end up being a costly attack that has no benefit.  
Additionally, if whether successful or not, there's no way that an attacker could modify the transaction in such a way that the exchange *doesn't* receive their funds back.  They can't spend these inputs because they don't hold the private keys.

I'm very interested in darkcoin in terms of technical achievement. Keep in mind the coin is still in an active development phase, but Evan Duffield has been amazing at pushing out the updates, including:
* Full Coinjoin tech built straight into the native client, so you never have to trust or pay a mixing service for privacy. 
* secured by 11 different types of hashing algorithms
* ASIC resistance, (even against scrypt asics) to the point where it's viable to run with CPU and GPU tech at home
* Cards run at significantly cooler temperatures due to the X11 algorithm, which allows the processor to take breaks while hashing.  
* dynamic block reward rate that continuously re-targets and increases the per-block payout if the difficulty gets too low. 
* gradual 7% annual reward rate tapering, instead of 50% drops every X years. 
* improved dark gravity wave to guard against timewarp attacks. 
Full disclosure, I do own some darkcoin and would be interested in seeing it further developed, just like bitcoin.  I imagine each currency will have its own niche uses in the future.

Potential solution: **Forget Transaction Hash Tracking**
* 1.) When a user withdraws funds, have your service include an additional output to send your own BTC back to an address you control
* 2.) Set up a callback for that address
* 3.) Did the callback fire?  Great, you received your funds back, the user got their withdrawal too. 
Mutate the tx hash all you want, a user can't fake not receiving your payment and this process doesn't require changes to the bitcoin protocol to fix.

Not sure what you mean.  This tech is about signing into the website without them having to know what credentials you used to sign in.  
On the back end they're presenting your computer with a challenge, and asking your wallet to modify the challenge into the answer in a way that only the person who controls the correct address could do.

I could agree with this, but in lieu of the fact that perhaps not everyone in the world is able to buy separate notebooks or hardware wallets just to use bitcoin, this idea combines another layer of protection using software only d) something you did.  
We can rely on the fact that at some point in time (upon receiving bitcoins) you can set up rules for what happens when those coins later go to be spent.  If everyone running the same type of wallet needs to respect those rules in order to participate, then the rules essentially become permanent as they're laid down with time.  (Much like how bitcoin transactions can be permanently recorded in the blockchain, and coins can't be re-spent once used)

If these are valid transactions in the bitcoin network they should be recorded in your history, if they're invalid they will (and should) eventually disappear.

I'm really glad you asked!  There are many potential ways to communicate this information securely.  Since linked wallets are essentially sharing partially formed redeem scripts (which are otherwise useless to anyone else not holding the private keys) it should be safe to communicate them publicly.  
One potential solution may be a type of network that sets up and maintains temporary records of these spend attempts.  This would be distinctly different from the blockchain, and every local wallet program running this multi-sig software would become a node.  You set your wallet to "listen in" on spend attempts coming from specific other addresses, and this allows you to see when someone (hopefully you) is trying to move funds.  From there you can either confirm it with a co-sign or reject it. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:28:16
False.  What's been considered a minor and not-worth-exploiting issue for years has becoming increasingly too common and partially disruptive to the network as a whole.  Bitcoin developers could release a client that disabled malleable transactions, and I would run it on my end.

Not really.  Bitcoin doesn't stand for anything.  It's a tool.  The only "philosophy" involved within it belongs to that of it's users, and majority consensus.  Tempting as it may sound, if you want to apply scripture to code then you've started the beginnings of a religion.
Heck you don't even need a majority to make a change, just a significant chunk of users who will agree on something.  If the issue is divisive enough, people might just create an altcoin fork out of it and continue with a version of the BTC history that somehow undoes the damage caused by MtGox. 
Will it be valuable?  The markets decide, and if enough people were affected it may be potentially valuable indeed.  That's probably the only objective maxim left to follow, in that users will always be acting out of their own self interest.  So how can you expect the MtGox forsaken to think any differently? 
**Disclaimer** - As much as I love debating this philosophical/ethical conundrum (which has heavily biased parties on both sides influenced by greed, subjective determinations of value, and more greed) it's probably a good idea to note:
* we don't actually have a definitive confirmation of how many bitcoins are missing at this point
* we don't have a confirmation of how they went missing
* If someone lost a private key, it's a non issue.  If someone forgot a password, that's a potentially solvable problem
* We don't yet know the extent and involvement of government, legal, and corporate intervention on the issue
So I'm not going to speculate on further hypotheticals until more concrete facts are known.

I'm going to play "devil's advocate/counterparty" to the notion that people should be blamed for keeping any sum of money on an exchange. This is a common attitude, and it's ludicrous.  
* P2P exchanges are not fully functional yet, so centralized trading is simply one of the easiest options we've got.  Fledgling bitcoin would not have gotten off the ground at all if there weren't individuals willing to take the risk to use these services.  
* the next time you look at a price ticker and count the worth of your coins, keep in mind that they only have value because of an enormous amount of fiat sitting around in market bid orders.  If that process gets disrupted, there is no support for the price and your coins are effectively worthless.
* it shouldn't have to be a big deal to store your funds on an exchange for trading purposes.  Especially when it's legal, and when reasonable security measures have been taken. 
* for some people, trading is a skillset.  Buying, withdrawing, and hoarding BTC just isn't enough.  Rather than just be influenced by the trends, there are those that want to help shape them.  
* I'm not here to defend MtGox, but I don't think its that hard to see why some people still use them as an exchange.  Their price has more volatility, they operate under a number of different currencies, and slippage is less of a concern since they historically shared a significant chunk of the overall bitcoin trading volume. 
* Has MtGox had their problems? Absolutely, but don't assume that everyone has been affected equally.  What you see in the social channels are the vocal cases bubbling up with discontent.  
Ultimately, **stop trying to shift blame to the victims.** We all have to rely on third party services at some point when using bitcoin.  It's clear here who's to blame, and pointing the finger at traders isn't going to solve any problems.
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:04:45
1) Set up an account at  wallets are free, and you don't have to give them any banking info unless you want to sell the BTC for USD. 
2) Go to your transactions page here  and click "request money"
3) Leave everything blank and just hit "request money" again to confirm, bam, instant QR code that links back to your account.  Post this anywhere and people will be able to send  money to it, without having the ability to take it back out. 
Side note, you also will want to protect your account with 2-factor by adding a phone number.  This makes it harder for people to access your funds if you used a bad password, because they'll need access to your phone to spend anything.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:54:02
Cool.  Anyone can also retain simple control of their bitcoin by withdrawing it to an address they control.  
I do like the fact that Coinbase has a buyback feature.  When I spend BTC on an order, I can immediately purchase more to replenish my supply.  This helps me take advantage of any discounts the merchant may be offering using BTC, and it keeps the economy at a net equilibrium.

So if you're a US cryptocurrency miner or trade it on an exchange, you're not an MSB according to FinCEN. 
This combined with the other (shocking) revelations that the US is not going to consider bitcoin illegal, is the biggest rubber stamp of approval and acceptance yet - a complete change of tone from last year when users were categorically unsure of the direction going forward.

That's a pretty neat example situation, a kid has a spend account that requires a parental approval to co-sign for purchases.  It would be made all the easier if the connected programs and apps can run on multiple different types of devices.  
I think it's a good idea to develop multi-sig for a variety of situations: 
* for multiple users that need to split up spend control
* for a single user that wants extra layers of completely self-managed wallet security

"volume" is a measure of bitcoin volume.  Since the price is lower, more coins move proportional to fiat.
i.e. 
$1,000 sale at $1,000 USD/BTC = 1 BTC volume
$1,000 sale at $100 USD/ BTC = 10 BTC Volume

In the bitcoin world the trust equation is flipped.  Instead of businesses trusting customers, the customer has to trust the business.  This is pretty ideal for when you have a known business (like Steam) who wants to uphold a reputation and attract customers.  If the company doesn't have to cover for the small but significant percentage of their userbase who charges back, then they save $$$ in the long run and those savings can mean lower prices. 
Is it a perfect equation at the moment? Not at all, some key elements are missing to make it a truly trustless operation.  The flipside is that fraudulent merchants can appear, often with nothing more than a legitimate looking website.

This text is straight from the foundation's website, and this much is clear:  If you put on a face to become a board member of the Bitcoin Foundation (a group that aims to standardize, protect, and promote bitcoin) then you also have the obligation to make sure your own actions are transparent and positively reflect on the nature of bitcoin as a whole.  
This post on the forum discussion page is particularly relevant:

Yup.  But never across chains, it would mean individuals have dual ownership in each system.


Debatable, one chain would clearly be the "original BTC" and one would clearly have been modified by Gox, each with their own financial support.


It's a reality we'll eventually have to deal with, because it's a possibility that isn't going away.  What triggers it might as well be a big enough cataclysmic event that forces enough people to fork.
How many does it take?  Nature will run its course.  Suppose a virus systematically wiped out a huge swatch of bitcoin holdings by a previously unknown client modification that made bitcoind nodes relay their own transactions into unspendable addresses.  Reverts and retractions can start to look attractive.  Be it 50%, or 75%, or 95%, or 99%.  With enough consensus, any rule change is possible.

it wouldn't be as secure as you'd think.  If a thief discovered your encryption key, they could just wait the same amount of time to steal the funds.  It's basically the same as putting a massive amount of inconvenience on the spendability of your own money without actually increasing security much at all.
Furthermore, you'd have no way of knowing for certain if the "key" is compromised. 
But I see what you're trying to do, and a couple simple fixes can help.
1) Include a failsafe
2) Make it so that the act of spending coins starts the waiting process.  This publicly broadcasts an intention and nothing actually gets "sent" until the time period passes. 
How is this different? It let's you know when your coins are going to be spent.  It's not a chargeback, it's a mandatory fuse that needs to burn before coins are gone for good. 
Another alternative you may want to consider is the possibility of a forced direction wallet.  An address that can only forward bitcoin into another address or two

What side of the country are you on?
@_date: 2014-01-31 19:43:53
Excellent question.  The short answer is no.  
Long answer: when the wallet lays down rules for how the delay is enforced and what backup wallet it may direct to, it's essentially creating a timestamped copy of these rules that is communicated to all other wallets.  This is the first and thus only accepted instance of these rules being written.  Anything afterwards will be considered void, and a wallet trying to create or relay incorrect rules after the-fact would have to drop them or not be able to participate in transactions.   
In much the same way that you can't re-spend bitcoins once they've already been spent, it won't be possible to go back and re-write the rules for a specific address in your wallet once they've already been written.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:36:33

Deconstructing your hyperbolic headline, in reality the computer nerds would recover the bitcoin that were meant to be there in the first place (given OP's assumption that they are lost)

Brain wallets allow people to store bitcoins by turning any set of words into a reproducible bitcoin address. 
Say that you wanted to make a bitcoin address out of the phrase "i_love_archaeology."  You can do this, and it will always yield
1NYHmXzjuvapa7pe1vBEjaG8igvZEL2ESS 
and 5HscDRJpGGMYq8gi3ncR8N8Tx6jdVu78zCEPnzEs5Vi64ro2892
As the corresponding public and private keys. 
The problem is that anyone *else* who comes up with or guesses that same phrase will also arrive at the same destination.  People are inherently bad at making passwords and pass-phrases with high entropy, and often require the assistance of special tools to help them do so.  
While bitcoin addresses generated via a wallet are typically very secure, generating a brainwallet address opens you up to the vulnerability that someone else can guess your same phrase.  
There are people who have created wallets with millions upon millions of brainwallet addresses, one for every word in the dictionary, for every word in other language dictionaries, for every common phrase and variation of the sort.  Whenever someone deposits into that address, they're also depositing into someone else's wallet as well, allowing for them to immediately spend the coins. 
For this reason, unless you have a great understanding of entropy, you're better off just using a normal wallet and not a brainwallet, or at the very least bip 0038, which is a different form of passphrase protection.

Sweeping is equivalent to the term "send."
If I have 1 BTC in a wallet, and I "sweep" it into another, I've just taken the bitcoin at one address and put it in the next. 
Its distinctively different from the concept of "importing" an address, which usually means to associate the address itself with a wallet.  
In my opinion, sweeping is almost always preferable, there is rarely a reason to import.  Importing an address can create a security vulnerability if the private key for that address becomes compromised

 We've proposed an approach,. In the three days that it has been posted you have not provided any substantive comment on it. Will this fit your needs? Are you able to implement it? have you attempted to implement it? If so can we test agreement between this implementation and yours? Do you have an alternative proposal?
I don't believe there is anything more that the core devs should be doing here or are planning on doing at this time. What exactly are you expecting from us?

 The implementation here fits what I discussed with  and on IRC on the chatroom dedicated to this issue. It is still missing ways to get this id while sending coins (for example "normsendtoaddress" rpc method?) but apart from this, this seems to works exactly as we suggested.
I am unsure about a single point: bitcoin usually reverse bytes in hashes for txs and blocks, I do guess the same should happen for this. I believe we should keep this standard consistent but I am unsure if SignatureHash does that or not.

Potential solution for a service: **Forget Transaction Hash Tracking**
* 1.) When a user withdraws funds, have your service include an additional output in the same transaction to send your own BTC back to an address you control
* 2.) Set up a callback for your address
* 3.) Did the callback fire? If yes, you received your funds back, and the user got their withdrawal too.  If no, your funds never left, and neither did the users.
Mutate the tx hash all you want, a user can't fake not receiving your payment and this process doesn't require changes to the bitcoin protocol to fix.

Agreed, there are major hurdles.  This idea assumes that the MtGox exchange itself is unusable, and all of the funds are gone and unrecoverable.  What this does is:
* crowd-source the hundreds of thousands of affected users under one banner
* give them a means to petition Mark Karpeles to release their account records so they can prove what they owned there.  
* provide users with the power to vote for new management to run an exchange in which they are entitled to either some form of ownership, or an entitlement to reclaim what they are owed (their choice)
* in the event that MtGox depositors cannot reclaim their lost funds via legal means, the not-for-profit exchange established on their behalf would allow them a means to slowly do so, and provide them a more trusted mechanism and platform to trade.
It would be entirely separate from MtGox and their management team, and would slowly work to repay whatever account debts may exist.  The advantage is that it unites a very large group of bitcoin traders to begin with and gives them a cause to trade and work for. (the funds that they are rightfully owed)

My advice is to take everyone's advice with a grain of salt.  There will be people here who tell you to "forget it" because it's convenient, or because they truly have no idea what they're talking about. They will try to convince you that it's your fault, you should have known better, and in an attempt to feel more insulated from such threats they'll distance their position from yours. 
The truth is that there are many, many people with BTC and fiat at Gox, and this story is only beginning to unfold.   
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:41:05
In a nutshell, Coinbase and Bitpay have taken very different approaches: 
*  - Coinbase has a 1% currency conversion fee, but waves this on the first $1,000,000 in payments for merchants. There are no other fees beyond this, and if you just wanted to accept and keep bitcoin there is no cost to do so.
*  - Bitpay has tiered monthly memberships, the size and cost of which depend on the $ value of your payment processing needs.
Both offer instant conversions to avoid any variability in price.  Between the two of them, I honestly prefer Coinbase.

The difficulty isn't tied to the number of miners, it's pegged to the amount of hashpower put into the network.  It's entirely possible for a handful of individuals, (or entities) to be capable of producing more efficient mining equipment than anyone else.  
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:16:30
The place to start looking in general would be to find accounts that withdrew more than they ever deposited or bought on the exchange.  
This is somewhat difficult to do because as far as we know, the entirety of the MtGox exchange records have never been publicly available, and they may not have been accurate either. 
Assuming the exchange actually kept a detailed log of each account's deposits and withdrawals, then it should be possible to just calculate what the balance of each wallet SHOULD be once everything is accounted for.  
If you ever ended up with more funds on Gox than you expected, it's probably also a good idea to come forward and say so even anonymously.  This probably happened to many people, and it will give a better idea of just how badly the exchange was run.

Coinbase has a pretty easy POS option called the merchant app, you can download it to your smartphone.  
Either company has instant cashout available as an option.  If you set that up you're technically accepting bitcoin but never holding it, just getting the USD.  
You can either get customers to scan a barcode on your phone (most common), or you can even have a barcode just printed out somewhere (like a logo on the side of the foodtruck)  and verify whenever they send a payment to the address.

There are lots of ideas for this.  Distributed ATMs are one, but they still rely on a centralized tech. 
Secondary to this would a "bitcoin only" exchange system that involves the lending and accepting of BTC.  There are various checks that can ensure that no one party can cheat the system.  Users are essentially swapping buying power within that system, and can also exchange fiat with other members to trade for that power outside of the site. 
The key is to set it up in such a way that no centralized authority or server is required at all.  It acts more like a meshnet run on cryptocurrency contracts.

Partly correct.  
Coinbase is becoming a one-stop shop for all manner of bitcoin services. 
They're a payment processor for merchants who want to accept BTC and convert that to cash. 
They're a hosted wallet for users (and other merchants) who want to store BTC
They're a brokerage service for when people want to lock in a price and buy BTC using funds that aren't currently on the site. 
They're a USD wallet service (and EUR wallet service for 19 countries, soon to be 30) 
They facilitate instant purchases 
They have tools for multi-sig and vaults

Bitcoin has utility at *any* value.  
I was using it back when it was in the $15-100 range, and I'm still using it now. 
There has definitely been a mining bubble and it's due to pop, but that doesn't mean most of the hashpower necessarily goes into a single collective hand.  
Mining and the price are in equilibrium with one another.   
* The price can't get too high because (for the next few decades or so) there will be significant sell pressure created from newly minted coins in the form of increased supply
* The price can't get too low because as mining rewards decrease, it simply becomes more profitable to buy coins than invest in mining equipment, and the amount of sell pressure created by miners is diminished at lower prices.

Ugh, I'm afraid you could be right.
Consider the problem:
"how can we be safe when we can't unscramble the terrorists encrypted messages on his phone?"
You can try to ban encryption itself but this would be practically unenforceable.  
You could then try to outlaw any product made in the US using encryption but this would be an enormous technological step backward.  
You could then try to actively prosecute people who have been found to be using encrypted messages in order to crack down.  You might even catch some "offenders," but what you're left with is an endless war of whack-a-mole punishing people who are interested in privacy at the expense of a smaller fraction who actually wish to do us harm.

That's a fantastic idea, but where did you get the little keychain authenticator from? The act of distributing it to all users is itself a barrier to entry, and there would be an associated cost.  
Also, what happens if you lose it?  Every security implementation is only as strong as its reset process.  
To be sure, keyfob code generators are fantastic, a hair better than native code generation on a smart phone.

@_date: 2015-01-17 05:52:05
Both are good, but it's important to know that each company has different approaches to their merchant and consumer services (and different pricing models).
Bitpay advertises a "free conversion" model: 
In reality Bitpay still makes money by setting their own exchange rate.  There are business and enterprise plans available that offer more features.  
Coinbase advertises 0% fees on the first $1,000,000 in sales, and 1% conversions after that.  
There are no tiered business models or account activation fees with Coinbase, if you want to work with them they have a very helpful and knowledgeable support team on standby.  Coinbase is also a full hosted wallet service, so you can also buy/sell/store/and transfer bitcoin using your wallet there, about 2 million other users around the world do the same.
My advice would be to try one, and if you don't like the experience try the other.  It's great that you're looking to accept BTC anyway!

OP, if you're one of the "Graviteers" [listed on this page]( I would  recommend first reaching out to the bitcoin foundation itself.  Mark Karpeles (the CEO of MtGox) is a board member there, and the foundation would likely respond to calls that MtGox itself has a vested interest in properly conducting business *as transparently and effectively as possible* in order to remain on that board.  
Whether users like them or not, this exchange still ties into the bitcoin economy as a whole.  Their continued problems can become everyone's headache, and issues there reflect on the greater reputation (and criticism) of bitcoin as a whole.

Both are fine for purchasing bitcoin, I've been using Coinbase without issues for over a year. 
If you don't plan on spending or trading with your bitcoins for a period of time, it's perfectly fine to put them in cold storage. 
Coindesk has a not-so-terrible article that describes some of the various storage methods: 
Coinbase offers a couple tools to store bitcoin besides an online wallet:
* A vault that takes extra confirmations and time delays to withdraw from (they still control the private key)
* A multi-sig vault.  Takes an extra password or key to open and (you control the private keys)
* And paper wallets (better to print these on an offline computer)
There are many ways to go about this, good hunting!

Before investing you should define limits of what you are willing to risk.  It can be exhilarating to trade with larger amounts and imagine larger gains, but you need to confront the reality of the risks you take on or eventually it can come back to bite you in the ass.

I think you're exactly right.  Anyone attempting to run an exchange in the US knows it's a risky venture.

You can't necessarily pay interest on the BTC amount itself (because BTC is a finite quantity) but a company could consider paying interest on the average USD amount of a deposit. 
Still, there's a reason why this hasn't happened yet.  Banks pay you a meager interest on your deposit because they make money by loaning it out.  Coinbase doesn't loan out your BTC, it's not a fractional reserve system.
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:06:19
It's totally fine to ask paranoid questions about this sort of stuff. 
When I print my offline wallets, I use a computer that has never and will never be connected to the internet, I also use a printer that has never and will never be connected to the internet.  
If you use a computer that is connected (now or in the future) to the internet to print your cold storage wallets, it would theoretically be possible for malware to intercept the images.  Going completely offline just affords a peace of mind.

I'd be okay with this if they ditched Mark Karpeles and started with a new CEO and a new codebase.  They have a substantial amount of BTC now anyway.

There's been a group of 0-day accounts posting links to the Willy Report recently, claiming bitcoin never deserved to have it's high price.  
Even assuming the Willy report is 100% accurate and interpreted correctly, even understanding the implications that MtGox inflated their bitcoin exchange rate, the broader picture is that MtGox was a bad exchange that was due to fold.  They couldn't and no one can keep up that ruse forever. 
At the same time, plenty of other reputable exchanges have popped up.  MtGox saw it's market share decrease, and the ability to convert between fiat/btc is becoming more and more *decentralized.*  As we move forward into the future this is getting us at a fairer market price and one that isn't easily manipulated.  
So sell if you want to, I'll gladly buy them at the right time and the right price.
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:49:31
Not sure I buy that argument.  There is a direct cost associated with running a node, if that price gets too high, it will reduce the number of people willing and able to run nodes.  This is precisely one reason why increasing the block size can be a dangerous idea if not executed reasonably.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:18:08
MtGox was one of the exchanges that was present from very early in bitcoin's history. 
It endured big setbacks (such as an internal hack/theft) in summer of 2011 but came back, eventually becoming *the* go-to exchange for anyone who wanted to buy bitcoin around 2011-early 2013. 
It suffered from more issues in early 2013 as the catapulting price of bitcoin brought the trading engine to it's knees and the trading was also brought to a halt due to ddos attacks.  
There were periods of time where you could try to enter an  order and it wouldn't execute for 5,10,15+ minutes.  
By summer of 2013 MtGox was still a significant player in the BTC world but several million of their US assets were seized in a government crackdown when it turned out the owner, Mark Karpeles, hadn't registered the company correctly in the States. 
MtGox subsequently lost access to  primary acccount funding partners dwolla and bitinstant.  It was still possible to get money into the exchange but in the later months of July-December 2013 it became increasingly more difficult to withdraw fiat. 
Either because of it's longstanding weathered reputation, or naivety, (or both), users still were still using MtGox (bitcoin withdrawals were working fine) but in increasingly smaller numbers.  Other exchanges like Bitstamp, BitFinex, and Brokerage services like Coinbase became the trading spots. 
In December of 2013 MtGox announced lower trading fees, this combined with the meteoric rise of BTC lured back some traders.  What they didn't know at the time was that MtGox was effectively insolvent and was trying to make back money in fees. 
By January 2014 MtGox was beginning to have serious issues with fulfilling users bitcoin withdrawals.  The price of bitcoin in general (and on the exchange itself) was plummeting as a result of the news.  One of BTC's biggest and oldest exchanges was going under and investors were reacting negatively. 
By Mid January MtGox halted BTC withdrawals entirely as they promised to fix the source of the error.  After a few weeks of petty arguing back and forth with the bitcoin devs claiming with Mark claiming some flaw in bitcoin was allowing users to double spend withdrawals (it was poor website design that allowed this) the news came: MtGox declared itself insolvent. 
They had lost the vast majority of user assets (both fiat and bitcoin) due to shoddy coding, poor security practices, and bad amateur management.  
The higher-ups at MtGox may not have directly stolen the funds, but their ignorance caused them to be lost.  I would also accuse them of accepting user deposits when they knew the exchange was insolvent.

If you're a physical storefront, you could have tablets (or even phones) at the payment terminal that use the Coinbase merchant app.  
This allows your employees to set order prices and customers can pay directly into the app just by scanning the QR code.  From there the bitcoin payment could be stored or you could have it set to immediately sell so you get the USD delivered to your bank. 
The merchant app doesn't allow spend access either, so it's a nice way to let all of your employees use the "receive bitcoin" function without accessing your actual Coinbase account.

I forgot the backup password to my multi-sig vault and recovered my funds using the cold seed.  It worked flawlessly and I was pretty relieved!
You can also recover your funds offline in the event that Coinbase goes down.  They basically control 1 of the 3 keys needed to spend funds, you control the other 2.
You can do multi-sig all by yourself using other tool too, just depends on how user friendly the tool is.

The situation Gox is describing involves a user who withdraws funds, and then races to have their mutated version of the transaction included in the blockchain first so that the original tx fails to be included. It doesn't have to work every time.  Even 1 in 1000 is okay because it's a low cost attack. 
If the "attacker" succeeds in getting their mutated version of the transaction included in the blockchain, then they take advantage of the fact that MtGox's system recognizes the original transaction as failed at this point.  The user could come back to Gox with the original tx, say "hey look, you gave me this and it never confirmed." and get their funds back.  
If it's happening on an automated scale and Gox is crediting users back when every time when their tx's don't confirm, black hats may have found a way to milk the system for free. 
The core issue lies with what steps your system should take when it notices that the transaction being sent out doesn't confirm, or fails.  A human observer could just say "well did the receiver's address balance update? yes? okay you're lying."
Getting a system to automatically discern this information, or the bitcoin protocol itself adjusted, is a bit trickier.
**A potential solution**
Gox could just send out a payment to their own address with every customer withdrawal and record if/when this arrives back into their own account.  Forget tracking transaction hashes.  If the "receive-back" payment is successful, then the funds were sent out.

This is the first time in a while you've said something that I can largely agree with.  However, 


You don't *have* to trivialize the rationale of your opponents to effectively disagree with them.  I invite you to consider that all this fighting is going on because
1) Some people are legitimately trying to hurt bitcoin
2) Some people believe there should be multiple teams working on bitcoin, instead of one core group
3) *Some people are genuinely concerned that full blocks are an imminent threat. The fact that the current network can temporarily devolve into a congested roadblock with a spam attack is unacceptable, and proves the cost of doing so is too low.*
We may disagree exactly on when full blocks will become problematic, but if we can solve the problem as a community in a rationale and level-headed way then I think we're on the same page.

* private key 2
* address 3

One of the cardinal rules of bitcoin is to make sure you control your money.  (more technically, this means you control the private keys to your addresses and no one else stores them for you)
There are a few exceptions to this.  High frequency traders typically keep some fiat and some BTC available on an exchange. 
Looking back, there is a big list of spectacularly failed companies that tried to offer bitcoin services and screwed up big time, but the warning signs were usually there. 
If you need a bitcoin service, look for places that have a lot of users, don't have a lot of negative press, and have been around a while.

It has massive benefits for merchants but they don't want to accept it unless a lot of their customers use bitcoin. 
Bitcoin gives consumers more freedom over their money, but what they can do with it is limited by the number of merchants who take it. 
Debit cards like this one serve as a necessary bridge.  They let people own bitcoin and greatly expand what they can do with it.  Once it reaches a tipping point and more people have BTC, merchants might just decide to start accepting it outright.

Business don't need to hoard BTC To become profitable.  They might have some incentive to keep bitcoin around sure, but they could continuously be cashing out to earn USD. 
You're right that bitcoin becomes scarce as more people become interested in it.  There are an estimated 5 million bitcoin users globally right now, and 13,927,650 BTC in existence.  
That works out to about 2.78553 BTC per user.  The scarcity can also definitely drive up the price

Well there's a sticking point.  I would expect that a dominant cryptocurrency would eventually be able to compete with VISA.  
Otherwise, doesn't that put bitcoin in a position where demand permanently outpaces the available number of transactions?  Everyone who wants to lodge a transaction in the permanently immutable ledger would have to pay an exorbitant fee to get one in.  Transactions would be slow to confirm for most participants.  People who want to "buy coffee" would be forced to transact off-chain or on other chains entirely, meaning miners wouldn't see any portion of that revenue.
These points above paint a stark picture of the future of bitcoin, where the only transactions that make sense to include on-chain are high value.  Some other tech else could easily come along and say "hey, for everything else use our high capacity chain"

"Double spend" isn't the right terminology. 
Normally, a double spend means that you use coins at one address to spend them into two locations.  The network usually detects this and only counts the first spend as valid.  After some time the second "double spend" is never confirmed in a block and is never accepted as valid by the network.
This situation you're talking about with a forked network is very different.  It means two entirely separate networks are running in tandem.  One would be bitcoin, and one would be an altcoin.  Which one is which is basically up to the community to decide
@_date: 2015-10-08 18:05:26
Exchange diversity and competition is a very good thing.  Another service opening in the US means bitcoin is growing, it increases the opportunity for arbitrage, and since everyone knows the operators they're not likely to run off with customer funds.  
It appears that unlike other failed US exchanges, like Buttercoin, Gemini went the Coinbase route and jumped through the regulatory hoops to stay in business.
I'm really surprised that they opened with such a low orderbook volume though.  You would think the twins could use some of their own BTC to build up the book and give people a better incentive to use it.

I don't think the auctions have had a significant impact on the price. 
Globally, bitcoin markets easily trade more than 50,000 BTC per day.  An auction amounts to dumping maybe an extra half or more of that daily sell pressure onto the market, which would be quickly absorbed in the days to come. 
Bitcoin has had a lot of time to relax from it's euphoric highs seen in late 2013/early 2014.  It's slowly come back to a more stable price point.  Trading volume and transaction volume has increased lately, and I think we'll see the fireworks really begin once the block reward halves again in 2016

There is no such thing as revolution in a subreddit.  You can't call of vote of no confidence.  Moderators can't be deposed.  Your only option if you disagree, is to try to create a different subreddit.   For some this seems trivial, but bitcoin already has a huge head start and may always have the advantage. 
I guess what I'm really asking is, what can any of us really do in the event of bad moderation?  Is our only choice to abandon the same subreddit that brought so many of us here?

The block *reward* is adjusted on a per block basis.  So as soon as a threshold is reached there will be a halving (or ultimately, a termination) of the intrinsic reward.

The system would operate in a decentralized and distributed fashion.  Placing an order would be much like broadcasting a bitcoin transaction.  The order would have to go through a number of confirmations to appear valid to all other nodes and only then would it be executed.  The order could also be canceled by the owner sweeping the address before the exchange matches and executes the trade with someone else.   Just like you can trust the validity of a confirmed bitcoin transaction, no trader would need to trust each other to fulfill their end of the trade.  
I'm not here to iron out those details right now, I'm not going to be the guy who makes a decentralized exchange.  But you're definitely asking the right kinds of questions.
@_date: 2015-03-08 10:25:59
This type of exchange wouldn't be used to trade bitcoins directly for dollars, it's a platform that allows you to preserve your bitcoin in a digital form that's pegged to the dollar.
When you sell bitcoin someone else is making a promise to pay back an amount of credit equal to what you have been given.  So if someone is promising to pay you $500 for your bitcoin, you trade it away and the exchange creates an entry worth $500 of credit in your digital wallet.  
There will be people interested in trading that credit 1:1 for real world dollars if you wish, but overall it's a system that allows bitcoin owners to engage in a market for trading the equivalent of cash without having to touch cash at all

Good question, the buyer is prevented from withdrawing his BTC from the exchange.  (both his collateral, and any btc he accepted for a loan)    If the price is going to decrease to an amount greater than his BTC will cover, there may be a margin call.

So imagine that a decentralized exchange is implemented.  You see an offer to sell your bitcoins for $500 USD apiece.  Great!  So you confirm the order, send the bitcoin and... wait... how are you supposed to get that USD?
The short answer is, there is currently no reliable way to exchange fiat for cryptocurrency without:






None of these solutions are terribly convenient for the person who wants to receive fiat.  However, it is possible to build a decentralized *price discovery* engine for any cryptocurrency.  One could operate like this:




-If the price does indeed drop, they use the credit to buy back BTC, receiving more BTC than before.  
+If the price goes up, they can still buy BTC back, but receive less than before


+If the price goes up, they can pay back a smaller amount of bitcoin to cover his repayment.  (receiving more bitcoin in the end)  
-If the price goes down, they must pay back more bitcoin than they lent out, covered by their collateral deposit. 
If all of this sounds confusing, the TL;DR is that you lend bitcoin if you think the price will drop, and accept bitcoin if you think the price will rise.  Relative lending or accepting pressure can determine the price of BTC.  The "credit" created and destroyed in the process has no real utility outside the decentralized exchange, it simply acts like a placeholder.

This exchange is less about allowing users the ability to trade bitcoin for real world cash, and more about allowing them to convert their bitcoin into a digital asset that's pegged to the dollar instead.  
It is possible for USD credit to be transferred between users.  It can be freely withdrawn from the exchange, and traded 1:1 for real world cash. 
Everyone goes into the exchange with bitcoin.  Depending on the price movements and at what point you choose to buy or sell, you can gain and lose BTC in the process.

I'd disagree.  There was a small but significant run up to the last reward halving in August of 2012 that attempted to "price in" the halving effect.  A variety of other factors caused (including the reward not actually halving yet) caused it to fetter for a few months
But beyond November and December of 2012, the price started to increase dramatically as the pipes were cleared and supply of available coins dwindled.  I remember looking at the MtGox orderbook at the time, the bids were eating up the paltry number of asks and spiking the price every day.  There were again a variety of factors at play here, but the recent halving definitely made a contribution. 
If this pattern holds true, we'll see another significant (but not as drastic) price rise in the months following the next halving at block 840,000

But as long as the ATM is settling bitcoin balances using the blockchain, it's not possible to get one to dispense more bitcoin than it should.

The block reward "halving" every 4 years was a poor design choice, a much more gradual and frequent reduction could have been better, but it's way too late to change now.  The halving increases the risk of huge price spikes every 420,000 blocks, at least for the first few reward eras.  Eventually the price of bitcoin should stabilize somewhat thanks to inflation becoming nil
Many altcoins have changed the number, rate, and limit of coins being created.  It doesn't necessarily make them better or innovative for doing it, but it goes to show that the system can work with a number of different controls.  For instance darkcoin devs favored a model that resulted in 7% reduction of the block reward per year.

Other altcoins follow a permanently inflationary model, check them out.

If bitcoin is programmable money, this seems like an issue that should be trivial for a payment processor to solve.  Allow the merchant to "reserve" a certain amount of currency in limbo that the customer agrees to, then when the actual tab comes they merchant gets their cut and the customer gets and the customer gets the remainder back

You could do Coinbase. 
If you verify a bank and credit card they let you buy up to $100 instantly.  Later up to $1000 if you have a verified account.

Similar topic so it deserves a different reply, but this type of system could have interesting benefits.  
* No one can cheat or steal from the decentralized exchange because there is no "hot wallet" or "cold storage" of funds.  The decentralized network can obey the same cryptographic standards, only letting users withdraw when their obligations are fulfilled.
* It introduces a way to "lock in" the USD equivalent of your BTC.  You can lend out BTC for a given amount of credit, and no matter how the bitcoin price swings up or down, the system will maintain what you are owed.

It might start with Coinbase but this will happen to any bitcoin company that gets traction in the US.  You don't see other bitcoin exchanges running out to say "Hey look at us, we don't ask for ID or care who you are!" Because they'd be liable to get shut down.
Banks, pharmacies, even delivery companies like UPS and FedEx are subject to enormous fines for being lax on illicit activity within their systems.  
This is how American law typically works (especially when it comes to drugs and terrorism).  If you find wrongdoing you don't just go after the actual perpetrator, you go after the whole chain of anyone who helped facilitate the activity. 
Every Bitcoin business with US customers should be playing by the rules to avoid getting torpedoed.  Startups don't recover from fines like this.

Say I'm a guy who wants to sell 100 BTC. 
If I put up a sell order to for 100 BTC at 900, I'm actually putting up a considerable resistance for the market to move above that price.  If the timing is wrong, it's possible that buyers will shy away from fulfilling that order. 
Another option is to break that 100 BTC up into much smaller chunks.  Imagine 50 separate 2BTC sell orders from about 850-950.  In this way I can gradually taper the sells  so that they don't provide as much of a pointed resistance to the price moving upwards. 
Is it possible that the market still might not fulfill all the orders when I want? Sure, but it's better than an all-or-nothing scenario

As the block reward diminishes every 4 years, bitcoins will become more and more scarce, drastically shifting the supply/demand relationship so that demand drives up the price.  Bitcoins are effectively designed to be worth a very high value this way (but it won't happen overnight, it's a bumpy road ahead.)  
The long story short though, is that someday when the block reward is low the transaction fees can be quite an adequate payout incentive for the miners, but we have yet to fully experience this.

The rising difficulty is really a driving force for scarcity. Long gone are the days when you could just leave a mining program running on your computer  all night to acquire a few.  
People who are serious about owning bitcoin are simply going to buy it.  There are only so many bitcoins though, as demand outstrips supply it will be really interesting to see what happens over the next few years!

3 months ago Selax77 of reddit accidentally sent a 30BTC transaction fee.  It was mined by BTC guild.  I was able to quickly find his transaction included within the block, contact Eleutrhia on the IRC channel for him, and get about 25% of that fee (7.5 BTC) returned to the original address. 
It really is up to the mine foreman to decide what to do with it.  In this case BTC guild has a payment structure that automatically pays their miners. So once the BTC was distributed Eleuthria really wasn't able to take it back from them or take a personal hit to cover the guy's loss.  The fact that he did give back any portion of the accidentally sent fee at all is pretty commendable.  
Well see what ASICminer does, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised if they just kept it.

Technically this is more correct than you think.  If the user base for bitcoin grows and more of them are bought over time, their value will increase dramatically with very minimal inflation effects.  When all of the coins are mined, there won't be any inflation.  
Bitcoins are essentially a scarce commodity with a fixed number in existence.  The total number in circulation is increasing for now, but the total number that can possible exist is decreasing as some are lost forever.  The market will always be able to find an equilibrium between the people who want to buy and sell them, but if there is a limited supply...well, I think you understand.

The following is a list of the largest BTC addresses updated 4-12-2013, starting with this whopper of 111k BTC, which [hasn't been touched since November of 2012.](  
It's fun data to peer through, and while not tied to anyone's identity, this kind of info will always be publicly available in the blockchain.  We can see that even the "richest" bitcoiner controls only 0.5% of the total BTC. Can they manipulate the market with this? Potentially, but the market can move without them.  
Now, is it possible that someone has an exceedingly large amount that is broken up into smaller addresses? Absolutely. could they try to force a sell off? Yup, it's a free market. But forcing the market in one direction or the other can be a potentially expensive venture, and not everyone will fall for it.

You're right though, the volume at this particular exchange is noticeably less since bitcoin trading has become more decentralized.  
But with a 30 day volume still up there it's worth noting.
* BTC China - 2,182,600 BTC
* Mt. Gox USD- 1,337,200 BTC
* BitStamp - 1,134,065 BTC
* Btc-e - 1,058,366 BTC

As mining gets more difficult, this is supposed to have an upward pressure on the price (but it is not always immediately felt) 
This is because as mining becomes too difficult for some folks, they're more likely to invest in plain old BTC rather than mining equipment.  Imagine that the difficulty were 100 trillion today and you wanted to buy btc.  It's much easier to obtain it from a market at today's rates versus trying to mine up yourself.

Remember the blockchain is just a 3rd party service that reports figures on the bitcoin network.  Their node might not have picked up your block until just now, or any number of delays might have resulted in it not showing up right away.

25 BTC every 10 minutes on average, but as you "buy" btc the price goes up, meaning the total equivalent of USD created each day for free goes up too.  At $45, this is about.  $162,000 per day created out of the blockchain.
HOWEVER, human psychology comes into play.  People will be hesitant to buy after a certain point because they believe it will come down. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy
@_date: 2013-03-19 19:16:27
Bitcoin is definitely prone to short term deflationary spikes whenever demand outpaces supply and the coins become ultra scarce. 
Here's an interesting graph of the March 7th Drop.  After BTC buyers chewed through the $34 ask wall there was really very little resistance to the price going upwards.  The scarcity of coins for sale contributes heavily to these sudden rises in BTC value.  With little consensus of what price to set a bitcoin at, BTC sellers simply didn't have many ask orders left in the upper 30s and 40s.  
There were definitely warning signs as the price shot up too quickly in the next 2-3 days.  Bitcoin added about 40% in value, then a looming ask wall at $50 signaled a stall in the price climb.  Buzzwords like "bubble" were rampant and many were comparing the current trend to the previous collapse of July 2011.  
As the market became saturated in buys, there was little bid support to form a floor underneath the price.  Relatively small sells had drastic drops in price, and a few sells at the top created an obvious downtrend that many took as a good time to take profit.  MtGox staggered with 14 minute delays as a huge number of bitcoins were sold, Bitcoin lost about 40% in value in a matter of an hour. 
But quick reversals (up or down) don't last.  Any price spike and subsequent drop from a demand crisis eventually has to stabilize.  The market eventually decided to stabilize in the mid-40s.  Demand was still significant enough in this case that the BTC settled higher than its pre-spike value.  Afterwards the BTC continued to bite into ask walls at $48, the enormous one at $50, and once it broke past these there was again little resistance to moving higher. 
The long story short is that over time, the BTC price will become more influenced by demand alone rather than money supply.  If demand grows, BTC grows.  If demand stays consistent, we'll probably find some kind of equilibrium in the next few years as 3600 BTC are created each day.  But halving the block rewards every 4 years means that supply and demand will again shift towards scarcity (and higher BTC prices).  For better or worse however, we're going to have to trust the unregulated market to decide the value.

The TL;DR is the eventually someday, many sources around the globe from bitcoin mining corps to bitcoin merchant business will have incentive to run their own nodes on pretty impressive servers.  These, combined with nodes run by average users can form an impressive backbone that supports quite a bit of transaction volume.

This idea does increase the entropy, but remember that obfuscation =/= encryption.
Suppose word gets out that people are simply re-encrypting the private keys of phrases, well then the searching programs will now simply run a check for various permutations and various levels of plugging in the public and private keys for a given common phrase.  
Provided that your initial phrase is uniquely strong enough to begin with, it's probably not going to hurt though!

I'd still feel better if I can send a transaction in a truly "trustless" manner, without having to rely on a 3rd party that could steal it.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:49:01
I don't think they will, not without a 3rd party escrow service.  The problem is, bitcoin transactions are currently not reversible.  This makes it much easier for scammers to sell fake items and waltz away with the customer's payment.  In an ebay-like environment there is too much potential for grief.

1) Absolutely, but this is a personal decision that should only be made within the boundaries of one's own comfort zone, and with funds that you're comfortable with potentially losing. 
2)  As time goes on, the reward rate for each new block will be cut in half roughly every 4 years, increasing the scarcity (and price) of BTC.  Transaction fees will gradually replace the reward until the year 2140, where block rewards will pay out exclusively from transaction fees and no new coins are added to the system (zero inflation)
3) Lost coins can indeed be lost forever.  Permanently unspent, these make bitcoins even more rare and can increase the value of all others by reducing sell pressure in the markets.

Hmm, but as a U.S. user I don't mind at all.  MtGox customer support over in Japan has been atrocious, and moving money around (especially withdrawals) is cumbersome when the funds are overseas and in a different time zone.  Coinlab should facilitate a much easier exchange.  And US/Canada users aren't being denied access to MtGox at all.  
Also, Coinlab =/= Coinbase.  The latter is the BTC distribution company that has been plagued with order cancellation problems.  
I'd appreciate it if you spelled out some of your fears.  FATCA could definitely be one of them, but if that's all that stands between Bitcoin becoming a legally regulated and trade-able currency in the U.S. then wow, count me in.  
Also, some people might not realize this, but Coinlab will allow big players out there (read: millionaires and billionaires) to make some very large scale transactions.

The market is absolutely freaking out right now.  People make the typical  mistake of seeing a new high jump at 64~  and then they immediately execute a sell order in anticipation of a sell-off. What they don't realize is that the standing bid orders are still way down there in the 59's, so they think they're selling for 64 when they're really selling for 59.  
TL;DR: don't be a dumbass, if you're selling after a huge spike make an open order at the price you want instead of an immediate market order.

There are several ways to get USD in your bank account from MtGox. 
The most straightforward (and time consuming way) is with a bank transfer straight out of MtGox.  Depending on your bank it may cost $20-60 for such a transfer and take 2-3 days.  You have to set this up in the withdrawal tab by providing your info.
Dwolla payouts are also available, this is a little faster, and costs less, but requires you to have both a Dwolla account and a verified MtGox account.  Once the USD is put into your dwolla account, it is trivial and inexpensive to transfer to your own bank (although it usually takes 1-2 more days)
Alternatively on localbitcoins.com you may be able to find someone in your area willing to pay you on the spot for your coins.  
There is also the website  which is willing to pay you in a variety of ways for your coins.

Some solutions are more elegant than others, and perhaps there is a kind of functionality already in there.  What you're effectively doing is first broadcasting a kind of "intention to send" signal in the blockchain.  The transaction has outputs that will refuse to send that transaction to the destination address until a specified time (or number of blocks later) It could be as simple as making the transaction first show up at another address you control before *actually* being sent out to the real destination address or returned.  It might be as complicated as including some kind of signal in the blockchain that the transaction will later reference to confirm or deny.  


I have considered this, and there should be an extra output constraint that allows the coins to be immediately spent to an address that you control.  Prudently. this address has a private key which is on a different system, making the job of hacking 1 wallet the job of hacking many.  Whole chains of addresses could be set up like this.  It makes 
It's like saying to the theif: You can steal the key to my vault, but if you attempt to spend the money there I will know about it and can cancel it.  I can also instantly send the funds to another vault I control.  


This particular idea is not a need to have, you are correct.  But of the many problems that face bitcoin. wallet security is absolutely tops.  Many solutions are coming out from multi-sig to hardware wallets. But none of these change the fact that currently if your private key is compromised, it's too late by the time you are first notified about it.  The magnitude of this idea is that it becomes incredibly difficult for a thief to spend the coins at your address without first notifying you and going through your preconfigured waiting period.  While pending the coins are still spendable by you, and you can instantly transfer back to a failsafe address to protect your investment.

Coinbase is very easy.  They act more like a bitcoin brokerage firm than an exchange, meaning their buy/sell platform is very stable and competitively priced close to the major exchanges (typically bitstamp)

A couple big misconceptions with bitcoin have to do with the idea that there will only ever be 21 million BTC, and the people holding on to their coins are in fact harming the economy.

Halving day is when the bitcoin protocol dictates that the reward rate per block must be cut in half.  It happens every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every 4 years (usually a little less)

The only way I could consider using this is if the funds are simply returned to their owner if one person says the deal is not to their liking. 
Step 1) Bob Decides to sell his 1 BTC for $150, Jane decides to buy that BTC for $150.
Step 2) Both parties send their funds to a trusted account.
Step 3) If both parties agree that the amounts are correct, the escrow automatically pays each person what they want.  If one or both parties decides to decline, the escrow automatically returns whatever funds were originally sent.

Transaction fees are still included in the new blocks that are mined.  So there will always be some reward for mining.  Even after all the BTC has been mined.
The difficulty will always climb to become proportional to the power of equipment that is hashing, so someone will always have an incentive to mine

* About 6-7 batch  units were apparently "sabotaged" and arrived in a damaged condition.  This situation has since been fixed, Yifu claims, by switching to a different shipping company.

I love how these posts always pop up around a big crash.  It's always "the speculators" fault right?
Keep in mind that some traders actually work to stabilize the markets.  They buy if it gets too low, they sell off if it gets too high too quickly.  
You may buy and own bitcoin sure, but a given price point is only as stable as the magnitude of bid orders beneath it.  
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:42:42
You'll notice that when the price goes up dramatically like this (40% in the past few days) the 3rd party bitcoin sellers will usually run out of stock.  This is actually a pretty good indicator that a correction is due, and that it's not necessarily a good time to buy.  
Bitinstant can still be used to put USD directly into MtGox, and localbitcoins might be an option in your area.
Some others options still may be available in the meantime before sellers restock, check out this guide for more info:

Try [ziggap.com]( if you're based in the US, Australia, NZ, or England.  I've used them in the past without issue.  You basically give them a BTC address, make a cash deposit, and it clears very  quickly (usually about an hour.)  
The fees are modest but something to consider.  Services like these are still useful in an up-trending market because if the value of the BTC rises, it's worth more than what you paid.
Alternatively you could try to set up an account with an exchange site and wire the money.
Personally, I can't wait for the advent of Bitcoin ATMs.

Avalon batch  customer here, 
I am neither surprised nor worried by this news.  When I ordered a mining rig in early February the experience was fraught with complications and technical glitches that I dismissed as growing pains of a soon to be popular company.  
It was mid March before I even got confirmation that my order had been placed. 
Agonizing weeks went by, punctuated by newsletters every few weeks or so. Batch 1 wasn't even completely delivered by April.
And then in late May a package finally arrived, almost 115 days later.
Communication and customer service are not two of Avalon's strong suits. They are appreciably under staffed to handle such matters.  I'm not defending them for this decision.  I can only say that the more news they give out to their customers the better.  Silence only breeds FUD, and in the echo chamber of a forum a few hundred unsatisfied customers can make things real ugly, real fast.  It's not just the fact that they gave so much money to purchase these chips, they also perceive themselves to be losing money every day the chips are delayed.  
How will this pan out? I would bet hard money that this is just another delay as usual. I would love to serve as customer relations for them, but I don't think they have a broad enough view to focus on that area.

Brainwallets are fine if you really want to trust nothing but your own memory for keeping this amount of value.  Your password really must be something that no other program or person could ever hope to think of however, because there will always be people trying to scan the easy addresses.  
I find more comfort in paper wallets honestly.  Bitaddress.org is can be transferred to an offline-only computer and used to generate addresses there.  
If you plan on moving funds around or need to buy/sell quickly, then by all means having funds in CampBX with a strong password and 2-factor can also be acceptable.  (provided that you have safe browsing habits)

You're technically correct, but notice the keyword in the article says it's restrained to a *sustained* rate of about 7tps.  Momentarily the blockchain is able to handle more or less, but over time having more than 7 transactions per second will result in a blacklog on current architecture. 
Transactions happen in a matter of milliseconds as they propogate across the network, but what we actually wait for is the confirmation time that the miners crunch for us to make sure that they are recorded in the ledger and are not a fraudulent double spend.

Bitcoin uses an "interpreted scripting" system to determine whether an output's criteria have been satisfied, with which more complex operations are possible
I know that when a transaction is sent in bitcoin, the sender is generally creating output scripts that say, 
* "identify the new owner of these bitcoins as (address here) * and require that they be able to show (private key here) 
* such that these two pieces of information can make an ECDSA signature for verification.  
I also know that some of the more complex operations alluded to here include mutli-sig.  But what are some of the *other* complex operations possible?  And how are they added in?

Unfortunately the GTX titan is so new that no one has posted its hashing speed over at the [mining hardware comparison](
Given the fact that you already know GPU mining isn't cost effective these days, I won't waste your time with that. 
But you might notice that some of the best Nvidia cards will run at 127 mhash/s for mining, while the 7970 runs at 685 mhash/s.  If you're only talking about a 25% performance increase with the Nvidia GPU, it's unlikely to be on par for bitcoin mining. AMD is just plain better at the number crunching.

Think of this like simply putting a fuse on the dynamite.  Currently, there is no fuse.  Bitcoins are spent and then boom, it's irreversible. 
The idea here is that a fuse can allow users to see when their coins are being moved, *before* they're actually moved.  This allows them to correct for address errors, fee errors, and theft. A failsafe could ensure they always have the option to send funds somewhere else in the event of theft. 
Ultimately, it's a system that allows users to know when they're being hacked before it happens and this is incredibly valuable information. 
If the time delay is considered too cumbersome to implement, the second option is to design a system where m-of-n private keys are required, and activating one part of the key puts all others on "notice." 
Again, the end result is to let users know when they're being hacked.  It would completely change the utility of bitcoin from a speculative financial currency into a store of value that's potentially impossible to steal.

In practice, such orders are called stop loss.  There are some bots out there which will sell or buy if the price reaches a certain threshold, but I personally do not use them.  Sorry I can't help with this one.

If SWIFT starts using bitcoin as the core tech, or even just a part of their money transferring service that would be good news.  It sounds a bit silly that they would try to help facilitate bitcoin transactions. Many bitcoiners would respond, "Why do I need SWIFT for that?"  
But not everyone knows how to use bitcoin, and SWIFT would bring multi-currency support to the scene.  I welcome them to give it a shot.

I definitely hear you, but scarcity is also a factor of how much of a resource is available per person.  At a low difficulty, it's easy for you to get quite a bit of BTC.  At a high difficulty, you're fighting for it. 
We're currently averaging 9.33 blocks per hour.  This is putting us on pace to hit the next halving day even sooner, which I couldn't be happier for.  I hope to throw a huge celebration at that point, because when the reward rate is chopped in two Bitcoin will become much more valuable.

Yup, the idea is that you could run this on your computer, even multiple computers if need be!

The big problem is that if you also lose 2-factor, you lose your coins.

No matter how good the security, there are still incidents where the user has gotten careless or unlucky with storing their login credentials.  
If bitcoin insurance came around, Coinbase would basically be bearing the cost for anyone who didn't properly secure their own login info (and they would likely have to increase fees to cover for it, meaning everyone pays this cost)
It would also be very hard to guard against malicious actors who claim theft but in reality have just sent their own funds to another address they control. 
I've pondered this question often, and the real solution to bitcoin theft isn't retroactive measures to insure or chargeback funds, it's preventative measures to make sure Coins aren't spent unless the owner is absolutely in agreement about where they're going to.  
Wallets that can enforce multisig, time delay, or transaction failsafes are the next logical step.  I've currently got a 5 BTC bounty for a wallet that can enforce a trustless time delay on Coins going out.

You are essentially correct, but think of delayed transactions as a different flavor of multi-sig.  I like multi-sig.  It means that instead of stealing just 1 private key, the attacker has to steal many.  But if they manage to do so they can steal the coin instantly.  There is also a slight inconvenience factor if you want to spend the coins. 
Delayed transactions attempts to combine the best of both worlds.  It let's you set up not a hot or cold, but "warm" wallet that has a delay of your choosing.  This means the thief could gain access to your spending private key, but they can't move the coins without fist notifying you and also suffering the same delay you put in place.  The failsafe address could be quite secure, the private key could be located on a different machine entirely, it could be a cold wallet, another delayed address in the chain, or it could even be from an address generated by an offline device, such that the public key is known but private key has never been seen by any connected device on earth.  (meaning you would literally have to crack the address to spend those coins instantly.  
Why would I want my coins in such a vault? It's not nonsense.  For one I would welcome a mandatory delay because it would greatly reduce the likelihood of me sending an erroneous transaction (wrong amount, wrong miner fee, wrong address, etc)  If a thief ever gained access to my system and discovered my private key, they could indeed try to spend my coins yes.  But by design their transaction would first have to broadcast an intention, notifying everyone in the world effectively, including me, that the coins are sent.  If I don't agree with this intention I have a time window to change it, sending it to my failsafe.  This also gives me the knowledge that my computer has been compromised, *before* (not after) my coins have actually been stolen.  I think this is a huge benefit to bitcoin's current system.  Instant bitcoin theft could be a thing of the past.  Delayed bitcoin theft would be possible but difficult.  This gives users a few weapons to fight back.

And because there are only ever going to be 21 million bitcoins, inflation will have a very minimal impact on your investment as we go into the 2040s.  
Even stranger, some coins will be truly lost forever, implicitly increasing the value of all the others by making sure they are never spent.

I have never, ever gambled with bitcoins.  To me it's as simple as recognizing that the house takes a cut, and the odds are stacked against the player (even if its just a slight amount).
What's difficult to realize at first is that the more you gamble, the more likely it is that you'll lose.  BTC is a great thing that can potentially increase in value over time, but it'd be a sad day to sit there in the future, reminiscing over the pile of coins you used to have, saying "If only I hadn't gambled them away"

A couple things:
* It's not really a "bet" that the price will go to zero so much as a failsafe that if the market crashes, they want to be the ones holding all the coins.
* And the orders aren't actually zero dollars, they're just very small amounts
* and it really doesn't take that many people to make it look like that much.  If I have 1 dollar, and I offer to buy all the BTC I can get at 0.00001 per BTC, that would get me 100,000 BTC.  So the "amount" of money near zero looks high

The short story is, now is NOT a good time to get into mining.  There are only two companies in the world willing to sell mining products to the public, possibly a 3rd.  Butterfly labs has botched the process so badly that they are about 7 months delayed and absolutely inundated with preorders.  Avalon is actually shipping product that works but most recently they spiked the price of their products due to a complete lack of viable competition.  Their products are also technically challenging to use and not suitable for newbies.  Both companies have mediocre customer service.

For your sake, I really hope you kept the transaction within ebay because that's the only way it can be disputed.  If you're not going to use paypal, one of the only secure ways to do a like this is by cash in person and preferably in the presence of a notary/trusted third party.  
Step 1) Buyer release payment to the hands of the trusted 3rd party
Step 2) Seller releases BTC to buyer
Step 3) Buyer confirms receipt of BTC
Step 4) Trusted 3rd party releases payment (i.e. cash) to seller
And everyone goes home happy.

They don't need to.  You can literally write down a bitcoin key on a piece of scrap paper and as long as the key is linked to a valid address, the paper is worth the # of BTC attached.  People do this all the time to print their own money in the form of "cold wallet storage"  
What makes the coin secure (and what you can't see from the photo) is that the first part of the address can be seen by anyone and quickly used to check the value loaded on the coin.  The second part of the address is covered up and can be later used to merge the value of those bitcoins to an electronic wallet if desired.  The coins would then become worthless until loaded again.

**[Take a look at this page]( It is a live look at MtGox, the biggest exchange floor for trading bitcoins.  You will notice 3 colored lines.
The green line represents how the price of bitcoins has been fluctuating over time.  It is higher to the right, and lower to the left. 
The orange line represents the amount of people who want bitcoins, and have $ to buy them.  The higher that orange line is at a given point, the more "resistance" there is to the price dropping down.  In other words, the people who are willing to buy bitcoins at $10 a piece will get them before the people who are willing to buy them at $5 a piece. Because the people selling them want as much money as they can get.
The blue line represents all the people who have bitcoins, and want to sell them for money.  The higher the blue line is at a specific point, the more "resistance" there is preventing the price from moving further up.  
You can literally put your mouse cursor at a specific point on the orange or blue line, and it will tell you how many bitcoins need to be bought or sold to get the actual value of the bitcoin to that point.  As you can see, selling $600,000 worth of bitcoins will cause the price to drop quite a bit in this market, because many people's "buy" orders will be satisfied by that!    
When the blue or orange lines are very low and shallow in a particular section, it means there is very little resistance to the price moving past that point, and you should watch out for movement.  It is not a guarantee, but just an indication.  
I hope that helps.

**It's not too good to be true: mining can't/won't maintain those payouts forever.** The people who start sooner get the most reward.  There's a lot to be understood here, but this concept needs to be understood by anyone new to bitcoin mining:
Printing/creating more money devalues a currency.  Because of this phenomenon, Bitcoins have been coded to be created at a predictable and exponentially decreasing rate.  There will only ever be 21 million in existence. Every time a block is found, it currently release 25 bitcoins to the "finder." (this is usually a pool of many miners) The schedule looks like this.
1 block is found every 10 minutes.  
6 blocks total are found per hour.
144 blocks are found in a given day.  
2016 blocks are found within a two week period.
After 2016 blocks are mined, the network will self-adjust the difficulty of mining so that the bitcoins are being mined at this predictable rate.  It often takes a little more or a little less than 2 actual weeks however.
So as more miners plug in more powerful machines, the difficulty goes up.  As miners turn off these machines, the difficulty goes down.  
Every miner the world is basically in competition for that daily payout.  Which is currently worth about 3600 BTC/ $86,400 a day.  They join in pools so that they receive a fraction of that payout.  Don't forget that payouts decrease over time.  About every 4 years the BTC per block payout is cut in half
When you get a mining rig, you are essentially getting a money faucet that will spew out bitcoins over time, but this flow will decrease exponentially over time.  It may not always pay for itself, and it may not pay for itself anytime soon.

I'm assuming you're referring to the problem of how much time it takes the bitcoin-qt client to sync upon boot.  There are some wallet services like blockchain that don't have to deal with this, but for users who want a local wallet on their pc it's a pain.  
Copying the entire blockchain is possible, but just know that it also carries inherent risks.  Make sure you absolutely know and trust who you're getting the wallet from. If a significant number of users download a malicious wallet file, it would be much easier to forge transactions and set up false account histories. 
In the past, syncing the client was atrociously slow.  They've made improvements and hopefully the first time boot will be even quicker in the future

Bitstamp uses it, but I wish I could find a better issuer because the exchange rates (as you can see) are pretty terrible. 
Currently you can deposit BTC into ripple via bitstamp, you can also buy ripple directly with cash and it will deposit straight into a ripple wallet.  From the other way around you can send ripple to bitstamp and turn it into BTC.  Alternatively, you can "exchange" currencies within the ripple client.

That's exactly what I'm worried about.  Even if you keep all the coins you mine, you could still end up with a smaller pile than what you could have just initially purchased.  The one thing we can absolutely count on is the difficulty growing exponentially as ASICs begin to roll out, but whether it's 10x or 100x higher is tough to say.  You can quote me as guessing that it will be 60x from a year today, that's my best estimate.

 if you don't see a problem with this, you go right ahead and use it.  I would much rather trade on an exchange because with the proper security measures there is no risk that my funds disappear.   
Say on this nash exchange you offer to sell a bitcoin for 150.  So you risk your btc and I agree to trade. But I only send $50. Your options are to then either take the money or lose it all.  You would stand to lose more than me too. Its anonymous too so there's no way to track reputation.

For instance, say that I loaned you 5 BTC 6 months ago.  The price was roughly $10 per BTC then, and so the loan would be worth about $50.  Now today if I expected to get my 5.5 BTC back, you would owe me an amount worth roughly $325 at current rates ($59.25 per BTC)  It's too big of a risk for you, and you would likely default.

Sadly you'll take a little hit on the price, but it's better than having to wait on Gox.  
Just as a side note, never ever ever withdraw fiat or BTC out of an exchange by sending it to an account you don't control.  3rd party withdrawals are risky because if something goes wrong, you could end up with a big headache.

Provided that internet access isn't an issue in said country, I'd be inclined to agree with you.  What we really need is a service that offers the reverse of Ziggap or Bitinstant in their home countries.  But as much as I wish it that's not likely to happen.  Converting BTC to any other currency has typically been a time consuming or money consuming process

I'm also assuming that private companies are getting into the game, ASIC chip makers who have no interest in selling to the public.  I'm interested to see how this pans out though, come back in a year and we'll see who's closer eh?
@_date: 2013-04-29 00:20:44
First off, I hardly believe you. I apologize if this post sounds condescending, but it is not intended to be so.
This is not some undertaking you should simply waltz into without an advanced understanding of what you're doing.  If you even have to ask the question (let alone on reddit) whether or not to use ASIC or GPU then it's clear you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.  GPU mining is dead for bitcoin.  It doesn't matter if you invest a thousand or a million dollars into it, the cost of the GPU equipment, setup, and maintenance will not pay for itself.  
ASIC tech is the way to go for bitcoin mining these days, but it is difficult to get a hold of.  If you are absolutely unable to obtain ASIC tech, then GPU can be used to mine for litecoin, which is technically more profitable for GPU's nowadays.  
Only a handful of companies on the planet have offered ASIC tech to the public.  Prices were reasonable months ago when it was a risky venture (and indeed several ASIC companies were either scams or folded due to developmental problems.)
 **BitcoinASIC** is a prime such example of good honest men who thought they could just design their own ASIC chips and failed horribly, taking their mining company under in the process.
**Butterfly Labs** is another example of an ASIC company that proceeded with a poor business model, outsourced most of their development, and ended up with almost a years worth of delays and no idea how to effectively manufacture/distribute their product.  Their lowest performing units are just now beginning to trickle out. 
**ASICminer** actually developed working ASIC tech, but they kept it to themselves and instead sold shares.  Only recently did they auction off some of their chips and they sold for absolutely absurd prices, the buyers are unlikely to meet ROI anytime soon.
**Avalon ASIC** has delivered working 66 GH/s miners, as a chinese company their customer relations have been poor, and they too have been plagued by delays.  Avalon has released an enormous batch of their hashing chips to buyers which will arrive months later.  This means that a number of secondary retailers will be releasing their own version of ASIC miners by the end of the year.  It may be worthwhile to partner or work with someone who has purchased these chips in bulk.  The main forum of users that discuss and own ASIC miners is located here: 
**KNCminer** is a new company that may or may not be a scam.  The upside is that they appear to be legit by accepting paypal (something that is not easy for scammers to do) and they are purportedly offering 100 GH/s units coming in the fall of this year.  The only problem is that the difficulty will be much, much higher by then.  So their profitability is questionable. 
But to be perfectly honest unless you were somehow a lucky preorder from months ago, **now is simply not a good time to get into mining.**  Now you will easily run the risk of paying far too much for a mining setup that will not meet its return on investment anytime soon.  If you wish to make your  *own* ASIC tech it may be worthwhile, but you cannot do it alone, you must choose your partners wisely, find people who actually know what they're doing, and you are looking at a 6+ month development time.  Even Avalon didn't do everything by themselves, they outsourced their chip design to Taiwan Semiconductor Co.
You're probably better off just hedging your bets and buying bitcoin. Coinlab is your go-to place for facilitating very large purchases.

Sorry for the typo earlier, had to resubmit with the correct headline
Highlights of the post: 
* MtGox claims 1 million customers
* Special Holiday Discount of 25% off trading fees between December 20th 2013 - January 20th 2014.  [The usual fee schedule can be seen here](
* Partnership announced with Mayzus, a [Cyprus-based payment processor](
* [Side note, Cyprus is potentially very pro-Bitcoin](
* Mayzus allows deposits from a variety of payment methods and over 126 global currencies, one of them notably NOT being the US dollar, but this increases MtGox's international reach regardless. It could again become the go-to source for non-US bitcoin trading.
* Phase 2 plans to implement Mayzus support for withdrawals as well. 
* For the sake of PSA, Gox also throws in the recommendation to always secure your account with 2-factor: Google auth, yubikey, and OTP card are all good.
The big question in my mind, is whether or not this upcoming support will redeem MtGox, and I wonder how broad their international influence will reach now.

To get a sense of what's happening here.  Say I buy 10 BTC, and I transfer it to my address for 14 days.  This would be equivalent to 140 "bitcoin days."  Now, if I end up moving those bitcoins to a new address, those 140 bitcoin days are destroyed and kept track of in charts like these.  
The enormous spike yesterday shows us that many long-dormant coins were finally being moved, it was a sell off equal only to the June, 2011 crash.  
Personally? I don't mind when these things happen.  It blows off steam and allows coins to redistribute.  BTC will go through many more of these cycles in the future, but the biggest ones will usually be triggered by block reward halving. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:20:27
You can transfer your Bitcoins to an exchange and trade them for fiat if you wish.  MtGox deals in Euro, and you do not have to be verified to do this.  However, I am not familiar with the easiest methods to take Fiat and put it into your bank account in the UK.  
Alternatively, you could go to localbitcoins.com and find people in your area willing to buy your BTC.

The rules referenced are the ones imbued within the address when it was created.  As the Vault Chain continues to grow, it will become progressively harder and harder to re-write history.  
When you go to spend your coins, any claim to spend them is viable but still must suffer the delay.  The you and the thief can continually reverse each other's spend attempts, but at any time the Vault chain will recognize a fail-safe address (specified at creation) where the bitcoins can be spent instantly.

The only reason to do a bank wire transfer into MtGox is if you're dealing with a very large sum of money and don't mind paying the usually high transaction fee.  $40 right?  It's ridiculous.  This is the reason why bitcoin was invented in the first place.  
In the future you can use Bitinstant to deposit USD cash directly into MtGox, then you can trade at your leisure, they will charge a ~5% fee + a $3.95 fee for zipzap. 
Alternatively if you don't mind getting verified you can use dwolla.  Dwolla usually takes 1-3 days to move funds from your bank to them, and they charge $0.25 (yes, 25 cents)

A failsafe address would likely have to be specified in the beginning meaning that:
* if you ever got into a reversal war with a thief
* Or the coins seemed stuck in pending too long
* Or you just had to spend them ASAP without waiting
Then the transaction could immediately be forwarded to this one specific address without delay. If the failsafe is a paper wallet, then a thief would have very little hope of retrieving coins sent there.

Bitcoin has a number of positive attributes that current adopters love, like low fees, instantaneous payment anywhere in the world, deflationary characteristics, and the dedicated developers working on it want to ensure its stability and success.  Any competitor would have to do better.  
Since bitcoins value is now almost entirely determined by demand, a competitor could definitely try to steal some of the demand away.  You can also think of the BTC as being "backed" by the power of the network supporting it, aka the hashrate.

What on earth is the point of DDoSing a pool?
1.) If you successfully shut down the pool, then congratulations, there are tons of others.  
2.) Long term the blockchain will still solve at the normal rate by correcting for difficulty
3.) If your goal is to drive difficulty down, it's not a smart move.  Miners can switch to other pools at any time.
4.) If some incredibly dedicated hacker tried to shut down all the pools, we'd start to see more private and solo mining operations pop up.  You can't DDoS them all. 
5.) You can't even DDoS the blockchain without paying for it.  Miners can switch to only include transactions that have paid.  
It's a fruitless endeavor.

The current inflationary currencies do not like it when people save too much, as it causes spending to slow.  With less overall spending the economy slows down, profits fall, jobs go away, etc.  Inflation tends to discourage uninvested saving because if I just keep $1000 in the bank, it will have less buying power over time.

Simple, things get messy and the practice would be unsustainable.
Let's say the bitcoinstore.com permanently set an exchange rate (low or high, doesn't matter) for their prices.  Let's pick $100 per BTC.  
If the market is higher than this, then people will absolutely not want to shop there because their prices would be higher. The store would lose money.
If the market is lower than this, people would absolutely want to shop there because they could buy more with their BTC, but the store would also lose money because they're offering too big of a discount.  
Free markets allow for prices to shift, and it's far easier just to keep up with whatever the current exchange rate is
@_date: 2013-05-16 16:25:33
You can attempt to describe past market events and it would always sound accurate in hindsight. 
 For instance: Yesterday's market attempted to test the $120 ceiling but failed, causing a slight pullback.  Then the negative news about Dwolla caused an immediate sell off both due to traders losing confidence and some anticipating a sell off so they could buy back in at a lower price.  The market had to find a floor somewhere and indeed past $104 it was hard to go lower.  Price jumps continued as traders bought up BTC either for profit or to transfer out of the exchange.  
Predicting future events is much, much trickier.  But a market is also a case where people will look for obvious "signs" and then act on them, making those signs a self fulfilling prophecy.

Building these miners is not a trivial or inexpensive process.  They can try to mine with some of them to cover the cost, but it is far more likely that they accepted other people's preorder money in order to fund the technical venture. 
Also, if a single company accumulates too much mining power it becomes self defeating.  &gt;50% and the network security is compromised, this is precisely the reason why Avalon chose to get involved when it heard BFL was making ASICs and bASIC folded.

If Bitcoin had these properties, I would not invest in it at all.  I like the idea of BTC precisely because there is a hard limit coded in.  If I didn't like this, I would stick with fiat.


Good luck designing an architecture for that.  Or convincing millions of people to start using it overnight, or coordinating the thousands of devs to release products and services that mesh well with your currency.  Bitcoins rise has been as slow as it needs to be, as quick as it can be, because the system and the implementations around it have to scale with its interest over time


Again, nope.  Ripple did this, and it is precisely why I don't really care for ripple.  If all the "coins" are created at the beginning then the distribution system is either fair, attempting to distribute them equally, or inherently unfair, rewarding some users over others, even those that go outside the rules.  Bitcoins have been and are being rewarded to the adopts in terms of how early they took the risk. 


No that's not the whole idea.  The whole idea is to create an incentivize  a peer-to-peer transaction system that allows stores of value to be transferred quickly and easily.  Miners get paid proportionally to the amount of computer power they put in.  Creating every coin at once would introduce huge problems in determining how much they are worth, who gets paid for what, and no matter what system is in place to attempt "fair" distribution, some buyer could come along and snatch up a vast majority of them, effectively dominating the market and making it worthless.
Bitcoins price fluctuations are necessary and a response to demand over time.  The logarithmically decreasing rewards of the network also show that inflation is decreasing over time, meaning your investment now will see less dilution over time, and thus potentially more value in the future.
This is a terrible idea, and I'm tagging you as "author of the terrible redcoin idea"
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:31:34
I would completely suspect the same thing. Each time the reward rate is cut in half, bitcoin becomes that much more scarce.

You're talking about trying to artificially pulse the difficulty.  Here's why it doesn't work in the simplest sense: **you must convince people to turn off their miners.**
but let's break it down and see what might happen. 
Imagine that right now the difficulty is 3 million.  At the next 2016 difficulty adjustment, for some reason, everyone turns off their miner.  
Well, what then?  The difficulty would be adjusted based on the previous period.  It would expect enough units to be running to churn out a block every 10 minutes.  The only possibly way a block could be solved is for the people that didn't participate, but their hashpower would be measly in comparison to the difficulty.  It might take twice as long for the next difficulty adjustment, even months.  
When the underpowerd miners finally grind through 2016 blocks (way longer than 2 weeks later) all the ASICS turn on and the difficulty is much lower than before, ridiculously low.  Their hashpower finds the blocks so quickly that you may be done in a few days.  Congrats, thats, 2016 blocks or just 50,400 BTC total, and then you're back to waiting and not mining bitcoins during the next few months.  
The mechanism that makes this a non-issue in bitcoin mining is the competition between miners.  If your miner is off, you're losing potential profit, plain and simple.  Pulsing the network doesn't get you any more BTC
@_date: 2013-03-08 00:31:01
Did you see the video earlier where Hitler blew up over bitcoin going parabolic?  Bitcoin is a great idea, but it is prone to having a "deflationary crisis" that is not unlike the exact opposite of an inflationary crisis.  
As coins become scarce, their value goes up, which increases the demand for the, which makes them even more scarce.  Which makes their value go up even more.
Unchecked, eventually the price goes parabolic, which means its near vertical, and people will realize that the amount of money in the market can't possible increase the price anymore because the coins cost too much.  So people sell in droves.  
Yes, I sold everything in the $48's, and I will be waiting for quite some time (at least to see the weekend dip) before I buy back in.

Vibr8gKiwi, you're wrong when you try to lump all traders in the same category and pass them off as harmful.  There are definitely some people who want to profit off of other's misfortune, the kind of people who will force DDos attacks or manipulate the market.  We're not all like that. 
Look I don't care if you've been hurt by the free market or you made a fortune.  Don't make this personal.  You're absolutely right that exchanges can go belly up but there needs to be some kind of consensus system (centralized or not) that creates an trade rate for BTC.  Currently most people have put their faith in MtGox, some people say ripple will make an excellent decentralized exchange (but it has terrible volume at the moment).  Maybe in the future we'll work out a better p2p system, but bitcoin for all its benefits is incapable of deciding its own value, it needs a market to figure that out.  And the best one we have so far is a free, unregulated market.  Don't like it? Make a regulated one and see how many show up at the door. Think we can live without exchanges entirely?  Fine, then abandon them and enjoy haggling with every single person you ever want to trade BTC with.

Based in Slovenia, it remains to be seen if Bitstamp will avoid the technical setbacks and legal challenges that come with operating a sizeable bitcoin exchange.  
Personally I hope CampBX gets it together too, because while they're still small I love the idea of a US based exchange that uses Dwolla, and properly.  It was so darn convenient.  
As soon as MtGox lost dwolla, and now with the 10 transfer a day fiasco, their market share was doomed to plummet. 
If you don't trust any of the above, in the meantime you can try a site like Coinbase, or localbitcoins.com if there are reputable traders in your immediate area.

Ah yes I hear ya, but if that happens then BTC guild will voluntarily limit their getwork to reduce their hashpower share.  They've done so before and they'll likely have to do it again. 
Avalon owners have been using these guilds lately and adding a lot of momentum, but would they switch to mining solo if it protected the integrity of the network? Absolutely.  That's about 1 block every 5 days per Avalon.  I'll take it.

From what I understand you only declare capital gains if you cash out your BTC into USD.  If you recently cashed out this year for instance, you will declare gains on your next years taxes.  Same goes for losses.
The tax percentage that you pay on those gains largely depends on both your income bracket and how long you have held the investment, along with other factors.  If you intend to be a law-abiding citizen, you'll definitely want to consult with an accountant on this one.

I'm willing to wager that with the stupendous delays over at BFL, a 67 GH/s miner has a good chance of churning out 200+ coins over the next year or so (with diminishing returns of course)

It's both good and bad
**The bad**
* it kills consumer confidence in the exchange
* it encourages some traders to leave for other exchanges
* it encourages some traders to sell in the short term
* it prevents people from trading accurately, because they can't actually see the current market price/order book
**The good**
* it stabilizes the market somewhat, preventing the price from rising "too much. too fast" 
* some people like the lag because it gives them clear, obvious points to try to sell, thus buying back later for more BTC. 
But mostly? I think the less lag the better.

I saw a little confusion about this earlier, so a quick clarification for new users:
**ZipZap** is a 3rd party payment processor that works in conjuction with Bitinstant.com.  They're essentially just another middle man and while not totally evil, they take about $3.95 on each transaction, which can add up. 
**[Ziggap.com]( is a competitor to Bitinstant. They also provide direct BTC within an hour or so for cash deposits.  
Honestly? Bitinstant has had some hiccups lately but they're useful for getting USD into MtGox.  If the market is going up however, I like to use Ziggap.  They haven't disappointed me so far, their fees are modest and they have a 4 hour price-lock window, meaning you can place an order when the market is low and by the time you receive it later your BTC is already worth more.

Bots may be seen as harmful to some, but they too have limits and can malfunction.  Ask anyone who's had experience and they'll tell you that the bot is only as smart as the programmer, and losing money is definitely an option.  
I honestly prefer an open unregulated exchange because there are forces that keep things in balance.  Yes the price is prone to overshoot and undershoot its average, bubbling up and crashing down, but volatility in itself has a correction factor.  Too much volatility and we'll see different kinds of users rise to prominence in the market, shifting from weak easily-spooked hands to stronger more confident hands.

This, a million times this.  User-side security can be DRAMATICALLY enhanced by a time delay on when coins are sent out.  After a user specifies whatever time delay they're comfortable with, it would work like this: 
1) Initiate a withdrawal request
2) Email, text, other notifications also go out
3) waiting period must transpire before transaction is broadcast
4) Account owner has multiple means to contact exchange or wallet service to tell them whether or not it was authorized.

Question) Is the end-all point to your arguments something along the lines of "There's no way a Bitcoin based economy could possibly be stable with widespread adoption.  Everyone would just hoard the coins, not sell them, and businesses would collapse because no one would buy anything, no one would get paid because business would not make any money.  Everyone would just stand around doing nothing, waiting for the BTC price to rise."
I've tried to encapsulate what I think it is your position is, feel free to correct me.
I think I can draw a distinction that I hadn't really considered till now.  I can think of innumerable examples where people would rather spend their bitcoin than hoard it, but in all of these it's usually on a necessity.  I think bitcoins would be much less likely to be spent on non-necessary, luxury goods.  
I.e. would someone spend BTC to buy a fish from our fisherman because they're starving? Probably.
Would would the fisherman use his revenue to buy a bigger boat because he wants more fish, bigger business, and more bitcoins? Probably.  Would someone sell it to him because they want his bitcoins? definitely. 
Would someone buy an item like Perfume? Or a boat just for the heck of it?  Maybe not.

Good, so he's spent all his dollars first.  So what happens when he spends all his dollars?  He either has to get more dollars so he can let his bitcoin sit, or he has to start spending bitcoin as the expenditures of life beckon.


I think we can both agree that "hoarding" means not spending bitcoins.  What does investment mean to you in this case?  I am under the impression that investment means buying something in the hopes that it will increase in value.  In a deflationary economy, the medium of exchange is increasing in value.  So buying bitcoins would be encouraged, not discouraged as you say.  
Hoarding and buying bitcoins go hand in hand.  People who want to sit on their bitcoins and not spend them also want to invest in more bitcoins.  They'll convert fiat money like USD into BTC.  


So your prediction is that as the price of the bitcoin rises, we will see fewer and fewer people want to buy bitcoins, and there will be fewer and fewer people trying to start new btc business?
I'd disagree. Just because the price of the bitcoin goes up, it doesn't necessarily discourage investment.  What it means is that bitcoins become less affordable.  An average person willing to invest $500 in btc a few months ago could have bought 100 btc for his investment.  Today  that person can buy about 16.67 BTC for the same $500.  They're still just as likely to make such an investment if they believe that the price will increase in the future.
Also, as the price of the BTC rises, we've seen new innovations in the mining industry with the advent of FPGA and ASIC hashing rigs.  New merchants have suddenly started accepting BTC as a form of payment.  The rise in price doesn't give me any less confidence, if anything, I have more.

Other cryptocurrencies don't have nearly the backing that bitcoin has, so compared to the BTC they might appear more volatile (and perform worse)

Now there is a price jump on multiple fronts, but the big one was precipiated at Gox.  It was an absolutely enormous trade worth at least (if not more) than 1 mil USD in a matter of minutes. 
Such a trade can be taken two ways, either someone is trying to get their BTC out of gox *fast* or someone is trying to buy up BTC while they can still get it cheap.   
Personally I think things are about to get really volatile.  From the orderbook we can tell that technically there is more sell pressure in the short term around the 130-140 range.  And then there is essentially what looks like this *one guy* with a 3000+ buy order creating buy pressure at 125.  So the price is going to bounce around 125-130 until a consensus is reached and once we move past that, serious action.

If you're talking "location" as in a physical space no, it can be very difficult if next to impossible to tell where the bitcoins are physically residing.  
But yes as frozenlock said any bitcoin has a "public" address that it is currently residing in.  this address is not tied to anyone's identity. And some bitcoins are residing at addresses where the private key has been lost by the original owner, meaning the bitcoins are pretty much forever stuck there. Most bitcoiners actually don't mind when this happens, because it's a guarantee that those coins will never be spent, increasing the value of all of the others
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:24:03

This is only partially true.  It's more correct to say that the amount of bitcoins generated is dependent on the processing power used, but that the network is adjusted automatically after a certain number have been mined so that they will continue to appear at the same rate.
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:55:58
As time goes on, the rate at which new coins are generated will taper off, this means the value of bitcoin will be almost entirely determined by demand. The hard limit of 21 million ensures that bitcoins become deflationary.  
The more demand, the higher the price of USD per BTC, and the more purchasing power you get for your bitcoins.  That's why it's so important that BTC are divisable out to 8 decimal places. (and effectively, more can be added)

what might change in the first few months here is that the proportional payout of coins will switch to fewer hands.  Anyone that owns an ASIC will have a much higher share of the 3600/btc/day payout.  
Having more BTC is always an incentive to sell some of it, but if these guys are smart and paying attention to what the price is doing, they'll hold on to their BTC as long as they can.

However, I have one simple suggestion that I hope you've already considered: **Please for the love of all things, make sure your BTC prices are adjusted frequently**
I have seen other bitcoin stores where the BTC/USD exchange rate still appears to be 1:17.  I have bitcoins, I want to purchase items in BTC, but I have no desire to do business with such stores because their negligence in updating prices puts me at a disadvantage.  
**TL;DR** If you frequently update your BTC prices (and there are scripts to automatically do this) to reflect the current market exchange rates, everybody wins!

Bitcoin has a "speculation index" of sorts that monitors how much money is being traded at the exchanges versus how much money is actually moving around the network.  Like all charts, it must be taken with a grain of salt, but here it is: 
What we're seeing is that right now, there's a historically low amount of money being traded at the exchanges relative to the amount of money being moved around the blockchain.  In other words, the BTC economy is bigger than ever
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:10:53
probably the best answer here.  To expand: What's stored in your particular wallet is a public key showing the amount (which anyone with the public key can see) and the private key which can be sent anywhere with your permission (or imported anywhere without your permission.)  It's very important to protect your private key.

Just a side comment here, if the price of a bitcoin were $500 that would mean the total value of all coins created each day is $1,800,000 during this 4 year reward era.

The worker name is generally the specific username tied to a piece of equipment you're running on a server. 
Some large scale mining operations will involve multiple pieces of equipment, or even multiple computers, and the miner generally wants these all tied to his or her account at once, so each worker can be assigned a username and they will all feed back into this one central account for the miner. 
If you're very new and want to just try out GPU mining for fun, I would highly recommend 50btc.com.  They have a user-friendly interface and a helpful guide to get you started.

2.) [This bitcoin wiki page does a very good job dispelling some of the common misconceptions about the digital currency.]( The rest of the wiki might have what you're looking for too. 
3.) [The economics section of the bitcoin forums is a great place to ask questions]( But take everything you read with a grain of salt, there are some whackos out there.
Bitcoin has thus far proven itself, but it is still new, and it is risky in the sense that the community is still actively determining what the value of a bitcoin is.  Many people will tell you that the value of a bitcoin will ultimately pan out to be astronomically high (somewhere in the thousands) and they may be correct, but I believe it will be a long time before we get there, and not before enduring a number of quick rises and crashes in between.  
The *one advantage* of btc that I do trust in is the hard limits on inflation and the eventual 21 million btc limit.  Also, bitcoin itself is basically dedicated to the idea of maintaining and using a master copy of all the transactions that ever occur within it, and users have a very vested interest in preserving the integrity of that master ledger.  The developers have done an excellent job in designing the cryptography of the system to the point where it can be found trustworthy.  While the system of sending/receiving transactions can be trusted in fairness, just remember that users themselves can't always be.  No one is going to reach into your wallet and steal your BTC, or forge BTC into existence without some very complicated and difficult attacks, but there are definitely other ways to be cheated out of your money that simply involve bad or unlucky decision making.

Furthermore, doing so will not "kill" bitcoin.  It simply will crimp one of the many pools that is used to mine for blocks in an effort to ensure that no one pool accumulates too much hashpower

1) Most basic bitcoin wallet programs can only hold BTC, not USD.   If you want a website than can hold both, you basically have to go through an exchange service like Bitstamp, CampBX, Kraken (technically MtGox but I don't recommend them)  Etc. 
2) Your coinbase wallet is capable of sending and receiving bitcoins, any of the address here can feed into yours.  Make as many as you may need.

The TL;DR theory is that setting a low inflation rate means people will have their money decrease in value over time, thus giving them incentive to spend it sooner.  
Bitcoin is deflationary when the economy (demand) for it is growing.  It is more prone to deflationary price spikes driven by scarcity.  But keep in mind that it is still new, and some inflationary forces still apply as it is being created.

I see most of them going to BTC-24
There's an interesting dynamic at play here.  Many people have "cashed out" most of the available funds in the markets.  MtGox alone had about 12.4 million USD available when the price was about 260, Now it has 9 million available (and more from unlisted funds).  So for the time being, many of the USD holders are just sitting this one out, watching and waiting.
But overall bitcoins themselves are easier to move in and out of exchanges.  The smaller exchanges also have less cash reserve on hand, so they'll quickly become saturated with extra BTC in a sell-off, driving the price lower. Panic sellers will be itching to cash out any way they can.  
And that's the nature of the price war, how much coin is sitting in the hands of unwary holders waiting to bail?  How much coin is sitting in the hands of bitcoin bulls, being hoarded?  How much USD is sitting on the table, waiting to scoop up the easy coins?  It will be interesting to see it play out in both the short and long term

Nope. When ASICs arrive they will shift the mining power from the hands of many GPU and FPGA miners to a few much more powerful ASIC owners.  It is not the end of bitcoin as we know it, the network will actually become more secure and harder to subject to fraud as the total hashpower rises.  In time, more ASIC manufacturers will arrive on the scene and the number of ASIC owners will rise.
@_date: 2013-02-12 01:48:48
Psychologically, there are a couple factors that determine people's tendency to buy or sell.  One is of course the number of the price, but the other is just circumstantial evidence surrounding the time period.
Take a look at this chart for instance 
It shows the two most precipitous drops being around $19 USD and 21 USD.  I don't think there is anything inherently too significant about those numbers, but after a certain point of trending up, populations can get scared and will move to sell, taking profit in an effort to protect against loss.  As you can see from the past month though, the majority of activity has been directed in the buy direction.  
I would not be surprised if people are selling, and then immediately turning around to buy again.

These aren't as good of passwords as you'd think.  Try thinking even more creatively.  
I'd like to design a wallet that either 
A) requires input from  multiple sources before sending funds
B) enforces a mandatory time delay on transactions before they can be broadcast, giving the owner time to react
C) Ideally, both. 
It's not easy, because it has to be implemented at the cryptographic level and in such a way that can't be circumvented.  If successful though, it will essentially turn bitcoin into a store of value that's nearly impossible to steal.

No, you certainly aren't required to run the original bitcoin-qt client, it's just the original wallet. 
(People who want to support the network can choose to run it, because it forms a node that relays the transactions.  Unlike running a miner which solves blocks and verifies transactions, running a bitcoin-qt does not pay you) 
Because the client syncs the entire blockchain the first time you run it, this is why it sometimes takes a day to download the whole history the very first time you turn it on.

You will have far more success withdrawing the bitcoins and selling them for fiat elsewhere.

(the exact value of which, you will have to sign an NDA not to speak about) 
But yeah, Mtgox's withdrawal process is a little messed up right now, and until they find a better bank it will be far easier to withdraw BTC

You know how they say bitcoin accounts can't be seized?  It's technically true.  As long as you know your private key, the internet exists, and someone in the world is mining, your bitcoins will still be there.  This is what makes bitcoin itself so difficult to shut down.  User account's can't really be seized, but the whole USD bank account for Dwolla that MtGox used for US customers definitely can.  That's what the article is conflating here. 
Now, someone could also beat you over the head with a wrench to get your password... if that counts as seizing bitcoin then we're screwed.

simply put, the mining era is changing drastically.  We're getting to a point where all of the technology that has been used in the past to "mine" is becoming outdates by a newer, faster tech called ASIC.  For the time being, there is no tech on the horizon that we see being able to replace ASIC.  So you really have two options.
1.) Try to buy an ASIC miner
2.) Don't bother
Mining can be technically challenging to set up.  I recommend the above link as a beginners guide, but some of it may be outdated now. 
What you should realize is that it's very difficult to say how much you'll be making with ASIC miner.  Each is powerful, but the network will adjust it's difficulty depending on the amount of power added to it (it does this to prevent inflation) so that there will always be an average of 144 blocks mined per day.  In this 4 year epoch, that translates to 3600 bitcoins per day. This payout is cut in half every 4 years.
So when you buy an asic miner, you're buying a faucet that will spew out money, but that flow will also decrease exponentially over time.  And it can also break. And it will suck up power too.  There are a myriad of reasons why it might not be the wisest investment for you.  But that link up there is a good place to start

I see it as simple human psychology. Eventually the value of your money will surpass the value of something you want in a deflating economy.

I mean to say they haven't fully tapped their market.  There are a lot of people out there willing to give them money in exchange for shares, it's just that many had no idea how to go about it.  They can use more startup capital to obtain more asic mining equipment, and thus more profits.  Since I ordered Avalon however, I don't particularly care, I just think its a shame.
@_date: 2013-06-07 11:45:12
Stopping the transaction isn't so much of a problem.  In an alt-coin we might imagine that all transactions have the option to first broadcast an "intention" of sorts before the money actually leaves the wallet.  Say that we changed our coins so that they must look (and find) an intention made &gt;24 hours ago and no new one since.  If it can't find it they make a new intention and do not send.  If they find one within 24 hours they make a new one, overriding the last, if they find one made &gt;24 hours ago the coins successfully send. 
All this basically means that your coins can have a delayed send function before they actually leave your wallet.  This does not give you the option to double spend (or send and chargeback payment) but it does give you the option to tell everyone in the world that there is a delay on those potentially sent coins, and it gives you time to change anything should it be wrong.
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:56:12
I've always been curious about designing a program that basically lets you put a delay on your coins going out of your wallet.  
Think of it like adding a longer fuse to a stick of dynamite.  Currently that fuse is instantaneous for bitcoin, and that doesn't play well for everyone.
Folks desiring a higher level of security could create an address that requires a delay, and if someone breaks in and tries to initiate a withdrawal (even knowing their private key) this will give them time to act and transfer to a safe address, even cold storage if need be.  It would look a lot like this commercial.  An app on your phone or computer would notify you of an outgoing transaction.  Did you authorize this? Yes or no.  Theft prevented. 
It gives you all of the benefits of having a hot wallet, with the backup of cold storage security.  Most importantly it will tell you if your computer is compromised without having to suffer the loss of your BTC.

@_date: 2013-10-17 16:22:57
Allow me to offer the countering opinions to the above post. 
To be sure, I'm a long term bitcoin bull.
One thing you have to keep in mind is that Bitcoin is actually still experiencing a period of moderate inflation here.  Roughly ~3600 BTC are being created each day, and you can multiply this amount by the current exchange rate to get an idea of how much new value is being created daily.  At an exchange rate of about 140 USD/ BTC, this means roughly $504,000 worth of coins are being created out of thin air by the miners. 
Miners and existing bitcoin holders determine the sell pressure of the market.  The higher the price gets, the greater this sell pressure appears.  If the exchange rate jumped up to say $300 per day, then $1,080,000 worth of BTC would be created each day.  Current bitcoin holders would also see the value  of their holdings grow significantly.  If the price rise is too rapid and the outlook is uncertain, then people will simply begin to start selling their bitcoins because they think it's overvalued.  If the growth is slow and steady however, it will be much harder to justify a rapid sell-off. 
**EDIT:** For an interesting look at what happens when there are too many coins compared to buying interest over a long term period, take a look at what's happened to Litecoin these past few months: 
Their difficulty has decreased as well
 
Is bitcoin necessarily headed in the same direction?  Not exactly. It's primacy has granted it the favored status, but demand absolutely needs to outpace the sell pressure in order for there to be growth.  Otherwise it will settle into an equilibrium before the next 4 year halving period changes things up again. 
@_date: 2013-02-27 04:34:52
My typical advice for US customers:
If the market is trending up, I highly recommend a cash deposit service like [Ziggap]( which has minimal fees (about 3.5%) Due to the security of depositing cash with a trusted institution, the transaction will clear very quickly (on the order of minutes to hours)  IF you get lucky, you can catch the market at a low point, place your BTC buy order, and by the time you receive your BTC it will already be worth more than what you paid for it.
If the market is definitely trending down, I recommend using bitinstant's cash deposit service to place USD on a MtGox account.  You do not need a verified MtGox account to trade, or withdraw Bitcoins.  While bitinstant has slightly higher fees ($3.95 zipzap fee + 3.99%)  You end up with USD in MtGox, which you can use to execute a trade for bitcoins at your leisure.  In this way, it is possible to get more BTC than you could get by buying from a service like Ziggap, even with all the fees.  This BTC does not have to stay in MtGox, you can transfer it out to an offline wallet.  I generally do not recommend buying BTC straight with Bitinstant, as they seem to have had supply problems in the past
If you don't mind waiting (for about a week), and don't mind the possibility of your order being cancelled (I mean, who does?) You can try coinbase, which has a spotty record but overall is a legitimate company trying their darndest to supply BTC.  Their main advantage is much lower transaction fees.
localbitcoins are hit or miss depending on your area.  You may find a trader that is willing to give you a decent amount of BTC for your cash, but their rates are rarely if never better than the current market price

My advice is to hold on to your bitcoins as long as possible, until their value affords you something that you simply cannot refuse.  That is the way of things.  There will definitely be fluctuations.  You may be able to sell them and then buy more if the price dips lower.  You may get left in the dust as the market climbs and climbs.  But that is your risk.
But keep in mind that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.  Right now 10.7 million are in existence.  Inflation is tightly controlled in bitcoins up to that point, and once all 21 million are mined, people will truly begin to understand just what a "scarce currency" it can be
**TL;DR: No**
@_date: 2013-02-27 15:16:41
I don't know why you're getting downvoted, since it's true.  Running a miner basically coverts electricity into BTC, which you can sell at your leisure in the future.  How far in the future and how much with the price of BTC be?  That's your risk, and it's a pretty low risk to pay.

There only appear to be 52,000 bitcoins available on MtGox at this moment.  
If tomorrow, Mtgox announced that it had finally cleared up it's withdrawal process, you can be sure that loads of bitcoins would appear for sale there, practically crawling out of the woodwork because traders would dump BTC there, withdraw fiat, and pump it into another exchange to buy low.  
Not saying that's going to happen tomorrow, but as long as coins are scarce there (and the fiat withdrawal process is snail-worthy), the price will steadily climb.

I like how you chose a picture of the price back when it was $40
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:13:46
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted, this is an excellent question.
Bitcoins are sometimes called "the perfect bubble." But a more accurate description is that they are an artificial, fungible, verifiable, exchangeable, practical store of value that has both a hard limit and no theoretical maximum.  
In plainer terms, they are prone to demand spikes.  When they become scarce the price goes up, which makes people want them even more (and this makes them even more scarce)  
There are a huge number of factors feeding into this current demand spike (which arguable may or may not have just finally popped)
* Back in December the block reward halved, this occurs every 4 years and since less bitcoins are being made now, they become more scarce and less prone to inflation.  Yes I said inflation.  As long as bitcoins are being made they are prone to some small level of inflation, at least until around 2140.  
* One of the main contingencies of people interested in bitcoin is the miners.  Back in december a number of companies were supposed to bring new technology to the market: the ASIC mining device.  Due to complications, several of these companies either failed or delayed, causing a very limited number of actual ASIC miners to be released so far.  In fact, only one company in the world, Avalon, has currently been successful in releasing these to the public.  The huge number of investors that were scared away from the mining scene turned to simply investing in bitcoin instead (which it turns out, wasn't a bad investment at all)
* As the market price rose, a number of companies sprang up offering bitcoin services and several companies (like satoshidice) posted huge earnings.  These also made bitcoins more desirable.
* The FinCEN announcement earlier in the year fell on mixed years but was mostly positive news for bitcoiners, who saw their currency gain legitimacy for the first time in the political spotlight.  In other words, people became less afraid that bitcoin was going to get attacked by the government (at least for the time being)
* As the price rises, so does media attention.  And bitcoin drew in a larger and larger audience as it burst through certain price levels.  (first the all time high, then the billion dollar market cap, then the $100 mark, and then the huge 50% run in the past 2 days.
* This kind of rise can't continue forever.  We all might like to think we're rich but the buying power of the BTC is only as much as someone willing to pay for it.  When anything becomes overbought, it means that there is little support below the price to contain a huge sell off.  When a big holder decides to finally cash out, it affects everyone immensely and a cascade of events can change the price.
* If you look at some of the Major sell offs of bitcoin over the past few months (starting with the big March 6th drop from 49.09 to ~33) they've all been driven by MtGox's inability to support a high volume of traffic.  This last episode has been particularly disastrous.  How bitcoin users proceed from here will be important, because some are deluded into believing that this kind of parabolic rise will last forever.  They literally believe that BTC will be $70,000 by the end of the year.  Right.  Many will blame MtGox instead.  And some will just see it as a correction that was long due coming.  
either way, I doubt bitcoin will die off, it may very will continue to live.  But in a free unregulated market, there will always, always be demand spikes like this to contend with.

@_date: 2013-09-17 06:13:35
To be perfectly honest OP I think this is a fantastic idea, but it's not currently possible with the bitcoin architecture.  I would love to see a kind of script that turns coins back into having "coin base"-like behavior (unable to be spent for X number of blocks) 
I've been dreaming up methods that would let users lock up their coins for a period of time or allow delays fuses to be safely put on them (to thwart instant theft attempts) We're tossing around some ideas in this thread 
But ultimately your best bet is to simply put the coins on a paper wallet, and then put that paper wallet in a vault of some sort (yours or a banks) with instructions not to open it for a specified amount of time. 
You can even split up the coins into "m of n" keys so that if an attacker found out one of the private keys, they couldn't get in without finding others. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:59:20

Bitcoin.org was also already up and running for anyone to use by 2009,

@_date: 2013-10-14 03:18:34
I'm a long term bitcoin bull, but I would encourage everyone here not to be completely unreasonable.  Markets rise and markets fall. 
It is certainly possible that bitcoin can increase in value, but also possible that it can overshoot it's equilibrium point and bounce around for a bit.  You should also plan for some kind of contingency that a dark cloud of news will cause a sudden knife-like drop in the price.  Not every market movement is rational. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 15:34:30

Just my standard response now: 
**[Ziggap.com]( has a fairly good track record.  I've used them on a number of occasions without complaint.  The coins typically arrive within the hour, sometimes within just a few minutes after a deposit is made.  Their fees are modest, at about 4.49% the current market rate. 
**Coinbase** I used to recommend due to their lower fees, but long wait times, strict limits on bitcoin purchases, and poor customer service has turned me off lately.
**Bitinstant** is still pretty useful if you're looking to put USD directly into MtGox.  I've never had a problem with them for that purpose.  But lately they've had issues with having BTC in stock

Have you ever thought about why this is?  If you can't beat 'em, Join 'em.  There's a time and a place for any form of communication, but people are more likely to understand an image rather than a wall of text.  Why do you think the dumb mspaint ad got so much attention and directed so much traffic here?  
My fear is that if we really start disallowing certain types of posts, it will cut a huge swath out of the people already interested in and potentially interested bitcoin here.  
Memes are a neutral form of communication, not categorically good or bad.  I would imagine you're largely pissed off by what you see as trivial, uninspired, dumb or misinformed memes.  Great, anyone should be.  
So encourage the good stuff.  Clever infographs and witty images can do more good than harm. And if you create a wall of text that's an intelligent discussion, I'll upvote that too.

But I think having one no-holds-barred subreddit is crucial and helpful.  Why?  Because posting freedom is important.  The ability to upvote and downvote what you see is designed to community moderate the info here. I'd rather the community come across as an eclectic mix of opinions and ideas rather than a bunch of closed minded snobs who tried to force one group out.

Are you sure you're logging into the same account?  
I guess so if your transaction history says you've purchased 2 coins.  But if there's nothing in the log after that, then your 2 coins should still be there.  If they were transferred out then it would show when.  It sounds like a glitch with coinbase, and while I can't speak for them I hope you get it sorted out.

In theory you probably *can* remove an address from your address list, but trust me you really don't want to.  If someone sends bitcoin to that old address, it may be permanently gone for good and unable to be spent by you.  There is zero risk to just leaving your address in there.

I think you need to just chillax.  A pool getting &gt;50% does not mean the end of bitcoin, it just means they have an increased chance of executing a very specific type of double spend attack.

When you buy a miner, you are buying a money faucet that will decrease its output exponentially over time.  It will also require power, and it can break.  Here's a good starting guide

On the bitcoin talk forums I noticed that several avalon users were talking about solo mining.  Jeff Garzik finally posted a tutorial on how to do it (which I cannot find at the moment) 
But if you're an ASIC owner, solo mining is definitely an option.  You'll end up finding a block rougly once every 6 days right now, depending on your tolerance for variability, that can be okay in the long term.  25 BTC + transaction earnings (all yours, no fees!) can be an attractive offer.
Either that or p2p pool mining is now in vogue.

Your internet connection is generally not a factor, unless you have the misfortune of being charged by your Internet service provider for the amount of bandwidth you use per month.
Also, take a look at [The mining hardware comparison page]( over at the btc wiki.  Plug those hash rates into that calculator I showed you to get an idea of how powerful/profitable the various machines out there are.  Also, keep in mind that in the near future the difficulty will climb exponentially as more and more ASIC miners are brought to market.  This decreases the payout for everyone else.
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:01:26
The actual "buy" order that someone just executed was much larger than 3894.  
When someone wants to buy or sell, let's just say 10,000 BTC as an example, each price point that the order chews through will be reported.  So you'll see lots of little orders and a few big ones all at once.  In this case there was one seller who had one big 3894 ask order at $63.787, so that was bought up as part of the big buy order too.  
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:25:11
This is far more important than people realize.  In essence, it means that certain entities are capable of "policing" the bitcoin network, and stolen funds can sometimes be tracked/returned.

Which you're right, quicker block discovery *should* mean quicker adjustments, but what if by that time the network hashpower has already increased so much that *again* the block reward time is happening every 5 minutes?
I agree with the main sentiment here that this process obviously can't continue forever.  But if these two week intervals keep happening every 1 week on a consistent basis we're bound to see a much sooner halving day.  It's not like the network will suddenly want to make the average halving time every 20 minutes just to compensate.  It has no awareness of time, it's simply trying to adjust to 10.

Technically I hate to say it but bitinstant is one of the fastest ways to get USD into MtGox, you could also try to find someone locally who deals in BTC at localbitcoins.com.

I've found myself using bitinstant preferentially, but I'm annoyed with the daily $500 limits, so I want to try Dwolla.  
This morning the first time I used bitinstant the funds cleared and were available in MtGox before I had even came home from the store.
The second time I used bitinstant I got home, waited over an hour, and saw nothing on MtGox.  I sent their customer service an email and within about &lt;20 minutes I got a response saying it went through, and indeed it was available on MtGox then.  
The 4% fee + 3.95 is fair, but I'm still searching for a better way.

2 things: 
1) this title is wildly inaccurate and misleading. People can still sell bitcoins, as they are doing now.  You're linking to a forum post where a user is having trouble getting bitcoins to show up on MtGox acciybt. There are a number of reasons for this.  In my experience BTC deposits can take a bit of time to show up in MtGox, but for me its normally never more than an hour.  (usually 10-20 minutes)

I'm part of the Avalon preorder Batch  that is slated to be shipped in March.  I could probably write about my nightmare experience of what it was like to try to get into that pre-order batch, but I doubt anyone is interested in that.
However if you're looking for specs, Jeff Garzik was the first to receive his. This is his blog where he's already posted a couple updates/photos from his unit. The big news is that Avalon is pushing around **66 GH/s at 650w** when tested.  This is both an impressive hashing rate and a higher than expected power draw.  
Jeff has an active presence here in the bitcoin forum as He's a nice guy, and responded to my PM a few days ago but I imagine he's pretty inundated with contacts right now.
Also, I was able to dig up a pretty low quality video of Yifu Guo (the designer) running his unit. 
I will review the crap out of my Avalon when it arrives, but until then I imagine quite a few other people will be posting theirs when they arrive throughout the month.  Jeff got his priority shipped.
Also, [this particular corner]( of the Bitcoin forums is particularly active with pretty much all things ASIC these days. If new information surfaces, it typically comes up here first.  Yifu from Avalon, Josh from BFL, and a host of other notables typically post in these forums.  I would encourage you to take everything you read there with a grain of salt however.

Sorry to hear that.  It's totally up to you where you take your business, but as a first time customer I'd send them a quick email and see if they can fix the situation for you.  The sad news is that they're running a business where they send out irreversible BTC transactions to customers who can pay with reversible bank charges.  Up to 20% of all of their transactions are actually attempting to defraud them, so they have to be very careful and occasionally the good guys get caught in the net.  I'd give them at least once chance to make it right, because this was clearly a decision made by an automated program rather than a person. 
Beyond that, getting to a verified status with them is very convenient.  Being able to buy/sell 50 btc instantly has its perks!

There are a lot of stories about the 2011 crash.  It's important when sifting through the facts to note that the market had already reached its peak and was going down by the time it was hacked.  Someone physically access the MtGox computers and was able to drain several thousand BTC from the market by putting in false orders.  Although MtGox honored to repay this lost BTC, it still shook confidence in the market.  
What caused the initial peak in July of 2011 was of course scarcity.  The price eventually jumped about 70% in a single day, going from $18 to $32.  Imagine waking up and seeing a $180 BTC price and ending the day at $320.  At the time, many investors decided that growth was unsustainable given the current demand, and they pulled out.

Thanks for the input.  I truly believe that the best way to implement a system like this is with an existing bitcoin payment provider (or online wallet service)
It would be a disaster in my opinion, for another 3rd party company to step up to the plate and offer to store your bitcoin wishlist without actually having a record of your BTC in their accounts.  The wishlist would hold no clout with merchants.  They would effectively say "So what?" when the numbers are waived in front of them.  Even worse, another 3rd party company would want a cut of the profits, creating another middleman in the pathyway that exchanges BTC for goods.  
But if a wallet service can show that they are storing the customers money *and* the customers have told them where they want to spend it, the bounty would be a real attention grabber.  
Imagine walking up to a merchant like Steam and saying: "Hey yeah, our customers have about $2.1 million worth of bitcoin that they want to give you for your games.  We take the BTC and you take the cash, can we work something out?"
The neat perk for bitcoiners is that it's totally voluntary. And it's a way for them to use their own spending habits to help influence merchants to accept the currency. If you add to your wishlist, it makes it easier for merchants to see the benefit of also taking BTC.
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:44:12
Yes, the price is 75 BTC for 1 unit.  It's not too crazy of a price either because the device itself will spew out BTC once turned on.  It's very likely that you'll make 75 BTC back within the next 6 months, and then some.  
I'm a batch  preorder and interestingly, I paid 75 BTC for my Avalon as well, different US price back then.

I would seriously discourage you from seeking out prices 10-15% below market rates, they are most likely a scam.  
If someone is really willing to sell you BTC for that low, well then it's their loss.  Market rates try to set a fair price based on current economic conditions.  If you want to pay less than that, your only hope is to try to wait and see if the price dips any lower.  
Realistically speaking, how many bitcoins do you actually want to buy?  Coinbase has pretty decent rates and once you get set up you can purchase 50 BTC a day.

People had the false anticipation that the market would "correct down" over the weekend, and then trend back upwards on monday once bank deposits cleared.  Simply put, it's easier to sell BTC than it is to send in USD. 
The truth is, it takes a lot longer for bank deposits to clear than just monday.  mine took 5 days once, not a weekend.  In the meantime speculators have had fun with the dips and troughs, but they're playing with a market that doesn't have a net influx of cash support.  So over time it will drop, and drop some more, and they'll speculate lower and lower each time.  The end result is a self-fulfilling prophecy falling at greater and greater velocity.  
granted, the market doesn't tolerate movements that are too fast in either direction.  So eventually the free fall will snap back as there a sudden overload of users and their USD just sitting there, looking at the low price and suddenly they start realizing they can buy back in.  
Are we out of the woods yet? Nope.  We've gotta wait most of the week to see what effect bank deposits will have.

Unfortunately the bubble has to pop sometime this year. The price may still go up, but it simply cannot cannot cannot continue to increase at its current rate. Why not? Because otherwise it would end up at $70,000 per bitcoin at the end of the year.  Those kinds of numbers are simply not feasible to sustsain so quickly with human psychology.  And also, 3600 btc on average are still being made each day.
What's more likely is that we will far overshoot bitcoins equilibrium value.  And then begin a weeks-long logarithmic slide back to baseline before the cycle starts again.

They would need to have &gt;50% of the current network hashrate to create a forked chain.  (good luck with that) Furthermore, the community "votes" by choosing which bitcoin-qt clients to run and mine on.  So if paypal somehow set up an ASIC farm with vasts amounts of power to run an alternate blockchain with scummy rules, no one is obligated to use it.  We could stick to our existing clients.

Good god no.  
Wait until there's at least a working video of one showing the exact specifications.  Supposidly BFL is planning on releasing this soon.  
But if you order now there is no chance of a refund, and you'll be placed very far behind as there are literally thousands of preorders ahead of you.  
Unless you have a preorder or buy someone else's preorder for a decent price, now is not the best time to get into mining.

The height of a wall represents the amount of resistance the price will encounter to moving past it.  
*  'bid walls' are made by buyers with USD who want BTC.  These slow the price from moving lower
* 'ask walls' are made by sellers with BTC who want USD.  These slow the price from moving higher
The most important thing to remember about walls is to always take them with a grain of salt.  Unless you have been watching the market recently, sometimes significant walls can be [artificially placed by anyone with enough funds to do so.](  
Another good place to look at the market depth over the past 24 hours is to use [coinlab's chart](  But sometimes it has been known to look glitchy if there has been a lot of recent volatility.

Now is simply not a good time to get into mining.  
* if you buy a GPU or FPGA miner, it will not recover its cost anytime soon, if ever.
* if you preorder through BFL, you will not receive an ASIC anytime soon.  The months upon months of preorders are ensuring quite a backlog.
* other ASIC companies are popping up out there and it is difficult to determine which are legit and which are scams.  
If you reeeeeeaally want to get into mining, you could try to buy someone else's BFL or AVALON preorder.  But I don't recommend it unless you get a great price, and pay via a transaction method that can be disputed.

If you're just looking to buy coins, use a service like Ziggap, or Bitinstant.  Both services are reputable and very quick. You make a cash deposit at a local bank or store, and bitcoins show up at the address you provide within an hour or two (sometimes even quicker than that.) 
If you're selling bitcoins, consider fastcash4bitcoins, which has somewhat of a sketchy name but is indeed well regarded.

It took time for the programs that enable GPU mining to be written.  The easiest solution would be to start a botnet of sorts.

The idea is to make this trustless.  In the same way that no one entity or person is in control of the bitcoin ledger, this vault chain would be a distributed logbook that people could edit but no one could forge once the history is written. 
It would look very similar to a bitcoin blockchain, with blocks to be found and extra transaction fees to be earned.  When transactions are logged within it, the distributed Vault Chain would enforce the delays and then forward them to the bitcoin blockchain when appropriate, ensuring that no one could try to spend your coins earlier or to a different address than what you specified.

Well yes and no.  If the world were so simple that everyone just hoards bitcoins then you're right, we'd be going nowhere.  
But bitcoin hoarders want one thing: more bitcoins.  And they'll do interesting things to get them.  They'll invest in mining.  They'll buy bitcoins, and they'll sell things in exchange for bitcoins.  In a way, they too are helping the market grow.  And someday when the value of their bitcoins becomes high enough that it tips their psychological scales and they realize they want something that their bitcoins can give them, they'll spend them.

If you think about it, the current valuation is exactly where it ought to be.  People are engaged in a price war over deciding whether they want to buy or sell BTC at a certain value. 
The trend we're seeing lately is that more people want to buy it, but there's not enough to go around and fewer are willing to sell it.  Prices are creeping up due to the scarcity.

I see it as a simple distribution problem.  The market's making a solid move, there's a surplus of BTC, and not enough USD in people's accounts. 
It's fine by me though, I think the BTC needs a little pressure release.  If it drops down now, even just a small amount, people will be less likely to suspect a bubble.  If it drops down a substantial amount, then we can change from weak hands to strong hands.

I'd like to think that Satoshi didn't exactly disappear, but simply assumed another anonymous identity and continued to work as just another quiet dev on the project.  We encounter Satoshi every day, we just don't know it and probably never will.  
His last post was a build that he wanted to share "before venturing into more complex ideas."  I don't know about you guys, but bitcoin was just taking off then in December of 2010.  It was his brainchild, and whether he knew its magnitude in that  moment or not, I'm not sure any of us here would be so quick to abandon a project like that.  Not in it for the money, there's probably a big reason why a huge chunk of the first mined coins haven't moved in ages.

The original Bitcoin QT is generally considered the most resource-intensive of all the wallets.  Some people prefer it for security purposes (as it has a few more robust functions) but if you're on a laptop I wouldn't recommend it.  
By now you've probably seen pages like  that help you choose a wallet.  Multibit is a comparable offline one that's less resource intensive.

But personally, I hope that you never do this again.  Fair fees encourage stability.  They help prevent rapid high frequency trading, panic selling, and irrational markets.
Furthermore, **I know that security is your top priority,** and I know that as a BTC exchange user with options, I put my funds into the hands of people I trust the most.  
Yet there are *still* sophisticated attacks that can leave us vulnerable on our end.  Some java exploits for instance, have facilitated external  unauthorized MtGox withdraws.  Example of what happened to one member: 
**Q** Would you consider exploring additional layers of client-side security that protects your users from theft?  Some sites like Walletbit have 3-factor authentication with a "secure card," that holds their unique codes.  Some of us wish to take the maximum precautions.

OP might be referring to the fact that many, many important bitcoin services (like exchanges, mining pools, and online wallets) give users the option to be protected by google's 2 factor authentication.  These days 2 factor is a pretty mandatory security layer.  It's probably not a big worry but if some idiotic court order forced google to remove it, there'd be an ice storm in hell. 
Just off the top of my head:
and many more all have the option for google authentication

The online wallets do not store the coins on your computer in any way.  Think of it more as a online gateway to the blockchain itself, which located on the decentralized network of all the computers running bitcoin nodes.  
It is possible to sync the online wallet with an offline one yes.  Under the "My Wallet" section of the Blockchain.info, go to the "import/export" tab and then find "desktop sync."  If you're running the desktop client as well, then it will pair these accounts.

Big drops tend to coincide with very big paywalls.  The price can creep up to this hazardous territory and once investors realize that there is a huge hurdle to going any higher, they're more likely to bail if the price starts dropping.  
Last week I noticed someone playing around with a 19,000 btc paywall in the low 20s.  It was an illusion of course, and was removed once the price got too close, but whether by coincidence or design the market definitely shied away from the paywall more than once.  Some people make buy and sell decisions on such things, but not everyone.  
I'll give no concrete predictions here, but you'll notice a pretty big paywall developing at 30.  Psychologically, this is an important number, and many BTC loyalists will think "holy shit we've never been higher than this before." 
With that cushion gone, there's less comfort.  And where there's less comfort, there's more of a tendency to sell.

If you can get past the sometimes incorrect russian to english translations, 50btc is a pretty respectable pool.  I've never had issues with it, and their 50miner is pretty user-friendly too. 
What will change in the years to come is the ability of these pools to include transaction fees in the block payouts.  Currently, sites like 50btc do not add these in, but as the block reward is halved and halved again, there will likely be a growing pressure to do so or people will switch to other pools for better payouts.

Good points yeah.  I can see how you might get the feeling of being ignored.  My only guess is that things that  require immediate announcements (like the service going down) warrant a response here.  Trying to answer every question or complaint on reddit would be a monumental task at this point.  Their user base has exploded over the past few months as Gox has been hemorrhaging customers.  With only 6 employees and 220,000+ users I bet their team is already flooded with support requests.  Still, that's not necessarily your fault.  
They seem to have improved a bit from earlier in the year.  At least, it appears so because as a longtime vet I remember earlier in the year when a lot of angry/frustrated customers would come here to complain.  6 months ago you would [see posts like this]( (it honestly looks like Brian Amstrong, their founder, responded to that one)
So there are less public rants now, and it looks like Coinbase is trying to increase their staffing as well.    Hopefully whoever they hire for customer support can do a badass job.

This is a curious phenomenon, at first glance it looks like someone successfully tried to mine a block without any transactions included.  It's usually not done because mining pools want the most money possible (and thus want to include transaction fees into blocks too)
My guess is someone either wanted to find this to prove a point, or it's a glitch and the node was unable to compile any transactions when it found the block.  
This is all just speculation though, I'm sure we'll see some interesting commentary on it.

You can think of it as a measurement of how old coins are when they are moved or spent. 
* If I spent 1 bitcoin that had been sitting around for 7 days at an address it would cause 7 bitcoin days destroyed. 
* Similarly, if I had spent 7 bitcoins that had been sitting around for 1 day at an address this would also cause 7 bitcoin days destroyed.
When a lot of bitcoins days destroyed appear it means either a ton of coins are being moved, or old coins are being moved, or a ton of old coins are being moved.  Hence, the DPR seized coins probably had this effect

I groan a little inside when people re-imagine bitcoin as a great wealth distributor.  It's shifting power away from the current financial institutions and putting it in the hands of wealthy techies, sure, but there's a darker side.
Bitcoin mining is a technological arms race.  A very stiff competition between quite a few people competing for a daily slice of the free BTC pie.  You can imagine how quickly it's changed in just the past 4 years.  While ASIC is the ultimate culmination of mining tech so far, the ASIC chips themselves will be refined from 110nm to 28nm to beyond.  And even then, companies like ASICminer will begin to sprout up and attempt to dominate the blockchain for themselves.  This is simply the way of things.  
It will always be easier for a corporation to pool it's resources  and build a beastly miner than for average joes to jump in with their home equipment.  Why? Because no one can prefabricate ASIC tech at home.  It takes a massive undertaking to do so.  
While we will always be able to mine here and there for a few bit scraps per day, I fear the future holds nothing but different power mongers holding the cards.

These kinds of changes would be optional: only made by the creator of an original address.  There are TONS of unused features in the blockchain protocol that just aren't used because the wallets haven't been programmed to easily interface with them yet.  
The point is that you don't have to make a special case address if you don't want to just like you don't have to move your coins into cold storage if you don't want to.

First off, if you're a new user [this Bitcoin Magazine article]( does a pretty good job of reviewing the various online and offline wallet options.  There are many, and you're probably better off just using the most popular and well-renowned version.  
But the offline/online wallet debate still has a few things to consider:
Online wallets 
* have the advantage of being accessible anywhere there's an internet connection.  
* They also integrate nicely with mobile devices.
*  for instance, is a popular online wallet.  It does not actually store your coins, or your password.  It is only a web-gateway to your coins that in theory only you can access.  
* Know that if the websites server ever goes down for some reason, you may lose access to your bitcoins. 
Offline wallets
* Are run like a program on your computer, not through a web browser.
* There is no risk to losing access to your coins if your internet connection, or a website server is down.  
* The biggest risk to your coins is if someone infects your computer with a virus that can steal your wallet.dat or a keylogger that can steal your password
* The offline wallet can (and really should) be backed up frequently in case the computer crashes.  If your hard drive dies, your BTC is lost.  Most offline wallets have a button that easily creates a backup of your wallet.dat so you can pop it on a USB.  Don't lose it and don't share it!!!

This particular question is not my area of expertise, as I'm not a programmer.  But on here is Jeff Garzik, a key bitcoin developer and the first recipient/customer of an Avalon ASIC.  He's a friendly/busy guy and I'm sure shooting him a quick message wouldn't hurt.  
As others have pointed out, the real profit Satoshi (whoever he/she/they may be) could have acquired was the ability to mine bitcoins in the early days.  Assuming they did, all they had to do was sit on them and wait to see if bitcoin became widely adopted.  Satoshi may have gotten burned in the initial bubble back in 2011, maybe not.  But since its inception the opportunity to mine coins has been open to anyone, and Satoshi wouldn't be the only early adopter to profit from it.   People will argue of course that even today we are the early adopters, but that remains to be seen.  


I'll agree with you, the people using BTC as a short term investment tool are short sighted.  I'm in bitcoin for the long haul.  The *very* long haul.  I've seen what happens when the block reward halves and I'd like to see what happens the next time in about 4 years, and after that too.  
I have no doubt that fluctuations will come in the future, but the community has grown large and diverse enough that when the price dips down too low, there are those who will be more than willing to buy it back up.  
Another interesting point is that as the value of the bitcoin rises (and continues to do so) it becomes a desirable trade medium for merchants.  Already we've seen many new sites like pizza for coins or bitcoinin.com, or [a hundreds of others]( 
These merchants help move bitcoin away from more than just an investment tool to a useful tradeabe commodity. When people are willing to give you things for your coins, it's a positive reflection of a burgeoning economy.


You'll often encounter the argument that it's better to simply not spend coins now because they'll be worth more later.  You certainly can take that as sage advice.  However, consider the USD money in your wallet now.  You could have just converted that to bitcoins and sat on that too, but you didn't.  The point is you'll always need to spend money for some reason or another.  Psychologically, this is the biggest defense against the "sit on your bitcoins forever argument."  Sure you may own bitcoins and sure the price may rise, but someday you'll see that the value of your bitcoins is more than adequate to purchase something you desire even more.  Nobody wants *just* bitcoins.  They want what bitcoins can buy.

Now, I know of a phenomenon where sometimes if you import a wallet and don't know what you're doing, some of the BTC will arrive and the rest will go to another address as "change"  
I would talk to both blockchain.info and also ask other people in the bitcointalk forums about this.  You might have done something when you downloaded and moved your wallet.dat

Very interesting!  Thanks for submitting a primary source OP.
I think his comments toward the end about still being a valid legal exchange, albeit with payment processing being hampered, are extremely interesting.  I'm basically prepping myself for three distinct futures:
Possibility 1) Bitcoin is truly banned in China in every sense of the word.  The PBOC backtracks on every front and basically forbids exchanges from operating there.  Large platforms like okcoin and BTCchina would see their volume dwindle, or they would just put up a brief and sudden "we're closing, withdraw funds now" notice.
Possibility 2) Chinese bitcoin exchanges persist in a gray period of legal ambiguity.  Not quite illegal, but severely cut-off from financial liquidity.  Their volume here would dwindle too, but the world may react differently saying "Oh, I guess it's not banned after all."
Possibility 3) Somehow, someway, the chinese exchanges re-establish their deposit methods as the PBOC comes out with more official clarification.

I had my finger on the trigger to buy in when the price dropped at $34, but I didn't want to be blinded by greed.  It was a scary time right then.  How low would the price go? 30? 20? lower?  In the end I decided to just wait it out and see what happened over the next week or so.  (I had a vacation to go on anyway)
When I got back, I groaned as I saw the $50 ask wall crumbling.  There was little resistance past that.  The market still wasn't satisfied.  I lost a few BTC but maintained my earnings in the meantime.  I bought back in at 50 and rode it up to 70.5.  Not only did I just cash out, but I transferred the money out of MtGox this time.  I'm gonna sit this one out till it cools off

Given the fact that your linked picture does not work, I can't tell you.
I know what a batch  Avalon receipt *should* look like because I have one myself.  No, I'm not posting mine, not even blacked out.  It has a QR code and a very long order number.  You can contact Walletbit, give them this long number (which consists of letters and numbers) and they can tell you if that order has indeed been paid for and the address it's heading to.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:07:55
It would be a neat idea if I had coins in a particular wallet and could somehow "lock" their next destination wallet.  
Imagine 1 BTC sitting at a particular address, the "protector" program will prevent those BTC from being transferred to any other address except one I specify.  Ideally they would have no clue what that next address is.  Thieves essentially would have to hack not just one, but two addresses to get your coin.  If such protection were enabled you could set up a whole chain of addresses that the BTC needs to go through just to be "spendable."

Butterfly Labs is one of only two companies in the world who are currently claiming to be able to deliver ASIC mining devices direct to the public.  Unlike their competitor, AVALON, they've done much more marketing and a pretty good job about getting the word out on their products.  
The difference is that they've been befuddled by very long delays.  Initially they were promising to have units shipped as far back as October. No one has a BFL unit in their hands today, and the current projected ship dates are mid February, which I myself remain skeptical of.  
**TL;DR - Took way too many preorders on a complicated, unfinished product, customers rage after broken promises.  Will they still deliver? I think so, but not without PR backlash**

Pricing would most likely (and unfortunately) fall to the second biggest exchange: BTC-e.  I say unfortunately because that exchange has persistently lower BTC prices because the users there trade in alt-coin.  It means the overall buying power of BTC would be less.
Pretty much every merchant from Bitcoinstore to localbitcoins.com relies on a central exchange to set their prices.
I wouldn't be so quick to count-out Gox though, they've literally been to hell and back, and there's a reason why they're the oldest and most used exchange.  I personally see bitcoins fate tied to Gox for the moment.  If it fails and fails badly, the price will absolutely faceplant.

Transaction fees will always be included.  You're speaking of years past 2140.  If the bitcoin is still used by then it will likely be VERY highly valued, so even small fractions of a coin could be used to pay miners fees and these would still be valuable.
@_date: 2013-02-23 06:25:01
Oh cool, good points for once.


I for one, would rather live in a country where my money sitting in a bank became more valuable over time, but hey that's just me.  I'll go into these advantages as I respond to some of your other statements.


I'm inclined to partially agree with you.  If everyone in an entire country were using bitcoin, these would be the risks.  There would be intense pressures to hoard, but the daily needs of life also beckon for spending.  My thinking is that human psychology over needs will prevail.  Sure people will want to save their bitcoins as long as possible, but eventually something will tip the scales and they'll want to spend them for something else.  After all, no one wants bitcoins, they want what bitcoin can get them.  And I highly doubt that anyone would starve to death rather than pay for food they can afford.  I would agree that loans in other currencies might do poorly, but what about BTC loans?  Websites like btcjam.com have already sprung up for that purpose.  I'll be closely following what happens there.  As a bitcoin owner I would still find myself in need of (and willing to repay loans) But if I knew the value of the BTC was inflating with time, I would be less inclined to take out such loans.  I see this as the country incurring less debt.  What place do you see for bitcoin in the world?  As an investment tool?  


Businesses, just like everyone else would surely be inclined to hoard bitcoins, but you're forgetting that hoarders also want one thing: more bitcoins.  If I'm a fishermen, you can get that I'll be going out day to day to catch fish and sell them for more bitcoins.  Will I sit on my earnings? I think so. Will I use them to buy a bigger boat if I think that will help me bring in more fish per day?  (and thus get more bitcoins?) Yup, it's a vicious cycle.  I don't see businesses grinding to a halt because they don't want to spend any money.  I see them coming up with new ways to get bitcoins out of consumers hands.  Innovation.


That's something I don't have a straightforward answer to.  As much as it perplexes me, several solutions come to mind, and none of them are easy or perfect.  The government definitely has a vested interest in collecting revenue somehow.  It could try to force individuals to use one central address, but this would be easy to circumvent.  It could try to take inventory of an individuals possessions, and charge them a tax based on it, but this too could be circumvented.  It would likely have to force legitimate businesses to add a sales tax on top of their transactions, and it would still be possible to tax individuals based on their registered proprety (homes/businesses/etc)  Additionally, specific government run services like utilities could simply charge in BTC. I can't claim to have definitive solutions to the tax problem, but I'd wager that it would be possible for a government to fairly collect revenue from BTC somehow.  


This analogy is lost on me.  Try to take it a step further.  Imagine for a second that due to a government mandate, every business was required to accept BTC in the next year or so.  The people of Nauru would begin to convert their wealth to BTC and when it's all said and done, let's just assume for a moment that they're no richer or poorer as individuals, they just have BTC now.  They're not quite at the mercy of anyone.  Let's assume for a moment that the price of the BTC is about $30 USD.  In Nauru one can buy a fish for a 0.03 BTC at that rate.  Say speculators drive the price up to $100 USD?  Well, the people of Nauru have considerably more incentive to visit the US now.  They can purchase a great deal more imports, and that fish, well now it just costs 0.009 BTC.  The laws of supply and demand have kept it in check.  Granted if merchants do not update their prices as the BTC changes value, it would be a mess.  But if they do, well then it's all the same.  


Interestingly, let's say Nauru was our adopted country, no one could "invade" them and steal their BTC now could they?


Yup, instituting a national currency that is artificially scarce will protect against devaluation from overprinting.  At first the people of Nauru will be just as wealthy as they have always been, having converted their native AUD to BTC.  But as the BTC community grows and the price increases they'll see their buying power in the world increase.  Massive cost on their economy? I think not.

Doesn't Ziggap.com work in Australia? I've used them here in the states and they're pretty reasonable.  You can buy bitcoins at about 3.2% over the market rates, and when the market is in an upswing you can even time your orders so that by the time the BTC is released to you, it's worth more than you paid.

I'm pretty sure you could find this fault with any site that's become popular enough to be a central point of access into or out of the currency.  
The beauty of bitcoin (and something you could never do with other currencies) is that you have the power to be your own bank, easily transferring the funds into an account of your own.   You can keep the BTC on your computer, phone, on a website, a physical object, or even just in your head.  
As time goes on and we see more services pop up, it will be less likely for bitcoin to have any one central point of failure.

This is not the question you should be asking *after* just buying. I remember when Butterfly labs promised that they would deliver an ASIC miner by ~~October~~, ~~November~~, ~~Decemeber~~, ~~January~~, February at the latest.   If you look at their "final" production schedule they're already having manufacturing delays.  
BFL's main problem now is that they've taken way too many preorders.  How many other people do you think have put down the meager amount for a Jalapeno and thought "Oh I'll just test the waters with minimum risk on this one..." I'm not going to criticize you for doing it, it's a great prospect, but there is no indication to say you'll be getting a box in the mail any time soon.  
My best guess is that they'll muck up something else in February, pushing their initial preorders back to March.  March will actually deliver to a few customers, but by then everyone who got screwed by bASIC going under will have preordered and BFL will be absolutely inundated with orders until the end of the year.   
Meanwhile Avalon will likely have shipped their mere 300 units by February and will continue churning out a small amount.  In other words, good luck getting an ASIC miner anytime before June.

@_date: 2013-05-25 16:19:03


The problem is that in order to achieve this goal, they'll either have to sell  the XRP or give it away for free. Both are problematic.  Selling it will cause the price of XRP to fall steadily as the market is flooded with extra supply, making it an undesirable asset to hold.  Opencoin will also become wealthier in the process.  Giving it away for free is also an issue, who gets it?  How can it be distributed in a truly fair way?  Inflation will also be a concern again. 
The core issue here is that you simply can't create all of a currency at once.

@_date: 2013-03-28 07:01:16
It's very tough to say.  The first drop was around March 6th when BTC maxed out at $49.09 for the day.  It lost 40%, but gained back ground within a few hours, and after a week it broke past this new high again.  
The 2nd big drop in the past few months was at $74.89, it recovered in about two days.  As we move ever higher, the daily mining payout of 3600 is becoming more and more valuable.  That's currently about $330,000 a day.  BTC will have to find an equilibrium somewhere.

That being said.  I'm really glad I got mine back when it was $1,500.  I think part of that price was due to competition and the lower value of the bitcoin back then.  The game has changed now that confidence in BFL is shaken.  Good luck folks.

@_date: 2013-04-16 23:58:11
It's true that owning &gt;1,000 BTC puts you in an exclusive club in which there cannot be more than 21 thousand members.  
Going up the logic chain, owning 10,000 BTC means you own 1/2100th of all the BTC
And further, owning 100,000 BTC (which is exceedingly rare nowadays) means your fractional control is 1/210th of the entire market cap.  The market will continue to fluctuate up and down based on the remaining amount of coins, but holding your share outside this makes the coins all the more scarce (and the price can rise as a result) 
In the longer term as the value of your BTC rises (this goes for anyone) you'll see an incentive to simply spend your coins and release them back into the market.  This will relax the market and the process begins all over again.
Problem? Nah, you're going to spend them eventually.  Nobody wants just bitcoins, they want what bitcoin can buy for them.

Of course, you don't just increase 22-fold value in 3 months without face planting on the way back down.  This is what happens when a commodity gets scarce.  Instead of a central authority it's almost entirely controlled by users, and the decisions to buy/sell/hold can quickly get emotional and develop in hive-mind like patterns.

What I'm pondering at the moment is the magnitude of effect this will have on the network itself.  I'm sure it won't happen overnight, but if you think about it almost all the 25 TH/s you see in the current difficulty is due to GPU's and FPGA's.  As the difficulty climbs into the 40 and 50 millions my current GPU will only be making 0.03 bitcoins **per month** with continuous use.  Laughably bad.  There will be a turning point when a lot of the old tech will leave the market, so it will be interesting to observe the change in network hashpower over the next few months.

That does sound pretty lame.  Why would they possibly be forcing you to sell 118 BTC?  They have so little liquidity that would easily move their price down 7 or more dollars.
Also just a side note, Coinbase is pretty great but they should not be used as an exchange service for day trading, you would rack up too many fees doing that.

You may have selected the "cash deposit to MtGox."  What this means is that you will literally be sending cash to the MtGox website, and the USD will show up in your account there.  You can then buy bitcoins as you see fit depending on the market price.
If you're actually sending cash to a bitcoin Address, I believe you can essentially just calculate whatever the MtGox market price is minus the fee, and that should be approximately what you'll receive. It is kind of weird that they wouldn't at least lock the price for you and show you the amount of BTC you'll get.
@_date: 2013-10-07 12:03:24
The largest bitcoin address in existence is about 111,111 BTC (1933phfhK3ZgFQNLGSDXvqCn32k2buXY8a)
So it can be certainly ruled out that he's keeping it all at a single address. I'm curious how they *know* that he's hiding 600k BTC.  I suppose the most obvious explanation is an encrypted wallet file that they can't unlock but they can see the balance of.

To be perfectly honest, Coinbase is more of a bitcoin brokerage service than an exchange.  They will hold your BTC for you.  They will buy/sell BTC between your wallet and fiat bank account, but you should not be flicking BTC back and forth using their service.  The 1% is competitive, but much more expensive than an exchange like bitstamp, campBX, BtC-E, or MtGox would provide.  
If you're just interested in owning Bitcoin, sure use Coinbase. 
If you want to be a trader, sure you can use Coinbase to buy BTC quick but THEN transfer it to an exchange and trade around with it.

ASICMINER could be even bigger if they just did a better job of getting the word out. Everyone thought it was dead when the GLBSE market closed, it's been virtually impossible to get shares unless you know someone personally now.  (and I highly doubt the shareowners are willing to sell)
@_date: 2013-02-23 06:42:07
The short answer is maybe, but it's not very likely.
A billionaire could try to disrupt the market tactically by forcing bubbles or precipitous drops.  But in both scenarios the billionaire will end up having to make a lot of costly trades.  Large scale buying or selling even on the MtGox market involves slippage.  Making a bunch of small trades would be more likely.  But suppose the ultimate goal is to crash the market so that it has no value. The billionaire ends up spending a lot of money to do it, and/or will end up with a lot of worthless bitcoins in the end.  
If they get really lucky, they'll buy up bitcoins into a parabolic spike, then just as everyone else is buying and freaking out at the sudden price gains, they could sell and cause a crash.  But this crash might happen on its own.  And no doubt many people would sell out for a profit on the way up, taking some of the billionaire's money with them.  The BTC community could profit from any kind of price fluctuation, leaving them with more money to spend on Bitcoins if the Billionaire's ploy failed.  
But one safety net is that there is a large, diverse, and dedicated "community" of BTC buyers and hoarders out there.  They will be more than willing to sell if the price is falling, they will be more than willing to buy it low so they can get BTC back.  Many of them are mining to create BTC.  
If the billionaire is attempting to buy a huge amount of coins just to destroy them, it's like a gift to everyone else.  Their own BTC just became much more valuable, because now there's a guarantee that a certain fraction of the 21 million will never be spent.  Bitcoins become even more scarce, and any demand increases the price more than usual.

transferring BTC out of MtGox to anywhere (like a wallet) is free.  I ALWAYS recommend sending the BTC to your own personal wallet first and THEN sending it to another 3rd party if desired.  
NEVER pay 3rd parties directly out of your exchange account, use this for trading currencies only.

Hmm weird, I just used it to buy MtGox USD and that worked fine.  It literally processed before I could drive home in 10 minutes.  
I think there's less risk of using bitinstant in this way because you're not relying on them to have reserves of BTC, you can do that for yourself on an exchange.
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:39:51
Not really.  I trust the market to take care of itself.  As time goes on the coin base (literally what it means) reward rate will diminish and transaction fees will take over.  
We're talking decades from now, but as this process moves ahead, bitcoins will also get ridiculously scarce and difficult to obtain, meaning their price point moves much higher if their usage grows.  
Ultimately, miner revenue will be tied to the strength of the BTC economy itself.  More tx's = windfall profits, less tx's = smaller payouts.  If less people want to mine, they will drop out and the difficulty will adjust until it becomes more profitable to do so again.  
There will always be someone who wants to mine.

Sadly this is true.  MtGox is often looked to as the price leader, up or down.  Arbitrage accounts exist between the exchanges too, meaning people are sitting on all kinds of capital all over the exchanges, just waiting to make up the difference and equalize the price. 
What's different about MtGox is that it currently holds the most USD.  It's fairly easy to transfer BTC into other exchanges, but we'll have to wait until Monday to see what effect the opportunists will have.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:56:14
Maybe getting into debt is a terrible idea, and putting savings into a deflating commodity/currency is an investment all in its own.  
People attempt to take out BTC loans all the time.  In an uptrending market it's a terrible idea.  
You can also try to make money off BTC dropping if you think it will go down.  This is called "shorting the price" and it's an agreement to pay it back when they think the price will be lower in the future.  Check bitfinex.com for instance.

They probably haven't removed the code yet but they may soon.  Personally I have no idea what the outcome of this scenario will be, but there will be a fair amount of pressure to restore the MtGox Dwolla link.  This was a HUGE chunk of Dwolla's Business, and Chris Coyne probably wants it back.  Likewise Gox. 
I don't know if it has to go to court but if it does Gox will probably end up paying a fee before restoring it.  If dwolla payments are truly gone forever, then Gox may see it's market share decline significantly.  
The worst of it though is that if the majority of users are actually deciding to exit MtGox we'll see an inverse crash, where the price will appear to be increasing on Gox (as people have to buy BTC to transfer out quickly) but on other exchanges the price will try to drop, only to get confused by the price rise on Gox.  The real "crash" will be in volume, which leads to increased volatility as there is no longer a significant USD floor to hold up the price there.

Mycelium apps can read the QR code and send funds when you enter the password (neither the code nor the p-word is stored on the device)  Change bitcoins from partially spent addresses are even returned to the same address!
It's secure because the private key isn't even stored on your phone, and if someone sees your encrypted QR code they still can't crack it without knowing the password (which can be insanely hard to guess if you incorporate long enough or special characters, including unicode.

If you want to sell your bitcoins for cash, MtGox can do a bank transfer withdrawal.  It takes about 3-5 days, there are max limits per day (unless your account is verified) and there is usually a $10-45 fee associated with such a transfer. 
If you *really* need cash quickly,  can connect you with people in the area that are willing to buy your bitcoins directly.  You can can avoid fraud by dealing in person this way.  People will usually pay you a little less than the current market price of a bitcoin, and rarely, a little more.

If you cash out for a profit, you haven't lost anything.  If the price drops, then you can consider buying back in for more market share than you started with.  If the price rises, you have lost only the potential to make more money. Think with a cool head, don't get blinded by fear or greed.

Bitinstant has an option so that when you make a cash deposit they can instantly transfer that to MtGox. (for a fee)

I can tell you one thing, right now there is a huge big imbalance in the way BTC is converted.  It's fairly easy to buy bitcoins, and even convert them back into USD for instance, but it's not so easy to take your BTC and get it back to cash in your hand.  There are hurdles, fees, and delays abound in this process.  
If someone made this process simpler, they would have a huge demand.  The problem is, I believe such a service would take quite a bit of capital just to start.

There actually was a bug like this once in the early days, but the developers (expectedly) quickly tamped it down and the correct blockchain took over. 
This is exactly what would happen again today.  As long as the blockchain exists, a singular version bitcoin will never have more than 21 million coins.

Suppose you bought $50,000 worth of ASICminer blades today. Your net value of fiat is about 420 BTC.  Each blade will output 10 GH/s for 3.5 BTC, so you could buy about 120 Blades for a total output of 1,200 GH/s.  (assuming you could even get your hands on that many) 
At the current network difficult rate, that kind of hashpower will earn you 9.18 bitcoins per day, or 279 bitcoins per month assuming no difficult increase.  It's possible you would make your return on investment within a few months, but it's also possible that the network difficulty could absolutely explode exponentially and seriously cut into your profits.  
Take a moment to consider just how awesome of a sum 420 bitcoins is.  If I had 50k lying around I would just buy them flat out.  No messy hardware that's losing its value, no technical glitches.  Just you and bitcoin pure and simple.  It is definitely possible to lose money by mining.  ASICminer Erupter blades are also NOT newbie friendly.  Be careful out there!

Bitcoins are a hybrid between a digital commodity and a currency.  They have the characteristics of a commodity because people like to speculate on its value, and like all good commodities there is a truly finite supply.  Yet BTC can act like a currency too because unlike gold, they are very easy to transfer and divide up. 
Many different websites nowadays will accept your BTC in exchange for goods and services.  There are places like the  or  if you're looking for electronics or books.  
Then there are places like  which let you buy theoretically anything over the internet with your coins.  
You may also wish to just save your coins for later if you think they will grow in value over time.  This is somewhat similar to saving old coins in the hope that they appreciate in value due to scarcity.  In the case of BTC however, they can become scarce *very* fast

While I am capable of pre-ordering a Single SC or the Avalon Equivalent, for the time being I'm comfortable simply letting my money rest in the mtGox market.  It's doing more for me there than it ever could mining.  Markets are just mass exercises in human psychology.  If there's one thing I can count on, it's that a great many of people expect the price to rise right now.  (Long Term)  
Come back and let me know when you first get your ASIC, we can compare investments at that point and we'll both be wiser for it.

Coinbase would be fairly easy to just import the private key (either by scanning or directly entering it).  The wallet there is more newbie friendly because they pay any transaction fees, and they could also sell the BTC or buy more later if needed.

Best of luck to you! This isn't my area of expertise but perhaps one of these "send bitcoin via sms" services can help.  I believe both blockchain.info and coinbase support these.  (you need a US based bank acct to purchase BTC there however)
@_date: 2013-02-20 21:29:40
That I cannot answer.  But with any business model that sells BTC, if the price is skyrocketing and bitcoins are scarce, there's a chance that the transaction will be rejected. (Like we've seen with coinbase)
I use bitinstant to transfer USD *into* MtGox, then I buy the bitcoins myself.  This method does not rely on bitinstant having a reserve of BTC available for purchase.  It also gives me a bit more control over precisely when and how much BTC I want (due to market swings)

Step 1.) Bitcoin users migrate en-mass to a tiny UN -recognized country.  I would personally choose a tropical one.
Step 2.) BTC is quickly promoted, and services are set up that accept BTC
Step 3.) The widespread adoption of BTC becomes so universal, that government officials promote it as the official currency.
Step 4.) Once established as the Official currency for X, world governments will have a harder time ridding the world of bitcoin, or banning it outright.

Other sites have more or less liquidity.  If a big holder decides to panic and sell BTC on a site with low volume, it will drive the price down tremendously.

Well, yes and no.  On a short term scale this is very true - sure bids and asks will ebb and flow over time.  On a given moment it can be difficult to see the true nature of the market if there are many dark orders.
But the long term picture here can paint a more accurate image of how much relative BTC and USD is present on the exchange floor.

One feature I have always been pushing for is "locked withdrawals"
I only ever want my BTC coming out of an exchange to arrive in a wallet I control.  So I want to tell the exchange what that address is, and have them lock it so that BTC cannot be withdrawn to any other address without first being sent to the one address I specify.  The exchange *could* change this address, but not without significant due process and notification. 
Another option is to add a mandatory time delay to withdrawals.  I want the option to specify a period of time that must pass before a withdrawal is confirmed, with the option to cancel at any time.

They're basically a competitor to Bitinstant.  They allow you to make a cash deposit and will send the BTC into your account within hours (usually sooner)  No complaints the two times I used them in the past.
I will caution other people though, while this is one of the quickest it is not necessarily the cheapest way to get BTC.  The exchange price is 5.99% over the current market rate.  It's usually only a good idea to buy BTC direct like this if the market is trending up.

Currently no, 
I've heard of some companies potentially implementing it though.  I think that it could be feasible if the company that's selling you bitcoins has enough of your personal information verified so that they could go after users who do the chargeback.  It's a shame that this reason alone is the biggest hurdle to get BTC via credit card.  I can bet there are plenty of honest users who would try to play by the rules.
@_date: 2013-01-24 21:59:49
People have always been willing to commit a certain amount of investment to bitcoin mining, but what's changing over time is the hashpower return on their monetary investment.  Let's look at the facts: 
Right now at  you can see that the most cost effective mining set ups using graphics cards or FPGA's will get you a return of hashing power in the range of 1.6-1.8 Mhash/s/$.  
**In other words** if I'm willing to spend $1,300 on a mining rig today, I'll expect to be getting around 2,210 Mhas/s in power out of it.  That's the current market, and you can [see for yourself]( what the network hashpower looks like because of it.  
Now, when ASICs start becoming *mainstream* and most miners have plugged them in, that's when the game has changed. The Jalapeno has a 30.2 Mhas/s/$ ratio and Their better models are pushing 46-50.  In other words, the people that will be seriously investing in mining and putting down the most capital to try to get the most hashing power will be grabbing about 48 Mhas/s/$ 
Let's compare the two rates roughly, 48/1.7= 28.2x higher power for the money, meaning the Network difficulty once Asics become mainstream will be *at least* 28.2x higher than it is now.  Not accounting for the fact that current profitable miners will likely try to invest more, and new profiteers on the scene will also likely try to get on the game.  So with about 28x as a base, how much higher will the network get a year from now? 40x? 60x? 100x? It's tough to say, but take 28x as the best case scenario.  
**Even if I bought myself a 60 GH/s Single SC** and managed to get it delivered to my house, I would expect to only be pulling around 0.39 BTC per day.  What you can only hope is that the actual value of the bitcoin will climb over time.  Even at $30 USD for 1 BTC, that's looking like a paltry payout. The real winners in this scenario will be the lucky sons of guns who manage to get their preorders first.  
[Even Butterfly labs has a sticky about the profitability of their devices.](
**What's easy to forget** is that members of the public are not the only people interested in ASIC mining.  [Russian private entrepreneurs]( (and no doubt people from many other nationalities) are interested in making and acquiring chips for the sole purpose of mining for themselves.  We only tend to talk about Butterfly Labs, Avalon, and ~~bASIC~~ because they're selling to the public.

this site has a number of useful statistics
@_date: 2013-02-20 06:04:38
Forget the USD to bread analogy for a moment.  Bitcoin is a scarce commodity.  It's being created at an exponentially decreasing rate that will taper off to zero around the year 2040.  
This means that its price is pretty much entirely determined by demand, and in the future there won't be a sudden devaluation of the bitcoin due to more being made.  
That being said, the price of BTC can definitely go down if people either lose confidence or want to "cash out" of BTC if they're using it as an investment tool.  But since this is the early phase, there are many of the opinion that bitcoin's value will grow by leaps and bounds before equalizing.   What is this ultimate equlibrium?  It is essentially reached when the number of people willing to invest and put money into bitcoin is closely similar to the number of people willing to exchange btc for their home fiat currency. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:29:14

So in a moment of impulsive madness you created a new password phrase?  
Okay, stop thinking, just right now, go back to the exact same situation you were in trying to make up that new password.  Try thinking the same thoughts you were having before.  Write down a new password.  Doesn't matter if it's correct.  Just make a new phrase.  Then make another, and another, do this several times until you've run out of creativity.
Then take the list of all the password phrases you've created and examine them.  Any common themes?  Does one look more correct than the others?  Go ahead and try a few out, try different permutations.  You are the one that created the password.  There is always the chance your own brain will cough it up again given the right circumstances
Then just take a break.  Your brain's ability to recall memory is different under stress versus when it's relaxed.  Just go chill, you've made the list, you can always go back to it.  Don't stress just go back to it when you're in a peaceful state of mind and examine it again very observantly.  You might see something that jumps out at you.

A question so old I wish we could sticky it to the top of this subreddit.
Producing these kind of miners is not a trivial or inexpensive process, it requires hefty startup capital that needs to be paid back.  These sellers (BFL and Avalon) will mine with some of their equipment, but overall they will also want to recoup their costs quickly by selling them to customers. 
Some less known companies like ASICminer kept most of the equipment themselves and simply sold shares to recoup their costs in a different business model.  But the reality is a company *can* try to mine with their own equipment, but the ROI isn't nearly as stable as "sell now, build more, mine later"
@_date: 2013-03-03 21:39:34


The author of the article doesn't really understand that the rate at which bitcoins are minted is continuously adjusted based on hashing power.  
I *can* tell you that new bitcoins will temporarily leave the hands of the masses and start to migrate towards the hands of the few.  There will simply be few ASIC miners at first, and many GPUs will be forced offline to do sheer unprofitability. It is my hope that eventually more ASICs will arrive to the market and the average joe willing to drop a couple hundred bucks on mining hardware will recieve his due.

MtGox has been mostly up but intermittently down for me over the past hour or so.  When you check sites like  you can see the downtime as punctuated by prolonged flat lines.  
Last I checked my coins I had no open orders and nothing looked out of the ordinary.  If downtime becomes a prolonged issue, one place to check for updates is the MtGox twitter feed 
At this point though, I'm not really worried about it.  These kinds of things have unfortunately become part of the norm.

It means that there is a lot of pressure to buy since BTC is artificially scarce.  We've seen drops of great magnitude in the past few weeks, ($2-6) and they bounce right back up.  Because people are betting that the price will one day be much higher than $30.  I'm inclined to agree.
I take it as good sign that the wall crumbled and so many sell orders were satisfied, it means the people that want out, got out. And now we can get back to buying.  How long will this last?  That's anyone's guess.

@_date: 2013-12-07 08:23:35
This one feels distinctly different from the April Crash of last year.  Back then there was a legitimate concern that bitcoin in general was not only unstable, but dangerous to hold on to and difficult to convert. 
Many exchanges had an awful time handling an exploding userbase, experienced DDOS attacks or outright hacks, but the bitcoin protocol itself was still legitimately useful and had never changed.  
The last crash was largely driven by a sudden complete uptick in the amount of coins available for sale.  The rise in price had been a long time coming and there was an absolute glut of bitcoin dumping on the market.  (Over 150,000 BTC total became available to sell) 
This time it's mostly caused by a retraction of bid support underneath the price.  Translation?  The price will face little resistance if it decides to snap back up again. 
@_date: 2013-02-23 05:27:32

The $30 ask wall was legit because it was so longstanding.  But a common tactic I've seen this evening is for someone with a large account to dump hundreds of BTC and then immediately pop up a 600-800 BTC ask wall as low as one possibly can.  It's been effective at getting the ball rolling.  
Whoever is doing this wants the price down over the weekend so they can buy by the time their acct clears monday.  I doubt they anticipated it would crash this much.

Go to a site like bitspend.com and buy everything you wanted to buy anyway using bitcoins.  No currency conversion required.  Assuming you actually wanted to withdraw that amount though, it's time to do a bank transfer.  Set aside about 40% for capital gains taxes next year (if you're a US citizen)

If your point is to clog the network with spam transactions, I'm not sure you can anymore 


In other words you can still send 0.00000001 satoshi, but you'll need to run your own miners with modified rules to get those transactions included in the blockchain. 
Another reason this doesn't happen is that it would be ridiculously expensive.  
**To actually answer your first question** about trying to spam the blockchain with many small transactions and making it unfeasibly large to download for new users, this topic is debated constantly in the "development and technical discussion" section of the bitcoin forums.  
Here is one such idea if you're interested in reading into it:
**As for question 2** try here: 
@_date: 2013-02-28 17:49:42
A large amount of "ask" or "bid" orders that have built up at a particular price point.  For instance, if people have decided that they are willing to sell a ton of bitcoins $38.5, then these orders must be satisfied before the price can climb higher.  This is sometimes referred to as resistance.
If a ton of people decide that they are willing to buy at $32, then the price cannot go lower before first satisfying these orders.  This is called support. 
People have all kinds of methodologies with regards to buy and selling around walls.  But in general, if a wall falls, the price will often quickly move past it.
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:52:34
I've had generally favorable dealings with Bitinstant.  I think the key difference here is:  Did you use a cash deposit for MtGox USD or did you buy bitcoins?  
If you were buying bitcoins, they're ridiculously scarce right now, I imagine many companies are having difficulty keeping them in stock. 
If you bought MtGox USD, that *should* go through pretty immediately, because all they have to do is take their fees and send it to MtGox.  I'd keep trying to get in touch with their customer support via email.

MtGox is alright, and you don't need to get verified to trade.  However, getting verified definitely makes it easier/faster to transfer money. Dwolla is one of the quickest/cheapest ways to move funds from your bank into MtGox.  
I would normally recommend Ziggap but they've been "down for maintenance" for days.
Bitinstant can be one of the quickest ways to get BTC via a cash deposit, but you'll pay a small premium over the current market rate.

In my opinion the one of the best ways to protect against chargebacks is to make it an invested process.  Have users sign up for a significant (even one time) membership fee, then warn them that abuse can result in their membership being cancelled.  Then give them fantastic rates.  It really boost the number of users willing to use the service responsibly vs. those who want to defraud it, even more so if you take down personal info.

No fancy sign ups needed. Someone could simply purchase a floating $X amount of bitcoin and redeem it later anytime to their own wallet. 
Merchants could enforce rules such as "paid with cash only" to avoid chargebacks when they're selling these.

You want bitcoins right? Sure, many do!  But consider for a moment what you're willing to pay for a bitcoin. 
$5?  -Oh heck yes
$10? - Sure!
$20? - I think so
$40? Um...yea, 
$50? er wait...
$80? Probably no
$160?  No...
Your willingness to buy bitcoins at a certain price is based in part upon what you think the projected value will be in the near future.  Yes, you can be sure I want bitcoins too.  Many here do. Demand might drive them into the hundreds or thousands someday, but the market has bought them up so quickly that people are beginning to take profit (i.e. sell their bitcoins in droves)
You want a bitcoin, but assuming you have any gift of foresight, you also want to make sure that you paid the right price for that bitcoin.
Right now, the market is most definitely trending down.  You can buy if you want, but the price is likely to drop even further.  Bitcoin just dropped from $49 to 45 within a few hours.
Care to wait? Or do you still want your bitcoins right now?

This is a complex question.  I agree that more distribution needs to happen, but it's also possible that many coins are "lost."  I'd try to make this kind of analysis while factoring out any coins that haven't moved in 2+ years.  That's a lot of time spent to grow stale. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:45:52
Good points.  It could quickly become a lot of work if it's not well thought out.  
I figure since they also moderate bitcointalk and other forums, they likely already know the developers/key community members and there won't be too many accounts for this.
A bot or automated service can award badges for most other fame/or infamy. But the community should decide whether or not this is a good idea, since it will make some users more likely to be upvoted and others to be downvoted.  
The intent is basically to help people know who is reputable.

Technically accepting payment outside of ebay is against their TOS, but in reality it happens all the time.  Some users will even contact the seller and ask if they offer BTC.  
In my experience, if you are a buyer it's best to avoid offering BTC unless you absolutely trust the seller.  If you are a seller and you accept BTC without delivering the product, the customer will likely file a complaint and ebay can come after you.  
Just make sure that whatever you're doing is fair

[This is perhaps the most interesting chart on Blockchain.info]
( 
It details the Trade vs. Transaction volume for Bitcoin over time.  Drilling down into it, I'll explain why it's important. 
The idea was proposed by [Blogger David Perry]( following the 2011 speculation bubble.  He wanted an easy way to see whether bitcoin's economy was truly growing, or if investors were simply ratcheting up the price through trades.  
The ratio describes how much money is being traded around on the exchanges vs. how much is being sent around the blockchain.  These numbers need to be taken with a grain of salt, because speculators move money too, but in general:
* When the ratio is high, there is more money being traded at the exchanges.
* When the ratio is low, there is more money being moved around the BTC economy relative to the amount being traded at exchanges.  
* Dramatic spikes can appear when there is a sell-off or buy-in at the exchanges.
* Flatter areas mean that the economy is keeping pace with the trades. 
So what does all this mean?  Looking at the chart we can see a couple interesting patterns.  
* In the early days of bitcoin Circa 2010, the price was astonishingly low and thus the ratio was all over the place.  A person dropping $100 or $1000 into the exchanges could dramatically change the ratio.  This area is effectively noise.
* The first big spike came in 2011 with the biggest panic sell.   At the time bitcoin was definitely experiencing a speculative bubble, and the exchange transactions far exceeded any activity on the network. 
* In late 2011 we see another interesting spike as the price drops down to near $2.5 levels.  Once again small trades had a huge impact on the ratio.
* But most interestingly, the ratio stays far below previously seen after January of 2012.  Speculation begins to increase slowly throughout 2012 before tapering off, then again it increases for the September bubble sell-off, but from January 2013 onwards the ratio actually decreases.  
I'm really curious to know your thoughts on this.  We're all acutely aware of the recent price drop, but it appears that while trade volume on exchanges has increased immensely, the network transaction volume has as well, significantly!  So much so that it keeps the Trade/Transaction ratio low.  
What do you make of this?

There's no harm in being cautious!  When sending bitcoin around the worst that can happen is either getting the destination address wrong, or including a transaction fee that is way too high.  
Since Coinbase pays these transaction fees for you, you really can't mess that last part up.  Just make sure that you've got the correct address for the wallet you you want to send bitcoin to, and the network will take care of the rest.

Bitcoin is an elegant system that allows mutually antagonistic users to come together and agree on a history.  It cannot be forged.  Miners and users alike must abide by the rules of the original protocol or no one will accept their transactions.

I regret that my ebay score is not higher.  I rarely use ebay and only sold a few books back in my early college days.  I do have to protect the integrity of the transaction though.  I don't want details of it floating out there for my sake and for the buyer's sake.  If you feel that the details I've provided aren't sufficient, by all means pass me by, or just give me a call.  For pete's sake I listed my phone number on the ad.  
 &gt;while the truth is YOU would be making in the 1-10s of thousands a month right now if you actually had an Avalon
But the truth is I, as well as every other Batch  pre order am waiting for the item to be shipped. It's a risky situation.  When the Avalon finally does arrive in late april/early may could it make a ton of money?  Possibly.  Could it also fail? or Could bitcoin crash? Or could BFL finally ship and cause the difficulty to jump?  Sure.  It's a risky time.  I also simply do not have the time/effort to devote myself to cgminer right now. Sorry.  So I figure this Avalon is for someone else, and I am willing to put it in a bidding market so people can determine what it's worth.
Also, ebay buyer protection is a thing.  If for some reason I fail to deliver, the payment doesn't get released to me.  And also, the buyer will have all my personal info.  So rest assured, this kid is out to make a fair trade.

I would actually encourage you to NOT use this particular graph from MtGox.  Here are 3 other options that might be easier to understand, although be warned that all of them have their strengths and weaknesses. 
 
If you're new to Bitcoin and want to practice trading, I would also highly enourage you NOT to buy and sell on a daily, or even weekly basis.  Start by simply buying a some BTC and holding on to it, noticing the trends, and then make examples for yourself.  Like "what would happen if I sold it now?" or "what would happen if I bought more now?"
Nothing is guaranteed, but eventually you will develop some measure of confidence to begin executing those trades.  Remember not everyone is a day trader, that is a very time consuming (and potentially disastrous) way to make and lose money.  Long term trades can be very profitable, provided you have the patience and the insight to know when your investment has gone/is going bad.
@_date: 2013-04-28 13:08:16
Exactly this.  Pooled mining allows for more consistent payouts over time.  In the beginning it wasn't a big deal because solo-mining could score you a block every few minutes or hours, but as time when on the amount of variability you could experience begans to be intolerable.  Even the pools with all their hashpower can experience unlucky streaks.
Even with an Avalon ASIC you can currently expect to only find one block every week (at 66 GH/s power)

In theory that line of logic makes sense.  Mining isn't just about what you earn with the exchange rate now, it's about what you earn when you decide to sell or make purchases with bitcoin.  If you decide to sell your far in the future, where bitcoin could possibly be worth a lot more, then indeed mining may have been worth your time.  
But mining with graphics cards and severs really is going to be paying out a pittance.  I'm not sure whether you're talking about making 3.6 BTC per day or making 3.6 BTC across the total lifetime of your devices, but that's an impressive feat even by today's standards.  
You could spend $400 and have the 3.6 BTC today, or it would take about 6 Avalon miners at 60,000 GH/s each with 100% uptime to generate that much BTC in a day, and that payout is logarithmically decreasing all the time. It really is up to you.  It's never a bad idea to just try mining for the fun of it if you're not interested in the payouts, but I just hope you understand the risks mate.  There are a lot of other people with more experience pouring money into mining schemes, and even they may not break even.

This is just my 0.02 BTC, but the only utility I ever see to using physical coins or paper notes is cold storage for my own personal use. 
I would be really hesitant to accept physical BTC from someone else.  What if they wrote down the private key somewhere? You can "verify" the value all you want but when it comes time to merge the coins into a wallet they could be already spent. 
Even if the private key is sealed off, at one point in time it was exposed to the minter.  So you basically have to trust that whoever minted the paper BTC isn't a douche that's planning on ripping you off in the future.
**TL;DR** paper wallets make perfect sense for personal offline storage.  But they're terrible for spending (and seriously, who can make change?)

Admittedly, I first bought an Avalon because I had more confidence in their company than BFL.  
Mining was important to me because it helped secure the network, and the payout for an Avalon should be pretty ridiculous before it tapers off over time.  However, nowadays I'm not sure that I have the technical experience to use cgminer and run an Avalon.  
It was a pretty tough decision to sell it, because the person who buys it from me may very well end up making far more than they pay.  It depends on how the network difficulty and price of BTC changes over time.  So we'll see I suppose.
@_date: 2013-02-21 16:26:52
These questions can be difficult to answer because they are self-fulfilling prophecies.  If the community decides as a whole that today will be the day that the $30 wall falls, then they will buy BTC, hoping that the price increases, and indeed it will due to their collective actions.   
If they think a correction (price drop) is in order because there is less confidence in BTC that day, the community will generally sell, hoping to buy back when the price drops.
I myself will not see the $30 wall falling anytime soon until the price is grinding right up against it at the $29.9's.  It will likely take some time to move past this point, so you'll have a lot of warning.  
Personally if you ask me, I think we're in for a little correction here.

There are a couple reputable 3rd party sites like  that you can sell your bitcoins to.  But it's up to you to determine which method is the lowest cost.
Now I will say that dwolla is one of the easiest ways to transfer USD from MtGox directly into your bank account, and it currently costs $0.25 USD.
If you can't get dwolla verified (or don't want to) then you're probably going to have to do a bank transfer, OR go to localbitcoins.com and find someone nearby that is willing to pay you.

This is a very correct point to make.  The 2011 bubble was absolutely insane, more so than we saw back in April.  It also popped on its own, which is a little different from the MtGox precipitated DDoS attacks that precipitated the 2013 crash.  
The 2013 crash was caused by a mixture of fear and hype.  People were afraid of an impending crash due to the sudden rise, and afraid of the exchange being attacked and losing funds.  Now that the fear has dissipated and we're relying less on Gox, bitcoin is just continuing to do its thing. 
(Oh and btw, Bitcoin is scarcer than you think.  Now it's hard to buy AND hard to mine!)

Solo mining is the attempt to find a block entirely outside the help of a pool. 
Most pools are fairly straightforward, fair, and some are more user friendly than others.  
You may notice that some of them have the option to control the "difficulty" of the shares they are submitting.  This is essentially for much more powerful users to fine tune their own personal difficulty so they're not submitting too many shares at once and clogging the pool getwork (harder shares pay proportionally more) 
Really you should just enjoy the fine of mining while you can.  Unless you plan on investing with an ASIC in the future, they will quickly come to dominate the market.  Then you can either switch to litecoin or switch off

If we imagine an isolated system in which the only currency available truly is bitcoin, it's value would evolve as a function of the supply and demand of different commodities. 
Exchanges are essentially necessary for BTC because without them people would have a very hard time coming to a consensus over what the price should be on a given day.  The centralized exchanges make the whole bitcoin network more vulnerable however, so a truly ideal situation is to have a completely decentralized p2p exchange that can't be directly targeted or shut down.  Interestingly, the best candidate for this right now is ripple (which has its own problems, and is still in beta)  Buttercoin is also supposedly attempting an open-source p2p exchange, but this is a long time coming.

First thing that came to my mind: 
@_date: 2013-12-15 11:43:14
Couple options. 
1) Bip 0038 may save us all.  It's not just about protecting your wallet with a password, it's a type of password that can be very difficult to brute force thanks to Mike Caldwell's genius implementation to allow unicode characters.  That, and the fact that de-crypting a password protected private key takes slow scrypt processes, means that a simple 7-12 character password is effectively uncrackable.
You can create wallets that don't even know their private keys this way.  The mycelium app for instance can spend out of a Bip 0038 protected address doesn't need to store either the private key or the password on the device itself.  It will even returned partially spent funds to that same address.  The only big issue is a potential key-logger, which leads us to option 2.
2) Wallets that allow the owner to specify a mandatory delay on transactions before they're broadcast.  This can be done in a number of ways.  Much easier to do with a centralized service, but much harder (and better) to do with a trustless network.  I will be pushing for this idea as much as I can, because delayed spend transactions will allow bitcoin to be orders of magnitude more secure than it already is.  It is not a mechanism to do chargebacks, but it will *tell* you when you're being hacked, and failsafe options can be built into it.

You can get USD into MtGox very easily with Bitinstant.  The main limits are $500 per transaction.  The fees are modest which amount to 3.99% of your deposit + a $3.95 zipzap fee.  
But the main advantage is that once you have USD in MtGox, you can execute a trade at your leisure, either all at once or in pieces.  Transferring BTC out of MtGox is trivial after that
Also you can try to buy BTC directly with Ziggap, very quick, they too use cash deposits.

Yesterday's volume was the third highest of all time.  The rise was a continuance of the market's failure to breach the $50 bid walls.  When this momentum stopped, many realized that it was a great time to buy back in. 
The price was dipping into the upper 60s but popped back up into the 70s once someone built a 12-15k buy wall at 70. In my opinion this is transient and should be viewed cautiously, but it also means that someone is sitting on about a million USD waiting to buy back in. 
Dips and peaks as we jostle around the 78-70 range.  (Provided these walls hold)  But if we breach either of these prices, hold on to your butts because it's going to move farther past (up or down).

It's sad that BFL has not been honest and straightforward about their delivery process.  While I believe they will deliver a product, it will ultimately be an inferior product compared to what customers should have received.  
Avalon started up, designed a better ASIC, and delivered it in the time it took for BFL to just take preorder money.  The truth is there is absolutely *no* justification for BFL promising deliveries back in 2012.
KNCminer is looking like a legitimate company (site: 
Partly because they're taking paypal as a payment method.  I would highly encourage this route.  Scammers don't like to take paypal because doing so requires them to submit all kinds of proof-of-identiy and proof-of-business documents, and if they fail to deliver a product the account gets frozen and the customer gets refunded
I will caution people though, KNCminer has not made a working product yet.  Reserve your investment until they do

I think for the layperson the greatest appeal that bitcoin has is its potential as an investment tool.  They'll be putting their money into something that won't subject to rampant inflation.  
But one can't think about BTC as an investment forever.  This is just the early phase and with widespread adoption the exchange price is moving closer to equilibrium.
Laypeople won't be the immediate adopters though.  The real people who can take advantage of BTC is the merchants.  They get paid for their transaction instantaneously.  There is a much lower risk of fraud.  It's going to be up to them to accept bitcoin and provide incentives for doing so.

I've been charged $3.95 for using ZIP-ZAP (location USA)  This is on top of the 3.99% fee that Bitinstant usually charges.
Because of this, I usually use Ziggap to buy bitcoins.  Not only do they have a higher transaction cap ($750 per transaction) they typically only charge about 3.2% above market rates. The math works out to be cheaper.
Yet each has their purpose.  If you think the market is trending down, I would recommend buying through bitinstant.

The yellow line is an ask order, it existed for a short time there because a person (or more likely, group of persons) were willing to pay a very large amount of money for bitcoins in the $32.2-$32.6 range.
This wall disappeared shortly thereafter because whoever put it up realized they could probably buy bitcoins at a lower price, or just execute a market order.  
You might be realizing how silly it looks because it means that tons of people are suddenly willing to pay more than what the market price *just was* moments ago.  This is because so many people have realized that the price is about to go up, and it leads to a panic buy.

Sorry you're a little late to that party. 
 
118 kilohashes per second is equivalent to about 0.118 megahashes.
Type in 0.118 to the hash rate box of the [bitcoin mining calculator]( and you'll see that you're expected to make about 1 penny per month.  
These days you cannot really mine profitably with a CPU, GPU, and you'll be hard pressed to mine profitably with a FPGA.  The latest generation of mining technology uses ASIC, so you'll have to get your hands on that if you want to create bitcoins yourself in any substantial quantity.  Keep in mind though, that mining is not for everyone.  It takes a reasonable investment to get started, a plethora of things can go wrong, and there are associated power costs with running a miner.  If you have a decent graphics card, you can try mining with that for fun just to see a couple cents pile up here and there, but beyond that you're better off purchasing a few BTC for yourself and letting them sit over time.

I believe it's kind of a reciprocal relationship, where each result can be a cause of the other.
* Increasing difficulty can lead to increasing prices as would-be miners simply buy bitcoin instead
* Increasing prices can lead to increasing difficulty as would-be buyers decide it's profitable enough to mine
* Decreasing difficulty can lead to decreased prices if would-be buyers decide to invest in mining equipment instead.  
* Decreasing prices can lead to decreased difficulty as miners drop out when they don't meet margins
I'll definitely agree that correlation does not imply causation, but I think the relationship between price and difficulty is more complex than we'd think.  A couple good charts for it are plotted out at

In a perfect world, I would be able to convert all of my income to bitcoin and then buy my essentials (rent, food, gas, etc) but indeed there is an incentive to save.  In reality though, you're always going to be somewhat of a consumer.  
I understand that you don't want to spend your bitcoin because it's rising.  But if you really think it will go up why not convert all your savings to bitcoin and never spend it at all?  
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:52:44
The simplest argument against a deflating currency is that it discourages some spending. This is absolutely true. But only up to a point.  We know very well that people are comfortable buying things today that they can get cheaper in the near future. Computers for instance, can be noticeably outdated in a few months after you buy them.  And yet they are still bought/sold all the time.  
Furthermore, some kinds of essential needs simply do not go away.  However reluctant someone is to spend a deflating currency, there will always be a need to spend *some* of it to meet those basic requirements of life.  
The degree to which the currency deflates is also important, as well as the expectations of the holders.  
Ultimately though, BTC will not be deflating forever.  It's value will be inherently tied to the economy/demand for savings, which may wax and wane over time. If people perceive the value of BTC to be falling, it may be a good time to spend it.  We shall see how this plays out.  
In its early days, the BTC is VERY volatile, but osme have suggested that as it increases in price it will be harder and hard to manipulate.  
One thing that absolutely MUST happen going forward in the future is that the big "holders" have to cash out.  So I honestly don't panic when I see a big selling getting out of the market.  BTC needs to be more distributed among the people who want it, and as time goes on that reality will only increase.

Hey bitcoin_throw1, I remember you were voicing some similar frustrations in that thread like Supradealz.  One of the things you did mention earlier is that your account was a few days away from being past the 30 day verification window.  Since a transaction rejection is likely due to a program (and not a person) the system might treat you differently once you've got through all of the verification steps. 
Coinbase is still working the kinks out of their fraud detection system, so its unfortunate that this occasionally still happens to the good guys.  It seems like they're constantly improving the security check however, because they're doing much better as the year goes on.

I find the [bitcoin]( market a little unique, with a couple key facts to consider:
1.) There was a previous $30 peak, and then crash.  This is actually a good thing.  It makes people more risk averse, and it also defuses some of the bubble tension that can build when people start thinking "Omg this is the highest price ever!"  It becomes a little easier to accept the idea of a $30 bitcoin if the price has already been there.
2.) Every day, approximately 3600 Bitcoins are being mined by the community at current block payout rates (25 BTC per block) this is one of the primary pressures that decreases the value of the bitcoin.  But importantly, it continues at a very stable rate.  This means that there is not likely to be a sudden explosive deflation of the value of bitcoins from simply too many entering the market.
3.) One of the biggest factors that helps increase the value of bitcoins is the [market capitalization]( You can view a graph of it at this link.  It represents the total value that all the bitcoins in the world represent (how much money is being traded in their name)   To give you an idea, the current market capitalization is 191,212,127.  The current number of bitcoins in circulation is 10,700,175.  The former divided by the latter is 17.86, which is very close to the actual price of the current bitcoin per dollar.  The more people that wish to convert money into bitcoins, the higher the price that BTC will get. 
**Above all** I personally choose to invest in BTC because I believe the market capitalization will grow to be much higher than the mere 191 million that it is now. There will be people who choose to "cash out" and exchange their BTC for USD or the like, and that is fine.  But sooner or later I believe they will come back, and the idea itself will grow among people who are currently unaware.  The time is ripe.

In my view I see security as one of the top problems facing bitcoin.  Each sum at an address has a simple private key associated with it.  If the private key is known by an attacker it allows the bitcoin to be stolen instantly, regardless of whatever security measures a person might be taking.  So currently, all of our efforts have focused on hiding/obscuring the private key. 
But I want to go deeper than that.  I want to make it so that even if a thief burrows into my system and finds my private keys, he's still able to be thwarted.  This can be done by giving users control over how their coins will behave.  Bitcoin has these controls somewhat built in by things called output scripts.  
These days output scripts are very simple.  When you "send" coins to someone you're actually just defining an amount of bitcoin that can only be forwarded if someone can complete an ECDSA signature using the private key of an address.  Our wallets know the private keys, so in our minds receiving and sending bitcoin is a trivial afterthought.
But I want users to have the option to introduce more useful arguments into their output scripts.  What I'm effectively driving at is the ability for us to introduce mandatory delays before the coins actually leave our wallets.  These delays are permanently set up when the coins are first transferred.  No amount of hacking or malware could actually change it because literally everyone in the network would agree there is an X amount of delay on your coins before they can move.  A failsafe address to a paper wallet can also be included in case you yourself need to move the coins *now.*   
But what this amounts to is a system where thieves cannot instantly steal your BTC.  If they ever try to you will know about it right away and will have the option to change the destination, resetting the delay period again.  They can literally only wait to send your BTC, or send it to your paper wallet.  Users may opt to set up a whole chain of failsafe addresses.  It's a smarter way to think of how our coins can be accessed even by someone with malicious intentions.  It would prevent the instant theft of BTC as well as the instant loss of money from accidental user-error.
Now, technically these ideas are compatible with bitcoin itself, but introducing them would likely meet so much resistance that it would warrant making another alt-currency (perhaps called Vaultcoin)

I second this.  Brute forcing the private key from a known public one is near impossible, but if you have access to the machine you could try to run a password cracker against your wallet client itself.  The time it takes to solve is mostly a matter of your password's length.

I would definitely like to see that happen, but interestingly you need to establish the value of the currency somewhere, and relating it to fiat is always going to be relevant.  Merchants and consumers will begin to embrace bitcoin when its value continues to grow and plateau in the long run.  The more diversified the exchanges get, the better.

This is honestly a grand idea, but it underscores how complex it is for a newbie to accept bitcoin.  I wish there were an incredibly streamlined process for importing paper BTC like this.  It should be as simple as...
1.) downloading an app on a phone, (or computer)
2.) touching a button that says: "Import BTC"
3.) taking a picture (or at worst, entering the numbers) 
And presto: btc in the wallet.  Also major props to PartTimeLegend below for the idea of keeping a copy of the private key yourself and sweeping some weeks later to collect un-redeemed BTC.  Or not, then it's technically just a gift to everyone.

How unlikely is it?  Well, it depends.
First head on over to a profitability calculator like this one:  
The only input field you should really care about is the one that says "hashrate" I used to have a GPU miner that could output 90 mhas/s for instance.  So I'll input 90 in the megahashes field.
(note, a crappy computer will be doing CPU mining in terms of kilohashes or worse)
But at 90 MH/s, at the current difficulty, it would take my computer somewhere around 11 years 223 days to solve 1 block on average.  The actual time might vary greatly, it could be more or less depending on my luck.  These are pretty terrible odds for a 25 btc payoff, not to mention that the block reward will have at least 2-3 more times within that time frame, and the network difficulty should spike by many orders of magnitude. 
But the short answer is yes, you could in theory just get super lucky.

The only people with credible info on the matter would be Gox insiders.  They have been surprisingly mum on the issue.   
Beyond that is pure speculation, which you should take with a satoshi of salt.  At best, Gox will continue to fumble around for months before it sets up equitable banking partners.  The take away message if this happens is that their exchange will be absolutely destroyed by volatility and scarcity issues, and it might cause some real confusion/damage in the bitcoin economy 
Gox could also sort their mess out relatively quickly, in which case their inflated exchange rate would immediately plummet as folks try to transfer BTC there and cash it out for a profit. 
Gox has EVERY incentive to get things resolved quickly, but the fact that this has been going on all summer means that something is seriously wrong.

While it's not a ponzi scheme, bitcoin is subject to deflationary price spikes .  You can think of this as the exact opposite of what happened with zimbabwe's inflationary price drops (their money lost purchasing power dramatically)

Ah sorry, Long story short?  There wasn't enough USD in the market yet to offset pressure to sell, people were still looking to get out after the crash. This pressure escalated and reached a critical point around $50.  There was so much resistance (people willing to buy) here that the price could not go lower, and realizing this the market immediately bought back up.  
Where is it going from here? It's anyone's guess.  It's much easier to analyze what *has* happened from what's going to happen.  But every sell-off has a floor.

I think you bring up the some great points, but I see solvency as the crux of the issue.  If they are solvent but are just faced with banking withdrawal delays, then I have no problem leaving open bid orders there.

Coinbase and MtGox serve entirely different purposes, although some of their functions may be redundant.
MtGox is currently the highest volume exchange market for converting BTC to USD and back.  If you can get USD into MtGox through its various inlets, it has the lowest possible fees and quickest transaction times.  
Coinbase is used primarily as a online wallet, but they too let you purchase coins (with significant delays and minimal fees)

Unless you took out a loan in BTC (something which I would never, ever recommend) deflation isn't a problem.  The price will rise and fall as investors buy up and sell off, but the hard limit ensures that BTC's value will be primarily derived from demand.

Oh cool, I can explain this because I actually saw it happen. 
As I was sitting the past few days watching the market (I had some free time) I noticed that traders were having a heyday with the Zero-fee transactions while they were in place.  The price swung up and down wildly.  
By and large, a lot of people had cashed out of the market so there was a glut of extra cash, but it's a lot easier to transfer BTC into MtGox than it is to transfer fiat in.  So as the price is swinging up and down with the speculation, it slowly starts dipping lower and lower and lower.  The trend going on here is that people are deciding to sit it out or cash out entirely, meanwhile there's not enough influx of cash to keep any upward momentum going.  The price starts to trend downward with increasing velocity. 
I flipped my investments to the fiat side and watched it fall for a bit, it was jaw dropping.  Support levels (legtimiately huge bid walls of 1000-3000 BTC or more) in the 80s, 70s, 60s, and the upper 50s fell like dominoes.  The market was collectively cashing out in the psychological fever that if they sell now, the price will go lower to buy back later.  Either that or "sell now to preserve my gains and get out."
But as more and more people sold, the amount of cash sitting on MtGox continued to pile up.  Suddenly Bitcoins were in a huge surplus compared to demand.  There was an agonizing minute or so as people sold absolutely enormous orders against the last few bid walls at 50, but these walls were bigger, at least 7k worth.  As the price goes lower, there is an exponentially increasing amount of resistance.  i put my bid in at 50.1 and watched the sellers flail against the wall.  Seconds ticked by, no one was really sure what it would do for a moment (any more and the market would absolutely bottom out down into the 40s and 30s)  
But the walls held firm.  And when people realized there weren't enough sell orders to move the price any lower than 50, they bought back hard.  The price shot back up into the 60s within minutes and has continued to bounce around in the 60-80 range.  
The market may decide to test the 50 floor again, but at the time of this writing it's been built back up to about 75k BTC worth of bids.  The crash of April 9th was driven largely by lag and panic selling, while the second crash of April 15th was driven by expectation and an inability of bank deposits to clear quickly enough. 
Are some beginning to buy back into the market now that it's low and their deposits are clearing? Yup.

In my experience now is where the waters will begin to get choppy. 
There is no longer the assurance that the BTC has once had a higher price.  As the BTC ventures into new territory the market will really have some weird movements.  You'll see lots of walls at certain integers like 40, 50, etc.  There will be upswings and downswings, but I can tell you this, I am now, more than ever, really hesitant to sell my BTC.  If the price drops I will definitely buy, but I don't want to be stuck in a bear trap.

I honestly can't answer that for you.  There's a lot of uncertainty in the short term.  There are panic sellers who want to cash out as quickly as possible at any price, speculators who still want to game the ups and downs, big money that sold in the upper 200s and want to scoop up as many as possible down low, and others who have no idea what they're doing.  All that translates into a lot of short term volatility.

~~Just so we're clear: how big was the transaction and how much of a fee did you send?~~ 
**30 BTC, holy shit**
If your transaction gets picked up by one of the big pools, it's  remotely possible they may send some of it back if you contact the pool managers and ask very, very nicely.  (extremely remote, but possible).  If it gets picked up by a solo miner which is less likely that fee is pretty much gone.  But if this is a big enough issue, escalating public attention can only help.

Now is simply not a good time for the average, uneducated user to get into mining, and unfortunately it might be like that for quite a while.
Bitcoin mining recently underwent a technological shift.  Where before an enthusiast could go out and purchase a couple high end graphics cards or FPGA units and turn out a nice little pile of BTC, ASICs have come to dominate the competition.  The fact that they are ultra-custom chips and hard to come by makes them very overpriced.  The only way you could possibly get them for a more reasonable price is to have taken a gamble months ago to bid on the tech while it was still in development. 
If you try to buy mining equipment in this very moment, you're likely paying too much for a machine with a limited lifespan that will not meet its return on investment.  That is to say, you would end up with more BTC than if you just took your capital and bought coins outright. 
The real people making money off of mining are focused companies with business connections and their own assembly processes for aggregating these chips.  Mining has always been a competition, and apart from the first few years mining has always been destined to move towards centralization.  If it were that easy, everyone would be doing it and the venture would quickly become unprofitable.  
Remember that everyone is still competing over the generation of roughly 3600 BTC per day.  You are always free to do what you want with your own money, but I would suggest investing in bitcoins or bitcoin service companies rather than mining itself.  
Oh and also, stay away from Butterfly labs.

I honestly am not familiar with which program ASICminer Erupters need to work off of.  Typically everyone says CGminer because it is the most basic.  My initial guess is no, 50miner will not work because it was designed for graphics cards, but the team at 50btc might have updated the program since then to work with ASICs

I would never recommend selling BTC for a credit card because people use the chargeback feature and there is no recourse.
However, since you sent the BTC you can sign the transaction yourself.  If you are unfamiliar with how to do this, we can help.  Signing a transaction literally means attaching a message to it.  So perhaps you can say something to the effect of "my-ebay-ID sent at date-time such and such to ebay user xyz" and if it is indeed 4 bitcoins you might be able to show that to paypal to bolster your case.

If you're going to invest in the BTC architecture, there are a few much-needed projects that will help get the ball on this rolling.
1.) An easy way to purchase BTC. Maybe even via credit card.  Sadly this is still not possible today and represents a major barrier to the general public holding coins.
2.) An escrow service, this is quite possibly the most difficult service to implement because it requires people to settle disputes over potentially fraudulent transactions
3.) More secure wallets, offline, but especially online. Making bitcoins harder to steal is essential to the integrity of the network going forward.
4.) An easy, and secure way to move coins into cold storage, most users have no idea how to do this properly and many risk losing coins doing so.
5.) A seamlessly integrated payment service that allows new users to accept BTC in seconds.  **Seconds.**

Nah, put very simply the central bank would charge banks for holding their money.  They think it would make banks more likely to loan out money rather than hold it.

I think what he's trying to say is that it's difficult to imagine an immediate successor to the application specific integrated chip.  Something superior would likely involve a leap in chip and computing technology that we're not currently familiar with.  What's more likely is that ASIC chips themselves will be further optimized for hash power and energy consumption.  It will be unlikely that we'll see a new emerging market that simply overtakes ASIC, especially within the year.

I may be misunderstanding this, but if you use the good 'ol bitcoin-qt to store BTC right on your computer, the wallet.dat file is automatically encrypted and locked.  Most functions require using your password to change anything. 
In the bottom right hand corner of the program there is an icon that looks like a lock, and if you hover over it, text will appear saying "wallet is **encrypted** and currently **locked.**

To execute an apparent "double spend" you'll basically have to simultaneously broadcast two transactions.  (not a trivial thing to do)  
One transaction has a low or no fee associated with it, this is the payment you're sending out that you want to fail.  
The other transaction has a higher fee associated with it, this is sent to an address you control.
The reason for doing this is that it momentarily creates a situation where coins have apparently been spent to two places at once (but not yet confirmed)  The danger is in accepting an unconfirmed transaction.  
Since there's no such thing as a true duplication of coins, the network will eventually come to a consensus on which of the two transactions is included in a block (usually the one with higher fees) 
@_date: 2013-09-25 05:54:26

With **CampBX** you can use dwolla, which in my experience is very fast and inexpensive (takes a day or two). I believe another user posted a referral link below if you want to take advantage of that. The downside is that CampBX is relatively small and new, so there's lower liquidity if you're selling/buying a ton of BTC.
**Coinbase** acts as a nifty liaison and you can buy BTC there directly with your bank account and send USD directly back in.  This is assuming you don't mind having your bank account linked, but as a legit business I trust them.
**MtGox** is still actually processing withdrawals, but has really walked into a legal minefield, and with uncooperative banks they have been limited to 10 SWIFT withdrawals per day, it's really quite unbelievable.  
**Bitstamp** is the likely 2nd choice to process withdrawals and they have a decent track record, but they are based in Slovenia. Do your homework before trusting anyone with a large amount of funds.  
**Localbitcoins.com** is also potentially useful if there are folks in your immediate area willing to trade.  Make sure to use the escrow.

Bitcoins value will increase dramatically with each subsequent reward halving.  The cycle will progressively produce less bitcoin over time, making it ultra-scarce in the next few decades.  We may look back and fondly sigh at the time when you could even buy a single bitcoin for $1,000
Another aspect to consider is that there will be times when bitcoin maxes out the adoption rate and current implementations find no extra use.  In the years to come, this will undoubtedly taper off.  It will also be harder to manipulate the price as BTC becomes even more distributed

There are definitely alternatives. [Ziggap.com] ( is a fairly reputable BTC seller.  I've used them on several occasions without issue.  If you use a cash deposit at a local bank or Western Union, they're able to send BTC to a specified address within minutes, usually less than an hour.  Fees are modest, and in an up-trending market buying with Ziggap can be useful.
Some people tend to use coinbase because of their low fees and delayed pricing.  I tend not to use them, it's too limiting. 
Another option to consider in the future is coin*lab*, which will allow for much higher volume trades in the US, but their fees remain to be seen.

You talk about security. 
I want a wallet that can reliably enforce user determined delays on broadcasting a transaction, and send the coins elsewhere with a failsafe if needed (before they are sent out).  Why?  
Even with password access, a thief or virus would still have to suffer the same waiting time upon spending coins.  The owner would have time to react and direct the potentially stolen funds elsewhere. 
This is not a way to chargeback or forge payment, this is a way to delay spends before they happen. 
It would:
* Create one of the safest known hot-wallets, able to give users time to react (and actually intervene) when their funds are being stolen
* Receive the 5 BTC bounty that I've posted for this purpose.

I was paying unusual attention to Mt.Gox live all day yesterday and This morning.  [  The market was consistently bumping up against resistance around 18.30 (shown by the blue line) but as more and more people bought, the tall blue line (representing ask prices) just kept shrinking and shrinking down.  After the plateau eroded I realized there was no resistance left to prevent the price from moving up.  So I bought heavy and I'm pretty satisfied with the result. 
**TL;DR** It's a bad idea to buy if the blue line rises very steeply.  It's a bad idea to sell when the orange line rises steeply.  These represent the relative amounts people are willing to pay for or cash out on BTC.  When either the orange or blue side is shallow, there is little preventing the price from moving past there, but the current "trend" of the market still counts too.
Here's another quick analysis: The market is rising, but it will encounter a large amount of resistance at $19.00.  Simply put, there are a lot of people willing to sell their BTC at this point (shown by the height of the blue line) However, if the market keeps buying and is able to eventually erode the price wall at this point, it will reach another point where it can move up much more quickly.  Another good "buy" point if you're not in the game.

There are a couple of things you need to consider before making an investment into mining.  
1) GPU and FPGA mining is essentially unprofitable at this point.  The difficulty of the network has climbed high enough to the point where you are churning out pennies a day. For instance, I have a GPU that I set up simply for testing purposes, it has a hashing rate of 92 Mh/s and makes about 
0.014 BTC/day.  
2) ASIC miners are the next generation technology that will push mining speeds much higher and faster, they are also priced similarly to graphics cards.  But remember that the network will always adjust it's difficulty so that bitcoins are created at a steady rate.  What people are forgetting is that we'll all be competing over the same amount of bitcoins (roughly worth $60,000 per day) at this rate.  What changes is each person's share of that based on their hashing power they purchased. 
3) A miner should not be thought of as a faucet that can simply be turned on and money will flow out.  The "flow" will exponentially decrease over time.  In about a year my 92 Mh/s GPU will likely only be able to churn out a penny per week. Meanwhile the costs for running a miner will always remain. Namely your electric bill, and keep in mind that electric components can fail.  Your miner can break and then you're up a creek.
4) One alternative to buying a miner is to simply buy Bitcoins and hold on to them if you think the price will increase.  It is certainly possible that you would make more money this way than if you invest in a Miner that cannot pay for itself in time.

[This thread answers some questions on what happens if you send bitcoins to the wrong address](
TL;DR - Addresses contain a checksum so that innocent typos often result in invalid addresses.  If the address is invalid, the transaction is rejected by the network and sent back.  If the address if valid and no one controls it, you're screwed.  If the address is valid and someone controls it, you are probably still screwed.

I wish.  This was an idea I argued (amicably) about with the developers over the summer.  
Yes its possible to set up a "delayed transaction" that will execute in the future.  But the problem is if your private key is stolen, someone can empty all the bitcoins out of an address before the transaction happens.
What would be far more useful in my opinion, is a way to execute a transaction as a delayed process.  This would be literally like telling the entire bitcoin network "Okay, these bitcoins are moving to that address in X amount of time, and if someone tries to move the coins again the whole process will reset."  
A failsafe is necessary, in case you get locked in a war with a thief over who's going to spend the coins, or in case you accidentally set the coins to send in too long an amount of time.  Having a whole chain of failsafe addresses located on different computers makes the coins practically immune to theft.  
If someone ever did steal your coins, you would know about it before the time limit expired.  They would have had to hack every failsafe computer in order to get the bitcoins back through the holes and extract them to an address they want.

Right where the green bid orders and red ask orders meet is where the price war is happening. 
 
* If red line is high, it means there are many BTC that need to be bought at this point and it will prevent the price from moving up until these orders are met.
* If the green line is high, it means there are many BTC waiting to be bought at this point and it will prevent the price from moving lower
* keep in mind that outside pressures can be influencing the direction of the market, independent of what these walls are
* If either side is low, then the opposite is true.  The price will have little resistance moving past this point.

You can also mention that if they don't want the bitcoin, payment providers will give them the fiat cheaper/faster than a credit card company can.  It's a win-win for all parties involved.

First of all, please please please enable 2 factor authentication on your account. 
Secondly, bitcoins are not meant to be stored on exchanges.  You should generally not pay other people/merchants from your bitcoins sitting on an exchange either because if something goes wrong with the transaction it can get complicated. 
Thirdly, you can chose a wallet  to store your bitcoins in a manner that doesn't leave your trust in the hands of a 3rd party.  An offline wallet is your own, it does not need to be verified, it just needs to sync with the network (the first time takes about a day). Wallets also have various other uses.  With the bitcoin-qt client for instance, you can sign a message with a transaction to prove its yours.  You can generate multiple addresses with one wallet, and sending/receiving coins is properly much faster than it is with a 3rd party site like MtGox.
**TL;DR - USE EXCHANGE SITES FOR CURRENCY EXCHANGE ONLY, USE WALLETS TO SEND/RECEIVE BTC**

Okay, here we go. 
I participated in the preorder for Avalon's Batch   This occured around 2/2 and 2/3 of 2013.  The site we used was: 
  
The payment processor for that site was walletbit.  It was a nightmare.  
This is the "official" avalon asic website: 
You might notice that for each preorder batch, they're using 3 different payment processors. 
Batch  [Paysius](
Batch  [Walletbit](
Batch  [Bitpay](
Yifu Guo, the creator of the Avalon, has stated that he's been using these different payment processors each time because the bitcoin industry as a whole is relatively new and he is trying to encourage their growth and awareness [source](
While there are numerous pictures and videos of real avalons by now, only about 4 of them have been documented in the wild. Including:
1.) [The one personally delivered to the Bitinstant Offices by Yifu](
2.) [The one Jeff Garzik (a key bitcoin developer) recieved way before anyone else as a thanks for his contribution to the whole project)](
3.) [The one that a Chinese user received and posted about in a forum](
**If you were interested in getting an ASIC miner in the quickest possible way** you basically have two options.
Plan A) Try to participate in the Avalon Preorder  which will deliver around april-may
Plan B) Try to wait until june-july for Butterfly labs for buttlerfly labs to process their orders
Or you could hope find one on ebay in the next few months., because some people will inevitably try to cash in on theirs.

The short answer is no.  CPU's can no longer profitably mine for bitcoins.  The network will always self adjust it's payout depending on the total power that the userbase is feeding into it. 
CPU's were used first, then GPUs, finally FPGA (field programmable gate array chips) and now the latest evolution of mining tech is ASIC. 
ASIC is very difficult and expensive to make, only one company has been so far successful in delivering it to the public, and as such they are currently enjoying a monopoly and charging high prices for it.  (AVALON)  
The other company is Butterfly Labs, but they've suffered from about 8 months of delays and currently their prototypes aren't performing as well as expected.  
To be perfectly honest, now is *not* the best time to get into mining.
@_date: 2013-03-04 21:01:19
Fine, I'm going to say it: 
I wont be that excited about a new card until I see the fees.  One of the main advantages for merchants accepting bitcoin is that they don't have to pay a credit card to conduct transactions. 
So what would it cost to put money on this card and use it? Who pays, the merchant or the consumer?  In my mind, the card is almost a necessity to introduce the average person to bitcoin and bring it to the forefront of the marketplace.  But I hope there's enough competition to keep fees low.

The difficulty rise has really been quite astonishing, but nowhere near unprecedented.  
The unfortunate news is that it's very possible for nearly *every* miner to lose money simultaneously if there are too many people doing it.  It's almost like a malthusian trap, too many mouths to feed and not enough bread to go around. 
I'd expect the difficulty to level off as folks eventually come to grips with the reality they're facing.  However, at the same time there might be quite a few that simply keep rationalizing "Well great, now I have to mine for 2 years to meet ROI!"

**[Ziggap.com]( has a fairly good track record.  I've used them on a number of occasions without complaint.  The coins typically arrive within the hour, sometimes within just a few minutes after a deposit is made.  Their fees are modest, at about 4.49% the current market rate. 
**Coinbase** I used to recommend due to their lower fees, but long wait times, strict limits on bitcoin purchases, and poor customer service has turned me off lately.
**Bitinstant** is still pretty useful if you're looking to put USD directly into MtGox.  I've never had a problem with them for that purpose.

While it is typical for most cash deposit transactions to clear within an hour, it is not unheard of for them to take longer, especially if you're a first time customer.  I had several transactions take less than 30 minutes, and one that took 4 hours.

The chart above uses MtGox data.  I'd love to see more long term bid/ask ratios from the other big exchanges if anyone knows where to find them.  
For now in the short term, the trend does seem consistent  among the big three: **
What's causing this?  A couple of possible scenarios (more than one could be true)
* Opportunists have simply removed their bid support at high price levels and put their orders in at lower spots: 
* Most of those who did want to sell didn't actually put up ask orders, they simply sold at the current market rate.  
* Ask resistance remains low because those who want out are waiting for the price to climb back up. 
In any case, it's fascinating to see the evolving situation here.

There used to be a service like this called bitspend.  I was admittedly very eager to do business with them, but despite having a promising concept and a professional looking site (touting customer privacy) they bungled it up badly. 
The idea was that if you wanted to buy something online, you just send them the URL, give them the BTC, and they pay the merchant USD on your behalf for a marginal fee.  In my opinion, this business model is still pretty sound.  If bitspend failed to deliver, you would have a brick and mortar business to go after.  
But for whatever reason bitspend ran afoul of their banking partners (who froze their accounts).  
I wouldn't be surprised if someone else tries to fill this void soon.

With respect to the fact that it must be used responsibly, I am deeply worried that the rest of the world will be able to fully grasp this tech before the US even comes to awareness.

Oh wow, so if I understand you correctly here... buying a BFL FPGA rig back in early 2012 wouldn't have netted you a profit even today?
What's harder for me to estimate is just how the price of Bitcoins will change over time.  I could buy X amount of bitcoins today and see that value rise and fall, or I could accumulate an increasingly diminishing amount of coins continuously, and value of those coins would rise or fall based on the market.
I guess the important factor to note is that at some point, would my mining rig actually make enough BTC to be equal or greater than that X original investment cost.  If it does in a reasonable amount of time, then mining might seem like the better option for 2 simple reasons.
1) You're now the owner of a pile of BTC worth as much as your original investment 
2) That pile of BTC will continue to grow via your mining rig, although admittedly at an increasingly slower rate.

This is just a layman's explanation, but: The nodes have to come to an agreement on where the balance is. They do so by referencing the blockchain. 
Say you control both addresses, 1 and 2. 
If you send a bitcoin to an empty address, 2, you'll notice that a wallet doesn't give you the option to send the new funds if they're unconfirmed.  They will remain unconfirmed and "on their way"  until they are included in a block.

I'm tempted to *not* write this answer, because I don't want more people thinking this way.  
If you look at a [graph of the network hash rate]( You'll see two precipitous drops.  One was in 2011 when the first price gouge happened, and afterwards people either sold or turned off their miners.  And then this past december there was a pretty substantial price drop again as the block reward halved.
Many people "mine" using calculators that tell them the profitability in terms of todays bitcoin value.  But try thinking in terms of what you think bitcoin could be a year or two from now.  What do you think?  50? 100?  It's not as risky as you think to just leave your miner plugged in for the hell of it to see how many bitcoins you can get.  Who *knows* what they could be worth someday.  How many of those miners do you think would have stayed in last December if they new what the BTC price was today? ($30 instead of $4-5 at the time)
Because bitcoins are artificially scarce, there is always the possibility that demand will outstrip the supply, in which case the price skyrockets.

And you're right, I didn't really explain in detail what a bounty is:  it's just the sum total of the items that bitcoin users have saved in their wishlists for a particular merchant.

Over time as more people do this the Steam bounty will add up to thousands, tens of thousands, perhaps even millions of dollars.

If you ever use a bitcoin exchange, use it for exchanging currency only.  If you're going to send coins, make sure to transfer coins first to a wallet only you control.  
**NEVER** pay 3rd parties directly out of your exchange account.  Doing so is usually a violation of the exchange site's TOS, and likely the gambling site's TOS. If things go wrong with the payment, then it's complicated to get your money back and it's usually up to the discretion of the exchange site.

My first guess is the coinlab transfer
my second guess is that someone is repositioning coins to cash out.  Interestingly though, the market can't tolerate that much of a sell off. If they tried to do it all at once, they would lose about 5 mill due to slippage and the price would move down to the 80s.  It would be an absolute buy frenzy.

You would have to be smart about it and not just pay in a predetermined amount of bitcoins but an amount of fiat that is converted to bitcoins.  
* Imagine that I have an agreement with my employer to pay me 2 bitcoins per week.  The employer does this with 100 employees.  At the years end the company would have had to have purchased 10,400 BTC just to pay us all.  If you don't already see the problem I'll keep going.  
Imagine that a mere 100 companies did this practice (each with 100 employees, paid just 2 BTC per week on average. After a year they would have all collectively purchased 1,080,000 BTC.  Which is just over 5% of the amount of bitcoin that will ever be created.  Obviously such a trend can't continue as the companies would go bankrupt or have to void such contracts.  Bitcoin is very sensitive to purchases of even 1,000 coins in a short timespan.  
Instead it's likely you might set up a contract with an employer to set up X% of your fiat paycheck in BTC, which would result in less actual bitcoins (at the same value) over time as the value increased.
Even easier, nix the contract with your employer altogether and just buy bitcoin with your paycheck.

Deflation really refers to the deflating prices, while the currency itself is increasing in proportional value.
Think of it this way.  If you bought $10 worth of BTC today, and some time later you sold it for $20, the reason why you could do that is that the demand for BTC went up during that time.  It became more scarce, and people became willing to pay you more for that same amount of BTC.

As far as I understand it, Coinlab is not directly setting up a wall street exchange.  They are just bringing the BTC to American shores in an effort to connect customers with their money more easily.  This move would make it *easier* to set up a Wall Street exchange in the future, but this is not it.

Hey thanks for the feedback!  
You're definitely headed in the right direction.  The big problem is that we're trying to make it so that even by knowing the private key the coins couldn't be spent instantly. 


Just curious, in your example how would this second private key be stored and protected? 
An extra blockchain is most definitely a hassle, and a necessary one too. It splits the control of your coins into 2 keys. One key you control, and the other is bound up in a trustless distributed network that will require certain rules to be followed in order to decrypt that key.  
This makes it so that it is necessary, but no longer sufficient to hack your computer's hot wallet!

This has happened already.  Litecoin is a sort of sister currency that was launched months after BTC.

Not just the pool operator, but everyone using that pool pretty much knows that &gt;50% hashpower is bad for the stability of BTC.  In simple terms of human psychology, both the operator and the users have an incentive to limit the guild's power in this case.  
We're kind of at a critical junction because so many AVALON asic units are being delivered, and only a few pools were ASIC ready to begin with.  Other pools like 50btc.com are just now getting with the program and soon ASIC users should be able to pool with pretty much anyone.

You'd be right to notice that bitcoin hardware can lose its value very quickly.  The biggest question is whether it can earn you more bitcoin than simply buying it outright will. 
Bitcoin stocks are usually hyped more than the currency itself.  Asicminer is a classic example of this.  Huge spike and then drop once reality set in.  Shares of a company are also inherently risky because they can be diluted. 
Bitcoin itself is probably your best bet.  Just be sure you safely store your coins!  Use either with a trusted online provider using 2-factor authentication, or with your own personal wallet on an offline computer. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 14:39:17
This is pretty correct, but two things:
1) We're usually trusting the pool operators to do what is best for bitcoin (i.e. BTC guild voluntarily limiting its hashpower to avoid going over 50%) But in reality most pools will make decisions that bring them the most money
2) Miners pointing their machines towards one pool or another to "vote" is not a democratic process. It's based on hashpower, not the number of miners
@_date: 2013-10-01 09:44:05
That is a HUGE amount of hashpower.  I honestly didn't think we'd see 28nm ASICs so soon this year, but here they come.    Mining for bitcoins is about to get a whole lot more difficult, and it will be far easier to obtain them at market prices.

Also, when you see enormous sell walls like this pop up there is only one thing to do: make them pay.  Not only do you chew into their coins with little slippage, they end up with less market power and they have to use that cash to buy back in. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 06:48:34
You might have to consider what the difficulty actually is for a second.  It's a representation of how much power is being contributed towards bitcoin mining, and it's an adjustment factor so that a block is found roughly every 10 minutes.  More often than this and you have more blocks, and more bitcoin being released.  Less often and you have less blocks and less bitcoin.  
So many people have bought into this idea of bitcoin because [they believe in this graph]( If you start to mess with the payouts you'll get too much bitcoin (and the price will plummet) or you get too little (and the price will skyrocket and no one will mine.)
Unfortunately now that the ball is rolling on bitcoin, it's impossible to change this payout schedule without severe repercussions. 
Now, honestly if I were going to do it, I would have made the payout logarithmically decrease much less quickly.  We've already found more than 50% of the coins in the first 4 years, and the consequence of that is the price bucking like a wild bronco.  Either way, I suppose the worst of it is over.  We're now entering a zone of stability that will continue for the next 3 years, until the reward rate halves again.

The Bitcoin price is largely determined by three things.
1) The psychology/general mood of the market, and how they perceive recent news about bitcoin. Examples:
* Big profits from bitcoin gambling? Price increase
* Cyprus Bank Seizure talk and FinCen Acknowledgement? Price Increase
* New poorly understood events like a big blockchain fork? Price decrease
* Coinlab moving operations to the US? Price increase
* Various 3rd Party Services get hacked? Price decrease
What you have to gauge in each situation is the potential impact (big or small) of such a piece of news, and how the community as a whole feels about it (more or less confident in the BTC)  Note that as a whole, the community can also tend to make an irrational decision at first.  There was a big sell off at first news of the fork, and then people quickly realized it also wasn't as big of a deal as they thought.
2) The various bid and ask walls surrounding the price.  **If you're only paying attention to the price of bitcoin, you're doing it wrong.**  It's a good idea to become familiar with the various "walls" that build up at various points in the order book.  These should be taken with a grain of salt, because anyone can place an order and sometimes manipulate the system, but in general 
* high walls mean a lot of resistance to moving past that point, 
* low walls mean the price can jump up and down very quickly.
3) Other variables such as the rate that coins are created (currently 3600 a day) When this rate halves again in 3.5 years, demand will likely outstrip supply again and the price will increase.

There would probably be a class action lawsuit initiated by the folks that still had money in there.  Whether or not they receive what they're owed would be a different story, but there's enough capital there that lawyers would be hired, and shit would hit the fan. 
I don't believe MtGox has any reason to close their market however. Volatility is good business for them.  They get a small percentage cut of every trade.  Right now this is taxing the crap out of their servers, but besides that they should be fine.  They're only in trouble if more people start withdrawing USD than what they have in storage.
Someone else will have to confirm this, but unless I'm mistaken there was a brief period after the crash of 2011 where they closed their exchange for a few days.  There were a few days on the all time data chart where no trades were executed at all

You may very well be right, but in the short term? human psychology trumps whatever forces you're talking about.  
Bitcoin jumped about 45% in the past week.  It's completely unsustainable growth.  Nearly every bitcoin user is keenly aware of what happened last time.  I believe in BTC but unfortunately it is prone to run ups like this due to scarcity.  Has the market really added the equivlane of $100,000,000 USD in the past 2 days? NO, BTC is overbought, I'll see you in a few weeks once the correction settles.

I have to echo some of the redditors here that caution against cashing out a million (or half a million) in USD.  
First, depending on your withdrawal method you will probably want to have a conversation with your bank.  Then, make sure your taxes are in order. 
And if you're going to make big purchases anyway, try going through a service like  which let's you purchase anything for sale on the internet via bitcoins.

Transferring bitcoins out of MtGox and into your wallet is usually a simple process.  
If you bought bitcoins, and then "withdrew" them by copying your own bitcoin address then the BTC is on its way.  You just have to wait for your wallet to sync on its own and it will eventually catch up to the present.

Good points, it's tough to speculate on how many people are making up the 125 bid line, but it's abrupt appearance is one indication that it may be primarily made up of a few large or even a single large bid order.

Bitspend is a 3rd party company that adjusts their prices frequently to reflect the current market rates.  How often they do so is up to them.

Ripple is basically supposed to be the next big way to exchange money.  Think of it as a decentralized money exchange, in which you can trade bitcoins, dollars, euro, whatever.  
You can even hold bitcoin in a ripple wallet, but you need to move through specialized exchanges (like bitstamp) to get it there. Someday MtGox may have this feature.
All the ripples were created at the beginning, so there is no deflationary increase in value like bitcoin.  In fact, many people see ripple as something that can *complement* rather than compete with BTC.  One problem however, is that the creators of ripple kept a sizeable chunk of the 100 billion 'ripple' and plan on distributing the rest.  I'll let you drawn your own conclusions.  The supposed big advantage is that such a decentralized exchange would make it so that people don't have to rely on places like MtGox.
It's still in beta, and it has a long way to go before being useful.  I'm not terribly impressed to be honest.

The funny part is that the reverse of this is impossible with bitcoins.

I'm not going to say it's impossible, but it's extremely unlikely.  
The mining software is not designed for this, you would have to get a pool to subvertly try send work designed to crack passwords, which I'm not sure many people would agree with (especially because it would cut into their profits) 
Currently the network is powerful enough to brute force a 13-15 character password in about 10 minutes.  How do we know this?  Check out some of the latest blocks, that's the number of zeroes submitted in front of the correct hash 
One such correct hash was 
(That's 14 leading zeroes)
But as the password gets longer it gets exponentially harder.   You would need a network power ten times more powerful just to get one more character, and a million times more powerful just to get 6 more characters.  
But hashing for a block and hashing for a password are computationally different.  Not my area of expertise but I'm not sure it would be easy or worthwhile. If bitcoin really needs to defend itself the best option might be to use some of it's own self-generated resources

Market manipulation is a factor that we all have to contend with in a free market, but a person's power is usually limited insofar as their wallet size. 
When people actually talk about "manipulating" the market the actual means are more obvious than you would think.  If someone wants to try to force the market in a particular direction, they can create a large bid or ask wall at a certain price point to either prevent further movement or encourage more of it.  
 Furthermore as the price of the bitcoin rises and the coins get more dispersed, the market becomes harder to manipulate because individuals are holding less and less of the total share of coins.

A very important day to celebrate in the future is the next halving day, when the block reward is cut from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.  Bitcoins will become more scarce, and assuming buy pressure remains the same the price will climb in the following months.  
It's hard to get a precise estimate of when the next halving day is right now at the rate we keep changing the diffulty, but mid to early 2016 is likely.

This might sound cold, but I feel no obligation to go out of my way to support other bitcoin miners *in the way you describe* through donations.  Doing so only creates a system that would rely on charity to meet its margins.  In a free market competition for the bitcoin, I think it's up to the miners themselves to innovate if they are not comfortable with their current payouts.  
That being said.  There are still methods I employ that can indirectly help the miners get a bigger payout. 
* Do what I can to grow the bitcoin economy.  More transactions = more transaction fees for the miners!
* Stop selling my bitcoins for USD.  Less sell pressure relative to more demand = a higher exchange price.  
Outside of this, I am quite content to let the competitive mining market take care of itself.

What kind of project are you looking to put together?  
I was also looking for potential partners, it seems I've got a lot of ideas, a fair amount of capital, business smarts and social skill, yet not as much actual programming skill.  
The first idea I was trying to implement involves allowing bitcoiners to create wish-lists of items they want to buy with BTC.  The value of their items is added and totaled into a growing bounty that can be shown to merchants as an incentive to accept BTC. [I Made a quick video of the idea too.](
Secondly, I wanted to see if I could bring a few [robocoin ATMs]( to the cities surrounding me.  But this would definitely require registering for an MSB and it would make sense to partner up with other people looking to do the same.

All bitcoins exist at addresses that include a pair of number sets.  These can be thought of as the public key and the private key portions.  
Sharing the public key is safe because you cannot easily compute what the private key attached to it is.  In fact with bitcoin, its effectively impossible.  
Sharing a private key is not safe because you can easily compute what public address is associated with it.  Additionally, if a private key is known, this along with the public key is the overall combination required to spend an amount of coins at a bitcoin address. 
The keys are not stored because it is very easy for other programs to check if the public-private key is valid or invalid combination, but it is very hard for other programs to guess what a private key might be just from knowing its public counterpart.

So what do you mean they're monitoring your account, you mean via blockchain? Or internally?
I wouldn't worry about it too much, if the price drops immediately after you buy a large order like that, a number of people might want to cash out after such a buy, internally or not, if they're selling their coins it's their loss, you can always do a "half now, half later" approach or better, chuck in a portion and build the rest as support levels.  
Either way OP, every sell off has a floor, if you're in this for the long haul you can take your coins and sleep easy. Try not to sell for a loss.

Alternative cryptocurrencies aren't a terrible idea.  Bitcoin is the oldest and most popular simply by virtue of its primacy.  Some users probably fear that litecoin is taking away from the BTC market share of likely investors, but I'm not too worried about this.  
Not only do substantial alternative currencies help ensure that none of them grows "too big, too fast," but it reinforces the idea that we shouldn't all be putting our eggs in one basket.  If something were to ever become drastically unstable with one alt currency, the others will be there to pick up the slack.  
Litecoin may perpetually be the silver to bitcoin's gold however, its hard limit is 84 million LTC, which means by definition it will be difficult for its value to ever surpass more than 1/4 of a bitcoin unless there's an extreme imbalance of demand.

Coinbase is low cost, but one of the slowest ways to receive bitcoins.  I personally do not use them.  
Funding a Bitfloor account with a bank deposit and buying them directly is arguably a very quick way to buy bitcoins within a day or so.  
Bitinstant is one of the quickest ways to get BTC, you make a cash deposit and the coins arrive at your address within hours (sometimes less)  They've had mixed reviews lately, but they are also a longstanding legitimate company that is trying to do good.
Technically if you're going to be buying/selling coins on a larger basis long term, it can be a good idea to get a verified Mtgox account.  Dwolla transfers cost a quarter each way, and generally take a day or 2.

It's theoretically possible, 
From a business standpoint MtGox has publicly state that none of their employees are allowed to trade on the exchange.  Whether or not you believe this is up to you.

It means at this present time, there are a number of sell orders from people who own bitcoin worth ~2,130 BTC that are preventing the price from moving up to that point.  This particular point is taking into account all of the sell orders below it too, that's why it grows as it gets farther away from the current price range.
There are two ways to buy and sell in an exchange market
* You can buy/sell immediately with a market order, that gets or sells coins at whatever prices are currently available.  
* Or you can plan to buy/sell coins at a certain price by putting in an open order.  If I have 10 BTC and I am adamant that I want $90 for all of them, I will put that order in and it will only be completed if someone buys for that price.  
Importantly, these orders can change at any time, rapidly, for no cost.  So be wary of where they are and if they are truly legitimate.

well that's exactly the point.  We'd like to think that miners have this quasi-democratic power of "1-vote per hash" 
But the reality is that miners are more or less forced to join several big pools, and some mining companies like ASICminer are going solo because they have such a large share of the hashpower.  As mining becomes more competitive it's shifting away from the consumer and towards the capabilities of corporations.  We're trusting these pools and companies to essentially make decisions that will benefit them financially.  It's good that they're in competition with one another (and I hope there always will be that sense of competition) because the last thing we need is a miner deciding that they will only accept ridiculously high fee transactions.

False.  
Tansactions are noted in the orderbook at a price by price basis.  You can see tiny amounts on both the buy and sell sides of the orderbook.  If I go ahead and buy/sell a large amount of bitcoins, it will chew through each price point and display it as a buy and sell.  So me simply clicking the button to buy 50 bitcoins may show up as a chain of 10-12 buys all at once, these little buys included.  
If someone really wants to manipulate the orderbook, the will put a huge buy wall right beneath the price to inflate it, or an ask wall right on top of it to try to force it down.   
For an effective way of seeing how the order book changes over time, try referencing a historical depth chart

Here's a benefit: these kinds of changes may allow the owners of a bitcoin address an immense amount of power over how their coins are spent there, and absolutely no power over how other people's coins are spent.  What kind of changes could be made?
Say you have 100 BTC sitting at your address.  You've created a special condition for the coins at that address such that if they are ever going to be spent, the entire bitcoin network is in agreement that they cannot leave your wallet until 144 confirmations have passed, you will have the power to cancel a transaction prior to this, and there is a failsafe in effect that will allow you to instantly send the coins back to their origin: a previous address that you controlled in a different wallet.
So one day a malware program comes along and sits on top of your wallet.dat file just waiting for it to unencrypt.  You decide to spend 1 Bitcoin, and in the brief moment that your wallet had to unlock when you type in your password, the malware steals your private key and sends it off to a thief.  
The thief attempts to import your private key and spend your remaining 99 Bitcoins.  But he too is constrained by the same rules you set up with these coins.  It's literally like saying "You can take my money out of my bank, but if you try to spend it I'll know about it right away and I'll be able to send the money right back to another bank of mine."  
Thief goes to transfer out your 99 BTC.  None of it leaves his wallet.  An "intention" is broadcast on the network that gets included in the blocks, saying that your 99 BTC will be available to spend in the next 144 confirmations.  
You get this notification in your wallet.  You can cancel the transaction yourself by spending the coins (which will again take 144 confirmations as the intention is re-newed) or you can instantly send the coins to a failsafe wallet that you control.  (because they've been there previously)  
Bitcoin uses an interpreted scripting system to determine whether an output's criteria have been satisfied, with which more complex operations are possible.  Sending coins to an address you control means that you and you alone can define certain output scripts that must be satisfied before the coins are spent again.

Just not possible, Bitcoin is still undergoing inflation and in four years the miners would still be uncovering 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes on average. (1800 BTC per day = $1,800,000,000 being  mined in value per day) 
We won't see this kind of pricing until bitcoin becomes *very* scarce in the future.

Is it the same story with the google authentication?

You could try Coinbase or CampBX, both are US based and both have 2-factor security. 
More hard-line bitcoiners will tell you to use cold storage if you don't plan on spending/moving your bitcoins anytime soon, but that isn't always the easiest or most desirable option.

Yup. People in the MtGox market don't even have the luxury of selling for $43 now, its 37.544 at the time of this writing.

Dude yea I noticed that too, getting a little frustrated.  I just got paid today and wanted to buy coins.  Bitinstant is my preferred MtGox supplier, but I can also vouch for [Ziggap](  They have pretty decent rates.

Just a reminder this all came about because MtGox failed to register with FinCen properly.  Mother of god.

I've been a longtime minecrafter and I've been interested in Bitvegas as well, I hope it succeeds!  
But if possible, I'd like to see the advent of more (skill based) games that reward BTC.  For instance, players ante up and compete in challenges against one another for top prizes.  The house takes a small cut to sustain itself.  
Pig racing, Archery, **Hungercraft**, spleefing, capture the flag... these are definitely events I would pony up for.  Even if its just a few millibits at a time

Nope, Batch  Avalon's are scheduled to start shipping April 15th. Those units only cost $1500.  Batch  units on May 5th.  Those cost about ~$5k

okay, I fixed it now.  you have to make sure that your phone's time is synced with google servers.  That was scary.
(there is an option to sync the time within the settings of the program on the phone)
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:53:46
Bitcoins cost as much as they do right now partly due to the fact that there just aren't that many around (relative to the number of people who want to buy them) 
So if you want to obtain BTC, you can either buy it or mine it.  In the years past it's been fairly easy to just spend money on mining equipment and scoop it up.  
As time goes on, actual mining payouts trickle down and the only possible way to obtain BTC will be to buy it.  Throw in the hard-capped 21 million limit, and it's the Berkshire Hathaway of currencies.

Without Dwolla, the ability to buy BTC via credit card will be absolutely crucial to the growth of the currency.  There is a huge demand for such a service and indeed there are several companies attempting such an endeavour, but chargebacks are a big reason why this kind of business model hasn't been fully implemented.  But why should a few bad apples spoil the bunch?  I have no intention of ever issuing a chargeback, and no problem providing my identity to a reputable company.  If they're selling near instant BTC via CC I'm more than happy to give them my business!  I do have a few suggestions however:
1) Cut down on the rate of chargebacks and fees by giving customers the *option* to purchase memberships.  I.e. I pay you $10 a month or $100 a year to have a bulk discount.  Not only will it attract more large scale buyers, but your members will be much less likely to try a chargeback given their standing financial commitments.  If I've paid for a years membership, I'm much less likely to try to chargeback knowing it could freeze my account.  
2) Security, security security.  You do NOT want your business to become a target of user theft.  Enable 2 factor authentication for logins and pretty much every account action imaginable. Also give users the option to "lock in" a withdrawal addresses that cannot be changed without significant due process and notification.  I.e: if I ever use my CC to buy BTC, I only want it to go to one of a handful of trusted addresses that I control, never one that is potentially not mine.  I supply a list of addresses at setup that I will only ever use, and these cannot be changed without a weeks notice.
3) Register as an MSB to be FinCEN compliant.  
4) Consider allowing reverse transactions, giving people USD for BTC.  You can set your own market rate to cover the overhead cost and stay competitive with the exchanges.  But this of course is another line of business and risk entirely.

Faster than Light is actually really fun and addictive.  It might look simple but it's also pretty dang difficult with loads of customization.  Fez is also great I hear.  
Bought the last bundle for double the average, it was very easy with coinbase.  If you're on the edge of making a decision, give it a shot!  
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:25:59
One of the big problems is that most users do not even know how to communicate with a program through its API.  Understanding which commands do what is fairly simple, but I haven't seen a good explanation of how to even get to the point of where you can input these commands.

The interesting thing is that difficulty doesn't experience the same kind of fluctuations as price.  There is no bubble we're expecting to pop.  Bitcoins would have to become near worthless before many stopped mining, so when the difficulty rises the miners essentially just get angrier while a few turn off, or people become more likely to simpy buy BTC instead of new mining equipment. 
What I like is that scarce bitcoins are always a good thing (since I own them).  If it costs about $1,000 to mine a single bitcoin in a day, then lucky me indeed

I have to upvote you so other users can see your mistake.  In my opinion theft is never the fault of the victim.  Leaving a pie on a windowsill does not given anyone the right to eat it, Password protecting your mtgox account does not give someone the right to design malware that can get past it.  Just know that there are things you can do to further protect yourself and 2 factor is definite it.  I don't even use the bitcoin-qt client anymore because it's "only" password protected. 
MtGox (and pretty much every BTC service) could greatly benefit if the following features were implemented in addition to 2-factor
-Locked withdrawal addresses
-non-user controlled withdrawal limits that take significant due process and notification to change
-Time delay on withdrawals with option to cancel
-Email confirmation on withdrawals

This is a VERY difficult question to address, because you have to consider that: 
* just prior to 2013, nearly all of the network power was built on GPU and FPGA units.  As the difficulty rises, many of these will be switched off due to unprofitability.  
* The network difficulty can somewhat mirror the price fluctuations in BTC.  If the price goes up, everyone wants to mine.  If the price drops, it can be unprofitable for some. 
* The increase we saw so far this year is primarily due to ASICminer and Batch  Avalon orders slowly trickling out (many delayed due to the chinese new year)
* Avalon Batch  has 600 units shipping on April 15th, likely much quicker than Batch 
* Avalon Batch  has 600 Units shipping May 5th 
* BFL is a total crapshoot at the moment.  While they may deliver a 
working product, no one can say how it will perform, how quickly they can ship, and when they will ship.  
* Another company could try to sweep in and offer ASIC units, but it is unlikely they could deliver by summer.
@_date: 2013-04-25 17:35:27
Here's what you need to know:
* the Mars Unit is an FPGA unit that gets 6 GH/s
* This is a generation of tech that's more advanced than GPU and less advanced than ASIC. 
* they plan on releasing it fairly quickly, ordering should open in the next few days.  
* The price is absolutely ridiculous at $2,795 per unit.  
* It's only worth it if they can deliver fairly quickly.  
* Those who purchase it can use it as a $2000 trade in credit towards the Jupiter
* It's pretty obvious that they're using the Mars to help generate startup capital to help finance the Jupiter.  If you were planning on buying the $7 to 8k Jupiter anyway, then the Mars represents a $800 total investment for a miner while you wait. I'm still not buying it however, because too many things can go wrong and 3 grand for an FGPA is ridiculous. 
Butterfly Labs currently has a 5 GH/s unit that sells for $274.  If you order it right now however, you would not likely get it until after summer or fall.

Indeed let's take stock.  The question of "whether a government run off donations (i.e. voluntary taxes) is stable" is indeed a scientific one.  But I'm not aware that any experiment around such a hypothesis has ever been conducted.
You can request citation all you want, but because there never *has* been a government run **entirely** on donations there isn't any proof that it will work.  The Vatican might be the best example we can think of, but it also has extraneous variables that bring in revenue other than what its members could generate on its own.
There's no need to get flustered, but that is the reason why we're stuck debating over this philosophically rather than pouring over the historical results of a known study.  
Could a government be run entirely on voluntary donations from its own members? That is the central issue I am fixated on.  I do not think so.
Once you begin to add additional streams of revenue, outside help, or non-voluntary taxes, the picture of government seems more stable.  But entirely on voluntary taxes alone?  I don't have that much confidence in altruism.
