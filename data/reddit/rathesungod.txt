So, what're you going to do with all of them?
Invest in something and donate profits? (mining or something...)

I bought at $15... in the middle of that fall you mentioned.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:35:19
That's in Zimbabwe dollars.

Weird. It's not working for me - and I'm pretty sure I'm using a testnet address.

You're correct, they're given to the miner who finds the block that includes that transaction.
The transaction fees don't amount to much, but it varies rather heavily, because they're from transactions.
You can check per block here:
Pool choice is interesting; each of the pools basically has some benefit/disadvantage to them over the others.

You do have to admit it's fun to watch, though, right?

From experience, they're good, but it takes a while. Expect a few days before you get the coins you would be buying now.

Are BTC withdrawls enabled at all or do they all error with "pls contact support?"
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:07:14
Well, I'm not going to be getting one then. The Jalapeno was pretty much what I could afford.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:04:46
Always late.
1RaSaksVL8iVtqHrGCfJtsoUkag2Uctqj is my address for anyone who cares, though.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:17:49
Well, yeah.
It's pretty much gone from a 'might order when they're shipping' to 'will not order'.

Actually, we bought at 48 and still don't have our btc. 
@_date: 2013-07-31 04:05:08
Any news?
@_date: 2013-03-24 18:52:23
Ugh, this is the kind of thing I'd rather not have BTC associated with...
