SS: Particl welcomes Bitcoin users to its Open Marketplace with the mainnet release of the Particl Desktop 2.3.0 client. This new client update introduces the brand new in-wallet exchange module on Particl’s live network. This exchange acts as a great complement to the Open Marketplace, allowing you to quickly and easily swap your BTC for PART and buy products and services completely anonymous. Finally you dont have to leave the crypto ecosystem anymore. Please give it a try and provide some feedback!
