this applies to financial instruments, not money.  i don't read it, at least the way its described in the article (read very quickly), as applying to bitcoin transactions since btc is considered money (admittedly, depending on the office, btc is not considered money).  perhaps sidechains or counterparty instruments/tokens would be within its scope.  lastly, this legislation is more about making a statement before 2016 - no way a republican controlled congress lets this one pass.

This guy worked w/ them too : 
I presume joke or whatever.

LOL.  You deserve more upvotes for linking that one.

I think its highly unlikely its bitcoin, but it is fun to dream - that's how it starts.

I think he's certain to do some time, but couldn't guess how much. What appears true to you and I, may appear totally different to the jury, judge, and others present at the trial.- for better or for worse. Those perceptions will definitely impact sentencing.

Not really.  I want to know the reason why its stupid to "even think" they'd be interested in bitcoin.  Besides, I never said or suggested it was bitcoin - you assumed that I did, and you know what they say about assumptions. Generally, your post history suggests you need to get laid or something. Chill.

b/c the costs of setting up that payment infrastructure could be paid for overtime w/ savings from reduced transaction costs. i think its inevitable anyway - only a question of when.

Thx!  Looks like its rapidly getting cheaper.

Interesting.  What about this: Willy was a govt bot that Karples couldn't control. Govt would have placed the bot for some reason - to get coins for blockchain tracing purposes, having been tipped off by DHS about a possible relationship between DPR/SR and Gox.  The defense's theory RE: identity of DPR was kept secret so well, I can't help but think there's going to be another plot twist or two.

Warrant for that claim?

Actually, we negotiated and executed a settlement and licensing agreement.

RE: Tx fee - Where can I read a little more about that?  Is the 9.48 per bitcoin?  I've bought lots of things w/ bitcoin and have helped a few friends get set up to take bitcoin on their websites - haven't seen anything transaction costs like you're mentioning.  Genuinely interested in your point.

Reasonable doubt doesn't seam so far fetched in this case anymore.           
If true, the defendant's theory of the case would resolve a number of unknowns that put a bit of a cloud over the industry.           
 
EDIT 1 - If the defense's theory is good, I suspect the prosecution may start throwing deals at the defendant.  If that happens, it will be interesting to see whether the Defendant takes one - should be a window into what the defense thinks of their own case.       
EDIT 2 - Would love, love, love to know what the Japanese criminal investigators know.
