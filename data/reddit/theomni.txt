Nice. I tried checking my records (searching my gmail account), and I don't have a receipt with the BTC amount on it, but I do have the Mt.Gox notice that I deposited 110USD and I know I immediately converted to BTC and spent it all back in March 2012. Not sure what the rate was then.

How do I get Bitcoin back into USD? In the FAQ and such I see resources for buying bitcoin, but if I already have bitcoin and want to put some of it back to USD and into my checking account what are some ways?

Awkward question. I don't really keep up on the Bitcoin news that much. What is Etherium and what is going on with the stuff this post is talking about?

I don't follow bitcoin super closely. Is there any simple way to tell roughly what the transaction fees and times are? Without actually sending or trying to send btc.

About an hour after this happened I finally got the notice from Dwolla that my transfer went through so I can finally move that over to Mt.Gox and buy some coin. So that was kind of crappy timing.

Like it or not, Silk Road is one of the major retail sites that use Bitcoin, and easily the largest that uses Bitcoin exclusively. So it is pretty relevant.

I am really sorry this happened to you, but it is very unlikely to be a problem on Mt.Gox's end. It is very similar to MMO account compromises (like WoW). There are a few things that could have happened. Least likely, but most troublesome, is that your computer is compromised and infected with a keylogger or some other password sniffing malicious program which obtained your Mt.Gox account name and password, then the thieves were able to simply log in, purchase coin, and withdraw.
More likely is that they stole your username and password from a different site. It's a common strategy where they will attack and attempt to retrieve username and password combinations from small forums, fansites, any sort of small time website that doesn't have the same security a big one will have, and then try that username and password combination on other more well protected sites. Gmail, paypal, ebay, Battle.net, anything with something of value in it.
Mt.Gox does offer extra security steps that would protect against these sort of attacks, such as Yubikey or Google Authenticator, but they are not enabled by default since many people will actually consider them burdensome and complain.

On the one hand, if I saved what I used in 2012 I'd have half a million. On the other hand, I had it on mt. Gox before I spent it, so I'd probably have lost it anyways.

Not excited about this. Personally, I would rather people think of Bitcoin as the money of internet drug dealers instead of internet white supremacists.

That's why they call it the present

Hey, I'm in Rochester! 
I don't actually go to this bar though, but this is cool to hear about.

The class comment is weird. You mention things being "reality" that are as class restricted as Bitcoin, if not more. I get, but may not agree with, your other statements, but throwing in that class comment seems weird and not internally consistent.

I think this logic goes circular pretty quickly.

Yeah, the mining, especially mining efficiently, is out of reach of a lot of people. But that's not really meant or expected to be the primary method of acquiring bitcoins. It's hard to compare it to existing currency systems, but I think you can kind of compare it to gold. Gold can be a useful currency system (I'm definitely not advocating a return to the gold standard) but very few people have the means to mine it.
