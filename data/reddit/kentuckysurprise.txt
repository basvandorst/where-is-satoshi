Please make this post. The community needs it. My general theory is that tether may or may not be fraudulent, but there is a massive campaign to make it out to be much more than it is and to stymy the progress of bitcoin. The writing’s on the wall for me.

Have any links to support this? 
In the United States both individuals and organizations have exactly 15 days (sometimes less) to respond to a subpoena by providing all of their compliance records and information. 
What are the deadlines for responding to a Subpoena?
          An individual served with a subpoena duces tecum or deposition subpoena is normally given a reasonable time to respond.  A valid subpoena will provide, in accordance with the statute, a response date and location.
a.         For a subpoena duces tecum issued in a civil action, the records should be provided either within 15 days after the receipt of the subpoena, or within the time agreed upon by the party serving the subpoena and the custodian of records or witness.  (Evid. Code § 1560(b)(2) and (b)(3).)
b.         For a deposition subpoena issued in a civil action, the University has either 15 days after the service, or 20 days after issuance of the deposition subpoena, whichever date is later, in which to respond.  (Code Civ. Proc. § 2020.410(c).)
c.         For a subpoena duces tecum in a criminal action, the response must be provided five (5) days after receipt of the subpoena or within the time agreed upon by the party serving the subpoena and the custodian of records or witness.  (Evid. Code § 1560(b)(1) and (b)(3).)

Nice comment history you have there. Hard forking from bitcoin and attacking a leaderless, global system using lies and disinformation (bch)is a gamble. It’s not working. That’s why we have people like you here trying to change the narrative and confuse new users. You only have one life dude, and this is how your spending your time. We’ve already had bitcoin classic and bitcoin xt from roger and many of the same hostile bad actors. We’ve also had bitcoin segwit 2x. Bitcoin gold. Super bitcoin. Bitcoin diamond. And bitcoin zclassic which will be a hard fork later this month. Those were all gambles too. We know whose using bch, and it’s not anyone other than those within the bch camp. No one wants to associate themselves with that level of toxicity. As soon as you spend 5 minutes researching bch, you became nauseated.

Yeaup just added to my comment. Looks like they have been accepting it and I was wrong. Someone else just replied to me as well. But I’m seeing more and more articles talking about it today so I’m still pleased to know. I know today was the first I had heard about it. I’m gonna update my post too because I like discuss things truthfully. Still accepting bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:06:51
Yes, it will. Like gold. It’s already happening. It doesn’t need to be the only currency we use in the world. That’s part of the reason for the ambitious scaling solution (LN). Obviously I cannot guarantee it will be accepted globally, but I would give it maybe a 50-75% (pure speculation) chance in terms of long-term, global adoption. My opinion, and my hope. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 23:29:54
Whether they started yesterday, partially 3 years ago, whenever, doesn’t really matter much. They accept it and made a point to tweet about the new payment options today which includes bitcoin.

My opinion:
It’s fud. It’s part of massive coordinated effort by cnbc, bch, express, bitfinexxed. They want to suppress the price of bitcoin while causing mass war within the space. Bitfinexxed guy literally spends 15 hours a day spreading lies and disinformation. It is his full time job. He’s written 27 articles on tether in ~4 months, along with tens of thousands of tweets and responses. He’s retweeted constantly by bch trolls.

Why are you here trying to subtly manipulate people? 
You have countless  pro-bch, we need bigger blocks, the rest of you don’t know what you’re talking about comments in your history. 
Let ln be ln. Just leave it alone if you don’t like it. 
If ln is too difficult for the average user, then maybe they’ll use ltc or bch or digibyte or xmr or zcash or nem or omg
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:45:29
Lack of segwit adoption
Inconsistent communication and questionable launch of bch on the platform
Brian Armstrong publicly stating he does not like cores vision of scaling (he wanted to increase the block size and has publicly undermined core)
Lack of batch transfers, which causes particularly heavy strain on the network because of their transaction volume 
Exorbitantly high fees (for ease of use) : 4% for bank purchases, 5.5% for all credit cars purchases.
I’m not op but those are all fair points in my opinion. The brigading of coinbase at first seemed immature to me, but at this time it does feel somewhat warranted.
One could also make additional claims based on speculation, but the reasons listed above are almost entirely factual.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:32:01

I’ve had similar experience when transferring using segwit. About $7 in fee and transfer took 5-10 minutes to generate on the blockchain. Available on the new wallet within 20 minutes.

Yeah I agree. Bch works about as well as litecoin. When transferring / sending btc, litecoin, bch between wallets, litecoin is definitely the fastest and usually about the same price or cheaper than bch.  My experience. Lightning network will change all of that. Also, segwit transfers of Btc are significantly faster for me compared to non-segwit and the fees are about 50%.

In terms of posting the other comment I responded the same way when they used same comment again and the thread was being brigaded.
The article I posted was *updated on October 2017,  not written which is why I responded and told them I was incorrect. Still the first I’m hearing of it and as others mentioned they’re probably tweeting about this service (kind of) in their recent tweet to ride on the coattails of kfc. Or maybe not.

Okay. Yet it has the widest adoption of any other cryptocurrency, can be liquidated for fiat and people are selling heir homes and cars for bitcoin. It’s still accepted at Microsoft, Overstock, and several other outlets. Fees today are about $1-$2 - partially because of segwit adoption, partially because the mempool isn’t being spammed, partially because exchanges are beginning to batch their transactions, and partially because there’s less transactions currently in the queue. Lightning adoption is on its way. You can see how hungry the community is and how many lightning projects are already coming to life.
Yes, there is a coordinated attack to keep bitcoin suppressed as long as possible, which is why I give it a 50-75 percent chance of succeeding. If you’re unhappy with bitcoin and don’t believe it will succeed, then that’s fine. It’s a risk to invest. So is any cryptocurrency, or any stock or asset for that matter. All the best to you with whatever other currency you believe more in.

@_date: 2017-12-15 08:11:36
I agree. They seem much less concerned about the success of bitcoin and much more focused on supporting additional coins and creating a stock market 2.0 (CEO’s words). I fully support other coins and truly believe many will have a place in our societies future, however, bitcoin is what got us here and we can not suppress the network or it’s future simply because it is an inconvenience. Bitcoin’s scale cannot and should not be suppressed for the health of the entire crypto community. Yes, upgrades are cumbersome and consensus can be difficult to achieve, but that is because bitcoin is a decade-old, game-changing, global currency that has defied all odds and is literally the only reason we are all here discussing this today. It is also the reason coinbase exists. If anything, this situation should speak to the robust, powerful and democratic ideals that make up bitcoin. 
Sure, one could say - why do we even need bitcoin? Why not just switch over to another currency? There are many reasons to support a currency of the future beyond upgraded code, systems, technology, etc. If you need to ask yourself what makes bitcoin better than these other currencies, then I truly believe you do not fully understand what bitcoin is or what it represents, both as an idea and an ideal. Bitcoin’s price may go anywhere from $0 - $25mil, but I can almost guarantee you one thing: bitcoin will always be here. As long as there is electricity, and maybe even if not.
I for one would like to live in a world where I use bitcoin as my bank, while other coins may be used as various currencies that can acquire different goods, services, experiences - or used as ‘gas’ for  data tracking, energy sharing, digital staking, etc - and a whole host of other applications. 
I just don’t want to see any direct or deliberate sabotaging of bitcoin solely for the success of coinbase. They have so much influence now because their product is so beautifully presented and their ease of use is unmatched in my opinion. That is why you pay the 4%-5.5% fee to use their service, on top of the bitcoin network fees.
Bitcoin is us. Bitcoin is you. It will lead us into the future we all deserve. This is the world. Don’t let us down. Let’s all work together to make bitcoin the global the currency the world needs and deserves. Lighting network will take us there. Segwit is the beginning. Let’s work together. Please coinbase. Please Brian. Do the right thing.

I know that is the official story and it may very well be. As I mentioned it is speculation and mostly just for fun. Hal did have a neighbor whose name was Satoshi Nakomoto - who also had his home foreclosed on during the 2008 financial collapse. That is why I many here on this subreddit and elsewhere speculate that their could be more to the story than he is letting on.. but of course, yes, he could just simply be the first person to receive a transaction on the network as the official story is told. Either way, thank you, Hal.

Andreas is taking the high road. He knows speaking down to Roger will only hurt the cause. 
He chooses to not make outlandish comments like Roger does on twitter (I.e. ‘Andreas is a loser because he doesn’t own enough btc’)
He is choosing to lead by example. He is setting the stage for how those in the bitcoin community should treat each other. 
If your post history wasn’t littered with bch propaganda I would be more inclined to believe you truly care about bitcoin and what it represents. I think we all know bch is not bitcoin and won’t ever be. We have litecoin, raiblocks, and heck even eth and monero if the primary concern is to process transactions faster and pay lower fees. 
I’ll def enjoy the free bch / free btg / and the new, free segwit 2x coin we’ll be receiving on the 28th. 
One could argue any of those could also be bitcoin. I will take the dividends and support the original bitcoin. Not the one that removes segwit (strange how they did that, huh?) and is supported by jihan, roger ver and the miners. Bitcoin may have lost much of its decentralized nature, but it would be inaccurate to think bch does not significantly increase centralization. The pnd tactics, the bch troll campaign, roger ver being roger, the ‘plotting to take over btc’ Facebook post - they all make me sick to my stomach. I would have a hard time believing anyone who truly cares about the morals, ethics, goals and objectives of bitcoin are aligned with how the major bch players have plotted and manipulated the market and spread misinformation. You’re on the wrong side of things if you believe bch is bitcoin. Use whichever fee, satoshis vision, etc argument you have available.. it is a direct attack on the growing pains Btc is currently experiencing. We also all understand that for bitcoin to truly scale to the masses, (micro payments, micro transactions) L2 solutions such as LN will be required.

Mostly paid trolls funded by bch. You will learn in time. Roger and his team use a lot of manipulation techniques. They pay influencers on social media, Reddit, msm, etc to spread their narrative. It’s insulting and disingenuous, but we are stronger together as a community because of the attack. 
Here is one example:

We know what you’re up to and where your intentions lie. Will be an interesting week 
@_date: 2018-06-30 21:06:25
100% agree. This post helps. Thanks op. It’s becoming more and more obvious, regardless of the approach (concern trolling, pretending to support bitcoin and the community, etc)
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:28:35
Sounds like quite a coincidence. I think that’s sort of the point here. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 21:03:52
I respect you BashCo. You do a lot for the community. But this sub, and every crypto sub, has constant, manipulative marketers who spread their narrative and dissent. Bch 100% has paid trolls. There are many others who work for whales and other financial corporations / msm media outlets as well. It’s not you or the mods’ fault. You all do a great job in terms of doing your best and working to limit fud and troll brigading. But there is life (world) changing money and power at stake here and people and organizations will go to great lengths to get what they want (or feel they deserve). Thank you for your contributions. We appreciate it.

If you actually read the site, the whole premise is to advise people that speculative bubbles are real and to invest wisely and accordingly. The game has a 1/32 chance of resetting each time someone purchases it.
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:04:59
Very cool! Great to see the community releasing applications on ln
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:29:30
Why can’t it be both??
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:06:46
Why does it matter? Your post has a sense of arrogance to it.
Who cares? They can both provide the service. You can play solitaire or baccarat or whatever online already. They’re testing the network and if you like eth, play it on eth. If you like ln on btc, use Btc. Or use both. Lightning network is being implemented and supported by eth, btc, ltc, phore, vtc, lux, xlm, xmr and many others. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:00:54
This is awesome. Wow, bch trolls so petty with the white paper near the final portion of the video. Thanks for sharing 
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:23:18
Agreed. I love how people want to automatically dismiss the theory without taking the time to research or be open minded. I think the guy may be onto something. Its amazing to think about 
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:07:39
Exactly right.

The livestream ended as they were talking about bitcoin. Multiple people reporting it happening live. Video was unavailable via all browsers for several hours. Not trying to ‘push a conspiracy theory’ stating facts

Bots. YouTube removed the full podcast and ended the stream as Jack was discussing bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:10:21
After taxes he has like 350k.
New Tesla = 35k plus fees
 
That’s over 10%
I guess it could still be worth it. One can dream
@_date: 2018-11-02 06:02:30
Bitcoin has L2 and L3 in development. Eth dapps currently run on-chain which cause the network to perform poorly with heavy load. Bitcoin is hard money and will have dapp capabilities available with Lightning and other layer 2 solutions. Eth will figure it out eventually, too

I usually find it difficult to listen to a full podcast. Listened to this with 1.5x speed and loved it. Listened again yesterday to take more notes

He’s a troll.
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:58:53
Transactions dropping by half except btc has processed 207k tx in the last 24 hours.
Same as October/November of last year. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:23:55
Systemic shilling is quite obvious if you read between the lines. Not sure how anyone could not see that. In terms of what defines ‘systemic’ - I guess it can be loosely described in many ways.
The majority of the  manipulative posts and responses play off of community fear and emotions. Concern trolling is another major factor here. Look at bitfineexxed guy as one glaring example - read what he’s written about, how frequently he’s written about it, and who he is supported and retweeted by. It’s quite obvious he is paid for his work and who is reporting to another party. Bitfinexxed guy does not care about ‘us.’
There is most certainly institutional manipulation, along with massive shill armies from projects like bch and others. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 16:21:29
Hahah ah how is bch treating you?
So now we’re cherry picking the top lowest and highest tx day? 
You’re fine to do so. Have fun with that. 
Fees have become much cheaper and tx are arriving within minutes as opposed to hours because spam tx’s have stopped, and segwit adoption has increased from 13% to 30% in a few weeks. CB was the sea change that pushed many other exchanges to follow suit. More exchanges will adopt segwit and I predict around 45-50% segwit adoption by June 2018. 
In your recent comment - you also called bitcoin an ‘altcoin.’ Okay. Keep spinning things however you’d like. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:42:11
That is exactly it. And money, too. What a child. ‘I didn’t get my way so .. humph.’ 
Also think he was paid for this bitcoin.org login details as someone mentioned below.. Sad and disgraceful to say the least.
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:47:39
He’s a clown. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:35:51
LN coins are future.
Litecoin and vertcoin are silver / bronze. Other projects I can think of who plan to implement lightning:
xmr, phr, xsn, acn, xlm, lux
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:52:34
It works really well. Very impressed. You definitely receive at least a couple thousand extra sats as well when purchasing from square. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:45:07
That was amazing to watch. 11/10 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:10:27
This is a troll post (op, not you). Troll comments responding to him. Watch how they interact with each other. It’s a game for them. They want to make us afraid. Make us worried.

Truuu haha
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:25:32
Yeaup. They’re just trolling. The market is stabilizing so prepare for an influx of manipulation and disinformation. This subreddit takes the brunt of the the crypto manipulation. We gotta stay strong, not give them what they want. The troll attempt here is to get the community and users to disagree and present reasons as to why Btc won’t ever be a currency. Truth is, it is already currency. Literally accepted as legal tender in Japan. You can buy things with your bitcoin in almost every country. Troll troll troll.
Happy Saturday to you, though, burstup!
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:26:15
Great point.
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:12:57
He’s a troll. The actual original post is likely a troll too. Notice the language they use by calling out mike novagratz, mcafee, sinking ship etc. 
The new troll game is to create a new account (or buy one with a long history) and post a few newb comments. Then a few others, like the guy you’re responding to, come in and agree with the ‘newb’ which causes fear and uncertainty within the thread.
@_date: 2018-11-07 01:25:18
Nice that’s awesome
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:42:44
Spread misinformation with the help of msm, cnbc, internet trolls, bitcoin platforms and outlets. 
Attempt to blur the lines as to what is the real bitcoin and what it’s value should be.
Step on the public’s throat with constant fear and manipulation for days on end. Crash market as a result of that fear. 
Once crypto goes into a full bear market, it creates an opportunity to reinvent bitcoin and the crypto market in general. 
The only way to topple bitcoin is to destroy it first. That is why there is an attempt to do so. 
If you wouldn’t  have prefaced your post by propping up bitfinnexxed, we’d take you more seriously. Your response adds fuel to theory above. The community is learning how to recognize these forces and how they operate as a result. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:10:31
I agree with you. They’re not off the hook yet. Good points.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:14:53
Glad this topic is getting more recognition. I would estimate anywhere from 25%-75% of the posts and comments are simply manipulation stemming from bad actors who have specific intentions. Tether fud, Wall st manipulation, government regulation, bch buying off partners and media outlets, banks, etc. are all key factors. 
Some major shilling present form certain altcoin projects, as well
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:01:50
Agreed. Have to give them some props for at least getting it done now. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:31:08
He’s a troll. Per usual. Trying to manipulate the subreddit. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:38:55
The new troll game is to create a new account (or buy one with a long history) and post a few newb comments. Then a few others, like the guy you’re responding to, come in and agree with the ‘newb’ which causes fear and uncertainty within the thread. Notice how many times he’s replied to me since I stated my comment? And how defensive his comments are to me? I’m just here for bitcoin. Because I love it and believe in it. So I defend it. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:08:53
Go away troll. You’re not doing a very good job.

I’ll take it haha.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:37:34
Bitcoin has been processing just over 200k transactions over the last few weeks. Same as Oct/Nov of 2017. This does not include batched transactions and the recent rise in segwit adoption. Outputs are actually the correct measurement now. So Btc is likely transacting even more than 200k tx per day
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:45:38
I agree. I’m all with you here. Doing my part as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:43:19
You’re not even a good troll. Try being less sensationalist. How much do they pay you anyway? 
Ever heard of supply management? Or how about decentralized exchanges? Or how about banking the unbanked? Ever heard of decentralized identity? What about Microsoft creating their own decentralized identity platform using the Blockchain? Well, surely you’ve heard about that gm, vw and bmw all making very clear indications that they will be working with Blockchain partners for use in their vehicles? How about logistics? Food tracking? Ah right you’re just a clown spreading disinformation. If you want me to grab a few dozens links for you, let me know. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:41:10
Why so aggressive? Bitcoin was much cheaper in 2014 than it is today. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:27:08
Go away troll. No one likes you. How do you live with yourself knowing you spend your time causing fear and manipulation online? Just leave the community alone. The og’s will help educate the newbs. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:32:47
He’s just a sad troll. Trying to get us to doubt our ‘hodl’ position. This has been the new troll theme over the last few days since tether fud is no longer an option.
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:33:07
Hey man, sorry bch isn’t working out for you. Come join the revolution. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:43:33
Yeah, notice how aggressive his comment was? Cheers. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:59:30
I’m a fan, too. Plus no fees. Win.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:48:07
Okay, Dooglus. Enjoy your constant subtle troll campaign of telling everyone one why lower fees, Lightning network and segwit are all a waste of time. Spin it how you’d like.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:17:58
He’s trolling.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:08:21
He has -69 total karma. He’s part of the massive fud campaign. He’s paid to do this. Troll life. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 21:21:26
Roger Ver owns a stake in the company and they intentionally mislead the public to support his narrative. They use misinformation, outrageous and inaccurate tx fees and shady marketing to promote their interests. Avoid them. Much better alternatives depending on your location. Congratulations to OP for joining the revolution. Welcome to the community. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:37:23
Do we have to link all of the bitcoindotcom articles, tweets, Reddit posts and messaging in preparation for the account or will you just admit that it was funded by them?
The issue is that we have people promoting it as if there is no involvement. Roger often incites libertarian views in an effort to fuel his bch agenda. His primary goal in most of his messaging is to stir controversy within communities by forcing you to choose a side. He is a master manipulator and founded stbitts.com - which is the marketing agency used to manipulate Reddit, fb, twitter, crypto media, msm etc. 
I think you know this.
@_date: 2018-02-25 19:48:25
Summarized well here. Links included
 
Plus we have significantly less spam transactions happening. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:10:54
Calling bitcoin - ‘bitcoin core’ - with poop emojis has a very clear intent. If you continue to troll, we’ll have more evidence that this guy is trying to manipulate the community. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:54:08
... and there wasn’t a multi million dollar fundraiser, either 
For those that know. All love. Bitcoin / LN ftw!!
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:12:15
Why did you call btc - bitcoin core with poop emojis recently? Don’t lie to the community. You’re not a good person if you’re manipulating the public. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:43:31
You’re right. I just checked and it’s about $150 difference. I compared the amount of Btc you would receive between a $100 purchase between each site. Square was incrementally better. About 30k sats or so
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:56:41
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:45:58
You tried.
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:18:49
Roger Ver and Bch marketing. Sad.
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:07:27
Suspicious to say the least. Time will tell where your interests lie. No one beyond the bch community uses the term ‘bitcoin core’ to describe bitcoin. We’re watching 
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:32:56
He’s a troll. They’re everywhere. Trying to make the community worried about their investment. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:33:54
Wow. Thanks for the link 
‘That’s why I’m all in on bch’
   
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:18:29
He is a bch shill manipulating the community. He referenced bitcoin as ‘bitcoin core’ with poop emojis a few weeks ago. His narrative will change and he will slowly try to dismiss LN w his posts. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:13:26
Seems to be the case. Fcking scammers will do anything for an agenda
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:45:22
100% agree.
And let’s not boast or brag. Let’s take this as a small win and focus on adoption, inclusion and education.
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:33:34
Yes I know, we should laugh. And I almost write that at the end of reply. All in good fun. Just pointing out the other side of things, too. We only have so much time and energy available per day to focus on things. Cheers
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:23:10
Let them have this posted. They want bitcoin supporters to react. This is one of Rogers tools. Emotion. Fear.
He gets the community upset with his outlandish claims and manipulative demeanor and business practices. He has money and power and is going to do what he wants to do.
Focus on bitcoin adoption and making it the best it can be. Try not to react with anger and frustration. Be one step ahead. This is the game Roger, his paid trolls, the bch miners, CNBC, bitpay, Vinny Ligham - they will play. This is what they want. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:32:00
There’s a lot going on with bitcoin. Lightning network, segwit, lapps, schnorr signatures, atomic swaps, new hw mining companies, new community applications, and a more resilient user base with each correction to name a few
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:38:00
I am a bitcoin supporter. But we don’t really need this. Let’s focus on better things, eh? Roger is lame for promoting bch, but let him focus on what he wants to focus on. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:52:04
With his argument, the scammers trying to take crypto on twitter would also be entitled to their version of ‘free speech.’  
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:46:29
Hahaha edited already - supposed to say Roger
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:45:36
I agree this is the most likely scenario. Roger and his team think it’s okay because it’s a free market. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:35:03
