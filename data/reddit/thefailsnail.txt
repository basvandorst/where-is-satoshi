It's because the majority of the people that use Coinbase do not know about this. It's dubbed THE app to use when you're starting with bitcoin for a lot of people. Also, they are the only one with a nice looking app which makes it easy for people to get into bitcoin trading.

What is the alternative and has an easy way to transfer the coins I have in Coinbase to this alternative?

I have a question:
If it's this "easy" to manipulate the marketprice of BTC, how will it ever become a stable entity? Will BTC ever be a generally accepted form of currency if it can be manipulated to tank or take-off at will?

Probably a dumb question, but how can you see the sell walls that are being put up?

Why probably towards the 18th?

How does a line like this make you think he's upset?
Anyway... in the example you give where you show the user balance of BTC, you should probably also show the disposable income that user has, just to put into context how much that 0.007 is really compared to the 4.7.

The most realistic price I don't know. The ideal price would be 1BTC = 1BTC, since then it's used as valuta and people are buying and selling in BTC.

So... now? Buy now?

It's unclear. I think a large factor will be how fast the development of Quantum computers will be. It's already faster than anticipated, but Bitcoin should prepare itself for when a Quantum computer is created that can break Bitcoin. If it doesn't, it becomes worthless, else it might stand a chance to get to whatever number.

The first replies just confirm what the OP wrote.
There is no indication that Bitcoin will or won't become bigger than it currently is. Yes, more people know what bitcoin is, but that doesn't mean anything. I know what a lot of things are, but that doesn't mean I want to own or use them. Sure, more companies might accept bitcoin, but the majority of people that are currently here are not using bitcoin to pay for things, they're here in the hopes of becoming richer. Like the OP says, gamblers.

But if the goal isn't to use it as a daily currency.... then what is the use of Bitcoin? If you can't convert it into 'money', then why would you keep it. Gold was used as money back when money became hip. Silver and Gold were used as payment in the bible even. It used to be money. Bitcoin hasn't been money yet.

"can be" is the keyword. It's basicly what I said... they should prepare themselves on time.. if they don't, it's gone.

Entire company or just a car? J/k

I won't have a lambo, because my investment was done with money I could affort to lose. I might get some profit in the end, but it won't be lambo-sized profits :P

..... who cares? Does it matter if he buys .01 or 10.0 as long as it's all he can afford?

He's just catering to the general public. Half of the Netherlands have heared of the Bitcoin as a get rich quick thing. These people also heared that the market collapsed. They know what he means when he makes the parallel.

Even broken clocks are right twice a day.. This is basicly how I feel about the daily shouting where people predict bears or bulls. Sure, they might be right occasionally..

You must have missed the newsmessage where they mentioned that people that invested in crypto in the Netherlands alone went up from 130k to 500k last year. If 500k people invested in it, it's safe to say that a much bigger group in the Netherlands has heared of it. Enough at least, for commentators to make a joke about it and not everyone going "what is he talking about".
Or maybe you and me just hang out with different people...

For someone that doesn't know crypto very well you should probably go with analogy they understand. I would compare it with a classic car. Classic cars are limited because they are not produced anymore. You can start to produce a car and name it the same, but it wont be the same car nor have the same value. It is a car (crypto) but its not the classic (bitcoin).
