This has been my realization as well. Looking at the 50 and 200 day MA, the current pattern is near identical to 2014. I started to play around with this theory in February, and the longer it plays out the more similar the pattern becomes. Assuming that it follows the 2014-16 bear market pattern, btc might go as low as mid $3k before both the 50 and 200 day MA flatten and align, signaling the next fractal expansion of btc. 
So sometime in 2020-2021 we’d be approaching the ATH, then have another epic run to $100,000+ levels. 
I still hold out hope we can break the downtrend this year, but especially considering that after consensus and tax season ending, that the markets are still bearish, I’m finding that scenario less and less likely. 
It might be good actually though because during this time, the best projects will survive while the crap ones will die or fade into obscurity. If you get lucky with the right alts, you may still be able to make serious gains though. Others will just die in a bath of blood.

If you buy it when the price is under the 200MA and HODL for a few years, you are making a very statistically favorable bet that it will go up. If you buy it when the price is 3x+ the 200MA, you have bought the top of a bubble and will take a loss if you sell it short term. 
I don't get all the freaking out over price though. This has been the status quo of bitcoin since its inception. What is so different now than previous cycles? Is it because too many people invested money they can't afford to lose? 
If you believe in the technology then don't fret. Crypto will still be around, and even if hyper bitcoinization doesn't happen in the next decade, crypto will still be there to battle financial censorship, banking exclusion, currency debasement, and totalitarian autocracies.

Reminder, every attack on bitcoin is an attempt to shake out weak hands.

I really love the pyramid scheme it implements.
