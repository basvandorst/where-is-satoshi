Elon Musk does not require permission directly by the FCC, but is required to by the International Telecommunications Union, to ensure interference with other satellites in orbit does not occur. The ITU only accepts those who have already filed through a national regulator like the FCC. This could be done in England, for example, and he would still bound to the same regulations (ITU).

Mhm.. Idk. Maybe the fact that he put a hit on 6 other fellow men?

Oh sweetie.. He's been charged separately by Maryland.

Serious question, who would build the roads?

Oh trust me, he knows where those funds are going. You'll be a fool to assume he isn't getting a slice of it himself.

Please stop talking out of your ass. Governments had control over their currency, paper money or gold, by controlling their mintage.
edit: [Also you may want to read up on what a national currency actually is.](

No, it does not make them "technically" admiralty courts. That's just you being foolish.

It is also impossible to give a $0.0000034570 fiat tip in real life. Bitcoin wins again!

"stop voting?" 
.. What in the hell? This is a democracy you dipshit, if you do not like the people whom represent you, you have the choice to vote them out or run for the position yourself. As much as it may shock you, this slackavism, ie posting brave comments on reddit isn't going to change anything.

I take it ModernDemagogue meant Bill of Rights when he said Constitutional protections, in which case, he would be correct. The Bill of Rights limits federal powers, though with some applying to states as well, and no where would it apply to a corporation.
