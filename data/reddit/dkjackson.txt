Make sure to change your password and secret question.  Choose a completely new password and nonsense secret question so that next time when Bitcointalk gets hacked no one has potential access to any other internet accounts you may have with the same or similar credentials.

I mine most of the coins I sell.  I do not want to sell coins on the open market, I want to sell coins to new users.  The miners that are selling coins on the market to pay power are the idiots that are keeping the price of bitcoin low.

This would be a lot funnier if their ETF was live.  Maybe they should stop trying to be clever and get the fucking ETF live.

Here is one.  We have them at 3 of the gold stores.

Every week I am beating my sales on my Bitcoin ATM's.  I sold over 10 coins yesterday.  It is going crazy.

I am just trying to get more people involved in Bitcoin.  I am not trying to get rich off of Bitcoin ATM's.

Is this real?  It looks so scammy.  The address is a house.  The feedback is ridiculous.  They claim to have 28 employee's???  For what?  There are like 10 red flags on this site.
The site is also identical to this scam site which is ripping people off right now.
Conclusion:  THIS IS A SCAM!

I have talked to many people that buy the coins.  The majority of them are very excited about Bitcoin and just want to own a few.

I sold 7 coins today via ATM's.  I am averaging over 5 coins a day now. My best day was 20 coins.  People buy more coins on mondays.  Older women buy bitcoins like crazy.

I have camera's recording every transaction and the employees watch the ATM's and tell me who is using them.

This is why you park money in your bank account 3 months before you buy a house.  Then the money is "seasoned" and they don't question it.

Is this real or a scam?  It looks very scammy.

Go to a bitcoin ATM.  Where are you?

The quality of the Bitcoin logo is too dense as well.  Look at the other logos.  They are low quality to load fast, but they have one logo that is high quality?  Why?

Anyone tried this yet?  is this confirmed?
