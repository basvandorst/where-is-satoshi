@_date: 2018-05-29 15:35:26
Volume hardly moved ha 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:30:08
He has but I think timing of it is crucial he does it as its geting towards a big mental hurdle that 10000 Mark. Gives inexperienced traders the jitters maybe. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:53:03
Sick of seeing 9000 now time to jus fucking fall to nothing or rise back to ath
@_date: 2018-08-23 08:20:21
I think they are confused too ha
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:56:41
My guess is an island if he had the knowledge to mine bitcoin at the start of it all surely he has made alot of money 
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:01:17

@_date: 2018-05-18 16:01:37

How we know will be rejected? 
@_date: 2018-05-12 12:08:25
Sorry what fomo stand for? 
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:05:41
I'd probably say it's because they wanted to see some profit and know that they can buy back in when price drops like it did. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:23:46
Hard to see it dumping again with consensus on at minute? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:16:19
Doesn't mean to say an upside down one won't follow! 
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:24:14
8600 seems to be holding at minete like a warrior hopefully it carries on
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:39:47

Ha oops sorry. Why has it dumped now let me guess someone dropped a pin in Bulgaria? 
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:17:02
Yes because it was Bank Holiday weekend
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:25:46
Probably a number of things that with upbit news and big mouth buffet too. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:38:29
I get you, etf buying real bitcoin at least you own the bitcoin then rather than a contract on the price of bitcoin which means more risk. Is that correct? 
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:35:49
Tmorrow I think
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:29:05
To a certain extent they do at the minute yes but thats not what am trying to say no. Am saying trading volume isn't as high over bank holiday weekends. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 06:47:00
Ha good find! 
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:30:49
What the fuck is bitcoin pizza day
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:12:18
Famous last words
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:45:02
In my opinion do it now while your young and free because when you get older and have a family and bills you may not have freedom to do it 
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:36:31
Sounds like something off back to the future! 
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:36:17
Asians are killing crypto at min seems to drop 2 or 300 usd each night for past week 
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:18:40
Is this actually true? 
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:48:18
Yes but if you buy a pizza for 10k how many pizzas did he have for 10k. Or would u stop at buying a pizza and think ill save the rest untill it hits 20000 a coin lol I think not. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:02:21
He said safer than rail and if Warren can have opinions so can we
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:35:48
Ha depression sets in. Everyone starts arguing with there Mrs because price is crashing and she burning ye head out while your watching the vertical drop keep dropping. Then you get turfed out for telling her to fuck off for distracting you and you go down the pub to forget. Possible reason? 
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:53:36
Ha ha what if one of the guppys is skint and doesn't get paid till end of the month again. Should he find a safe place to hide and put a helmet on waiting for reserves to come?

@_date: 2018-06-10 18:08:39
Cheers guys nice knowing yas, off to jump in front of a train

@_date: 2019-08-22 06:35:36
Do you think crypto is a good place to put money, or better in precious metal or mining? Gold has already shot to 1500 usd an oz. Feel like it's last all time high isn't to far away and risky jumping in now! Or do u think will go much higher this time?
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:47:38
Yes just wait for young Bart Simpson to form
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:13:55

@_date: 2018-06-06 12:53:55
Yes also true
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:03:02
So does this only help bitcoin or does it also benefit alt coins? 
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:19:33
Ha same man, the human mind is difficult to adapt to new ways. I have had similar situations
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:31:28

@_date: 2018-03-14 16:42:37
Why is that and when will it come back in 
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:31:50
So is the market where its at now without any institutional money? And if so why would anyone put it in if they know its a bubble that will pop? 
@_date: 2018-11-03 02:18:18
Have they not got enough money? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:07:43
So does that mean it hasn't got a clear cut use at the minute. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:15:59
No y
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:32:53
George is eating through buy walls
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:59:40
But when it goes there is no where else that goes like it. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 02:44:17
I'm no religious or Saint but to see people suffer when they don't need to is a joke
@_date: 2018-03-15 10:06:08
Up hopefully for fuck sake if bitcoin where human it would of hung itself along time ago with all the shit it gets. Who new people hated new technology so much. Small minded people
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:20:12
Volume has stayed higher throughout today too, it has only dropped back a little. Could be looking good to start move towards 5000
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:00:01
Good luck
@_date: 2018-03-21 06:28:47

@_date: 2018-11-16 11:14:17
Who's brian
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:29:11

@_date: 2018-02-01 17:29:46
Keep em coming! 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:18:13
Ha the lesson is Never Sleep period! 
@_date: 2018-03-17 15:03:44
Gold is a safe haven when dow goes under or stocks. So possibly bitcoin may become safe haven if that was to happen. Not all doom and gloom
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:28:00
Any other recommended avenues of cashing out ? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:12:36
Think 8600 or 9 k
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:11:27
Anyone know what time meeting is at?
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:17:13

@_date: 2018-03-16 14:54:03
What is resistance 8600?
@_date: 2018-03-05 08:24:20
Ah good luck partner. 4 years must of been a long fun but stressful journey ha. I do agree with previous comment though hold a bit back. Cash out 80 percent. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 08:22:40
Tomorrow do they close? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 16:44:00
Ha good points the 4th being the main one 
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:04:13
Is payza a good way to cash out ?
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:49:33
Yes agree but where is price reversal ha
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:09:46
This isn't a bear market yet just a dragged out correction. Look at bigger picture. Zoom out! 
@_date: 2018-03-28 06:11:25

There's always tomorrow. That's the good thing about crypto ye never know what it will bring 
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:38:08
Why are we dropping again there is no major bad news 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:41:22
Yes true I agree to be honest just saying 8600 because usually what I say it does the opposite ha. Got a mind of its own this bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:11:11
Explain please 
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:18:32
When your a holder none of this matters. Only the weak day traders who panic. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:21:53
Try 8600
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:28:36
So if people are moving in why is price dropping don't understand. There is so much shit out there saying one thing and saying another 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:45:00
Is there even going to be a bottom or is it just on a runaway train to 0
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:54:30
Who's winning here? Is it the bears struggling to break down or the bulls struggling to break up? 
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:16:35
The trap has slammed hard on them mice scratching round for bits of cheese
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:40:05

@_date: 2018-03-12 20:28:38

@_date: 2018-03-17 16:09:04
Back to the stone age then yeh
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:03:38
Why did price hit 9k then drop again is downtrend continuing or are we just revving up to fly past 9k.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:35:51
When will this nightmare be over need a good rebound soon
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:15:10
Is this the part where 9k holds and we jump back to 10k
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:22:02
I mean to the whole crypto market not just bitcoin
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:45:19

@_date: 2018-03-28 11:10:00
Oh dear. Another day of it. I think I'll crack open a can 
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:37:20
So the big investors wait for regulation before they pour in. When is g20 meeting will that have effect of prices do you think? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:45:47
Anyone know what this little increase is in aid of. Is it another neus for people to hang themselves with ha
@_date: 2018-03-21 06:35:09
What sort of news. Because it took g20 news to turn us back in upward movement
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:47:21
Don't tell my wife or there will be a falling knife��
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:27:32
What happens to gold when Dow goes
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:19:32
False statement 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:53:15
Told you patience pays in life
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:48:59
Ha yes probably, seems like everything is 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:59:21
@_date: 2018-03-28 10:29:09
Good because am getting bored of this range now. 8200 to 7900 to 8100 to 7900. Need a new range I like 12000 to 14000 that will make me smile. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:40:57
It was a question but sort of a plea
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:21:32
Oh right I see so they give u cash then u transfer the bits 
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:14:25
Hopefully 9k will hold and start to recover
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:46:35
No way this goes past 5k surely no way 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:14:46

Seducing? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:29:53

@_date: 2018-02-07 00:32:28
Ha good speech but corrupt as fuck like the rest of the big wigs. He's hodling definitely through family members.
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:16:06
You could of reinvested that rather than buying a wallet, who even has a wallet now days? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:37:50
Everything in crypto is
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:42:22
I feel an upwards move too but just read a very bearish article saying needs to find a Bottom am sure we have hit 5600 to 5800 3 times now and bounced that surely should be bottom for me 
@_date: 2018-07-16 08:46:48
Agree but where is the public privacy? 
@_date: 2019-09-20 06:46:06
Right I see thanks for clearing this up.
@_date: 2018-07-16 11:08:16
Surely if they start geting paid in crypto they will get around it could be good for crypto
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:57:15
Why u mean sell off then if the wallet been activated? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:12:59
Gold and silver books always good, I also liked the richest man in babylon 
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:28:27
Just put my helmet on and siting tight ready for shit storm but you know what comes after a hefty storm. Some sunshine! 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:37:57
Sorry last time I checked bitcoin it was nearly 7 billion checked before and 15 billion? When this happen? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:09:18
Yes I agree then. There is that much rubbish out there it is easy to get side tracked with it all and forget about what it is you should really be concentrating on
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:35:38
Halved? It jumped up massive! 
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:06:40
That's bullshit mate or they would of just said no already rather than delaying till september
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:28:50
Just an observation but over the past 24 hours I have seen 4 of these posts on reddit, 1 claiming they pumped 50 billon, 1 saying 75 billion, 1 saying 100 billion now this 1 saying 128 billion, anyone know which 1 is correct?
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:49:11
If so good there only weak day traders. Who will make a loss. The price won't drop to anywhere near 6000 again so I am holding 
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:33:44
What just happened to volume? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:40:02
Must be mistake surely
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:09:34
Oh right I see, thanks for clearing that up 
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:45:30
Don't let these government fools over run us, they are trying there best to keep it down, 1 etf means nothing loads have been submitted 
@_date: 2018-07-18 09:40:06
What time meetings today can u watch live 
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:43:23
I think over the weekend we will see a move towards 9000.
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:52:35
Let's not forget bitcoin does most of its gaining within 11 days of each year, there is still alot of days in this year so it could average itself out 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:03:41
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:19:00
What you mean directly to cash ?
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:02:17
Uve lost me? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:02:26
Ha a it harsh but I like it 
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:49:50

@_date: 2018-07-25 10:30:38
Yes it does, that's y my strategy is buy to hold. Obviously everyone different 
@_date: 2018-04-04 21:57:18
I hope the 6600 will stand firm again
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:25:25
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:51:40
What? 
@_date: 2018-07-25 10:16:27
No I wouldn't! 
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:17:38
Pump and dumps have killed the crypto space these last 3 to 4 months
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:15:38
Thanks still learning here
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:17:25
Based on what
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:33:20
Very bad advise losses can exceed deposits
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:25:37
Why would bank close your account? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:16:38
I am guessing here but nothing! 
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:54:00
Country? 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:07:17
If not at least we get to see macafee eat his dick
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:50:36
Not much couple hundred dollars
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:06:29
What to buy or to withdraw into bank
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:47:56
Seems to be the light vs the dark side at the minute 
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:07:58
What price will it retest? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:28:24
Andddddd where back at 6660
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:42:57
I understand that I'm just trying to get a grip on how people predict a movement based on what? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:55:21
Nice how long you think before these are distributed round other countries? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:23:24
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:07:57
There is a blast off on its way!!! 
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:06:07

Winklevos 
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:13:43
? 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:55:40
@_date: 2018-04-11 11:20:17
When did this start happening. I use all time never happened to me 
@_date: 2018-04-16 06:02:16
Also dangerous. I'm a hodler. I'm in profit at the minete been hodling since September. I'm in no rush to sell. I just think the bear news has died down, the chart pattern is similar to previous years. And the price has held strong above 6600 for a while now. Just my opinions of course. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:37:28
No you are reason why! 
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:05:56
Why does big jump make you nervous ha this is crypto! 
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:09:39
Up! 
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:32:01
It doesn't seem to be budging past 6600 I wish something would happen up or down ha 
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:52:56
Does anyone know when they will introduce fiat pairs? 
@_date: 2018-04-20 23:07:29
Try payza, kraken or even gatehub
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:20:45
Hence macafee prediction ha! 
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:30:58
Ha ha brilliant will there be room for me too
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:36:35
Don't know man but am getting sick of these shorting fuckers
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:06:33
Buy! 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:01:12
How you know sorry just curious
@_date: 2018-04-15 07:57:27
It's like speaking to a wall. No 1 cares who I speak to. It's like there to busy in life to see what's happening. That's why governments get away with shit because people are to busy in life to give a shit! 
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:06:48
Ha I think so. I think so
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:26:44
Being a long term roller-coaster rider. What you view on recovery for rest of 2018? 
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:07:35
This is like a car hitting a wall at 100mph!
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:56:43
I wouldn't think about when the spike is I'd just make sure your comfortable with holding if it was to drop for another 18 months, I'd also think about what you want out of investing in 4 bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:43:58
What bank am in UK too
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:36:38
Make that 8250!
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:09:02
More like a bump the a fall off a mountain!
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:46:26
Ha same, hoping to get a new sofa end of this bull run!
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:29:03
To soon guys!
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:46:39
Tell her u sold everything see if she messages again
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:03:13
Plenty of scam coins
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:41:30
Then get ye money in there ha!
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:59:57
I know what ur saying regarding the pattern but there's nothing to say it has to follow the pattern surely. I mean new investors enter the market all the time and fomo may be higher than ever this time round!
@_date: 2019-05-19 09:30:48
Does anyone think this bull market will see price rises being much quicker and larger than the bull run of 16/17? Possibly resulting in it lasting for a smaller time period?
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:52:57
@_date: 2019-05-07 09:39:09
Don't be gready that's how u end up losing everything!
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:16:11
I hope it works for you, I'm basing it on past experiences! 
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:28:45
2 soon guys!
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:40:38
It will eventually change over time, they won't be around forever 
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:32:44
Sorry in experienced here, why is this happening?
@_date: 2019-05-10 06:47:34
Give it time! I hope!
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:12:56
I think where less than a month away before we start climb back to 6000 and 10000 usd!
