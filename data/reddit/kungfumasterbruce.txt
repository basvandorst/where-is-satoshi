Why stop there? Just say one billion.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:24:49
Oh yes you will.  Tomorrow will be so much cheaper.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:24:39
No worries.  Just hold and enjoy the ride.  If you can time the market, more power to you.  I have been horrible timing the market.
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:19:21
I know I am buying as much as I can.  I think bitcoin is still cheap.
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:34:50
All in.  Risk it for the biscuit.
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:35:04
Happy Birthday.  May your wish come true.
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:04:36
You are living paycheck to paycheck, but managed to by bitcoin by the thousands in the last 3 years.  Oh, did I ever mentioned I found 250 bitcoins on my old harddrive.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:45:28
Should of hold those beauties.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:53:31
Return of the king.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:20:27
Not sure it will go that low since we have been in consolidating for the pass 8 days.  I think we will continue to move up toward 8.5k.
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:57:20
He has in the stock market, but not the bitcoin market.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:16:15
Bad move.  Bitcoin have been consolidating for 8 days.  You will buy back higher due to fomo.
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:55:58
One full bitcoin is accomplishment in itself.  Just add a little every week and you might get 2.
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:49:23
Dude, you need to get your story straight.  First you mention last 3 years which makes it 2016.  Now it's 2013 and later today, I am you will say 2010.  I can see why you live paycheck to paycheck.
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:53:44
Good god.  Peeps needs to grow up.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:26:56
Because you need to convert it to satoshi.
@_date: 2019-06-04 20:47:02
I hope bitcoin is on sale when my funds clear.
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:50:55
Is your goal to attain more bitcoin or stop at where your at?
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:18:18
She is doing you a favor by leaving you now.  Imagine if you married her, you would of lost half of everything.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:33:00
Everyone will be trying to short bitcoin tomorrow as expected due to 8.1k range.  Have to do the opposite to be successful.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:39:44
Same here.  Waiting for funds to clear.
@_date: 2019-06-10 12:38:23
Bull run everyday.  Trend is up.
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:39:49
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:17:10
I am a little confuse here.  If the market is crashing, I thought bitcoin was the hedge bet.  Shouldn't bitcoin be up?
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:51:12
This happened in less than min, where the other one is 4 days.
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:11:20
Getting close.
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:33:34
Thank for the explanation.
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:17:07
I agree with you assessment.  This is play money for the wife and I.  The house, car, student loan are all paid off.  We already maxed our 401k, roth and 529.  I just want more money so I can experience more things in life.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:52:29
I lost money on my other stock investment like Tesla.
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:09:35
Maybe. My house is paid off and I have no debt what so ever.  I figured this is play money and I wanted more experience in life that requires more money.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:43:09
I put down 50k  two weeks ago on bitcon.  My wife was not happy  and made me sleep in a separate room.  I told her to trust my feeling even though I lost 10k on weedstocks.
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:23:38
Nice.  I need to follow your game plan :-).
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:50:31
At least 15 months or hit my price target of $250k per bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:20:54
Its2 down 250 pre market.
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:14:36
I thought throwing 50k on bitcoin required some balls.  I guess I need earn my other balls.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:20:38
If you look at the first bitcon bull market.  Bitcon went .01 to $1200.  The second bull market, bitcon went to 400 to 20k.  I estimate the next bull run to be close to 20x. So 5k x 20 equals 100k.  I expect fomo to kick in and bring bitcon close to 200k.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:04:04
Hold it at least a year and then collect your reward.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:49:03
Not yet.  I think I might be even.  She is afraid of choices because I am always all in or nothing.  I told if i ever want to be rich, you have to risk it for the biscuit.
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:55:06
I hope we all can win, it's more fun with bitcoin community.
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:24:52
I was told bitcoin was digital gold.  Gold is normally a hedge for market crash.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:55:08
Not really.  It's at 7300, but I have faith to hold it for 15 months.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:11:52
A wet dream
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:39:06
Why would someone dump thousands of bitcoin at 11:20 pm at night?  If his goal is create panic, it's sure did work for me.
