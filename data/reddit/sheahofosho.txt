Hindsight is 20/20. I cashed out half at 15.1k and thrilled. This dip will even itself out and give u another chance to sell back around 16k I would guess. Just wait it out 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:02:31
Panic sell now

Glad the wife talked me into cashing out some at 15.1k
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:14:57
I bought in back when it was under $800. I can’t justify paying these rates to get more BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-09 05:49:52
I’m thinking of cashing out my 1.2 BTC that are on a paper wallet. I was going to import using blockchain info and then send to my coinbase account, then convert to USD and withdraw. What kind of fees and lag time can I expect??
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:58:42
Thank u for this. How long does sweeping take usually?

@_date: 2017-12-24 19:57:02
What are u referring to?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:24:38
Is this different than having just lots of transactions in a paper wallet?  I have a paper wallet with a decent sum on there. Every time I bought on coinbase I sent it to the paper wallet and it has like 12 deposits into it
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:08:41
You’re out. Why do you care?  Say bye and leave
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:34:34
Don’t do it. It’s straight up gambling 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:22:43
Is there some online calc u can use to determine the size?  I have a paper wallet and I deposited BTC into it like 10 times from coinbase and I’m worried the fees will fuck me
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:13:48
What’s a large amount?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:20:33

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:35:12
How much is large?  I suppose this is a forced HODL. I thought I was doing the right thing by transferring my BTC out of coinbase each time I got more. Didn’t know I was screwing myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:49:46

@_date: 2017-12-10 19:02:28

@_date: 2017-12-30 23:16:29
May do that. I want to lock in a gain. Haven’t decided on how much to sell
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:00:46
Where are u coming up with these figures?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:03:36
Thank you for that incredible response. I’ll have to study it. Right now my BTC is in cold storage on a paper wallet I created back in 2014.  Can I ask you one more question?  The conventional wisdom is to not keep any BTC in an exchange. But whenever you move it off the exchange to another wallet you rack up fees. I use coinbase to buy BTC and then transfer to my paper wallet. What should I be doing?  I’m damned either way. Keep it on the exchange and risk they go bankrupt?  Or transfer it off the exchange and get fucked by fees?
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:58:00
Can u point me on info re: how to do that?  I’m thinking about cashing out 1BtC. Would would the coinbase fee be approx?
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:11:01

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:18:56
Glad I didn’t sell any of my forked coins. The total value of all my crypto hasn’t really moved much even though BTC is dropping hard 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:11:24
Where would I be inputting the fee I’m willing to pay?  Would that be as I’m converting to USD in coinbase?  Or going from blockchain info to coinbase? Or both? I appreciate any insight you can provide. I started with bitcoin about 3 years ago but never got too comfortable with how to actually transact. I just put it in cold storage and forgot about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:35:35
By simply importing to a new wallet I would then have just one input?  Also by just importing, aren’t I risking my security given that I’ve exposed the private key to the internet?

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:09:57
Wouldn’t that just mean the transaction size is bigger tho?  Not that each  transfer into the wallet is subject to its own unique fee?

@_date: 2017-12-09 18:58:53
Does the fee vary depending on how much you wish to take out. Considering cashing out half a bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:23:51
My buddy did that with stocks and lost $40,000 within two months. Go for it though.

Thank you again. This is great advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:08:41
I may not have the stomach to HODL much longer. If I just sold thru coinbase what would the fee be?  Not sure I want to complicate things by going thru gdax
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:35
If you try to day trade with it I guarantee you’ll lose it all. My advice is to not invest more than you can afford to lose and then forget about it for 10 to 15 years

Paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:23:28
Can the funds be sent from one paper wallet directly to another?  Or do I have to sweep it to a hot wallet and the.n send to the paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:10:23
How big was the transaction? Wow $1800 really?
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:37:51
I swept using Coinomi, then sent to coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:09:26
Do u consolidate just by sending the whole balance to another paper wallet when fees are low?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:22:40
I figured out a diff way. I was able to click on the pending transaction in coinbase and it took me to the blockcypher transaction page

Why free myself from the banking cartel just to become a prisoner of bitcoiners who apparently have no faith in their own movement?  A drop of 70% since I bought it is no small matter.  Bitcoin is the Blockbuster Video of currency.

I shouldn't have said I "knew." I can see a trend and I've learned the hard lesson that sometimes it's best to not stand on the tracks when a train is racing towards you.  Putting your arms out in front of you and insisting that the train will not hurt you is always a losing proposition.

A loss of 51.27% is not the "best investment" I've ever made.  'Fraid not, buddy

I wish I shared your optimism.  This thing that's supposedly "revolutionary" has been completely stalled for almost a year now.  I thought I was getting on the gravy train here but the train hasn't even left the station.  Bitcoin will never be widely adopted as a currency if its price wildly fluctuates... and face it, the only reason you own any bitcoin is because the price fluctuates and you anticipate/hope that the price will rise.

Bitcoin noob here.  Erik,I'll be honest.  I don't know who you are (again, because I'm new), but everyone one reddit seems to know who you are, so please excuse the potential ignorance of my question.  You claiming to have 150 million bitcoins would mean that you are, by far, the richest person on earth-- even after the recent sharp price drops of the past month.  If you had 150 million bitcoins at their price in early January, that would mean the value of your bitcoin exceeds $120 billion dollars; almost as much as Bill Gates and Carlos Slim combined.  Even at their current shitty rate, the bitcoins you have exceed 75 billion in value.  Is this the claim you are making? Or have I misunderstood something here?
@_date: 2014-06-24 21:11:53
It's 1/2 over.  Bitcoin is &lt;$600.  If you think it'll even touch, for an instant, above $700 in 2014, I would disagree

Edit: You people are ridiculous.  Bitcoin is up over 5,000% since inception, and you still think you got in on the ground floor when you bought your first BTC at $600???  Stop kidding yourselves.  I have given up and so should you.  Regardless of whether Bitcoin is viable in the future, it's not going "to the moon" ever.  Accept that it'll hover in the $500 dollar range in perpetuity.  No one is getting rich quick off this shit anymore.  It's over.  In fact, you deciding to buy and hold bitcoin for investment purposes decreases the chances of bitcoin surviving.  It's not going to $10,000-  Wake up and smell the fiat 
@_date: 2014-05-22 11:27:32
Should have cashed out at $1,000 in that case. That way I wouldn't have lost 40 percent of my money.

Probably because accepting bitcoin is like accepting spins at the roulette wheel as a form of payment.  It has lost 50% of it's value in the past ten months.  It almost makes more sense to accept Iraqi dinars

Back in January the expectation was that each bitcoin would be worth about $5,000 by now.  Instead, it shed half it's value.  In 5 years, if bitcoin is even still a thing, it'll be worth $10 per btc.  I hope I'm wrong, b/c I have a bitcoin.  I'm just a little upset that I paid $900 for it. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:42:07

I believe bitcoin will never go above $800 again.  That doesn't mean that bitcoin will not become more widely adopted.  I fear too many on this subreddit are more interested in getting rich quick (like those early adopters) than in the ultimate success of bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:17:00
Thank you so much!  So assuming I have the private key and it is legible, nothing can prevent me from accessing my coins, correct?  I shouldn’t need like a password or 2FA or something that I’ve long forgotten about right?  It feels like there’s a bit of a leap of faith putting the coins in a paper wallet because you never know if you will be able to retrieve them until you try. It makes me feel a bit uneasy!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:13:38
Ehhh one more question. What if it’s not in WIF format?  The private keys that are generated using bitaddress don’t start with a 5
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:29:41
Is there any way to determine if I encrypted the private key just by looking at the paper wallet I printed?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:53:54
I swear this is my last question. And let me say thank you again for answering my questions. I really really appreciate it!  Here’s my question:  what type of private key do I have if it’s 51 characters long and starts with a 5?  Is there a set number of characters regular run of the mill private keys come in?  Thank u again!!
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:20:22

I have all my btc on a paper wallet I made with blockchain info. I periodically buy more bitcoin thru coinbase and immediately send it to my paper wallet via the public address. Is this the right thing to do?  When the forks happen I’m not sure how to determine how much bitcoin cash or bitcoin gold I should have or whatever. How can I keep track of all this altcoin when it’s offline on my paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:53:57
Wouldn’t you already have it in your hardware wallet?  I’m confused 
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:48:21
Also curious about this. Several years ago I moved my coins onto a paper wallet using blockchaininfo and I put it in my safe. I think that’s called cold storage?  I’ve been buying more coins using coinbase but then I send them to my paper wallet by sending the
 to the public key. I hope that is right. I am so new to this. Anyway I’m not sure what to do since there has already been one split (bitcoin cash) and apparently there are more splits anticipated?  Any input is appreciated. Thank you!
