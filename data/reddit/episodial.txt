Silk Road 2.0 was hacked. All escrow cleared. This is the correct information. You're welcome.

I always thought her and Stevie Wonder would have been great together.

Oh so Sir Richard Branson, a circlejerk of success says that Bitcoin is the future.
Several others have as well.
I got ridiculed for stating the obvious in Seriously considering unsubbing that because almost everyone in that subs thinks too traditionally.
It's like 1980-1990s thought just froze in there.
Everyone still thinks accounting is a viable future option when so many, like Bill Gates, have projected it as a dead field in the future due to automation.
The main purpose of life, (this may sound too "bland" for all you free-spirited college students that think you should be squeezing memories like juice right now), is to retire.
The general college student is not planning life ahead enough.
They see a degree as the light at the end of the tunnel and then the job as the hallmark of success once they exit said tunnel.
It only gets harder, bills only get bigger, money gets cheaper, time only goes further along, technology only increases.
If you don't account for the future, you won't be prepared for the future, and you may not be able to even eat in the future, thus ending the future for you.

Yea the whole "preserving her image" ship has sailed.
You can't just make whoopee for a living and have people respect you.
The disrespect usually comes from social stigma but it also comes from people thinking you have absolutely no other skills that don't involve your genitals.
No intelligence, no practical knowledge, etc.

On a side note eBay is turning into an absolute shitshack of a company.
Combined with PayPal sellers have to pay around 10%+ in fees alone. 
The constant harassment from their billing department combined with tons of ludicrous policies make it virtually impossible to make a profit or break even on sales for the average joe.
Sure, chinese/foreign low cost/low value products are fine to purchase through eBay but a lot of other things can be found cheaper elsewhere.
Source: I've sold three things on eBay this year and have broken even on two of them. I lost money on the third item.
I've sold in the past and was fine with their policies. The aggression to sellers though is just sickening.

It seemed more like a blog and it wasn't really clear how I could purchase the product.

Well you must have both missed it because it wasn't a vote. It was a memo written by casascius himself.

You're going to regret that path of further bad decision. I guarantee it.

I really hope this "early bitcoin adopter from the US" was some average joe that forgot he had a shitload of bitcoins until just recently.

It could either be unfamiliarity resulting in, "I don't want to deal with this right now" like a lot of fast food or that they actually don't know how.

Such a weird guy. Weirdly beautiful guy.
