huawei is trustworthy at least in china because if btc is stolen you can sue them. 
hacker steals btc or. lets say. wow gold(must be huge amount of wow gold in that case). can be sentenced to up to 12 years or more in prison in china. in theory if you hack in to blizzard server and grab enough gold you will end up life sentence in jail and wont be released in 20 years without an executive order from the president. 
however user data is not considered of commercial value so obtaining user data secrectly is like kind of ok in china. it is how you uses it that matters. selling personal data can be a crime.selling home adresses of 1000 ppl for 500$ is enough for one year in jail. 
no way huawei steal btc. too big to steal. hacked? i dont know. banks have been hacked.before.so there is no garantee.

so far chinese gov is doing a good job make 1.3b ppl richer. so if you would kindly consider chinese are also part of mankind, the chinese gov is better than fine for the entire world,  especially when NOT dropping bombs to other country each and every year like EU and US do.

oh ok glad to hear you clarify you are not anti chinese. 
btw selling btc is tax free in china and stealing 100 usd worth crypto currency is techincally a crime because crypto currencices are protected as ppls legal asset. to ban scamming exchanges and icos is not that anti cryptoccurrency. imo mtgox is more anti crypto.

oh in china if you get insanely rich by trading btc or just sell your 20,000 btc after 5 years hodl bank managers get alerted and some girl/boy （depends in your gender）with really pleasant voive will call immediately. 
“morning sir are you interested in our LICAI program for premium customers only?  5.7% gain every year very low risk.”
it is also very possible that your cell phone number  get leaked and agents start calling 1024 times a day try to sell you insurance plans/expensive houses/...
but i do not think gov/police will get you. or maybe a local government guy might visit you and try to persuade you into investing in some manufacture plants or what ever is good for local emplyment and tax and eventually good for his own pocket.
looks like to me that china is a better place for btc hodlers.

why so serious?
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:35:27
so according to the trend. one should not invest in it since 2018. very likely to be close to zero or negative return.
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:12:29

north korea did had advanced(at their time) strong industry and higher gdp than their southern brother  when ussr was alive. they were able to trade and recieve tech amd investment thats how. and that is exactly the same what happened to south korea. you dont really think they can build semi conductor industry by their own do you. oh and south korea was ruled by some quite extreme dictator when their econimic began to thrive in the eraly days. ussr was once the worlds second largest power and high gdp though it was a promblematic one. 
my conclution is that isms do not neccesarily make a country ecnomicly successful or other wise but rather the election process and resulting quality of leadership. resource and political enviroment.  and fianlly national level “hard work save money invest in industry” mentality. 
if a country can not elect talent ppl to be leaders but rely on almighty and all knowing saints. guess what. saints are rare and do not live forever. and next fake saint is ruining all.
if ppl are lazt and can not save for investment. the entire country is helpless. 
forgive my english hope i made myself mostly clear. 
got to work. incoming mortage and credit card day  (눈_눈)

may i say. argentina and south africa vs china.
most medium to small countries are more affected by anything else but the ism thing. north korea was actullay richer when soviet russia was alive. and soviet russia was once doing fine and todays russia sucks. china is huge and it takes longer time to start the growth engine and hk benefits as a middleman when china can not do business with the rest of the world.  nowadays hongkong is not so everwhelmingly rich and shenzhen/ shangai is closing in fast. and small cities with a good port can almost  always be rich like singapore. oh i think singapore is a more gov(corrupt family for short here)controlled chinese country prerending to be capitalism and china is relatively  more a capitalism one pretending to be communism lead.
strong gov control is a good start for poor country. or country in ecconomic trouble, just look back in america history and we can all see that. a mixed market can be good.  
hard working , honest leaders, and safe and friendly international enviroment grants success. not isms.

not all socialism fails. china is fine though most ppl here will roll their eyes about socialism but still we are in theory a socialism country and leaders pretend to be socialist. 
it is about hard working and savings, not ism's. no ism will automaticly make a country rich maybe magicism lol. 
back in good rich days they did not invest in industry and tech. thats how they fail. stupid policy and corrupt politicians ruin everything no matter what. even make btc as national currency wont help. thats what i say.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:52:56
well the china communist party has long abandoned the ppl and the hk super rich guys get even richer thats how it happened.
so this is quite like 99% protest.
i really hope the communist party get back to her course and persuit equal and happiness life for the majority not just rich ones. millions died throwing  over the old qing empoyer and then invaders all over the world. the entire western world was upon us. later there is japan invasion and after ww2 korea war...war and death for 120+years.
 now these sacrifices will be in vain soon. the rich is possessing everything.....
that is why i support bitcoin. bitcoin can be a reminder that it is the ppl decide what history shall be. tyrany and corruption will fail.
