One small step for Bitcoin to mass adoption. I like.

It’s already here. Diamonds can be industrially manufactured.

Bitcoin needs Whale-Regulations. Market manipulations is hurting us.

Anybody know where I can get my hands on a Quantum computer *evil laugh*

Countries in the G7 will simply write off the debt. Then back to printing fake paper money, business as usual.

I recall a prominent bank in the UK making news headlines in 2018 because they closed hundreds of customer accounts with the argument they weren't profitable.

I would prefer to own 1 000 000 Satoshi, instead of 0.01 Bitcoin. Makes me feel richer.
@_date: 2019-01-16 16:26:14
Anybody calling for lower prices has an agenda. They need to STFU

Everyone’s an expert.

Because we are the 1%, everybody else is awakening.

Roger vs Craig and their Bitcoin Cash war and their threats to destroy Bitcoin was worrying.

I hold coins since all-time-high. My portfolio value is down 60%. The future is unknown however I pray it will rise like the phoenix.
@_date: 2019-01-18 05:28:57
Focus on the journey, not the destination.
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:33:04
Exchanges operating in the UK transferring money to/from EU banks is still not clear to me. Will they stay in SEPA.
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:42:49
Still relevant hence I posted it. Bitcoin price is calculated on market cap however it’s taking into account lost coins that will never return!

It is VERY stressful.

Inserted source. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:40:00
Exchanges do not insure your crypto hence proceed with caution. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:30:28
Depends on your lifestyle. I would be happy  with an amount that supports a simple and comfortable lifestyle. Nothing fancy.
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:45:11
Bitcoin is a disrupter. Those who fear change will call it radical. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:53:40
Nothing is stopping us now. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:58:57
Bitcoin can easily attract foreign buyers.
@_date: 2019-01-17 05:07:29
I'm having a deja-vu moment.
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:34:11
Here’s a life tip: Buy low and sell high
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:19:41
Not again. I suffered losses when I over-extended myself.
@_date: 2019-01-15 07:49:40
Venezuelan government already tried when they developed the Petro crypto in 2018.
@_date: 2019-01-16 11:51:50
So much coins must be tempting *wink*
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:51:09
I think Bitcoin would be more successful without institutions. I am against whales influencing this space.
@_date: 2019-01-16 06:42:55
The government is demanding exchanges pay taxes in crypto. They won’t accept the Petro *facepalm*
@_date: 2019-01-16 08:16:37
The figures come from CryptoCompare site. I check this everyday. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 16:53:51
**May the odds be ever in your favor**

Else, no new keyboard, instead they chop a couple of zeros off the end. I fixed global debt.
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:09:25
I once introduced colleagues at work to crypto. They don't like when markets are down.
@_date: 2019-01-17 03:43:38
She's a beauty.
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:52:25
Read an article today where the South African Reserve Bank is planning to put strict regulations on crypto and exchanges. Bureaucracy interfering again.
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:35:09
If they weren’t Whales then I wouldn’t think twice, we know what whales can do to the markets.

Bitcoin average 24H total volume is $1.28 billion. This volume is intense.
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:20:19
Have you tried to buy low and sell high. Whenever I try the market does the opposite.
@_date: 2019-01-17 12:25:45
Bitcoin name is needed to sell Roger’s shitcoin. What a fraud. 
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:14:55
You must have lots of friends.

Gold has value because of supply and demand, without demand it would not have a value. Same fundamentals can be applied to Bitcoin.

My pension fund was hit badly when Steinhoff accounting irregularities was exposed. A lot of shady business occurs in the stock markets.
@_date: 2019-01-17 03:09:08
Someone has a gripe with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-01-17 10:28:40
Article was explicitly about being incognito and hiding your identity. This is next level covert operations.
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:00:29
One moment it is up, next it is down. Repeat. I have to stop checking the price everyday for the sake of my sanity. Sorry for the rant.

Lets be civil people, a gentleman's duel.
Urban dictionary: A gentleman's Duel is when two men sit on their knees, usually on a bed, and proceed to masturbate until they ejaculate. The first person to land a load on the other man wins.

Looks more like a Museum. Fiat money are the relics on display.

I get the feel that most of us in this space are not revolutionaries. We did our KYC.
