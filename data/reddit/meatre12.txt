Spending half your pension on something and saying "ye i mightve heard of it"
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:15:16
This is so ridiculously stupid and over thr top commitment to a still very unproven market
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:28:50
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:01:24
And if u still had it and sold now you would maybe be missing out on buying a mansion in a year. You cant say what if
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:08:59
Your a grade A dumbass
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:42:40
Not really the same at all. A dude w a $300,000 house cashing out to gamble is a little different than a some rich guys losing ridiculous amounts of money. Worst case they lose 11 and still have a measly 55 million in cash. Worst case for op is being homeless and in ridiculous debt.

Butcoin isnt an innate thing like gravity that was discovered there isnt a single unique property to it.  Bitcoin is scarce because it was coded to be scarce that is the one and only reason. Bitcoin could be replicated an infinite number of times and literally the only thing to distinguish it would be the fact that one of the infinite copies is called "bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:56:23
I just created my very own physical currency called poopcoin and the only thing that makes a coin legitimate is if i personally draw a smiley face on 1 side. My currency is unique and therefore 100% legitimate and useful
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:09:54
Yes it is. There are a thousand bullshit coins that fuction just as well. This proves your point wrong. THERE IS NOTHING SCARCE ABOUT CODE. 
Gold is legitimately scarce and has legitimate properties that give it value, bitcoin has no useful properties outside its fuction as something of value and its scarce because of code. There is nothing special about that
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:31:48
You invest in bitcoin and are worried about shadiness
@_date: 2018-09-28 22:52:59
Well shit i guess your right in the fact that i dont understand why people would ever fucking care that a shitty store of value that has already been duplicated and replicated countless times is able to compute unbelievably pointless solutions to completely irrelevant problems that would never effect a human being in a million years
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:58:15
Doesnt really equate at all. The dumbasses that eat that shit willingly do it
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:51:36
ROFL XD XD
Yeah well I did in 1990 when bitcoin was $           .0000000
@_date: 2018-05-07 19:14:41
Ok so convert all of your fiat savings to crypto and see how that works out

I never said stocks start at 0. That doesn’t mean there aren’t literally countless assets that have made insane returns since inception. CRYPTO doesn’t start at 0 either. These fraud ass icos can  price their coin at 100000 if they wanted. 
I call people dumbass bc the entire btc community has been deluded to nothing but 15 year olds and financial illiterates talking about how revolutionary btc is when in reality they couldn’t even begin to explain it. There was a time when you were excited and proud to interact with someone else who was involved bitcoin and actually knew why they were involved, not just in it for the get rich quick scheme. Once again I don’t mean to be asshole but every goddam post “huhuh moon lambos haha”
@_date: 2019-03-17 13:55:08
Yeah guys bitcoin is the king !!!!!!������������������⚒⏱⏰⏲⏱������������������������
@_date: 2019-03-08 00:30:47
There is a reason for that. 
So let me get this straight. I’m assuming you believe that an asset that makes multi 1000% changes over the course of a few months is going to function as the worldwide currency?
If you want bitcoin to be the number 1 currency, it can’t have the insane returns that you brag about. Little bit contradictory. If the day ever came that btc did take over, would you all start shitting on it cause it doesn’t give you moon lambos anymore?
@_date: 2019-03-07 19:34:17
Hey dumbass, every single asset ever created has made an uncountable percent increase from inception.

Not even remotely but believe what you like. You all clearly live in a world of your own 
@_date: 2019-06-08 20:46:43
Lol no ones coming after your $200 in btc
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:11:21
Or your a dumbass bc it’s a pullback of the bear market
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:15:34
Dont listen to anybody. Fairly simple because NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THEYRE TALKING ABOUT 
@_date: 2019-02-14 21:23:53
Aaaaaand btc will be worthless bc every corporation can just make their own coin 
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:25:29
No he doesnt. You all think being a r/bitcoin member makes you some sort of finance wizard
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:17:37
Big guy over here 
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:58:59
Not even remotely the same thing

I think yuo talking out ur ass big man
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:04:10
Obviously, this is a bubble, theres absolutely no disputing that. However, we dont know how big itll get. Could be 12,000 could be 100,000

Forreal is there a sub where memes arent allowed
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:47:58
So faith, not demand makes price increase ? Didnt know thats how markets work
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:01:01
Im not talking about markets. Ive made plenty of money off trading, im talking about crypto/BITCOIN. The people that claim they know are the wannabe wolf of wall street with .1 bitcoin acting like high rollers
@_date: 2019-04-30 02:18:00
All coins are shitcoins
@_date: 2019-04-17 20:26:23
And hello to 10% swings over the course of an hour
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:00:51
If you get mad at seeing this you are the dumb fuck he’s talking about
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:43:48
Market cap is not meaningless you dunce. Keep hoping you become a millionaire off of crypto dumbass
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:44:41
Uhhh Btc going to infinity dollars per coin don’t you know ????
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:12:59
I understand that. 
There is a limited amount of money in the world. The people who way btc $1000000 don’t understand that even if every cent in the world was thrown into bitcoin, it could never reach a million
@_date: 2019-04-06 20:00:32
Pls tell me you are joking. Market cap is not a meme
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:58:46
Everybody is just addicted to 10% a day gains. Anybody that says btc just crashed is just part of the trading fad. Look at the chart and see how long the rise was and then how long it took to bottom. Not even remotely a crash just a legitimate correction 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:24:53
Oh wow didnt know u speak for rhe billionaires now
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:56:53
No, its simply not
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:27:43
Are u all trying to say thats a good thing? They only sold a portion and crasged btc more than 50%. That means they could single handedly crash it to 0
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:59:10
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:52:22
Wait till youre in that position and i promise it wont feel like motivation
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:32:41
You sir do not know what the fuck you are saying
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:11:51
Are we all just secretly 15 year olds making fun of all the other 15 year olds ??

Get this stupid shit out of here
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:45:31
I know the coinbase hate is big but crypto would be absolutely no where without it
@_date: 2018-04-04 17:41:06
Why? That is completely illogical
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:40:28
Good lord I’m srry but u guys r fucking retarded
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:35:05
You’re a moron
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:41:04
This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:38:57
Holy shit are they even trying to hide autocracy at this point? 
“Crypto will take all of our power away, pls don’t do it” I mean is this a joke
