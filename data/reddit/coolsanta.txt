You can't go around making uninformed comments or creating straw men in the hope that the person on the other side knows less than you. You seem to be making some pretty wild assumptions about my knowledge of communications networks and physics. I can only tell you that you are grossly mistaken. You are clearly not able to back up your guesses about what the protocol can or cannot do. As a software engineer of 30 years standing I can tell you that you are painting a pretty bleak picture of bitcoin's ability to do things in parallel. Latency exists but there are ways around it such as batching things or doing them in parallel.

The last green bar has turned red and we're essentially moving sideways now. The chart pattern seems stronger than if this were just a temporary rise. Bitcoin appears to be moving in sympathy with litecoin and the litecoin block halving. We should be holding these price levels or better at least until after the halving. If that happens there is also a good chance of breaking bitcoins long term down trends, something which seems to already have happened for litecoin.

You are not making any sense. It's 1/8th of the latency for blocks 1/8th of the size assuming waiting for the block to be transmitted is the main factor at play. Regardless, bigger blocks seem to represent a bigger risk. Keep in mind that larger blocks will have to have a larger associated difficulty thus making them take longer to mine. For smaller blocks difficulty can be set so that they take 1/8th of the time to mine.

@_date: 2015-06-18 11:18:44
I think it is pretty clear. More blocks instead of bigger blocks. What don't you understand about that? EDIT: ~~So to pre-empt the inevitable question about block reward I propose that instead of giving a reward for each block mined, a fixed reward can be shared by everyone that mined blocks over a given period of time, which would more accurately approximate having bigger blocks. If this is done the network is freed up to dynamically adjust the number of blocks mined by dynamically adjusting difficulty. It will be making these adjustments when transactions start backing up. This means blocks size can be kept at 1 MB. So instead of 1 x 8 MB block we would have 8 x 1 MB blocks. The advantage is that this can grow dynamically.~~  **A factor must be introduced that affects block reward and block difficulty equally - this will ensure that there is zero effect on expected mining revenue. The factor should adjust dynamically when blocks start filling up.  Any decrease in difficulty, due to this factor, will increase the block rate and lead to MORE BLOCKS and hence less transactions per block.**
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:39:39
I guess the case to be made for increasing the block size is even more favourable than that given that the raw block information - i.e. the transactions could be arriving as they are happening. The problem with doing blocks in parallel, is not so much that it is P2P, but that it is after all a block chain. You can't solve one hash without knowing the preceding hash. So yes, increasing block size is probably the better approach for that reason. Will have to call Gavin and tell him to revert to the original plan.

Bitcoin is a way for people to send cash to relatives in Greece without it ending up trapped in the banking system. It should not be that difficult for everyday folk to convince a local merchant to create their own bitcoin wallet and accept bitcoin payments for goods... Why? Well it solves a problem for people having to pay with bitcoin and it solves a problem merchants are having sending wire transfers to obtain supplies. Services like Cashila would allow a merchant to pay with bitcoin for supplies by converting it to cash into the suppliers bank account. Fortunately there is also a bitcoin ATM in Greece in case more bitcoin is needed. Although I have a lot of respect for AA/OP he is not taking into account that there may be other players such as vendors, merchants and foreign relatives or issues with things such as wire transfers, atm limits etc. -  by only focusing on a subset of the economy and taking an over-simplified viewpoint of the dynamics. He is generally correct if one takes into consideration the current level of knowledge about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:39:08
I assume you must be making some hidden assumption. Block size won't be reduced below 1 MB and the fact is that it is not happening today with that block size and probably won't happen in the future as improvements in technology will most likely keep pace with any latency issues that could otherwise crop up. Also increases in difficulty that occur due to technological improvement will counter any decreases in difficulty aimed at keeping block size constant. You will have to make a much better case to convince me you are onto something.

There will be less latency as you won't have to wait for an 8 MB block to fill up with transactions. Even when not full 8 MB blocks will have more transactions than 1 MB blocks and hence a higher associated latency.

You got it. See my reply to Natanael_L: "A factor must be introduced that affects block reward and block difficulty equally. This will ensure that there is zero effect on average mining revenue. The factor should adjust dynamically when blocks start filling up." Decreasing the difficulty will up the block rate and number of blocks so this is the same as what you are suggesting.
If we do not use the above balanced mechanism, which counters block reward then unscrupulous miners can add fake transactions to trigger a decrease in difficulty and increase the number of blocks available for mining at a fix block reward rate. That is what I meant by spam blocks. This will lead to all the bitcoins being mined long before the intended target date - which is the thing that we are effectively countering.

Why bigger blocks? Why not more blocks? Block reward can work like lottery so that miners can't increase the current rate of rewards with spam blocks. Mining a block would be an entry into the block reward "lottery". With this method the blockchain can constantly self-adapt and not require future updates.

You seem to be assuming announcing a block takes longer than mining a block. Do you have any data/statistics that backs this up? Clearly we don't have a problem with the 1 MB blocks today and you are assuming technology won't keep pace to keep latency manageable? The only real change I am proposing is a reduction in difficulty while keeping block rewards in line with the current expected schedule. A factor must be introduced that affects block reward and block difficulty equally. This will ensure that there is zero effect on average mining revenue. The factor should adjust dynamically when blocks start filling up.

Can't this processed be staggered, in other words with multiple blocks at multiple points in this process? Remember that I am not breaking a single block up into multiple blocks. Each is a separate 1 MB transaction exactly as happens today. The higher number of blocks is simply achieved by reducing the difficulty and reward. Also do you think the latency would be significant enough in the future if it is not today? Technology tends to keep pace and gets faster every day. Larger blocks have other overheads as you can imagine. They require more storage and more processing capacity due to necessitating a higher difficulty.

Since they are using the block size limit to spread FUD I would say they would like to maintain the status quo by preventing concensus from being reached. In order to be effective they can't give away the fact that they are bad actors and would have to create an aura of genuine concern.

It increases anonymity. So that payer and payee can't be linked based on the fact that there is network traffic between them.


This is not doing anything to reduce the ability of someone looking at the blockchain to infer the flow of money based on the amounts involved.

If you spend them they will not all have the same flipper public key. The coins will have the coin public keys suggested by the payee (whom has also generated the corresponding coin private keys and is keeping them private awaiting the coins being flipped to the new corresponding coin public keys). The coin keys are in no way related to the communication (payer/payee) keys which are used for secure communication and message signing only.

@_date: 2015-08-09 10:04:09
No they won't have the same "flipper" key. A coin always has its own coin public/private key pair that is distinct from the payee/payer keys. 
The coin's public key identifies the coin and the coin's private key is kept in the wallet of the person that controls the coin. 
The person (payer), that knows the coin's private key, can change the coin's public key (flip the coin) by recording a "Change of coin identity" transaction on the block chain that is signed with the coin's current private key. This effectively relinquishes control of the coin to the person that provided that new coin public key for the coin. When nodes see this signed transaction they will attribute the coin's value to the new coin public key (coin) from that point onwards. Coin's do not accrue balances, instead they are converted from one denomination to the other by splitting/combining - coins mimic physical money. See "Denomination conversion". These transactions are deemed legitimate if the old set of coin values add up to the new set of coin values. A signature must be provided for each coin "entering" the conversion to prove ownership - e.g. the word "RELINQUISH" (plus some random padding + plus a hash of the target public keys) encrypted with the coin's private key.

As already mentioned the key changes after every transaction. I also already mentioned that coins do not accrue balances.


Granted to some extent. I've also come to the conclusion that some of this can probably be achieved in a less intuitive way by manually generating new addresses and somehow managing the use of that. I've also realized that the main difference is really the use of "Payment Request" and the fact that amounts are split up into coins of different denominations, each different from the full amounts being transferred. That helps quite a bit. Maybe the best parts of this idea can be made to work in a way that is more familiar to bitcoin. Will give that some thought.


Bitcoin addresses accrue balances. With this scheme wallets accrue coins. If I make a payment of 123 BTC the only thing you will see on the last block in the blockchain is that a 100 BTC, 20 BTC, 2 BTC and 1 BTC coin changed identity to some new random identity. A pseudo-random sort applied by the bitcoin nodes can ensure that these changes of identity do not even appear adjacent to each other in a block. The nature of these amounts is that there will be many other transactions with the same amounts which will make analysis extremely difficult or useless...
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:07:33
 Bitcoin is ultimately backed by the value of the infrastructure that supports its role as money transfer mechanism. Imagine what it would cost to replace the Bitcoin infrastructure with something that has equivalent dynamics and utility. As long as a single bitcoin has non-zero value a collection of them can be used to transfer any value. As long as that need exists it will create a price equilibrium based on demand or speculative future demand. Given its niche as cheap decentralized international money transfer mechanism the price is sufficiently stable over the time periods involved for achieving that primary goal. On the flip side it's long term dynamics make it an interesting and attractive choice for investors. As price stabilizes it will become a reliable way to store of value.

Not necessarily. Automated transfer of assets implemented on the blockchain can provide the security creditors need to provide loans. Also, loans are not the only way to obtain capital. Loans based on centralized currency is the root of all the evil. Spending should only rely on savings, physical security, and investment (in the form of shares traded for decentralized currency) - not debt based on a centralized currency. E.g. If someone want to provide you a bitcoin loan to build a house they can get shares in your house in return. Those shares are recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain. If your house value goes up the value of their shares increase. You have to buy back those shares to own your house outright.

Most if not all the world's economic and political problems would not exist without centralization. Bitcoin is decentralized. I don't think you fully appreciate its importance. That is ok, it requires visionary thinking, which history has shown us belongs to very very few people. Do not rely on the majority of people to guide you on this, do your own research and independent critical thinking.

Oh my God you really are that dumb aren't you??? Andreas was making a fairly narrow comment on the immediate situation in Greece - i.e. ATM closures, most likely picturing people on the street that could not get their hands on money. Smart as he is, or due to this being an off-the-cuff remark, he is not considering the fact that relatives abroad can still send people in Greece money or that goods can be sold in exchange for Bitcoin. I in no way suggested that Bitcoin be adopted as a snap-over replacement - it could be phased in over time. Stop the ad hominem attacks. You sir are the undercover narcissist - creating straw man arguments so that you can feel smart. You are the worst form there is. You are certainly in no position to critisise others. You come across as an a*hole that likes telling people how it IS: "You live quite in a large fantasy world don't you? In your mind there is not even the slightest chance that bitcoin could fail right? Well tell you what: The real world doesn't work that way.". It does not matter if you are right or wrong - your attitude sucks.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:58:33
Don't lay words in my mouth in an attempt to set me up with a straw man argument. I believe in decentralized currency and at the moment that means Bitcoin and to some extent Litecoin. It has a greater chance at success than failure. Fiat has a greater chance at failure - it has already failed. Greece will gain respect by laying out its own terms. Why? Because everyone knows they have no hope of recovery given the current austerity measures that leave no room for growth and will leave to eventual default anyway. Problems like the ones you are describing are good ones to have. There are already plans underway to increase transaction throughput. I don't see the problem. In fact, people like you are the problem by spreading distrust in decentralized currency and standing in the way of the adoption that is key to its growth. And no, it's not cool going around calling other people idiots that probably have much higher IQ's than you do. Would you also call Andreas Antonopolous an idiot?

Explain your understanding of "fractional lending" and "benefits of centralized banking" so I can see if we are on the same page here. Banks want people to incur debt in order to be able to print more money which leads to more debt and so on... I am sure the interest payments add up when you loan out the same money over and over and over... Who do you think pays for all that interest and do you think it will make a difference to our lives if we get rid of a system which funnels money to the banks and the elite? It's not the idea of using a decentralized currency that is flawed - it is people's spreading of the fear of the unknown that is the real problem that I am seeing over and over. If these people will educate themselves better and become the "Andreas Antonopolous'es" of the world spreading the virtues of decentralized currency we will all be better off for it.

Find someone who is already doing something similar and and add the idea of using bitcoin. Google - maybe you will find something. You only have to find one local municipality that likes your idea. Once you have one working others will follow. Make sure you take a nice cut for supplying or maintaining the equipment. Maybe you can use Machine Learning to classify other forms of rubbish later on when you have gathered enough data. Placing the kiosks in high traffic areas/parks and enforcing time constraints and penalties will help cut out bad actors. The kiosk can activate based on the number of people around.

Greece is going to default one way or the other. Greece has to say straight they cannot serve their debt and then lay out their plan to improve their reputation and how THEY plan to pay their debt in the most reliable way. This means they cannot pay their debts (in the short term) if they want to recover economically.

Convince local merchants to accept Bitcoin and put up a display stating "We Accept Bitcoin". Give them pamphlets to hand out to people who want to know more. Alternatively (or in addition) get them to display a QR code with a link to a web site containing information. The website can contain instructional videos about Bitcoin plus links to Andreas Antonopolous's Youtube videos. Include information about the web site Purse.io - people like discounts. Include locations of BitCoin ATM's such as this one:  Tell them Bitcoin may be the only way for them to obtain supplies if bank restrictions are imposed - through services such as Cashila that can transfer Bitcoin into USD and into any bank account.

Excellent article! Bitcoin is ultimately backed by the value of the infrastructure that supports its role as money transfer mechanism. Imagine what it would cost to replace the Bitcoin infrastructure with something that has equivalent dynamics and utility. As long as a single bitcoin has non-zero value a collection of them can be used to transfer any value. As long as that need exists it will create a price equilibrium based on demand or speculative future demand. Given its niche as cheap decentralized international money transfer mechanism the price is sufficiently stable over the time periods involved for achieving that primary goal. On the flip side it's long term dynamics make it an interesting and attractive choice for investors. As price stabilizes it will become a reliable way to store of value.

You are not thinking creatively enough. The transaction speed is  not too slow. For small businesses that know their customers or for small amounts you really just need the transaction to go through. You can still ask for identification or have cameras at your tills. Larger transactions are typically of the nature where larger delays are acceptable. They are going to default anyway. The creditors are sucking them dry by not allowing them to recover. That is a far worse scenario.
@_date: 2015-07-05 13:50:30

Greece should set out its own terms as to when it will pay its creditors. Hopefully that will be when all other forms of currency have devalued to zero. Worst case is that using Bitcoin will be no worse than a bartering system, something they seem to naturally gravitate towards in times like this.
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:26:23
Stick to the topic please. ;)
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:43:53
If they default now and set their own terms they have a chance to be able to pay the debt in the future - especially if they switch to a decentralized currency that makes it very difficult to obtain unsecured debt. If they try to pay the debt now they will just keep paying interest and end up defaulting anyway. Recovery will take much longer if at all. They have to bite the bullet now even if that means gaining disfavour with their creditors. Their creditors are not interested in their long term survival but seek to enslave Greece with debt repayments. This is why the austerity measures are being kept at a level that is just not enough to give Greece any breathing room. Somehow, deep-down, they will gain more respect from their creditors by taking an extreme stance.

Your problem is that you are to stupid to admit that people other than yourself (i.e. smart people) may come up with creative solutions to problems that you are too short-sighted to see solutions to. Greece may not have the option to lend in the short term and would be heavily reliant on increased taxes an other forms of income BUT in the long term debt should be avoided in favour of mechanisms based on building Greece a better reputation.

@_date: 2015-09-20 05:02:10
(1) You argument is fatally flawed as there is no easy way to automatically determine the maximum that the network can handle. Instead an automated mechanism can be created to adjust the block size limit to hold all transactions most of the time.
(2) As you said the purpose would be to avoid arbitrarily large blocks AND to provide a good degree of stability (smoothing) in estimating resource requirements in the short to medium term. It is not a real limit as the network will auto-adapt to make blocks larger as required based on the average requirement over time. I don't see why you are apparently disagreeing with me... Keep in mind that sigma 3 would mean that the block can, on average, contain the full transactions load 99.7% of the time and would be almost 100% certain to catch up on the next block. For sigma 2 it is 95%.
@_date: 2015-09-18 08:28:52
The difference the blockchain and a database is that all transactions are signed and chained together in a way that neither the authenticity of the transactions nor the sequence in which they happened can be disputed. Additionally trustless means that you don't have to trust everyone and there is no incentive for everyone to be dishonest.
@_date: 2015-09-20 04:27:18
I disagree.
@_date: 2015-09-20 05:37:53
If I understand Gavin's arguments correctly then economies of scale are negligible in comparison to the damage you will be doing by limiting the block size. Perhaps an alternative and more creative approach is needed to address economies of scale the right way. It certainly should not be achieved by strangling Bitcoin.

Good idea. Except if someone makes a mistake there is no way to get their BTC back to them.
@_date: 2015-09-20 08:34:20
Increasing the block size limit will not noticeably increase velocity at this point in time. You would still have to wait 60 minutes on average for 6 confirmations. This is why we should not wait with a block size increase if we want a smooth transition. Once a significant number of transactions get routinely excluded, or there is a consistent back-log the scenario will change.
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:07:20
Indeed, because its negligible... Responding to my comment with "No" is a non sequitur. You are simply demonstrating a propensity to disagree.
@_date: 2015-09-20 01:03:03
It is counter-intuitive but change will result from leaving the block size limit unchanged - once the limit is reached. Removing the "ceiling" from the block size limit pre-emptively will not have an immediate or long term effect. It just means that once we reach the previous limit Bitcoin can simply keep growing. If anything it can only have a "smoothing" effect by removing the discontinuity imposed by a fixed limit. Block size should automatically adjust similar to difficulty based on statistics - somewhere between sigma 2 and 3.
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:25:25
If it happens then it would have happened anyway. Scaling everything up evenly simply gives us what we had before.
@_date: 2015-09-20 10:21:59
No. Increasing the block size limit does not necessarily mean that the number of transactions per block will increase. As long as the block size limit remains at a fixed ratio to the number of transactions (on average), and as long as the limit has not really been reached yet, then there is no inflation. Even if there is a once-off effect but we keep the ratio constant (on average) there will be no additional inflation after that.
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:14:19
Degree of centralization is negligible. This issue is not the tool for addressing centralization. It would be a fatal mistake to think that.
