You're welcome ;)

Yes, you are wrong. What about it, pray tell, sounds like "scam-city"?

Do it yourself instead of waiting for someone else to do it for you. Do something.

Thank you for the update!

Fuck the state. We don't need them, they need us. This is a futile attempt for control - poor Ben doesn't know they already lost.

Genius. Suppose the network and transactions are conducted via radio waves.

Discussing bitcoin in public?! How crude. We mustn't discuss dirty things like bitcoin in public. That would create awareness and educate people, the mere thought makes me vomit.

Why would you use paypal and not bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:24:08
that is unfortunate that fiat paid for six months of chemo, not bitcoin.

Bitcoin would have still been above any of those currencies.

Did you pay for the chemo in bitcoins or did you convert bitcoins to fiat?
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:56:12
What year is this from?

There is a gas station N of Austin, TX that is accepts btc.

Why Thailand and Bangkok specifically?

check out for more meshnet like we're working with cjdns and incentivizing nodes with bitcoin. We already have some infrastructure in place but needs more work.

bitcoin hasn't lost its value, in fact its gained value as more and more merchants adopt it and as the network effect of bitcoin increases - which it has ie microsoft adopting bitcoin and google searches for bitcoin up 38%. Furthermore, a low price is good as it allows people to accumulate more bitcoins and simultaneously lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers into the space. These factors will lead to eventual mass adoption and then your precious price will finally be "to the moon".

Joke's on you kiddos! You, I, we, are already immortal. Most have not realized this yet. Matter cannot be created or destroyed. You have always been around and always will be. 
As for perfect preservation of your physical vessel - body - in its current state  - that technology is approaching.

Thank you for the constructive feedback!

True. I stuck with it for 3 episodes to see where it goes. Only fucked up propaganda by the industrial-military-hollywood complex.

Do Quit College and Join a Programming Bootcamp. A four year degree is a waste of your time and money and as we know time = money. Programming Bootcamp last on average 10.8wks, they havea 90% placement rate in the industry, costs an average of $10k and graduates have an average starting salary of 105K. A four year degree is obsolete. If you decide to go to Programming Bootcamp and your friend decides to go to a 4 year degree program he will most likely graduate with debt and no guarantee of a job. While you will graduate in 11wks, and by the time your friend gets out you could be making 300K. 
This is the fastest way for you to make enough money to buy btc.

There was never a bitcoin conference in Dallas. All the Texas Bitcoin Conferences have been in Austin. This guy got the shirt from goodwill.

Thank you for the advice. I'll repeat the recovery process with extra detailed attention to the passpharase and report back
