Good video, but I chuckled when he called non-bitcoin currencies "real-world currencies." 
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:41:02
I call them "government-issued currencies" as the term "fiat" is mostly unknown outside the Bitcoin/Austrian Econ world.

Yes, it's subjective, but their popularity attests to their ease-of-use. Further, how many Bitcoin ATM's are around? I'm a crypto-fanatic and I've literally never seen one in person. And you'd be surprised how hard most people would find using most mobile wallet to transfer finds from an ATM.
The complaints about their service, while they dominate this subreddit, are quite uncommon and not a problem for the vast majority of their users. Which is one reason why they keep adding new users.
In an ideal world, Coinbase wouldn't be the de facto entry - and the easiest way - to obtain Bitcoin for most people (at least in the US), but in the real world, they are.

This exchange is, in a nutshell, why people are starting to flee Bitcoin for altcoins. Too many Bitcoin leaders are simply saying the sky is purple regardless of the reality in front of them.
There is no entity, group, or even person who is "governance-free." Governance just means how decisions are made, and every entity, group, and person has to make decisions. Satoshi made decisions early on, Gavin did so later (and differently than Satoshi), and so on. The fact that influential people in Bitcoin now want to deny that fundamental reality is a reason it's in the mess it's in.
We don't want no governance (that is impossible), but decentralized and fair (in the sense of representing all parties based on their impact on the ecosystem) governance. The cryptocurrencies which solve that issue will be the ones with the best chance to succeed long-term.

Who defines "better?" For the crypto-knowledgeable person, perhaps (but they already have accounts), but for the (especially US-based) newbie, Coinbase is the easiest, best option to get started with Bitcoin.

This sub represents a tiny minority of the world. You need to get out more, and also remember that people who don't have problems don't post here.
And no, I don't work for Coinbase - I've been a customer for over 3 years and I simply recognize and appreciate that they have brought many people into the Bitcoin ecosystem, that's all. I don't think they don't make mistakes (and any mistakes should be corrected if possible), but that's true of all companies.

You seem to be unable to distinguish any nuance. "Governance" does not necessarily include "force", and no one is suggesting it should with Bitcoin. What we are suggesting is that governance systems which best represent all users in a fair, decentralized, and open way will be the ones to succeed long term. 
The Bitcoin community can ignore reality all it wants, but it shouldn't be surprised when going against that reality will have consequences.

Short Answer: The Free Market
Longer Answer: Altcoins are a very important part of the cryptocurrency world, for a few reasons:
**Altcoins provide competition for Bitcoin.** If there were no altcoins, Bitcoin could very quickly become stagnate, with an air of entitlement. With the existence of altcoins, however, not only does Bitcoin have to compete with government-issued currencies, but also with other cryptocurrencies. This forces Bitcoin to adapt to market conditions or die.
**Altcoins allow for experimentation.** We have only seen the tip of the iceberg in regards to what cryptocurrencies can do. However, with a multi-billion dollar marketcap, Bitcoin can't afford to be a testbed for every new innovative idea. Altcoins can provide that testbed.
**Altcoins provide for niche solutions.** Imagine a small country or community that wants to have its own currency. They might have certain economic views that aren't completely consistent with Bitcoin, but they can easily create their own altcoin and use it as their own currency. 
These are just a few reasons off the top of my head. Remember, Satoshi didn't just create Bitcoin, he created the modern cryptocurrency. Bitcoin should not become a sacred cow that wins by inertia; the best ideas - and best coins - should be given the ability to win in the marketplace of ideas.

I created an online tool to get the value of a list of addresses from multiple cryptocurrencies (currently BTC, LTC, DASH, DOGE, PPC).
You just have to enter a list of addresses, and the tool calculates the total combined value of all the addresses (and checks for invalid addresses in the list). Also, once the list is submitted, you are given a URL to access that list easily in the future.
Let me know what you think - I'm open to any suggestions to improve the tool.

The best advanced book on Bitcoin is Andreas Antonopoulos' [Mastering Bitcoin](
And if I may, you could consider my book [Bitcoin Basics:101 Questions and Answers]( for a more general overview of Bitcoin.

If they have suspicions regarding tax evasion by a specific person, then they can get a court order to get that person's records. Otherwise, how is this any different than if they asked for all of Bank of America's records because they think some might be evading taxes? I for one prefer that it is difficult - and for very specific reasons - for government agencies to view private data. Better for a few to evade taxes than for everyone to live under a cloud of suspicion.
And to your last question, I don't think there should be a capital gains tax. That would make it simpler. :)
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:24:04
That sucks, dude. And you are absolutely right that Bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream use yet. What is exciting about Bitcoin is still its *potential.* Hopefully it will reach that potential in the next few years and be ready for mainstream acceptance.

Others can argue about the legitimacy of the IRS and even taxes, but in this case the problem is overreach and confusion.
The IRS does not claim to have evidence of someone specifically avoiding their taxes, they are just doing a fishing expedition and putting every Coinbase customer under suspicion.
Also, there is a lot of confusion and controversy on how exactly Bitcoin transactions should be taxed. As a commodity? As a currency? Someone who uses Bitcoin for daily transactions faces a nightmare trying to follow the proper rules. It shouldn't be so hard to actually be compliant with IRS regulations.

You can still use them as a bitcoin wallet - you just can't buy or sell bitcoin directly with them. You can send and receive bitcoin to any address from your Circle wallet.

I didn't say they were a *good* bitcoin wallet. :)

**Bitcoin Community Past:** Bitcoin means freedom! Anyone can fork the code and let the market decide what's best!

I think you bring up some important points, but this "debunked myth" is problematic:


Yes, it is true that running a full node has advantages beyond just helping the network. But you make it appear that a full node is *necessary* for Bitcoin users to have a safe and secure experience. If this is the case, you've limited the use of Bitcoin to a very small number of people. Ain't no way my mother could use it.
I ran a full node for quite a while, but finally ditched it because using a mobile wallet, a Trezor, and a paper wallet was far easier and convenient, and for all practical purposes just as safe as a full node. The only reason I would fire my node back up now would be altruism.

It depends on how vigorously authorities want to enforce money transmitting laws. In Florida some guys got arrested for selling bitcoins via localbitcoins, but I think there was some drugs involved as well. 
Some jurisdictions might look askance at someone selling lots of bitcoins via localbitcoins, saying they are a money transmitter and need to register as one, but probably for small amounts you'll be okay.

The fact remains that most people (at least in the first world) don't see any way their lives can be directly improved by Bitcoin. Credit card transactions work fine for them (they of course don't directly see the huge cost of fraud and inefficiency of CC networks), and they are too used to an inflationary, government-controlled currency to consider that there may be a better alternative.
It may take a "black swan" event to bring about widespread adoption of Bitcoin. Either that or a slow, gradual acceptance.

A more likely connection is to charge a small fee (perhaps a few satoshis) to read an article without ads. 
But as long as there are free ad-blockers that work, there will be little use for even that.

Organizations hear about the benefits is the Blockchaina and think "That sounds great - it could save us money!"
They hear about Bitcoin and think "That sounds terrible - we can't control it!"
Ultimately they want the benefits of the Blockchain without the lack of control that comes with Bitcoin. What they don't seem to realize that what they really want is just a shared database that they don't have to pay for.

You could try to find a job at [xbtfreelancer.com]( or other similar site.
Or, you could just find any job, get paid in $$, and then buy bitcoins with that $$. If you have a job right now and use direct deposit, you could use [bitwage]( to automatically convert your pay to Bitcoin.

I like the idea of a Bitcoin debit card, and I'm glad to see Coinbase doing this. However, I do have a couple of concerns:
1) I would be interested to see how chargebacks are covered. If I buy something with my Swift card, and then I need to do a chargeback, will Coinbase put BTC back in my account? Who will confirm the legitimacy of the chargeback?
2) Also, this doesn't sound like a very good deal:


"For a limited time" - so soon just using the card will cost money? I don't see how that is very attractive to anyone - who pays a fee every time they just make a transaction? If Bitcoin is supposed to be a cheaper way to do transactions, why will this debit card cost more than a regular one?

Is this the first you have heard of the Shapeshift hack? Because Vorhees has been taking responsibility for it from day one. For a while there, there wasn't a day that went by that I didn't see him out front on the issue. 
And of course, everyone thinks their site is "not hackable" until it has been hacked. That's why forcing all companies to store unnecessary personal information is insane.

Bitwage allows you to put any portion of your paycheck into Bitcoin. So you could just take out, say, $20 per paycheck and have it converted to Bitcoin.

Here are a few examples:
**Why was Bitcoin created?**
As both an electronic payment system and a currency, Bitcoin was created to resolve problems of both a technological and an economic nature. Technologically, Bitcoin addresses the inefficiencies of traditional payment systems, such as expensive transaction fees, widespread fraud, and slow money transfers. Economically, Bitcoin addresses the requirement of a trusted third party for financial transactions as well as government control of the money supply.
**Who owns the Bitcoin network?**
No one person or organization owns the Bitcoin network. Like the Internet it is built upon, Bitcoin is decentralized, and no single entity controls how it operates or how bitcoins are distributed and spent. This is unique in modern-day currencies, all of which are created and controlled by governments. The running and development of Bitcoin is based upon consensus, meaning that the users of Bitcoin decide how it will operate and function.
**How is Bitcoin superior to this credit card payment system?**
Bitcoin uses a completely different model for payment, one that is more like cash. When you transfer bitcoins to another person, all you give him are those specific bitcoins. He has no way to access any more of your bitcoins. You don’t even have to give him your name or contact information if it is not required for the purchase. It’s just like giving a $20 bill to the cashier – but it can all be done electronically. Bitcoin, however, also works like cash in that it is non-reversible: once you transfer those bitcoins, there is no way to get them back unless the other party agrees to send them to you.
The answers in the book build on each other throughout the book; for example, the answer to "Why was Bitcoin created?" raised a number of issues, which are then answered in separate questions later. Each answer is pretty short - at most one page in length. This is to keep the book simple and reach the broadest audience.
