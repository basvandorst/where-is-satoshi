That means banks would stop being a thing overnight. While a lot of people here seem to think that would be a good thing, would the fact you could no longer get a loan from a bank to buy a house really be a positive?

I have 2 btc that i bought when coins hit $10. I'm holding onto them because why not, but the fact that there isn't some kind of "bank" to hold my coins, and the fact i can't do a chargeback has stopped me from really getting into them. There are just a ton of little conveniences built into the current system that bitcoin is lacking.

I can replicate it on this laptop, but not the other two laptops I tried. Huh, guess it was just something I need to fix. Sorry bout that.

Just as a heads-up, Adblock Plus on Firefox blocks the notification window from popping up. Disabling it and refreshing let me set a notification, but for a bit I thought I was doing something wrong.
