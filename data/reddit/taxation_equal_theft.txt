Stocks down 1% for a day 
Crypto down 50% for months
Totally comparable

Yeah good point. I guess my argument is flawed. I think the main problem is people are spending way more than they can afford to pay back on crypto because they think it will double in price. Nobody is dropping 10k on a vacation that they can't afford, but tons of people were dropping 10k on crypto expecting to sell it for 20k. When the value cuts in half they can't afford to pay back.
Like I'll put 2k on my credit card knowing I'm gonna pay it off immediately just so I can get the points. But I might be inclined to put 10k on the card if I think crypto is gonna double. I could only afford 2k but I took the risk and charged 10k hoping it would pay off. Just an example... 
I never did this, but I know a guy who did. He made a shitload off his initial investment into bitcoin and just kept buying on credit the whole run up to 19k and then kept buying the dip down to 10k. It sounds stupid in retrospect but he went from a net worth of 20k to a almost millionaire in a span of a six months. He was willing to take the risk because if bitcoin just made it to 25k he could sell and retire before 30.
Now hes paying for it because he owes credit card debt and refuses to sell his bitcoin for the current low prices.

Yeah that’s kind of the point. The tv can be sold to pay the bill. Crypto could be worth 10% of the purchase price by the time you try and sell it to pay the bill

U mad bruh

The tv still has value and can be repossessed. Crypto could be worthless by the time you fail to pay it back and they can’t repossess it
