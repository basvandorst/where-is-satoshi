So you’re saying as a beginner purchasing 40$ of btc Robinhood is NOT a good way to learn the market? Robinhood is not going bankrupt, but if they do and OP loses 40$ but learns the market enough to then be comfortable enough to make larger investments with someone like ETrade or Fidelity then I don’t understand why it’s such a bad idea. I have made thousands on Robinhood. No commission’s to be paid. Margin available if needed. Instant deposits and speedy withdrawals with no attached fees.... I mean it propelled me to use a broker. Had I never discovered Robinhood and it’s insanely easy and user friendly system I would have never moved on to anything else. I’m just saying. As a beginner, obviously buying $40 of btc at this point means they are just starting out and to me, Robinhood will make the entire trading process make more sense. I think it’s a phenomenal tool that is easily accessed and used with very little prior knowledge.

This was wholesome. I have been educated. Thank you sir. No BS, I learned from this. ����  Great way of explaining it. I was under the impression I was buying BTC that I could put in a wallet if I wanted. Glad I profited and the transactions cleared flawlessly. No more Robinhood for me. Now that I think of it, Robinhood is such a fitting name. Next level trolling.

Buy more. A lot more. Use robinhood. Easiest when just starting out. Live updates. Sell or buy right from phone.
