I think you’d be checking for a looooong time (millions of lifetimes) before you came across one with a balance. That’s the whole security of Bitcoin!

Damn that’s quicker than I expected. I assume the process involves brute forcing until they come across an address with non zero balance?

Ah yep that makes sense that the block reward address would be baked into the hash calc.

Right but how do they make sure this is the case? I could say the same thing about a PC - the private key never leaves the device - but since its connected to the internet, it obviously can in some cases when there is foul play involved.

This makes sense but surely there are science/maths problems that can utilise the bitcoin network to generate results and simultaneously be mathematically impossible to shortcut

Careful! I would really pull this image and block the code a little better if I were you. Just in case it's actually a private key
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:54:37
Yeah that's what this thread is suggesting. Tie the solving of those problems to bitcoin mining aka profit
@_date: 2017-08-16 02:40:25
Right so it's more a case of implementing it from the beginning and carefully selecting the algorithm 
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:21:15
It's totally necessary, but if the energy and infrastructure is going to be used regardless then shouldn't it be used for something useful on top of keeping the network secure?

If you account for the cost of buying the rig and the amount of time you'll spend getting it to work, from a purely financial standpoint you'd probably make as much money by getting a part time job for a week or 2 each year. I was interested for a while but after watching a bunch of videos you realise that it's a lot harder than simply buying a rig and letting it run wild. You also have the risk of a market downturn which would quickly squash profits. 
But if you want to do it for fun then it would probably be a really educational and enjoyable experience

I'm not exactly sure on the math / process of protein folding so I don't know if it's able to structure it so that the time to complete is predictable. But that's just one example, it would be nice to believe that there must exist some well understood algorithm that simply requires brute force attempts to solve but that when solved is useful for research, science, society etc etc
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:10:48
Totally. Would be interested in seeing the actual numbers/comparison if anyone has done the math. But it just seems like it would take minimal effort and virtually no downside to switch the bitcoin model to generate all these extra benefits. It's a massive untapped potential which doesn't exist in the world of real currency. It's not like a bank teller could be simultaneously finding primes while they're processing transactions.

Despite the thread title it's not necessarily a waste of energy that the concern, it's more the waste of the available computing power that could be concurrently generating useful data / solutions to problems 
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:01:21
I guess the difficulty of finding an algorithm is why it doesn't exist on a massive scale yet

Yeah I’m kind of confused as to why less people will be able to run nodes? Hard drive space is constantly getting larger and larger and at lower and lower cost. People don’t worry that mp3 files are no longer 4mb each (since now a much higher bitrate is standard and mp3s are like 10mb). It seems as though as time moves on, files get bigger and hard drives get bigger to keep up. Am I missing something?
Also, why would it be bad for miners to be able to define the way forward as opposed to the devs?
