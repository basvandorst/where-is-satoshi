0.01btc :P

Well on a second thought, I think it can easily be that the submitter's english is just not good enough, Zuckerbeg said something they didn't understand, and his buddy thought it was about Bitcoin. Kind of adds up, if he actually asked them a question him walking away so fast doesn't make a lot of sense.

If you want the bank to transfer 1 penny to another account the bank is going charge you WAY more than 1 penny for every 1 penny transaction. Bitcoin would still be a LOT cheaper.
But you don't do that. Microtransactions should actually be avoided even if not to the extent they're avoided with fiat.
Currently however you CAN do microtransactions with bitcoin with some work. This will likely be fixed in the future.

This got deleted before, not sure if I did it accidentally or a moderator, so posting it one last time. These seem to be similar services, although they don't look reliable.
edit: nevermind, just went to the bottom of the page. new to reddit.

OP's issue is that there have been too many micro transactions to a single address. Hence in order to transfer 0.01 BTC (the minimum required for free processing) he a huge  transaction needs to be fabricated, because all the receiving addresses needs to be listed in it. 
If he just receives 1 transaction to 1 address, then sends 0.01BTC to that address so it's eligible for feeless transfer, he can send that 0.01+X BTC from the address with a small transaction.
That way he can divide the one huge transaction into several smaller ones that are individually eligible for free trans.fer

my feeless transaction finished in like 2-3 hrs 2 weeks ago.

^^^^^^^^ This. 
Why do you ask for the document? This is fishy.

Hello. I just gave a legitimate working solution to make microtransactions in bitcoin 3 minutes b4 your post. Or I'm wrong?
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:45:55
I've got no idea, but since it'll never get confirmed you can just spend that BTC again I believe? Probably not with Bitcoin-QT though, and you'd probably have to manufacture that transaction by hand. Or with some special client.

0.00005400 &gt; 0
But that's 54 thing is new, I thought it was 0.00005. Source please?

The specification says nothing about priority, that link is only about the details of the implementation of the current (or rather some previous) default mining software, no? I'm pretty sure there are several miners using their custom software for scheduling, so some trial and error would work better here than guesstimating by implementation details IMO. What I do know is that I never had more than a few hours of delay when sending transactions without a fee. Didn't send that many though.

Other than that, nice idea. But why do you need the whole document for this. It makes the service unfeasable for most scenarios the service could be useful for.

If you just gave me a private key nothing would stop you to give me a private key you already "gave" to someone else, so


holds true.
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:30:37
Yeah, you just can't pick the amount of money you want to transfer to me then.
@_date: 2013-05-27 11:59:20
That's not a valid transaction I believe? Fee is required for transactions below 0.01 BTC according to the current BTC protocol no?
@_date: 2013-05-27 09:08:39
Or you meant how big the transaction was in bytes? No idea.
@_date: 2013-05-27 09:37:47
Awesome. Which browser supports it? Cause the latest Chrome requires me to upload the document.
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:55:11
I've got no idea, you could look at the transaction sizes and calculate that. I doubt there's any publicly available software that does this. If you go with 1 transaction per address you'll surely avoid it.
@_date: 2013-05-27 15:05:56
Yep. That was the issue, thanks a lot. I'm gonna try it out in the following days.

If giving me some bitcoins would only be the businness of the two of us there wouldn't be any control. No one could check if you actually own the bitcoin you want to give to me.
Work of other entities beside the sender and receiver is necessary for every transaction. It's not "free" in the grand scale. Sending just a tiny bit more than a penny is actually free FOR THE CLIENTS currently, but in future it's very likely that every client will be forced to pay for the extra workload they put on the network.
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:19:31
wouldn't pay a terrific hourly wage if you did.
@_date: 2013-05-27 19:29:21
Realistically speaking, if YOU wanted to give me $1 worth of currency, it would certainly cost you a LOT more to get that money sent to me physically than to pay for the workload you'd put on the Bitcoin network.
If we were standing physically in the same room, it wouldn't. That's an advantage of physical currency that will never be overcome by any virtual method.

As far as I know there has been no official statement about it from any authorities, I don't see why it wouldn't be legal.
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:42:05
One way to avoid it:
-Have 0.01 BTC on a "clean" address.
-Receive a micro transaction to another clean address.
-Send that 0.01 BTC to the address that received the micro transaction with a transaction fee of 0.
-Receive a micro transaction to another clean address.
-Send that 0.01+x BTC to the address that received the micro transaction with a transaction fee of 0.
-Rinse and repeat. Forever.
-Have infinite bitcoins without every paying any transaction fee.
(damn i really wish I knew what the ????? was)
