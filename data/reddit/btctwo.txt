It's not peer to peer if you don't run a full node. But Ver and Wu are trying their best to be the next Musk by [turning Bitcoin into their Paypal 2.0](
Blockstream was founded by some of the most accomplished developers contributing to Bitcoins reference client. Anyone with a slither of common sense could see how the combined expertise of these people, who were responsible for birthing a paradigm shift in finance, would be worth investing in. The evidence void idea that their interests might have shifted simply because they accepted money is asinine and deserves the ridicule it receives. 
Blockstream has no control over the software I run. Making them responsible for the community of hundreds of thousands of people not coming together in hardforking to BU is beyond incomprehensibly stupid. I can see the resources my full node consumes and I am **never going to hand control** over that to a hand-full of chinese miners. It literally blows my mind how you are unable to comprehend this: Simply increasing the blocksize results in gaining virtually NOTHING at incredible cost to network health and **people are not willing to accept that trade-off** regardless of what Blockstream says.

In the current system you lose 100% of your investment if you fork to an incompatible chain. With BU the network will continue to build on your forked chain half the time. You'd lose 50% of your investment. Plus there's the scenario of accidentally executing an attack. BU significantly weakens the concept of a confirmed tx. You are inconvenienced that people don't accept your 0-conf? With BU I wouldn't accept anything below 12 conf. 
The only counter argument so far has been "That's unlikely to happen because people won't use the emergent consensus parameters that way". Which in essence boils down to adding bugs to the protocol for features no one will supposedly ever use and weaken the security model of the blockchain when people do use it.
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:52:18
I'd be happy to pay 4,50USD for tx up to 100USD and 4% for anything beyond 100USD (Assuming we ever get propper fungiblity and privacy upgrades for Bitcoin)
Those numbers are close to what my Bank changes non-customers for ATM withdrawals. So I don't even have to think about it twice because I would very likely pay 2-3x more  for the privilege of using a global, immutable, permissionless, sound and anonymous payment network.
People asking for 0c tx fees while stomping their feet just show the world how little they value their freedom. That's why I'm most likely going to be happy with a 1MB blocksize in my lifetime. Fungibility and privacy on the other hand... not sure whether I'll wait for those featuers for too long.

No users don't "vote" nobody "votes" users decide to SF. Miners have 3 options:
1. SF along with the users
2. Continue mining as they did before while not including invalid tx
3. Forking the network by attempting to mine invalid tx
The incentives are still aligned against 3. And no one is left unhappy with 1. or 2. win win.
It's hard to understand the BU dogma of "miners dictate what bitcoin is and how it is used by voting on it" and "if one person owns all the miners it's his right to decide because he has invested into asics.
Users dictate what Bitcoin is and how it is used. Miners follow or split.

Satoshi was so right in asking Assange not to use Bitcoin. It turned out the threat to Bitcoin wasn't a state agressor though, it was Bitcoin's success itself. 
We onboarded to many plebs to early. Just imagine how many protocol optimizations could have been implemented without any friction from reddit propaganda. Might have even managed a few hardforks with just a little more time...
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:48:19


While keeping in mind that nodes are ranked by economic value. The absolute number of nodes does not matter. One user could spin up 5k nodes enforcing this change and have no effect if the rest of the economically relevant nodes (payment processors, exchange, services, etc.) decide to accept non segwit blocks.
This activation mechanism requires economic support to succeed. While this is a very fuzzy topic it is a perfectly viable upgrade route considering upgrading Bitcoin through miner collaboration is no longer possible.

How does my choice of using SW impact miners that dont want to use it? By all means don't use SW. Nothing changes for people like Wu. Everyone can do as they please. Conflict would only arise if Wu decided to spend bitcoin that dont belong to him. The beautiful thing is that this would instantly split the blockchain, which no one wants. Everyone gets what they want and are incentivised not to misbehave. 
In any other case BU supporters would get the hardfork they demand. It's a win win for everyone.

I don't see how this is the case (or what it is supposed to mean). This is a baseless claim without any proof what so ever. Remaining faithful to the following claim: that which can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence... I call **bullshit**.


What's this "voting" you speak of? No one is voting for anything here. All that is required is for me to decide to make a SW tx, 1 miner to mine it and the rest  of the miners not to steal it or else fork what we used to commonly consider the valid blockchain.


It will only result in a hard fork if a miner decided to steal a SW output just as it could fork now if a miner decided to steal a bip66 output (currently 17% of all tx). I don't see you prancing around bitching about bip66 forcing miners to HF. 


+1 internet from me for the attempt though.

No need for measurements. We compile the flag day activation into the core client and see what happens in Nov. If segwit hasn't activated by then my node will reject non SW blocks and I'll leave it running for an hour or two. If by then no SW block has been found miners will succeed in retaining the current development deadlock. If a SW block is found my node sais arrivederci to miners who want to forcefully strip me from using a purely optional update that has no effect on users that choose not to use it.

Maybe ETH will be the future of crypto. Who knows. Currently Bitcoin is the most stable, tested and secure Blockchain out there. An advantage of Bitcoin (unless it goes the BU route) will always be it's layered complexity. The base layer is as simple as possible while allowing more complex functionality on higher levels. 
There is a clear trend for developers with brains to flock to Bitcoin. If this trend remains, ETH and other alts viing for BTC's throne will have to come up with truly earth shattering improvements. If Bitcoin vs fiat is car vs horse... ETH will have to become the airplane to be relevant. So far none of the alts, as handwavingly awesome as they might be, promise blockchain powered flight.

@_date: 2017-03-05 02:17:48
A UASF will never be a normal SF because a normal SF triggers exclusively when miners reach the activation threshold via the signaling mechanism. A SF with 55% signaling poses the same threat as a UASF with 55% miner support. Whether or not miners are enforcing the the SFs rules is irrelevant. UASF are a mechanism to demand support for their SF or let the miners fork if they decide not to. If the majority of users is behind the SF miners will mine economically less valuable blocks on the non SF fork. UASF does pose a risk only if the SFing users are a minority. If the run-up time is long enough there is ample opportunity for users to gauge adoption with services, miners, etc. and then decide to enforce the SF or not.

1. Fork. In this case miners will exist that mine my chain. Worst thing that can happen (short term) is block times may increase, big whoop.
2. Unanimously Forfeit. In this case my node wouldn't see any new blocks and I'd be forced to accept non sw blocks.

bip66 also triggered a HF because miners signaling anything means jack shit. Only because miners now do not steal bip66 tx doesn't mean all their nodes are capable or willing to accept and process bip66 tx. They might very well be non existent to them aside from the fact that they don't allow users to steal the tx (HF detection already has a standard implementation in the bitcoin client). This isn't forcing anyone to use SW this is asking you not to violate SW as to not fork SWtx onto another network. 
In any case I find it ironic that now that UASF are on the table HFs are suddenly a bad thing and to be avoided at all costs. UASF August 2018 and let anyone willing to HF HF. No one is forced into anything. But this time around no one will be compensated for anything either. Skin is in the game.

Thats kindergarden mathematics. Fees are determined by supply/demand and the collective subjective perception of what including a tx on the blockchian is worth. 
Keeping all parameters constant the following things can be said:
1. Increasing supply will decrease fees (lower bound for the fee is 0USD with near infinite supply)
2. Increasing demand will increase fees (upper bound is what ever the most expensive fee an individual would be happy to pay)
It is asinine to argue that increasing fees will lessen user adoption (demand) while at the same time parroting that more supply will cause lower fees. 
If the LN were to activate tomorrow a new fee equilibrium would be determined. If fees onchain became incredibly low people would use onchain tx again. If fees onchain became too high people would use LN. 
**Conclusion:** Arguing about fees with or without LN is fucking retarded. Either you want bitcoin to scale past 7tx/s or you do not. At 1MB blocks a 2.5USD fee per tx would cover 100% of the current block reward. Does this mean we should let miners cripple the network indefinitely for their short term profits? UASF is the only way forward these days.

USAF is probably a misspelling of UASF which is an acronym for "User activated soft fork". 
Clients running the UASF code give miners the time to activate SW by Oct 1st 2017. After Oct 1st 2017 UASF clients will reject non SW signaling blocks. If a significant portion of the community (exchanges, businesses, users, wallets, etc.) opt for the UASF it is possible to activate SW without using signaling mechanism which currently depends on 95% of the miners getting their shit together.

A UASF would have a long run up much like a hardfork. It wouldn't activate without significant adoption with full nodes, businesses, exchanges, miners, etc. If the economic majority decides it wants to UASF miners will be incentivised to tag along instead of sit on their hands as they do now.
If miners choose to not upgrade their nodes to detect malicious blocks they are accepting the risk of ending up on their own fork. Regardless of how economically viable and how much hashrate the two remaining blockchains have. Miners have to actively choose to remain on a forked network. If both networks persist, this is obviously what people wan't. There is nothing wrong with it.

I think he will disagree with your assessment. But other than that I personally don't mind the idea of capping tx size. My use-cases will probably be covered any way. Well let's see if someone will code this up as a SF and get 95% of the miners signaling support for it.
From my technical expertise I have a feeling not many of the devs involved in Bitcoin will care to add a tx size limit when SW already provides linear sighashing. But we can always try right?
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:15:15


So we end up with the same problem as always. It's clear as day that no one wants contentious HFs. We all agree that it would be a disaster to Bitcoin's network effect and future if we had more than one Bitcoin blockchain going forward but we can't force everyone to agree upon the same thing. 
I have strong sympathy for the substantial portion of people who want to avoid the implications of HFing the protocol. I would probably reject a SW HF myself as well if it didn't include other HF wish-list items. Which only compounds the problem of getting people to agree. It seems that doomsday scenario aside. We will not be able to perform a non-contentious HF. 
I blame Assange for the whole mess we are in. Satoshi was right, Bitcoin wasn't ready to be revealed to the world. We will never see fungibility, privacy and scalability in Bitcoin.

Miners signaling doesn't mean they are validating the rules of a SF either. As was proven by the BIP66 HF. A flag day makes it clear that people have to either be on board or risk the economic penalty of network disruption.

PoW change will only occur as a last resort if the network fails to function reliably (only empty blocks are mined, tx are being censored or reorgs by 51% attackers start occuring).

This is incorrect. We have to let go of the notion of being able to reconcile all Bitcoin users. All Bitcoin related game-theoretical concepts assume *intelligent rational decision-makers*^[\[1\]]( Common sense should suffice... but even without it, it should be blatantly obvious that the terms "inteligent" and "rational" in this context are... problematic. 
It is better to come to terms with it earlier rather than later. To move forward people will have to each go their own way. I don't know how you feel about it... but to me... if Bitcoin fails to more forward and we see no fungibility/privacy/capacity improvements within the next two years. The project might aswell be dead to me. I'd prefer a chainsplit to a useless network any day.

A chain doesn't get orphaned. What are you talking about? Blocks can get orphaned. A BU chain can be reorged. How would a SW chain be "orphaned"?
@_date: 2017-03-04 18:27:13
The difference with a HF is you suddenly have two blockchains. Whether they are viable or not doesn't matter and simply depends on how much value users attribute to the two different chains. 
UASF remains one chain until a miner decides to steal bitcoin from a SW address. This would instantaneously split the network into two chains (as would a contentious HF). The entire BU camp should be happy about UASF because they are free to execute their desired HF any time they want. 
However as soon as UASF came up in the discussions you could hear the loud noise of goal posts being shifted over at rbtc and the agenda had to be readjusted. I say UASF August 2018 and let Wu do Wu as much as he want's.

Go here: 
Notice how the relevant parameters aside from power consumption are *hashrate* and *difficulty*? Notice how **none** of those change when Wu decide to switch his asics to mine some other shitcoin?
That's right! Forking the chain does jack shit to miners BTC earnings. They remain exactly the same! The only thing that changes is the frequency at which blocks are found. Miners might actually make more money on the slow chain as fees would rise.
The block rate could remain at 1block/hour for years and I still wouldn't be compelled to use Wu/VerCoin.

@_date: 2017-03-24 12:31:48
Hardforking the difficulty has all the draw backs of a HF and no benefit besides increasing block time. Imo as long as 24-36 blocks are found per day there is no real reason to HF just to change the difficulty. 
If the chain is split however I would expect SW SF to be less contentious and easier to coordinate. Even if the activation period is extended from 2 weeks to 2 months.

I was referring to Ver's entire emotional core bashing crusade which is routed in Core developers and Blockstream not condemning the censorship on rbitcoin. Now that this has occurred we can remove rbtc because it has served its purpose.  
@_date: 2017-03-03 22:08:54
Let me clarify something: The only people you will find telling you what Bitcoin was "meant to be" you'll find over at rbtc. The rest of us isn't concerned with what it was 'meant to be'. We care about what it is, what sets it apart and what it could be in the future. And most sane individuals around here have **not** come to the conclusion that Bitcoin isn't meant to be cash. They have come to the conclusion that it is *asinine* to believe that we can retain what Bitcoin **is** and what sets it **apart** if we cram the global demand for starbucks coffee and other micro transactions into the base layer of the Bitcoin protocol. 
So that being said, I'm looking forward to paying for my coffee and steam games using Bitcoin while still running my own full node on the server I run at home. Because if I can't do the latter I don't give much of a shit about the former.

Not only will a BU HF never happen... even if it did, there is absolutely no guarantee what so ever that miners would be able to use the EB AD parameters to actually come to consensus over the blocksize. 
The problem would always remain the same. At what point would a miner accept the risk of splitting the network. Every single time a miner creates a bigger block he has to weigh the risk of his new block creating a fork. The entire mechanism doesn't work in a distributed algorithm. Where it does work of course is if the most powerful miners rallied around Wu's OBEC (Organization of Bitcoin Exporting Countries) and continously decided to accept forking weaker miners of the network. The more centralized the system the easier blocksize increases could be pushed. The fact that full nodes can set AD and EB is of absolutely no significance at all.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:00:31
Ok wasn't sure which one you were refering to. Well on the exchange I buy my Bitcoin there is a huge warning on the front page. "Buyer beware: Highly speculative investment. Can lead to major/total loss" Which is a fair warning imo. BU reorging is a risk people are willing to take who invest in BU. The exchange isn't responsible for such an event. So as much as some people might stomp their feet about how shitty BU is. That won't stop greed from motivating one or the other exchanges from listing it.

Wins the rbtc statement of the day! What is "maintain one chain" supposed to mean. Miners always get the same BTC payout no matter how much hashrate a chain has. At 50% we'd find blocks every 20min. Anything between 2-3 Blocks (30%-50%) per hour is more than enough to sustain a functional blockchain (fees will most likely even rise for miners!). Retargeting would take a month sure. After which we'd most likely have double the capacity from SW and miners profiting from a lower difficulty (if the rest of the chain decides to stick with their choice).
@_date: 2017-04-03 02:09:20
Are you able to observe the current situation? Can you tell what the blocksize is? That is what it will remain if you don't accept SW. If you fail to see how SW is a blocksize increase, how it is an improvement to the protocol, that is your problem to deal with. 
You can drag a cow to the watering place but you cant force it to drink.

@_date: 2017-04-04 12:08:19
No it's not the same. EB creates an entirely new set of UTXOs that the original chain has no clue exists and is entirely incompatible. With SW you can still see all TX happening only the witness to some tx is missing. SW is a slight degredation of security. EB is removing any notion of security all together. 
@_date: 2017-04-04 13:06:49
Of all scaling ideas had so far EB is literally the worst. Can't come to consensus about protocol optimizations? Let miners force any arbitrary change via EB! It's EC on steroids. Can't have control over block size? Why not take control over everything! Ofc Wu loves this one. At the very least this will be more entertaining to watch fail than the BU filibuster that is officially over now that Wu moved on.

They have mistaken signaling readiness to upgrade with some bizzare concept of 1cpu 1vote, *who ever manages to control a monopoly of asics dictates the rules*, bullshit.
And as it turns out SW isn't controversial for it's blocksize increase. Its blocking is simply a hostile attempt to push some incoherent agenda and disenfranchise the entire user base. Block everyone from a voluntary protocol upgrade that no one is forced to use.

Future SF upgrades should have native UA. Miners get a long activation period. If that expires it's a perfectly valid option for users to proceed without the miners that stalled the upgrade progess. If this forks the network so be it. We need start realizing that some differences in Bitcoin are irreconcilable and in order for there to be progress people will have to go separate ways.

Blockstream is working on Liquid. It is marketed as a open source technology to reduce settlement lag between exchanges and other semi trusted parties.
SW and LN would eat into that business concept. Blockstream would stand to lose a lot of ground if the Bitcoin protocol were allowed to progress. Who needs Liquid when you can open up a LN channel between exchanges. Fortunately people investing in Blockstream are not investing in the tech. They are investing in the brains and those brains will continue to work and adapt to the ever changing crypto-landscape.
There I gave you a review of shit you can choose to ignore and continue spouting your AXA Blockstream Core blocking progress bullshit you illiterate nitwit. Blockstream doesn't need to utilize chemtrails to convince us of your stupidity. We can see it for our selves. 
The mere idea that **IF** you and the rest of your BU filibuster could convince core developers to tow your party line, would cause the entire community would rally around a non-contentious HF proves how out of fucking touch you are with reality.

SW! LN! Eclair! Do want!

A decade of fraud perpetrated by asic manufacturers, who mined with the hardware they were selling (only to ship it once it was obsolete), plus subsidized electricity, has caused severe mining centralization.
It is time to UASF and prepare a PoW change should the situation go down the drain. We have to set a precedent to show people we won't let a hand full of individuals hold the entire network hostage indefinitely.

So if were not controversial it wouldn't change the rules of the Bitcoin protocol?
It's like pulling teeth with idiots here :D

r/btc is r/buttcoin on steroids

Nothing of what you wrote is substantiated. It's one conjecture based on the other. If this then that and because of that then this. Not a single shred of proof along the way. Nothing but FUD.

And once they are overrun with demand what are they going to do? Move their blockchains to chinese data centers faster than Bitcoin?

I see you haven't seen many interviews with Amir Taaki. His answers and explanations are usually worthy of being compressed.

BU isn't a solution to anything.

The question isn't about whether they are rules or not wtf? The question asked was whether the rules of the protocol Change. And the answer is a clear NO. A subset of people decide to ADD rules. Not a single rule is changed as is evident by the fact that you can participate in the protocol without upgrading your node.
How can this be so hard to understand?

Stating your opinion as fact makes you look like a fool.

"If we had all ascis in one place this would have never been an issue! We'd have big blocks, 1million USD per BTC and no asicboost controversy! Damn you CORE!"

We'll have nice things down the road. FuckWits have no perseverance. They will dissipate into the next get rich quick alt and entirely disappear once they realize there wont be a second coming of Bitcoin Jesus that will make them wealthy enough to buy lambos over night 
It be a shame to sacrifice Bitcoins network effect and thereby set the entire crypro currency movement back by decades but the end result will be the same. The cat is out of the bag and we will have decentralized p2p networks such as Bitcoin+SW+LN. Just have to wait a little longer.

Yes it will. Asics are not the problem. Individuals capturing gigantic portions of hashrate and letting the resulting power get to their head is the problem. 
Changing PoW and thereby tanking their investment will teach them not to attempt to amass such power again. We had the big GHashio scare back in the day when the pool threatened to reach &gt;50%. These days Bitmain spreads their hashrate amongst 3 pools and no one seems to give a fuck about it. On the contrary. Idiots over at rbtc cheer Wu on. They want to see him control 80% of the network so they can finally fork their shitcoin.
It's pretty sad to see what Bitcoin has become post 2013. We onboarded so many [iliterate get rich quick idiots]( (thank you Ver!) that things are only going to go downhill from here.
