It was a Saturday night in Tennessee at a RV hippie commune located on top of a mountain near Bonnaroo when I was on shrooms. I was going around the bonfire telling people about Bitcoin and how the issuance of currency based on fractional-reserve manipulation was flawed and how Bitcoin was a weapon against that system.
At that time the price was hovering around $30 and I wonder if people looked into it and made money from it when it was still mostly unknown to the uninitiated.

Those aren't what I was looking for but thanks for contributing. The website I was referring to said their service wasn't up and running yet but were in a testing phase.

Bitcoin is a part of a global awakening of consciousness that sees past labels of left, right, etc and is against the ideals of centralization of power and total information awareness.

Good for dehydrating your magic mushrooms that you sell for BTC

Sorry about that. ;)

Yeah they're stealing everyone's money. Same thing happened to me.
@_date: 2013-03-23 00:11:36
It did but for some reason it won't work anymore. Maybe they changed the API around on MtGox or something...
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:03:49
Yes they're taking people's money orders and not giving anything back.
