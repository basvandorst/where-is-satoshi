Very weird print at 8:50pm  precisely down to 3000

That can be your price target. Also, I didn't say when..... when we stop growing producing and consuming stuff I guess. I think we're good for a little while though.

The current price gyrations are speculation. The actual value is just a graph of how much value has been put into bitcoin (cash, labor, property) and nobody has even started to use it yet. When 90% are in... then look at the price. All that labor and profit accumulates in bitcoin. It could go to infinity.

The tsunami of money coming into this space will make these arguments, now, trivial. It's the digital gold rush...the people looking to strike it rich are going to buy every pan on the shelf...
