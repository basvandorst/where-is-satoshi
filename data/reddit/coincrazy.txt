There as been quite a bit of good news. Problem is there has been an equal amount of bad news or FUD and sentiment is down right now. Just give it some time and things will turn.

And the hits keep coming. It's going to be an even bumpier (sp?) ride in the near term - let's just hope btc will prevail.

I have been looking for a reliable source for a while can you let me know who you're using?

Yep. This is the perfect time for big money to get cheap coins which is why we see gold and silver moving in.

Unmasking the creator of bitcoin is something many people want to do but in the end it doesn't make a difference who did it. I see where you're coming from though.

I agree. It needs to be done but how? This is loaded gun banks and government will be able to use against bitcoin until a resolution is found.

Thanks for the info. I've never heard of this before.

You're right they suck I tried several.

Is this legit or what? So many conflicting stories.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:03:11
Hopefully this is legit and it sticks.
