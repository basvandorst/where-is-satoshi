This isn't the new strategy described in the paper, but I hadn't heard/thought of  "*Block Withholding Attacks*" before:
tl;dr: a miner, when completing a block, doesn't publish it immediately; instead they get a head-start on adding to the block-chain *presuming* their block.  The moment somebody else publishes a block, they jump out publish their previous block, and hope to get their solution accepted by more-others (and, if they've managed to add to the chain, they'll have a longer version).
However, the paper indicates that it's a previous result, that if two mining pools are each trying this, they'll both end up lowering their expected reward.
[I haven't processed the rest of the paper yet, about the 'fork-after-withhold' strategy.  Still, I thought the above was interesting.]

$11k?  I remember when bitcoin was up at $11k...

In particular, you can get $800 worth of BTC.

(Or just to balance out the stated opinions a bit:)


That's cool.

I was surprised to buy a bit, and they keep track to 6 decimal places, which works out (currently) to millipennies.  (So I could sell to the nearest penny, and still have about 0.000257 bitcoin that nobody would pay me a cent for.)

I bought some a month or two ago, and am shocked at the variability: it's been up 20%, and down 20%, all within a week.  Definitely *not* an investment to make w/ money you can't spare, but a reasonable long-term thing to try with some of your disposable income.  (A bit like gambling at a casino: don't risk more than you can stand to lose, but it can be fun and perhaps even profitable.)

It's worth noting that since all waste-energy turns into heat ... that is just as good as an electric-heater.  So if you have electric heaters, you might as well just use any other electrical device that gets hot.
(Though: most heating systems use heat-pumps, which are more than 100% efficient, because they're actually grabbing heat from elsewhere rather than creating it.)

Do note the double-standard though: we're with the author's claim that they couldn't look in to every ad they sold.  But then we turn around and say that Google not looking into ads is "willful ignorance at best".
This is why the "fake-news on social media" is kinda scary: we are asking/requiring the content-providers to try their best to determine the truthfulness of the content they provide, which is a short distance from holding them accountable for the information that individuals post on their system.
(Not saying I have any answers -- the fake news is literally damaging, and we just have no good way of trying to limit the damage, now that a few con artists can even more effectively reach millions.)

tl;dr: "I want my own BTC to go up, so I'll exhort everybody else to buy NOW!"
(This is tongue-in-cheek ... but thinking more, it's not exactly distorting the message, either.)

But there is a difference: If I gave an average redditor $100k in cash, and 3 days to launder it, it'd be difficult for them to do it well.
Give them $100k in bitcoin, and they probably could do it successfully.
So the ease of laundering is something that does change the scope of things.  (Like: in 1900, sure somebody might pirate a textbook by hand-copying it.  When photocopiers came along it was much easier, and happened occasionally.  With electronic copies, it happens all the time.)

Yeah, that was my thought: make up ten new addresses A, B, C, ..., J, and then transfer varying amounts from A to B to C to ... to J.  Do that through Tor, in case people are trying to track the IP addresses which are originating the requests.  Also trade between BTC and other alt-coins (so that there's ownership changing hands).  Now it's hard for somebody watching the ledgers to tell who/where the money is.

Though, 1998 cars are significantly less safe than current cars, so it's not a direct comparison.
Even for features that were also standard in 1998, many are better now -- tires last even longer, timing belts are replaced with timing chains [don't require a 60k replacement], the transmissions are better and need less repairs, etc.
Even more, typical phone plans were $35 in 1998 ... but those were land lines where caller-ID was an extra, advanced feature.
So you really do want to use a basket of goods to compute CPI, not just one particular product. The CPI is computed by economists who really are genuinely trying to capture the *actual* rate of inflation.
