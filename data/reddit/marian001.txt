Hey, congrats to your Bitcoin ATM launch!
However, it's still Bratislava, where you will find an ATM with the cheapest bitcoins in Central Europe. Just 3% on top of BitStamp :-)
@_date: 2015-06-05 17:27:28
I guess this could have been expected - 
@_date: 2015-06-16 21:26:51
you're right, I'm able to run this ATM on minimum costs...   
@_date: 2014-01-18 14:10:32
it dispenses only bitcoins in form of digital currency
@_date: 2014-03-14 09:06:04
Lovely! Could you add some with Euro symbol?
@_date: 2014-04-20 13:33:49
Yes, if fact I would like somebody to try... Lamassu claims the software has passed a security audit. So if there is a real vulnerability, I would prefer to have it fixed rather sooner than later.
@_date: 2014-04-08 10:49:16
I am concerned more about this part:


@_date: 2014-04-23 13:45:20
Organizers wanted to present a bitcoin ATM, so they contacted me and asked me to bring my Lamassu machine. However, later they decided not to risk having problems due to unclear legality of exchanging rubles for bitcoins.
Anyways, it's great the conference is happening.

The machine's camera can be used for scanning an ID necessary for KYC. However, this will only come with the next version of the software.

I just returned from my cousin's wedding and I feel like sharing my first experience with creating a multi-sig wallet I gave (along with 1 bitcoin) to this couple as their wedding present. I used Armory (in Expert mode) to create a wallet/private key for each of them and one for me, and a multi-sig lockbox. I created a 2-of-3 lockbox so that if one of them looses their key, I will be able to help. So they have received a multi-sig wallet with a lockbox definition and each of them their own sealed private key.
They don't have any experience with Bitcoin yet although they already knew something like that exists. I gave them a brief intro to Bitcoin and will continue in providing information to get them up to speed. For now, I told them to make sure they store all of it securely and hope that in a few years it will become a much greater gift than it is today. They are both excited to be one of the first people in their home region of Slovakia to own a bitcoin, but also to be one of the first married couples with a multi-sig bitcoin wallet.
Thanks goes to Armory team for doing a great job with their software. The [documentation]( on creating and managing a multi-sig lockbox is very helpful and it just works perfectly!
If you feel like chipping in, their wallet address is [3LW8bJvQaBjYi3Qkq8X5fWBxDfCrndrudh](

only 3% in Bratislava - 
@_date: 2014-04-20 07:37:58
Hello everybody!
Here's operator of the Lamassu machine in Bratislava, Slovakia - the first bitcoin ATM in Europe. First of all, please note, that all Lamassu machines run on beta software which has its problems. In case of my machine, the most frequent problems are related to connectivity, but there were also quite frequent freezes. However, the machine also relies on Bitstamp and Blockchain.info APIs which can cause problems as well. Recently, Blockchain.info was under DDoS which meant the machine could not even start properly. In addition, the Lamassu team is applying updates/bugfixes to this software from time to time or the machine just reboots itself which may result in wifi network selection screen. I don't consider this a security issue. In fact, you can setup a secure AP on your mobile and use it to connect the machine to the internet and successfully use it.
I am well aware of all these issues and I work with Lamassu to help them resolve the issues. And I usually visit the machine once a day to check on it - I don't have any way of knowing what is the current state of the machine unless I'm standing next to it. I will put up some signs making it easier to find it only after the software is reliable. You can find some info at  (so far only in Slovak language). I will greatly appreciate if you can inform me about any problems you encounter via info The new software (see the article on Coindesk), which should be more stable, should be in place in about 3 months. Until then, I ask you for patience. Feel free to contact me and I'm sure we can work something out to make sure your next visit won't be another disappointment.

OP expects them to become familiar with Bitcoin so that they can both spread the word and spend the bitcoin when they see fit. I also believe studying Bitcoin significantly improves financial literacy which will benefit the young couple as well...

there's a recently launched Bitcoin ATM in BigBang store of BTC City - 
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:29:21
what about Colored Bitcoins? :-)
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:52:40
bitcoin accepted at both Colonial Cafe and Regal Burger  (if the boss is present with his iPhone :-))
@_date: 2017-09-07 13:38:53
plus SegWit please..
@_date: 2016-05-22 22:06:49
I can recommend this store:  
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:47:40
great! added..
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:42:39
thank you!  I guess it's time for me to get familiar with bitcointips :-)
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:32:30
actually, the passage is closed for the night, so not exactly 24/7, but pretty much all day...
@_date: 2013-03-03 16:45:16
Yes, an android phone should be sufficient. Seller can run Blockchain app and even specify amount to be paid and generate transaction specific QR code for customer to scan and use to pay.
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:13:02
No, the price would still go up due to endless money printing all over the world. There's much more than just 24/7 service, low fees and quick transfer.
@_date: 2013-05-06 23:12:56
@_date: 2013-05-21 20:49:57
agreed.  it never hurts to have a choice
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:08:15
Yeah! Except something like that would have to happen to the whole global financial system. And that seems to be a wishful thinking nowdays.
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:51:17
thanks! added..
@_date: 2013-07-27 17:52:21
BreakingTheSet is great too

I use KeePass so I don't have to type the password each time. Saves time and protects against keyloggers.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:49:24
Thanks, I like the website but it seems the service is not yet operational. I would also like to see it operational for some time without significant problems before I add it to my collection.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:52:33
Let me suggest the line of thinking you should take.
Mt.Gox is not Bitcoin. Mt.Gox is your own exchange. You make the rules. Set the rules in a way to attract the most customers and generate the most profits.
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:48:32
You should talk the seller into accepting bitcoin. That would lower the costs and time needed.

I have put together and am maintaining a list of useful links on bitcoin:

10 EUR for 30Mbit/s in Bratislava
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:24:01
Deflation, decentralization and freedom are good things and that makes Bitcoin a good thing too. If you don't believe that, go and follow your beliefs, use a currency of your choice... Nobody is making you use Bitcoin.

ATM operator here :-)   The ATM is no longer in ProgressBar (hackerspace), it is in one passage in Bratislava downtown - see 
It is true that this one was made public before the one in Helsinki. So I guess we were the first bitcoin ATM in Europe :-)  ..and there is a plan of placing another one in Slovakia.
BTW, almost 70 bitcoins sold so far...
However, the article doesn't mention the ATM in Bratislava and the picture used is a RoboCoin ATM in Vancouver.
@_date: 2013-07-27 11:36:07
switched to wuala but will ask dropbox to accept bitcoin :-)
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:26:07
These could be useful for newbies and anybody hungry for information on bitcoin. Any further suggestions are welcome.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:38:05
why would I store my bitcoins in Google Wallet under my Google login and reveal that link to U.S. government?
