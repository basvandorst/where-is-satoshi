Iran has oil, so other countries have to buy BTC for their fiat in order to get Iran's oil.
Iran then can sell BTC for Dollars or other fiat in case they need it. Or with a wider acceptance they can buy some other goods they need directly with BTC from other countries.
On the other hand..
Just 1 average tanker holds 1-2million barrels of oil, so according to today price it worth 108-216 million $.
If someone decides to put that kind of amount on market it will go really crazy (bypassing the moon to the motherfucking pluto)..
and here people suggesting to switch completely on bitcoin?

Comparing to Kodak-Nokia case everyone here does, Banks have direct influence on Bitcoin.
How do you purchase them?
You send your money to exchange/any other payment processor. (don't tell me about the p2p market as it's tiny fraction of the whole sector).
So in case Bitcoin will impose some serious risks for Banking sector and Government money control they simply forbid to have any transactions related to Bitcoin purchase/sell which will lead to an underground p2p market which will be in a much smaller scale than it is now...
but I like changes, I own Bitcoins and like where this is going, so I'm definitely readied my popcorns!

What pisses me off the most is that:
According to the latest [Income Statement](
For the Apr24-Nov24/2014 period MtGox total expenses were around: 2kk$! having some hefty lines like Professional fees: 740k$ and roughly 276k$ in Trustee's fees.
With creditors money being sucked out at that astonishing speed Goxxing never stops, until there is nothing left...
For example I don't understand, what takes so long to distribute those coins?
All the accounts with balances and withdraw addresses are clearly in the database, why not just distribute accordingly those 259k BTCs and then if more is found distribute those!
Just bullshit...

Yes, seems something shady going on.
Flag 1) Have 180BTC, but says international passport is expensive.
Flag 2) Says that its difficult to obtain international passport, thats BS!
Needed docs: Application, 2 photos, internal passport, tax id.
Flag 3) pevernon says something about 2 accounts but OP didn't mention he have 2 accounts.
My assumption is that OP might use them to launder BTCs.

Good luck
