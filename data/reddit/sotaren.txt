I'm no expert but doesn't it show fiat getting turned into Bitcoin **at** the exchange? Not money coming **into** the exchange. There was already lots of Yuan in the Btcchina exchange. It's a closed system now, circulating cash for coins. It has nowhere to go but down, unless something changes.

"Rob Schneider is a successful memory artist who has just memorized 1000 Bitcoin private keys and is running from hired hitmen, when he suffers amnesia from being hit by the car of a poor kindergarten teacher trying to save her school from financial ruin. See Rob Schneider in 'The Brain Wallet'. Coming this July. Adam Sandler says it's the best performance since The Stapler."
