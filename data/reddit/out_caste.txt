Too late for me to reply I suppose, but I see the same issues.
There is a reason why biological species look and act so distinct from each other. You'll never find a clean gradient between two related species in the same environment because the competition is too intense, there is strong selection against it. It would be like two colonies choosing to live in a state of war. One wound never choose to maintain a state of war. It may be a cost for survival or success, but it is not a goal in and of itself.
Unfortunately I don't think the bitcoin core has a plan for this scenario.

There are plenty of periods of times where deflation has occurred and has not cause recessions. My point about it being made up was more about "deflation is more dangerous than inflation". I do agree that rapid change in a currency is going to mess with a market, especially where you have sticky prices and fixed contracts (due to the prior expectations of a stable currency) but this is irrelevant to whether it's inflation or deflation. There are far more examples of runaway inflation causing issues than the other way around.
Any argument that can be thought of against deflation on the technical/nuts-and-bolts level can be applied to inflation equally (and often times is more applicable to inflation) just by flipping the question.

I'm super slow with my responses.
The value of the currency continues to rise until the imbalance is resolved, so it will inevitably resolve itself. Is it possible that everyone with crypto wants to hold through this and the value will just keep going up? In this current environment, yes, because as you pointed out literally everyone could be acting irrationally, but this hypothetical assumes that bitcoin has become a stable/general purpose currency. This is the equivalent of the USD jumping in value and everyone was told it was temporary and that the value would come back down by tomorrow. This first thing you'd do in response to this is go on a shopping spree.  At this point, bitcoin may steadily grow 2-5% a year, so a huge single-day swing is a lot different than today. (it's possible people won't know what is going on and will think it is some magic bull run and will HODL, but keep in mind, this scenario assumes all the money is being called on the same day and that everyone is misinformed including the day traders/investors)

Government intervention can still kill it. Nobody want's dirty illegal internet money that is difficult to convert into fiat and only is used on the black market. The joke about how governments cant stop it is simply not true.
All they need to do is link bitcoins with a terrorist attack if they need an excuse. At the prices some people are talking about (+$100,000 a coin) can collapse the US dollar. The bigger bitcoin gets, the more governments will see it as a possible threat to their currency/national security and will make any excuse to squash it.

Based on what I read it is probably more accurate for me to say he oversold the protection he was providing and failed to understand the limitations of that protection.
I am limited by my knowledge of encryption, but as the original [critique]( stated, Lavabit claimed it was "so secure that even our administrators can't read your e-mail". According to the post, that is not true.
Ladar Levison [responded]( to this critique partly conceded that point. He explains what could have been done under "A changed landscape" section. I understand hindsight is 20/20 but the product offered was still a failure, he shouldn't have relied on his SSL key to provide security that can be undone by a subpoena. He best argument is "I wasn’t the only person to miss this change in the threat landscape. Almost everyone else did, too." So we have a "but everyone else was wrong too" from him and then from you we have a "of course it puts other users at risk". So he either built a system that knowingly put other users at risk or at best he's asking forgiveness because other people missed it too. Sounds shitty to me.

The growth in value is not aligned with the growth in the user base. This indicates that growth in price represents users that are putting in more money as the main driver. There is nothing wrong with this, there is reason to be more confident in bitcoin's future, but if a large portion of the money comes from this source it changes the assumptions everyone is making. 
Things that would indicate new users (in english speaking countries):
Google trends
I like this one because people that think bitcoin is full of shit are unlikely to check out the wikipedia. 
(check out the delta when on this site, it's the button next to "Metrics" on the right, it displays info per day rather than in total, although some info is not collected daily and it makes the graphs all weird) 
Also check out the video stats for "What is bitcoin" another common new user point of information (this appears to be the number one bitcoin intro video). It shows growth slowing down (check "daily" info)
Reddit bitcoin subscriptions also are also fairly linear (cant find the info, but I've seen it).
All other graphs indicate a similar trend, the userbase is growing and interest has grown, but it is nowhere near the growth in value. I think that new money needs to be added to see something described as a bubble, and I think the only likely way that could happen is if institutional investors jump on board or it happens much later after a lot more new users are in (maybe 12 months, at least 6).

You were the one implying bitcoin is as invincible as the internet. I was trying to show that even if I accepted your premise (which is not correct) it is still within the governments control to collapse the bitcoin market. It's a little tricky to debate on reddit but from what I gather you are arguing the internet is bitcoin's weakest link. This is simply not the case, it's one of the strongest links in it's chain, you need to look at the weakest links, like needing bank transactions, exchanges, and registered businesses to make bitcoin function well.

Isn't that the exact same thing as a Market Cap? Companies get a chunk of money at the IPO (which could be an insignificant amount compared to their future market cap) and hoard the rest. It's all based on the last paid price, not a fundamental value judgement. If apple jumped in price because some fancy Ipad came out and their stock value goes up 20%, you wouldn't then argue that since only a few percent of shares were sold at this new price that therefore the market cap wasn't 20% greater. Obviously the bitcoin hording appears suspicious and extreme, but people act the exact same way with stocks without challenging the term market capitalization.

has a good point, I like watching Stefan but he makes unbacked assumptions all the time. 
Examples: Bitcoin doesn't stop fractional reserve banking, it may take a while to convince people, but they did it all the time with gold. Also, the productive capacity of a nation is not limited by fiat currency, it is limited by human labor and natural resources. That is a very Neo-Keynesian idea. (although I agree inflating the money supply is probably the easiest way to steal the productive capacity of the citizens, it is by no means the only way)

The ability for a court to request information is very important. Right or wrong, information needs to be available to make decisions. It's a fundamental power of the court. Even a anarchistic society would desire a set up that allows for the exposure of all relevant information for a court decision.

Haters are missing the significance of the dates chosen, which is a purchase at a local maximum and selling today at a local minimum. Buying at the peak of a bubble (or correction) is one of the worst purchases you can make. If you applied the same bias in date selection with Tesela, you would have an october $190 purchase with an april sell $205, netting you a &lt;10% gain. The fact that it is exactly a year ago is not the most significant point, it just ties it together nicely.
And of course, if someone did buy a bitcoin at $260 last year and held, it is probable that it is their top purchase of the year even with such poor timing and all the negative news.

The problem with these conversations is that there are two parties disagreeing on the magnitude of the risk.
I understand why bitcoin could go to 0, I don't understand the inherent assumption that cryptocurrencies have no place in the future, or that if they do, there is a near 0% chance that bitcoin will be a part of it. If the two parties can't even see eye-to-eye on that point and no one is discussing that point, then there is no reason to have a conversation.
Saying how much things looks like a bubble or a mania is not overwhelming evidence, it's a useful heuristic. Even the Fed openly admits it can't see bubbles until they pop. You may think I am ignorant to think the heuristic is flawed when applied to bitcoin, but I think the evidence is overwhelming that there is at least a chance and I am going to leave it at that.

The fee structure will adjust to ensure the network is secure with sufficient mining. It can be considerably higher in the future, but still cheaper than any current method for remittance or credit card usage. But, yeah, I have never found a good answer on that question, from all that I can tell it assumes there will be much much more users in the future (in which case miners won't disappear) or that hashing can be lower without risking security.
Cost of ASICs applies to both the miners and the attacker, so does the price of electricity. The network is designed to incentivize a preference of mining over an attack, no rational being would choose to attack, but if an entity wants to destroy the network a 51% attack wouldn't work because at 51% is not a magic super power (

News Flash: Just because there isn't an agreed definition of something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It is what everyone is attempting to measure when they use GDP, an easily measured statistic. Did you prefer I say a combination of a weighted score for GDP and a collection of other measures to approximate the value of the production of the economy (inflation adjusted of course, whatever the hell that means these days)? Just so we are clear, that thing, whatever you want to call it, is not dependent on the number of dollars floating around.

Although misleading, it does show some useful information. At worst **the sales appear to be staying in China**. I don't follow the site so maybe I haven't watched long enough, but if there was a serious sell off in China, it would show as more purchases in foreign countries than usual, and not Yuan.

I already explained. It's deceptive, and this entity has a lot of power because of the number of bitcoins owned. I just think the bitcoin community should strive to be open and transparent, whenever important facts are hidden or glossed over in financial markets it's usually a bad sign. It's hard to trust someone when they won't backup their greatest experiment ever with a real identity, and I think people (unintentionally) gloss over that fact by using the fake Japanese name.

If you are not in it for the speculation (future potential value) or the ideology, then you should avoid holding bitcoin, you are taking on unnecessary risk without expecting any payoff. Wait a year or 2 when things settle down, and there will be a properly functioning internet currency, now is not the time.
Any action counter to this indicates that you are in fact influenced by some level of speculation or ideology.

The sunk cost of the mining equipment not relevant for this example. We are to just considering the operating cost, which is what would happen if the price drops. No one would run a machine unless it was generating income, if it cost more in electricity to run than the reward was worth they would simply turn off the machine.

Deflationary Spiral is a made up thing. If you actually look for justifications for inflation over deflation by people in the field they never allude to this theory. It's as likely to occur in reverse as an "Inflationary Spiral", but no one talks about dumping their cash because the value of cash is dropping 2-3% a year (and guaranteed to do so by central banks).
If you think about it, it's technically less likely to occur than an inflationary one since you have to spend your money to survive, so with deflation there is a point were you are obligated to spend, where the reverse would not be true in the presence of high inflation.

No need to be so angry. You regret not buying in at $20 a btc or something? The societal collapse argument is the straw argument from the other speaker, not the original posts. There are plenty of people that think the US and it's currency is unsustainable, and at times it seems to that the people that love the economy in its current form are the same people that couldn't call the financial crisis as it unravelled right in front of their eyes. So we could me wrong, but at least we don't place our faith with people that have failed with impunity and in many cases actively fought against the general populations best interest. As long as you put your faith in the "guaranteed to lose 2% a year" US currency, you prop up and technically fund this system.

It's literally not zero-sum though. Not that that is terribly relevant to the logic of the post. Market cap is determined by the current bid/ask price, not the total amount of money put into it. What is important though is that the value you get by selling is not lost by the receiver, we can safely assume both parties benefited, which is why the trade took place. However, if we assume people are only buying due to speculation, then it really depends on when the receiver sells and what the intrinsic value of the bitcoin really is.
edit: If we assume the intrinsic value is zero, and that it will inevitably return to this price, then it is a zero-sum game (actually, negative sum due to the electricity costs, but close enough for the sake of this assessment)

I actually agree with you, too much hate, sometimes I got the impression that everyone on this form dumped it in the first month which is why they hated it so much. I do think ABC will pump but only because they obviously manipulate the shit out of BCH (Any coin that randomly and dramatically spikes up and slowly comes back down over the period of a month or two is a huge red flag for pump-and-dump manipulation)
@_date: 2018-03-05 05:59:51
Not to be a stickler but the last point is not true. You're assuming a sale during a peak. If one were proactive they would have probably dumped Bcash between 0.15 to 0.05. It's currently at 0.11 so the poster is not doing too bad. No one would have held though the 0.05 trough in the hopes that it would repump. For bitcoin gold you are cherry picking a price too. I'm not sure about the other forks but I'm guessing similar numbers there and they are substantially smaller. Only people that were able to capitalize on those later gains are people that either held off because they were lazy or because they originally decided to hold.
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:13:59
Margin traders long on BTC either got liquidated, which means they will only be able to trade a fraction of what they use to trade (left with maybe 15-30% of what they originally owned) or are dramatically more cautious after seeing that the prior trend of "no more than a 50% crash" is no longer true. They still lost money, and they still have removed a lot of money from the market. And these are the "weak hands" everyone is talking about because they either have a stop loss, which is a price they will sell their position at which is lower than the current price, or they have a liquidation price, which is also a lower price they will sell at.
This includes both the people that just go long on margin and swing traders alike.
It's easier to say "broke" in a colloquial sense than to say "so little money that they stopped trading or dramatically curbed the amount of leverage they put in trades and also for the people with shallow stop losses, they will also be less inclined to invest". Sometimes when you speak, you use implied phrases that everyone understands because it is difficult to constantly restate what you just said in a prior paragraph. It's almost as though you didn't read what I wrote. What was the point of critiquing the conclusion when you didn't read any of the premises?
@_date: 2018-02-17 05:29:26
Implied in the comment is that if you made a good bet they keep the difference and if you made a bad bet they make you eat the loss,  they just choose the prices that benefit them the most in a 24h period. However, there is not enough information in the experience to prove this point, only that it is possible.
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:19:48
All these exceptions people keep stating are irrelevant and are neither necessary nor sufficient for fiat money. It's clearly a fiat currency based on colloquial usage of the word (not backed by anything, demand related to what someone is willing exchange for it). If one uses the literal definition it is actually less than fiat. It is less backed than most fiat currencies since most countries require taxes paid in their currency, have specific laws obligating trade to be paid in said currency, and in the case on some countries, giant militaries that shoot people if their markets are disrupted. The benefits of bitcoin have nothing to do with the lack of "fiat-ness" espoused by its fans. It lacks the ability for it to be printed infinitely, and that's great, but it's not a defining property of fiat or non-fiat

It would be easier and cheaper to just have an extension that transfers bitcoins. Using your GPU to mine bitcoins is dramatically more expensive than current mining techniques. You would be spending a lot more on electricity than you would just buying bitcoin and sending it over.
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:08:44
The velocity of money will never slow down in the way you describe. This is how supply and demand work in an efficient market. As demand for currency increases (due to expiring bonds) the value rises, people that have currency will want to get rid of overvalued currency because they know it is an artificial effect of a large number of bonds expiring simultaneously. If I told you your money is worth 20% more this month, but only this month, you'd go out and spend it. No dumb ass would say... "well, maybe a bubble will form and I can get out at a higher level" . Also keep in mind it doesnt take all year to pay a debt, it takes 6 confirmations or 1h, so this surge in demand for money would not have a general effect over the whole year. Yes there is a theoretical upper limit of what can be loaned out, no it does not grow into infinity, It has an upper and lower bound.
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:30:51
It's amazing, not a single good ancap argument in this whole thread. The argument OP posed is the "math says inflation must exist". It's actually the generic anti-deflationary currency argument. It sounds convincing but is only possible is a reality where all the money is loaned out and all the money is being called on simultaneously.  All other cases form a stable equilibrium of loans and currency .

@_date: 2018-04-06 02:55:49
I don't agree with this assumption, people are more likely to cash out their bitcoins once they have enough money to never work a day in their life, so the upper bounds for a rational actor is probably 10 million dollars worth of bitcoin, and that's being very generous. There are very few people that will continue to hold to double down on the bet. This is not the case with normal currency, where the conservative position is to just hold a cash position in the currency. I image the only people with super large holdings are people that accidently/unintentionally held, or have such large positions they fear they will scare the market, or are ex-drug dealers that are nervous about washing coins.

Yes, you can still be angry, is doing the usual "reddit contrarian" argument, and while I love a good contrarian argument, this one lacks the depth required for a proper proof (and as I will demonstrate, the argument is invalid). Malice behaviour is detrimental to any economic system, contrary to those people that hate libertarians, libertarians don't celebrate an "anything goes policy", libertarians celebrate free-market solutions that people voluntarily abide by.
Anything that interferes with a free market is actually very dangerous to libertarians, probably more so than it is to a system that can fall back on a powerful state government. In this case, Roger Ver is intentionally misleading newcomers or people naive to the crypto space. If Roger Ver was merely making another variation/altcoin, then Cthulhooo would be correct. This however, is not the case, Ver is (a) attempting to steal a brand, and (b) is doing this by intentionally misleading people. BCH forked from BTC, BTC still has the developers from before the fork, and there is a strong consensus among the community on which is the true bitcoin*.
These malicious behaviours are in violation of free markets, you can't have a free market where fraud is acceptable and where you can't grow a reputation because people steal brands and identities. Free markets only work were there are the actors are rational, and the actors have good information (hopefully this point is intuitive to most readers, I don't have space to flesh this out without creating a 10 page essay). The typical libertarian solution to fraud is civil law, and in cases where offence is too mild to bring a law suit, it's seen as acceptable to use social pressures.
It's also absolutely foundational that people speak up and say something or the fraud will continue and will get worse, so the "You can but it's not gonna change anything" response proves to me that this person has not actually considered the problem in depth. It is clearly a bad thing to have this issue going on, and it is important to do something about it. If being angry motivates you to write a post or act in a way that will better the situation, then be angry.
*To further this point, in case someone reading this sides with Ver, that BCH is the true bitcoin: If I make a new currency called "the true American dollar" and I made it out of gold and silver (as per the constitution), I may be correct to say this is more closely aligned to what the founding fathers defined as money, but you bet your ass the US government would be coming after me for calling it an American dollar, and if I tricked someone into taking it, they would be rightfully upset if they were expecting actual American dollars. Here's another example: Anyone can fork the major currency and claim they are following it most closely to the white paper, what validates one claim over the other? It's the back end, the developers, the community, and the progression of a continuous project. BCH has an early adopter that claims he is better at following a white paper, contrary to the vast majority of other early adopters.

Meh, peak to trough isn't really a drop. Besides 20% is my minimum. I'm honestly surprised how much people talk about these fluctuations, but then again, maybe most of the people have bought in a lot later and aren't use to it. Then again, it's Reddit, not much else to talk about I suppose.
