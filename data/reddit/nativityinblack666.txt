Not really, but I'd rather not throw it away if BTC isn't going to rise back to the 20k region
@_date: 2018-09-10 13:39:08
I'm on the fence as to whether I should buy £100 worth of btc
@_date: 2018-09-14 12:47:29
How much was in it
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:36:29
Recognised as currency?
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:55:41
Last time someone used nicehash?
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:24:05
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:44:51
Oh sorry, I see the confusion. Nicehash miner*
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:12:54
could i mine bitcoin though?
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:44:59
I'm going to use nicehash
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:09:08
...there's nothing to rob
@_date: 2018-05-15 06:35:09
How can they Rob me if I don't put any money into it
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:53:00
Could you recommend a pool?
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:56:37
Yeah I'll just Google "what happened the last time literally anyone downloaded and used nicehash"
@_date: 2018-05-14 19:21:39
Pool mining seems like the best option
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:05:18
It's not going to 50k.
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:34:29
No im saying it won't reach 50k
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:52:54
They know de wai
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:10:27
People selling are idiots with no commitment, it's dipped before and it rose up higher than before. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:49:11
The cringe
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:13:07
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:48:54
Find me someone who does, looking at the past trends and rises and falls I can make the accurate estimation that it won't hit 50k. That's a stupid figure
@_date: 2018-06-19 12:02:23
I mean, technically you run the most northerly bitcoin node as the earth's polarity is actually the opposite of what is widely accepted today
@_date: 2018-06-30 12:24:31
Not 50k in the next 5 months
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:26:02
When was bitcoin at 18k?
@_date: 2018-06-24 11:50:53
Too bad the prices are shit atm hopefully people will be repayed in a few months
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:04:14
I meant it's a good thing the prices are low
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:13:18
The reason it's so valuable is because of people treating it like a trade asset, it's constantly compared with gold-based currencies rather than being compared with how many pizzas you can buy with it.
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:54:21
As long as it's more than the cost to mine it it's fine
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:26:11
Well you certainly weren't against the idea and it's currently just under £5k. Have fun burning your savings cuz it's in the shitter
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:43:55
Well we're nearing the end of the year and bitcoin hasn't hit anywhere near 50k yet, in fact its still under 1/10 of that figure.
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:22:27
Relative to what? That cookie is probably a decade old lmao
@_date: 2019-01-17 13:17:19
For a short term? It's been treated like a stock since it blew up and one of the reasons it blew up was because it was treated like a stock, the average person doesn't see the benefit of a mainstream cryptocurrency, especially one as unstable as bitcoin. Could you imagine if we had a worldwide crypto that was accepted globally and it crashed as bad as this? The world would be in anarchy
@_date: 2019-01-16 18:21:04
The statement is still true
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:04:38
And what conversion formula are you using for $ to lb?
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:45:43
I understand the technology and *blockchain* will be revolutionary. Bitcoin however, has failed as people are too dumb to accept it because they cant hold it in their hands
@_date: 2019-01-16 16:37:44
This is like congratulating a 700lb man who lost 600lb in 6 years and then spent the next 4 years gaining 400lb
@_date: 2019-01-17 11:00:33
What? Oh you think I'm talking about proven wrong about how much money they can make out of it, well that's naive..
Bitcoin as an alternative currency has failed and you can argue that. As for the "original idea" stick, what kind of original idea is buying and selling what is essentially a stock for prospects of profit? people have been doing it since the 1700s
@_date: 2019-01-16 18:16:00
Why not?
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:09:20
Yeah your argument that I'm dumb isn't really working and just shows that you don't really have a counter
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:06:29
It went to 20k and now it's crashing, If you are buying now you're an idiot
@_date: 2019-01-17 15:26:12
The whole point of currency is that it's compared to goods. currency has no value, it *represents* value. If a currency this unstable was used worldwide you could order a meal and have it cost more than when you ordered it by the time you've finished it
@_date: 2019-01-16 16:38:15
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:19:26
No one has ever been proved wrong, it's gone from 20k to 3k, theres optimism and then there's stupidity
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:01:46
I read it the other day, trolling through his/her/their forum posts is pretty insightful too
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:56:05
Bitcoin is not hard money, thats the point ;)
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:57:12
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:53:37
Bitcoin is valued in anything, I don't have a 'kind' and I wasn't against it reaching 20k I just think it's had its day and it's not going to rise back up, especially not to 50k in the next 2 months. You better sell now if you want to make any kind of profit
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:10:02
I'm talking about the posts from the P2P forum
@_date: 2018-12-06 08:51:36
Still holding it and it's worth significantly less
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:07:19
I was gonna say that people say shit like that in the context of believing that it will shoot back up but you covered that
