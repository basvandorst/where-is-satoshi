I haven't done that so I can't tell, but do you have to still pay the fixed $0.15 fee (if my memory serves..)?  If so, you may be better off making weekly or monthly purchases, imho.

You could use the faucets found at coinbox.me and bitchest.me.  They won't give you a lot, but hey it's something.

I'd prefer to see pools set up by private companies, like Apple and Google.  With enough companies, that should split their fanbases enough to help fight any 51% attacks.
My issue with government-run pools is where they would come up with the money/bitcoin to give out incentives?  Since the US is already spread so thin with wars and foreign aid, Italy and Greece fighting their own battles, this would not be feasible.  Also, I would imagine the "incentive" would be eventually taxed since I assume any gov't pool would keep track of its users who aren't savvy enough for TOR or another way to keep anonymity.

For a faucet, I've been using Coinbox.me
Coinbox has links to quite a few faucets where you can get 20-80 satoshis per 30 minutes, so if you fill out the captchas 10 times (5 hours/day), you can get a little over 5000 satoshis, which is enough for Coinbox to transfer to your wallet.
For me, Coinbox has only allowed blockchain.info wallets.  It'll take a while to accrue enough to transfer to a cold wallet, since the transfer fee is 10,000 satoshis. :/  At the current price, it's about $0.04/day.

An index fund would invest in all available cryptocurrencies by their market cap (or equal weighting).  There is no "picking" of currencies over others in an index fund.  Picking of currencies would make it either a hedge fund or an actively-managed mutual fund.

Thanks for the post.  This same thing happened to me this week but on BVC.  I started the week on a good winning streak, tripling my initial investment.  Then on Thursday night, I lost it all.  On Friday, I saw that a  small BTC order arrived in my Coinbase account so I thought I'd try my luck with that.  I was betting with 97% win chance and somehow ended up blowing that, too.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:56:24
First, now that I think of it, BTC could be the mana.
I'd put a picture of a prominent bank whose stance on bitcoin changed and started closing accounts.  For the text, I think something that conveys the message that the target mana (BTC) card cannot be played this turn and instead, it goes back to player's hand or graveyard.
Or...mana still be BTC, and the interrupt/instant bank card targets a permanent (bank account).  For the text, perhaps say something  about target permanent (bank account) be destroyed and the mana (BTC) used also goes into the graveyard.

You have to wait until Friday. If you go through the process of verifying a credit card and some additional personal information, the buying process can be done "in seconds" rather than 4+ days....I haven't done this personally, though.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:51:56
Also make sure that you take the fees and the price spread in to account.  IE:  Say you buy at $650 less fees.  If you sell immediately, you won't get $650, but it'll be closer to $647 before fees.  In this hypothetical situation, you'll need the price at selling to be closer to $655.
