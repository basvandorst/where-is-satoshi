Didn't get a chance to reuse the vegeta memes lol. That was probably the only chance in history for Bitgeta

I didn't like you at first but that's a pretty nice couple paragraphs there. Kudos!

If you're getting paid in bitcoin and you're upset because instead of $20k/btc you're getting $12k...my guess is you'll be fine. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:50:35
Oof. Also upvoted.. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:31:33
Oh no, foiled by the Reimann Zeta function  again... Aint that just the plum dickens, I tell you hwat. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:31:09
Just saying.. 100% would be $0, big difference from $12k

If you can wait until April, LIFEcard looks promising. Pick up some lifetokens too lol 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:25:54
Maybe, chekt?

I call it the "poor person's fee".
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:20:02
Would you say the same for wheresgeorge.com?
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:01:17
This is a great idea lol
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:48:10
I watched it thinking it was going to be how bitcoin is a government conspiracy, but proved to be an informative video. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:22:23
Lol you mean 50% from ATH? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:55:18
So it's basically just sheep who are annoying. Got it loud and clear ;)

The price is an effect, the tech is the cause. Unless we're talking about hysterisis, cause precedes effect.

"a weak dollar is good for trade"... Excuse me but what? This seems counterintuitive. Doesn't that mean that it takes more USD to exchange goods and services? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:00:57
Lol that's a nice dream you have there. As others have said 
1. Difficulty is very high
2. You'll kill your phone for less money than the phone costs
3. Decentralized nature dictates that all software relies on people taking on the projects that you are looking for,  and main humanpower is going to getting the thing working as well as it can at the moment.
Learn how to mine some altcoins, maybe like Monero or vertcoin. And not minergate either. Like learn how to create a runme.bat (not hard, just text, plenty of resources and videos on the internet). This skill will be infinitely more rewarding than anything on the McDonalds menu lol
Edit: spelling

Lol ok my dude. Bitcoin''s code was written by someone who wasn't too lazy to figure out how it works to create it,  and you want to try to poke holes in it from your la-z-boy? This subreddit is incredible sometimes. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:29:55
Not the worst, definitely entertaining 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:02:18
I think that Bitcoin will solve this problem in the long run. Governments get their power and control through money. If the money is decentralized then the government will either be forced to play fair, or stop existing completely IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:21:41
Bitcoin inflates like a Kamifusen
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:09:22
You're in bitcoin for the price movement? Gtfo imo. You want a rush? Buy some coke.  This is about empowering people not about your personal jollies. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:51:09
I think it's something new. To reduce it to existing terms and trying to peg it within old boundaries isn't working. Unfortunately, language has to evolve to express what it is and means to its fullest extent, but in the meantime people have to argue their points in an evolving language space, which means using inaccurate terms for the time being for the purpose of accurate language discovery.

Also closed my coinbase account. Opened on Gemini but haven't tried using it yet 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:50:53
This is why I love bitcoin. You can't just call up some customer service rep,  yell at him for a little while and totally ruin this person's day for a problem that includes but isn't limited to a mistake you made or something obscenely obvious. 
Long live independence and deductive reasoning!
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:35:37
Learn to read satoshi,  also when you get into bigger numbers you can think in terms of percentage of the bitcoin  price ATM. So 7740 satoshi maybe be equal to 1 USD, and .01 btc is 1% of the current price of btc. 
If you can't be bothered to try and do this then stop complaining. Git gud. Satoshi is universal, fiat is regional. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:44:04
Oh for Christ's-- you used the term store of value, whether there is a "not" in front of it or not is inconsequential,  you referenced the term in conjunction with bitcoin -- a point which is still moot after my previous comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:19:06
I'm too lazy to type it all out.  I'm interested in helping, but not interested enough in wasting my time to explain to someone who won't find the answers for themselves. I'd rather put time elsewhere. I hope you don't rattle these "flaws" off in conversation like they're fact. 
Also: name checks out. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:13:36
This is the most useful flowchart ever invented. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:21:59
None, which is my point? New innovation, new rules. Don't try to apply old rules to a new game. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:07:17
A store of value that isn't completely blossomed/mined yet. Expect volatility during acceptance, expect volatility during adoption,  expect stability upon market maturation. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:20:56
I think you're right in that it's very hard to lose out on making money right now with the correct investment decisions. 
However, why cash out when the world accepts crypto payments in the future that is being built at the moment =) HODL until fiat = 0 then there's no cash out needed
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:17:04
Proof of "every time txs under 170k, 30 min blocks" argument plz. Screenshots will work. Support your theory 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:05:54
Oh cool, can you tell him I still have his wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:26:25
Like send bitcoin to a bitcoin cash wallet the day of the fork, realize they're stuck, try to import the wallet via private keys but you can't cuz wallet is already I  the app, then delete the private keys causing all hope of getting them back to be lost. 
Newbie mistakes. Good times lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:35:35
Pretty effective attack. Soon it won't be though =)
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:42:41
Agreed. I especially love the supporting evidence and sources. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:40:58
^This is the video. Everyone calls Bitcoin a bubble, as it looks like one. But it is more robust than a true bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:57:02
Congrats! I literally just did the same thing! Good luck 
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:29:29
You called it a store of value, I'm using terms you used to make my point. 
No need to argue your point though, this seems to be a continued crossroads between those who see what crypto has to offer and those who question what crypto has to offer. There are no winners in this type of disagreement so far and both are correct in their own contexts. Time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:49:41
Aaawwww yeaaa. "The more decentralized chain will get an endorsement", do you think that's what that twitter guy was talking about?
@_date: 2018-03-11 06:33:50
Post this is you'll change no minds lol
