So this would be a better way to invest? What is profit looking like for this?

What I'm saying is, that this has got me interested in learning more about Bitcoin because before I completely dismissed it as it sounded a bit crazy.
And what I've been learning from people posting on my question, has really got me interested. I mean this is fascinating the technology is, to me at least, beautiful.
I mention the money because I never would have even looked into it if that didn't happen.

Don't worry you don't sound like a jerk. And I have been reading it's just that I don't exactly know what to look for when researching. I'm just coupling Reddit with my own research, I'm obviously not trusting what I'm going to do my money with strangers on the internet. Now that that's out of the way, what should I do with my money?
But seriously, do you think that Bitcoin being stopped is in any way a likely thing to happen in the future? I have bought a Bitcoin a while back and it cost around €300 so it peaked my interest when I found out it was now worth over 400.

Okay, makes more sense now. Thanks as well.

Any hints on how I should invest? Decided I want to have a more active way of paying for college than loans.

Okay, yeah I've always known there's risk investing in something like this, but as you said the potential for an upside is far greater than a downside. 
I'm asking this because I had the chance back in 2010 to buy 100 and didn't take it because I thought it would flop.
Where should I look to buy, I was thinking Kraken or Coinbase.

It was either that or go hungry, any other suggestions on how I could learn about this? I'm all ears.

Well I'd be a tad wealthier right now if I had bought the 100 in 2010
