It would be nice if a person could start with bitcoin without having to have bitcoin first. Bitsquare seems great, but the big barrier is that you still have to sign up for an exchange, get your 0.011 BTC (security deposite 0.01 + 0.001 BTC when taking an offer).
Would it possible to have an option of max 0.015 BTC buying without security deposit so user's can get started? This would mean that some sellers can choose to offer this amount for starters, risking losing it if the new comer doesn't pay up, but can ask for a bit more than the current BTC value. This would remove the step-in barrier.

Not necessary much more. You can for example give the option to sellers that the beginner amount is locked away with a security deposit of 0.02 BTC. Then the beginner transfers the real cash and when the seller receives it, he can transfer the money with help of an arbitrator (the seller paying both the small fee of creating and taking the offer).
If the beginner buyer doesn't transfer the money, nothing happens. When the beginner buyer pays the money and the seller transfers it, the arbitrator releases the money. When the beginner buyer payed, but the seller claims he didn't receive (even though he did). The 1st time the buyer will be believed, but the money will still be locked. When a 2nd beginner buyer wants to buy this locked BTC and transfers the money and the seller again claims nothing received, the seller will be tagged as a deceiver. The arbitrator takes the security deposit and gives 0.015 BTC from that to the 1st first time buyer and the locked 0.015 BTC to the 2nd beginner buyer (so assumption is now that both the beginner buyers were honest).
TL;DR: Seller for beginner 0.015 BTC is locked away until a beginner buyer claims it (with 0.02 security deposit). Seller pays for both creating and taking offer fee, but can ask for a higher than market price. If buyer doesn't transfer anything, no problem. If buyer transfers and seller gives BTC, everything is ok. If seller claims 2 times nothing received, but the multiple buyers have proof, the 0.02 security deposit and locked 0.015 BTC is used to pay both beginner buyers.
Edit: A better worded version of this suggestion on the bitsquare forum:

It was an error by the bank: 
Quick translation: "ABN Amro had temporary a page online where customers could show if they had interest in a bitcoinwallet supervised inside a secured surrounding of the bank. The page is taken offline.
According to Ariën Bikker it was about a project from the Innovation Centre from ABN Amro that was busy with this a few years ago, but has been shut down a long time ago. Why is suddenly came online, is still under investigation of the bank.

Isn't 0.01 bitcoin not a bit much though? That is around €6, which is more than a local bank transfer, which also has to be add to the total cost. I thought bitcoin was supposed to be cheaper than banking systems. And with most transfer going without problem, that's quite a lot for little effort with all those transactions.
Is this price going to be changed when BitSquare will grow? As in for now it's just to earn a bit back on the investment cost?

I was talking about this part of the FAQ: 
"The arbitrator will side with buyer or seller and sign the 2-of-3 multisignature address in favor of the appropriate party. The arbitrator keeps the errant trader’s 0.01 BTC security deposit as payment for her service."
Or is this only the case when there is a dispute between the buyer and seller? Meaning that without problems 0.0015 BTC is paid to Bitsquare's arbitrators and 0.0115 BTC if there is some problem?

A thanks for the clarification, now it makes sense where that "0.01 BTC security deposit as payment for her service" comes from. Maybe it would be better to combine this information in the FAQ instead of 2 separate questions.

Any plans to support the yen in the near future?
