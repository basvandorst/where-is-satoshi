People will just build stuff in the middle of nowhere without access, clearly.

Then why are you still here looking back? To tell everyone how much smarter you are? Bye!

It's an expression Mexicans use to express strong agreement. It's kind of like FUCK YEAH. A HUEVO! Note that it's not considered formal/classy.

Yes, every shy person with technology-related hobbies probably has autism.

Well, the reporter did prove irrefutably that this man is Satoshi Nakamoto, just not that he's *the* Satoshi Nakamoto.

The cool thing is there is already precedent for mobile money in Africa.

Kind of odd that on the cusp of the price correcting itself upwards with all the good news about square we get this coinbase scandal. What impeccable timing for someone that wants to keep the price low.

This is starting to look like the fucking future. I can book a flight to Holland with bitcoin(cheapair), and then eat and drink at the Hague with just the bitcoin wallet on my android phone. If I could get a hotel/hostel room and a taxi then it would complete one of the visions of bitcoin. Once it comes full circle, that means:
*No need to obtain euros before travelling
*No taking a single dollar out to exchange at a currency exchange 
*No foreign transaction fees on my debit/credit card
 
*No having to call my bank/credit cards ahead of time and put in a travel notice. 
*No fear of my card declining as fraud protection
*No leftover euros that I have to exchange back for dollars at another loss 
This is what it's about. A transatlantic round trip without currency exchange! Forget getting rich quick, this is huge!

Any plans to add Prosecco in the future? Any plans to sell by less than a case at a time?

What's crazy is it's been five years and it hasn't gone the way of liberty dollars or e-gold. No wonder satoshi hasn't revealed himself.
