Well it was a gamble. 45% of people who put their money on the roulette wheel, on red, don't regret it either.

It's because of the announcement of bitcoin trading on CME

Yeah but litecoin has a shitty name. It never would have caught on without bitcoin to ride on.

I too live in a bitcoin.

People aren't always rational actors. If they were there would never have been any bubbles in the first place.

You're supposed to get the money to buy the dip by selling the peak, scrubs.

That guy dropped off the face of the earth afterwards. But he was a bitcoin early adopter. I sort of suspect that he still has plenty of it left and is enjoying his private island right now.

Yeah, the biggest benefit of leasing panels is that no solar installer will scam you by installing panels at an unfavorable orientation. Since they benefit from your electricity generation, they would just have rejected your house outright.

Depends what you mean by "not investing". Keeping your assets as cash, or in a checking account, you will surely lose capital through inflation. Keeping it in gold, land, or other durable commodities, it will probably stay around the same value, or maybe go up a bit but you never know.  The best odds of gaining a return on investment in the long run is always to put your money on some kind of productive asset, such as real estate, a farm, or stocks.

The inventors of bitcoin are rich. Why do they care about the consequences?
