Didn’t you know? On any CC subreddit, anything negative to do with fiat money is equal to cryptocurrency news. It doesn’t even have to be relative or make sense.

No, and you, like most of these bitcoin cowboys running around, have no clue of economic history. Ever heard of the “Great Depression”? Financial crises occur like once a generation. They’re not new. The world is still turning. Life continues. One could occur tomorrow and the masses still wouldn’t give two fucks about bitcoin.

There wasn’t an argument to be made. Like I said, you do not know history, but ‘08 should have at least taught you that governments and other governments of other countries will bail banks out whenever needed. If they didn’t, rich fuckers would. They would lend to countries, buy national debt, and assert their authority how and when they wish. Read the story about the Elliott Capital and the Argentine government.
Now, understand this: the value of money is imaginary, which means it can’t actually be destroyed. It would just be transferred, and it will simply be transferred to something else within a government’s control, and the world would continue to turn.
There will never be a time when every bank and financial institution fails because it is not an actual possibility. As long as physical resources exist, so does currency, and value will be applied to whatever is in vast quantity. A cryptocurrency will not take the place of a fiat currency because it cannot be backed up by the physical, and in a world of global financial catastrophe akin to the nature of what you put forth, what value will a digital currency have when infrastructure collapses and people can’t access the currency anyway? Hell, at least they can grow and trade corn and wheat.

All of this is why I stated “especially if the owner is not a moron”.
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:13:38
Non-confiscatable? Tell that to the people who have been arrested and had their wallets and coins seized. It’s harder to confiscate cryptocurrency, especially if the owner isn’t a moron, but it’s not impossible because, physical or not, currency still has to exist somewhere, and digital currency, where ever it is stored, can still be taken via hacking and hardware confiscation. Blockchain itself may be secure (for now) but the currency is up for grabs just like paper money. Only the methods of acquisition (somewhat) vary.

The volatility of all cryptocurrencies is based on the fact that none have anything to stabilise them. They aren’t linked to anything that has a determinable real world value in any way, and the coins themselves do not. Stability in the value of any currency has to be based on something that can be traded, excluding currency itself. Crypto is used for buying, but a problems exists here, too. The knowledge of said pricing  has to be public - private selling does not help at all because you can’t determine any general price of X item around which to create stability, and crypto is generally based on private sales for now. It won’t stabilise until enough trading is done in the public eye through legitimate services such as online stores - and a large number of them, at that. It doesn’t matter if every member of the public gets into crypto, the price will continue to jump and sink until a ton of businesses get involved and create a “general consensus” in terms of crypto value that everyone can see and many agree with.
It also doesn’t help that many people are holding onto it in the hopes of making money. Currency that isn’t being traded is detrimental to its survival anyway, and prolongs the time it would take to stabilise.

You don’t completely understand what a bubble is or how it works. No bubble makes a technology valueless, nor can bitcoin itself be a bubble. A bubble is overinflated pricing in regards to a sector. *Blockchain/cryptocurrency* is a bubble - do you really think all of these cryptocurrencies will survive and maintain these stupidly high values attained with zero proof of long-term viability - not in the technology, but in the coin itself? These bubbles only occur because of overexcited, greedy investor gambling - a lot of investors have already lost money, and many more will. By the end of it, as with the web bubble of late 90s and early 00s, most investment will be lost, most companies vaporised, and only a handful of currencies surviving. That will set the stage for standardising blockchain tech and any token valuations based on how a company operates.
Right now, the cryptocurrency space is the Wild West and anyone with a gun (coin) can get involved, so no one knows anything in regards to what will happen and it is bubbling - this is why 99%+ of predictions have been completely wrong. Anyone who says otherwise is ignorant to the nature of how these things rise and fall.
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:33:45
It can, *solely* because of complete decentralisation. Coins with companies and figureheads are the ones most volatile because they can be tanked due to the actions of those involved, even when those actions have nothing to do with the coin. Sexual harassment scandal? Reflects bad on the company, reflects bad on the coin. Company fails? Bye-bye coin.

Well, I guess the answer to your show title is a definitive “no”. 
On the bright side, it will most likely make for a more entertaining show than if the answer was yes, so, you know, *every cloud has a bitcoin lining*, unless you’re in Madrid where they’d still prefer silver.

How circumstantial it is is irrelevant - circumstances occur. Also, I never specified from your pocket. It could have been stolen from your bank account, and it could be recovered from another account, or banking insurance could come into play. If your bitcoin is stolen, it’s far less likely that you’ll get it back. Besides, even though bitcoin isn’t completely anonymous, someone smart enough to steal bitcoin is going to move the money around first, or withdraw it, or use an address that can’t be identified, and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. I’m not saying all criminals are as smart, but being smart enough to steal bitcoin, short of holding a gun to someone’s head and making them transfer it, probably means you the thieves are smart enough to know how to get away with it.

But it doesn’t. Appealing to authority is not equivalent to taking from authority.

Lmao, nah dude, you just wish to make out as though they failed previously and are failing now, again, by not backing crypto like you want them to. I wasn’t wrong in the slightest, you just need to do everything you can to boost the speculation on crypto and get a price jump by claiming “these guys failed before with x y and z, and they’re failing now with crypto!”
Nice try, though. You should take a better look at history before you come here talking shit. People like you are the ones who will argue that someone was dumb and failed, all while they walk away with $50million and new vacation home. Yes, great example of failure. I wouldn’t mind failing like that.

If your fiat money gets stolen, you have a legal course of action to get your money back and/or have the thieves incarcerated. If your bitcoin gets stolen, you’re fucked and you won’t even know who did it.
@_date: 2018-07-05 16:40:08
I never said it was because of the type of currency itself. Currency itself means nothing. The system that governs the currency is what matters, and those laws and agreements are what make fiat safer.
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:52:23
That’s not true whatsoever. You can get court-awarded compensation for being the victim of any crime, which is paid for by the criminal. You can also have your money returned if the thief is caught with money in their possession - it doesn’t have to be the precise notes stolen from you.
And banks are not the same as exchanges, so bank accounts are not the same as exchange accounts.
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:28:38
It’s funny that pickpocketing is the only example anyone brings up. Do you keep bitcoin in your pocket? You keep it in a digital wallet, no? Something like a bank account, no?

Recovering something doesn’t change the fact it wasn’t stolen in the first place. Dumbest reply you could’ve made.
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:18:31
If you get robbed of 1mil in bitcoin from your wallet, through no fault of your own, and none of it is recovered, how much bitcoin do you have? Zero.
If you get robbed of 1mil in fiat from your bank account, through no fault of your own, and none of it is recovered, how much fiat do you have? Well, that depends. Banks have insurance for such situations, so you may not get back the full 1mil, but you’ll have more fiat than you would bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:33:17
Who said you magically get your money back? I didn’t. I said there are things you can do. YOU started all this magic money bullshit (yea I saw the /s comment before you edited it). The FACT of the matter is that it’s safer to lose fiat money than cryptocurrency because there ARE ways to recover it, whether it is the actual money stolen or compensation. Who cares as long as they have at least some of their money back?
Good day.
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:41:30
That doesn’t lower the cost of living, it just makes it more affordable using a cryptocurrency. You still have to pay the same price. If I am rich and you are poor, but we have the exact same expenses, the cost of living for us both is the same, but it is more affordable for me than you.
@_date: 2018-07-05 11:54:06
See, now this is true. The problem is people and this determination for decentralisation - particularly with bitcoin. I’ve seen so many arguments on this subreddit about “the true spirit of cryptocurrency” and how “no form of central control should ever be established because it’s not what Satoshi wanted”.
@_date: 2018-07-14 10:53:55
I think the fact that you attach bitcoin’s lifespan to the usefulness of Blockchain tech is something to make everyone marvel. Bitcoin relies on Blockchain, not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:24:24
As long as there are non-technical people in this world, fiat money is here to stay. I think the biggest contribution from all of this wasn’t the currency but the recognition of the value and usability of Blockchain.

But if the coins can’t be recovered, does Lightning have insurance that means you’ll be reimbursed? Banks do.

Theft is the illegal acquisition of someone else’s property without permission. Now, if theft occurs due to negligence, such as giving out your private key or giving out your banking login details, then that’s entirely the fault of the individual, and whatever happens is their fault. However, if a keylogger or RAT was used, for instance, and private keys/login details were obtained, you never *gave* them to the thieves, and you are not responsible for the theft.
Though your own private keys may be very secure, the world does not operate based on those who know what they are doing because it cannot, but must accommodate itself for those who know the minimum required amount, and therein lies the flaw.
@_date: 2018-07-06 13:46:50
Governments make crypto illegal.
Banks and credit companies are forced to ban any crypto purchases.
Operators of mining farms are arrested. Easily tracked down based on energy consumption, like shooting a flare into the night sky.
Because this involves currency, it is a financial crime. That means it’s going to be federal. How many people are willing to do hard time in hope of the financial freedom of the rest of the world when they themselves aren’t able to profit from it?
Oh, and ISPs are forced to prohibit any connections which are simply *suspected* of involving crypto activity. 
Exchanges lose their licenses. Forced out of operation. 
This is only the start of what could be done.
Let’s make one thing absolutely clear - governments can stop cryptocurrency whenever they wish, which is why institutional investors are wary of putting money in. They gamble everyday - do you *really* think their primary worry is the collapse of the currency itself? They know the moment they throw their money into the ring, that currency is going to last, so what do they have to fear in that regard? The internet itself is not decentralised, and as long as it is required to verify transactions, mine blocks etc, crypto is not invulnerable, nor invincible. To think otherwise is absolutely stupid.

I knew this article would be ridiculous the moment I saw the title. “Cryptocurrency Philosopher”, smh.
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:09:25
Buying into houses, technologies, tangible assets etc is *not* the same as buying into something that would take away a government’s primary means of control and enforcement of power.
And the financial collapse of last decade was due to widespread excessive greed, not ignorance. The people who were involved didn’t try to prevent it - they plundered as much as they could and ran when it buckled. That was something entirely in their control, and, because of their importance to society, they knew they would be bailed out. Financial collapses happen at least once a generation, ~25 years. They played stupid to avoid jail, but they’re not stupid.
So, yea, “those guys”. Also, you just proved my point. Like I said, they gamble all the time, as you have just shown, so why wouldn’t they be willing to gamble on cryptocurrency by buying into it unless they had a genuine fear? The technology works, and it is sound.

Boy, you crypto kids will attempt to justify the worth of your coins by any means.
But hey, guess what? If you get robbed of 1mil fiat and only 500k is recovered, you still have 500k. If you get robbed of 1mil in bitcoin, you have 0.

Oh I know what I said won’t happen, lol, but I was just making the point that it is entirely possible for crypto to be brought down.
As for it being a global currency, the funny thing is that such a thing is the worst event anyone in crypto could hope for because it would force governments to regulate it as much as they do fiat money. Crypto works because it exists in the shadows of the real world - if it becomes mainstream, it will become controlled.

Silly me, thieves steal your money and spend it immediately. They don’t stash it anywhere. No criminals have ever been caught in possession of illegally-acquired currency. My bad. I watch too many fictional shows and movies. 
Also, my argument is not wearing thin. A bank and an exchange are not the same thing. I can give my money to someone to hold - does that make them a bank? No. The bitcoin ledger is the only banking system in the bitcoin world, and there’s no two ways about it. Once a transaction is completed, legally or illegally, that’s it, coins gone. It’s how bitcoin was designed. With fiat money, money going from my bank account to another can be reversed. It can even be transferred across multiple accounts and still be recovered.
Exchanges providing compensation is likely a requirement of their license to operate, given that they’re handling the digital assets of someone else, and that’s a completely separate issue.
