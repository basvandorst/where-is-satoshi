Paolo from bitwage here. Yes, we can provide you a standard routing number you can provide to your employer so we can help you collect your salary/wages, our international freelancers find this very economical, since it saves their employers the cost of sending an expensive international wire; digital nomads find this a good way to facilitate payments.  
Re: accounting, We can give you a historical record of all your payments via .csv, but for loss/gain calcs, you would have to calculate this on your own or perhaps you can use a service such as r/ ; just to be clear...this is not an endorsement of r/ Thanks!

Because there are those who may want to purchase bitcoin but do not have a bank account or access to one. In fact there are roughly 2.5 Billion people who are 'unbanked' according to the latest World Bank report on financial inclusion released in 2014:
REPORT HIGHLIGHTS: "The 2014 Global Financial Development Report: Financial Inclusion, is the most comprehensive report yet on the topic. It comes as policy makers are pushing to reach the world’s unbanked — 2.5 billion people who make up about half of the world’s adult population. More than 50 countries recently set targets to improve financial inclusion. Last month, Jim Yong Kim — President, World Bank Group — announced a new initiative to provide universal financial access to all working-age adults by 2020 — with the help of technological innovations such as e-money accounts and e-mobile wallets."
With the advent of Bitwage, even those who do NOT have a bank account--the 'unbanked'--and also the 'under-banked' have a way to easily acquire bitcoins at fair and very reasonable rates.

Amagi Metals will operate purely in bitcoin. It has a NO FIAT policy. &lt; And Bitwage is currently solving this "tax problem" by partnering with a tax firm--so in the future it will be not be a hassle for Bitwage Users to make tax calculations. Also-Bitwage allows one to determine what percentage of payroll they would like to take in bitcoin and fiat. And with "zero-click payrolls" there is no added work heaped upon payroll admins.

Paolo from Bitwage here. The above statement by haqhenas is false. Bitwage DOES NOT ask for your bank account information or any of the other documents you listed. But Bitwage does ask for your name, address, email, phone number, and certain forms of primary ID to apply the necessary AML, KYC, Identity Check, and compliance protocols to make sure of a potential customer's identity as Bitwage abide's by US laws and regulations. i.e. With regards to payroll info we ask what dates you might be expecting to get paid and how much so we can facilitate the buying of bitcoins on your behalf and also implement AML protocols.

Paolo from Bitwage here. Thank you for your thoughtful response haqshenas and the opportunity to answer your comment. 
The Bitwage Terms of Service (TOS) is boiler plate TOS and therefore not at all unusual. Your initial comment was misleading because it insinuated that all those documents were needed during the on-boarding process--which of course--it is NOT. 
The Bitwage on-boarding process is not time-consuming, and much less intrusive b/c one does not need to enter bank account information and/or credit card information. We only ask for documents such as credit reports in the event we think something is amiss and we need to to implement enhanced due-diligence for suspicious activities or transactions, or requests. Again...nothing out of the ordinary in terms of security and compliance protocols here that the big players in the bitcoin space and/or a responsible financial institution is doing.
I applaud your enthusiasm for carefully reading our Terms of Service haqshenas; we encourage that all of our customers and clients do as you have and carefully read our TOS :) Thank you for your interest and providing the stage upon which to talk about Bitwage and our products and services--much appreciated!

Thanks for the question DarkLinkXXXX. We wait until the wire or ACH for payroll comes in, so we always have enough to cover it. However, we have a contingency fund to draw upon in the unlikely event that we need to cover a shortfall. And no...not really a "pain in the ass" as you say...but surely just a little bit more time consuming. (we are bitcoin lifers...and this is a labor of love after all:)   )

Bitwage specializes in helping freelancers around the world get paid efficiently and in timely fashion using the blockchain, usually in 2 days and in some cases a mere 15 hours from our receipt of your payroll. Also, we can help you w/issuing your client an itemized record of your payroll transactions--not a problem. For your use case we recommend Bitcoin Payroll (Bitwage Payroll for the Individual).

Paolo from [BITWAGE]( here; I can help you get paid in bitcoin. 
HOW IT WORKS
1.  We give you a bank account number.
2.  You tell your employer to send any percentage of your payroll deposit to that number.
3.  We put bitcoin, local currency, and Gold or Silver in your address the next day after deposit.
Check out our mention in WSJ &lt;

@_date: 2015-07-06 13:08:51
Paolo from BITWAGE here. Thanks for your question SteveRD1 :)
In a nutshell...HOW IT WORKS:
1.  We give you a bank account number.
2.  You tell your employer to send your payroll deposit to that number.
3.  We put bitcoin in your address the next day after deposit.
Please note that you will only have access to our banking info if you signup successfully and are approved by the Bitwage Team. Also, if you have a payroll provider (i.e. Trinet, ADP etc.) your employer does not have to be involved.
When ACH deposits hit our account, we send the funds on the same-day to our partner exchange. We buy bitcoin with the customer's funds only after the ACH deposit is processed. If the ACH deposit hits our account on a business day, processing happens at 8am the next business day. If the ACH deposit hits our account on a holiday or weekend, then it processes at the end of the next business day. These ACH processing rules are from our bank partner. Once the ACH deposit is processed, we buy bitcoins usually within 1-2 hours, but no later than the same day, and we immediately send the bitcoins to fulfill customer orders.
