Perhaps. A coworker came to work going on and on about bitcoin. I have been following it so he and I started chatting. During his break an older coworker who had been listening went off about Bitcoin, telling me he would never own any because it was immoral. It was dark money. It was evil. Owning it was evil and people who owned it deserved to be punished. Made me really think. Yea, there are people like that out there so shut your fucking mouth.

Paper wallets are good because they're all code. You can create a crytographic hash of your bitaddress.org.html and compare it to what you find elsewhere. You can diff the code with code you download elsewhere. You can verify that YOUR copy is like everyone else's. With a HW wallet you don't provably know what's inside the box. You don't know if a rogue employee has used company secrets to tamper with your copy, signing a counterfeit. You can't prove that your HW wallet is a precise duplicate of your neighbor's, but you can do this with code. With hardware, ultimately you are trusting the company and their security. Even if they are successful in provably defeating man-in-the-middle attacks through DHL/Amazon, you still must trust the signers.
Now, with a software wallet you must trust your computer. That is a pretty big topic and if you're not comfortable with that then you might as well trust a HW wallet manufacturer.
But with HW wallets. Suppose you lose your HW wallet in Pham Ngu Lao. Vacation ruined! But you see someone selling a hardware wallet on the corner. You're in luck. Just buy one, go back to your laptop, decrypt your seed, and you're back in business. Vacation saved! But really? What are the chances your wallet was stolen in order to get you to buy a new counterfeit one that will steal your coins? You need to be extremely careful with a new hardware wallet too. You must follow every precaution offered by the manufacturer so that you trust as few people as possible. Don't use the manual that came with the wallet. Download a cooy and use that. See where I'm going with this? You need to cross-verify everything.
And so it's always a good idea to split up your funds. An HD wallet seed might control 10 coins. How are you going to feel typing that seed into a new device? HW wallets are absolutely essential for spending. They really are about the most secure way to spend Bitcoin that I can think of. But they are hardware and they will fail and you will need to eventually find a new device to trust. Wouldn't it be nice if your coins were split so that you didn't have to trust 100% of your coins to a new black box? I think so. And this is why I like paper. You can create paper in any number of ways... Electrum seedwords, bitaddress.org, bitcoin-core. You can encrypt your paper wallets (whatever ASCII text, png, PDF) using gpg and upload them, email them to yourself.

You can diff and hash code. You can't diff and hash a website or a printed circuit. How can you trust your hardware? Even with cryto-verified hardware and software, aren't you ultimately trusting the ability of the signers to keep their key secure?

I believe him. I lost about 50 BTC to either mybitcoin.com or mybitcoins.com. I can't recall which and I don't recall the exact amount either. Later they paid me back between 20 and 30 BTC as they liquidated. I was new to BTC at the time and it really burned to lose that money. But luckily I had my money split between MtGox and them and my MtGox funds were safe. I took it as a lesson, bought back the BTC I had lost, and removed my funds from MtGox. If it wouldn't have been for mybitcoin.com lesson then I would have lost it all when MtGox went down.
Coinbase is a good company with good security. They have much better security than you or I could implement. Let's all understand this. But let's also understand that mybitcoin.com and MtGox also had great security. They had much better security than you or I could implement. This was the public knowledge at the time. Now of course we MMQ their security and say it sucked shit, and one day coinbase will be in the same predicament.

Not if they actually owned coins to back what they sold. They took the guaranteed cashflow at $18k and now they'll have to sell BTC for $20k to pay for that $18k.

That mattered more when people bought whole coins. That 0.0385 coins is a pretty good day's wage I have to wonder. When someone deposits $10k for a healthy gamble then they're looking at 0.624 coins vs 0.6 vs 0.7 coins. For a $10k deposit, 700 mBtc happens at $14,285.71. So while the USD to invest can happen at whole numbers, as BTC becomes the standard of wealth the whole numbers will matter more in BTC, mBTC, and bits. Ask any almost-full-bitcoin holder how they feel about owning 0.985 BTC to confirm.

Yea. This spring I bought $200 worth to purchase a Trezor. Then that worthless coinbase wallet took the miner fee out of the total I entered so I underpaid by a few dollars and the Trezor company refunded my coins. I just transferred the BTC to my wallet and kept it. Well, that $200 is now worth $1380. Thanks, coinbase. Your terrible wallet UI gave me a seven fold return on my $200 in under a year.

YES! My initial investment was $300. Then I lost $150 of it to a shitty online wallet. Then I invested another $500 to get my coins back and add some more. Never bought again because my small investment quickly exploded and I was like fuuuuck I have too much already. But now it's worth even more and there's no end in sight. Believe it or not I just sent $1000 to coinbase. This is the first time I've invested in years. No, I don't have too much already. Despite being very lucky I still kick myself for not DCAing for the past several years like I always thought "perhaps I should". After many years of dormancy I'm planning to more than double my total investment and yet only add a fraction of a percent to my holdings. I've come to realize that Bitcoin will grow well for at least another 20 years. My initial coin is luck. I won't spend it. Those coins are my rally hat. This $1k I'm investing now I plan to use to actually spend, so be ready for a dip in ten years. Do it! Your $300 will be worth $30,000 in ten years.

This will make BTC more scarce. It could actually increase the price. I just read an article claiming that the dollar is now the most popular currency due in part to the crazy amount of regulation in the dollar market inflicting scarcity upon it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:25:54
You won't pay taxes though. It works like this...
A house costs $100k on paper but the real price is $100k + 0.1BTC. The seller won't accept $200k because then they'd pay capital gains tax on the true value. So instead they'd accept only their cost basis in fiat and demand the rest in Bitcoin, under the table. Of course these sales couldn't happen through the established channels so those sales channels will be among the first casualties as Bitcoin replaces fiat.
