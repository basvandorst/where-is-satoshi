How long does it take for them to set it up.  What's the lag time for setting up the LLC and all of this cuz in a month bitcoin and alts could be up 100-300% to their ATH or even apeak LOL
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:59:06
Do they do the LLC or do you do the LLC yourself?  In California LLCs are $800 per year.  Do they have a yearly fee too or any other fees to keep the Self directed IRA going?
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:55:08
GBTC has a 20-30% 'premeum' for their holding premium they also charge 2% fees per year.
I signed up for BitcoinIRA.com over 4 weeks ago and I'm still waiting on them... they take FOREVER and put a lot of effort into signing you up. Then once you sign up you don't hear from them.  They also have a lot of fees for trading through Genesis and BitGo wallet fees--like 2% plus another 5% if you take out of the funds
 to 'buy back'.  Also have minimums of $10-20k per trade so crazy high...
Seems like all these fees really eat into it....
2, 3, 4, 5 I've heard also have excessive fees but I don't  have first hand experience with them. Make sure your Self-directed IRA is strong

Update... now is a real DIP and is the time to buy!! I'm buying like crazy from $10k-12k

Does anyone who is a veteran or knows macro economics or tech chart analysis have predictions? Any references or suggestions
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:19:27
Yes thanks.  It's always a ball park and always moving.  I think I'm gonna make mine more like yours thanks
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:23:51
So was this a dip past couple days or was this a bear market. Anyone have links to resources
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:54:00
This is why you have to hedge against  
I totally agree BTC is the top but you gotta spread your risks..hedge your best... i'm trying to get responses on my questions here about portfolios, or pie charts spreading risk for BTC and Altcoins and ethereum etc  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:13:32
Not happy with bitcoinira.com
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:10:43
What are you guys allocating portfolio shares?  BTC to BCC/BCH?
I was thinking 50% BTC and 40% BCC and BitcoinGold Litecoin 20% and other forks?  I feel the need to hedge more
Feel like a lot sold BTC for bitcoin cash...but how much is 'safe
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:40:24
Anyone use  their fees are really high.  Do you think it's worth it?  Are there any other options?  Or is it better to just invest in a low fee Bitcoin buying like CoinBase.com and just pay taxes on your capital gains way later??? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:04:31
Just letting you all know I did double down and put in at $11500k. I think I made good move. Any thoughts?  I guess now I could lose it all lol
I’m just buying and holding. 
I’m also thinking about putting in more I wish I did. Do you think it could go down again any time soon or are we at bottom
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:11:08
Why hold USD?  it's inflationary.  I'd rather hold 100% BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:01:15
That’s because some of us are newer. I get it I’m a Newb.  I believe in the decentralization, the movement and the profit. 
Should I be buying more? I bought at $19,000-19,800 unfortunately I got to excited about the tech and opportunity. 
Is this the end of parabolic market or is the beginning of bear market or is it just a blip and btc will go up parabolically again?
Should I be doubling down?  I was thinking of just putting in double
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:25:08
Are you guys splitting to 80 : 20  BTC: BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:09:51
I'm holding 5+ years but I'm reallocating on 3 month terms every quarter
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:22:52
Thanks man. That sounds pretty stable. They prob also didn’t have a crazy backer going on CNBC the day before telling people to be ready to liquidate lol 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:12:28
2018-- Cryptos will continue flatlining....vertically
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:13:49
So true. Well some exchanges don't show the price you bought it in at or transfered it.
So you have to go to that day and use Coinmarketcap or another site to look it up.
From there you can compute it.  
If you did dollar cost averaging over a long period of time this will be really difficult.
Anyone have more detailed advice?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:08:03
lol stupidddd
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:10:32
I actually hold Verge in my altcoin, but for this one I just wanted to keep a balanced portfolio of the top five caps.
I have one long term portfolio and also a separate one I use for alts
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:54:16
Anyone have thoughts on Bitgo?
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:07:13
How soon do you think there will actually be a potential dip... A dip has now changed to be at the price of about $10-15k since it's gone up so much since the OP.
Right now it's $18800 per BTC
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:22:46


Based on what? 
What are your projections on these coming forks?:
Bitcoin Unlimited 
Bitcoin Platinum Dec. 12 ?
Bitcoin Cash Plus Jan 2 2018
Bitcoin Silver       ?
Bitcoin Uranium      ?
Bitcoin God Dec. 25 2017
Any of them to be concerned with as far as affect on total market or something similar to BCH/BCC?  Thoughts on future FORKS?

QUESTION... did this AOL investor/owner actually sell AOL ahead of it's demise?  How long is he holding BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:13:15
Hey thanks for the info.  man I signed up with them 2 weeks ago and I'm still waiting as I see all the Crypto rise 20-30%.  So my funds are just sitting around and it's taking forever.
That's really annoying they didn't mention anything about a % of holding fee.  
I'm thinking I will send them a letter to CANCEL.  Because they have taken so long
It seems like  is spending more on buzzline marketing (sending emails daily)  but not enough on their own product, speeding up the transfers, or spending on security vs marketing....
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:01:33
I agree with this... Today's too high to buy is tomorrows 'dip'
A lot of answers are just generic 10-15% = dip.
Well in bitcoin really it could go up 20% before that ' dip'  which means like you said... it might be better to jsut buy now....
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:08:06
Anyone have information on how many people or the population of people that are in bitcoin or not?  I assume a lot of people are 'playing' with bitcoin like under $10k USD worth.  But how soon will $1mm + USD accounts pour into bitcoin?  I'd like to understand actual numbers and data behind this? How much of the population in the US actually invest in it substantially?  What percentage of the world's population invest in it?  Are there any projections on how many will in 2018 or in the future?  A lot are assuming that 2018 will be the "herd" but how do you know those people will just think it's a bubble and never want to put in any substantial amount over just play money (under $10k USD)
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:24:11
I doubled down and put my original investment again when it was at $11500ish today  hope it doesn't tank more. if it does i'm really screwed
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:47:54
I don't get it either I signed up for bitcoinira.com and I've been waiting on trading.  BitcoinIRA hasn't explained anything to me and I'm in the dark just browsing through BitGo.com trying to figure out how I make trades.  It doesn't seem to be quick by the user or like a normal exchange. I have to call in or something...just annoying
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:16:47
For the most part I agree, but I think there could be a HUGE correction sooner than later.  
I think get into bitcoin on the next correction possibly it will go down when CBOE and CME shorts start happening in the Futures market.
Once they short it to $12000-13,000 then but as much Bitcoin as possible.  It's likely to go up to $30,000-100k by the end of the year.  But it will definitely correct FIRST.  It has gone up too much in November- December.  I think it's possible to have a HUGE correction before the end of the year (like 20-30% down)
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:03:25
To me a dip is 5-10% drop.  But then it goes up 5-10% or even 15% over a week.  So the advice to 'buy on a dip' is not working.
Really buy on a Correction of 20+% might be the right way.  But then the follow up question is will there even be a correction or are we at the beginning of a run up/ bubble?!!  Oh man...
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:01:14
thanks is Blox fully synced with the big exchanges?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:30:34
Also I've looked into Self directed IRAs and although they seem better costwise (avoiding the 15% fee) I was also told that they can be easily messed up, therefore losing a ton of savings.  This is such a grey area I wouldn't want to fudge my retirement accounts or mess it up
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:21:57
review? is it automated?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:09:25

@_date: 2017-12-23 00:18:11
I’m doing that but it will still be a big hit it’s a lot of my savings. I just don’t believe in stocks and am taking out

Can I get some advice  Feeling FUD. What is the projected market share of BTC/BCC/BCG (self.Bitcoincash)
Submitted just now by crayola110
What is the projectd market share of BTC to BCC/BCH?
Is it 70/30 50/50 or are you all projecting that Bitcoin cash is going to dominate and take over BTC?
Serious question as last night my portfolio was wrecked with the GDAX/ coinbase unveiling combined with Roger vers announcements then I felt FUD dumped, and had to buy into BTC at high amount again. I feel that BTC will keep making come back and BCC/BCH will be a small market share
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:12:17
Hey I'm tempted to do that Redditvoodoo... I'm just going to hold BCH (beecoin) for short term 3 months because I think a lot of coinbase newbs will be buying it... again that's just for the short term-- 3 month hold.
Every 3 months I will re allocate and rebalance my portfolio
Let me just lower bcash to 5%
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:08:45
Any updates Oldfcuk?
I'm actually thinking of rolling my Roth IRA into bitcoinIRA which charges a whopping 13% of your entire account!!  This is to avoid any confusion with banks or possibly losing my Roth IRA due to me doing something wrong.
I'm in California where taxes are a whoping 13% + the 15-20% federal long term cap gains tax.  
So I'm trying to sav about 33% in eventual long term cap gains taxes on my profit..
Anyone do this?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:24:25
Anyone think it will lower I bought in at $13k thinking it was dip but wondering if it will go more down
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:00:50
Thanks to those who responded.  Are those automatically updated and synced with exchanges?
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:15:58
I think stocks are highly over rated right now.  Trading at highest multiples of earnings in decades.  
Blockchain/ cryptos also trading at merely speculation levels. But at least Bitcoin has more wider adoption and as time goes by smart money is getting into it.  Currently banks are trying to find ways to flood and scale crypto investing.
I would rather speculate on cryptos with a much higher 'reward' even if they can devalue at a greater chance then traditional stocks.
Either way I have about 40&amp; of my total worth in real estate \(apartments\), 10&amp; cash, 20&amp; cryptos, and 30&amp; traditional stocks
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:12:54
overall i'm down so I'm just going to hodl until it returns.   Luckily April was a great month and I'm getting closer to my original buy in each day!
