Most people don’t know who there local MP is, as we stand here today there is nothing great about Britain and fear and ignorance pushed us out of the EU. There are people who respected and appreciate the values the EU represents. I am not sure which part of the UK you come from but Europe offered hope to forward thinking youngster from underprivileged backgrounds. It offered opportunity to be part of the world not this ignorant tiny little grey island. I cried the day we voted out because I honestly thought the country I was proud was better than this, better than fear.

The idea is to experiment I guess, it intrigues me the idea of currency swaying to purely peer 2 peer. All be it probably not the best decision from a business stance the idea of only using Crypto seemed interesting. 
Yeah that is something that I considered but I would absorb the cost within my invoice, visibly doing so, so I wasn’t to worried about that. 
Yeah I had thought about litecoin but wasn’t too sure how wide spread it is yet.

What a guy! If we are not careful this guys will become the face of Crypto ^^^
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:47:51
Yeah target audience is clearly going to be a point of interest. 
I guess my reasoning is that people would be more willing to invest in services with Bitcoin as often their initial investment on Bitcoin was much lower than their purse now. 
Arguably someone could have £500 of my services when their initial investment back in 2006 was £2. I know it’s not that black and white but from that perspective Bitcoin seems to make a bit more sense for my type of services. 
Yeah, I’m currently at the day job but i will put something together and send it across. Maybe I can offer some discount as you could potentially be my pilot job ha. 
Thanks for the info!

Bitcoin is still investing, that rule is there for good safe reasons, you still live and trade with humans. Would you tell him to go buy crystal meth if it was in a decentralised market? We are not a decentralised digital super race just yet ...

I really don’t think you understand the sentiment here. He can obviously do what he wants but the exchanges literally will not “allow” a minor to invest. So before you mis-quote please read what was said.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:34:17
Nah, EU represents what the world should be I am not sure where you are getting this from. Is this Nigel Farage?

They would have bought houses for 1 bitcoin and tell us we are lazy for not having a house that now costs 20 bitcoins ....
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:21:05
Do you live in the UK? We have basically taken the only good fucking thing we had going for us and took a shit on it. Every politician said it was a mistake, even the voters who went leave are saying it is by majority. It was a cock up and we are closer to slaves than we ever where. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:54:51
Yeah I agree, the more we look like a gorilla movement the less likely it will be taken into day to day. We are already have a hard battle on our hands here guy. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:01:41
Based on what you are saying if it’s a repeat surely where all about to get another payday! I wouldn’t stress it so much. The market is just trying stabilise itself after the batshit crazy 2017 it had. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:54:48
To true my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:44:39
What if you get your burgers fast let and cheaper? What if the rich guys get to jump the line and affect the prices of everyone else’s burgers? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:22:44
You don’t that’s why your not allowed.

Mrs May is getting that Moon money even if she has to take away your NHS!!

Sometimes people just don’t want Burger King. The first wheel was made out of stone, being the first doesn’t make it the best.

Lower than it is now or dead. Bitcoin was created and has grown as a direct response to failed government regulation. With out strict money laws, Bitcoin by definition wouldn’t need to exist thus not be popular. Bitcoin’s primary function isn’t profit... 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:40:23
This vile mound of flesh really brings out my creativity ha!

You could barter with all of our Great British Exports, do you take Chav's by chance? or maybe crippling depression? 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:19:49
Ah fair enough then, that’s good to know. I have worked for myself for some years in the UK and come into property on occasion. My experience is in the UK that if I earn something of value the government wants a slice, no exceptions, no loopholes. It’s just a case of laws catching up with the tech. 
Profit = tax in my experience 
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:02:25
I am making a point, it’s hard to count out anyone. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:56:40
I bought down at the bottom and I am already in the black today. Everything seems to be bouncing back for the minute. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:50:10
I am normally diplomatic and chilled on reddit but this fucking scarecrow can ram it up her shit pipe. Theresa May is a bellend and has no right running a country. If she ruins Bitcoin I’m leaving.

I literally deposited gbp the other week. They do accept British pounds.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:25:08
Not yet but I am definitely going to the "HODL to the grave" scrip when it eventually comes. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:49:58
Oh yeah I did use my card so I’m guessing that’s why.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:42:41
I honestly think this will be deferred post Brexit and we will end up with some sketchy patchwork law. The UK at the minute is all about taxing whatever it can and I imagine post Brexit will be no different. I’d say expect trading restrictions to be minimal but for the HMRC to have his hand in all your juicy Moon money. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:29:18
Lucky us ha. But I am putting a little aside when it comes to fiat as I am expecting a capital gains bill in the near future. Nice to see they are starting to work on it though, thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:03:42
Revolut? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:39:14
More likely the store bought their burgers from the same wholesale company but just haven’t been around long so people don’t trust it. 
Maybe people are being lured in and manipulated  by the shiny signs and the fact Burger King is the norm...
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:55:47
The above is pretty accurate but even if we had more trading pairs or direct pairs to fiat you would still get some resemblance to this. As a lot of what effects crypto is public opinion and at the minute the “masses” tie all the coins with the same label, ‘Bitcoin’. So when you get bad press people lose confidence in crypto as a whole. Once coins like ETH are established fully in their own right (may be years and years away) people will distinguish that separation and this will ease up... hopefully. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:18:56
I feel like we are slowly dying Bitcoin for ourselves, we should stop I’m getting depressed ha! 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:08:36
Thank you! This exactly what I was thinking, I am glad you think its a good idea. I post in a few months with how it is going. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:43:46
Yeah but this sub isn’t about BCH your just flaming for no reason. The article post was interesting, why even mention it? So petty. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:53:20
Why is everyone so aggressive here? Iv been to r/btc and no one told me too eff off. You guys are so obsessed with Bitcoin Cash, are you scared of it? My main holding is BTC so I am clearly a neutral party but there are surely two sides to the argument and no one here seems to want to know. It’s called debate and you don’t seem capable.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:40:55
[laughing I want to.]( 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:15:13
We all understand the pro’s and cons but this is literally your perspective. Why are you all being so narrow minded and belligerent? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:09:20
You clearly have issues that reach further than crypto. Opinion is opinion, get a life and start insulting people on the internet? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:03:20
Ooo he’s been on Reddit for 7 weeks he’s clearly a knowledgeable source. This thread honestly does more damage to bitcoin than good most days. Hey man do a bit of research, it has its benefits and holds its value pretty well. Don’t get caught up in all the bullshit.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:14:21
Iv been there man, it’s really not. People where actually pretty nice and up for fair debate.
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:41:15
You just grammar checked a slur? This world has truly gone down the sink. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:40:20
“Plot twist” rename this sub to ‘r/reasons we hate BCash” that would seem more relevant, right? Maybe concentrate on supporting Bitcoin more and less on ‘Bcash’ hate guys, you will find you will make a lot more progress.
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:36:45
Why even mention “BCash” ? This sub can be so petty, get over it.

So your a millionaire, you don’t only make 40k a year ... sort your books out and pay the tax. Bitcoin isn’t a tax evasion scheme. You made investment gains, pay the tax. Now if you lost all of those millions then you don’t owe any tax. I would do some research here man.
