if it's really that easy to do - then there's nothing to prevent either side from doing it though...

self interest is the cornerstone of being a libertarian.

@_date: 2017-03-24 16:05:06
what's the hold up - let's do this
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:07:34


aren't miners part of the community?
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:33:51
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:53:45
Ver and Jihan are like the dao hacker - they've gamed the system. Bad actors need to be targeted and weeded out to preserve our decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:45:54


Well judging by the mining situation you came at the wrong time...
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:33:13
But I thought Bitcoin doesn't have a CEO
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:08:36
Exactly. That's why I don't get conservatives and their climate change denial.
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:56:52
A lot.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:58:39
Satoshi never predicted that unfortunately. Good thing Bitcoin is in the very capable hands of core. I trust their leadership and governance.
@_date: 2017-03-24 17:52:07
If Bitcoin was centralized we would have innovated years ago with the snap of a finger. This is proof that we are decentralized. This is a beautiful thing to watch - let the chaos organize itself!!
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:22:45
Bitcoin's resistance to change is a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:22:13
Jihan and Roger are only playing the game using the rules set by bitcoin itself. There is nothing in the white paper that puts in law that miners can't centralize.
the only way to stop it is you. the only way is to hard fork bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:27:02
Amir Taaki is the hero bitcoin needs. Gavin, Hearn, Grazik just didn't get it. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:58:42
Bitcoin wasn't meant for you then.

Those generals would be court martialed for dessertion.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:00:33
The end game is the collapse of governments and the rise of decentralized governance as seen in Bitcoin. A world where there are no banksters but rather level 2 solutions. Where there is no one in control but the market and code/math.
@_date: 2017-03-24 18:01:35
Ding ding
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:29:44
If Bitcoin can be held back by 5 people then that's not much of a decentralized system
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:27:36
So the new version would be an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:06:34
Nobody can censor Bitcoin

It's a place where whales wash up

A true libertarian.
@_date: 2017-03-23 18:14:42
Don't bring the Donald into this. I know a couple of people on here who would be insulted by your insinuation. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:59:45
And satoshi also left the keys to Gavin Andersen....so let's not start appeals to authority. The code stands by itself.

Same. This was definitely orchestrated by vitalik and ver. Likely in conjunction with the CIA (Gavin) + China ruling party in a well coordinated joint strike. If it isn't obvious by now: NWO. Look it up. For anyone calling this tin foil material I challenge you to give proof otherwise.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:20:16
too ironic
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:14:15
how is not looking after your self-interests not Libertarian?
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:25:00
don't let the door hit you on the way out!
@_date: 2017-03-31 18:18:48
So vitalik isn't a dictator then?
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:36:46
ironically it's the freemarket that enabled ver to amass the amount of coins he has and for jihan to dominate mining
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:05:51
bitcoin cannot be censored.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:00:59
It's an altcoin. We don't need to discuss that here.
@_date: 2017-03-24 00:30:31
i'm not sure why people don't get this.
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:13:03
This. Let's stay close to satoshi's vision guys.
@_date: 2017-03-30 22:37:43
Incorrect. Decentralize or bust. There's no such thing as kind of immutable.
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:01:46
I agree let's do this!!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:20:44
Agreed. But don't vilify greed. Self interest is corner stone of the markets.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:03:43
this guy gets it
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:41:03
Our only God is decentralization.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:17:12
Agreed. Bitcoin is only for the strong.
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:02:16
The cornerstone of The Bitcoin system is not charity.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:09:40
I thought it's always been the sentiment here that bitcoin *is* political by nature.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:16:41
yes. not sure why people haven't been dumping more. you should.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:19:26
hail to the kings! thumbs up.
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:48:44
Well judging by the all time high we should have hard forks more often.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:40:51
lol ltc. stop promoting your alts in here.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:20:30
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:24:35
bitcoin is the one true coin. get that alt coin outta here mate.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:44:24
it's the price of decentralizzation
@_date: 2017-08-26 07:13:07
shout it from the hills brother
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:26:52
free market. normies don't know the price of freedom and decentralizzation

that’s smart money right there
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:11:33

@_date: 2017-11-29 09:15:23
i think we’re in agreement
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:04:16
War never changes.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:00:36
it’s an attack via markets
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:02:06
Bitcoin is antifragile. We'll get stronger with these attacks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:50:51
it kinda has. it’s dropped 90% before. $30 to $2.
tulips didn’t introduce anything new to the world. not all bubbles are the same. remember the internet bubble? this is closer to that - the kind where you’re excited about what happens after the hype dies.
p2p technologies are hard to clamp down on - like file sharing/torrenting - you can squash it but it will pop up in different forms. information does not like to be contained. you are also assuming that technology does not improve - if anything the odds are that improvements on these tools will be exponential in nature. you are also betting against an technology that, like the internet, is open and global in nature. even if it dropped 90% tomorrow - the cat is out of the bag. p2p ledgers are here to stay.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:12:21
nah just hodl
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:32:37
bitcoin has experienced 90% drops before and survived. don’t panic just hodl. we’ll be fine long term.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:59:05
true they are free to manipulate because there are no regulations
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:17:46

He's also writing a book on Ethereum. I wouldn't trust him.
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:05:43
Bitcoin is alegal. We don't need the SEC and we don't need the Indian government.
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:49:10
The stalemate is proof that we are decentralized and no one is in control.
@_date: 2017-04-27 11:32:18
The sad thing about decentralization is that it creates the perfect conditions for power to consolidate.
@_date: 2017-04-29 00:48:41
That's what they tell you but wait till the get in the door and close the door right behind them.
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:08:39

@_date: 2017-09-28 20:03:38
bitcoin will not fail. it is decentralized and so it is antifragile.

i want a ship where it’s fully controlled by the rare engineers and so they can’t be ousted ever
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:34:35

@_date: 2017-09-28 19:54:12


that’s why I don’t trust charlie lee. ulterior motives.
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:28:53
one hard fork is enough. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:13:13
You forgot Brian Armstrong, Coinbase and bitpay.
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:37:54
I want one!
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:30:27
There is no need for trust. The only people I put faith in are the core devs.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:15:24
 immutability is expensive.
layer 2 solutions. side chains. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:09:52
the hero bitcoin needs
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:56:41
who put this in the hands of the miners in the first place?
@_date: 2017-05-30 19:01:38
bitcoin is anti fragile. it doesn't matter what jihan wants - we will prevail.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:55:55
this. fuck the banks!! keep bitcoin decentralized!!!
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:52:41
don't let the door hit you on the way out
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:54:57
fuck banks if you want fuck. bitcoin is for teh people. you can keep your mutable coin, we'll keep the decentralizaation.

@_date: 2017-05-20 18:46:02
whish i could upvote this thrice!!
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:51:10


jesus that's centralized
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:25:29
 resistance to change is a feature not a bug.
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:13:07
is it really "bitcoin" that is resistant to controversial changes? Or is it the miners? 
because right now, bitcoin's starting to feel kind of centralized in their hands.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:12:25
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:58:27
is it really decentralized if 99% of the users want it but you have to appeal to an authority to get something done?
@_date: 2017-06-13 00:41:59
Ok great. So who's going to compromise? Or are all the decisions centralized with a few key players on both sides?
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:54:12
by definition yes. they hard forked 5 times already. the dao was only the third one, there were two before then another two after.
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:05:51
bitcoin is centralized around miners not developers. good thing we will uasf.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:55:06
trying? bitcoin is already centralized in china.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:29:15
i agree
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:57:04
Can we go back to the old days when altcoins weren't allowed in here? posts like this just give attention.
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:54:56
nice concern troll
@_date: 2017-06-01 12:07:33
Normies will be bitcoin's downfall.
@_date: 2017-06-05 00:43:51
Agreed the host should keep his opinions to himself.
@_date: 2017-06-09 19:06:51
Boom. Never understood those spenders.
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:58:12
is bitcoin legal? we taking cues from the government now?
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:07:15
fiat is against the principles of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:48:57
This. We don't want what happened to ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-29 04:07:55
that's the easiest way for you to make money for sure.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:59:22
Beautifully put. Freedom and immutability is expensive. These pussies don't want to pay the price. Lets stay strong in our core ideals. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:16:01
i trust the devs but why was mining centralization allowed in the first place?
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:03:16
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:01:24
well it already is - so we're just reversing it. UASF!
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:07:24
we don't compromise decentralizzation

you mean litecoin?
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:53:58
You might be on to something there.
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:42:27
who gave it to jihan in the first place
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:23:55
shut up
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:47:15
slippery slope. you don't compromise decentralizzation.
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:41:15
exactly. as long as we're decentralized and immutable we'll see deadlocks. And there will be more deadlocks in the future - that is a good sign.
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:02:15
TO THE MOON!!!
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:11:32
True - ETC made so much damage that they won't be able to catch up to us. The dao will slow their growth.

ok i am pro core but that's a good post.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:14:48
if bitcoin can be coopted then it's not anti fragile.

Damn straight. Stick it to the man.

I'm with Tone Vays.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:02:37
it's not china-coin right now? that's why we need to take back control with uasf!
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:57:54
true. it only matters with bitcoin.

the result of one company? what kind of centralized system is that 
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:09:16
which authority should i notify? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:49:07
moving slow is a feature of bitcoin decentralization. not a bug.

@_date: 2017-06-12 17:14:52
Looks like all the concern trolls came out.
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:35:29
we may never stop. the problem is when the rest of the market starts calling you a shitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:53:55
HODL you pussies!
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:03:16
they can take their hard forks. bitcoin is the immutable chain.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:48:57


wtf - source?

nothing bro that shit is ridic
