Lol, I swear that's what is going on right now. Every single day, there is some dude with a chart, bunch of lines and 80's (even earlier, candle charts were invented in middle age China if I remember correctly lmao) technical analysis terms while Cryptos are doing 25th century break dance.

Bakkt volume is growing exponentially. Institutional money is coming in. My prediction: we may see 13-14k in no time. 
HODL it my brethren!

Cex.io newsletter:
“The 18 millionth Bitcoin was mined last Friday. That’s 85% of the total Bitcoin supply, which is limited to 21 million.
Interestingly, after the 17 millionth BTC was mined in April 2018, the BTC price jumped by 30% within a month.
Will history repeat?”

I have read the comments and as it seems not a single person in this sub has any idea what is going on and has their money invested in something they don’t understand.

Of course this is a war. They are losing power and control. 
As the saying goes, if you can't beat it then join it so I would assume lots of these people who are behind the governing bodies and have a tiny bit of tech understanding are already holding crypto or pouring their money into crypto startups. 
These "huge" price fluctuations are the sign of we are in the beginning of something far greater and bigger than the whole modern financial market model. 
As someone already mentioned, crypto is a silent revolution.

And what are corresponding items and services, drugs, weapons and hitmen?
Jokes aside, what do you use it for?
And why don’t you use DAI for example if you really want to use it as a currency?
And how can you use something as a currency when it has so high volatility?

All you gotta do is bring up an article that proves them wrong and watch them losing their confidence in a sec.

Buy it directly from an established brand company so they have the liability if something goes wrong.

I would get a lawyer involved if they refuse to help out. Sorry for your experience. I can imagine how must that suck.

In that case, whales must be an organized group which manipulates the market which is unlikely. More like the price is influenced by natural factors such as public and institutional trust, new money, government actions and such. 
We are talking about a worldwide money network which is technically so advanced people don’t fully understand. 
As we go human beings start catching up with the idea and it’s in everyone’s best interest to keep the wealth private and confidential.

I’ll communicate this to Mr Xi. Thank you.
