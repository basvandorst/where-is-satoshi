It will be located at the Santa Lucia Pizza at 4 St. Mary's Road.
Here's the folk doing it:

I ordered a couple of things from them, they eventually came through but it did take awhile..
Ordered Nov 17, confirmation on Nov 29
Ordered Nov 21, confirmation on Dec 7
I haven't tried recently from them, the places in Canada I want to order from, they are having issues with.  (apple.ca, homedepot.ca)  Not their fault, just fussy here with where credit cards come from.

Go find a windows dev and convince him it's worthwhile.  There has to be a bunch of forums dedicated to windows phone dev, throw a post or 6 up, I'm sure someone will bite.  Electrum is a light wallet, doesn't need the horsepower or storage of a full bitcoind wallet... 
@_date: 2014-01-20 22:03:56
I'm just a happy customer, several orders and a tool chest ordered (to be delivered in Canada)
I've just ordered a physical card, I'll let everyone know when it arrives.

A quick google shows the Windows malware count in the millions (only several hundred active at a time)
OSX count is at 45, total.
Linux is around the same, ~50 total.
So, I think the 'less targeted' statement holds pretty solid, 45 is less than several million.
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:12:09
I agree that the snapcard folk are great, but they have the same issues with Canada that I had with all4btc, credit card trickiness.

And there's the problem.  I like Eco system support(and Unix) and Android doesn't do a complete Eco system. (unless you're into Chromebook/boxes and that's a bit lacking in power for me)

I pre-ordered a Debt card in May of 2014, I'm sure it'll be here in a couple of weeks, max!  :P

Agreed, I think it's a whole bunch of vanity mirrors, little tiny ones.

Interesting idea...
45 watt kit from HF is $192.
My ASIC system is currently consuming 3100 watts (BFL minirig N some singles)
That means I need 69 kits from HF..  That's $13000 so far.
At the moment I'm getting ~10 hours light per day so we should double the solar capacity so I can store 1/2 for at night.  We're at $26000 now.
I'll leave out the cost of batteries to store the extra power (too lazy to do that math)
Cost of power where I am (.07) works out to ~$150/month so break even on power for the solar system is ~173 months or 14 years.
I don't think this is going to work out so well for me.  Although at the end of it I will have a kickass solar system for the house.

Been looking through okpay's website and I don't think they do bitcoin anylonger. (at least related to the card)
"Please note that OKPAY Card cannot be purchased or loaded with bitcoin."

I gave bitcoinsaresexy.com a shot 3 days ago and no response as of yet.
($100 to paypal)
Edit: Seems a combination of stuck email caused confusion.  (I wasn't notified of the paypal deposit and his email ate my order update request)
The order was executed in a timely manner. (within 2 hours)  Thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-08 01:32:33
I'm not sure anyone would admit to ordering one.
One side would be "OMG what are you mining, bet you're making some cool $$$"
The other side would be "Sucker!! you've wasted sooo much! You should've left it as BTC!"
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:42:27
I've had good luck selling BTC for paypal using bitcoinsaresexy.
His business depends on good word of mouth, if he starts taking the $$ back folk on reddit/forums would tank his site.
@_date: 2013-03-03 23:31:18
If your order is before mine, then yes, please get a refund.

He's still a company so if he wants any sort of rep, he best give all the cash back.

He's giving back equivalent BTC for the original US$ amount.
(Have a friend who pre-ordered a couple of bASIC units, one refund is back, the other is pending still)

Avalons are beginning to arrive in the US.
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:27:23
I've been wondering about that.
Could an ASIC be used for general crypto hashing?
Some inventive person buys up used ASICs and uses them to brute force passwords?
Would the NSA like a room full of ASICs?
(or China?)
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:12:58
The two extremes you should look at are:
Avalon - extremely basic aesthetic design, you get a pair of white gloves to keep from cutting yourself.
Butterfly - Magic box with a nexus 7 built-in, you just plug in your pool ID and BTC starts flowing.
Now, while pretty, Butterfly's hardware hasn't shipped yet so all that beauty/power is theoretical.
If you want to get into the ASIC game, you'd best move fast.  Avalon is slowly but surely shipping and if Butterfly ships you'll have to have a pretty fast/low power unit in order to compete.
Last is pricepoint.  As new folk come out with ASIC hardware, the established folk will be able to adjust their prices, the new guy might not have the wiggle room.

We're going to use localbitcoins to send PHP to family and they will donate to the local Red Cross via banks.
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:00:58
Nothing really exists yet except ASICMiner.
Avalon keeps saying it's shipping but we haven't heard anything except 3-4 boxes arriving.
Bfl as mentioned is RSN (soon as seen from an Oak tree's point of view)
So, if you think a share of whatever ASICMiner is dealing looks good to you, that's about the only option right now.

I'm still hunting for a refillable prepaid MC or Visa that I can use as a Canadian.  (some out there only deal with Europe)

How about google play cards?

Or  (eCardOne before their domain was taken down)
I did try  no issues other than being online only.
@_date: 2013-10-05 05:55:58
Only US sites or could we order from Canadian ones as well?
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:50:22
They were another supplier of ASIC based miners.
Something went wrong and a product was never produced.
(I heard health problems)
Sooo, he's slowly paying back all the BTC he took in pre-orders.
@_date: 2013-03-08 16:55:15
There's only really 2 players so far.
bfl - No shipped product, heaps of backorders.
Avalon - supposedly shipping but not too many (&lt;10?) seen in the wild.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:14:06
I'm not sure that would work out well.
"If you can't ship me my minirig, ship me 300 Jalepenos!"
Imagine trying to actually make 300 Jals work..  300 power bricks, I don't know how many USB hubs, and I think you're well over the limits of USB bus design.  And the horror of trying to figure out which 5 of the 300 units isn't working.
I don't like that they're shipping just Jals either but the other alternatives aren't much better.  "Sorry everyone, until we figure out the MR issue, noone gets anything!"  Imagine the internet shitstorm that would spawn.

Have you used them?  Comments?

Just bittip it to me and we'll be all set!

You browse sales sites as per normal (amazon, newegg, etc) and when you're on a page with product(s) you're interested in, you click their bookmarlet and it'll highlight the products on the page.  You click on the item you like, confirm you want it, and pay through their site, using bitcoin(coinbase).  Their system then purchases the item with shipping going to you.  Simple to type, I'm thinking very complex to implement.
(don't work for them, just lucky enough to be a betatester)

ASICs won't stay elite, the prices will come down as competition grows.
How many folk want a massive desktop with 4 video cards melting the cat in the living room of their apartment?
On the other hand, a cute Apple TV sized box quietly making BTC is much more palatable. 
I don't see a problem with ASICs, but they will make for quite the dump  on ebay of video cards once they come to full power.
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:47:27
At 68GH/s and three hundred shipped, we should have 20TH with avalon alone.
Also, a friend ordered early and hasn't seen any sign of a tracking number yet.
ASICMiner is doing over 5TH by themselves so that leaves 5TH since avalons ship date which works out to... ~70 avalons if that's all that's adding to the pool. (there's alot of GPU users jumping back in as well what with BTC now earning them more than the power costs)
Sooo, yeah, there are probably some Avalons out there, but not nearly enough for what they say have been shipped.
@_date: 2013-03-06 20:32:05
Like the value of most things, supply and demand.
Lots of supply (sand) not much value.
Lots of demand (diamonds) lots of value.
So, lots of folk want BTC right now and are willing to pay $50 per.
Why?  Part of that could be greater media attention (KimDotCom)
Part of that could be bASIC needing ALOT of BTC to pay back everyone who bought into his design.  (I heard he needs to pay back something like $1M)
Now, maybe it's a bit of both..  bASIC starts buying up most of the available BTC which drives the price up (some) and the media catches onto the price spike and folk start jumping on the bandwagon driving up prices more..  (maybe?)
I'm pretty much speaking off the hip, but that's how I'm seeing it these days.

Welp, no go with dagensia.
They don't allow registrations from anyone in North America.

Whoever that was is a bit ahead of himself.
The bumped wafers already were at the packaging facility and are still being packaged.  (put on something that'll mount on a board and take a heatsink) 
They still need to be assembled onto the boards before heading to KC for instalation in cases and shipping.
Packaging means the raw silicon is being put on the substrate and into it's FCBGA package. From there the chips go to the assembly house and they are mounted on the boards. Then the boards are shipped to KC for final assembly and programming.
So BFL_Josh, based upon where they are at now and what needs to be done, next week sometime for the first pre-orders to be sent out potentially?
BFL_Josh: Yes, that's what it's looking like right now.
That's the news as I read it from bfl forums.
