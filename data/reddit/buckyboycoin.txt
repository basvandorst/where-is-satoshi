Okay, thanks for Your explanation. I think it will not go that far.
Many VC's, Bitcoin Grown up, Outlets and others are into Bitcoin. It will go up and volatile but it need to go for a decent Up. Stable. I'm Long and can effort it, so lets see

Abby. can I invite you for dinner?
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:14:40
You are right. in a few days I will sell my bitcoins. and come back in 1 -2 years. probably price will be the same so why looking a few times a week / sometimes a few times a day what the price / investment is into bitcion.
 
@_date: 2015-06-04 14:24:26

I think you guys are all being too bearish. Yesterday the Chinese government were talking about introducing a "custodian service" for buying and selling Bitcoin - in other words some kind of ETF  What if the current inspections are to ascertain which exchanges to buy from to maintain the ETF ?

it smells the 300 but it will be a roller coaster. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 06:48:53
Bitcoin has to do it on his own. No creek or China. news is over.

Then direction 30 days high. ( + / - 6800)
@_date: 2015-04-25 15:04:26
The power is to control the price. Big guys are in control. See in the Bid / Ask book watch the 64K BTC blocks. it come back all the time. On the Ask. 
even when it hits them then they fill it up to 64K
@_date: 2015-04-11 11:47:43
Because Big Boys with Big $$ are playing with the BTC price. Look at 
When you have Big $$ it is easy to manipulate the Price of BTC.

@_date: 2015-04-01 12:54:27
Maybe I go opposite. Have have Many BTC 100+ but feel last 5 -6 months the pain. Down and Down and Down. 
Many good news. etc but has no reaction on BTC value.More BTC in the news but no reaction. Paying goods in BTC is now more expensive cause the value of BTC gets lower and lower.
@_date: 2015-04-14 15:40:38

Boston-based Circle Internet Financial, with offices in San Francisco, New York, Dublin and London, has 65 employees and customers in more than 100 countries, spokeswoman Sarah Mitchell said. The company won't disclose exact transaction and volume data, but they are seeing "significant consumer demand" globally for its product, which currently enables transactions in U.S. dollars and in bitcoin, she said.
@_date: 2015-04-25 13:50:13
yep. real time 227 - down. Unfortunate
@_date: 2015-04-10 11:47:01
It doesn't matter. going down is the message it looks like. Though I do not like it. 
Not good for existing users / companies who are ok to accept BTC etc. and potential new users. A down spiral.

As regulation for the Bitcoin derivative market becomes more aligned with that of traditional financial markets, there should be wider adoption, which is good for the industry.”
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:38:20
well finally some action. A few days not much action in price
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:37:58
Yes. It is getting boring.
@_date: 2015-04-24 10:33:17
The 64K is there again!! A few hours
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:30:13
then she lost 25% in 30 days BTC value
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:45:40

You ship international?
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:12:21
Indeed, all good news last weeks / months. Companies raise investments, others get listed, banks getting more interested ( AXA etc.etc. ). not much happening with the Bitcoin price. 225 - 250 range for months.
Anyway, I have patience but every day when you open your laptop it is a surprise. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 09:20:58
meaning ... price goes down
@_date: 2015-09-23 11:15:36

Mr Canavan said he called for the investigation because he believed there had been a coordinated attack on the digital currency industry.
"I think the ACCC should be asking the banks some serious questions about why they've done this and on what legal grounds they believe that they should not be providing services to Bitcoin operators," he said.
@_date: 2015-09-10 05:02:05
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:38:29

The Bay Area ( the High Tech Area ) should take the lead in accepting Bitcoins or should have loads 
@_date: 2015-09-11 11:29:25
Maybe right. But this someone has a lot of Bitcoins in $$.

@_date: 2015-04-29 17:25:12
What? ....what?
@_date: 2015-04-14 05:55:09
Correct. As long as you see 64K in at the ASK, look  
it POP UP every time. even when it is hit it will show 64K again.
@_date: 2015-09-11 12:31:05
yep. more then 4.5M bitcoins on the ask. now real time on 241
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:46:51
@_date: 2015-09-16 11:46:47
@_date: 2015-09-24 06:48:48
Yes, A bit "simple" and out dated info
@_date: 2015-09-11 12:13:32
there is something brewing
@_date: 2015-09-09 11:05:37
all good news last days. Value bitcoin doesn't reflect 
@_date: 2015-04-29 15:29:13
The boiling point is that we are down again. Real time 223
@_date: 2015-09-30 16:48:20
@_date: 2015-09-23 05:19:53
@_date: 2015-04-13 15:41:24
LOL. I think many are the same boat. 30 days ago 293 now real time 233. People can talk a lot but this is not good.
 
@_date: 2015-04-25 14:40:55
If you see every time 64K BTC on the ASK in the Bid / Ask book Yes they are
@_date: 2015-04-02 06:55:30
What means HODL
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:08:50

Bitcoin's price is not an advantage. Look now today ( last days ). Houston we have a problem, going direction &lt;200 it looks like.
MANY good news on Bitcoin which is good and I like but it looks like the price does not reflect this.

@_date: 2017-06-09 10:25:26
Good choice. If he has Patience
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:25:19
No. Do not need the money and will wait. Have Big / hugh profit if I cash out but will not do. 
I do not think it is a bubble ( all people talk about it ) I think it is just the beginning at these levels. Yes it will be volatile but if your vision is another 1 - 3 years it will be OK.
@_date: 2017-06-01 06:07:21
where is this?
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:47:22
Well, If he bought BTC 1 or 2 weeks ago he is in the $$ already.
It sounds like you were " fucked"?
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:05:49
I do not think. But your thinking. 
I'm 4 years into BTC's, mainly Bitstamp. Know more people. They are not screwing this up.
And BTC is growing up. To much big players are or getting in. Japan is there, China with there limitations ( although a lot were thinking China would ban BTC's ), Scandinavia, India decision soon, Invest houses,  more interest social media etc. etc. etc. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 11:10:44
Goed werk.
Good job
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:09:36
So you are now FIAT and own no BTC's or Alt's?
@_date: 2017-06-09 11:14:16
Good
