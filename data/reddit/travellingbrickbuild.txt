Which fulfills the advice given. 
Far too many people don’t realise the power of beginning investing early. Most people can afford to take 5% of their pay and throw it into a retirement account; way too few do.

I’ll bet he works a lot less than an 88 year old trying to make ends meet greeting at Walmart

Yeah, that’s rotten of them. Not cool to hide the fee until you’ve committed.

Right. Just like dollars you bury in your backyard cease to be worth anything when you dig them up from cold storage years later. Oh wait. That’s pretty much literally Fed policy.

Luckily, we live in a world where different countries want to compete for business to better their economic situations. If USA bans the sale of BTC, some other (most likely many other) countries will open their arms wide to crypto and revel in the business that comes their way.

Seriously. Switzerland would gladly create a whole new crypto banking industry. As well as Eastern Europe wanna-be and current tech centers.

Welcome to the bitcoin community. And thanks for sharing your story with us. I’m sorry to hear your first foray into the future of money was so frustrating. Don’t let it turn you off of bitcoin. Every business will attract some shady opportunistic types, and currency exchange is no different, especially because the real workings of the system are a mystery to most people.  I lead group tours in Europe and always have to caution my clients not to go the “easy” route and exchange their currency at the souvenir shops. And usually after they’ve done it once and realized the 25%+ premium was a scam they never do that again. Worst I’ve seen was a client who bought GBP at 1.80 USD when the market rate was 1.29 USD. These bitcoin ATMs are just a new variation on the currency exchange profiteers.
