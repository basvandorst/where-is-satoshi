We, the people, should be in control of the future of Bitcoin, not a bunch of "core devs" who would like to be treated like philosopher-kings. is giving the people a choice (in the form of a hard fork); he is not imposing his view on anyone. Quite the contrary: Those that would require "consensus" amongst the philosopher-king "core devs" before the people are presented with a choice are paternalistically trying to impose their view on the community. Let the people (the broader Bitcoin community) decide whether to run Bitcoin-XT or not.

This forum is now officially a complete joke. This censorship is the politburo's last desperate gasp, as it is about to be overthrown by a real revolution.

You've succeeded in making this forum a complete joke. Congratulations. You've lost all credibility.

I very much agree with this post. The same devs that purport to be champions of "decentralization" are actually acting like central planners.
Justus Ranvier's piece on production quotas is relevant here:

I agree with this post. A block size limit is central planning of the worst kind. We need to overthrow this politburo.

As an attorney and as a new lifetime member of the Bitcoin Foundation, I too am appalled by this lawsuit. Regardless of the merits (I have not studied the contract at issue yet), this lawsuit severely undermines the credibility of the Foundation. Vessenes needs to resign IMMEDIATELY.

As an attorney, I respectfully think that requesting a hearing at this point in time is a strategic misstep.
All laws and regulations are full of ambiguities and open questions. The laws and regulations needs time to evolve; sometimes it is better to let a sleeping dog lie.
Let's take a step back and look at the big picture: FinCEN is concerned primarily with money laundering. Mining is not a very effective way to launder money. I think miners are safe for the time being. Mine to your heart's content; don't poke the bear.
