Well, my concern has to do with taxes, specifically. I am not really concerned what Coinbase tracks (even though the IRS could ask to see my records, etc)
I just want to enjoy using Bitcoin without the worry "Is the IRS gonna track down my account and audit me in the future?" Its not like I am buying 500 bitcoin and trying to avoid taxes, but I would like to have like 20 and not be hassled for it.

It was a hypothetical scenario. I do not actually own an IT business that accepts bitcoin payment.
My point is there are companies that do. So your argument that Unit of Account has not been met is invalid because there are businesses who sell their services for Bitcoin.

and how can you not figure out how much a movie ticket or a TV would cost in Bitcoin? Just because you have chosen to use USD instead of British pound or yuan or btc - you can still determine how much it would cost.
You're not really making sense.
Plus the IRS says its a currency and I think they have more sway over the topic than you would. sorry.
"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is aware that “virtual currency” may be used to pay
for goods or services, or held for investment. Virtual currency is a digital representation
of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and/or a store of
value. "

It can be made anonymous from certain parties though. And that is the goal. Not to become 100% anonymous.
I could achieve my goal by buying and selling with person to person, cash transactions only.

Damn. Alright. I am starting to see how easy it is to trace now that I have looked up some of my transactions. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 13:12:09
Quite delightful indeed, good lad. Cheerio.

So 1 guy is stopping the size increase? Why not just take a vote between all major developers attached to the project and majority wins. Tough titties to the loser. (as you can tell, I dont really care either way)

So if I am understanding correctly, the specific amount of BTC I have purchased and sent to my Bread wallet stays the same. Meaning, if I buy .25 bitcoin twice and send both amounts to my Bread wallet, the next time I try to send .5 BTC somewhere - It actually will need to send two .25 transactions and THIS is how Bitcoin can be tracked, correct? Because my .5 transaction will need to reference the proof from the blockchain that I have this amount in my wallet to spend?

"Providing a unit of measurement for defining, recording, and comparing value." (i.e: $1 signifies not only a one dollar bill, but also a dollar's worth of money in other forms of wealth - in other forms other than money). If you took 1 dollar out of that example and inserted 1 BTC, it would still make sense.

It can be made anonymous from certain parties though, which is the goal. In person, cash transactions would achieve this.

I run an IT business. I state "My IT services cost 1 BTC per x hours."
Your unit of account requirement has been fulfilled.
@_date: 2016-01-06 13:59:02
Whatever you feel like you can afford to lose.

Until you started to buy stuff - then they could track your transactions down.
Obviously it would probably take too much work and wouldnt be worth the hassel for such a small amount but I am just going to avoid all of this and buy Bitcoin anonymously going forward.

If I am spending cash that I have earned on Bitcoin - there is ZERO way for the IRS to know I am buying Bitcoin. None.
If I gave some random dude off the street $431 dollars today and had him transfer 1 BTC to a wallet I made offline, there is absolutely no way to tie me to the wallet. I could then sell that BTC for $xxxx cash 10 years later and there is no way for the IRS (or anyone besides the 2 people involved in the transactions) to know who I am.
The only time I would raise suspicion is if I put a huge amount of cash into my bank account which I obviously would not do. 
So I think you are incorrect in your statement that I would not be able to retain my anonymity from certain parties. I am not trying to say it is 100% anonymous.
@_date: 2016-01-06 19:10:06
So, you're telling me the IRS will find me if I buy and sell all my Bitcoin via cash during person to person transactions? Explain.
Any randoms scenario you can think of where I can be tracked, I bet I could use a equally scenario to hide my identity.

Well, Bitcoins are only taxed if I remove them from my wallet and spend them. Captial Gains are applied.
As long as they remain in my wallet and not spent, I will not be taxed for my Bitcoin (from what I understand, please correct me if I am wrong) So I am just moving my Bitcoin off of the Coinbase wallet to a Bread wallet - still not being spent.
But now I have them off of Coinbase - my goal is to mix them and then there is no proof of ownership after that point in time.
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:09:29
Yea. I think I am done buying from Coinbase at this point. All of my future transactions will be to a freshly made wallet and done in a more anonymous approach. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:56:32
haha where is that guy from a post a couple of days ago that said he is waiting to buy low....looks like he is gonna be waitin a while longer and by a while I mean forever.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:21:21
I agree to disagree.
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:24:07
Yea. I am just going to stick what I have in cold storage. I will pay the tax man when he comes knocking.
