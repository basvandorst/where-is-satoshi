Those allegations were to give people a reason to hate him and to influence the court. Originally he was indicted for "procuring murder", but that was dropped. Of course they still factored it in when sentencing, because fuck him, that's why.

Yeah, that's pretty much it.
You buy $100 worth of bitcoin. It goes up in value and is now worth $200. You decide to swap it for another coin.
If you trade it all, you owe capital gains on $100 (your $200 minus what you spent to purchase it).
It is screwed up, but that is how the IRS treats it now. And they don't recognize like kind transactions (switching from one coin to another).
I'm glad I was hodling and buying last year and not trading or selling. The paperwork is not fun.

Not a partner, but family and friends. I used to talk about it a lot in 2013. I told some people (that had the expendable income) to buy some and hold onto it. Nobody did. So I just kind of dropped the subject entirely.
And, oddly, yesterday one of those people asked me how to buy Bitcoin. This is a person that could have easily dropped $5 or $10k back then and now be a multi-millionaire. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:27:32
This is completely wrong.
You do not get taxed until you realize gains. So if you hodl, you are fine. You pay a capital gains tax when you convert the coins into something else. Think of it like a stock split. You have not made any money until you sell.
The big legal gray area right now is like kind transactions. So day trading may or may not end up having a capital gains tax. Same with converting from one coin to another.
Source: I'm one of the 800 or so people that actually bother reporting my gains to the IRS. They haven't had an issue with me.

Hello, fellow 800 club member. Apparently only 800 of us have ever bothered to let the IRS know about gains realized via Bitcoin.
Which is why they are coming down hard now..
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:45:15
You report the gain if you sell. That's all there is to it. It is a standard form. You report how much it costed you initially (and the date you acquired it), and how much you sold it for.
If you are dealing with large volumes (bought or sold), like kind transactions are still kind of a gray area. You need a tax attorney for things like that.
My accountant had no idea what bitcoin was a few years ago. She was up to speed in minutes. It really isn't hard. There is IRS guidance on this. See [here.](

I very much doubt that the coins are gone, but who holds them right now is anyone's guess. There is a fair chance that Gox is insolvent right now. That is awful news for anyone that still had coins in Gox, but everyone has seen this coming for a long time. Why exactly did anyone still have coins in Gox?
This [chart] ( will keep looking suspicious to me until we are positive that the spikes weren't cold storage coins being transferred in to maintain the appearance of solvency.

I've no idea where the author is coming from with that. The best thing to compare bitcoin to is a precious metal, and taxes aren't taken until gains are realized.
But taxing bitcoin is very confusing in the first place. I cashed in a small amount a couple of years ago, and I declared it on my taxes. Fortunately with the help of an accountant. There isn't an easy way to explain that I mined them for nothing when they were worth nothing and used some when they were worth hundreds of dollars each. My accountant now understands the basics and the IRS accepted the return, but obviously they are having a hard time adapting to cryptocurrency.

@_date: 2016-11-26 18:47:34
The government hasn't wrapped their heads around bitcoin yet. For tax purposes they are treating it like a precious metal. Which is awful if you are trying to keep accurate tax records. You are supposed to keep track of every little thing including coffee purchases. On top of that you are supposed to know the value of the bitcoin you are spending was when you obtained it. Bitcoin is fungible - if I mined a block of 50 and later purchased some more for real money, which ones am I spending?

And it backfired in an amazing way.  The rules got simplified, and now the game itself prints money. Everyone, at least in the US, has heard of it and has probably played.  
And not once, not even once during any of those games, did a kid say, "wow, this really demonstrates a fundamental problem with capitalism and that the working class is being exploited by wealthy property owners."
No, everyone knows the game is about making as much money as possible and forcing your opponents into bankruptcy. Making deals and then breaking them when it benefits you most. Stealing money from the bank if at all possible.  Doing anything just to win.
It is a very American game.

You deal with it in the same way you would classified information. An airgapped computer in a secure room to create the wallet, at least two people present to make sure nobody copies the private key onto paper, backups go into secure safes at other locations.

The Coinbase case has nothing to do (directly) with filing with the IRS. The IRS put out [guidance]( a few years ago that outlines how to deal with Bitcoin. You are required to report if you have realized any gains by trading for money or spending it.
So if I buy a bitcoin for $1000, wait a month and it is worth $1100, then spend it all on an Amazon gift card, I've just realized a $100 gain which is taxable.
Yes, it is a pain, and would be very inconvenient if you move a lot of coins around. At this point most people don't bother. That's why the IRS wants Coinbase's records. Only about 800 people a year have actually declared Bitcoin on their taxes. I'm one of them because I do too much work for the government to jeopardize things over a few dollars. But the IRS wants everybody to declare it, and getting the Coinbase data would let them send out a lot of letters..

It is in an [IRS affidavit]( 
*The IRS searched the MTRDB for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015. I received the results of those searches.

They offer all of the services of a bank, but they don't suck. They are generally owned by the members. The employees are usually nicer because they haven't been trained to hate you.

It is not a ponzi scheme. This is something said by people that haven't bothered to understand how it works. You can dislike or disagree with bitcoin, but it does not qualify as a ponzi scheme.
There can only be 21 million whole coins (and that won't even happen for 100+ years from now). But the coins are divisible. You can own .0000001 bitcoin now if you want. If, in the future, that is still not a small enough amount, more decimal places can be added.

There was one very, very blatant thing she missed. It takes minutes of research to realize that Satoshi's English is pretty much perfect and Dorian's is not. Satoshi writes like an academic. Dorian writes like English is not his first language.

If you are cashing out that much, get an accountant. Mine handled bitcoin with no problem even though she had never heard of it before. She just needed estimated date of purchase of the coins, value at that time, and how much money was made during the sale.

It's a nice device, but I don't like the tone of the page. Starting with the title that makes it seem like there is a huge vulnerability in TOTP, then this verbage:
*...a hacker cannot simply steal the entire databases to get access. Instead, he has to target individual users and that is much more costly and time-consuming.*
That is disingenuous. Anyone implementing TOTP knows enough to salt the hashes. With a proper salt you still need to attack each user individually.
Another very misleading line:
*By using TOTP, you have to trust the providers to be able to protect the secret.*
Yes, you do have to trust the provider. But you are also trusting the provider to accept your authentication. It doesn't matter how secure your authentication system is; ultimately the provider decides to authenticate you or not.

Bitcoin is stateless. It isn't beholden to any particular government. What do you do if the Chinese government says you are doing something illegal but the US government says you aren't? Who gets to decide you are a criminal?
There will obviously be edge cases, but the decision of legality should not rest with any particular company. This is a classic slippery slope case. If I have an unpaid speeding ticket in Brazil, can my account be charged? Or if I go to Spain, can the government there get a list of my transactions just in case I might have broken a law?
It completely makes sense why BTC-E would cooperate in this particular case. But it only goes downhill from here.
