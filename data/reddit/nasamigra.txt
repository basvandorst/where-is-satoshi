Do you think value of BTC will keep raising until the end of the days? Of course not, it will eventually drop. Maybe it'll drop slowly, maybe over night

Because in economy the value of something does not keep raising forever, and it doesnt maintain on the same level forever.

So you mean bitcoin price could endlessly keep going up? Maybe even stay at 19k forever? That is impossible, and you just have to see what happened other times in history: the tulips bubble I mentioned, the 2001 NASDAQ bubble, the 80s Wall Street bubble... Bitcoin is definitely a bubble and that's because at some point it's value will drop. If it wasn't a bubble, it's value would either keep increasing, in which case everyone investing in bitcoins would become millionaire, or maintain constant, which would mean that nobody is selling or buying more Bitcoins. Do you really think it's value will keep increasing forever?

As I said, I'm not comparing tulips with currency, that'd be stupid, I'm comparing the speculation around it that has created a big bubble in both cases. Again, NOT comparing tulips with digital currency, of course tulips have nothing to do with bitcoins....

As I said before, English isn't my mother tongue and you're making this argument quite complicated for me using difficult vocabulary but anyways, the tulips analogy is just an EXAMPLE of a especulative Bubble, where 1 flower could get as expensive as a worker's year salary. I don't understand wym by "reaching the instrinsic value of Bitcoin" but if you mean it's value can still raise, I agree, BUT that won't last for ever and it'll eventually drop and that will create a bubble

It certainly is a bubble. I'm sorry I don't have a great vocabulary bc English isn't my mother tongue, but every single time that prices go up due to a expeculation, they go down again. You just have to take as an example past bubbles such as the late 90s or even the tulips bubble in the 1636. We know for a fact that eventually BTC's value will drop, but we don't know when. Maybe the BTC bubble has just started, maybe it's about to pop. Maybe 1 BTC can get to $1 million in a year, maybe it drops back to 10k or 5k.
