This is a great idea!  We should take this idea and apply it to the blockchain.  By building a "tab" locally then pushing a single transaction later, you could both lower fees and increase the percieved transaction speed.  It would be lightning fast!  We need a catchy name though, what do you think we should call it?

Correct.  Converting BTC counts as a taxable event.  Whether that's for USD, USDT, or any goods/services.
If you have the income level to harvest gains on BTC, that seems like a very prudent idea.

It might actually be beneficial because I believe normal capital gains are still 0% on the bottom 2 brackets of the purposed change to brackets of 0/12/25/35/40.  With 25% being $45,000+.  That would be up from the current $37,950 number.

Here's a great article on doing just this.
$37,950 + deductions.
Standard deduction (single): $6,450.
Personal Exemption: $4,050.
So $48,350.
Married? Kids?, you can easily earn 100k with zero federal tax obligation.  Don't forget state taxes though.  Some states don't differentiate income vs capital gains.
Also worth noting is capital gains taxes are marginal just like ordinary income.  If you have $0 ordinary income, you still pay 0$ on that first $37,950.  And only 15% on amounts over that.

This is a really great article.  Would make a good documentary.

Thanks for the reply, I'm from Iowa so wanted to get a better understanding of what's going on.

This is what I don't understand.  This bill (S1241) has nothing to do with the legality or regulation of bitcoin/bitcoin users, as far as I can tell.  It has to do only with reporting requirements for 3rd parties involved in transactions that act as intermediaries on your behalf.  
This bill is simply adding digital currency exchanges to be subject to the same requirements other "financial agency" (as defined in the current law) already are.  Banks, lenders, cash transmitters, credit card and insurance companies, vehicle sellers, pawn stores, etc.
Unless I'm not understanding the full consequences of the "RECORDS AND REPORTS ON MONETARY INSTRUMENTS TRANSACTIONS" (US Code Title 31 Subtitle IV Chapter 53 Subchapter II which Bill S1241 proposes to amend).
Maybe to better understand this instead of asking why this is bad for bitcoin, maybe can someone explain why bitcoin exchanges should be exempt from these reporting requirements?

Is there anyone that understands US Code Title 31 Subtitle IV Chapter 53 Subchapter II well enough to explain this.
I've been reading through it but there's a lot to take in.  Basically this amendment would include digital currency exchanges in some reporting requirements and if they transmit funds they have to register as money transmitters.
Why are these bad things?
