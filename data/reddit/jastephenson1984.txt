Is it worth it? How much could current fees eat away from that amount?

I'm already set to super economy and the current interest in by has me worried that I won't ever be able to send the btc I own for money. Because ill never have enough to cover the minimum payment. Is that possible?

Yeah as if people won't continue to go bullish on bitcoin when it crashes!

This is why I only comfortably drop 10 dollars a month on btc. But with the current market trend in thinking of doing litecoin for such small transactions. I have to say this is more a hobby for me. I truly feel like I missed that opportunity to really prosper. Now I'm only interested in the technology and I get a tiny kick out if watching what my small transactions can do. It's two part penny jar and one part gambling.

To clarify I am saying that they will continue... before I get like 90 notifications on my phone from people telling me I don't understand how this works

As someone that is also a newbie and doesn't know how hard forks work I am curious about that as well
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:01:54
That's precisely my thinking.

With a decent job I plan to put in a lot more than 10 dollars per month.
