No. Everything that can be traded of any value should be completely regulated and tracked. We need to know every time value passes from one person to another. Before you even think about flushing your shit and sending it down the drain to the city sewer, you should make sure you get the name, address, social security number, finger prints and blood sample of the guy collecting your shit on the other end. After all, he might be converting it into beautiful fertilizer, which could be given to someone to grow corn, which he could trade for gasoline to fill his tractor, which could actually be used to burn down someone's house. And he might scream that he is doing this in the name of Peter Pan, so we all better watch out.

There are plenty of indications that people are moving out of dollars to something else. There have been a number of instances involving China, Russia, India, Brazil, Australia, etc... where countries are moving to trade agreements that exclude the US Dollar. Have you heard of BRICS?

Why do you automatically default to "... kinda went off the deep end there."?  I am asking logical questions. Mark hasn't been convicted of running a Ponzi, so as far as I'm concerned, there doesn't appear to be enough evidence.
Variety Jones wasn't "caught." There is evidence that at least one person that used the moniker is tied to Silk Road. Strange this is that he offered himself up to prosecution in New York either fearing for his life or because he felt sorry for innocent people being hurt. Stranger still is that many months passed before he was arrested in Thailand. There are fishy things about this story on both sides. I am not sure he has been extradited to the US. Can you show me a link or something on this? I would certainly like to see clear cut evidence that he was 100% solely responsible for all of the Variety Jones activity in Silk Road. Unfortunately, it has been shown that government officials tampered with the situation so I think it's going to be difficult to prove.
Who is Mr. Big? Supposedly someone by this code name owed Trendon Shavers a load of Bitcoin, and never paid up, putting Bitcoin Savings and Trust into negative territory. Trendon then made the error of continuing business to try to save the entire operation, which put him into an illegal status of running a ponzi - by accident.
You could be right that Mark sold some BTC for 50 cents. The person that purchased the Bitcoin can easily come forward and share his/her story. They did nothing illegal, so there would be no issues for them. Further, there should be a transaction in the Blockchain to show this. Also, it would be quite easy to follow the cash side transactions as well. Why is he still walking? Why is he under gag order? Why is Trendon under gag order? Why haven't we heard from POM in a few months?
There is much left to be told of this story. Movie in the making... 
If you believe Bitcoin will even come close to becoming the world's default store of value, this is history in the making.

Do you have proof of Mark stealing money? It appears that the matter is still unresolved and it is more likely that someone else has the money. Why would Mark try to steal the money? Either he was running a ponzi (similar to the current fiat banking system) or he was running a profitable business. I tend to feel that it was a profitable business based on all of the evidence given. With that said, he could have run into issues like Tendon Shavers where another party came up short and effectively put the business into a negative equity position. Who is Mr. Big? Who is Variety Jones? What is happening with The Plural of Mongoose? These are all critical questions that lead to all of that missing Bitcoin and FIAT!

Shill warning people: do you're research. Ross was at least partially guilty, but this story goes much deeper and he was used as an example. oh, and Ross isn't taking tax money to protect us. Force and Bridges did, as did the folks that hired them. Millions of tax payers never entrusted Ross with anything, so there was no trust or stewardship that was broken. These two federal gems did. We trusted them with our livelihood and they abused it. Life for Ross and a few years for each of them?
They also "broke the law." It's just, when they broke it, they literally broke it.

Kobayashi can expose the MtGox addresses and transaction IDs for all of the missing Bitcoin - so at the very least we have a path to follow. We will also know the exact amount of the lost Bitcoin. Not sharing this information in the name of privacy is not only a farce, but an insult to the intelligence of the entire Bitcoin community. It is also an act of being an accessory to the crime.

Thanks for the info! Do you have any reference to the "possibly payout bitcoin as bitcoin" or was this stated in the proceedings?
@_date: 2014-07-23 08:08:04
Consider this: 1) It is possible that thee are only 200k in Bitcoin claims. (Maybe 650k of the claims are ficticious). 2) If they are real, the administrator has the addresses, and therefore the subsequent addresses. We can now assume Deloitte &amp; Touche have them as well. DrApricot has a great theory on this. Asset stripping by banks internationally. Slow the deposits, speed up the withdrawels. Eventually, there will not be enough FIAT for MtGox to pay out as needed.

"Ask forgiveness, not permission. That’s the no-holds-barred philosophy in bitcoin-land, where developers tend to write software and entrepreneurs tend to build businesses first, without seeking approval from regulators."
“If you’re the SEC and you want to create new precedent here, do you go after the obvious scammer or a vibrant technology?” he asked. “You go after the guy who no one is sympathetic for.”

To explain a little further; with so many around us only accepting USD, we have to maintain some USD to interact with them. But I believe that Bitcoin has a better than 50% chance of outperforming ALL government backed fiats. Now, you have to look at your own situation to determine how much risk you are taking in holding dollars or crypto. Your age, ability to recover from the loss, fiat dollar needs in the next day, week, month, year, decade, and so on, all count.

In the case of Ethereum, the "lesser valued" (ETC) version is the original, from my understanding. Many of those that hold on to ETC were in the "Code is King" camp, where a large value (via DAO) was seized by someone that found an exploit in the original Ethereum. I think there is "real" adoption there, but certainly less than the fork (ETH) where the code was repaired to return the seized DAO. 
It interesting to note that the community opted to call the situation a hack, and that the code was originally broken. While I didn't follow the Ethereum camp much before the incident, it appeared that this was a classic example of where the majority would rather sacrifice their moral (Code is King) rather than lose their assets.
Bitcoin is in a completely different situation now, as there appears to be arguments for both forks and each side claiming theirs is the true "Bitcoin." Personally, while I would not like to see a fork, I also do not like to see the stagnation. In my mind, Bitcoin was Satoshi's creation, and everything since is an altcoin. This includes both BU and BC. Not that there's anything wrong with that.

I really don't know. I don't know him and what he is thinking. But, I do see validity to having larger blocks, in that more people can get their hand on Bitcoin easier. If more people have Bitcoin, they will play with it, learn about it, and do their best to protect it (assuming they like it.) Or, we could try to keep Bitcoin in the hands of only a few, and make everyone else use derivatives of Bitcoin (lighting). Most people would be fine with this. But then there's going to be a whole generation of people that never had a chance to get their hands on Bitcoin, and they're just going to create their own. If you want Bitcoin to success, it needs to be in the hands of the many, not the few. Cash - fiat or crypto - has more value when more people understand it and want it.
That's not to say that lightning and segwit are not great tools. I like both. I like Luke-Jr, idea of smaller blocks, and I like the idea of larger blocks. Both directions are great and I think overall the community needs to stop complaining and just be happy with one direction, the other, or both (fork). I know I am. HODLer here.

I believe that Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are superior to existing FIAT currencies. Far superior. When was the last time that you had to do 2FA for your bank account? The reason you have not needed to is because FIAT is much easier for a central authority to "print and replace." You can't do that with gold or Bitcoin. That is why we need more defensive protections for gold and Bitcoin. And this is just the supply/demand advantage. There are untold technical, logistic, and contractual advantages coming with cryptocurrencies. 
More and more people are discovering this and "taking more risk" by putting their savings (purchasing power and wealth) into cryptocurrencies. For me, it is not a matter of IF, but WHEN. The rate at which people are learning about and trying Bitcoin is at a point where I think the $1350 will be cheap in two months.

No problem with a fork here, other than it dilutes the pool of people working on the protocol. Eventually, I think it will be very important to have alternatives.

Allowing second layers today will reduce the number of people that understand the core bitcoin protocol in the future. If Segwit is launched, then a programmer that might otherwise try to solve a problem on-chain will now have an off-chain solution to gravitate to first, and may never dive deep into the base code. While I am all for the ability for people to choose, I am merely pointing out that this will have the result of shrinking the number of people that understand and can program Bitcoin at its "core" level. 
Regarding hardforks, having a safe contingency plan for one should be a constant at this point. Today it is block size, in the future it will be something else. There will always be an individual or group of people that want something that the majority do not, and they'll fork it. This is one thing that I think is a given, and something that we should not necessarily discourage.

Several years ago I was in China and asked a young Chinese man (20 something) if he knew of Bitcoin, and surprisingly the answer was "yes." He continued that it was "getting popular" and that Chinese are trading and making money from it. Asked if he used it, he said no, and did not seem to have interest. So, while this is anecdotal, my hunch is that the Chinese were a little faster to adopt than Americans.

There is talk that MtGox may be resurrected from the dead to return more than the fixed ($483) payout should the total asset JPY value surpass the total JPY liability value. Again, this is based on $483, as the return of the actual Bitcoin value would only happen if the "temporarily" is removed from the "unavailable" Bitcoin.

Thank you for sharing this OP. A great project for us to understand the power of brute force in this case. 
The entire Blockchain reminds me of the old Y2K problem. If we don't keep the technology updated, we can run into problems. If this system starts to see success, I imagine we'll start having the Bitcoin addresses and private keys regenerate frequently enough that the brute force systems need to continuously restart. Sort of a cat and mouse game. 
One thing I really like about Bitcoin and the Blockchain is that it is so secure. I wonder how quickly the LBC could start popping off passwords to bank accounts and creating all sorts of transactions. Personally, I am of the camp that people that understand how fragile our entire banking system is are the ones that created Bitcoin. It has to be relatively easy with this kind of processing power to create complete chaos of our current banking systems. Whenever newbies ask me about security, I just ask them when the last time was they they needed to use 2FA on their bank account. (Now were finally starting to see it.)
Question for the curious:
+What does it cost to set something like this up? What are the ongoing maintenance (electricity/renewing hardware) costs?

I do not believe that I am re-framing the context. Who is to decide the morality of actors? The whole point of Bitcoin was to eliminate bad actors. If Bitcoin doesn't accomplish this, then it's a failed experiment. Personally, I think Bitcoin is working fabulously. I am not opposed to a fork to see both sides flourish in their efforts. If the fees get too high, it will limit the value of the currency. If internal actors can destroy the network effectiveness by mining empty blocks, then it will limit the value of the currency. If the miners begin to work against the users, it will limit the value of the currency. But in all of these cases, the currency is still very straight forward and a far superior solution to what most people are using today: fiat.

Not being technical enough, I tried to remain nuetral on these issues until I understand enough, which may be never...though I am not opposed to a hard fork to stop the bickering and see both sides grow on their own. We have much larger problems ahead that techs may not even see.
With that said, if you are technical, why rely on whether Craig Wright can sign or move coin from thr first block? You have everything you need to see how the software and hardware functions.

Thanks for sharing. Learned a little bit more about Dash. Didn't realize they are splitting up the incentives so much. I don't like the premine aspect, but I've always wondered about who Satoshi is and his/her/their incentive.
Saw this and found it interesting.  I assume Core and Unlimited are watching this. Dash is looking to make a solid run for the top. (As did Steem, Monero, etc.. etc...) 
Just remember that security doesn't only come in the form of code, but also human hands and minds. In fact, if everything gets unplugged, all that is left is human hands and minds, so it's a really good idea to have as many on your side as you can have.

Even if this is true, that doesn't necessarily mean that BU is a bad implementation of Bitcoin. The same argument could be made about Core, only going back much further.

I "lost money" on MtGox, and can assure you that no laws prevented the laws, and so far, no laws have helped return the Bitcoin to me. There is strong evidence suggesting that there were laws that prevented the operator of MtGox to tell his story (gag order). There were also laws that gave "government officials" permission to gain inside information, which they used to steal from the general public in the Silk Road case which is related to MtGox. And sadly, there are laws that keep the whole truth from coming out on all of it, resulting in multiple incarcerations that we will always wonder if they were justified or not.

There were plenty of holders that could have sold at that price. Were they also tricked? One player doesn't determine the value, the market does, or each individual for themselves rather.

Well, we have two technical philosophies that split the chain just now. And there might be underlying political tones as well. I don't know enough about the technology to make this assumption, but it certainly feels this way. 
Beyond this, I can see a day where people only se/spend/accept money that is in line with their personal philosophies. Conservative coin vs Liberal coin vs Libertarian coin vs... and so on. Maybe you have communist coin, conservation coin, etc... We have already seen some of this in the cryptocurrency world. This can allow freedom of choice / voluntary governance.

Willy Bot was not the only reason for the price increase. Plenty of people paid for Bitcoin at those high levels, and plenty of people did not sell at those high levels.

I was not tricked. I would have never exchanged my Bitcoin at $1200 USD. There were relatively very few Bitcoin available to purchase at that rate. Much like today, how many Bitcoin do you think you can purchase at $3000/BTC? There are bots influencing BTC exchanges today, bots influencing the stock market, bots influencing USD/EUR/CNY etc... Each bot represents one or more traders, but only ONE thought process for each. This is free market because no one was FORCED to buy or sell. Anyone could have freely bought or sold, but they didn't.
Also, there are claims that the Bitcoin did not exist, but much more proof that it did exist. There is an ongoing investigation, nothing public is definitive yet. At the moment very few people know what actually happened.

While the exchange rate is an indicator, it is not fool proof. Since fiat money can be infinitely printed, exchange rate is not a good measurement for confidence. A fiat-driven attack could easily make a currency "appear" to be more valuable.

Bitcoin is a public, and FREE to use, open source system that measures and transfers value. In its simplest form, Bitcoin is real money. Because it is open source, anyone can examine the code or suggest improvements that can be implemented if a majority of users agree. The Bitcoin supply is limited and defined by software, so there are no decisions made in a black box, or by a handful of people. It works because very smart people worldwide trust it, and accept it as a form of payment and store of value.

The "lost" purchasing power may increase or decrease over time. But they only changed their measuring stick, much like you presumably went from fiat to Bitcoin. At that initial moment, you did not lose money, only changed to a different "measuring stick" and in the instant of the trade, had not lost or gained purchasing power. Assuming you've been in Bitcoin for more than a month, you have gained purchasing power.

GBTC has been very nice to me. However, know what your buying. They claim that the Bitcoin cash side may be sold, and they will focus on the Segwit2x chain. This strikes me as playing politics with my money. What happens if Bitcoin Core splits off from Segwit2x like they say they fully intend to do? Will holders get only half of that?

Yep. Turns out I would be about 1 hour older. It cost .0005 BCH to send $1. 
Since you refuse to answer my question, I assume that you already know what would happen if you tried to send $1 on Bitcoin Segwit. You know that it would take longer and cost more.

If Bitcoin Cash is unused, we don't need to worry about its value. Same goes for Bitcoin Segwit. Nothing is of any value if it is not used. Well, maybe pure speculation value. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 03:36:15


Your assumption is wrong. I am fully aware that LN fees can be as cheap as free if I want to let people use my network for free. Does free count as "insanely low" enough for you?
LN transactions are not on the Bitcoin network. They are off-chain. So... they are a derivative. Their value is derived from another source...Bitcoin. I am not against this at all. 
Let's go back to why we're having this conversation:


First, this is simply not true, and I would be happy to show you examples if you want them. Furthermore, since Bitcoin Segwit via Lighting Network has not been implemented yet, your remark, "Go ahead ... shit, you can't. Nobody accepts BCH!" applies moreso to Lighting Network.
Assuming you are pro-Segwit and LN, you should be very happy about this, as am I. It is just a different approach, attacking a different problem. But there is no need to knock Bitcoin Cash, right?
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:07:09

It wasn't always like this, and it doesn't need to be like this. If cash buyers/sellers wish, they can just file the transaction with the local county.

Probably because he is heavily invested in Bitcoin AND wants you to pay for his early fortune.
Your thought is not a bad idea, but you will loose a lot of the advantages of Bitcoin. For example if it is country dependent, then it can be co-opted by a government. Also, transacting between countries become a problem. In a way, this recent fork (and those that preceded) do have the effect of distributing the money supply and control. It requires hash power (computers) to support. I've said for some time now that I think eventually we will have philosophically based monetary systems. This is just the beginning.

@_date: 2017-08-21 05:16:18
lol, you caught me in "old school" thinking. Let me re-phrase that.
Why do you say that? Bitcoin Cash is transferring actual Bitcoin, and currently for a much lower cost than Bitcoin Segwit. Bitcoin Segwit transaction fees are much larger, and if it goes 1x, will get even larger. This is one of the purposes of LN, to bundle a bunch of transactions into one and share the fees. So, much link PayPal is not fiat, and only acts as an agent of fiat, Lighting Network will not be real Bitcoin, but only act as the agent of real Bitcoin. 
So do you have comments now?
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:08:14
It is going to get more expensive than that until Lighting Networks are installed. Or unless you use another type of currency.
But entities like Coinbase need to be paid and should. Nothing is free.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:21:00
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:55:55
You're right, Bitcoin can continue with high fees. Fewer transactions that are specialized between thrid party money providers. It's worked great for the last 100 years. The big difference is that Bitcoin will hold these third party money providers accountable and prevent cheating, so it will be much better.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:07:48
Maybe someone is trying to tell Coinbase something.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:10:43


Agreed, but this two party system has resulted in a political divide in the US that feels on the verge of a civil war. Over what? Political parties, and not much more. So, any politician that starts by joining one of the two major parties to "help" are really only exacerbating the situation. They are sacrificing their beliefs for power. That is why they "start out good" but then become "corrupt." They are not corrupt at the top, they are stuck. The corruption starts at the very bottom when they sign up for the free power/money, sacrificing their personal goals.

I beg to differ. Both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Segwit have shown that they can be changed. They both came from Bitcoin but changed into something different. They both have the same mother. To deny Bitcoin Cash has the same genetic makeup is to deny a sibling.

I am fully aware that anything can be broadcast on the Blockchain, including images of Ben Bernake. However, that doesn't every LN transaction will be.

Don't expect a discount just because it's Bitcoin. Yes, that would be great, but the market is the market. I agree that people need to focus on selling things for Bitcoin, but here's the deal. Everyone on this board has Bitcoin, and either they are already selling something for Bitcoin (see point  in OP), or they are just buying Bitcoin. If we want the rest of the world to accept Bitcoin, we need to just ask. That is why the people reading this need to focus on SPENDING Bitcoin. You can always get rid of your fiat by buying it on the markets. Yes, it is work, but education is very expensive and we all need to pitch in. Business owners (or commissioned sales people) are incentivized to learn if they have a big purchase coming.

This is the beauty of a corporation without a state. Look to the origins of the corporation when several men pooled their money to send a ship over the Atlantic and reaped the benefits once the ship returned. The corporation was then dissolved. 
Corporations are nothing more than VOLUNTARY agreements. Much like Bitcoin is voluntary - you may use it or not - at your own risk, corporations you may use at your own risk. You may be a customer, owner, supplier, employee, or some other stakeholder in a corporation, and it is completely voluntary. You may leave anytime you like (though there may be assets or liabilities that have accrued during your agreement with the corporation). 
There is no reason a state needs to recognize or even deal with a corporation. The minute a state does, it absolves people of responsibility, and therefore liability. Whoever promoted and put into law that a corporation has a life and is like a person pulled one over on the public.
I am very pro-business, but there will always be a conflict of interest where a state recognizes a corporation.

I don't think MtGox cared whether the Bitcoin was used for speculation or payments; it was agnostic towards that end. My first MtGox exchange was to purchase Bitcoin that I pulled out of the exchange to make a purchase that was completely unrelated to drugs or any other "illicit" activity.
Illicit activity sellers were attracted to Bitcoin because it streamlined their operations and in some ways made it safer for the sellers. Regarding the speculation, it is no more speculative to hold Bitcoin than to hold fiat, and maybe even less so considering the math behind both.
Satoshi had completed his job by Dec 2010. There were many possible outcomes back then that would have been reason enough to go into hiding. He knew before he started that he would be hiding.

I am not sure I understand either of your sentences. 


What costs are you referring to? Using USD and other fiat typically results in lost spending power through the "printing of money". Generally Bitcoin doesn't do this, and when it does, there is a clear line of responsibility and the risk taker pays, not everyone.


Can you please be more clear on this question. In some ways, both small blockers and large blockers want to keep the block size fixed for the time being. I think both sides feel that transactions will be cheaper in the future. It's just that with one, the user will be responsible for the "value", where as the other will create custodial accounts for the "value".
I feel people will learn to be more responsible and more aware of their surroundings if they hold the value. I also feel that most people don't want that responsibility. This is why I like the fork. It gives us both option, and free will to choose.

More importantly, we KNOW that Bitcoin Cash can only go to 21,000,000, so even if there ever is hyperinflation, all that means is that there may be a short term "sale" on Bitcoin Cash if the exchange rate does drop. Both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Segwit will have the same end count.

Not sure about that. I think there is very good reason for what this sub likes to call "BCash" to go up. And I am critical of both sides. 
Actually, I think there is great reason for both sides to jump up. It's just that psychological number is much easier to swollow on BCash than on Bitcoin. Both are working, right?
Edit: I do want to point out that there is a very hefty "unknown" minor presence in BCash that to date is inexplicable, and risky.

I just spent three hours between two banks. One said they sent the wire, the other said they have absolutely no record of it. This started when the wire was "sent" on Monday. Nothing Tuesday. Wednesday. Calls...yes. We sent it. Check with C Bank. C Bank says, nope. Nothing at all received. No indications. Back to W Bank. Yes, we sent it. C Bank said they put a stop on it for fraud protection. Back to C Bank... no. No indication. Check with W bank. What can I speak to someone in the compliance department? No? Why not? Back to W Bank. We sent it. Can you provide proof? Nope. We received an email from C Bank's Compliance indicating that wire was received, but that they put a hold on it because they thought it was fraudulent. Check with them. I tried. Can I have the email from C Bank so I can show C Bank? No. This is internal records. So, you, W Bank claim to have sent the wire, and C Bank claims they did not receive it. How the hell am I supposed to know who is telling the truth and who has clearly failed if neither of you can show proof? (Thinking about blockchain about now.) Can we call C Bank together to sort this out? Nope.
This is why I will walk in and pull every dime out of that account and close it. What a waste of time.

It's arguable that nobody should bet everything on anything, but each person's situation is different. I am not suggesting that people do bet everything on Bitcoin, but if they do, maybe it's best for them. Some people put their entire 401k in a giant complex financial market with layers and layers of players, regulations, education and military force, all of which comes with costs extracting value. Oh yes, and all if which is being measured by a yard stick controlled by a small handful of people that can stretch or compress that yardstick at any time. It might be okay for them too. Since we don't know their goals or the context of their lives or decisions, I'd like to suggest a little humility.
Oh yeah, and I agree, Bitcoin doesn't need any of this to work. It strikes me as pretty solid. Sure, it has weakness, but doesn't everything?

Both chains stop at 21 million, so both have pre-determined inflation peaks. The rates of each will adjust between now and then. If miners oversell, then that is a good time to buy, assuming the chain is used. Which, we've come to a point where the network effect is yet to be determined for both. Bitcoin Segwit is taking the legacy system and applying new rules and Bitcoin Cash must retweak the legacy systems to fit the old rules. It is too early to tell which will be adopted by individuals worldwide and provide more value. Both will be used.

With all due respect Luke, I beg to differ. You are a technologist and know full well that there is more than one chain. You can hold the opinion that only one is worthwhile, or worthy, and that the other is completely worthless, and maybe even trash. But the fact remains that there is more than one derivative of Bitcoin.
More importantly, I am ALL IN on Bitcoin, and have been. But I think it is very important that we don't put all of our eggs in one basket. For the safety and security of mankind there needs to be competing chains. While I benefit greatly from Bitcoin's success, to force or even suggest to the world to use Bitcoin only sets a very dangerous precedent. I hope you are with me on this one.

Who said anything about "one man"? Also, I don't think the paper said anything about how the technology should evolve. Only what it is, and can be. 


The paper was not only a technical argument, but a philosophical one. It just so happens that the technology works and works very very well. Will it be improved? Maybe. Will it be forked? It has and probably will again. Is it not a good technical argument? If it is not a good technical argument, then again, why are we here? Why are so many people building on it?

I certainly think that is feasible. Names are pretty arbitrary, as we are seeing now. What is really important is the underlying code, and how people interact with it. As far as being just as decentralized, it could happen, but with a name like BitcoinCanada, it probably would not be. Names alone can influence who uses it. (In fact, the name, while pretty arbitrary to how it actually works, probably has more impact on who uses a coin than the actual technology.) People simply do not have time or resources to study everything that impacts their lives.

Aren't they forcing currency exchange? Declaring the paper bills illegal tender certainly is deflationary, but there is news about exchanging it. I haven't seen the high level policy, so don't know the metrics behind the madness, but apparently shops are accepting cash for goods. If there is a rush to get rid of the cash in exchange for the goods, then that will create inflationary results.
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:43:27
Which one? If Australia phases out paper, but not digital money, then this forces the ongoing transactions to go digital. It is self evident. Regarding pushing transactions into Bitcoin, I use the term "may" twice, because I do not know. It is something we should keep an eye on, not because I fear that Bitcoin can be taxed and used to fund government; but because next steps might be to reduce privacy, force taxation and increase spending that is not helpful or desired by the general public, and possibly block the use of Bitcoin for individuals that don't comply.
I do not have any evidence that this is what the individuals in Australia that pushed this removal if paper are thinking. I suspect that they are not. However, this line of thinking (Let's control the measuring stick) will be used in any other form of money or societal influence.

Furthermore, this outside entity may have jumped in just before the fork because it knew the fork (and subsequent scaling) was going to happen soon.

They will need more than money. They need to find a way to create and export it, or build something and sell within. Bitcoin can grease the wheels, but it won't make it go. In your efforts, see if there are any manufacturers that can export for Bitcoin. (It would be great to see barrels of oil sold for BTC). Some good How To's would be helpful in the site as well. How to grow food, how to do a Boolean Search using Google, how to export goods, how to set up a OpenBazaar.org store, how to set up a new government....

I remember when these kind of announcements used to be greeted with pleasure in this forum. If Microsoft, Dell, Overstock, Expedia and Dish never accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment it would be worth far less. Very few people have Bitcoin right now, so when 260,000 stores start accepting Bitcoin, it mostly creates more demand and value for Bitcoin for those that already have it. And if new people do adopt, Bitcoin becomes that much stronger. Japan is being very smart about this by getting their public using Bitcoin now; letting people learn about the cost of banking, transferring value, etc...  Losing a couple bucks on a $5 coffee it a very inexpensive education on how the world monetary system works. There will be plenty of people that think it's a rip-off and get out of Bitcoin, and there will be people that will ask questions and learn more about Bitcoin and what it can do for the world.

@ u/arcrad: When someone uses Visa, they are transferring value in the form of fiat. The recipient is asking for USD for example. I am not even sure Visa ever takes or has possession of those Dollars. They simply allow both sides (buyer/seller) to make journal entries to transfer the value (Dollars). In the case of Bitcoin, the value can be the Bitcoin itself. Agreed that this doesn't happen all of the time, but it often does happen. When it does, it is being treated as a currency - which is only one of it's properties.
@ u/BlackBeltBob: Why do you think the possibility of using Bitcoin to pay for coffees will never happen? I assume you mean on-chain only. If Bitcoin does not handle the coffee transactions, then some other cryptocurrency eventually will. It may be backed by Bitcoin or the Blockchain network, or it may have it's own Blockchain. I think the years of fiat are limited.

I do not care whether we have Segwit or not. I think both directions work great. ESPECIALLY FOR ON BOARDING THE NEXT 5 MILLION PEOPLE. There is nothing wrong with either direction. There are many alts that can serve the purpose that Bitcoin serves now, and will serve in the future. I do think that protecting Bitcoin is the  priority here. That protection can come in different forms: good clean unbreakable code and distributed hash power seem reasonable for this. But on top of this we need people! People to code, people to build, and people to defend. This is why I feel that we need to get Bitcoin in more hands, because once it's in their hands, they will work with it and defend it.

Agreed. The whole financial system is stacked with laws that inflate the value of the paper equities market. But I didn't know that when I started the Roth, so it's sort of "stuck." Anyhow, besides heavy taxation and collapse there is another possibility: the US may inflate our way out of this debt. It's worked for decades, and as long as their is a large population willing to pay for this, there is no reason for it to stop. GBTC works in this scenario. Also, it looks as though there is a minimum 3.5 years before the taxation scenario happens, and there are plenty of short-term gains between now and then.
Oh yeah, and if the US completely collapses, I don't know how effective Bitcoin is going to be. It's got a shot, but the world will be upended and EVERYTHING could be very different.

It sounds to me like we need to get some miners up and running here in the US if we fear letting China gain too much power. This, by the way, we can do without anyone stopping us. And before we cry out that their government is subsidizing this, I would first make sure that our government won't.

I am reading that there are two ways to take advantage of this situation. 1) A method that is very obvious, and that no one has done yet, and 2) a method that is easy to hide, and that there is not direct way to find it happening on the chain. However, if  I suspect we can find a pattern of miners that have greater returns than we would normally expect. 
With that said, I am sure that we all have an equal shot at using the same "bug" that Jihan is using. I am concerned with a "fast attack" in which they have such an advantage that they could quickly take over the chain without us having a chance to respond. However, if it is just a matter of one person building a miner that can take advantage of the bug while others do not, then I say it is up to the others to follow suit, making the entire mining system stronger. A short term loss of profitability is not something to be worried about when greater things are at stake.

Do you have kids? Have you ever had to come up with a quarter or two in the spot? Young kids (and some adults) do better when payments cone daily or more frequently. Per job, for example. I've been caught without the correct change numerous times, and my kids don't accept plastic. But, with a paper wallet, payments, no matter how great or small, are minutes away with Bitcoin. I put copies of all of their public keys on one sheet on the fridge, right next to the chore chart with frequency and amount each chore is worth. They are content earning BTC measured in quarters and enjoy following the exchange rate up and down.

My point simply that there has been a tremendous amount of Mark bashing on this sub and as far as I can tell, he has not been convicted of a crime. For this reason, I say the scam goes over his head, even if he is involved. He would have to be protected as there would be too much evidence as to the whereabouts of the US Dollars that he supposedly took. All of the dollars were sent to Mizuho, so they have a record of all inflows and outflows. I'm sure he didn't pull paper Dollars out of the bank.

The MtGox loss was good in many ways, I've learned a lot chasing the loss down.
Let me jump back to the very beginning of our conversation.
Let's recall the bank bailout of 2008: 
This would not have happened with Bitcoin. Anyone giving a bad loan would have to take responsibility. Everyone involved in such a system would have to take responsibility.
But not with the USD. Responsibility was tossed out the door and with it the learning lesson that would have happened. Instead, we are back on track for a bigger drop that will catch even more people.
Both USD and BTC are effective tools for trade, but people worldwide are learning the BTC is much more trustworthy, because you can't back out of a deal.
Let's look at another example. Let's say China, Russia, Europe and the US have a four way deal, swapping of debts, bonds, etc. The deal is based on the premise that debts will be repaid. Keep in mind that these debts buy real resources, like food. And all of these debt levels are so high that all payments must be made or the whole thing for all political establishments comes crumbling down.
Then, for some reason, maybe subprime mortgages going bad, one of the countries is unable to meet it's debt obligations. So, they renege. There might even be a "he said, she said" scenario where there is dispute in the interpretation of some contract. How do you resolve this? When food and the safety and livelihood of your people is involved? 
This is where I suggest that Bitcoin can force responsibility. 
Oh, and what I really mean is that people, organizations, political entities are forced to take responsibility when Bitcoin is involved, because Bitcoin is an unbreakable protocol. (Or at least has proven to be so far.) I added this last paragraph because I realized that I was giving Bitcoin an active persona, when it actually doesn't do anything but exist.

Kraken doesn't play politics with your money. Look into how they handled the last Bitcoin fork as well as the Ethereum fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:50:13
In Satoshi's world, miners are nodes. The longest chain, that with the most blocks, is Bitcoin. 


events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.   As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain  and  outpace attackers.   The
network itself requires minimal structure.   Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis,   and   nodes   can   leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
However, I do think it is safe to say that the longest chain may not necessarily be the strongest, but the one with the most proof of work. I also think that Satoshi would probably call both of the forks, Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin. Especially since he is presumably sitting on a bunch of Bitcoin for both chains.

No. But Bitcoin held on Kraken is worth more then Bitcoin held on Coinbase. 1 Bitcoin held on Kraken between July 31 and Aug 1 resulted in a split, whereby you get both Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash, each having a market value, and each easily moved and transported under your own control. 1 Bitcoin held on Coinbase between the exact same dates resulted in you only being able to control the Bitcoin Segwit, and it is still to be determined if the Bitcoin Cash will ever get to the users. They have not been given any choice in the matter. This may be for better or worse. I don't know. But what I do know is that this is the second time that Coinbase has done this. The first was when Ethereum split. Kraken does not play politics, and I salute them for this. Just look at the actual history history. Judge not by what they say, but what they do.

Bitcoin is what Satoshi created. All these chains are derivatives of his great idea. Both Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash are nice and serve their purpose. If the market needs a Bitcoin Seg2x, so be it. Name them all as such, unless Satoshi retruns from the grave to identify his/her child.

@_date: 2017-09-05 07:24:30


Oh, I felt responsible. It's my country, my neighbors. I am certainly partly to blame.


In a fractional-reserve situation (see previous link), force is self-imposed when bad loans go bad. The person or entity giving the bad loan goes out of business. But that is not what happened. Instead, more money was created and given to the banks that made bad loans. That philosophy trickled down to the consumer level. From loan modifications to evicted home owners being asked to reoccupy their home for free just to maintain an appearance of solvency. General rule of law was bent, changed, and tossed. And this only helped those that borrowed too much. Imagine the windfall that would have taken place for people that could not afford a house up to that point because borrowers were driving up prices.


Sometimes legal action just breaks down, as stated above. When politics and law fail, generally war ensues. See Venezuela as an example. Rules are being bent, and now people are protesting on the streets. I don't know that Bitcoin will fix this, as people may always feel unfair treatment, but it is a step in the right direction. If you loan out your Bitcoin, and it ends up being a bad loan, you lost it. End of story. You take responsibility for your own judgement.


Aha! As I go through this piece by piece, this is where our minds meet. You are absolutely correct. Bitcoin doesn't hold the borrower responsible. That is the lenders' job. Bitcoin holds the lender responsible for the lender's judgement. :-) This is where we may have the disconnect. I am suggesting that banks be held responsible for their judgements. Even central banks. When central banks and governments are not held responsible, the people that were of the wiser judgement (borrowing less) are the ones getting hurt.


Again, if the debt fails, as it did in 2008, even the US government could not collect. There was simply not enough capital generated to pay off the debt. Since banks could not collect, and the government could not collect, the Federal Reserve printed more money and made it all go away. But this was at the expense of the person that chose to take the risk of holding $100k in the bank, which was diluted as quickly as the money base expanded.
By the way, what happens when a German bank decides to not pay a US bank? Or an African bank chooses not to pay a Chinese bank? Or an Argentinian government decides to not pay a US investment bank? These are the bigger issues that Bitcoin can help to solve.


I am very skeptical if debt will even work in this new economy that we are forging. I am even more skeptical of debt repaid with interest.

I am enjoying the topic because we are tapping into an area where a very small nuance could be creating a different suggested approach (governance) while we are very close to agreement to the root cause.
Let's dig deeper.
1) I don't know why Bitcoin was created, as I am not in the mind of Satoshi. However, I have imagined a scenario where Satoshi is a team of very smart people that put this technology into motion for exactly the purpose of undoing the situation that fractional reserve banking has put us into. Again, a possible scenario...I don't know.
Closer to the root: 
You don't trust individuals to take responsibility. That is what Bitcoin does, is it does force individuals to take responsibility. They may not act responsible, but they will be responsible, whether they like it or not.
Let's use your MtGox scenario. (I know this one well.) The level of personal damage (responsibility) was impacted is strongly correlated to the proximity of the damage.
1) Owners of MtGox - most severely hurt
2) Depositors - next in line
3) Vendors - only to the degree in which they we supplying
4) Bitcoin users
5) Cryptocurrency users
6) Japanese public
And so forth...
As I suffered from MtGox' "irresponsibility", you and other Bitcoiners suffered from my "irresponsibility", which other cryptocurrency users, the Japanese public, and maybe event your family suffered from. You get the idea. We all need to take responsibility for the risks we took.
The bank bailout hurt everyone using the US Dollar or relying on it in some way. We took that risk and therefore, are stuck with that responsibility. The tribes in Amazon were generally not effected.
Bringing it back to Bitcoin. We now have a choice of whether we participate in bailouts or not.

This won't happen with Bitcoin. How is a bank going to loan Bitcoin if it doesn't have Bitcoin in the first place. If someone injects Bitcoin into a bank, and then the bank makes a bad loan that doesn't get repaid, that someone is "forced" to take responsibility by losing the Bitcoin that was injected into the bank in the first place.


How do you pay a Bitcoin loan back when the value keeps rising against all other things? I know that there will be many successful short term loans, but in the long wrong I am skeptical.
Would you loan or borrow Bitcoin against your house?

@_date: 2017-09-29 06:23:08
I didn't have a timeline for Segwit. It sounded interesting, but I did not carry the technical determination that it had to happen at all. I used to think that we can't just keep making blocks bigger. But I also felt when push came to shove that it was too early to limit the blocksize, especially a couple years ago when we started bumping up against the limit. That really slowed my personal ability to share Bitcoin with more people. I introduced Bitcoin and the difference between it and the fiat system to a lot of people; many of which are very happy for the education they've received. It became more difficult to train people when the cost to send from my phone to theirs and back, etc... And I have the advantage of working with larger amounts that people in third world countries do not. 
Doesn't matter now, we forked and people have options. We might get another fork, not sure...more options?

Why don't people start building miners? So many people here, many developers in particular, fear miners. They really are an important part of the ecosystem and are probably taking the largest risks. If being a miner is so easy, then why not start your own?
I simply do not understand the fear of miners. Same is said for developers. If you don't like the software developers are making, create your own. So much of the disagreement on these boards is simply people being lazy and relying on others. I am sure I've been guilty of it as well.

I never suggested taking away spending, although you could. Some people like to earn currency, some like to hold currency, some like to trade currency... 
A key point here is the HOLD. Holding currency allows you to AVOID spending right away. Because you may not want to buy milk that you won't use for a few months right now. You will want to buy it in a few months. This is a time value of money. Holding it doesn't mean its no longer currency. It just means your not spending it. So yeah, if you take away the spending, it's still currency. 
I would agree that there are a lot of people that like to spend currency without earning it or holding on to it.

We all have to rely on trust still. Were you in that room when CW allegedly proved his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto? Even if you were, do you know that everything you saw was real? 
Most likely you are answering "no" to just the first question. So, you have to trust a lot more people than Gavin did. The funny thing is that you have to trust the story of what happened from Gavin, Craig, or one of the other people in that room, or some other 3rd or 4th or 5th ... source to even have an idea of what MIGHT have happened.

Actually, each individual and company gets to decide on what is Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Segwit, BTC, BCH and so forth. Each individual can think and speak freely. They are only words.
The reality is that there was one Bitcoin, and then it forked on August 1. One fork became what I call Bitcoin Cash. The other fork became what I call Bitcoin Segwit. Bitcoin Cash has a bigger blocksize and allows more transactions on-chain. Bitcoin Segwit has allows more transactions offchain. Both are great technology and serve different purposes.

My original question is a legitimate question. Watch what happens to GBTC. They've already made an announcement regarding Bitcoin Cash: 
I did draw attention to the fact that this thread was downvoted. For the rest of you reading this thread, look at my history. You will see that I sat without opinion on the blocksize for the longest time. Technically, I think both are great and serve different purposes. I agreed with LukeJr.'s smaller block idea. But I have been silenced on this subreddit far more than the others. Look at the question I am asking here, and ask yourself, is this an important question or not? 
Also, be very careful of anyone that claims that there is only ONE cryptocurrency. Total BS! This comes from someone who is all in on Bitcoin because I believe in it; but it can be just as corrupt as any other monetary system.

Sounds like you have a lot of learning to do. There are risks with paper wallets that I don't go into now. Just experiment with small amounts to begin with, and it will start to make sense. For example, download a new Bitcoin wallet, add a small amount of funds ($5 or $10), print out a paper wallet. Send $1 to the paper wallet. Look up the address on blockchain.info or some other block explorer. You can see the funds on the paper. Use the paper wallet as a bookmark in you book next time you fly from one country to another (or imagine doing so). Make a copy of the paper wallet. Burn one. Send another $1 to the remaining paper wallet. Look it up on Blockchain.info. Then "sweep" the paper wallet with the phone wallet. It is a pretty exhilarating feeling.
You may want to do this with Bitcoin Cash, rather than Bitcoin Segwit. It is easy to do and you can explore using this:

I am aware of the CW situation. Not well aware, but enough for me for now. Also, the debate between you and CW that you linked to, he seems to do a great job proving his points. This, however, doesn't mean that both of your are not collectively deceiving the public, and possibly targeting me specifically. I don't know, and my judgement are all based on assumptions. 
Right now, my gut tells me that CW is part of SN and trying to defend the original vision, of which BS is likely trying to contain. With that said, BS may feel that it is important to contain Bitcoin, because the worldwide repercussions are staggering. Some are afraid of that change, others are not. Most probably cannot fathom what it means, and the fine line of great risk that we balance upon today.

Does it matter whether it is "Bitcoin" or not? Bitcoin Cash has value. People are buying it now. See here:
I agree that there must be some threshold must be defined so that business is not stuck preparing for every little fork. That was the second question. But in this case, there is substantial value there according to the market. You may disagree with the market, but I don't think you are suggesting that this particular free market should be suppressed are you?

It's completely fair because no one is forcing anything on anyone. Otherwise I would complain that the developers and miners are forcing me to use a cryptocurrency that is different than the one I initially purchased because they forced the hash rates up and changed the code. The reality is that nobody needs to be forced to do anything in this game, we each just get to pick and choose what we do, but can't force our desires on each other.

Thank you for the well-thought reply. 


I don't know what the law will say, but it will come up at some point. What if it was a perfect 50/50 split on value, hash rate, usage, etc...? What then? Who decides? But I also think we could hurt companies trying to do business if they are forced to re-gear for a 1% fork, or something small like that. There needs to be some sort of threshold level to determine if alternative forks need to be supported. Or, it should state in user agreements / prospectuses how minority forks are handled. Maybe they have that in place already.
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:32:25


agreed - Both Cash and Segwit chains serve their purpose perfectly. Let's let the children of Bitcoin rock and roll!
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:25:18
So let's all do Segwit2x. This that will happen? 
It is up to each individual and each company to decide. It is really unfortunate that we don't have ONE Bitcoin, but the fact remains that there are extreme views out there, so Bitcoin has been divided, and may be divided yet again. Fiat central banks love this. 
Swgwit2X was a compromise to move Bitcoin advocates together, forward in lock-step, to prevent this ideological breakup. However, we have a bunch of tech people that see things in black and white, and missed the bigger picture. So, we are now going to be fighting many more battles on many more fronts. 
What is important, is the the collective basket of cryptocurrencies is still superior to the collective basket of fiat.

@_date: 2017-09-03 20:16:03
I think we are mostly in agreement. Where we might differ is that you see people putting money into an institution and trying to make a profit as a problem. I don't see a problem with that, so long as we are not forced to bail them out. 


Bailouts are not needed. Period. We made the mistake of thinking that a bailout was absolutely necessary when the "banks were too big to fail." This was not true, but the general public believed it, the banks were bailed out, and those that were are now bigger. 
You can't fix everything for everyone. In my opinion, it is far better to have a multitude of small failures rather than one big one.

The MtGox incident shows that Bitcoin transactions can be private. One of the largest thefts in history, and no one has been caught.

You can see my history to get an idea of the minimum. I did not mean to sound or be aggressive with my question. I was genuinely trying to understand your thoughts, and within your context.


What is that philosophy? Peer to Peer money? We will have it and in many more forms today than could have ever been conceived eight years ago.


Are you sure that you are not injecting your desires on others? It seems to me the people running the businesses you don't like might want this and say that their way is how it is **supposed** to be done. Let's be careful and call these personal desires out, even if they are our own.

I used MtGox and left my Bitcoin in MtGox; so part of that missing 650k Bitcoin is mine. You said that MtGox's failure brought the whole industry down, and you are right, in a way. I mean, people didn't have to sell if they didn't want to, but they did. You might say it was even more their fault for the value of Bitcoin coming down (since MtGox didn't directly impact them, but the act of selling did.) Butterfly Effect. We are all connected and each of our actions impacts the other to varying degrees. Was I more responsible than Mark Karpeles? No. Was Mark Karpeles more responsible than the thief? No. (This is assuming that he wasn't the thief.) But I was responsible in my own small way. And in my own small way, I've paid the price. But I am not paying as much as the thief should they ever be discovered.
Let's look at the act of holding (can we say using?) Bitcoin. If it suddenly fails for some unforeseen reason, shouldn't we be at least partially responsible for our own loss? 
And you shouldn't force me to take responsibility for your loss, unless I somehow caused it. Everyone is responsible, somewhere between 0% and 100% responsible.

Well they're very easy to set up. How do we know that all the nodes that are already set up are not a more advanced sybil attack? This is the challenge with non-mining nodes running the network. It just doesn't make sense. Satoshi and the white paper were very good at predicting the importance of miners. He/she/they knew that miners would greedily prevent each other from trying to destroy that Blockchain. They are the castle walls which will prevent outsiders from doing harm. They are very expensive to maintain, and very expensive to replicate. Only parties thay are vastly interested would try to build or tear down these types of walls. Good luck.

Yes. You're probably better off trying this with Bitcoin Cash. There are lots of places that you can exchange your Bitcoin Segwit for Bitcoin Cash. They are both from the exact same source code. Bitcoin Cash functions much more like the original Bitcoin. There are many exchanges where you can send $20 in Bitcoin Segwit, and get roughly 10 to 1 right now.
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:12:58
Is litecoin a fork from Bitcoin? No. That is why. 
Both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Segwit are derivatives from Bitcoin. And the name is very very important in this game. He who owns the name, owns the space in the minds of millions if not billions of people worldwide.

Learn how to tranfer Bitcoin from one wallet to another. Take a small amount of Bitcoin and practice doing this. For example, from a phone to a computer and to a paoer wallet. Send back and forth a few times to get familiar eith the process.
Definitely learn how to hold Bitcoin in your own wallet, because Coinbase does control your ability to spend or trade the Bitcoin at the moment. Further, when there are forks, they have a history of not giving you full control of both forks immediately.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:13:02
The only thing that would "randomly half" your value would be if the market decides that the Bitcoin that you own is worth half as much. When Bitcoin forks, AND YOU HOLD THE PRIVATE KEYS, you have access to use the value on both chains. The fork means the database of public and private addresses is copied. So, if you have the private keys before the fork, you now have the private keys for both forks.
You really should experiment by transferring Bitcoin from one address to the other a few times. Making some wallets, etc... It will be one of the cheapest, most valuable lessons you get in life.

Agreed, I injected "end" and should not have. 
My real question thought is trying to understand your goal of creating a better world. You write of "unimaginative businessmen" and Salt Lending as if they are bad things, enslaving humanity. Also that Bitcoin was built to remove people and countries out of debt. I used to think that Bitcoin would eliminate debt, but I do not believe that anymore. I do think it enforces responsibility for debts that people and institutions permit. Further, forgiveness can still happen, but it will be much more clear when it is happening and the parties (the forgiven and the forgiver) involved.

Well, you got part of it right. Correct start would have been, "A few businesses trying to keep Bitcoin from forking." The whole purpose of the agreement was compromise on a scaling disagreement. Hardliners on either side disagreed. An over simplification could be stated as, "software developers versus miners." Although, there were developers that wanted "big blocks" and miners that wanted "small blocks." 
For u/TheLocalGoat:
The result of the first fork was Bitcoin Cash (aka, BCash or BCH) and Bitcoin Segwit. Bitcoin Segwit may now result in Bitcoin Segit Only and Bitcoin Segwit 2x.
Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto and is the mother of all these coins. Right now Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Segwit both have a great purpose. I am unsure about the resulting coins of the upcoming fork, but they will both likely similar to Segwit, the 2x will have the nice advantage of giving people the ability to do smaller transactions with lower fees. This will naturally increase the market reach.

From the white paper:


events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.   As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain  and  outpace attackers.   The
network itself requires minimal structure.   Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis,   and   nodes   can   leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
While he describes the longest chain of blocks, I think it can also be argued that Bitcoin has most proof of work. However, the reality is that both Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Segwit are Bitcoin. Much like Linux has different kernels, but they are all still Linux. However, where Linux can be changed and it's entire history wiped, Bitcoin has a history that can be wiped, but probably will not be in the case of a fork as the "forkers" want to continue to history because it has value. Thus, the roots of any Bitcoin Fork give it genetic proof that it is a version of Bitcoin. People then decide if the wish to use it or not.

Bitcoin was spendable at every place that accepts VISA/Mastercard, which is pretty much everywhere. I don't know if that is still the case because transaction fees have gone up. However, Segwit and Bitcoin Cash both seem to be showing promise, so maybe low fees will be the norm again. Bottom line is that the old fiat systems will need to adapt or die. Most likely they will be going away because they are politically driven.

You're asking the wrong question. Banks don't do anything. Individuals do. Individuals conceive banks, set up banks, put trust in banks, and ultimately, deposit and withdraw from banks. They might even let banks lend money. So, what I suggest is that we shorten the question a bit.
Who ~~holds the bank of bitcoin~~ is responsible?
The answer, of course, is individuals. Us. We. You and I. This is where so much of our society is going wrong today. We don't want to take responsibility, only the benefits of it. Bitcoin forces individuals and collectives to take responsibility.

Several years ago it was possible to connect your bank account to Coinbase, and get a Shift card tied to it. I believe with this combination it was possible to make a purchase with your Shift card, which would generate an automatic sale of the Bitcoin amount, and if set up properly, probably the purchase of the Bitcoin at the same time. Not sure, as I only used one to make USD purchases using the card. Fees made it a bit discouraging.

The theory is that AV may have stolen a bunch of missing MtGox Bitcoin, and at the very least laundered much of the missing funds.
There are many victims in this event, and if true, I am one of the first that would like to know. But I want this to happen in an open court, preferably live-streamed via Internet. There is no need to ship AV to the US or Russia. Keep him in Europe and live stream the case. And for the love of Bitcoin, give us the last known MtGox Bitcoin addresses! Make it public. The victims overwhelmingly want this, and arguments of privacy are a joke when the addresses are pseudo-anonymous and the customer database was leaked anyhow.

A: If a User cannot remember his or her username or e-mail address and password, it will be
necessary to file an Exchange-Related Bankruptcy Claim using the Offline Method. when logging in
for the first time, however, an e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address which was originally
registered with the MTGOX Bitcoin exchange to inform the User of a temporary authentication code
that will be necessary to set a new password for logging in to the System, and therefore, it is
necessary that the User is able to receive the e-mail.

Great idea. Take it a step further by adding the estimated TRAFFIC for the news source/page. There are public databases for this available. You might also consider overlay of that traffic. For example an r/Bitcoin news bit would not be worth as much as a Forbes.com, which would not be worth as much as PEOPLEmagazine.com (or what ever it is), as each of these will bring a different level of people to the fold. Thinking about it, bearish news on r/Bitcoin would have more impact than bearish news on peoplemag.com. It's very complex, but definitely add weight based on estimated traffic/visitors.

There is sometime a spread between the buy and sell side. I hope that is what this was, though it sounds steep.

"they are just risk takers......you don't insult them when they go all in and you don't get on your knees to blow them if they succeed"
Absolutely correct. I don't know that risk takers are necessarily in it for money and status, though.  And I am not saying that they are truly here to "make the world a better place." I suspect each individual has their own reasons for doing what they do.
And whether advancement is "good" or "bad" is subjective as well. We could very well be better off living in caves and eating raw meat. Ignorance is bliss. Quite frankly technology excites me at times, and at other times I feel like it is just an endless cycle.

Cryptocurrency was discussed in congress in it's first 4 years of existence. There is a reason for that.
To answer your question, yes, I do understand the difference between the BTC cap and the US economy. Now here's one for you. Do you realize that the value of both Dollars and Bitcoin have no real value to the economy other than enabling us to trade, store value and communicate to each other relative values? Here is another one. Do you realize how archaic the current fiat systems are compared to Bitcoin? 
But that is not the point. The point is that both Dollars and Bitcoin are simply measurement systems, and a lot of FUTURE Dollars have been promised to people that are impossible to actually deliver on unless we inflate our way out of it. However, if we inflate our way out, it hurts the US internationally. If the US and US citizens hold a large portion of Bitcoin AND Bitcoin becomes the international currency, then we don't have to worry about losing our purchasing power.

You've made quite a few assumptions and false statements to "prove" me wrong. Statements like, "that's laughable at best", "armchair economists", and "You obviously have absolutely no idea" are tactics that do not address the discussion, but rather make personal attacks to make your own argument seem stronger. I am open to learning where my thinking is wrong, but you have not made any convincing points.
You also talk about "a couple percentages a year worth of inflation" as if that is what we are doing. I suspect most people would not define the amount of money created in the last 10 years as "a couple percentages." In 2008 we had 900 Billion dollars in M0, and today, less than 10 years later, we are just under 4 Trillion. That's something like 34% per year, which to me is a little more than "a couple percentage points", but who's counting? 
Here are a couple references for you: 
While my understanding of macroeconomics may not fit your textbook examples, it doesn't matter because we are off the subject matter. You originally asked how Bitcoin solves the serious debt problem. The answer is that it shifts the measuring tool from fiat to crytocurrency. Only people that understand the impact of this will adjust their portfolios accordingly while the others will just feel the pain and not truly understand why. This is less obvious than continuing down a path like Venezuela where inflation did not work and the people fighting each other.

Market cap is a real metric. It is a real metric of how much value is being transferred to a certain asset. It is not the only metric, and certainly has no bearing on how good or poor the technology or underlying philosophy is. Or what it's use case is.

I agree, to a degree. In the sense that you're probably using the term force. 
Our lives are intertwined between self direction and outside force. Nothing exists in a vacuum without outside forces. Let's pretend that you and ten other people decide not to pay any "tax", but decide to enter into "my" house, or cross "my" land. You can be sure that there will be conflict. To prevent these conflicts, "tax" can be a pretty good solution. You want to enter "my" house, here's the "tax" you will have to pay. It's a method to determine what is far, and could work great through collective free market choices and actions. Unfortunately, this is often not the case.
The alternative is use of force and ultimately war, which is how many conflicts have been resolved in the past. This is because we just haven't nailed down a perfect tax where everyone feels happy about it, yet.

We have spent Bitcoin with merchants, paid suppliers in Bitcoin, accepted Bitcoin as payment for goods and services. We recommend one wallet over another. We tell our friends when we think someone is trying to subvert the vision or not.

That is 1 theory. Silk Road was the largest marketplace using Bitcoin and MtGox was the largest place to convert BTC to fiat. People claim VJ have a bunch of BTC, MtGox is missing a bunch of BTC. VJ may be Plural of Mongoose, aka Tomas Clark, who tried to turn himself in to US prosecutors, but was not arrested back then. He draws attention to his story on mpg.com claiming fear for his life. Eventually he is arrested by Thai police, sits in Thai jail for 6-12 months (time is flying), claims to have a piece of paper with words on it that he threatens to deliver to Thai intelligence, and may now finally be extradited to the US for court. Coincidental timing, maybe. Again, just one theory.

Why? Why would these two steal the MtGox coins? I am not saying I disagree, but my gut tells me that this is likely untrue. If it is true, then I think there could be good reasoning for it, but I don't think it would be self-serving. You are in r/Bitcoin presumably because you think Bitcoin is a great technology that can fulfill its promises. If not, why would you spend your time here? I think the same is true for Ver, and probably Karpeles.  So why would they hurt the very technology that 1) made them rich beyond normal dreams, 2) put them in very influential places and 3) secured their future? It makes no sense to crush the dreams of all of your followers JUST when things were getting hot. Remember, that less than 6 months before the MtGox peak of $1200, the exchange was sitting around $100/btc. So what ever they had in terms of purchasing power was multiplied 10 fold.
What would the motivation be to steal 650k Bitcoin and crush the single largest exchange that enables Bitcoin's purchasing power?

I believe that you are quite wrong on this point. What does the Fed do? They make money. Money was a horrible store of value until Bitcoin came along. USD, however, will still be very very useful to exchange and move value around because the cost of doing so is so cheap.  That is precisely what gives it value. It is nothing more than a tool to measure value. Nothing more. USD happens to be one of the best tools for this simply because that is what people believe in. However, as they learn that Bitcoin can do the same, AND not be manipulated, they will gravitate to Bitcoin. If they can't use Bitcoin like they can dollars, then they just can't use Bitcoin and that is less value that is being stored within the system. 
The entire reason this event is so catchy, is because we are talking about money - the measuring stick - NOT GOLD.

Are you sure they did not try to steal? Remember, this was back when Bitcoin was still nascent technology and many people were fearful for just using it. Any MSM news from back then implied Bitcoin was pure evil. The two claimed to not be working together, yet, there are ties between the two and there are indications that another agent was involved. With that said, as we all know money is politics and it is possible that some early calls to destroy Bitcoin were made by an authority high enough that they are essentially untouchable without political upheaval. Mistakes happen, and some patsies go down to appease the public. 
Or maybe we just have two agents, that for some reason, both separately and individually thought that they could steal from Silk Road and try to penetrate MtGox for reasons unknown.

I think the overall point is that for funds stuck in the stock market, the exchange rate for one BTC is $4200.

Small transactions require a different kind of security. To keep a coffee transaction "secure" you don't need to build an establishment like this: 


I think we do care about credit card security. It's just that in some ways, they are not as secure as Bitcoin. I am not at all suggesting that we follow the same path. If we really wanted to, we could make every credit card transaction really secure, but the cost outweighs the benefit.

Paywall: strange, I am not seeing one at all. Anyone else? Regardless, you can probably find another source, and I'd be happy to use it. This was only a quick search and I am not even sure how reliable it is, but the number sounds reasonable.
Regarding small merchants converting BTC to fiat, I wonder what that percentage is, and if any of them even keep a small bit. Think BitPay or Coinbase will share that data? They are really in a great position to know. This info is probably more valuable than the companies themselves.
Anyhow, if small business owners have no desire to hold BTC, that certainly speaks to who the market potential. At least in the short term.

Scaling will help it replace money, but as far as long-term storage/gold replacement, I think it is superior in some ways, weaker in others (catastrophic infrastructure collapse). It is already very decentralized because there is nothing preventing others from running a miner other than their mental capacity to accomplish this. Anyone is free to run a miner. There are nation states and laws that have temporary influence on Bitcoin's direction, but in the long-term those false economic impacts will fail.

I am pretty sure both chains will be pretty killer. Each will have it's strengths and excel in their own directions.

Not necessarily. Everyone could be buyers at the same time. I never said everyone is NOT buying. But without getting into ratios of buying to selling, etc... Unless you wish to. Otherwise, here is adjusted thought:
What would happen if EVERYONE INVOLVED IN BTC RIGHT NOW borrowed fiat money to put it into Bitcoin, and then sold a little Bitcoin over time to pay off the fiat loan? 
This way, there is still a very very large market for buyers.
I guess the point is that borrowing fiat may be a very smart move, or not. It all depends upon how the markets play out. 
edit: We do know that the most powerful creators of fiat are also the biggest borrowers of the same. So, borrowers have that going for them.

BTC malleability losses only represented a couple thousand Bitcoin, not 650k Bitcoin. There is something more sinister here. Either Mark lost or stole them, or more likely, some kind of well organized effort somehow seized them. There were a couple US government agents, Force and Bridges, that were imprisoned for stealing Bitcoin from Silk Road, and at least one of them made attempts to "access" MtGox. Also, Chainanalysis, a company hired by the US Gov, claimed they know the MtGox Bitcoin destination.

Yes. Definitely differences here. However, MtGox assets (including name, customer list, etc..) could be purchased from bankruptcy. Then, in an attempt (and attempt only) try to make good with claimant customers in the same way Bitfinex did by offering "coins" that represent value for future recovered coins and/or free trades, a portion of distribution of profits, or some other measurement. It may be a big challenge to get those customers back, but maybe not... many are high-net worth individuals by now, and if BTC continues it's upward trends, that list will be very nice to serve.

Okay, catching up on the rest of this thread and I see you are referring to the MtGox case. Your theory is certainly one that I've considered. But I still think addresses can help prove/disprove your theory. Where are the MtGox addresses? Also, I believe there are earlier incidences where Bitcoin was stolen from Ver...and maybe he views it as "economic warfare" in which everything goes because he was a victim of the same. For example, US Gov steals his BTC, so he steals BTC from a bunch of US citizens.

I don't blame it on the Fed. I accept responsibility that this is happening in the first place. We (individually and as a society) have a choice of whether to have a single point of failure or not. Allowing the Fed to exist in the manner that it does allows a lot of power to be highly consolidated. This becomes political no matter what. 
I appreciate the sentiment for basic income, but I think that also creates artificial consumption that would not otherwise happens, which "steals" from those that don't use or need it. While it will have great short term effects, I think the long term result will be disastrous. I prefer to have many small individual wins and failures (life through evolution) than everybody wins followed by epic collapse of the whole (temporary exuberance).

I was referring to the claim that there was / is an improvement on Satoshi's vision. 
But since you're here, I've read a lot on both sides of the scaling debate, and both sides have good points for technical improvements. However, I do feel that Bitcoin Cash does more closely follow Satoshi's vision, whether a future failed idea or not. I am not at all opposed to a hard fork, to see how both sides evolve.  We can double the chances of success of this nascent tech that have two completely different purposes.

People should care, because if we can't find out why this sort of thing is happening and what is motivating people to do this, it will happen again and again. It will likely happen again anyhow, but we might be able to slow or stop the losses if we can find out why it is happening.

Malleability was less than 1% of the losses. While it was part of the problem, there were far greater issues at stake, of which you pointed out a few. Dwolla was a fiat loss, of which the US Gov returned half of the seizure back to MtGox. The Coinlab lawsuit is still pending, and according to Coinlab, accounts (names and addresses) were never handed over, and it's safe to assume the related Bitcoin wasn't either. A potential non-publicized loss is still what we are waiting to hear about. The last known addresses of the missing Bitcoin have yet to be revealed.

Agreed, IF people still want to hold on to fractional reserve fiat, gold, and inflated by law stocks, and real estate. I hope it does go slow, because nobody wants the result if this flips quickly. However, when you watch the likes of Venezuela, we know that this can happen rapidly anywhere. 
Most people are driven by emotion, not logic. Many of the genisis adopters here got in for logical reasons, not for emotional ones. The early adopters are starting to recognize the real possibilities and are just beginning to join the game. It will probably be a few more years before the mass emotional buyers flood the market. It might be slow, but it could also happen very quickly. It all depends on when the highly concentrated fiat 1% begin to let go of their perception of power and reach for this new one.

u/evoorhees has been in the space since the early days, and has done an incredible job offering users of crypto freedom of choice. He has consistently shown to prefer freedom of choice over the use of force. But you are correct that regardless of intent, users should be controlling their own coins. As you pointed out, this is one of the beauties of Bitcoin.
Users that have the capability should move their Bitcoin to their own wallets. If they do not, they should either learn how to or temporarily exit the space until the dust settles. 
Service providers that hold coins and are not prepared to support major forkcoin alternatives are not trust-worthy. I don't expect a provider to offer a forkcoin is Joe Schmo creates his own fork, and only he and his 10 buddies use it. But if there is a substantial fork (i.e. 10% or more), that is worth providing support. Service providers must turn over the private keys to their customers at the very least.

People selling = short term speculation that the price will drop further so they can buy more BTC later. There may be some newbies that are freaking out, but I see these rises and falls becoming much less dramatic as the history of come-backs lengthens. We could go to $1200, but there will be a shitload of fiat just waiting to get back in. People are becoming educated on crypto. I am starting to think we might see the final blow to fiat soon. I don't think fiat will go away, but we could see hyperinflation worldwide once people no longer really want it. See Venezuela for a reference point.

Roth IRA
A Roth IRA’s tax advantages differ from the Traditional IRA. If eligible for this account, your annual contribution limits are the same but are not tax deductible. However, since annual contributions have already been taxed, these contributions will never be taxed again and earnings can grow tax free. Finally, the contributed funds can be withdrawn any time you wish and there are no required minimum distributions after age 70½.
Withdrawals of your contributions to a Roth IRA are tax-free anytime. However, withdrawals of earnings are only free from federal income tax, provided they meet the following requirements:
    You are purchasing your first home ($10,000 lifetime maximum)
    The Roth IRA has been in existence for at least five years
    You are age 59½ or older
    You become disabled or have passed away
What You Should Know About Converting Costs
You can convert a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA at any time. You must note that when you convert to a Roth IRA, you must pay income tax on the otherwise taxable amount of the transfer. To maximize the benefits of conversion, the money to pay those taxes should come from a source outside the Traditional IRA you are converting. You may convert your Traditional IRA over several years to manage the tax consequences.
Account Minimums and Fees:
    There is no minimum initial deposit required to open an account
    There are no maintenance fees for retirement accounts
 
Commissions, service fees and exception fees still apply. See our commission and brokerage fees for details.

Let's think about this. If ALL of the coffee transactions in the world are added to Bitcoin, then what happens to Bitcoin's market cap?
Let's see, here's a source for value: 
Looks like Bitcoin's market cap would jump $14 Million - assuming zero profits are held in Bitcoin. But, if owners of coffee shops hold on to that Bitcoin instead of moving it to Dollars, then suddenly you add 5 Billion to the market cap every year. This is coffee alone.
I am not saying that this is necessarily a good thing, as I do fear a single money for all transactions, but you have to admit as a Bitcoin user, in the short term that looks damn attractive.
Coffee transactions can educate. Please don't underestimate the value of this. 
edit: I got the 14 million by dividing the 5.177 Billion by 365 days - with the assumption that 0% of the coffee shops hold their Bitcoin more than one day.

This is a great application/use of Bitcoin from what I see. There are already stock photo sites that require you to purchase tolkens, so it's not much of a stretch. It will be difficult to come in as a late entry, but if you can create an international network it may work. Include a forum for people to post "photo/video wanted."

This is true, but put anyone in that context. You purchase this tiny exchange thinking it will grow quickly, and it does. But much faster than you imagined. Within a couple years it looks like you could be running the world's economy shortly, but then the world's economy fights back. It was too much too fast and there must have been some very powerful forces bringing MtGox down. I wonder if anyone in that role could have averted such an attack. It would really take someone special. 
Love him or hate him, MtGox and Mark were key figures to bringing Bitcoin to where it is today.

I used to drive across the Mexican border regularly. On one of those trips I could tell the border agent was preoccupied by something other than what he was supposed to be checking with me when he asked the routine question, "Do you have any drugs, guns, money, food, alchohol, or cigarettes?" Knowing he wasn't paying attention, I lied, "Just a hundred pounds of marijuana." He didn't even flintch and continued to ask his other questions, completely missing my joke.
Months later I was again, with my family when I had the routine question. Feeling a little nice that day I decided to tell the border agent the truth an admitted having a single mango. Huge mistake. After the 60 seconds of pulling the mango out of the cooler we spent the next three hours watching a crew rip our entire van apart and leaving all of our belongings strewn about pavement.

Here is a good starting point: 
   A  purely   peer-to-peer   version   of   electronic   cash   would   allow   online
payments   to   be   sent   directly   from   one   party   to   another   without   going   through   a
financial institution.   Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
The   network   timestamps   transactions   by   hashing   them   into   an   ongoing   chain   of
hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
the proof-of-work.   The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.   As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network,  they'll  generate the  longest  chain  and  outpace attackers.   The
network itself requires minimal structure.   Messages are broadcast on a best effort
basis,   and   nodes   can   leave   and   rejoin   the   network   at   will,   accepting   the   longest
proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

The theft of that Bitcoin hurt people. There are still 650k Bitcoin missing from MtGox, and it is known that one of these agents attempted to "collaborate" with MtGox, probably trying to access the systems there. Supposedly these two agents were not working together, despite that they had previous contact and evidence showing that there was at least a third agent involved. Regardless, the Bitcoin that they stole hurt the people that owned the Bitcoin before it was stolen. But that's not the real damage. The real damage is the increasing lack of trust that the general public has for their government when corruption happens and the sentences are less forceful than they are for non-government people.

Um. If we get stuck in this situation where we cannot increase the number of transactions, then our only option is to increase the value of those transactions. Like fiat, Bitcoin will have no value if PEOPLE cannot use it. Billionaires can have all the Bitcoin in the world, but the rest of the population won't give two shits and will use an alternative coin all Bitcoin offers is a "store of value." I am all in on Bitcoin, but we need to build the economy. That means getting more people using it. If we create a system of vaults, but another alt creates a system of transactions, the systems of transactions will eventually contain more value.

Bitcoin will be around for a very long time, but it is very important to reinforce the idea that people should have the right to choose their own currency. Without this, too much influence will exist in a centralized way. It happens in every industry, including government. If people can just create and start using a new currency when the old one becomes to consolidated, it will reduce the abuse of money making/managing powers. We must make sure people have the right to choose their own currency.

I usually like reading the alternative views of Zerohedge, but I stopped reading at this:
"As the theory goes, the massive swings in bitcoin’s valuation witnessed back in 2013 were engineered by the PBOC when authorities prohibited local financial institutions from dealing in the digital currency. In early September of that year, one bitcoin was worth $100. By late November, the price had ballooned to $1,000. Then the price came crashing down seemingly overnight. Chinese authorities were widely blamed for the drop, which created what should’ve been an incredible buying opportunity."
The reason the market crashed was because there was one exchange, MtGox, that represented 80% of the market and a very large portion of the Bitcoin that the exchange held were lost. 650k Bitcoin is a rough number that supposedly went missing. The term Goxxed was created out of the situation. 
The Zerohedge article acknowledges this, but not until after making this weird claim that the market fell because China manipulated it.
Remember, markets might be manipulated, but you are your own person and can decide for yourself the value of Bitcoin. No one forces you to buy or sell.

As of now, there are only a handful of people that have access to the last known addresses, and those have not been released to the public despite many outcries for that to happen. I am convinced that this is an international dispute in which two different governments/societies see this situation differently. There were a number of big "hits" on Bitcoin that all seem related. I have done a couple write ups on this:

Great advice. I'd like to add one more:
Split your 'spending money' into two pots: half fiat, half BTC. When BTC is 'up', spend BTC. When BTC is 'down' spend fiat. This supports the BTC economy, increases transactions, and stabilizes the market. Of course, we need scaling to help make this happen.

Government should not be though of in terms of borders, landspace, or politics. Rather, Government should be developed and maintained as voluntary propositions.
