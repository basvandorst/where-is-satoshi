Agreed. And I believe it’s healthy to shake off those buyers and weak hands. I do my own research before any action, and when my indicators suggest it’s over-brought, I will not buy even if it looks juicy(man it’s sugh a torture sometimes��). As a true believer and coder studies blockchain, I believe crypto just got started. Let market decide short term and faith decide long term. 
In addition, “bubble” isn’t purely a bad thing. Bubble makes people/institutions be aware of this baby technology. Other new technologies take so much to pitch for funding and attention. Crypto gets them much easier nowadays. Good projects draws attention pretty much immediately. This is the best era, and be greedy in a rational way.

When in panic, ask yourself: 
1. Can I live without the money in a long term? If not, lower your risk and just sell. Otherwise 
2. Did anything critical happen to bitcoin itself? Any fundamental bug found? Design/white paper changed and disappointed you big time? If not: 
3. What does Korea or Chinese news mean to crypto market? Guys, crypto raises because we are fed up with centralized government censorship. This is exactly what we know will happen. 
4. With this tremendous market and booming technology, how could governments kill it easily? Is bitcoin going to 0? Again, what doesn’t kill it, makes it even stronger.

Now that ppl know South Korea news is fud, how come the price is still dropping? Who are selling? Confused. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:05:45
If leave out the technology roadmap, and just focus on the price chart for now: a solid close on 100 days daily chart is healthy, I would say close on 200 days is even healthier but people may get too scared... I hope people can zoom out and look at the history. If price takes off with volume from 200 days I’d consider it as a super strong buy signal. Chill and watch it fall, there’s still room.

If targeting short term (day trading) you should not be trading bitcoin at all. If you can hold longer, 16500 is a pretty good price. When panicking, just zoom out.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:38:07
Curious how many btc are sold last 24hrs
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:41:05
Survived China ban, bcash pump and dump, now looking at this - just cant believe it all happened in months. What a year. Happy holidays hodlers.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:36:07
It will test 12k again then renounce - broke 13500 once, which was the major support of last renounce, meaning it has to re-test 12k or 11.5k. Just wait and buy the dip. Merry Xmas~ (all bitstamp prices)
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:08:21
The dip has stopped. It will be narrow bouncing between 13k to 15k, for a relatively long term. Weeks, months. Let it rest and digest, save up energy for the next round. After all it has been a crazy month due to news on futures. Be patient, and enjoy the holidays.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:56:46
Eth is slow too... a kitty game completely jammed it. It has a long way to go. Don’t know much about xrp so no comment.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:33:11
The dip is over. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:30:56
Bitcoin will need couple days to digest and adjust. Don’t expect a take off too soon.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:58:12
Well let the market decide then. If it worths it, we will see. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:10:29
Keep calm and buy the dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:51:39
I do agree the slow transaction and high fees are problems. I also remember how I hated slow internet speed which made online video streaming/gaming/file transfer jokes. But if you believe in the concept, if there’s enough attention and profit motivation, good things eventually become the future. Stay positive and be patient. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:01:51
I think what’s being created is determined by the market, not the people making forks. The fork creature may become trash or precious metal. This may not be a appropriate comparison: I guess we may consider both coal and diamond as forks of Carbon? they are different in value due to attribute/amount/demand/purpose people has. They don’t undermine each other’s value or carbon as an element’s value. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:26:32
Missed 11k, was driving to work.... will we see it again? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:17:11
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:46:07
1. It broke 13500 twice, but the second time is much better supported and didn’t retest 12000. (Bitstamp price)
2. Tether drops back to 1.0ish. Meaning people holding fiat(tether equivalent) that were watching the market started to jump in.
3. 4hr well supported by 200 days. Bounced twice.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:04:05
Didnt panic sell any. Brought at 15k 13k and 12k. Missed 11k. �� proud of myself. Go bitcoin, what doesn’t kill it makes it stronger~
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:24:30
I see, thanks! And this will happen in a day?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:33:32
Thanks a lot!

Whenever I ask myself this question, I think of gold. And comparing to gold, bitcoin is certainly a more stable and powerful format of “currency”. 
The total amount is capped, it’s easy to transfer, it’s certified and safe(according to block chain principle, everyone knows you own your bitcoins). 
If bitcoin is a bubble, gold is too. If the bubble of gold lasts centuries, bitcoin can do even better.
I honestly don’t think bitcoin can replace fiat or gold. Instead it will become another well received store of value - similar to rare metal, crude oil, etc. fiat or whatever currency may the be backed by bitcoin to some extend. People will continue to trade it as they trade for volume or future of gold.
Fiat will still exist. And become more trustworthy and healthy - it will to be backed by more elements - governments credibility, country growth, gold, and things like bitcoin.

Makes sense. Thanks!

What does this mean? Have seen similar pics, what’s the story?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:06:51
I didn’t get it... what does it mean
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:15:33
I suggest buy at each support level you believe. To me, I brought some at below 6500. Next will be below 6200
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:41:20
Why 3 hrs 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:31:12
What will happen at 7? Shitcash hard fork?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:22:14
Very calm. After all we are the people survived China ban and BCH dump. 
Just annoyed buy gdax. Watching a dip but can’t buy any? This is torture.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:53:48
I heard below 20k it is tax exempt. Is that true?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:22:01
How to read this chart?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:19:35
I consider the forks of bitcoin as other alternative “metal” rather than gold. Platinum or diamond may become less or more “valuable” than gold, but they are not gold. Forks of bitcoin are not clones. It’s not making bitcoin total amount multiplied.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:44:18
Too early to say. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:24:25
6000 is pretty much the cost of mining one bitcoin. If whales and miners still want this game, they better save the market now.

Korean’s price is back to exceeding. What does it mean?
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:38:06
Looking at btc trying to climb up after a fall, feel like a proud parent. Nooooo I got too attached
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:57:08
Sec mentioned HODL. Yee 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:44:46
My profile has been bleeding but I didn’t sell any. Not even thought about selling. 
Price doesn’t strike me anymore. All I want is show my tiny little support to this one thing that I believe. 
Only invest the money you can spare, this is the best principle I learnt. 
Bitcoin, please stand up just like you did every single time. May the force be with you.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:25:43
Remember, a bitcoin sold is a bitcoin brought.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:04:36
What’s up with Korean? How come their platforms start to get even lower prices? Anyone know?
