We were not aware of Satoshitango or Ripio. Bitex.la serves the market, but is based outside the country. Conectabitcoin is a peer-to-peer platform like local bitcoins. Thanks for the information.

Common misconception here - the US Class Action is proposing the settlement jointly with the Canadian and International class actions. If you're looking for restitution, I suggest you get in touch with them.

Ecuador is using the term "digital currency" without regard for its implied meaning as we understand it. This article is not correct.

paste the link into google and then click on it. good shortcut

The term 'digital currency' in regards to Ecuador's plans originates from an article that originally ran in the PanAm Post in which they talk about issuing a digital currency. I think at best right now it's unclear whether this term was being used specifically to refer to a block chain-based system, unless i've missed something totally, or more generally to a digital money, perhaps not based on a block chain. We'll have to do a follow-up to this on CoinDesk. I have not heard anything about it being block chain-based, as I have with Mexico's still-theoretical, but actively being discussed Digital Peso program.
