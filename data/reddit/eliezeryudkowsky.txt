I'm surprised and am tempted to bet against you on this.  I mean, presumably you know a *lot* more than I do, but this guy doesn't sound at all like he should be Satoshi.  What odds would you offer?

Donating to charity does not allow you to avoid taxes on any other gains.  All it does is let you donate the BTC you are giving away without paying taxes on capital gains on the BTC you are donating.  You don't make money that way.  If you have a $50,000 annual salary, donate 1000 BTC that year, and don't earn or sell anything else, you will pay the same amount in income tax as anyone else making $50,000.  If you sell another 50 BTC on the side and don't donate it to charity, you will owe the same capital gains as anyone on those 50 BTC, even though you donated 5000 BTC in the same year.
(Is this what people really believe?  That charity makes you net money because of tax breaks?  Jeez.)

Yes, correct nitpick.  The perils of transparency illusion.

Hi!  This is the Probability Theory Fairy!  When one hypothesis is disproven by evidence that doesn't otherwise distinguish between alternate hypotheses, the probability mass lost from the disproven hypothesis is evenly distributed over all the others!  Read up about Bayes's Theorem if you want to know more!
tl;dr if the coins weren't stolen that makes it more likely that the private keys were lost, that Mark stole the money, that the Feds seized the money, etc.

It sounds like you may not have understood tax law.  If I donate a Bitcoin and claim it has a fair price of $100,000,000, the tax deduction I could claim is exactly balanced out by a corresponding accounting gain of $100,000,000 that I 'realized' at the time of donating the Bitcoin.  It's not that the IRS can figure out the real value is $6,000, it's that it doesn't make an ultimate difference to my tax return what value I claim.

The part I don't get is how they intended to profit from the scam in the 90 minutes between when it came out and when it was discredited.  Like, am I being too Slytherin in even wondering if there was a plan here?
