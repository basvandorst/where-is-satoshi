I heard he wasn't even involved in bitcoin and he still got a free lunch!

You mean it doesn't fund the state because it isn't currently taxed, correct? If bitcoin replaces fiat, then a portion will certainly end up going to the government in some form of tax. We're a loongg way off from a governmentless society. 
I understand that its a deflationary currency rather than an inflationary currency. But how does that prevent an economic gap as suggested in the video? The rich will still be rich, and the poor will still be poor.
The points he made in the video seem to have no validity to them even though he presented them as "facts about bitcoin". I think he made more claims about his philosophical position,  than the realities of what a cryptocurrency bring to the table.

Entertaining talk but he doesn't clearly explain his position.
* Why isn't it possible for bitcoin to be taxed? Any company operating in a country will pay taxes on profits. Even with current fiat, its possible to avoid paying taxes if you wanted to. Bitcoin doesn't really change that. 
* Why isn't it possible for lobbyist groups to use bitcoin? I would counter-argue that its even MORE likely because of bitcoins somewhat anonymous properties.
* Why would bitcoin create a more equal economic climate? The rich will still be rich, and the poor will still be poor. 
* Why does paying with bitcoin create a more "free" marketplace. Does paying for my groceries in bitcoin rather than fiat really change anything? Not really. I recognize that if you no longer have a government like you suggest then yes that changes everything, but that same situation would be the same if you still had any currency but didn't have government. Why does using bitcoin itself make the marketplace free?

I agree. This has nothing to do with bitcoin.

Yeah... I was thinking the same thing.
