Thanks so much! 
@_date: 2016-08-18 08:08:44
Yeah, I've been buying bitcoin on my own for about 2 years now. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 07:55:08
We got our first bitcoin payment yesterday!

I'll try and run a report at the end of the month and report back.  
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:50:04
Ill look into it.  I tried to figure it out when they first launched and downloaded the files but kind of got lost in the process.

Thanks for the add!  i have three balls on my site. You have the Magic ball listed.  It top seller is the F Bomb ball and the odd ball pack which is all three balls for the price of two.  I'd be happy to offer anyone paying with bitcoin a discount on their order as well.  I love supporting this community. PM me and i'll drop you a promo code. If i get enough interest I'll post one for everyone.  Thanks again for the listing!

I'll check it out! Thanks again!!
@_date: 2016-08-18 19:22:58
Oh man, thanks a bunch! I'm honored.
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:09:41
They should have a link on their site for them..the F-bomb for sure. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 18:10:11
Not for kids but my kid loves them. It's just swears.
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:52:16
I spilled it in a comment above.  [swearball](
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:51:14
It's a product called swearball. It a a set of balls that swear when you throw them...so sort of adult but not "that" kind of adult. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:28:11
I plan to for sure.  Business has been great so far!
@_date: 2015-06-28 05:36:23
I have been doing this each paycheck too.  I do leave it in Coinbase but move it to the vault on that site.  Do you think that is safe enough? 
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:16:25
I see, Coinbase does have a mutisig vault option.  Seems complicated but I guess it's better to be safe.  Thanks for the advice.

I think he is composting actually.

I've been buying Bitcoin for awhile.  I think about my 401k and the cash I have in that. I wish there was a way to move that to bitcoin so i don't end up losing all its value in the next 10 years.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:56:57
Anyone have some thoughts on BTCJam?  
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:59:06
Anyone what to talk about how ascribe.io works? How content and ownership can be stored in the Blockchain?
@_date: 2015-07-28 01:13:01
My 401K is mostly in Midcap stocks.  What would be the best way forward for someone who has a fair amount of investment in a company 401k?  
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:52:21
This seems like huge missed opportunity.  most of us who have bitcoin want to see it implemented in as web payments standard.  Most of the excitement many here have is related to the wide spread adoption of bitcoin as a web payment standard that crosses lots of barriers to traditional payment systems.    
@_date: 2015-11-05 17:48:17
Great video thanks!
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:25:46
Awesome that you are supporting Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:02:10
well, I'm interested in how the blockchain can help manage, monetize and provide ownership proof.  I Continue to hear about all the benefits of the blockchain and how it will revolutionize ownership, content, micro-transactions and was wondering if anyone of you experts had a ideas of how blockchain can be used in conjunction with a large content archive.
