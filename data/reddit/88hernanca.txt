It would not destroy the network per se, but the value of bitcoin would plummet due to the lack of trust.

This is a concern I share with you. Every node (normal user?) must download the entire history of transactions. A day may come when blocks are generated at a pace that surpasses my internet connection speed, and from that point on I will always be out of sync no matter what.
Is this correct? I'm just a newbie.

Third party wallets will never be as secure as a software wallet running in your computer (if you follow the appropriate security guidelines). A web service can potentially lose the keys (cryptographic values that allow the access to your money) or even steal money from your wallet.
For small amounts and for day-to-day transactions is OK to store your BTC in web wallets, but if you plan to acquire a large amount you MUST use a [paper wallet]( or risk losing every last satoshi.

People from poor countries, like myself, find it completely impossible to buy bitcoins. Unfortunately, most exchanges require a bank account and transfers fees are prohibitively expensive. Volatility doesn't help, either.
My last resort to acquire BTC is through mining, but my GPU mines only about 0.01 BTC a day.

Unfortunately, is kind of hard to instantly buy bitcoins due to the irreversible nature of the transactions. To buy using the biggest markets (  you need to be verified by submitting a scan of your ID (among other documents). This process will take more than a week.
There's another alternative,  where you can arrange a meet up with a seller and pay him in cash.
Either way, before buying you'll need a bitcoin wallet and an address. You can learn more at

You can buy fractions of a bitcoin and things can cost a fraction of a bitcoin. Bitcoins follow a decimal division, up to the 8th decimal, which is the smallest posible value (the smallest possible value is called a "Satoshi" or 0.00000001 BTC; 0.001 BTC is a milliBitcoin; 0.000001 BTC a microBitcoin and so on).
You can for example buy a $100 gift card for 0.14 BTC.

There is a branch of cryptography that deals with "hiding" and "uncovering" data on plain sight and is called steganography, I think. It's pretty fascinating, as anything can be used to store data, but there are several statistical methods to find a pattern and potentially decode the hidden data.

This, and the fact that you can use your 51% share of hashing power to legitimately mine more bitcoins.
