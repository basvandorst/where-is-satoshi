I started buying bitcoins back in spring at 3,000 and had only been investing 10 bucks every now and again. Now maybe ~$200 deep, watching the prices jump like this exciting and worrying.

It can make it better by not touching it.

Depends on the context. Do I want clean water regulations to ensure water is clean? Yes. I'd want someone to be making sure my water is clean. Bitcoin, don't touch. There are just some things that can be reasonably regulated and some things that can't.

There is no way imho. If we've learned anything about the FCC and NN, we won't be listened to. There are going to be people who want to regulate something when they see a big reason to regulate and with Bitcoin becoming wild in it's prices, there are going to be people calling for regulation.

If there is anything to be learned from the bitcoin subreddit, it's not about the trading, it's about the HODLing.

If you believe anything about the science of statistics, since Bitcoin's inception it has been gaining value. If you were to do a predictive analysis it will continue to gain value. Admittedly, the data is skewed because it has only ever gained value. Yes, it has dips, and yes, at times the dips were extreme 80% dips, but it has seemed to wheel around. HODLing, seems to be the best tactic in Bitcoin in regards to it's trending price history.
Bitcoin is long term, not exactly short term. Are there gains to be had? Sure. But you're usually safest HODLing. Especially when these price fluctuations make it very hard to buy and sell at opportune moments.

Looking at bitcoin from a very limited understanding of stats, you could make a fair prediction that based on Bitcoin's history it will continue to rise with dips here and there. However, considering the percentage dips it has had, Bitcoin has been known to go from thousands in value to hundreds. If, when, and how much, are impossible to determine especially with where Bitcoin's trend data has been. It's possible to run some predictive analysis on Bitcoin but they wouldn't tell us much other than that Bitcoin is predicted to keep going up based on it's history.
Keep in mind, the history is not accurate because we've only ever seen it go up. If all your data is trending up data, then of course a predictive analysis will say it'll continue to go up. Be careful and safe about your money.

Coinbase is going to be allowing transactions on BCash but they won't be insta transactions. It'll be the "sticky notes" of transactions.
The idea is that it's price is going to skyrocket. How this sounds is, get ready to sell your BCC into BTC. Even as BTC is dipping, it'll come back and the BCC to BTC right now means more BTC due to Bitcoin having a falling trend while BCC has a climbing curve. Ergo, BCC is worth more BTCs so you'll have more BTC as a result. If Bitcoin climbs up again, you'll have even more money.
Correct me if I'm wrong...

Not sure. I haven't looked at Monero at all but what I have read doing a quick Google search, maybe? It seems promising.

And that's true of anything. I think a point of regulations is to impose penalties for doing poor work. Now we know that the reality is that some people still do poor work despite penalties and sometimes penalties are too steep. It's hard figuring out what is appropriate and people will bitch about literally anything and since beurocratic processes are slow, fixing bad regulations take years and then we get people scared of regulations going away once they're there because they feel like it opens a Pandora's box of evil onto our lives.
The world is tricky like that. Looking at bitcoin now, no regulation seems like the best plan for it because it is a bubble, but it is a successful bubble. I think if we ask, "Does it need regulation?" We really need to ask, What about it needs to be regulated? The price fluctuations? Does it need to be taxed? Do we need to regulate who has how much of it? Do we need to find a way to extend its life? Does it need to be adopted by the global market? Is it sustainable? Can it sustain other people? Does it need to be insured? Do we need to make any guarantees on it? Do we need to put just legalize a do not touch approach? Do we need to know who is trading it? Do we need to know what it's being traded for? Do we need to monitor it? Do we need to control how you interact with it? Do we need to protect it from exploitation and vulnerabilities?
There are a lot of questions we can ask in regards to bitcoin in particular and now may be too early to be deciding any of these things. Some of these things go completely against the philosophy of what Bitcoin is and is intended for. Knowing if any of these are necessary is also an issue because we don't know if any of these things are.
However, if people decide that Bitcoin is something that needs someone to take control of it, then we'd probably see price drops because what may be making it fly off the handle is that there is nothing controlling the reigns except for the "Invisible hand" of its market. If someone can convincingly say a regulation that may actually be good for Bitcoin, then maybe. Otherwise, I think we need to continue to observe it and let it go on its own.

Remember, the IRS wants a chunk of that change.

Watch as the US government taxes that as capital assets and income.
IRS: We see that you have 30 million on RuneScape. At the current RuneScape Gold to USD exchange rate, you would owe us 3,000.
Citizen: I don't have 3,000!
IRS: A pity. We will proceed to garnish your wages for the next 10 years and take a 40% chunk of your current RuneScape assets. We'll then require you to report and pay for your continued RuneScape income. Any income over 500 Gold will be considered taxable and at minimum will be taxed 1.5%.

Any modern American financial doctrine would subtextually tell us that anyone who is rich got there because of the hard work they did and shouldn't be penalized for being a hard worker. There is also a chance that they're helping someone. Anyone else should have the book thrown at them because not only are they not rich enough, but they're also lazy, and not helping anyone.

So if you buy $100 in bitcoin now, you'll get the right now value of Bitcoin. If it drops in value, you will have lost money. However, that just means that that Bitcoin you bought will just be worth less. You won't lose the Bitcoin, the Bitcoin just becomes less valuable.
If it drops to $90 dollars value, you'd have lost $10 dollars on your investment. If it goes up to $110, you would have made $10 dollars. Your bank won't be affected unless you buy more Bitcoin or decide to withdraw.
Consider this, you buy a GameBoy and it was with $70. Over time, the GameBoy becomes worth $20. You still have 1 GameBoy. Now suppose there is a retro games fad all of a sudden now that Gameboys are rare and it becomes worth $200. Bitcoin is in a market like that right now. You still have 1 GameBoy, but it's worth whatever the market is demanding for worth. You still have that amount of Bitcoin that you bought, but it's value is whatever the market value for it is.
