Glad I'm out, but in fact I sold everything. No price checking anymore, no overloaded network that would not process my transaction to reach an overloaded exchange. No problems with fiat withdrawal that wouldn't work if really needed. No illusions anymore, good!!!

Unusable. And not likely to scale anytime soon.

What a waste of energy - and no scaling solution in sight.

It seems that Ethereum has surpassed current Bitcoin capacity. Even without another upgrade Ethereum can scale by 4x. I do not see how the Bitcoin blockchain will be able to compete, even in the near future.

I agree, what is your analysis of Caspar+sharding with respect to these metrics?
@_date: 2017-07-22 07:33:38
With $2 transaction fees, good luck!

Many people have said that competing bitcoin forks would be a good thing. The market can decide which one is more viable. Having coins on both chains gives you the choice. However, I fear that it will in general be considered as a negative sign, maybe the market cap will decrease if the disadvantages of the division will become apparent. So far the majority supports the fork with clear technological drawbacks, maybe this will change, but the irrationality will be certainly less sustainable if there is bitcoin alternative.

Mainstream adoption is the key to success for the blockchain ecosystem.

2$ transaction fees, good job!

The short answer is that SegWit allows 1.7x scaling and there are no further scaling solutions in sight since blocksize increase is controversial (and would only give 2x at the moment) and off-chain scaling is still under development.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:00:29
Then better don't tell anyone. More adoption higher fees.

So far my investment ist 200x up and the reason is that Bitcoin is to a large extent a failure looking at the last 2 years.

Let's wait until the BCC/BTC fork becomes apparent. This is the beginning of the end.
@_date: 2017-07-22 07:59:08
Right, it seems complete nonsense. Certainly not a usecase.
@_date: 2017-07-22 07:42:10
Read r/Ethereum, it is an awesome technology that will dwarf bitcoin in all respects. Eth devs have honest scaling solutions in the pipeline and care about the cost of the network. Pow is just too expensive to scale on chain because of the energy costs, pos solves this problem.

Why is it not affiliated with bitcoin anymore ??
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:39:43
Maybe that should be easy to fix, no?
