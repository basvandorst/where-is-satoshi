This is if you wish to move your coins off coinbase.
And into another wallet where you own the private keys.
For things like obtaining coin forks such as bch or btg, and for sending some to a mobile wallet for spending while you are walking around in the world.
For personal safe keeping, buy a ledger nano and send them to that.
I use blockchain.info for mobile wallet (which you don't really need to do since you can pay for things directly with the coinbase app on phone..., electrum for desktop.
There are a lot of wallets out there.

The total number of bitcoins, as mentioned in the question, has an asymptote at 21 million, due to a technical limitation in the data structure of the blockchain - specifically the integer storage type of the transaction output, this exact value would have been 20,999,999.9769 bitcoin. Should this technical limitation be adjusted by changing the width of the field, the total number will still only approach or be a maximum of 21 million.

“When I make my first entrance. I’d like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I’m walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.”

you buy from coinbase then store on a ledger or trezor. 
By the way if you had been around when btc split and you gained equal amounts of bch for every btc you had, you would still not have them because coinbase never released them and you don't have priv key. Keeping a small amount in electrum is ok unless your computer is compromised or dies and you don't have a way to restore the wallet.
or you could just leave them in coinbase. Ledger nano is pretty sweet.
I love blockchain.info for iphone wallet altho many will bash it (greenaddress or breadwallet are apparently popular)
electrum for computer based small amount
and ledger for amounts that if you lost you would jump off a bridge

It's best to buy an S9 or D3 (dash coin) off ebay with a shipper that has it in hand. An R4 is excellent heater and quiet but scarce and pricey.
S9 is VERY loud (watch a youtube video)
It's going to take less time the more BTC increases for ROI.
Does not affect internet speeds lol
If you buy direct AvalonMiner 741 or Antminer S9, you aren't going to get it until Feb ...or later.

no, if you have btc sitting in coinbase and it was sitting in there before 8/1/2017 I think, then you have some.
We are just waiting on coinbase to provide it to us.
Normally you would extract it out of your personal wallet by way of having the private keys. Since coinbase does not provide priv keys, we could not get the BCH.
I think they are going to extract the BCH automatically and so you will just see it there. You might be able to sell directly on coinbase but I highly doubt it. You will need to convert it to BTC or ETH or something or just hold it, or go order some s9 miners...

If you did not have BTC in an address you own at the time of the BCH then you don't have any. I'm not sure what you are talking about but it doesn't make any sense.

Which is why if you create a paper wallet offline and send to it. It will arrive even tho it's an address on a piece of paper. 
Make sure you back up your 12 words for electrum offline in case you need to restore the wallet otherwise they will be lost forever unless you also have the private key for the addresses that have a balance. 
Go into electrum options and you can also display currencies fiat

What is the Seed?
The seed is a random phrase that is used to generate your private keys.
constant forest adore false green weave stop guy fur freeze giggle clock
Your wallet can be entirely recovered from its seed. For this, select the “restore wallet” option in the startup.
How secure is the seed?
The seed phrase created by Electrum has 132 bits of entropy. This means that it provides the same level of security as a Bitcoin private key (of length 256 bits). Indeed, an elliptic curve key of length n provides n/2 bits of security.
I have forgotten my password. What can I do?
It is not possible to recover your password. However, you can restore your wallet from its seed phrase, and choose a new password. If you lose both your password and your seed, there is no way to recover your money. This is why we ask you to save your seed phrase on paper.
Those seed words are for electrum wallet

You also have 12 BCH, which would be $3,876 USD right now ($323 a piece)
You should learn how to obtain the BCH , separate it and then sell it or convert it to BTC or other altcoin if you want) or if you are going to give some back to uncle you should talk to him if he wants to split it himself but don't the let the BCH disappear

custom hardware? The only way to mine bitcoin is to (i) mine it with dedicated miner like bitmain and avalon (ii) mine altcoins and convert to btc (iii) buy cloud hashing. Google bitcoin mining calculator, there a many.

You could tell people to invest in all sorts of things but if they are the type of person who DOESN"T invest out of their own will in anything other than a 401k set it and forget it, then it's really no use even discussing investing with them. If they never even bought a stock on their own before they sure as hell aren't going to dump $1000 into a computer story your sister told them.
