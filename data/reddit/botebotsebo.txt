Absolutely perfect!
Time to give Samourai and Sentinel a whirl, then.

Does it support watch-only addresses (an address without a private key, whose transactions and balance are still monitored)?
I have installed it and played around with it, but this one particular feature is the reason why I can't move off Mycelium just yet. Very few wallets have watch-only addresses, but Mycelium does. 
I like to monitor my cold wallets without sweeping them or risking my phone being stolen.

Excellent. Thanks. 
It appears that I might have been experiencing a minor brain-fart. Obviously the ten-minute average is maintained *after* the blocks have been mined, and the random nature of mining means that the *actual* time difference between any two blocks need not be exactly ten minutes. :-)

So... the Trezor site does not use [HSTS]( to prevent people from ignoring warnings from the browser about dodgy/missing certificates?
