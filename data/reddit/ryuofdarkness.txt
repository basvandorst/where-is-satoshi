Thats fine by me. Can i ask my boss to pay me in bitcoin aswell? For him its just numbers transfer  :P

That is a realisation i see everyday since i work in nature, getting digital payment :D. Kinda annoyed about that fact :P

Yea ur right on that. Just curious for now . Not deep into investing and proper plans with it yet =)

Correct i've found bitcoin on my mental rampage on the internet though. Getting into it slowly now =). Even hardware wallet looking at :P
@_date: 2019-01-22 19:43:44
Yeah, ur right btc has that power.  But the government wants to peep alot, on us all and they will find you if they want. To bad my boss doesn't pay in btc :P. Not much of his concern. Not much difference

Thanks for the warning. No wonder i go offline alot these days. Very dangerous trading and i just have a fresh account at localbitcoins.

@_date: 2019-01-06 13:20:59
Yea indeed thats why i was intrested in it also. and would like to use it in daily transactions =) . I'm used to it now. Feels almost like a bank :P

I'm intrested in the technology behind it aswell. And was eager to adapt it, but in its current stage in europe its a bit bogus =). Slowly gaining the habit of proper handling it and going for a hardware wallet etc. but needs to be in habit rest goes from there
