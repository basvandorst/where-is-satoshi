1. That's were cheaper altcoins get into the game.
2. You're measuring BTC in dollars. By the time a single satoshi is worth that much, bitcoin could be the measurement standard, and a cup of coffee could be bought with a cheaper stablecoin based on BTC. (e.g. 1 examplecoin = 0.0005 BTC Satoshi)

I consider you might be mistaken. Based on past market data and analysis of market behaviour from 2009 to date, 1 Bitcoin will most likely be worth 100,000,000 satoshi.

The chart refers to usage, not quantity. You can buy 0.0005 satoshi (about us$2 at the time of writing).

Because bitcoin doesn´t behave like a currency in the first place, it looks more like gold. The more people are involved in BTC, the more it fluctuates and grow. Is it just me or there isn´t anyone out there saying: hey guys let's buy 10 Swiss Francs before the price goes up. But I do have friends investing in APPL and BTC saying so.

You have a point there. And even if the tools are subconsciously there, you often need an external force to help you tap on them and unleash your potential.
