It's not unusable as a store of value. I can't pay for ANYTHING at the store with gold, can't use it online, and is a physical object which will be degraded by the elements over time. It's still a *store of value* and always will be.

The problem you're facing is that a large share of early adopters and vocal supporters saw these problems with Bitcoin over the last couple years, recognized the intractable inertia of its development team to respond, and long ago made moved into other chains like Litecoin and Ethereum which have clear development roadmaps. 
But sit around and beat your drum hoping shit gets fixed. Don't let me stop you.

Bitcoin worked fine for years, until it got really popular in the last couple. Now it's broken and needs to be fixed, but a lot of the most passionate users and developers have moved onto other projects.

I dont think anybody every expected every single facet of Bitcoin to remain unchanged over the years. As new tools become available and strong encryption against QC attacks is developed, it will be implemented as part of Bitcoin core.

"The hardware must remain an affordable commodity" that's just a dream with any POW that can be ASIC'd. The solution is to change POW so you cant use ASICs (unlikey) or switch to POS, like is planned for Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:09:27
I think that's the whole reason we're forking. Bitcoin was a lot better when it was a bunch of home miners like Etherium has now. When Bitcoin is run by 5-6 mining consortiums, it is essentially centralized which makes it an order of magnitude less secure. 
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:13:02

Scaling, speed, and lower fees won't be achieved anytime soon. The proposed solutions are bandaids on a critically wounded patient. 
All while Etherium and Litecoin continue to rapidly improve and expand while having developer consensus. 
Bitcoin has it's first mover advantage still. That can only last for so long if it doesn't innovate and improve.

Please dont encourage people to trade. Very, very few people will ever beat buying and holding by making a lot of trades. The overwhelming majority of people with a high trading volume will be losers (vs just holding). This is how capitalism and free markets work, vastly more losers than winners.

A hard fork absolutely, positively is an altcoin. But you act as though altcoin is a pejorative word when it's not. 
SHA-256 will always be Bitcoin. Wishing that wasn't the case doesn't change the fact that China owns all the hashing power and will crush any soft fork that attempts to wrangle their control of BTC away. 
Change away from SHA-256, and all these problems go away. The thing is, a guy named Charlie Lee did exactly that a few years ago and the project has been quite successful.

You've got it backwards. Developers made LTC a better coin with more features, so the speculators drove up the price.

It's got issues. The security needs work and they default you to a single for address for all payments which is idiotic. Token support has to be added manually for each token.

Nobodys ever heard of it. I've been in crypto 4 years, I read a lot and I just heard of it last week. I would guess people's awareness of it is somewhere between 100-1000 times less than ETH, and 10,000-100,0000 less than BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:49:06
Those advocating for a hardfork don't seem aware of the fact that Bitcoin already has several successful hardforks, the most well known of which is called Litecoin, but there are many others. If you've been one of those people that's always looked down on Litecoin, and only supported BTC, it's a fairly ironic position that you now find yourself about to be in. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:32:38
We already have a Bitcoin fork with Segwit working. It's called Litecoin.

The scaling problems will eventually be resolved, but on a new chain which isn't SHA-256. Bitcoin developers are no longer in control of the SHA-256 chain. It's China's now.

It's not a roadmap. It's a civil war and China holds all the weapons. We're powerless vs them on any SHA-256 chain. Trying to reboot Bitcoin on something besides SHA-256 at this point is very likely to be impossible. Besides, we already have a successful Bitcoin hardfork: it's called Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:53:10
Anything that isn't a hardfork will be attacked by the miners with their endless SHA-256 hashing power. That's where people are kidding themselves. You think the miners are going to sit on their hands? He'll no. It is going to be a civil war and they have all the firepower.
