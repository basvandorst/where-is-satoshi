From a security perspective, the part of open source that really matters is the "I can look at the source code part" ... the make and share my own modifications are not so important.

From what I read it appears that TOR **does work**, but they have a proof of concept on how to block tor exit nodes from the bitcoin network by triggering bitcoin's anti-DOS.  
The thought then is that you'll give up on TOR and send your transaction over the open web.

That is possible and happening today (and the attack is posisble regardless of fees).  That's why you wait for some number of confirmations before major purchases.

No, they're not.  Not really.  That ^ ^ platitude is what they teach you in government civics class to help get your buy in to the lie that "we are the government".
Look, pretty much any democratic government has explicit consent from much less than half its people.  In the US you're lucky if 40% of eligible voters actually vote, and then the vote goes 55/45 ... so you end up with a government that could perhaps be construed to represent maybe a quarter of their citizens.
For example in the 2012 presidential election 65,915,796 people out of about 310 million voted for Obama ... thats about 21% of the population.
And if the numbers are higher?  What makes 50% + 1 a magical number? We'd never accept that in other contexts (who pays for this meal, lets vote on it!).
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:06:06
Most multi-sig transactions should still be safe right?  This only affects one of the 3 signers.  If customer and seller agree the transaction was completed successfully then the transaction should go through without a hitch.  
If there is unresolved disagreement, then neither party will get funds so the only broken case is where arbitration would have been needed.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:40:16
How so? An attacker has no way to add or change an output and still have the signatures validate.

I'd seen that presentation before. I don't think it makes your case that they basically control TOR.
Obviously though, they very much want to hack it ... and it is *possible* that they've found a way to make TOR transparent to them.  But we have no direct evidence that that is so.
I2P may be stronger ... but its less used ... hard to say.
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:24:31

3. Pharma companies develop drugs for uncommon conditions (by putting such large regulatory hurdles in front that its not cost effective)

The marketplace is quite good at weeding out those types of problems.  People don't like to get sick and die, so businesses that sicken or kill people don't get repeat business and *do* get lots of lawsuits.
Additionally private "FDA-like" companies can easily provide safety certification -- for example the Underwriters Laboratory that's on most consumer appliances.

My view is that it'll equilibrate just fine.  The bitcoin early adopters will either:
1. Spend like hell and become poor again (stimulates the economy, doesn't hurt anyone)
2. Invest (whether they are successful or not this will mean jobs and things created for people)
3. Let it sit in their wallets (does no harm)
