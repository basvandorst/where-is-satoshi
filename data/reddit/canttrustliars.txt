Agreed. Armory makes everything easy. Just make sure the computers are safe/secure/clean prior to setting everything up.

"The government has incentives to keep this statistic as low as possible... Over the past 30 years, the government has changed the way it calculates inflation more than 20 times." (

To be fair, they did pay some semi-large amounts of bitcoins back but it was long, messy process. There's no doubt that they were financially rewarded from the "hack". In a way I tip my hat to them for figuring out a creative way to earn enough capital to do what they want in life. My only hope is that they operate differently now but usually it goes something like, "once a scumbag, always a scumbag."

I basically copy/pasted this from another redditor when they talked about using bitpay or coinbase as a payment processor: 	
"•significantly cheaper transaction fees than credit cards
	•	fast to setup
	•	accept international payments without any extra fees
	•	over night bank deposits (I've been waiting over a week for a Google wallet transfer to clear)
	•	zero charge backs
	•	market to an affluent demographic.
The benefits speak for themselves."

Jesus condones drinking his blood in the form of a drug known as wine so based on that I'd guess not.

I got this message when trying to visit the page: "This page ( is currently offline.

Seems like they were DDOS'd a few days ago according to their Twitter ( maybe it's happening again?

The only problem is that Paymium is operated by lying thieves (instawallet). Would you really want to do business with shady characters like the "CTO" who calls people "idiots" and "whiny bitches" ( &amp;  Does Bitpay work with European merchants yet? If they do, then I'd recommend using them instead due to their solid reputation.

If this guy wants the core devs to "step up" then why doesn't he step up and hire some to work for Circle? These developers are the key to our future, so why not fund them directly if he has the ability to do so?

It says Mike Hearn is an "advisor," whatever that means.  Plus, that's only one person and he's not listed anywhere on Circle's website ( &amp;  Why not hire multiple core devs whose sole purpose is to develop? If I could afford it like Allaire can, I would.
"Allaire went on to compare Hearn to a “strategic consultant” that will help Circle think about how it can expand its businesses in different areas. Furthermore, Hearn told to CoinDesk that his role on the board will be to help the company brainstorm new ideas, share his opinions and offer advice." (

If I had a choice between Bitpay and Paymium I'd use Bitpay. In fact, I'd never use or recommend Paymium solely because of who operates it. If you've followed the actions of their crew as closely as I have, you'd be skeptical too. Do a quick google search for davout+paymium+instawallet, and see what shows up. Have fun digging through all the dirt.

It makes much more financial sense to accept BTC for any transaction. There's no reason why the Petrodollar should exist in the future.

I think you're confused about what an exchange is. Exchanges can't pay you in cash, they wire you funds to a bank account that you set up with them. You have to make a sell order on the bitcoins you sent to the exchange which is simple if you sell your coins at the current market price. After that you can have the funds you exchanged your bitcoins for wired to your bank account. Something like localbitcoins / mycelium function as sort of an intermediary where you can arrange deals with people using those services to acquire cash. You can also ask around here:

Put some away that you can't touch for a while. You're only 21 so you have a lot of time to earn more of whatever currency you want. Plus you'll thank yourself after btc appreciates.

Not at all. The strength of the Bitcoin network makes Bitcoin much more trustworthy / secure than any other coin. Doge is also an inflationary currency unlike Bitcoin and Litecoin.

Purchasing goods from a company in China is not the same as working directly with a financial institution in China with only an American debit card. If you happened to travel to China and try to use your Visa without notifying your card-issuer, you'd probably wind up with your card being temporarily disabled until you did notify them of your plans.

You can buy things with your debit card from Amazon, ebay, and Netflix because they're American companies that aren't focused on banking/finance. You can't use your card for international banking because of the intimidation tactics used by the US. If you did try to use your card for an international purchase you might be blocked by the financial institution that issued your card if you didn't notify them first. Blame the corrupt assholes in charge. Since you're in America, try coinbase although you will probably have to wait a few more days if you register now.

If a bank didn't want to give a loan based only on the fact that the customer has used Bitcoins then it'd be best to stay away from that bank anyway.
