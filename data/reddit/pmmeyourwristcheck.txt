Your reasoning is incorrect.
The value from a "gadget" comes from the utility extracted over its useful life.
All assets are depreciated to zero. That doesn't take away from the fact that they provided benefits and value throughout its life.

I am curious about Bitcoin but I have a hard time wrapping my head around it. I understand the blockchain provides very useful technology that can improve processes in many different industries. It has the ability to make certain transactions secure, fast and cheap. And that's great.
So I expect many businesses to build businesses around the blockchain.
But I don't understand why Bitcoin has to be worth XYZ number of USD.
Why can't Bitcoin just be worth $0.50 USD, and still retain all the blockchain properties?

the whole purpose of QE was to counter deflationary pressures post financial crisis.
Fed Chair Ben Bernanke is an expert on the Great Depression, specifically an expert on the threat of deflation. This is common knowledge.
Keep responding, I don't mind embarrassing you.

ALL technology is deflationary, not just Bitcoin.

How about get your story straight, because you make no fucking sense.
Which story are you going to stick by? Counter deflationary causes hyperinflation? Or doesn't cause hyperinflation.
YOU SAID BOTH in all your retarded comments.

I trade markets full time.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:13:02
You are doing a spectacular job of keeping me skeptical of Bitcoin.
Good luck to you

Furthermore, you believe were in this era of massive inflation, yet two of the largest inputs of inflation - oil and crops (energy and food) have gone nowhere over the last 10 years. Oil is MINUS 50% from 2007.
Another large input of inflation is wage growth. Wage growth has been tracking less than +3% for the last 9 years and only started to tick over 3% last fall. That is a lower rate than the 90s thru mid 00's.
You have no idea what you're talking about.

Outside of healthcare and education (impacted by regulatory and government intrusion), we are not in an inflationary environment.

That was my comment. This is true. Accept it, don't respond w/ some silly retort about Strawmen.
Nothing you have said makes any sense.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:49:30


I'm sorry, I just can't have a serious conversation with you if you don't understand economics or QE.
Let me clear this one point up for you: Without QE we would be in a massive deflationary spiral. *NOT* hyperinflationary.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:47:29


I didn't ask a question only for you to answer with another question.
Explain why the price of BTC matters at all when you are using the blockchain in a commercial application (ie Escrow).

Monetary policy was running ZIRP for YEARS and there's barely any hint of inflation.
Where is this hyperinflation you're talking about? Years of ZIRP and nothing.
You seriously have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:38:14


Incredible. Did you forget at one point the laptop was *new* and maximum utility was extracted then?
If people like you are the ones bidding up the price of BTC, its absolutely a bubble.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:51:32
I'm sorry you can't understand basic economics.
You think the only value a 10 year old laptop has is its resale value.
You have no concept of utility.
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:25:43
You're a moron. I gave you the definition of QE and it's intended purpose.
You can't clearly convey your ideas, and you clearly don't know what you're talking about.
You're so confused about everything.

��THIS IS WHAT YOU SAID.
You're a retard that has no argument, no facts, and hides behind smears of strawmen.

This is incorrect because your presumption is QE would cause hyperinflation.
QE as a policy was instituted to ward off deflation and promote confidence and liquidity to the market.
You don't know what you're talking about.

I'm going to try one more time with you. I asked the following question:




Your response:


In that dodo brain of yours, do you think you adequately answered my question **why Bitcoin can't be worth only $0.50, yet still retain the benefits of blockchain technology?**
