Thanks for doing that! I reported them to Google and I didn't even think of YouTube! I'm trying to get LocalBitcoins to take this matter seriously, but my communications with them have been less than impressive.

I've submitted a couple of support tickets and just got a canned reply from one of their support members who didn't properly read what I wrote in the ticket :-/
Hopefully someone more observant will pay attention to the other report I submitted to them.

Exactly...

I reported them to Cloudflare last week. I guess they haven't seen the report yet

Thanks for your kind words and the update! I've been reporting that site everywhere I can to get them shut down.

Thanks for this information! I took a peek at the whois record as well. I'm starting to gather evidence, not in hopes of getting my bitcoin back, but in hopes of finally making some people accountable for preying on people who are trying to simply support Crypto.

I definitely didn't give it my password, but since I haven't made a trade before, I was assuming that there would be other safeguards before a transaction like this would happen. Even my wallet doesn't let me send anything over 0 BTC without emailing me a verification code! That's after I have to enter my password and a pin number just to get into my wallet!

Thanks :-) Ya, I definitely let my guard down there... I really expected LocalBitcoins to do a better job of trying to protect their users, but they just simply tow the "buyer beware" line.

Honestly, I'm surprised that there was no mention of this on Reddit before me! There appears to be minimal chatter in the LocalBitcoins forum back in October, which appears to be when the site went live, but I can't believe LocalBitcoins hasn't done anything about this! Even a big warning for everyone who signs up to not trust SafeTrader.io would suffice. 
It can't be enough for these sites to just assume users have the best practices at hand. I'm not an idiot when it comes to this stuff (although I am an idiot for falling for it), but I simply just let my guard down. There was a comedy of errors as to my reasoning, but it was my mistake nonetheless.

I'm really hoping more people upvote this to keep it on the main page for a while, just so that we can warn as many people as possible. It looks like this guy has taken at least 25 btc (from what I can understand when looking at the wallet address my money went to).
