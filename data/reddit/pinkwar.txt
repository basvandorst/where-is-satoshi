Isn't single funded channel a feature of lightning network?  
I'm pretty sure I read it somewhere.
"**Single-funded channels**: when Alice needs to send a payment to Bob and doesn't currently have a way to pay him through the Lightning Network (whether because she can't reach him or because she doesn't have enough money in an existing channel), she can make a regular on-chain payment that establishes a channel without Bob needing to add any of his funds to the channel. Alice only uses 12 bytes more than she would for a non-Lightning direct payment and Bob would only need about 25 more segwit virtual bytes to close the channel than he would had he received a non-Lightning direct payment."  
Or this thing is not being developed?

You answered it yourself. Fees will become market driven. Each nodes will charge a fee. Nobody knows until we get there.
One thing is certain. Whoever gets the first node funded with a lot of bitcoin will earn more. As with almost everything, early adopters gain more. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:56:23
I was talking about satoshi vision and he also envisioned that miners will be incentivized by fees.

You are talking like a block size increase would be done with a 100% consensus.
That would just split the network, create 2 bitcoins, double spend problems, 51% attacks, network vulnerability, exchanges going down, bugs in the software, nodes number going down by the thousands, and so on. 
If you want bigger blocks just go for bcash. Bitcoin already forked for what you're asking.

So imagine this situation:  
Bitcoin has hit the reward limit and no more coins are created.  
Miners have no incentive to mine because fees are too low.  
Hashrate drops drastically lets say from 25TH to 1 TH, difficulty readjust and only a bunch a nodes are currently mining blocks.   
Now all those miners are taking dust, someone spins them up to rewrite the blockchain. Is this a possible vector of attack? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:32:46

It might be because of the high traffic, but it has been a day and I still can't make a single payment.   
It clearly shows we are not ready for mainnet.  
But the thing that is bothering the most is that when I hit the "Pay" button there is still the previous payment address in there. 
Also there is no "paste" button, I can't right click+paste, there is no scan the QR code. Doesn't feel user friendly at all.  
I've used eclair desktop wallet, android, lnd on ubuntu and nothing was as hard as setting up channels on this.   
I can't specify the amount of BTC (shouldn't it say tBTC) I want when I open a channel.  
There is no way to tell that its going on testnet if you have no clue what you are doing.   
It should always say tBTC instead of BTC.  
Sorry for the long post, I'm just frustrated that a day as passed and I can't still use this to buy fake coffee.

Straight right from the whitepaper: "the incentive(for miners) can transition entirely to transaction fees " 
Sure low or zero fees was a feature at the beginning, but in no way it was bitcoin's vision to be free.  
It was always about incentivizing the miners to keep mining.   
I would recommend to everyone to read the whitepaper to see what the vision was. It is a very interesting read.

The problem is that you don't use same level as conservative for the world population using bitcoin.
It is not reasonable to think every child will have a wallet. Even 2 billion adults don't have a bank account.
It is not reasonable that every oldschooler at the brink of death will have a wallet.
It is not reasonable to think of todays technology for a scaling problem 10 years into the future.
I would use 1 billion as a pretty good approximation for the near term. But anyway, scalability issues is not only everyone having a wallet.
The future is micropayments and smart contracts. For that, it is obvious that blockchain alone will never be able to accommodate.
Edit : I would like to point out that micropayments scalability is far more important in the present than banking the underbanked.

If you want the bitcoin to show on coinbase the bitcoin has to be on coinbase wallet.    
Click "withdraw" -&gt; "coinbase wallet".

I see a lot of red.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:19:00
How do i do that with bitcoin core wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:54:50
Run ubuntu , set up bitcoin node, run lightning. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:15:31
You can send directly to a segwit address.Even from gdax or coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:42:14
First you should be using a segwit address. 
Second, it is not weird. It is normal. 
Third, yes there are services which you pay for to have your transaction sped up.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:21:02
Yes you should get a new autocorrect. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:14:10
In the technology we trust. Hodl we must. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:03:53
some people don't have access to usd. So they used usdt/btc to buy bitcoin thinking that 1usd=1usdt
a lot of exchanges use usdt/btc ticker 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:36:31
Also, by volume, bitcoin is down by half. From 18 to 9. So there is your answer.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:32:54
How do I install this? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:03:16
Mining doesn't matter. It doesn't affect in any way the network.
Its only a point of failure with an easy fix if it happens.

Only for the more tech savvy as there are still bugs and you can lose funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:27:58
Yes you can do that but OP blindly trusted the instructions or lack of he got. Because I think even ledger tells you to factory reset the device and how to do that in the manual. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:30:58
Yet he doesn't say that litecoin is bitcoin. That's the point. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:35:26

Didn't satoshi invisioned that you should use 1 address for each transaction?   
At least thats what my core wallet or nano S wallet do.  
What you can do is one address for each client and never consolidate all or course.

Where can I see the nodes on mainnet?
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:14:41
Definitely just a couple of people could have driven the price of bitcoin from 0 to 1000 very easily by doing that.  
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:47:44
It makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:11:24
It's going to be 2 long crawling weeks before difficulty adjusts. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:07:04
That's exactly the situation people think we are right now.
Tether pumped the price of bitcoin by faking coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:42:02
How to turn this into the mainnet?

If you don't sell you can't realize your losses! Be smart!  
Hodl onto your coins.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:44:18
Companies will try to create their own coin and try to push it out to the public over and over to see what sticks.   
The problem is that people are becoming well informed of what it means to have a truly decentralized, censorship resistant, leaderless coin.  
And that is **bitcoin**, the only one that has already been tested versus all kinds of attacks.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:23:50
Not everybody has the technical knowledge to do that.   
edit: but obviously I cheer the initiative.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:11:19
You can also say that when Jesus started saying he was the son of god, a blasphemy, inciting war among the people, they killed him.

At least these guys dont force you to buy bcash.  
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:22:46
Segwit and all future forks are backwards compatible. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:33:18
So that's why btc is up. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:55:02
That number means nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:13:38
If you can fund your node than yes. But the fees will be very low. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:56:42

I agree with you.
I wouldn't trust just my memory to keep my funds safe.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:33:40
Just send them bitcoin onchain. What the hell?
You can also single fund channels if you really want to send btc to your friend via LN.
There is a whole great presentation about single funded channels on YouTube by Tadge Dryja.

12 words is very easy.
You can use memory placement where you imagine a room you're familiar with and by order you 'hide' the words in it.
Like in the doorknob, right wall, bed, pillow, secretary, chair, window, etc. 
There are many techniques to memorize stuff pretty easily. Just requires a little bit of set up if you are not familiar with them.

Will you continue hodling or just sell and forget about this great technology?
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:33:49
We went from 186k transactions on the backlog to 40k now.   
So yes, people stopped using it. There is no arguing about that.    
It is not segwit, it is not higher blocks, it is not LN.  People are just transacting a lot less. In fact, almost 5 times less.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:59:49
This is the dip that will end it all.

Because they refuse to mine low fee transactions.

@_date: 2017-12-15 03:03:13
I sometimes also ask myself that.
Am I really supporting the right team?  Am I being deceived into thinking bitcoin is going to change for the better? That roadmaps are going to be fulfilled?   
One thing you can be sure.  Coders/devs are very proud on what they do.  They don't stop until every inch of code is verified and things work perfectly. They tear apart each others works to find flaws and feel joy when they find one.   
You can bet that these devs are going to come up with something really useful in the future that we all be proud to have been part of.   
Will it be bitcoin? I'm sure that at least history will be made from this community.
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:03:26
What's the case if you claim that you lost the keys to your wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-29 12:24:03
Owning bitcoin has its ups and downs.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:48:04
Your ideals are the same as always.   
As mine are. I want a coin that is disconnected to the central banks.  
I want to be able to pay instantly with little to no fees. 
I want to do it privately on a trustless system.   
I want to give people with no bank, a chance into the financial system.  
I want smart contract payments. Micro payments. Machine to machine payments.   
All this can come with bitcoin. That's why I support it.  
If bitcoin achieves this, than its value wont matter. We wont have to think in fiat ever again.  
Let the millions of newcomers think only about the money while devs and the community work for a better goal.  They are in their own right to put their money on bitcoin. After all this is censorship resistant.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:46:50
DCA is the way to ride bitcoin.

There's so much you can do locally that will fill your heart in a way more close to you.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:16:56
LN doesn't allow double spending. The network will only care about the 1st transaction seen by it.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:07:04
That should be right indeed.
I don't think that guy would've invested 50% into bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-18 15:42:20
Roger ver bcash points of failure right there.

Don't try to catch a falling knife.

Tell me about the noise and heat when you plug that in.
Having a miner is awesome in the winter because it dries your clothes and keeps the house warm.

How can someone trust a coin that has a difficult adjustment to keep it as profitable to mine as bitcoin?
Could someone try to explain it to me how can that work in the long run?

They can't tell you a thing if money is being held by anti-money laundering laws.   
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:00:38
The problem with bitcoin is that it gained too much traction before it was ready.  
I have no problem with waiting more time so we don't forfeit our decentralized, trustless, censorship resistant coin. If for some reason we have to give up on some of those values, bitcoin has failed.   
Bitcoin has been attacked so many times and it only puts sets back on it.   
Give all the devs time to do their job/hobby right and don't rush them just because of a minor set back.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:02:14
Sure on the surface bcash looks better at the moment.
But would you trust a coin that has problems of centralization?
Bitcoin has proven over and over that can survive attacks from all fronts.
Bcash is the reason we want to get away from banks and its creating that problem Satoshi wanted to solve. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:51:23
Are we going to see past 20k today?
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:44:59
If everyone held their thousand coins and never used them bitcoin would never get to a point where it is now.   
We can thank your brother for moving bitcoin up from the ground.

The users back in August were way fewer than the new users coming now.
They have more buying power than the sellers. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:45:41
Bcash has a ceo, a lead developer and a spokesman owner of bitcoin.com trying to mislead newcomers into believing bcash is bitcoin.
If bcash didn't have those big red flags I would consider thinking of supporting it at some extension. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:08:45
Sadly, I agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:24:14
I love your analogy. People are so impatient with LN. Don't rush this thing otherwise we might have problems down the road. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:22:54
You would rather see them coming here wasting time or working on code?   
Theres just a limited hours in a day.  
Let the people who work on bitcoin do their work. Otherwise go educate yourself and contribute.  Bitcoin is opensource.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:19:11
Yes you are right. 
I see lightning network as a prepaid card with bitcoin with the ability to get money back from the card.  
You load up your card and use it on LN as you may see fit for as long as you like. When you want out you just close it and retrieve whatever you have left.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:58:31
If they keep their promise on releasing bcash I will be happy.   
About segwit adoption, I really don't see it ever coming until at least LN comes online.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:00:48
Something like, if you try to cheat the system you lose all your money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:57:50
ITT people only want bitcoin because of the easy free money.
That's how bubbles burst. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:19:11
Who will force you to not spend the bitcoin on the blockchain after you use it on LN?   
Your proposal makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:12:50
In the later releases everything complex should be done in the background by the client.   
First we will have to deal with some technicalities with a less friendly UI.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:50:18
Bitcoin is like funding a startup.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:59:08
On a technical point bigger blocks leads to less people able to validate transactions.
Also Roger ver and jihan friends are a big red flag. If you have authority you have clear centralized power creating a point of failure. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:12:30
Everyone clearly knows you have to follow ABC otherwise your forks dies. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:12
This isn't like core devs are the only group working on bitcoin. LN has a different group of people. 
How do you want core to answer for them? 
Most of them have jobs that let them not be only focused on bitcoin.
Why don't you contribute instead of demanding?
The roadmap is the same as before that is in their blog.

It is indeed in the roadmap of scalability something to dynamically increase or decrease the blocksize. But honestly I think it will never happen.

incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on allowing miners to produce larger blocks at some cost."

Bitcoin is pathing new territories so its going to get a lot of attacks and bumps on the road.  
Ive only been around bitcoin since 2015 but I think I understand your frustration.   
It sucks that you can't just press a button and change things for the better.  I know we've been waiting for LN or schorr signatures for years but now we can almost taste it. 
Sometimes you need to go back before going forward. If you believed in the initial values of bitcoin you are on a great path.

He is definitely not a get rich quick idiot.

You are not thinking straight.   
If you want your bitcoin to convert to fiat for some reason just send it to the exchange via LN. 
Once you open  the channel it can connect to everyone without opening multiple channels.  
The idea is big retailers and exchanges will connect to everyone.     
You don't need to close the channel to get your bitcoin back.   
Unless you want to store your bicoin into some cold storage, there is no need to ever close the channel.

Halvening price has been already factored in a long time ago.
You're very naive if you think people don't think long term when making investments. Do you really think on the day of the halvening it will be madness of people realizing they only get 6.25 bitcoins per block now? 
Block reward will have very little impact on bitcoin price. We already mined more then 85% of the bitcoins.
 
Let me make a prediction for you.
Some miners will shutdown because it won't be profitable for them anymore. 
You corroborate my point. Gold price would go up if you knew supply will be cut in half, not 1 year later on the day of the cut.

Coinbase fees are not high if you use bank transfers. It's 2.99€ for any transaction.

They are offering a different kind of service.
I understand your point and its far better to be holding your own bitcoins.
Revolut for example does the same thing, lets you buy bitcoin, but only as an investment (you can't send it to another wallet or use it in another kind of way). They are partnered with Bitstamp to take care of the holding for them.  
Overall it's better than nothing.
@_date: 2019-08-04 19:15:58
Bitcoin high volatility makes it almost impossible for a business to be holding bitcoin after a payment. 
So the only solution is a system to receive the bitcoin and quickly sell for USD or swap it for a stable coin.

Make a rough estimate.
Buying coins at $500 or $50 doesn't make a big difference in the tax you have to pay.
Let's say you bought 50 BTC:
50 x ( $10000 - $500 ) = **475k** "profit" **tax** = 71k
50 x ( $10000 - $400 ) = **480k** "profit" **tax** = 72k
50 x ( $10000 - $50 ) = **497,5k** "profit" **tax** = 74k

Such a long post and not a single word about bitcoin.  
It's a shame that 90% of the people in this sub only cares about making money out of bitcoin.
Let me tell you my story.
I heard about bitcoin in the beginning of 2016 because of a gaming website that accepted it and was offering a discount or something like that.  
I looked for ways to buy bitcoin, I found coinbase and got some and bought the game with it.  
I started to search more about bitcoin.  
I learnt about this Lightning technology and the possibility of micropayments. It could change the world.  
Machines could "pay" each other with this technology. 
I could read some articles paying some cents on the click of a button. 
I could transact a million times on it and no one would be the wiser about it. 
Money is only one application of bitcoin. 
21M coins, censorship resistant, decentralized, permissionless, opensource, fungible, transactions not reversible and trustless.
This is bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:51:46
I'm not a big fan of Roger Ver but posts like this make this sub look really bad.   
Just acknowledge the good he did to bitcoin and that he now wants to pursue bigger blocks.   
Just because he has a different opinion doesn't mean that he is corrupted or evil.   
You should make efforts to kill the message not the messenger. 
This post is just plain witchhunting.

If you want to accept bitcoin in your business you can't. But you can with bcash. Simple as that.
Where did I say bcash scales better with onchain vs bitcoin offchain?   
Bitcoin doesn't even have offchain scalability yet.

How can you purchase something when a transaction takes days to confirm?  
And I'm not even talking about the ridiculously high fees.

Exactly this. If you're only here for the easy quick money you are only contributing for the making of a bubble.
Contribute in adoption and the price will go up on his own. Stop spreading the idea of bitcoin making everyone rich.
Everyone well knows where that kind of thinking leads.
User adoption and a healthy grow of the network is everything in bitcoin. If people can't use it, it just becomes a speculation bubble.

Nice counter argument. But I've been here long enough to know that's the truth.

So Roger Ver pushed bitcoin onwards for 6 years before bcash.  
I guess we shouldn't follow bitcoin either...  
See the flawed logic?   
He now wants to scale bitcoin in a different way. That's the beauty of open source.   
Con artist or not, what he says is true. Bitcoin is in a hell of a pickle right now in terms of scalability. Mempool doesn't lie about that.   
 
Focus on the message and not if he is black, white, made mistakes in the past or not.  People learn and change. Otherwise prisoners would never leave if we didn't think reform was a thing.  
The messenger doesn't matter, its all about the technology.  
Posts like these only give bcash more power to exist.

The difference is that I wasn't asking about being hacked. But if you insist on that: even if they could go pass 2FA, which I find very unlikely, with my credit card or bank account purchases I could whine about it to the bank and get my money back. There is no crying in bitcoin over loss coins to get them back.      
Way to change the subject because you are not willing to agree because reasons.

Just wait until someone bans bitcoin or mining.  
Chinese gov is calmly waiting.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:06:05
If people want to use bitcoin everywhere they go and make purchases with it the technology needs to improve.  
Best way from what I've read is to implement trustless 2nd layer like Lightning Network and not really by increasing block size like bcash.  
The problem/feature is that bitcoin is coded in a way that make these changes hard and slow.   
If you want bitcoin in just as a store of value, taking 1 second or 12 hours to confirm a transaction is not a big deal. But than you would need bcash for those instant transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:53:54

First people need to accept the changes like segwit.
We are barely at just 50% adoption.
We got ourselves the blocksize increase and some big players still refuse to use it so they can push the blocksize increase agenda.

There's an error check if you make the same payment twice in a row it will give an error to avoid duplication of payments.
It's not about using the same card, its about paying the same amount in a short period of time.
You don't need to wait 30 minutes though. Just pass it again and it will charge the card.

Where is your source that bitcoin will always increase in value?
That price increase will be already factored in way before bitcoin becomes stable.
Pretty much like halvening price increases. They are factored in way before it happens. So when bitcoin goes mainstream, if ever, the price will be stable or tagged to something else. Usdt?

And no, that price didnt include the PSU or shippings.  That price isn't even for the next available batch and usually they go up in price.    
But whatever, I'm just warning you that you're doing the math wrong.

You are missing the difficulty increase and you forget that the miners you buy now are only delivered in a month.

Bad reviews are from people that have no clue what they are buying.   
Nano S can't be tampered that's why there isn't a tampering seal or whatever.   
The amount of comments about the possibility of it being tampered because it doesn't have a seal or because isn't bought from the producer directly just makes me laugh.   
Whatever you buy make sure you get informed correctly and not read too much into bad comments full of ignorance from amazon reviews.

Ive bought into genesis mining last year and it 3x my investment.

If price was 20000 you would get ROI in one month.  
What acids are you on?  
There are 3 constants: initial price, price of electricity and pool fee. Thats your cost. 
It is obvious that if bitcoin price goes up you make more money. Unless for some abnormal reason electricity price went up proportionally at the price of bitcoin. 
The only thing that goes up is the price that bitmain asks for the S9. And yes, that usually is factored with ROI in mind. So bitcoin goes up, miner equipment go up.

Lightning is supposed to be for micro payments.  
Spending money.  
You don't withdraw money from an ATM, put on your wallet, spend some and go to the bank deposit the change.

The bitcoin cash fork was done knowing it would become a minority chain, thats why it has DEA and so on.   
B2X is made to be the main one and kill the original chain. That's why.

This is the reason why you don't just rush a hard fork.   
There is absolutely no need to push this forward.
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:43:53
Its just some investor that got in and drove the price up.   
Nothing changed.  Bitcoin is so volatile anyone with some millions can move it around.   
When enough people buy in at this new ATH the price will fall drastically as always.   
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:26:32
What do you mean you bought on the fork?   
You mean on the ATH?

You can always trust scammers to keep pumping their coin.

Wait for the day he goes again onto national tv to speak about bcash and you will see a pump.

Bitcoin cash stupid EDA gives a lot of problems to bitcoin with miners going back and forth on the chain.

I don't care if it is 1000, 200000, 100 or 10. I already made my share from bitcoin and all I care now is when I can switch everything to bitcoin and start using it everyday around the world.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:05:45
This is really not that good of an idea. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:37:46
How is this possible?   
Bitcoin transactions are too costly to be even be thinking about it.
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:47:52
Only governments can force on you the change of currency like they did with gold.  
So replacing fiat with bitcoin does not happen overnight.

Some payments take some minutes, maybe because of routing.

Ofc it is if the price keeps going up.  
But overall it is a safer bet to just buy the bitcoin upfront.  
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:28:02
You should go study the problems of deflation.
If your money would be worth more tomorrow why would you ever spend it?
Consumption decreases, prices fall, profits fall, unemployment increases, production halts, less money, less investment, more people out of jobs, less money.

Not your keys not your bitcoins to get stolen.   
This doesn't make sense.   
What you are asking is how easy is a thief to steal a credit card, make purchases and get away with it.   
He wouldn't get away with your money because you have credit card theft insurance and chargebacks.
@_date: 2018-07-02 07:17:39
People forget that 80% people only bought into bitcoin after last year 5000.

You don't lose it all. All cards have theft protection.
Also if you are holding gold in a safe you probably would have that insured anyway.
At the moment Bitcoin is not secure. If someone held a gun to my head I would lose all that I invested. That wouldn't happen with the money at my bank.
Money at exchanges, hot wallets, paper wallets all is not safe at all.

Let the dust settle after the fork and than look for advice on how to proceed.   
Doing nothing is the best course of action so you can learn what can go wrong and what not.   
Until then just enjoy life and don't think much about it.  
We still have more than 1 month to go.

I have my coins stored in a Nano S and I will keep them in there. Wait for the dust to settle after the fork and decide what to do. I would advise to take them out of coinbase do you don't get screwed like the bitcoincash fork.   
Coinbase should release a statement before the fork anyways. We still have 40 days to figure out the course of action.

To put it simple:
We need a lot more nodes, in theory everyone should be running their own node. We are moving towards mobile world. We need full node on our phone and the hardware is not there yet.  
Even if block size increases, there will always be someone using the blockchain to fill it with garbage if its cheap, so fees won't get lower if block size gets bigger.
We need 2nd and 3rd layer to small transactions because those don't need the high security of the main chain.
