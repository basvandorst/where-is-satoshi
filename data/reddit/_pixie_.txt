Right, imagine a serious bug being found in Bitcoin tomorrow and it all becoming worthless instantly. Many people will have the same regret of not selling. No one knows the future - hedge your bets.

This thread is like the support group I've been looking for. I've been dealing with a lot of regret over bitcoin as well. OP you may of saved some lives with this thread.

Seriously that was a write up about absolutely nothing. Literally, 'I have an idea and clear vision' with no idea or vision to be seen. 100% bullshit. People who think this way are a dime a dozen.

Price? Is dollars converted to gold more valuable than dollars converted to bitcoin?
@_date: 2012-09-17 04:07:19
If a government carried a surplus of bitcoins they could use these to buy bonds from bitcoin banks, or offer bonds to bitcoin banks. Effectively becoming what the federal reserve is today.  The difference is they couldn't print more bitcoins to buy bonds and increase the money supply. They would have to raise taxes in order to do that. Which I think is much more transparent and responsible because today inflation is used as a shadow tax make government debt worth less without raising taxes.

Coins are lost forever and the rest of the currency is slightly deflated (yay everyone's coins are worth slightly more!)

This is a great way protect against the future risk of bitcoin being legislated against. More donations to politicians through bitcoin!

Words (much like money) has no intrinsic meaning. It's value is what we assign to it.  The problem with the word fiat is that a lot of people have assigned different meanings to it. The characteristics section of this page have 3 such meanings, none 'official' because there is no official meaning (of any word) therefore if the word is too subjective and thus should be refined further.

Reminds me of early 2000s when the economy was 'bad' and they lowered interest rates to nothing causing banks to lend for nothing, causing people to buy houses they couldn't afford.
Seriously the economy is always bad in some respect. No one will ever be happy with an unemployment rate above 0%. 
I've come to the conclusion that our over-consumption is a direct result of over-inflation.  You can't keep your money under the mattress because it will lose value. So we put it in banks that have to reinvest it to beat inflation.  Reinvestment forces companies to grow endlessly. They grow by making us think we need to buy more and more products.  
Basically causing us to rape our natural resources to feed needless growth because the government keep devaluing the currency to pay for debts, wars and 'bad economies.'

I hope you live long enough for asteroid mining to bring back enough gold that it becomes essentially worthless.

I won't touch coinbase until it has client-side wallet encryption like blockchain.info.  Has no one learned? If a third-party has access to your private key, you're gonna have a bad time.

We need a way to distinguish Bitcoin as 'fiat' currency from government backed currencies because at the moment its a semantics nightmare . Like maybe 'mathematically fiat' and the other 'gov fiat,' as a way to say to that gov fiat can be created at will, while mathematical fiat cannot.  We could call gold 'pretty fiat' as it's value is determined by it looking good. During the apocalypse Twinkies have more intrinsic value than gold.
@_date: 2012-08-02 23:09:46
Gold has no intrinsic value other than people agree that it's valuable.  It's hard to create more gold - that's what makes it non-fiat. Guess what, bitcoins are even harder to create than gold, and while we might find an asteroid filled will gold (shocking the gold economy,) you're not going to find any more than 21 million bitcoins. Bitcoin has the potential to be even more fair, and easy to transfer in seconds (try to move gold across the world in seconds.) Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of gold, and better.

The article seems to be written by someone who hasn't taken econ 101.
@_date: 2012-09-17 05:29:52
Do you agree that if bitcoin becomes more popular then governments are going to start stockpiling large quantities of it?
@_date: 2012-09-20 00:49:24
Decorative qualities lol. That's only important when there's some sort of stability in the economy. Might as well use bitcoins. If you're talking about the system breaking down then your gold is going to be pretty useless. I'll trade my fish for clean water. Thanks, but you can keep the gold.

Here's my question... why aren't private keys for these centralized wallets encrypted with a password the user has to put in when they do a transaction. This way private keys aren't stored on disk, but only temporarily in memory. Also if the encrypted keys get stolen, there's time for people to move their money to new wallets before the encryption is broken.
@_date: 2012-09-05 05:51:58
Answered my own question -  has an online wallet that works just like this.

most bitcoins people buy are not 'freshly mined.' it doesn't matter if there are no more new coins.. if you want coins you go to an exchange and buy some from people selling. obviously the absence of new coins in the system will push the price up in the future, not down. this is econ 101.

Gold's 'other' properties are dependent on the society using it. For industrial use - you need an industrial society. For just jewelry you need a society for metalworking skills. If you're on a desert island gold has no value - you can't eat it and it won't give you shelter. Water may be an even better unit of exchange in a post-apocalyptic society, but lets be practical here. If you're looking for something like gold that is also much easier to transfer around the world, harder to counterfeit, and easier to store - then Bitcoin is what you want. If you're stockpiling for the breakdown of society - then yea buy some gold.

Bitcoin's intrinsic value IS its ability to move at the speed at light, difficulty to counterfeit and difficulty to produce.
