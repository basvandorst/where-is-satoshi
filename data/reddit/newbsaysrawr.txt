If you start to feel a little hot, it's because everything is always on fire. It's normal so don't worry

Is there a threshold for how much you have to pay taxes on? For example, lets say you drop $80 into BTC when prices are low, then when you have about 250 worth, cash out 100 and move the rest to alt coins. 
IIRC, BTC -&gt; Alt requires no tax payments, as you didn't gain fiat.
What about the 100 though? Do you pay taxes on the $20 realized net fiat profit, or do you pay it on more? If you bought at multiple points but sold at a single point, and only sold a portion of what you bought, do you only pay taxes on the overall net gains (even though you still have most of your coins), or do you pay it differently? Then, later down the road you cash out your altcoins, do you pay taxes on them too? 
Am I really going to have to pay the government like $5 on my crypto profits?

Even if I used a site like shapeshift.io, going from a private wallet to another wallet? Never touched my bank account.

"Mom, dad, I've made it big, XOXO from mount olympus"
Kidding of course. It will probably be pretty jarring for them, this kind of thing wasn't around back then. It's probably a good call to set up a family meeting with a serious tone and preface it by saying you learned a skill and made some money in a legal / morally sound way, that if they want you can explain it in detail, but the major point is you made money in a new economy thats rising and that it *is* a good thing, albeit complicated. 
I would also suggest talking to them about support and maybe talking to a family lawyer or financial manager if you have one about how to smartly manage the money. 
Best wishes OP

I uh... I have 0.0025btc... That I bought around 4-4.2k...

You could buy a pretty solid ferrari with bitcoin. 
How does that make you feel OP? 
Obligatory *hey its me ur brother*
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:34:05
Woulda been cool to know that before I dropped 25 bucks in coinbase lol. Thankfully I have a private wallet now.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:04:53
The analogy was very helpful, thanks

Hodl... Just a bit longer... 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:06:49
Wait... You at first said that buying bitcoin isnt the subject, that the taxation comes from using bitcoin for fiat purposes like getting USD or making purchases, i.e deriving fiat value from it. If thats the case, why count all times I bought bitcoin? I thought you were saying I wont be accountable for taxes on bitcoin I bought, only those I used / cashed out

Good thing I get paid tomorrow

I asked before but didn't get a response. Does simply buying bitcoin (in any amount) with USD obligate me to do anything tax-wise? 
For example if I spend 20 a week on bitcoin... What do I have to do? I'm sorry, I'm 21 and uninformed. I only have 0.0055btc right now, and I just wanna know what I need to do to not piss off the government.

I installed electrun, wrote down my seed, set up 2FA, and made my password like 20char with unique characters/numbers/letter casing
Is that reasonably secure for me to breathe?
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:39:48
ELI5 SegWit / the relevance? Does it add more horsepower to the moon rockets? Best time to buy is now and second best time is after this?
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:32:22
Or just people that got in to bitcoin more recently and haven't experienced long term rises and falls first hand

A real baller would convert all their btc to fiat and send it to @_date: 2017-08-15 13:47:21
Ok so I'm pretty new, what exactly is the private key? Is it just information about the wallet or what? 
Also electrum uses 2FA with google authenticator, which is linked to my google account, which has 2FA through text. Theoretically if someone stole my phone and laptop and guessed my passcode for both then they could get to my wallet and attempt to send off my coins, authorize it on my phone, but they wouldnt have my wallet password and I dont think electrum will just show my seed information.

Bought one for my mom.
If you leave it plugged in overnight it destroys the battery
If you send them an email for a return they don't respond
Last I checked their website is down too
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:43:53
They bought it and keep it up now, not very well though
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:32:08
Congrats, I just hit 0.2!
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:26:43
I think I bought at like 3100. Only $25 worth, but got a good 0.007~ out of it.
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:52:33
Transferring coinbase to my local wallet cost $5 of the 20 I bought, is that a coolness thing or network thing?
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:20:35
That's why I bought ;)
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:43:12
Wizet did long ago, nexon bought it and now owns / develops it. Its a cash cow now
