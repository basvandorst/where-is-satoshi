You are going on the wrong track.

I believe whatever we have, we've created on our own. There's no thing like real capital. Money is money wether its physical or digital.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:18:16
Digital religion and gods? Sounds intresting.

Resource scarcity. The reason for WW3. I'm sure it will wipe out many nations. Smart people will migrate to bigger nations and fools will just become slaves.

For a second I thought You are saying "Uber Picked Bitcoin Finally"
@_date: 2017-08-27 15:20:08
That's absolutely correct and good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:06:30
That's cool
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:10:20
No. If there is a wallet, wipe your trezor and make a new one.

Use confirmtx.com
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:13:16
Use confirmtx.com and accelerate your unconfirmed transactions.

No doubt he's looking good now since he's going to be filthy rich now.

BTC + Bitcoin cash + Bitcoin gold + Bitcoin2x = Price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:47:59
My story lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:46:14
Altcoins are good.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:18:27
That's the issue buddy, it's not miners decision anymore. Big pools are making these decisions. Take BTC.com for example, they are charging 10$-100$ for acceleration lol while this site does the same job in 4$.

It's not complicated as suggested by other users. If you have sent Bitcoin to Bitcoin cash or vice versa you can recover your coins by importing private key of that address into your Bitcoin or Bitcoincash wallet. But if you will send wrong coins to any service or exchange, they might not give your coins back.

Glad it worked for you :)
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:22:09
If nobody pays the high fees then miners will mine almost empty blocks and still get the reward.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:01:25
Oh alright, it's a small size tx so free acceleration which takes some time, don't worry your text will confirm in a hour or two.

Thank you, It works :)

Scam. Do not use unocoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:50:20
Unocoin is a scam. Sunny Ray is the biggest looser who was involved in butterexchange scam.
