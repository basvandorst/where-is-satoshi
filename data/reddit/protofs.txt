Cost of living is pretty high in the major cities like Porto or Lisbon compared to the salaries. But I think you can live an nice life in other smaller cities.

Ledger Of Receipts, Returns And Issues
In 1080, William the Conquerer decided to build the Tower of London which has been used for different purposes over the centuries.
 
The Tower’s use became the headquarters of the Office of Ordnance (which provided military supplies and equipment) about 1660.
 
This ledger was discovered in 1914 and is a 914 page ledger which includes detailed lists of the items in the Armouries and Spanish Weapon house for the period between 21st june 1675 and 2nd September 1679.
 
I find it amazing on a few levels, like that it still exists and has not been eaten by bookworm or destroyed by mould, and that it appears to be still well supported in the spine, especially for a ridiculously large volume.
 
This is a truly massive book.

You can live in a small city with 15-20 k. Of course you won't save much. Nor have money to buy cripto eheh

In my view this happens because very few people use crypto in Portugal. But I think it is getting more popular among  young graduates. I've had classes about blockchain not long ago in a CS masters degree.
