Yes, it is time to cash out.  Buy more at peak of next bubble, sell again at lowest point after that.  Repeat.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:29:56
If so, they are going to be sorely disappointed.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:18:07
Uh... No it's just a guide to help you achieve your goals.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:53:38
but also I am better prepared for unemployment in the future or starting my own business?
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:14:42
This is completely wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:59:12
And your contribution is?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:39:19
So much vitriol!
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:59:17
people were still sending money to mtgox, hoping to purchase some cheap bitcoins, I assume.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:05:04
Didn't mtgox throw themselves and the whole bitcoin community under the bus?
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:10:19
Woudn't there be two transactions to the same address, for the exact same amount?
Edit: within a few hours of each other.

Somebody needs to make a flowchart of responses to all naysayer's lines of reasoning.
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:57:16
Trezor?  I swear I remember paying for one like 9 months ago...
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:06:05
I thoughts the protocols was the regulations
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:26:10
saving seems to be demonized a lot nowadays.
I always thought the ability to save for a rainy day was the difference between hunter gatherers and agrarians, but we seem to be moving away from it nowadays.
People seem to have a lot of opinions about what other people do with their bitcoins, it's a free market we can do what we want.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:36:32
Why did you ignore the crazy number of warnings over the last year and keep your bitcoins in one location, not under your control?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:00:08
Yeah, I did that by accident myself.  It should be okay though I threw the computer in the cat litter box.  I will get some sand to throw on top tomorrow.
In all seriousness though I have no idea what it can lead to.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:03:11
I would probably still eat, pay my power bill, drive to work, that sort of thing.
Might not buy a new tv or a pool, but is that really a bad thing?
Isn't saving what separates the hunter gatherers from the farmers?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:32:23
if the money was used to help rape children then you just get moved to another church.  
If reefer was involved, jail.

I never realized the US looked to China as a role model for guidance on it's laws and regulations.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:53:15
Are you high or just incredibly stupid?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:28:48
what is the approximate amount of time that it takes to "lawyer up" in op's locale?
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:21:20
I turn 100% of my pay into bitcoins, use credit card, pay my bills with bylls.com.  Whatever's left over by next payday goes to cold storage or silver.
Talk about incentive to spend less.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:59:27
yeah, and that price break only brings you down to 1.4%.  It is crazy.
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:22:03


You just described my mother in law.
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:54:41
cuz all the smart money launderers have people deposit cash into their personal bank accounts.
What crimes exactly would this stop?
@_date: 2014-02-22 18:10:21
10% would be 1.3 million, they don't have near that many.
If you are asking about the validity of the argument in the FUDicle I think this is fitting:
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:34:55
Because it won't work, also,
Streisand effect
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:10:31
Well maybe you should take a few years off bitcoin then.  Come back when out of beta.
@_date: 2014-02-22 02:39:43
your company is worth less in terms of btc, as the bitcoins are worth more.
I'm not really sure that borrowing with bitcoins will work, it seems like a really bad idea. (could you imagine if you got even a 2 year loan 2 years ago).
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:35:23
or since 2009
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:29:09
I'm all for the moon and all, but I think you may be getting a little bit ahead of yourself here.
All the bubbles seem to have a pretty typical shape, and it looks like we're just heading into despair here.  Maybe we are in it now, but this might just be capitulation.
Either way, bubbles typically have a few months of relative calm in the run up.
Edit: But what do I know really?  If I knew so much I would own a lot more of them.
