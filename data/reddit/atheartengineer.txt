Good luck!

But we neeeeeed to know lol

I like lydia, she seems like a cool chick. You should totally ask her out. Great fucking idea for a tinder question. Also, you should charge your phone.

Dollar cost averaging is probably the best move. Just put in a small amount every week, or every month
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:00:03
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:30:02
Right, but when he gets in office and starts acting like a dumbass...who knows
@_date: 2017-01-17 09:51:51
Could be the opposite... People invest in gold when they don't trust the market...After trump next week...They might trust in Bitcoin more
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:52:36
Haha accurate. The American government is now a reality TV show.
@_date: 2017-01-17 10:14:03
Theys yummy
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:30:27
yeah, maybe, we will see
@_date: 2017-01-17 09:50:58
I'm saying, I like bitcoin ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:24:45
I've been waiting over 24 hours...and I put in $17 for the transaction fee...yesterday.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:11:30
I’m gonna call stuff out as I see it regardless if I am being dismissed
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:11:29
If you are to busy to respond with helpful input, then don't respond. That's what I'm saying. You obviously have enough time to respond with remarks like this, so either put in a little more effort and don't act like an asshole, or don't respond at all. This big boy world doesn't have time for your shit, help or STFU.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:04:54
Jealous, don't worry...I'm catching up! I want a model X though.
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:54:30
No one is ever going to listen to you if you're an asshole. If you are going to put the effort into responding, maybe you should try to explain what you mean, otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time and being an asshole.

Coin alarm on Android, it's a little glitchy sometimes but it works, and you can add your wallet address and exchange API keys to view your total balance in the app. Don't get me wrong, it's far from perfect, but I've been using it for a few months now.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:55:59
Ya I would definitely be interested in an updated version of that.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:37:08
Immediately thought of that offspring song, made my hour, thanks haha
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:01:30
Yeah, you basically can set what points you want to be alerted at, one high one low. For example, you can set it at $5500 +/- 500, if it then goes below $5000 or above $6000 you will get alerted.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:05:33
I'm really glad the debit card thing exists, I think this will really help the transition.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:04:26
Ya I can't help you there, sorry.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:40:02
When we reach like $20k then probably, but for now...nope
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:54:16
Thats awesome, source?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:55:45
..only a few places away from taking the UK
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:05:01
Are we friends?
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:45:56
*very disrupt
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:36:26
Dollar cost averaging, best way to buy.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:53:41
Ya this isn't possible, this doesn't even make sense.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:53:55
@_date: 2017-07-01 03:55:24
I didn't say the intelligence community, I was implying Congress. Intelligence community is mostly us nerds, so I'm pretty sure they know what's up. However, Congress is pretty out of touch with technology...Hilary email scandal, Trump glued to his far out of date blackberry, most of Congress not understanding "the series of tubes", net neutrality...etc. 
As far as silk road goes, I'm actually impressed it lasted as long as it did. FBI put out a huge number of reqs a few years before silk road was shut down looking for "hackers". To bad they paid shit. 
I don't think Congress will try to shutdown Bitcoin, I think they would get a lot of backlash now, there is to much money in it. 5 years ago, maybe, now, unlikely.
@_date: 2017-07-27 21:45:32
Ya I looked at my old mining Bitcoin wallet...I'd earned nearly 18 bitcoins on it, only have a handful left and mostly spent it on dumb shit years ago. Holding for a while now.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:24:44
I'm a little lost right now too, trying to find YouTube videos on it now to figure out what is going on...
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:10:01
Ya exactly. Although fighting terrorism directly seems to be just as fruitless.
Part of that bill says that any transactions that "add up to" $10k can also be considered money laundering...wtf. So basically, it I make six figures and I pay a friend of mine to buy things for me (hypothetical) that could be considered money laundering because over let's say 2 years, that's over 10k.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:00:39
They don't understand how any of this works, they are just doing what they know how to do to try to control things they are scared of. If they weren't lazy, they would learn how bitcoin works and then pass laws that try to work WITH bitcoin, but they are to stupid to realize it is going to be very hard to stop.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:41:33
Like passing a law to consider bitcoin property was a good first step.
Allowing third parties to exchange bitcoin to USD on behalf of the IRS, or any federal agency, would be awesome. Paying taxes with bitcoin would be sweet, I could keep my whole paycheck for a little while. Right now there is risk of being accused of money laundering just for being an exchange.
Honestly, just the mentality of passing laws to control things is what I mainly have a problem with.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:04:45
Well that's why I said "allow third parties" to accept Bitcoin for the government. I don't see it as that far fetched.
@_date: 2017-06-15 08:47:07
Yes, to us, Bitcoin was already property. The reason it was good is because it is them acknowledging it's status, removing the ambiguity when it come to things like taxes, where the IRS or FBI could just assume the worst or assume whatever helps them at the time. Establishing a precedent by law gets everyone on the same page and legitimizes it more to members outside the Bitcoin community.
As far as them defining it inconsistently, yeah, they are fucking special.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:31:05
They should have incentive to work with bitcoin though, and they would if they did realize its unstoppable. I wish governments would start embracing technology more, they don't understand that technology is coming faster than ever, embrace it or fall away.
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:29:05
Can't wait
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:56:32
You are charged to move money though, which sucks.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:28:11
Ya, that is scary if that is true, they don't show their intelligence often though haha
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:05:28
They are gonna have a bad time then
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:30:43
Well technically before we went to a Fiat currency in the 70s I believe you could
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:12:12
Innovate our way out it, or let it all fall apart and start over.
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:25:21
Agreed, through a third party exchange it could be feasible though. Not trying to argue, I definitely see what you mean.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:09:36
Two quick points:
1. Shouldn't ever invest anything you aren't willing to lose. If you mined your coin, or if you are just buying what you are willing to lose, then I totally think its worth the risk.
2. "too early" to invest, that sounds like someone that will be kicking themselves down the road.
If it all falls apart and bitcoin goes to 0, then it was fun, but when it doesn't and that shit goes to $100,000, I'm retiring with 0 worries.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:27:18
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:28:50
I didn't miss the point, I'm just stating the reality of how it is right now, I'm looking forward to not having transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:57:45
Shes literally is impeding progress. I don't know how shes still in office.
*edit:forgot letter
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:06:57
Ya, that is what's scary. Society is supposed to be a combination of those currently alive, those dying, and those not yet born...those dying are being greedy and fucking us and our children.
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:25:14
What is gold if not all the same? They aren't mutually exclusive, your assumptions are wrong, and I think you calling me an idiot is pretty rude and ignorant. I'm trying to have a civil discussion and you are trying to judge character, you don't know me.
Gold is a monetary instrument, and property, and can be used as a currency. Gold coins literally have a market value, PCGS grades them and determines a fair market currency value for them. A gold brick, which used to back our currency, and still backs some currencies around the world, has a monetary value, is property, and is acknowledged as a currency.
If you have any facts against this I'd be happy to have a civil conversation about it, and I'm welcome to new information, I don't appreciate being called an idiot.
