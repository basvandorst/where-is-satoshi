They don't consider segwit a scaling technology though.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:39:21
They're not removing the EDA, just modifying it to avoid being gamed too hard.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:09:26
Short term profitability does not necessarily mean long term success. Either way this is all speculation on both sides. I've got my popcorn ready for the show.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:32:33
it sacrifices none of those things and opened many business cases back up because of the lower fees. Ultimately market will decide what works better.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:01:46
This isn't the first time the mem pool has filled because of low throughput, failure to learn and adapt is the reason the bch fork was done.
Good luck to you as well! Bitcoin will be stronger from this experience in one way or another :)
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:31:48
Which one has the features you care most about? Do your research. Nobody said the future would be easy or effortless.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:54:34
Seems to me like every bitcoin user had the same opportunity, and still do at the moment haha
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:58:03
How do you know it's spam? And even if it is, why can't the network process it? A weakness is a weakness, end of story.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:32:41
High fees are hard to swallow. Increasing profit also means reducing costs. At the moment bitcoin cash has the lower cost, which could mean higher business usage.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:21:15
Yeah, they have, no point denying it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:41:39
RAD! Well good luck either way. My advice is to find the features you care about and stick to them. If high fees impact you then maybe this isn't the coin for you
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:10:21
Obviously some demand for it. They have a whole community and a currently rising price.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:44:53
Lol, everyone who disagrees is a sock puppet, pathetic
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:48:19
It's not an attack, it's just a different roadmap. And for the record they're offering low fees and faster throughput.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:39:07
Let's not pretend that pumps and dumps don't happen to every coin including BTC. However even after a dump, it's still gained a lot of ground.
The market clearly does have some desire for bigger blocks, just shy of ethereum for now. But rising mempool and new difficulty adjustment in an hour and a half could shift things again. Either way, I've got my popcorn out for the show!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:44:47
So much for miners only following short term profit.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:51:45
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. SPAM will continue to happen until it's addressed. I don't see anything being addressed yet :/
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:24:14
Well said!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:27:21
The market does seem to care about high fees, otherwise we wouldn't have another fork to contend with.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:21:45
Don't feel bad for me, Roger has nothing to do with my choices. Bitcoin isn't about specific people.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:22:38
How can you tell it's pure spam hahaha? And it's still a weakness that nobody is addressing currently.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:03:54
In fact they do! They believe High fees means high value. Some of the more important figures in this system believe a $100 fee would be great. There's a tweet about it somewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:23:23
That won't be the end of it by far.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:36:16
It'll get there eventually. Unfortunately for you, you're competing with a lot of much higher fees and a ton of backlogged transactions. 
It's going down by ~10k a day so far.
This flooded mempool is exactly why BCH forked in the first place, we didn't want the backlog to get like this ever. Definitely read up on the differences between BTC and BCH and choose which features matter most to you.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:34:20
That was before we had competition, it's been years of not rushing it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:46:33
Bitcoin cash doesn't deny that on chain scaling isn't the final answer, they just aren't shying away from doing it to service the immediate need. Why turn down a bandaid when you're bleeding to death, just because their isn't a magic zapper that closes the wound in a millisecond.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:09:21
Gotta be careful treating bch like a threat here. Might get banned for not dismissing it's existence entirely.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:28:04
I think their respect was shown by implementing replay protection and tacking on of the word "cash". They believe that their coin is the real coin but they renamed it to remind people to spend it. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:10:49
Nailed it!
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:43:58
Yeah it's just the free market doing what free markets do.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:58:50
Sounds a lot like a belief to me ;)
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:40:11
You could also split the mnemonic with shamir's secret sharing algorithm. IanColeman made 2 kickass implementations that could be used to help you with this. 
 is specifically designed for shamir39 seeds. 
Rough idea is, you input your string, generate a number of new shares to give out to people or hide, and it takes a certain amount of them put together to rebuild the original string.
My system is similar to yours except I don't give the whole mnemonic to anyone, so no "trusted person" can steal from me without working with all the other shareholders.
If I die, my family/friends can claim the security deposit box and rebuild the mnemonic with their shares. 
If my device gets stolen, I simply make the rounds and collect the shares, rebuild the mnemonic.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:05:12
Yeah, because money with no utility is super valuable! We're coming for you banks!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:10:28
In about an hour that's gonna be a much closer number. We will lose some more hashrate.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:18:12
Except mining is open to everyone which is why so much of the hashrate has moved for now., so have fun with your theories ;)
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:21:07
XXX isn't trying to scale only on chain, they just disagree that block size increases are entirely bad. They're not averse to other scaling technologies.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:26:36
Yes a lot of people and businesses want bigger blocks to keep transaction fees small. Bigger blocks are not the only solution on the table, both bch and btc will investigate and test other solutions to make bitcoin as great as it can be. People say bigger blocks are just a bandaid, but sometimes a bandaid is needed if you don't have anything else to fix it with yet. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:14:33
Bch uses the original white paper from Satoshi, how do you know that core is more what he would have preferred?
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:20:16
How can bitcoin save the world economy if it cuts out people who can't afford a transaction fee above 1$ which is most of the world.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:35:13
Yeah for low fees you need to look elsewhere, maybe the other bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:55:15
Impossible to say. Free market will decide over time. Best thing to do is look at the roadmaps and decide which coin bests fits your use cases and ideal future, and invest in that.  However if you're asking about it in terms of pure investment and day trading then you'll probably want to look more towards the crypto markets subreddits.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:08:02
Shill harder ;) lel
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:55:15
Then why care about bitcoin core either?
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:29:36
Well said!
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:48:27
Who's to say that they're spam? And besides, if the network can't handle legitimate transactions(including 'spam'), then that's a real issue with no immediate solution on the roadmap. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:33:39
It's not an attack, it's miners following value just as intended by bitcoin. BCH simply gave their userbase something that core wouldn't so they forked and did it themselves. That's how bitcoin is supposed to work.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:06:49
Why on Earth would you want to??
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:40:44
Will do!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:40:34
It's going to keep happening thanks to the DAA they're implementing soon
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:25:49
Easiest place to start is coinbase, but they're going to want some identifying info. Good luck either way!
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:36:38
Seems better than PayPal to me, but that's just one mans opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:38:06
Wasn't faulty, worked exactly as intended. Some had to start mining just like Satoshi when bitcoin started. I don't imagine you ever bitched about all the coins he mined lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:31:07
Seems like you don't have a clue either, love seeing people speak for satoshi when nobody even knows who he is.
Mining is open to everyone, has been and will be.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:29:19
It's not an attack, it's just people putting their money where their mouth is. BTC will have core team, BCH will have their big blocks. Only time will tell where regular users and businesses continue to invest most. Hashpower is owned by miners, they can mine whatever they want, leaving is not an attack.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:33:11
Probably shouldn't call big blockers shit if you don't like the small block roadmap.
Have you seen the other roadmap?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:16:23
The same corruption that btc considered of they lost the s2x battle you mean ahhahahahah.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:07:57
Why on earth would you want this??
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:24:09
You keep using the word attack, I don't think it means what you think it means
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:22:59
I think there's another bitcoin out there for you!
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:39:57
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:18:25
Nailed it!
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:23:57
The more likely scenario is that they will continue to get higher. And it absolutely is a currency, that was the design from the beginning, it's just not functioning as an effective one yet.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:37:17
Just let them go their own way, big blockers have bch, core believers have btc, market will do what markets do. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:35:19
Rational behavior could push people to sell btc high, and invest in bch low, and then 10x their money in a flippening. Nothing is certain.
We're all just guessing what the market will do, nobody knows anything for sure. Gather the coins you believe the most in, and hope for the best. That or learn to dev and start contributing directly to the technology.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:28:36
Maybe look into a different bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:47:10
Damn, if only they didn't have a fork to fix that issue today.
