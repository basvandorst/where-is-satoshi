Roulette actually has one of the highest house advantages among the most popular casino games, even on single-zero wheels (most casinos on the Vegas strip now have double-zero wheels, which are significantly worse).
Blackjack (and most other 21-based games), Video Poker, the best bets at Craps, Baccarat, and Pai Gow are all far more favorable to the player than single-zero roulette by huge margins. Virtually all casino games are more favorable to the player than double-zero roulette.

If OP's statement read that bitcoin increased 200%, **then** dropped 66%, your point would be relevant.

He predicted BTC will reach $1M "someday". That doesn't seem outlandish to me at all. In fact, I think it's far more likely that BTC reaches $1M than drops to zero. Given the limited supply of BTC, if it ever reaches mass adoption (which it has slowly been creeping toward since its inception), a single coin would need to command a high price.
He only predicted a $5K BTC price by the end of this year, which seems fairly conservative, given that BTC has already topped $20K before.

I'm curious how you ship the units without damaging them. I have a few milk crate rigs, and while they're fairly sturdy (GPUs screwed into the plastic rim &amp; supported by PVC pipe), I wouldn't trust UPS or Fedex with them.
