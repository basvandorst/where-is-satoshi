[AEON]( also has pruning, you can run a pruned node with significant memory reduction considering it still allocate the db in ram:

This is not Satoshi either.
I have a feeling the real Satoshi got even further away with all of this...

pretty sure it would take more than 1 million bitcoins to defeat death.

Bitcoin and any decent cryptocurrency was made to allow decentralization through self-interest and greed of the individuals (you want coins you mine, buy or work for them) Bitcoin doesnt exist in a vacuum so people with current high purchasing power will always have a better start, Bitcoin wasn't made to end poverty or wars this is just another cruel myth like it being anonymous. Although satoshi was clearly against pools he wasn't against concentration of wealth, other coins are better when it comes to 1 cpu = 1 vote.

The same with Ed25519 but its a better curve, its the safest bet against the algorithm being mathematically broken or getting cracked.

Never thought I would say this but if true it makes Nicolas van Saberhagen extremely more likely to be Satoshi Nakamoto.
Just compare the notes:

Actually lots of people at the time and still to this day want Dorian to be Satoshi, now almost no one wants *this* Satoshi so it kinda helps the hoax version of the history more than the we found him version.
@_date: 2015-12-09 12:41:37
Eerie. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 12:48:36
if true I'm not surprised, thats what the real Satoshi would do, he would not shill for ethereum and would work for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:33:42
You should know nothing makes Bitcoin supremacists more pissed than a good, independent and **fundamentally** better altcoin that wound't blink if Bitcoin disappeared tomorrow.

Bitcoin cannot deliver, it is not really decentralized anymore, all your hash belong to Chinese ASICs, Monero is immune to ASICs, Bitcoin is not money because it is not fungible, no amount of denial can change that. Monero is decentralized electronic cash, Bitcoin is decentralized traceable token.

Welcome to reddit. Whoever you really are.

You can't deal with it with a permanently deflationary currency, Bitcoin ossifies wealth in the hand of few, forever. Why I'm a believer in tail-emission and disinflation.

You can't silence the truth forever.

I think they are behind hitBTC too, just who the hell are those ppl? CryptoNote is too sophisticated, its miles ahead of the Bitcoin protocol, we are not talking about low-life scammers here, the rabbit hole just keeps going deeper.
@_date: 2015-08-08 20:24:55
creepy Orwellian coin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:47:46
XMR, there are other cryptonote-based but Monero has the best momentum and team behind.
@_date: 2015-07-24 23:52:01
Its only an Orwellian-panopticonic currency that enables this kind of data.
@_date: 2015-08-21 07:22:10
I fail to see how Bitcoin or any crypto is like the Internet.

Just because you can make a payment network from a digital gold doesn't mean any digital gold (bitcoin) can work as a payment network, the way he implies is using off-chain solution which do not use blockchain at all, bitcoin won't work as payment network because it lacks fungibility and can't scale, it can work as digital gold if people start messing around including threating to hardfork war it to oblivion. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:02:40
moot point, we have monero.
@_date: 2015-09-26 18:07:18
Bitcoin can be digital gold but cannot be digital cash, but the technology already exist in Monero.

wrong, don't make things up.

logical fallacies all around.

I'm not following it very close, does it already works or its just some magical vaporware solution ?
@_date: 2015-09-27 01:02:57
Thats not how it works, bitcoin can be plenty of evil and Orwellian on its own without any bank using blockchains.

And dash/darkcoin (not to be confused with Dashcoin, a clone of Bytecoin and fully fungible cryptocurrency) is not really fungible since its a transparent blockchain (fork of Bitcoin) you can actually see how many coin are sitting on a determined address.
@_date: 2015-11-06 04:58:24
or other disinflationary coin like Monero, you can't have mining sustainability with deflation forever. OP is right.
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:43:48
You shouldn't even joke about this, I received this in the past as well and as obvious as it is, I have seen comments of people opening it thinking its legit and you know the result.
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:56:47
I don't get dem downvotes, if you want to be your own bank you should as well learn how secure your coins and this is impossible to really achieve with Windows.
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:30:15
You may want to look into dashcoin (**not** dash aka darkcoin the ancient scam), its a 1:1 clone of bytecoin.
ps: I personally think inflation is great specially if its low like Monero but hey to each its own.
@_date: 2015-10-13 18:33:44
There is a true DASH (Dashcoin), "DASH" aka Darkcoin stole the name and tried to shutdown the cryptonote alternative project, jokes on them tho, its alive and still kicking their instamined ass.

all that projection, I know playbook when I see one but using it against other coins just because Bitcoin is up a little sure is the epitome of hypocrisy, you probably have not been around the Monero project very much but Riccardo is one of the person I have the most respect in this space not because he leads my favorite coin but because of the integrity and commitment he displayed in the almost 1 year I'm watching, this cannot be taken away even if Monero tanked to 0 and those of us who are here not just to get rich but to watch what a truly revolutionary electronic-cash can do for mankind are very aware of that fact.
@_date: 2015-10-26 05:18:42
support Monero while there is time, if all there is in crypto is Bitcoin, 1984 will look like a walk in the park.
@_date: 2015-10-27 03:59:27
I'm not here to convince you, lets just say with Monero they can't be evil meanwhile with Bitcoin you wish they won't do evil.
