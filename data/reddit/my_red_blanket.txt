If and when you do this get it on Netflix
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:44:43
I'll never trust you.

It would be cool if people made donations to others who wanted to get fit. Get fit for Bit! Post video's of yourself completing various physical challenges and others could donate based on your transformations/acheivements!

I'm not sure. This is where the hivemind comes in...
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:23:31
control is an illusion ;)
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:42:51
Why doesn't stuff like this happen to me?
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:16:05
One day, I hope I can use any Bitcoins to help improve society in many different ways.
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:14:51
I don't normally go on the other websites. Simple as that why complicate it?
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:16:58
Jobs4Bitcoins should be changed to HireMe4Bitcoins
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:27:01
Can I be in it?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:06:03
I want to thank you, random.org, and the coffee gods. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:40:44

I'm about to give up on bitcoin. I can't really buy anything with it. It's too hard to actually get any significant amount bitcoin in your wallet without paying a fee to someone. The fee's for transactions are too high. It's just not worth the hassle.

Scare tactic. Everything is not what it seems. You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. EDIT: Posted the same thing twice because I couldn't find my last comment when I searched for it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:47:20
I feel the same way
@_date: 2013-04-22 01:59:11
Bitcoin is useless
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:16:17
I like you.
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:16:26
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:10:51
I wish I had friends that would tip me
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:08:52
Now put this into the context of the US dollar. Think about the past 100 years. Doesn't seem so crazy anymore does it?
EDIT: I challenge anyone to donate 1 dollar to me. At any point in the future I will pay you back 1 USD. Challenge accepted?
@_date: 2013-05-03 08:24:27
You know what I'm actually talking about, I have a feeling. And there isn't a way to do it.
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:07:42
I don't think I'd be able to make it. Insufficient funds. But I can dream. Maybe just put my name in the credits :p
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:10:58
up to .0304!
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:07:23
Definitely thinking outside the box haha I've always wanted to be on netflix!
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:47:39
My favorite thing is the happiness Bitcoin seems to bring people. It's truely amazing what one good idea can do.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:22:49
Go home. You're drunk.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:30:50
Did this really happen? I won't even make this much working for the next 2 weeks. FML.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:03:02
Edit 2: Message me your bitcoin address. If I don't pay you back the internet will call me out.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:00:57
Only siths deal in absolutes
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:20:23
Start to perceive Bitcoin differently
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:58:24
I would tip if I had some bitcoin
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:46:12
China is finaly crashing our economy! The Art of War. Maybe maybe not?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:30:30
I keep this tab constantly open
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:55:12
Ideas don't die
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:15:02
EDIT: Because of pop ups
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:50:22
Of course it would be you who shares my favorite thing about Bitcoin... lol
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:23:30
...And I still can't figure out how to get a bitcoin without a bank account
