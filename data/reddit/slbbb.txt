Who organizes Bitcoin? Your question makes sense just like this question. It's clearly organized, you can't answer with "who"
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:24:40
literally 99% of the online stores are using bitpay and your transaction confirmation time will expire?

When B1X is beating B2X - it's market decided. When money move out from BTC to BCH - it's an attack. Get your shits straight. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:24:29
why do you care about futures not backed by anything? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:45:57
Maybe you see it this way, but BCH is kind of an insurance. Are you 100% confident SegWit is the best possible solution to scale bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:26:50
Then maybe not use the market argument at all? It's complete none-sense to use it when it's good for you and tell it's rigged when it's not good for you.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:59:46
mempool is usually empty because people stopped using it. My sample is quite small - me and my friends, but all of us definitely use bitcoin at least 10x less because of the fees and no reliability to predict confirmation times
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:24:08
why the downvotes? I can run bitcoin node at a computer cheaper than the fees I payed for my last transaction
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:12:43
The only reason BCH survived is because it had emergency difficulty adjustment. That's not the case now. Only one will survive, the other will die. Or in worst case scenario (50/50) - both will be unusable for 2 or more weeks.

BCH bump is not temporary. Bitcoin just really splitted. Most B2X money are going into BCH. I will be surprised if we do not see BCH price at least at the level of the B2X futures

look at all this scaling and low fees! Meanwhile Litecoin has 4x more weight per minute and no one bats an eye. And people on are redirecting me to use Litecoin if I want low fees and low confirmation time
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:36:01

You don't need one. The split is real. It's just B2X money are moving out of BTC and flooding into BCH
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:40:36
Of course you will buy and hold. If you are a young person with no money you probably bought less bitcoins than the fee to get them out
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:40:15
That truly superior coin will be unusable for the next 12 months. At least that's the way I see it. The user base is growing. As result the tx backlog is growing and the fees are growing. I already make ~5x less transactions per month than I used to. I do not count a confirmation within 12 hours as 100% sure thing anymore. And there is no foreseeable adoption for resolving the problems in the next 12 months. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:16:51
I don't believe anyone holds bitcoins on an exchange with the idea it will be hacked. But it happens
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:35:08
Many clueless users stacking in exchanges is a recipe for disaster. Just my opinion
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:58:23
can you tell me the sense of Litecoin having 4x more weight per minute and Bitcoin having transaction fees costing close to running a node then?
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:06:54
But you will never see the [owners set] growing. New people will be stuck on exchanges because they will not be able to afford to move their money. You know, not everybody sells their house just to have enough money  to move their bitcoins out of exchanges.

Obviously spontaneous decentralized organizations are a thing. And obviously there is a goal (no 2x). And obviously it needs active actions.

newcomers cannot use it anyways. They are just stacking on exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:52:54
will you honestly make a purchase with bitcoin for less than 100$ with those fees?

fud is not even started. Just wait for the massive drop when people on margin are getting hit. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:08:18
Why do you think the unbacked futures will pump and not dump?
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:50:08
Most stores are calculating BTC price from USD. Bitpay sells the BTC for USD and it's critical they have the spender's BTC within relatively short time period, otherwise they need enormous buffer amount of BTC.
Same with Shapeshift and similar services. The short amount of time for confirmation is critical for such services, because otherwise they are exposing themselves to very big risk.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:14:36
You don't have to be "drama" to see it. The only people buying now are absolutely clueless or betting the two resulting chains will have bigger combined value. 
For the people downvoting me - I am just retelling what Charlie Lee and Jameson Lopp are saying
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:10:04
Why will you dump BCH at discount? You don't know how much BTC those people own. If they own more than 25% you will be dumping at big loss.

Indeed. Sorry for the panic mode. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:34:18
All I am saying is when the time for a Core promoted hardfork comes, and that time will come, this all thing will hugely backfire at us.  If I was a big miner that's what my strategy will be. I will leave the 1x chain without ability to hardfork ever. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:15:24
High transaction fees and 150000 tx backlog with 0 possibility for better situation in the next 12 months certainly are not helping. I started to make payments for 3+ months periods for the services I use because the risk of not being able to pay for days is now real and very high
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:40:35
Are you thinking those 200k new users daily are using Bitcoin, or they are just buying at Coinbase and hold at Coinbase. If 200k new users per day were using bitcoin the tx fee would likely be close to 100$. Enormous market correction is ahead. Too many clueless users are buying in now
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:08:43
Why do you think it's nonsense? I have never seen a single software solution in my life that is ultimate and flawless. Adopting one solution closes the door to other solutions, that's the case with the adoption of all tech solutions. 
Obviously all tx should be on chain solution is extreme nonsense, but believing adopting any scaling solution do not have tradeoffs is extreme nonsense too.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:11:18
There is a thing call minimum fee. I highly doubt miners will change it. So actually it depends on both

@_date: 2017-11-16 19:00:22
Yes, I got Bitcoins to switch to other cryptocurrencies based on Bitcoin. That's the advice I got on - just to use Litecoin. 4x more weight per minute, no one complaining
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:01:14
What will happen when there is a need for a softfork/hardfork for Schnorr or other update and miners simply refuse it? If they play the optimal strategy this is what will happen.
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:31:27

@_date: 2017-11-16 15:16:20

@_date: 2017-11-11 12:55:28
really? I am BCH fudster? Can you please check all my posts. 
Are you really not aware you can make money by dumping?
PS: I am thinking there are paid account here too advising people to sell at low price when it's clear what's going on. Wake up people, the current take over group have a lot of BTC, rely on people selling low BCH and buying BTC on margin and can take over BTC marketcap with extremely simple strategy
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:28:10
what store of value? The people who are buying now are not even withdrawing from exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:12:10
No matter how bad your day is, remember 58% of the BTC addresses have lower amount than the average fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:31:14
I withdrew all my holdings from exchanges at the time of the fork, but I can imagine people with less than 100$ in BTC on exchanges do not have the same luck as me because they had to pay 10% or more for fee

maybe those money were not going into Bitcoin. I know it's hard to believe. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:49:50
It is not old times, when the fees actually were massively indirectly subsidized by the coinbase transaction. Miners will not drop the default fee unless there is some crazy increase like 100x.
The formula to discover the price is quite simple. You need to maximize this:
(10^x * number_of_people_willing_to_pay) - cost
You can see it's not that easy do drop fees when the network is already grown, especially when you already have established X and  number_of_people_willing_to_pay is not growing fast when X drop because you already have clients.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:01:21
no emergency difficulty adjustment. It will not be like Bitcoin Cash. 1 survives, the other dies, or both crash for 2 or more week
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:53:45
Litecoin also has 4x more weight limit than Bitcoin. Yet I haven't seen a single person in the litecoin community complaining about 4x the weight makes it centralized 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:52:37
I can assure you the current BTC devs does now know anything about game theory. Or at least they do not act like they do in REAL life. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:54:09
I don't understand why people think UNBACKED futures will pump the price up. Money can be made both by pumping and dumping. Relying on a pump is the same as relying on a coinflip.

I use bitcoin at least 10 times less since the fees explored. My friends who used bitcoin frequently now use it once per 2-3 months. Telling "it's a spam" is simply ignoring what is going on.

again, mempool is empty because regular users stopped to use it. New users are not using it too, because it makes no sense to move less than 100$ out of exchanges anymore.
