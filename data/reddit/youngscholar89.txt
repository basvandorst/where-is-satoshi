I disagree. 
I think it can be perfectly reasonable to complain about someone not doing something, even if it isn't strictly required by law/code. Calling out bad actors for acting bad is perfectly reasonable (and no, not using SW doesn't automatically make you a bad actor). I would do the same if a miner started consequently mining nothing but the coinbase. Even if it isn't as elegant as code, social pressure/spreading awareness can be very helpful in progress.
There's an obvious and good reason that for not doing SW as a hard fork - and I'm sure you already know it.

I have, that's why I added the "no-coiners". 
Although I find it very weird, perhaps unhealthy to be deep in Blockchain scaling debates if you don't give a fuck about cryptocurrency. That'd seem like someone who just loved drama or were riddled with regret of not having bought in earlier and thus spend a lot of time trying to convince others (and perhaps themselves) that this thing won't work at all. Either way seems unproductive and unhealthy.

High school kids and degenerates. 
I think the phrase "life savings" without elaboration can be incredibly misleading as it can be two months of wages for a 20 y/o and a retirement fund with 40 years of diligent investment behind it for a 65 y/o.

Pretty scalable? Look at the fees on ETH over the last 6 months my dude. If anything ETH is proof that there are no magical solutions to scale on-chain and stay decentralized.
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:49:18


That's *nothing*. If all it takes to get Bcash to do an emergency hard fork is a few grand, they'll be doing *a lot* of hard forking if people actually start caring about it in a meaningful way.
@_date: 2018-01-15 23:46:50


Can you elaborate on this? Isn't funding a channel just sending an on-chain transaction to a specific address? (in a LN channel between Bob and Alice, one address would credit Bob's LN balance and the other would credit Alice's).


Makes a lot of sense, thanks.

I never claimed "talking about Bitcoin" without holding is wrong in any way. What I wrote is being obsessive in spreading these low effort "it's not gonna work, get out quick!" posts at the very least seems like a waste of time.

That they want to create demand for the asicboost compatible coin that they're holding a ton of after mining a crazy amount of them early due to the shitty EDA?
Even removing the asicboost and "lol bcash" stuff, it makes perfect sense for Bitmain to try to make their hardware less reliant on a single network. I think this is evident in Jihan constantly saying stuff like "Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash". He wants there to be more coins with actual markets using the SHA256 algorithm as to lessen the risks of him being stuck with bricked hardware and production line.
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:45:29
A little favoritism? Dude has purposely been delaying/downprioritizing scaling Bitcoin because his preferred scaling approach didn't "win". This at the cost of all of his customers (who buy Bitcoin) and everyone using the network.
It's fine that he doesn't want to implement SegWit, but then he doesn't get to complain about Bitcoin failing to scale or Bitcoin Core holding it back. He also doesn't get to say bullshit like "it's not something our customers really want" without being called out on it.
I wouldn't care if he was a public Ethereum maximalist but describing the tweet above as "a little favoritism" is baffling to me.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:45:19
The guys that are complaining about that while not supporting:
* Support SegWit adoption
* LN testing and development
* Development/research in things like Schnorr signatures, MAST and sidechains 
**Are big ol' fat phonies.**
It's like the same exact pattern in almost every positive/neutral thread on r/Bitcoin these days. There will be some random generally comment at the top, then some totally unrelated **extremely** shortsighted commenter will highjack it with the "LOL fees" or "Bitcoin is dying, cash out while you can!" narrative and quickly get upvoted heavily.
This one is spectacularly stupid in that it argues that because current on-chain capacity isn't enough for world wide adoption, Bitcoin could never scale. What a fucking non-starter. 
Although I'm not normally quick to delve into conspiracies I find it hard to believe that there isn't some sort of no-coiner, butt-coiner or alt-coiner brigade going on in this subreddit. I mean there are way more creative and convincing things from their FUD playbook than this, very weird how these low effort fearmongering comments suddenly became popular.

If they simply adopted SW they would increase throughput on-chain, just like a block size increase and buy everyone time for second layers. This **without** a guaranteed disruptive, non-replay protected hard fork.

@_date: 2018-01-19 11:33:24
LN does not fix Bitcoin scaling for all eternity. No one thing could possibly do that.
If you think on-chain throughput will forever be pegged to 4 tx/s, you have not been following development very thoroughly. SW, Schnorr signatures and MAST are all on-chain throughput increases that has been or is likely to be implemented by soft forks.
LN should give us A LOT of runway to improve scalability before hundreds of millions of people even wants to use Bitcoin.

It wasn't supposed to be mandatory just like mining transactions in blocks aren't mandatory. 
You can still call out large players who purposely, negatively impact the network. Especially when those same players have history of complaining about the very thing they are causing.

@_date: 2018-01-22 14:53:51
Yea, I only read the footnotes in the comment I replied to and the title and wrongly interpreted it as them not seeing SoV as interesting in terms of increasing the value of the network. I appreciate the elaboration.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:35:29
I'd rather hold a temporaribly "unusable" currency (for small value transfers), than something much less secure and less certain in the long run.
If you expect creation and adoption of a real alternative to state-issued money will not be attacked from all angles possible going, you haven't been paying attention. Cheap transactions are a nice but if it risking the long term viability of the network for the convenience of a few early adopters and businesses is, in my opinion, ridiculous.
Bitcoin is trying to become sound money. Sound money is *way* more exciting than a frictionless medium of exchange and if you have a modicum of patience, you may just get that as well.

@_date: 2018-01-21 20:05:55
Yup, I see LN making the risk incurred by traders way smaller as the cost and time of transfer to/from exchanges to private wallets almost dissapears thus making the amount of time needed to store Bitcoin on exchanges a lot shorter. Obviously, this will take a while before it's viable, especially for bigger traders.
LN should also be great for arbitrage between exchanges that take LN deposits, in theory they should all trade at the same price at that point. Exciting times ahead.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:06:20
You can't be a decentralized currency without being decentralized first. Once the base layer is no longer sufficiently decentralized ANYTHING you build on top of it will be the same.


Decentralization is a spectrum, "truly decentralized" is not some objective definition. I for one do hope that Bitcoin can manage to stay as decentralized as now or more while being able to handle orders of magnitude more throughput off and on chain.

The utility of LN will rise as people and businesses adopt it, however as long as some businesses, service providers or individuals that you want to transact with uses it, it will have utility for you.
Obviously, ANY network has to start with no users and thus is inherently useless.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:42:51


Isn't this quite contradictory? They cite it as being the **least** interesting use case, then they go on to elaborate on how stores of value that are far less nimble and resistant to seizure have many trillions of USD in value.
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:26:21
I'm not sure how better fiat exchange would make it possible to earn an ROI on your Bitcoin. AFAIK the only way you can do so is by lending and unlike having a LN node, I'm not sure if that is possible without counterparty risk (it surely isn't now).
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:13:46
Perhaps you wouldn't have "insane" fees on-chain if a lot of transactions moved off-chain. And no, it isn't broken at all, it's just bad a a payment system at the moment.

Can you find anything available for non-founders or VC funds offered to provide series A funding that has seen similar returns? I doubt there you can even find VC funds that has seen this sort of ROI. 
We're talking hundreds of millions of percent since early 2010 when you could buy 10,000 BTC @ $50.
Apologies if I'm coming across like an overly confrontational Bitcoin “white knight” - that is not my intention. This is something I've been genuinely curious of and so far, I’ve failed to find any (even anecdotal) evidence of similarly performing investment opportunities. I’d love to see other comparable (or even better) historical cases.

That sucks. Where are you from?
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:28:52
Lmao, if you think LN is the end-all-be-all solution you're misinformed greatly.
There are many solutions currently being worked on to improve throughput both off and on-chain. LN is just a very promising one of the bunch.
GTFO with your fearmongering bullshit, go support the something you believe in instead.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:04:47
It was almost as if the internet of 1992 wasn't very useful for 4K video streaming too.
Bitcoin is scaling, just not currently fast enough to meet the exploding demand, thus some use cases are impractical for now. If you think the innovation with Bitcoin was cheap and fast transactions, you haven't dug deep enough.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:16:37
I'm not too worried about that. It is clear that people value Bitcoin despite it not being useful for small transaction, at least for a period. There are obvious trade-offs with faster block times and larger block sizes. A lot of the people that were constantly screaming about fees destroying Bitcoin have already moved on to more centralized, cheaper alternatives.
It is clear that a block size increase is highly contentious at this point in time and would cause a network split. So ironically, I doubt the fork with higher on-chain throughput would need that capacity at all.
Bitcoin is amazing, even if it can't live up to every promise made in the early days by some, for everyone in the world from day one. The amount of progress we've seen since SW activation and the scaling dead lock ending, have been incredible in my opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:59:00
You are putting words into my mouth. I never claimed it recently shifted. It just lost some utility but only periodically and not it's most important one.
I don't think anything will replace it as SoV simply because for a lot of people to store value in a network there has to be a high degree of trust in it. This trust takes time to build up and if anything replaces that function, that new thing will hardly be a good SoV with a lot of trust since it has already been proven that one of these "artificially" digital scarce commodities can be replaced entirely. I doubt people will be truly comfortable holding whatever overtakes Bitcoin as a SoV since it will always be in the back of their heads that some new shiny tech could come and replace it easily.
Sure, anything is possible - the world is a chaotic place, I'm not arguing there is 0% chance of Bitcoin becomming all I think it will, that would be silly. I'm just think the likelyhood is high enough that I am comfortable betting on it.


Not sure if you're genuinly curious or just trying to accuse me of shilling. Giving you the benefit of the doubt I'll answer. I have no pricepoints set that I want to sell at, I have a lot of faith in the longevity of Bitcoin and only plan on spending or selling in order to cover expenses (not to have fiat money lying around).
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:12:27
It is not exactly the same way. The major important difference is that there is no risk of it turning into a fractional reserve system over time. Something that I would wager is almost inevitable with a gold standard.

@_date: 2018-01-08 23:31:42
An early contender to worst analogy of the year right there. 
If you think there is a problem with it being uneconomical to send small transactions with Bitcoin, this is a solution. It might not be the only solution for all of time, but it certainly is one that could open up specific usecases again.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:25:10
Nope, the LN being developed for Bitcon needs SegWit. Last time I checked Bcash was spreading misinformation about how SegWit destroyes the Bitcoin that was "Satoshi's vision".

Yea, it's not that I don't want to be able to buy coffee with Bitcoin, it's just that it's not my main priority. Being able to opt out of fiat entirely would be awesome (obviously still unrealistic for basically everyone) and the ability to do smaller transactions that makes sense economically would be a step in that direction.
I'm confident I'll be able to buy myself an off-chain macchiato soon enough and I look forward to that day.

@_date: 2018-01-07 22:15:22
The network would split into two as it is impossible to force nodes to run the new version of the software with different consensus rules.
So unless you got basically everyone to change (which is clearly impossible given the last year of debate/fork drama) you would just end up with a disrupted network, yet another fork of Bitcoin and probably a lot more people losing money since it would not have replay protection.

IANAL but from what I've heard there shouldn't be a legal issue of doing "money transfer" on LN as a routing node since there is no real custody of the funds being transferred.
It's obviously not always clear-cut with law and could be different depending on jurisdiction and exchanges might even opt out if they fear there is a risk that it could be interpreted differently or changed in the future.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:47:31

So, the Bitcoin strategy? I didn't think that was what Bcash users signed up for.


So just because I'm not willing to spend $10k disrupting the network, that somehow proves my argument that $10k is absolutely nothing in the context of disrupting something trying to be immutable money. The lack of foresight displayed here is almost scary.
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:56:08
Yea, how come they keep bringing up LN? How does that have any relevance to transaction costs, times and scaling?
Crazy people all over, amirite?
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:46:56
Where would all this capital go exactly? LN nodes with low fees will probably be hosted by people who would've otherwise held on to the Bitcoin long term that are incentivized to help make it a better medium of exchange. 
I think the "locking up" of coins is a completely wrong way of thinking about it. Having Bitcoin on layer two it likely to become "more unlocked".
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:34:25
I know this is still far from being BIP-ready but watching the amount of progress on base protocol development and second layers is truly amazing.

It takes time indeed, but I think there are lots of smaller businesses who have taken Bitcoin payments earlier that would love nothing more than to do so again. They will have a ton of incentive to get a LN node running ASAP to get the exposure to Bitcoiners back and the ease/safety that comes with dealing in BTC.
So a few of those coupled with a bunch of enthusiasts eager to try out mainnet lightning transactions (I can't fucking wait) will make for some lucrative businesses. Other than potentially being lucrative, it's also a pretty damn cool thing to be able to say you were the first shop of your kind to take LN txs, nice free advertisement.
I'll probably be buying some shit I don't want just to try this thing out.
Reasons like this is why I think LN will make for faster adoption or at least faster benefit to adopters than SW. The guys dragging their heels on LN basically has no effect on the people using it (once they are off-chain) with SW, although you do get the benefit of cheaper txs, if noone else is using it and blockspace is in high demand, fees will be high regardless.
@_date: 2018-01-20 10:41:27
I never denied anything, I don't even give a damn about reddit to be frank. Just like I don't spend all my day complaining about Bitcoin.com articles spreading bullshit.
What I'm saying is that if you want to build the future of money, you don't do it by analyzing post and moderation history of mods and devs. I would much rather spend time educating myself on and using the real groudbreaking technology that is being built in front of me than reading novella-length posts detailing drama and conspiracy theories.

I agree that comparing an asset like Bitcoin with a shares of a company in terms of market cap makes little sense. However, comparing the returns that have been available through some of the most lucrative investments available to normal people, does make sense.
You could argue that no "normal people" knew about Bitcoin in 2010 but even if we took something more reasonable like mid 2013, the results are similar and his point remains valid.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:01:28
It's a lot safer than any alternatives. Mining centralization is of course a worry. But if SW2X proved anything, it was that the protocol is extremely hard to coopt.

LN effectively functions like Bitcoin, you decide how much you want to send and who you want to send it to. There are no chargebacks, if you send too much you will have to rely on the receiver being honest and repaying you.

That just doesn't make much sense to me. Bitcoin is a new and in some respects much better and more convenient way to fulfill the same use case. If it could attract just a fraction of that value it would have an enourmous impact on mkt. cap.

This is only true if you think cheap transactions has more utility than a secure, censorship-resistant store of value. In which case Bitcoins utility has increased A LOT over the last year. Hash rate has gone up crazily and it has proven resistant to various attacks.

Acting like you are entitled to cheap immutible transactions was what made me feel like you misunderstood Bitcoin. It's open-source, if you disagree with how the network is scaling you are free to fork the code or use more centralized alternatives. 
I know it sucks to pay huge fees but scaling the network should in my opinion prioritize the long term viability, and I believe that is what is currently being done.

Why are you so certain that functioning well as a currency is what drives value?

SegWit is literally simpler than pushing a button for the end user, it's just a different address format. Users aren't holding back adoption, given the option I will bet you that 99% would choose a cheaper transaction with no downside to them. The only issue is that the service providers (exchanges and wallets etc.) has yet to implement the option.
They may not have been punished for doing so yet, but long term they WILL have a distinct disadvantage if they hold out and either lose out on market share or revenue (in all likelihood both).
I think your line of thinking is a bit impatient and short sighted, it is reminiscent of the "SW will never get 95% mine support, so let's do something else instead" arguments we heard from various people earlier this year.

Bitcoin solved an important problem in computer science, lotteries didn't.

However, if you did and was smart enough to understand how it worked and why it had enourmous potential, then you deserve more credit than some guy who went all in on powerball tickets and won.

I have no idea.
It seems logical to me that the people who prioritize low fees short term over centralization would've jumped to an altcoin long ago (Bcash was just the latest oppotunity to do so). I think a lot of people whining about fees and block size have left Bitcoin already and are only trying to recruit new people to their project. Sure, there are Bitcoiners that would like to see a blocksize increase but if there is not broad consensus forking makes little sense as it would only create another altcoin.
Bitcoin is an open source project, anyone who disagrees with developement are free to fork the code.

Nope, and neither is it now. In fact effective throughput has never been higher than it is today (not even before the 1MB cap).


That would leave you with another minority altcoin, but at least you could consolidate your UTXOs there more easily.


I'm sorry to hear it but this should not dictate how sound money is being built, hopefully people will get another chance to consolidate sooner rather than later, there have been plenty in the last 3 months (even the start of this month).


Yes, more centralized payment methods will be better for small/medium transactions while we're in this phase of scaling Bitcoin.
If I was you I'd be arguing for SW adoption, switching to service providers that utilize it. This is the only realistic scaling measure we have right now that will not split the network.

Get your retarded Blockstream conspiracies back to please. If there was a centralized party controlling Bitcoin, let's call it "Blockstream Core", then we'd have had SegWit more than a year ago. The "downside" to decentralization is that consensus can be hard to reach, thankfully for you Bcash doesn't have that issue.

Trust that it will exist tomorrow. The Bitcoin network has proven incredibly resilient to takeover attempts and attack at the consensus level. Like any asset, expectations of the future is a huge driver in price discovery.

It's not the job of the Bitcoin protocol to be easy for end users to adopt. That task falls on service providers building exchanges and wallets. There's a very good reason that SegWit is not mandatory.

@_date: 2017-12-26 15:10:36
I think it's important to not label any transactions lower than X sats/byte as spam, there is nothing wrong with trying to get super low-priority transactions through. However, due to how cheap it is to do a lot of super low fee transactions, the fee-situation should never be described as good/bad based on the size of the mempool alone.
When I say, "spam attack" I'm referring to malicious spam. A general definition would be transactions that are made with the sole purpose of increasing fees/slowing down transactions.
It can be very to identify these transactions but generally moving the same coins around, consolidating and splitting up UTXOs. Even though they can be hard to identify malicious spam from them for sure, it makes sense that someone wanting to disrupt Bitcoin and push their own low-fee alternative would do so when making a push.
Bitcoin is the big dog, it will always be attacked like this, even if we had twice the size blocks the very same attacks would take place. The only difference is that driving up the fees to the same levels would be more expensive, however I'm sure they'd make the same arguments even at lower fee levels. Therefore, we shouldn't respond with panicked hard forks, that is exactly what would disrupt our network and leave us more vulnerable of losing the  spot.
I like that Bitcoin is developed with a long-term focus on making the best censorship resistant p2p money as possible, it will move forward and disregard all the noise. Certain business models and use cases being priced out for the time being is regrettable, but we should not let overpromises of the early days when little was known about scaling decentralized blockchains compromise the project.

While there is certainly some truth to your advice the craps table analogy is terrible. Casino games have a provable negative expected value, holding Bitcoin (while still being risky) does not.
I also wouldn't recommend setting stop limit orders as that would entail leaving money on exchanges.

@_date: 2017-12-26 01:20:06
They don't really do so though. Perhaps *some* harder to get version of the Skydweller or Daytona but after services you're gonna be at a loss almost all new Rolex watches bought today. With expensive watches services can become very pricy and if you can't document proper servicing the resale value takes a hit. This effectively makes them not only non-productive assets (like Bitcoin, ignoring forks) but "unproductive" assets.
I do enjoy nice mechanical watches but I don't pretend they generally make for good investments. Of course, like with anything there will always be a few exceptions.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:31:13
Driving fees up with malicious spam could actually be profitable for large miners. By flooding the current fee level or the one below it with txs to exploit fee calculation in wallets and people in a hurry to get their tx through. This can be somewhat mitigated by further miner decentralization, although cartels will always be possible.
I also think there is now enough money in this space that large non-miners could perfectly well afford doing it briefly, doing while pushing their project. It could of course be a coincidence but there has been a lot of things coinciding with recent peaks in the mempool. Seeing it suddenly start going up rapidly just prior to a difficulty adjustment, followed by a big marketing push from altcoiners seems like a bit of a pattern. There have been quite a few violent changes to the mempool that makes me feel confident it's not being used as a tool to try to influence development or acquire users.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:10:18
I don't see how this is an actual cost to any long term holders that know how to secure their coins. I don't think there will be a lack of people who have plenty of coins that would otherwise just sit in cold storage that will use a small amount of those to fund a LN node. I don't see how these people would "use their coins" alternatively.
If LN is even a slight success, the value of their coins (both the ones "locked up" in LN and the ones sitting on the "unlocked" on the main chain) should go up.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:32:34
Had to google that and Perhaps I'm on the male-rag ;)
I'm just tired of the short term focused fear mongerers shouting "think of the fees and poor people!" when their "solution" is obviously not viable long term or realistic short term. Since they offer no real solutions, it ends up being noise from people that feel entitled to cheap transactions becasuse they have a fundemental misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is.
No, "Let's split the network again, but this time in a more disruptive manner!" is not a good solution.

I'm a huge fan of Schnorr signatures, implementation at some point is really a no-brainer. 
However, I fail to see how it can help solve malicious spam (spam transactions designed to take up block space and increase fee levels). From the article:


Since it will realistically only be implemented as soft-fork it will not be mandatory and thus bad actors would still be able to spam the mempool with the exact same txs they do now. 
It is addressed in this paragraph:


Obviously, "good actors" switching to Schnorr sigs would free up block space at given levels of throughput, but by this argument SegWit is just as much of a help with making spam more expensive. And I'm not sure I'd say a spam attack would necessarily be more expensive. 
The fees would obviously find a lower equilibrium BUT increasing them by X% would not be guaranteed to be more expensive. Raising median fees in sats/byte to a certain level would be more expensive, but only if demand for blockspace doesn't organically increase to take up this new throughput.
Am I missing something? Care to elaborate @_date: 2017-12-05 13:57:02

Sure, but as they come with a ton of risk we should not simply HF because we want to change 1 variable of the consensus code. Hard forking on short-notice should only be done in absolute catastrophes (huge security issue), things where it is obvious that there is broad consensus, a block size increase is simple not one of those things at this point.
The fact that a hard fork is likely inevitable at some point in the future if we want worldwide adoption is not a good argument for doing a contentious one tomorrow.

Yea, for this reason, moving on to service providers who are more technically capable and willing to do the work required to keep lower fees transactions viable is more important.
This cycle will continue if we don't punish the businesses draggging their heels by switching to competitors, the same is bound to happen with Schnorr signatures and LN adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:36:28
I only really think that would be an issue for merchants doing low frequency, high value sales, in which case fees guaranteeing next block would not be a big problem.
For those receiving many small txs the volatility should somewhat even out. On LN I see this happening even less often and I still don't think it's a huge risk. Settlement could be done daily or every four hours. Some intervals the price might drop resulting in loss of revenue but the intervals where it goes up should make up for this in the long term. Also, while Bitcoin is small and volatile, many businesses will likely only receive a small amount of sales in BTC and the majority in "low risk" fiat. 
 It could even be stipulated that swings over X% can before X confirmations (enough to get them exchanged to fiat) would be cause for resettlement. 
This can probably also be insured for rather cheaply, I'm not sure how Bitpay works but I would not be surprised if they already had or at some point add merchant guarentee of the exchange rate at a small premium (a few basis points would probably be profitable for them given a large amount of somewhat evenly distributed txs daily). 
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:03:19
What a fantastic insight.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:28:35
Acceptable is obviously way too ambiguous for that to be answered. However, it would certainly lower the possible median fee level to few (10-30 would be my guess) sats/byte at current throughout demand.
The issue is that anyone will still be able to spam the blockchain in order to raise fees to disrupt Bitcoin or campaign for their low fee alternative. This is true with a block size increase as well. The lower the fee level the cheaper raising it by 100% becomes. 
Schnorr signatures is a much more interesting solution to malicious spam attacks, as they make doing so more expensive.

Partially correct, perhaps because they see that second layers is the only way to scale Bitcoin to global use without destroying the foundation of immutability and trustlessness.


Nope, they are (as opposed to the bulk of other companies in this space) doing an incredible amount to help development and have done so for years. I think anyone holding $15k BTC owes them gratitude.


Sure, miner centralization is a legitimate worry, I'm hopeful it is becomming better and will continue to do so as more new ASIC producers ramp up production.

I disagree that the consensus model failed. We just learned that it isn't miner democracy. What did fail was the technical abilities of the large service providers.

I think this was an important victory for Bitcoin, it makes me confident that no one will be able to coopt the protocol and change something like the coin cap/inflation rate in the future. The "soundness" of this sound money is intact and proven to be resilient - building it out on top is next. And they are far beyond "untested beta code".

I don't have a number but with SW adoption **and** a 2x increase I think we'd both see a substantial stagnation in new nodes being brought on as well as old ones dropping off. It also just sets a bad precedent for easy, less sustainable solutions and will obviously lead to a damaging network split.
It's not too expensive to spam bitcoin for a bit to get very high fee levels (especially not for miners), if we started caving and forking every time this happened, not only would we destroy the network effect (by the fork likely being a minority of users/value), we'd also risk furthering miner centralization which seems to me to be one of the bigger concerns atm.
Scaling with backwards compatible protocol upgrades and second layer solutions is the only thing that makes sense at this point in my opinion. This is not to say there can never be a block size increase via hard fork, but it's obvious that a large amount of users and devs will not do it now. We have yet to even see the real benefit of our blocksize increase with SegWit, this is **not** because the users don't want it (as many try to spin it), but rather that the users aren't offered it on most of the large service providers at the moment. High switching costs and a low level of education delays this process, but IMO it is bound to reach wide adoption no matter if a few large hold-outs keep digging their heels in.
I am of the opinion that Bitcoin is extremely valuable and has the potential to change the world in major ways, however if ran by a Silicon Valley start up that is only concerned about scaling to meet user demand, it will almost certainly fail being what it could become in the long run.

Yea, deal breaker. Let's stop trying to develop second layers.




On-chain scaling solutions and other off-chain ones are currently being worked on as well, LN is not the end-all-be-all solution, it's just a very promising one.


*Sigh* if you think a block size increase that will basically guarantee another minority altcoin (in a way more disruptive manner if done with replay protection) is a good idea then I'm not sure what to tell you. After BCH and the SW2X disaster I think it should be clear to everyone that a large amount of the users and devs are not in favor of a reactionary hard block size increase (that will by no means be a one-time sustainable solution and will come with significant drawbacks). Anyone is free to fork off, of course - but doing so now given the last few months just seems retarded.

True for any non-productive asset.
Bitcoin will never get above being "speculative" since there is no underlying cash flow to make calculations based on. I think access to unseizable wealth is incredibly valuable and while we may be a bit overextended in the short term, I think we're just getting started.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:59:42
I disagree with your premise that less secure, more centralized alternatives are arguably better. Sure, they are different, and you might prefer them, but I personally don’t find them nearly as interesting long term.


It would almost certainly create a minority altcoin with no real developer support and come with the cost of a lot of disruption to the network. Why? Because a large number of users and developers disagree with a reactionary, hard block size increase being a good option at this point. 
If you want to know why they disagree with that I can recommend giving [THIS]( podcast where Marty Bent speaks with John Newbery (Bitcoin Core contributor working for Chaincode Labs), I think he does a good job presenting the longer-term approach that I think many "small blockers" have.
If your response to this is "Blockstream Core" controls Bitcoin and is trying to destroy it on behalf of banks, I have no interest in continuing this argument as doing so would most certainly be a complete waste of both of our time.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:26:03
Right, I can agree with that. Similarly, any blockchain based project that want to scale worldwide needs second layers. The main difference of how I see it compared to some big-block proponents is that I don't think that short term fee levels should be what decides *how* we scale.
I also think we could easily get median fee levels significantly below 100 sats/byte with current throughput demand when major service providers adopts SW and tx batching **or** service providers that do take over meaningful market share. And I'm a lot more optimistic that this will happen and sooner than many seem to think. The only issue is that, like a block size increase, spam can will always be able to increase fee levels. It does become more expensive as on-chain throughput increases, but it obviously becomes cheaper as fees decreases (to raise the fee level by X%).
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:02:43
Perhaps, on the flip side it won't take many large players for this thing to quickly go up dramatically.

I'm glad to hear you don't subscribe to that bullshit. I didn't mean to accuse you of it I just wanted to know if I was wasting my time here or not. 
This stuff has been explained ad nauseam. If you want a thorough breakdown of the situation I can recommend this medium post made in opposition to the SW2X movement. It highlighst the implications using hard block size increases as scaling measure has on UTXO set growth and degree of trust involved in the system:
People that make this out to be a simple solution with little risk are often doing so based on a layman's understanding of the technology, many emotionally skewed by their desire for cheaper fees short term. 
They write off the opinions of real experts on the subject like Nick Szabo and Adam Back on the premise of them being compromised by bankers. Which is hilarious if you know their history. Like securing a nuclear power plant you should probably value the advice of engineers over that of the average person.
If you want to get a real sense of the "small block" sentiment, I think listening to [THIS]( podcast with John Newbery (An active core contributor working for Chaincode Labs) is a fantastic start. At least I consider it a good summary of the reason many Bitcoiners and devs approach scaling the way we do.

@_date: 2017-12-31 06:17:33
If you think hard forking a network like Bitcoin back and forth between block sizes is risk free you have not been paying attention. It would basically guarantee a network split when forking one way and likely one more when forking back.
At some point in the future it could happen but for now we have to accept that it is highly contentious and will likely continue to be so until we see the effects of stuff like SW, LN, Schnorr sigs and MAST.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:20:43


The fact that you refuse to believe that trustless, unseizable digital store of value is not real funcitonality is frustrating.
SoV != stable price. Fiat money is a terrible store of value even though it's very stable. Real estate is generally a good store of value even though it can fluctuate wildly. Bitcoin has similar properties to other historically good stores of value, such as gold or land.


I agree. I just don't think I'm expecting the same outcome as you.

@_date: 2017-12-29 15:54:39
Using a "two level" HW wallet is IMO the best option. 
This is possible on Ledger (probably other HW wallets too). Basically it enables you to first login to one set of wallets (that only has a tiny fraction of your total holdings) and then with another password get into the real thing.
There is no way for a thief to tell that you haven't just unlocked the entirety of your cold storage and so a he should be less inclined to beat you up or even torture you than he would if you conveniently "forgot" your HW wallet pincode in the situation. I also think you are more likely to escape unscathed (other than the value of the wallet you unlocked) than with multi sig wallets since the thief actually gets *something* and thus is more likely to just try to get away with the profits than to stick around. Setting 1% of your BTC aside as "mug insurance" seems like a decent trade-off.
Of course, never being public about how many BTC you have or even how early you get involved is also a solid as a way to prevent these situations.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:17:12
I don't buy into the articles/FUD claiming LN is centralized vaporware just like I don't buy into it being the end-all-be-all of Bitcoin scaling. Of course, terribly centralized but we'd have to see how the actual network topology develops instead of sitting around claiming our guesses as fact. What it does not do, guaranteed is further centralize the base layer.
LN is opt-in, bigger blocks isn't. If you haven't noticed that's a big priority when it comes to upgrading Bitcoin. LN is not even close to the only scaling solution being worked on right now, it's just a very promising one that has come a long way since SW was implemented. It might solve everything, but falling short of that still leaves room for it to be an enormous success.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:23:47
We do have a solution for short term problems, it's called SW and would clear the mempool rather quickly at current throughput demand.
A contentious hard fork is not a solution, it's another network split that will almost certainly leave you with a minority altcoin with terrible developer support.
Andreas thinks that we will increase the block size at some point, I think most Bitcoin Core contributors agree. I also think most agree that doing so now is a terrible "solution".

How is it irrelevant? You want price to equal utility, yet seem to only consider transactions as utility.
I agree, blockchain technology is merely "interesting" in most potential application. However, it's clear to me that it has one killer-app: money. 
And no, this does not imply that every transaction in the world gets put on the public immutable ledger, for all of eternity.

Where did I imply you said that? I was just trying to give you advice on UTXO set consolidation. It seems Coinbase are stuck in a similar but even worse conundrum, so hopefully they get moving (along with other big players) and we all benefit.
You can do both of course (anyone can fork the at any time) - however you obviously can't force anyone to join your fork and thank god for that. Schnorr signatures will indeed be amazing for people stuck with a lot of UTXO dust and just overall mempool bloat. The future is bright in my opinion, even without a hard fork block size increase on Bitcoin anytime soon.

The important distinction is that you can create anything from decentralized to centralized second layer protocols on a decentralized base layer but you can only make centralized second layer protocols on a centralized base layer.

This makes zero sense. They have expenses, they either reduce them or stop doing business altogether. 
Demand for block space on the Bitcoin network is indeed growing faster than the technical solutions are able to scale at the moment, this doesn't mean we should panic and stop trying to develop the base layer of sound money.
Stop viewing Bitcoin as a business that needs to do anything it can to keep up with a surge in customers. It's an open source software protocol that can be forked by anyone who disagrees with developement. Still pushing for an urgent block size increase on Bitcoin after Bcash and the SW2X farce seems as productive as shouting into a pillow.
There are plenty of more centralized options for you to choose from if cheap transactions are your main priority, if you **really** want to help scale Bitcoin and not just try to cause a panic so people run to alts, contributing to developement.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:41:49
A fee market will develop, but as the actual costs in electricity pr. transaction is incredibly low (unlike the limited amt. of on-chain txs) **and** it will be in all the users interest to have low LN fees, I suspect we'll see fees of a low amount of satoshis pr. hop. This is obviously just me guessing, but I think &lt;100 satoshis pr. transaction will be the norm (perhaps a lot lower). Compared to 20-50k satoshis we're seeing atm (obviously depending on tx type) I'm sure it'll be very cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:34:42
Perhaps, I try to give people the benefit of doubt. 
But there has been an alarming number anti SW, LN and "we need to HF NOAW!" posts here lately. The amount of FUD that is being pushed around regarding SW and LN is bullish as hell IMO, various altcoiners know the success of this would ruin their whole spiel.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:56:54
I strongly disagree with that. Altcoins with more centralized developement and short history of functioning stably are the last thing anyone rational would trust with the task of storing any meaningful amount of wealth.
The number one priority just isn't retail transactions (although the strides LN are making these days make it seem a lot closer than just a few months ago).
The fact that the protocol has proven resilient to takeover attempts, is very expensive to attack at the consensus level and has functioned stably for almost 9 years is what makes people trust it enough to consider it a SoV. As it continues to function (even if transactions become more expensive) this trust will continue to increase. More people will realize that Bitcoin is not going away regardless of how much anyone want it to.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:57:22
I think the term "whale" is being thrown around way too lightly here. In my opinion a whale is someone that can have a meaningful impact on the market in the short/medium term. With billions of USD being traded daily, you'd need a lot more than $1.5MM today for me to consider you a whale.
Sure, if you have 100 BTC you're rich by most standards but you're still a small fish in the ocean.

The concrete proposal **was** indeed very short-notice, especially considering the dev support. This should be apparant by the complete failure to even fork. I think it had what 4 critical bugs in the code? It was the pretty much the worst way you could go about actually hard forking Bitcoin. 
*"But if only Bitcoin Core had agreed it would have went smoothly"*.. Perhaps it would have and maybe that should lead to greater respect for what the developers say over the people more concerned about their quarterly report than the long term viability of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:49:56
Trading is a negative sum game (transaction fees, custodial risks and trading fees), holding is not. You don't only have to beat the average trader to have success with selling and buying more, you have to beat like 90%.
There's a good reason why active trading in the stock market is generally something that will lose you money over holding long term.
Equating them both as gambling because neither is risk free is ridiculous.

They *are* an issue but whining about them instead of contributing to improving the situation is worthless noise. Bitcoin is an open source project, it's not a business that owes it's customers some level of sort service. 
Do you have any suggestions on how to solve this that are better than the current "roadmap"? (for lack of a better term): Let SW adoption increase through incentive and education while Schnorr signatures, MAST and LN is developed, tested and deployed. If you think a hard fork is a realistic and good solution after the BCH and SW2X debacles, I'm not sure what to tell you.
Bitcoin will scale, but it is clear that a large group of users and developers does not want to compromise how it scales in order to avoid temporary high-fee period and bail out businesses and users that mainly are concerned about the viability of small transactions. Thus, hard forking a block size at this point would inevitably create another altcoin, likely less popular than the last one.
Saying fees are pricing out poor people and businesses and ruining the entire goal of Bitcoin is in my opinion incredibly short sighted. People have been spoiled by the early days and the low demand for block space has created unrealistic expectations for there to always be “almost free” transactions for anyone in the world on-chain. 
There is nothing wrong with preferring a less conservative scaling approach, but I think it makes sense that the original network with by far the most value stored in it, isn’t being developed reactionary to short term changes.
If you are genuinely curious about the scaling approach I think many Bitcoiners and Bitcoin Core contributors align with, listen to Marty Bent's recent podcast "Tales from the Crypt  A conversation with John Newbery" - I think that sums up the vision that many "small blockers" have.
Here is the link to the podcast: 
Listen to it if you want to get beyond the feemongering (pun intended) "think of the poor people and businesses" and "it will be overtaken by low-fee alternatives!!" rhetoric.

With current technology and if it needs to be a global the network for all economic activity, sure. However, there are many complimentary scaling solutions being worked on (on and off chain) that are not a blocksize increase.
Saying that we need a block size increase soon because we need it to be able to support billions of people being on second layers in the future is sort of a weird line of reasoning to me (if that was indeed what you were arguing).

I never advocated storing 100% of your wealth in Bitcoin, however ignoring this completely and banking on it dying after it has proven to be extremely resilient for close to 9 years now is in my opinion ignorant.
I'm sure you have done extensive research on the attack vectors on the Bitcoin network as your basis of the 99% loss of value. Perhaps you should consider shorting it. By doing so (on USD settled futures) you can make up for the loss of purchasing power your USD is guaranteed to have.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:25:27
Yea, there definitely is a no holds barred fight for the brand going on at the moment. I don't think there not being an owner of the brand is a bad thing, of course there are downsides, more friction in development - but I think the project would be doomed to fail if it was any other way.
Nobody really knew how this tech would scale in the early days. I think many were guilty of overpromising (Free, immutable transactions for everyone in the world!) because we were spoiled by extremely low demand for block space in the early days. For this reason, people feel something is being taken away from them. 
I think the properties of sound money should come in the following order: Store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account. We arguably started out being a medium of exchange, mostly then moved to becoming more of a store of value as the network proved its resilience block for block. Now the medium of exchange property is being priced out (for many use cases) and this upsets people. 
Many "small blockers" believe that a larger scale medium of exchange, in a contentious environment, should be built in a way that is backward compatible as to not compromise with the store of value prooerty. Others argue that there can't be a store of value that is not also a good medium of exchange (even if it's just a phase). I disagree with this notion and feel that if we want this system to have long-term success, we can't compromise due to momentary complaints of early adopters.
I also believe that second layer protocols is the only realistic way this network will support visa level traffic and beyond without turning it into something that is hardly as revolutionary.

Bitcoin was not launched a finished product but rather a constantly developing, bleeding-edge technology. We should not compromise the project for short term utility. Pricing out utility as a payment system for smaller transactions instead of moving fast and breaking things makes sense. It is what has made and will make Bitcoin endure as secure and censorship-resistant money.

Non SW txs will become cheaper as well if SW txs are more widely adopted at same throughput demand. Unless they still think not implementing SW is a realistic way to "fire Core" and get a blocksize increase, implementing it ASAP should be their priority if they want any chance of consolidating their UTXOs.

Scaling is a constant process, nothing will come along and fix what everyone considers a problem over night. If you don't have the patience to wait, the are plenty of more centralised options for cheap and fast payments. Bitcoin is a long term focused open source project, it is not a business and you're not a customer. Complaining that it does not work how you'd like for it to work seems like a waste of time over contributing or using something that aligns more with your priorities.
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:02:57
I see, thanks for the quick response - some solid points.
I didn't mean to infer that you were saying this would solve spam attacks. I just initially thought you were arguing that Schnorr signs would somehow be a lot more efficient at preventing malicious spam than something like SW or a block size increase. I may be alone in having had this misunderstanding.
I really do appreciate your work. "Layman's coverage" on these topics is incredibly important and can be hard to come by. Hoping to see more from you in the future!

You're making a lot of assumptions there. You have no clue if he prefers to DCA his way to a larger amount of BTC, what sort of costs are associated with this vs. buying himself and so on. Whether he can pay the majority of his bills in BTC thus not needing to convert back regularly etc.
Sure, he's *probably* being a bit reckless here but outright labeling him an idiot without knowing anything about his situation is in my opinion idiotic.
I'm sure McAfee would like that ;)
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:04:40
Have you been living under a rock for the past year? We already had a group of people fork off who believed individual verification through low-cost full nodes are not important to Bitcoin.
Arguing for a hard block size increase at this point seems to me as productive as trying to occupy wall street by sleeping in a tent outside JP Morgan. There is **clearly** a large amount of users and devs that disagree with this scaling approach, this guarantees a disruptive split if pursued that will almost certainly leave the forkers on a another minority altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:57:32
Read my post again. I said it would be *closer* to 5 months than 5 years.
Five months is perhaps overly optimistic, but I would be surprised if we did **not** see it somewhat widely available on the main chain in 2018. 5 years is imo way more absurd than 5 months.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:38:32
Storing wealth in an unsiezable permissionless way **is** an incredible important use case of bitcoin.
You don't have to buy groceries in order to be using Bitcoin.
People seem confused into thinking the only innovation is p2p payments due to the use of terms lie "crypto*currency*" and "p2p electronic *cash*".
I can store $100M in my brain that *can* be transacted on a network that has proven resilient to takeovers at the protocol level and attacks at the consensus level and incredibly stable. That is **way** more powerful than being able to pay Netflix pr. second  I watch.
Cheap transactions are cool and all but if you think they are they are the important innovation behind this technological breakthrough, you're sorely mistaken. Clearly the market is either telling you that they value an immutable, unseizable, provably scarce asset as a store of value or people simply have patience and confidence that the second layer protocols that are being developed will make smaller transactions practical. I think both probably applies.

@_date: 2017-12-07 03:34:45
It IS working though, just not as fast as you'd like for it to be working. Throughput is slowly increasing (we will only see some major benefits once the embarrassingly slow service providers start supporting it) and progress on 2nd layers IS happening at a much more rapid rate now that rolling it out on main net is feasible.
I can totally get that frustration, we spend a lot of time in a deadlock, but I think it's important to cherish what we have here instead of breaking it with clearly contentious hard forks. High fees is pricing out certain use cases for Bitcoin at the moment, other blockchains serving those purposes while BTC scales is fine.
People are doing a lot more than talking, look at the actual projects and not just the "LN is centralized bloatware" blogs that gets spammed around here.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:20:00

Legitimizes Bitcoin as an entirely new asset, further removing it from the "drug money for nerds" stereotype. It probably also increases the likelihood of an American Bitcoin ETF next year.

@_date: 2017-12-27 20:15:44


No, obviously not for that reason. Rather because they're obviously way more competent at producing high quality code.
I'm sure they care about adoption too (I know I do) but not at any cost. It might not be a great payment network for a while but if it can become the base layer of sound money for decades to come, people not being able to buy groceries today is a small sacrifice. Use and promote SegWit if you care about fees, that is what the service providers should've done, clearly many of them care more about making Bitcoin Core developers look bad than bettering the fee situation.

The good thing about LN is that it's opt in, I don't think it will play out anything like the doomsday picture you and many others are portraying. However, if it does, the base layer remains unchanged.
This is bleeding-edge technology in an entirely new field done mostly by open source developers volunteering, there are no guarantees.

Amazing how you could misinterpret it so much. "STFU" in this context basically means "stop being a pussy, constantly looking at the price and reconsidering your investment thesis when it's crashing". 
This is sound advice for almost everyone, people lose a lot of money trading on emotions. They buy more without fundamental changes when it goes up and sell without fundamental changes when it goes down. This meme attempts to reduce this emotional behaviour in a funny way.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:34:53
Yea, it's evident that we have different priorities and that is fine. 
I don't believe in compromising out of fear of losing market share. I prefer to leave moving fast and breaking things to other projects. Security and immutability is what separates Bitcoin from the rest, if we start scrambling to hard fork to beat the latest "better tech" projects alleged thousands of tx/s and cheap fees, then I think risk of actually being overtaken becomes MUCH greater.
Bitcoin is the big dog in this race, it will continuously be attacked by others trying to disrupt it and/or take it's place. We could hard fork tomorrow and even if it worked perfectly fine, somehow didn't decrease the node count, further bloat UTXO set creation, incentivize further mining centralization and all that other stuff - we could still EASILY be back at "way too high" fees in two weeks. Spamming Bitcoins mempool is trivial at this point, especially if you're a large miner.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:31:37
Right, so we should work on increasing throughput through more sustainable measures that are opt-in/have broad community support instead of caving to what could easily be spam attacks.
I'm hopeful that thing like broad SegWit and Schnorr signature adoption will increase on-chain throughput a lot. Then the off-chain solutions is what will really make scaling to VISA levels and beyond plausible.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:24:32
Ah, happy to hear that (assuming you're not some impersonator xD). 
I saw your tweet before it started being massively retweeted and I felt fucking terrible for you knowing it was about to go viral. Since I saw no other tweets from you mentioning Bitcoin I assumed you didn't get back in.
I imagine almost no one managed to hold onto most of their coins from back then and many would probably be better off just never having discovered Bitcoin avoid dealing with crippling regret. Even if you didn't buy back in *that* low, I'm sure Bitcoin has treated you well �� Glad to hear it!

@_date: 2017-12-27 15:09:50
That is your opinion, do you have a realistic solution that is better than SW, LN Schnorr sigs, MAST and sidechains?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:45:47
Let's not get ridiculous.
$500M pr. BTC would imply a total mkt. cap (with 21M coins available) of $10.5 quadrillion, or:
The global stock markets are worth ~$73 trillion, or:
All gold is worth ~$7 trillion, all developed real estate is worth ~$213 trillion.
Even with huge population growth and Bitcoin becoming the global currency this simply would not be an issue. And even if it were it can already be solved somewhat by probabilistic payments on second layers or completely bt a hard fork increasing divisibility.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:56:33
They might be doing so inadvertently due to shitty UTXO management. For example, they have an address that has more than 200 BTC on it, but it's split in more than a million different outputs. It would cost 500-1000 BTC to consolidate it into something spendable.
If they have a lot of these, they are effectively running a fractional reserve (unless trading fees in their possesion more than makes up for the difference).
So they may have the Bitcoin, it's just scattered as unspendable dust on the blockchain, and will be so until we get substantially lower fees and/or Schnorr signatures. It sort of makes sense that they'd push for bigger blocks to get out of this mess, but it makes NO sense that they haven't consolidated it in the last few months when fees were low. I think they are just embarassingly incompetent on the technical side of things. 
Unless they think delaying SegWit further will result in a hard block size increase (which would be pretty damn delusional at this point), their  priority should be to get SW fully adopted in hopes of driving down onchain fees enough so that they have a shot at getting this Bitcoin consolidated.

Couldn't it just find one route and the send the amount equal to the LN node with the smallest balance in the route and then repeat sending txs until the full amount was sent?

You don't want to ignore the advice of the best engineers when scaling complex, new technology. Especially not when trying to build the base layer of sound money that is already worth hundreds of billions of USD.
"Keep it simple stupid" is not the mantra you want to follow here.

I agree, let's get service providers to start using SegWit and transaction batching - that'll be the escape valve allowing more throughput as we see 2nd layer protocols roll out.

OP: It's super hard to say, we're still at a relatively low mkt. cap where something like an ETF, hedgefunds or a single very wealthy individual alone could have a huge impact on the price. 
In my opinion, I think $1,500-$5,000 at end of year would be my pessimistic/optimistic range that I both believe to be within reason and as so suspect we will end up somewhere in between those.
Guessing on a longer scale is way more uncertain and kind of useless without a timeline.

Tagging you to make sure you see the post above by A lot of things could be justified by cherry-picking Satoshi quotes but I think it's a fair argument that a move towards datacenter centralization goes against the entire idea of bitcoin. Bigger blocks may very well be a necessity (and even long overdue) but the negative implications associated with "database bitcoin" should deter people from having a "raw" ever-increasing blocksize as the first scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:06:45
In this analogy the non-technical people demanding blocksize increases without fully understanding implecations of the different scaling solutions would be the impatient passengers and the pilots would be the developers.

Decentralization is a means to an end. The mere existence of opt-in custodial solutions where you weigh the costs and benefits yourself and then freely *choose* whether or not you want to use it - has no impact on Bitcoin and does in no way "make Bitcoin pointless".
Bakkt existing doesn't stop you from never trusting custodians. And even with custodianship and the massive risk involved (limited to the amount of value you store with them) it is infinitely better than fiat + custodians. The monetary supply of Bitcoin is auditable by everyone. Utilizing fractional reserve systems with Bitcoin basically guarantees that you won't be bailed when you become illiquid and this will be a constant, healthy reminder that trusted third parties are security holes.
It is unrealistic for a massive, publicly traded multinational coorporation to start accepting payments any other way. Starbucks shareholders don't want to accumulate Bitcoin on their balance sheet. Adoption in the way you would like (closed loop system or just selling off enough Bitcoin to cover fiat expenses) is much more likely to happen bottom up starting with small businesses, than the other way around.

When the issues are technical I don't believe so. Bitcoin was created by a small group of people (perhaps mainly one guy). It makes little sense have a democratic vote on how fast or at what altitude the plane should fly at.
With that said he isn't really taking a stance on who should have the power to make the decisions but rather that the people not fully comprehending the issues should (like plane passengers in general) be reasonable in the way they express their opinion (by not forcefully storming the cockpit).
I think this is a decent analogy to the non-technical people with overly simplistic views arguing "Bigger blocks = Smaller fees" therefore "Core wants bigger fees", to maybe take a step back and try to get a more well-rounded understanding of the implecations of different scaling solutions before they become extremely vocal and divisive in their arguments. I might be reading into it a bit, but the message as I interpret it, is very much needed - perhaps also for some people that are  "religiously" against ever increasing the blocksize past 1MB.

After posting the pod on twitter, it was pointed out by some Bitcoiners (Matt Odell I believe) that this dude was talking about finally understanding Bitcoin when he heard about Silk Road in 2010 - while it didn't actually launch until 2011.
Obviously, everyone can screw up their timelines but a quick look at this dudes twitter and he looks like some "crypto influencer" guy selling webinars and access to his "1000x crypto trading group" - so it seems likely he was trying to get clout and exposure by lying about being in Bitcoin early.

I think you are looking at this way too narrowly. It's not that they dislike merchant adoption, but rather that they know that the current state of scaling does not support widespread adoption and they don't want to encourage businesses to rely on unsustainable business models (On-chain Starbucks).
I don't think their end goals differ much from yours but I think there's a fundamental disconnect in how they approach getting there.
Spending Bitcoin places that immediately sell for fiat is pretty much just trading the fuzzy feeling of "using crypto" for increased blockchain bloat while outsourcing the selling into fiat to a third party (doing so in smaller chunks). Spending it at businesses that don't instantly liquidate into fiat-coin is obviously very different.
If I'm not mistaken, Song has been talking about "closing the loop" for years, as in getting paid in Bitcoin. I don't think he has given up on Bitcoin at all but is rather trying not to oversell the state of the technology like many did in the early days "instant, free, ucensorable transactions for the entire world!". Meanwhile, many of the guys sharing his sentiment is working tirelessly on actually scaling Bitcoin, both off and on-chain.
If we got for major merchant adoption now, we'd get higher fees and disadoption as well as boat loads of people screaming about evil core supporters crippling Bitcoin, being greedy and/or hating poor people even though they are actually focused on building something that will last long term over pretending to have something that can do it all today.
It's perfectly fine to disagree with their approach but it grinds my gears when people seem to purposely misunderstand it and misrepresent it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:18:52
I think you misunderstood my point which was that it is unreasonable to expect Bitcoin to have intrinsic value (depending on how you define this) since it was never meant to have it. Again, like critizising an banana for beeing a bad frisbee.
Whether or not Bitcoin has intrinsic value depends on what definition of intrinsic value you go by, if you simply mean "usefulness", then sure there are many reasons that Bitcoin is useful. 
This is one of the reasons the intrinsic value argument is fundamentally stupid, it's either a misunderstanding of the meaning of the word (how it is used in finance) or an unreasonable expectation that shows a clear misunderstanding of what Bitcoin is to begin with.

It's not them actually purchasing it that could perhaps be affecting the market but rather the publicity that Bitcoin is getting through this news-cycle.

@_date: 2018-10-30 19:38:20
You are upset that "*no one* [is] even talking about this" - yet they are, they have been. A LOT.
People are talking (and much better yet, developing) a ton on improving scaling and fungibility. You are focusing on one parameter (block size) which effectively was increased ~1.7-2x in August last year after more than ~8 years of having lower max. on-chain throughput on Bitcoin.
A "dumb" on-chain throughput increase that only adjusts max block size parameter, requires a hard fork and has proven to be HIGHLY contentious with Bitcoin users at this time. Thankfully, Bitcoin is very resistant to contentious consensus changes.
Never has the pace of protocol improvement and reasearch (base layer and above) been higher than over the last year. It literally exploded after a long deadlock due to tx malleability being fixed. With that and the fact that we had the BCH fork recently in mind, stirring up drama over there not being a lot of talk of a specific scaling solution (based on a "napkin calculation" estimate from a paper that had to make a ton of now outdated assumptions) seems incredibly silly to me.
@_date: 2018-10-30 16:09:50
You are quoting an old block size estimation from the original LN publication on the estimated block size needed for global adoption  and acting up over the fact that scaling (solely by the LN) isn't "solved" yet for 7B people.
I think you're being highly unreasonable, repeating the panicky/emotional "upgrade NAOW or we're doomed" sentiments so prevelent in the block size war we just went through.

Alright, good to hear you're not a complete write-off ;) 
I agree that people aren't holding back in their critisicm of SW2X but I personally think it is justifiable. A handful influential businessmen and what could probably justifiably be described as a mining cartel deciding to hardfork the protocol without broad support of the community (and basically no support from the open source devs that has been stewards of the network for the past 8 years) IS something that should be spoken out strongly against IMO.
It's great to see that we finally broke the scaling stalemate with SegWit implementation but not letting the results of that be clear before locking in an obvious highly contentious hard fork is reckless. It makes sense that it is basically unanimously opposed by the group of devs that are concerned with the security of the $60B+ network they're maintaining.
I'm not a fan of tactless personal attacks but I can understand why people are unhappy with guys like Jeff Garzik and Roger Ver based on their actions.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:39:19
It seems to me that you're thinking too much in $ terms rather than in % terms.
We're up less than 4x in the last 8 months. The huge correction of 75% in 2013 came after a 10x in 8 weeks. Are you certain this is absurd growth? I sure think a lot has changed in terms of mainstream acknowledgement of Bitcoin this year.

@_date: 2017-08-08 10:38:16
I disagree, not risking contentious forks that can severly damage the network &gt; having fees that limits small purchases on chain for a bit.
Bitcoin has the potential to change the world, let's not risk that (even if the risk is very small) because a couple of us lucky early adopters can't do small transactions on the main chain very cheaply for a short amount of time.
Taking such a huge risk for a couple of months of being able to buy smaller things is in my opinion detrimental to everyone.
If all it took for us to rush a hard fork was a few weeks of high tx fees, then it would be way too cheap for outsiders to effectively buy such a change.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:40:22
A gradual throughput increase as wallets and users update. Probably nothing dramatic tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:25:40
Sure, such an attack would ONLY be able to decrease the avg. blocktime temporarily and it would be incredibly expensive depending depending on how dramatic a blocktime increase they were going for.
It also would not affect value transfers on second layer protocols, which I enviosion will have most of the fee and time sensitive transactions at some point in the not too distant future.
The bigger the network becomes the more expensive it becomes to attack it and the more you attack it. Covering up this sort of mass production of ASIC miners would probably be almost impossible and publicly trying to disrupt Bitcoin like this would only make it more well known and probably be great for adoption.
An attack on fiat on-ramps would be more plausible IMO but it would also backfire badly long term.

Dude, where have you been for the last 3 years? The block size "debate" has been had many thousand times, repeating the same arguments ad nauseam won't change a thing. 
Luckily, a faction that believed on-chain scaling didn't have unfortunate trade-offs has forked off (or gone to other altcoins long ago) and we can now focus on building for the long term. This does not mean panicking that Bitcoin does not currently scale to support global adoption only 10 years after being a theoretical concept.
I'm especially happy that we got rid of some influential individuals who were sucessfully stalling scaling as a power-play for control. Finally, since August of last year we are seeing some real advancements in scaling both on and off chain.
LN (while extremely promising) is not the last bastion of Bitcoin scaling. Making panicky decisions in base layer protocol design because Bitcoin cannot currently support 7B+ people is like trying to evacuate earth in shitty space shuttles because the sun will boil the oceans in a billion years. Thankfully, Bitcoin consensus has proven resilient to hasty, emotional decisions based on arguments like "BLOCK SIZE INCREASE NAOW OR SUPERIOR TECH WILL EAT OUR LUNCH!1!" or "Think of the poor people!!".
Bitcoin is a long play and in the scope of what it can potentially become, 10 years is nothing.

Brokerages can create whatever exotic, fractionally reserved BS derivatives they want. Thankfully, no matter how exotic, they won't hinder you or I from running our nodes or controlling our own Bitcoin UTXOs.
Bitcoin works due to the incentives of human greed and self-interest. Good, bad and ugly people, companies and governments will enter eventually. Thankfully, try as they might, they won't control the protocol.
In my opinion, the legacy financial sector getting heavily involved only serves to legitimize Bitcoin and make it way harder to delay adoption with law.

I heard Doge Coin fees were even cheaper AND faster too! 
If your main concern is fast and cheap transactions then you hardly even need a blockchain. If you're concerned with things like decentralization and censorship resistance then I'm sure you can see the importance of a little bit of patience. 
Transaction throughput on the BTC blockchain will gradually start increasing with SegWit live and end up being ~70-100% higher. It activates in [53 blocks]( (!!!)
This should be a nice alleviation of the fees and without requring a hard fork of the network. Obviously, even twice the throughput is nowhere near enough as Bitcoin continues it's spectacular growth in userbase. Thankfully SegWit indirectly provides longer term scaling solutions too. With SegWit live and second layer trustless protocols feasible for devs to build the pace of developement on these projects will rocket.
I don't want to pay $5 to send Bitcoin either but complaining about fees right now is like complaining about being broke the day before payday and with a huge christmas bonus coming up too.
Bitcoin has the potential to change the world, let's not lose sight of what makes this technology special by compromising it's properties because us priviliged early adopters want cheap transactions right now. Bitcoin should not be run like an Silicon Valley start up that needs to 100x invested capital or go bust trying - it's way too important for that.

Sure, because it's not really a good argument against it. In the grand scheme of things (years of deadlock) a few weeks of gradual throughput is immediate enough in my book.

You can obviously use it, just not without paying a bit more. Your mastercard analogy would be something like litecoin - which is great, move some traffic there for a bit until we have the segwit throughput boost in 2-3 weeks and then we can start looking at fees.
In the whole "change the world" scheme, a short few weeks/months of high fees should not make us hurry and risk this thing.
I get that it has been frustrating to watch the political scaling stalemate but now Segwit is coming and after that second layers - a little bit of patience would at this point be prudent.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:41:45
That is off-chain transactions that a blocksize increase has **no** effect on. 
Similar to the Lightning Network in being off-chain, dissimilar in being centralized, requiring trust in a third party and generally being **much** more expensive (typically a flat percentage fee instead of a fee pr. kb).
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:29:13
SegWit is a protocol upgrade that improves throughput on-chain relatively short term and off chain longer term.
Perhaps blaming the people who blocked it for all this time would be more appropriate?
I agree that it sucked it took this long but like I said, whining about it not being an INSTA-fix but rather a gradual throughput boost after years of scaling deadlock is shortsighted at best and FUD-spreading bullshit at worst.

@_date: 2017-08-23 18:31:14
Nope, but people that have patience beyond a few days will start to see the benefits. Everyone will be incentivized to use SW transactions since they will be cheaper so while it is impossible to say how many days it will take for throughput to go up by 50% the incentives dictate a rather quick upgrade.
For this reason and a few others, complaining about fees **right now** is (if you understand the changes to come) like a kid complaining that he can't open his presents the day before Christmas, in my opinion of course.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:52:55
It would cost a lot more than that, probably closer to 100bn if not even more. It would have to be done by emptying OTC markets and order books over time adding an insane amount of buying pressure thus increasing the price tremendously. The price of the last bitcoin would probably be over 100k.
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:53:25


Where can I see that for myself? Do you have any proof or is this just wishful thinking on your part?
I can't see any hashrate increase, in fact a few [different]( [sources]( show that BCH hashrate as a percentage of BTC hashrate is down over the last day or two, Peaking at 8.15% and currently sitting at 4.76%. 
This means that either less hashing power is moving to BCH than is comming online on BTC or hashing power from BCH is moving back to BTC. Or perhaps this all manipulated by the mighty Core devs? :)

Scaling Bitcoin on second layers will now become much more technically feasible (maybe you've heard of Lightning Network?). 
Furthermore, beginning in ~two weeks we will se an increase in transaction throughput (the amount of transactions getting in each block or on the blockchain per time unit) which will come with an expected reduction in median fees and avg. time you need to wait to get into a block at a given fee level.
The transaction mallebility fix that allows more easy implementation of second layers like LN also opens up to a lot of other exciting things you can now build on top of the base protocol.
Perhaps the best event in Bitcoin I've witnessed and I've been here for almost 4 years.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value, not in Bitcoin, not in fiat not in gold. 
It's a shitty red herring argument repeated by old guys in suits too lazy, proud or technically incapable of doing their own due diligence and realize that what makes Bitcoin valuable (like anything else) is its usefulness and potential usefulness. 
It has a a lot of unique properties:
* Immutability
* Provable scarcity and reliable deflationary supply
* Global permissionless accessibility and true digital ownership without requiring any central authority to uphold it 
* Incredibly easy transportability and divisibility
* Extremely difficult and expensive to censor (even short term).
* The network effects derived by being the first of its kind
* The safety of being secured a huge amount of computer power, running securely now on the ninth year. 
I probably even forgot some properties here but In short, it has properties not ever seen before it, making it quite a technological breakthrough. It can be difficult to understand and it has the potential for immense disruption so naturally it will not be embraced by everyone.

I don't mean to be a dick about it but read my bulletpoints above again, *that* is it, it does all of the above simultaniously and that is new.


The average consumer doesn't care... until they do. If you live in a western country with little obvious corruption and without wild inflation it can be harder to "get" why Bitcoin is needed. Frankly, in a perfect world where everyone could be trusted we would not need it, but like it or not, that's not the world we live in. 
Furthermore, Bitcoin doesn't even need to be digital cash money used by average consumers to have immense success, functioning purely as a store of value/digital gold (which I would argue it does mostly today) is not something you should underestimate the value of.


And no, it cannot be replicated by another platform easily, if replicated it will by default compromise a bunch of the properties I described above, there have been thousands of attempts, somehow none of them has managed to do it better (if you let the market be the judge). There is of course not absolute guarantee that this will be the case forever *but* it is definite proof that it is not easy. 
If scaling blockchains without compromising security and reliability was as simple as lowering the block time and increasing the block size, then Bitcoin would have either adapted or been overtaken by an altcoin by now. It is not, it's a very complex subject that laymen should dedicate a lot of time researching before making flippant "why don't they just.." remarks.

No worries, I'm not your guy for cost estimation though.
A far more plausible way of a government controlling a large amount of hashrate would be them seizing existing mining operations and asic chip production facilities. At this point it would only be possible for the Chinese government to do in a meaningful way. As other chip producers catch up (they will) this attack vector should be reduced too.
At the end of the day I'm not too worried about these sort of attacks being able to do anything other than disrupting the network short term. Bitcoins antifragile nature will probably see these attacks fail spectacularly as they only bring more attention to the technology.

What are you trying to say here? That because we had a pullback of 75% back in 2013 we will have a pullback of 75% on the next occasion?
If we're going to base our expected size of a correction on the worst one in "modern" BTC history, we should also look at the bullrun that came prior. In 2013 the Bitcoin price roughly 10'xd in 8-10 weeks before falling 75%. If we apply the same timelines to this market we would need to see a price at $20k+ which would still leave us above $5k after the 75% pullback.
Granted, I think it's stupid to expect the same behaviour in todays market since it is *much* more liquid and global (dozens of exchanges instead of one in the MtGox days).
Still, I think $20k in 10 weeks is probably as likely as a 75% pullback from here. Neither are likely at all.

The Korona was introduced as the first paper money printed in Hungary. (initially as 1, 2, 25 and 200 notes). It suffered massive inflation and at the end had 500k and 1MM notes.
*Then* it was replaced by the Pengõ at a rate of 12,500:1. The Pengõ later suffered from hyperinflation (beyond the extent of the Korona) before it was replaced gradually by Adópengõ alongside it and finally by the Forint.
Korona -&gt; Pengõ -&gt; Pengõ + Adópengõ -&gt; Forint.
So yes, they did have Korona and they did experience hyperinflation while having it. Also, yes they had Pengõ when inflation was at its worst.
So while he wasn't entirely precise, he did not "invent" any "made up thing". He even included a link where you could read about the Korona and Pengõ inflation instead of jumping straight to your smug rebuttal.

People are still not used to the idea of "commodities" with deflationary supply that is not price-sensitive. If the gold or oil price booms, more will be extracted in order to take advantage of it, this effect is impossible with Bitcoin. As mining rewards decrease and more coins are lost or locked up in the strong hands of hardened holders, buyers will have to fight over an increasingly smaller supply. If demand keeps rising, we'll see fireworks.
Bitcoin is a technology we've never seen before and as an asset it has performed like nothing we've ever seen before. There will be violent corrections, but I'm not betting on this stallion suddenly being tamed.

Average fee is a terrible measure as single exorbitant outliers push this number up **way** more than a low fee can possibly push it down (given the floor of 0 sats/b).
Right now, fees as low as 5 sat/b is clearing from the mempool ( on an tx of 500 bytes this means a 22 cents in fees. And it's of course only half in a 1 input 2 outputs tx.
Sure, this fee level is unrealistic if you want to be included in the next block. But paying $5 or more is unnecessary 99% of the time, even if you want quick confirmations.
We've seen people with an agenda intentionally overpay or misrepresent the situation in order to concern troll about fee levels and drive people to altcoins. If the only thing you are concerned about is fee levels, then perhaps Bitcoin is a laughing stock but if you care even a little bit about decentralization, immutability and security then you should not be laughing.
Also, using SegWit txs will drastically lower the fees you pay, as service providers start supporting this it will become possible to use in more situations and increase total on-chain throughput by a meaningful amount.

I know it probably sucks to have sold at such a discount but that was your own decision. In hindsight it wasn't he best call, some made a different one and earned more money than they lost originally. 
It was either them going into liquidation and lawyers and accountants most likely eating through whatever was left or a majority equity conversion where the business lives to have a future revenue and pay back token and shareholders with profits going forward.

I do look forward to the Bitfinex audit (in three weeks, maybe?) that will hopefully put a damper on this fud-train, but i'm sure it will be spun by a few in some negative way regardless.

Sure, I never claimed otherwise. As my link showed these were the lowest fee txs that were being included in blocks. This constantly changes as the mempool grows/decreases.


That is an opinion, I don't think 60 minutes and especially not 10 is extremely slow for trustless settlement finality. In fact, this is incredibly fast compared to VISA and PayPal - which can be several months.


I disagree, small retail payments make sense to be 0-conf (with a small fee-premium), running out and double spending your frappuccino to your own address should legally be no different than shoplifting. I think you vastly overestimate the amount of people that will do this. Now of course, with online services this is a different story and more business dependent.


Right, scaling blockchains without compromising the core attributes is definitely a challenge. There are a lot of people hard at work at solving this on Bitcoin - a lot of exciting potential solutions are being tested as we speak after years of development.


False, we JUST got SegWit after years of stalemate. This is neither an instant fix nor a permanent one, but it is incredibly important to the feasibility of exponential (off-chain) scaling.


Sorry for being blunt but this reek of arrogance. We've seen waves of new people come into the community and say, "why don't we just do X, it's so simple and better", but the actual experts in the field that care about the viability of the system long term more than cheap transactions today are almost unanimously and for very good reason, not recommending these hastily rolling out these "EZ tweaks".
We're witnessing the construction of "the internet of money", the foundation is extremely important to get as solid as possible, even if this means compromizing with one of the usecases (smaller value transfers) for a few early adopters in a certain period.
Here is a fresh presentation on this very topic from the Baltic Honeybadger conference given yesterday by one of the real experts on the subject, Adam Back:

It could also prove not to be. Your speculation adds nothing. 
It's impossible for a new ASIC miner to sell their first batch without *some* trust on the part of the buyers. It doesn't matter how public the company is, the risk of failing to deliver is always going to be non-zero. 
We would get *nowhere* if everyone cared so much about the possibility of their credibility going down by endorsing the wrong things, that they never endorsed anything.
BTW, when did *you* buy into Bitcoin? 2010? The same day you first heard of it?
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:43:58
I plan on doing so. But keeping large amounts on any exchange is not something i recommend or practice myself so I'll have to dissapoint you with saying that I won't be losing much if I end up one the "wrong side of history".
Even if Bitfinex runs solidly with no incidents for the next five years and while paying back their new shareholders with high monthly dividends, I'm sure you'll still be waiting for them to go forward with their double-exit master plan.

You could buy BTC or any other cryptocurrency that is available on their site with the USD recieved from the BFX redemption and then without issue withdraw those to wherever you wanted. 
People are quick to scream "Gox 2.0" and their pessimism is not entirely without merit after the hack. However, if you look at the evidence (other exchanges having issues with USD banking partners and crypto being able to be withdrawn) I am confident this is indeed just an issue with US banks "cracking down" on crypto rather than a solvency issue.
Make up your own mind from the evidence rather than the baseless fud and most importantly, keep the majority of your cryptocurrency holdings on private keys.

Of course it is not going to be exactly 2000% - but are you going to dispute the fact that bitcoin mining in general is a low margin business where a 20% efficiency boost would be very significant?
I'm sure Jihan would fight hard to keep the status quo if he was using ASICBOOST and "just" had a 300% profit increase due to it.
The 20x is obviously a guess and it might be off by a lot. The important point is that ASICBOOST would not just be a 20% profit increase but rather something much more significant that better explains blocking what should be an uncontroversial protocol improvement.
The important take away from Antonopolous' talk was *not* the exact 2000% figure. Critizing him for this, makes it seem like you either missed the point or are trying to argue against SW no matter what.

You can shit on Bitfinex as much as you wish for going to the BitGo hot-wallet solution and perhaps being justified in doing so.

@_date: 2017-04-04 09:31:51
All of that is based on the assumption that the hack was an "inside job". I think that's an unlikely conspiracy theroy to be honest, especially the way you frame it. 
There's no way I think they could have had the foresight to know they would be able to actually pull through with such an elaborate scheme. As long as they are in business (and probably beyond that) the hacked coins will be very hard to actually spend/exchange into fiat. Hardly worth potentially destroying such a promising business over.
And lol @ 


Damn, that is some evil shit. You're telling me they're a for-profit business taking fees? How dare they? They convinced customers to use them? Wow, scumbags. They then used future profits to pay back people who lost money?! Even Stalin couldn't have been this cruel.

Buffett made his fortune by being a value investor in "simple" businesses not by being able to foresee what users of the internet would demand and how to simplify mobile payments.
Buffett is amazingly talented at what he does but he's probably not the best guy to foresee how new potential disruptive technology will impact society. The prospect of the USD NOT being the world reserve currency clashes with his mental models.
Also, this thread is about Jack Dorsey's prediction. Obviously nobody has a crystal ball and disagreeing with him is fine but it's at least interesting to see someone **that** prominent in tech take such a stance.

Objectively, parking your money in bitcoin as an investment vehicle is not comparable to a guaranteed rate, negative or not. More like putting all your savings in a volatile stock which is stupid as hell (if the amount is substantial to you) even if you're confident Bitcoin will do well.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:06:12
That's fair. Still, there are tech prerequisits to even discerning Bitcoin from a complete pie in the sky. Prerequisits that I'm not sure Warren Buffett has personally.
While I don't think Jack is likely to be correct in his prediction of Bitcoin overtaking USD within 10 years, I also don't agree with the group of economists that claim money is a solved field where arbitrarily, inauditable, inflationary fiat money is both the best iteration and one that is sustainable long term. 
There were obvious game-theoretical advantages to being an economy *not* on the gold standard when neighbouring countries you traded with were. How the game theory of decentralized, auditable money with a deflationary supply curve plays out in a global economy with hundreds of state actors and what sort of implications it will have on societies will be very interesting. I think the outcome is somewhat binary, either very vast implications or almost none and you can probably guess which way I'm leaning ;)

Store of value is not only about stability but about rarity or issuance. Land and gold are good stores of value because they are rare and we don't expect to find large new quantities anytime soon. Bitcoin is even better because issuance is completely predictable.


I do, so that is blatantly wrong. A lot of others feel the same way and I think the amount of people that do is well correlated with the price.


International bank wires are illegal now? Damn. Also, what are fees at the moment?


Ah, when did you sell? did you panic sell the bottom after buying into the same shit-tier arguments you are peddling? 3.8k CAD is not "fairly early" btw, that's like 7-10 months ago, Bitcoin has been running for like 9 years now and been traded on markets with orderbooks for 6 or 7.

Sounds like someone is invested in a lot of altcoins. 
I think it will largely be a winner takes all for store of value with the most secure one winning out and on top of that will be built rails for payment.
There only exists hundreds of fiat moneys because of state authority. Now, there will obviously **exist** a lot more than one since they are trivial to built and keep alive, but I think it's highly unlikely we see dozens or more of them being highly liquid and widely used in commerce.
Also, just because you think something is outrageous or wrong, that it doesn't make it click bait.

We have to make an important distinction when it comes to widespread Bitcoin adoption.
Bitcoin gives individuals the opportunity to opt out of a system where they have to trust a third party (in relation to the reserve, ability to transact and changes in the monetary base). Bitcoin does *not* force full reserve on anyone. Individuals and companies will still be able to issue debt (BTC denominated or otherwise) to any willing lenders.
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:16:37


This is just wrong. The system self-adjusts. If it becomes unprofitable for some and they as a result stop mining, it will become more profitable for those that remain.
Also, all of the new large mining farms I've heard being built are being located in places with large surpluses of renewable (CHEAP) energy, be it hydroelectric power in Canada, Washington State or Norway or geothermal power in Iceland.
The whole "Bitcoin will kill the environment" narrative is vastly overblown.

Obviously, if both are 1 sat/b and BTC is worth 10x as much, BCH will be cheaper measured in USD. However, BitPay consistently has BTC a lot higher in %, even when there is plenty of block space.
It sounds like you are a BCH supporter that hang out here to tell everyone how X is not actually good news or Y is bad tech etc. What a grand waste of time for everyone involved. If you think you spending hours on here talking shit will have any meaningful impact in the world you're deluded. Good tech will win, if you are confident LN sucks, let it play out and suck.

Indeed. 
This is not even a matter of whether you are pro or anti Bitcoin. Your reasoning has zero logical basis.
It's fine that you read in a Forbes "article" that Bitcoin will boil the oceans, but it has nothing to do with the double spending problem.
Another thing you seem to have grossly misunderstood is that the amount of energy the Bitcoin network uses has no direct relationship to the amount of transactions processed on-chain. What determines the amount of money spent on energy to mine Bitcoin is the value of mining rewards (e.i. market rate of the block reward + fees).
Bitcoin could have a day with 5x the amount of transactions as the day before and the energy usage would be unaffected (unless fees by the additional txs made a meaningful difference to the mining rewards).
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:41:43


Enabling trustless/auditable digital scarcity was a computer science problem that was solved with Bitcoin. I have no idea what point you are trying to make, the fact that Bitcoin succeeded in digital scarcity without reliance on a central party has nothing to do with hodling.


Even if Bitcoin was strictly created to be a payment network (it wasn't) that would be as retarded as complaining that people use the internet for streaming videos because it was originally created for the military to exchange information.


If you've only ever heard one argument for buying Bitcoin, you must not have dug very deep.


I prefer to refer to it as a new form of money that in many ways are superior (or can become so with time) to previous moneys.

You're wrong. You clearly have no idea how mining works.
Transaction throughput capacity is unaffected by the amount of miners (ignoring small fluctuations due to difficulty adjustments every 2016th block). 
Disregarding a soft fork that changed the transaction format a year and a half ago, Bitcoin was able to process as many transactions 10 years ago when a guys were mining it with their CPUs as it is today. And barring future base layer network changes it will be able to process the exact same amount in the future, even if the total energy consumption of miners directing their hash power towards it goes up by an order of magnitude.
It's baffling that you are confident enough in your ignorance to even argue this rather than considering that perhaps you are wrong and then go read up on it.
Again, this is not a matter of opinion and entirely unrelated to what you or I feel about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:57:05
This seem to be very misleading. 
It looks like the *diameter* of the circles are the comparable factor and *not* the surface area. 
A circle that is 2x the diameter of another circle will have 4x the surface area. So this comparison makes the differences look much greater than they actually are.
To avoid it, I'd recommend making it like a bar chart with the same width or with surface area if you wanted to use circles.

A blockchain was just one of the puzzle pieces that together allowed it to happen. The others were a consensus algorithm (proof of work) and asymmetric encryption. Combining these was the innovation.


I don't see how that is relevant to the argument of why Bitcoin was created or whether it makes sense to be outraged over how individuals choose to interact with it, but sure I'll indulge you in your questioning.
I bought it because of its unqiue properties. Mainly in terms of scarcity, secure (non-physical storage), portability and ability to transfer value without reliance on a central authority. I believe these properties (along with the developement in improving various aspects of them) will positively influence its value long term.


You should believe whatever you want I'm not here to sell you on the idea of Bitcoin being a superior money.

You can use it perfectly fine for payments without it being stable enough, by simply fixing prices in fiat of choice and having BTC price fluctuate accordingly. 
It's crazy how people get caught up in the volatility destroying all utility except speculation. Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum, it's okay if it can't replace every aspect of the legacy system in one fell swoop.
Volatility should go down over time, but it will likely never be stable like fiat money where there is a fairly consistent loss in purchasing power year after year, as issuance can't be affected.

It's obvious that Bitcoin is hard to value since it has no underlying cash flow or utility as a physical asset. Proclaiming that it is impossible for anything to have long-term sustained value without fitting in to legacy models is ridiculous.
Bitcoin does something that could not be done before it. It's up to you to decide if you ascribe any value to that or not.
Personally, I think it's very short-sighted and somewhat indoctrinated to not even being able to consider that money could ever have value if not produced by a government.

Not at all. What I am against is doing it in a hastened HIGHLY contentious manner which is only guaranteed to cause further confusion and infighting. Especially right after we saw a MAJOR protocol upgrade in SegWit. Not observing the effects of that before rushing in another fork is outright idiotic.
Barry Silbert, Erik Vorhees and all the other DCG backed business owners are fools for going through with this suicide pact. The miners that supported NYA clearly showed they will mine whatever they see the most profit from. They should not trust them to stay with SW2X over Bcash (which they have mined AND hodl'd the shit out of, taking advantage of the shitty EDA). Every BCH maximalist is cheering on for the SW2X fork to divide "the enemy" and it's painfully obvious.
At the end of the day I trust the the developers and users will win out but this could be a huge setback in adoption and ecosystem progress.
A 2MB hf has been on the Bitcoin Core roadmap for a long time, it's only a few loud voices (luke-jr) that are strongly opposed to it. The main opposition to SW2X is the reckless timeline and back-room deal nature of how it came to be. An outright coup attempt on developement in my eyes.

LOL. 


That depends on the level of inflation and while it may be true in single economies with fiat money engaging with other economies with inflatable fiat money, it's doesn't somehow invalidate the feasability of a non-state controlled money with a known supply curve. You are using these terms in context of the current system and drawing, grossly oversimplified, universal conclusions from that.
I'm not gonna engage with "backed by nothing" arguments, you've clearly made up your mind just like I have. It's weird how people like you are so obsessed with this worthless thing that you spend time hanging out online trying to convince others of how stupid it is. Perhaps some tiny, nagging doubt that you may actually be wrong. I bet engaging in that thought is probably terrifying to people with a strong status quo bias.
Bitcoin will continue to exist no matter how much you try to convince people that state issued fiat money is superior on a macroeconomic scale. Only time will tell if the amount of people that see value in a digital scarce, censorship and seizure resistant money continues to increase or not (be it as as store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account or all of the above).

It's certainly not a full audit but it does clear up some of the fud about them only having some shitty, small, unknown bank in Eastern Europe or "no banking at all".
Sure, an audit would be great but it makes perfect sense that getting one done could be difficult and have serious implications on existing banking partnerships. Many banks don't want to touch crypto so being completely transparant about everything is just not possible without likely risking losing said partnerships or worse. Seizure of bank accounts could infact be what turned out to make an otherwise perfectly solvent Tether insolvent.
Simple solution: don't hold Tether and don't hold assets on exchanges you don't trust. If you think Tether is for sure a scam and unbacked, and that it has artificially inflated the prices of everything in this space and will subsequently collapse them when exposed, sell your crypto and sit in fiat. Buy the dip when it happens. I think that one guy who has been really loud about this did so ~$1200.
I'm not some blind Bitfinex/Tether apologist and would not be comfortable holding a large amount of Tether until an audit happened, but I do feel this is blown way out of proportion and that many accusers are getting carried away on the witch hunt and throwing around outright retarded claims of proof of fraud.
Cryptocurrency has a hugely disruptive potential and incredibly volatile, partly due to lack of clear regulation. Not everything is gonna be completely transparant in every jurisdiction in these early days. In a perfect world Bitfinex could publicly name all their banking partners but we don't live in such a world at the moment.

@_date: 2017-09-28 19:23:07
They might be simplifications but neither are lies. Base layer scaling will only take us so far and will come at a cost of decreased centralization (less nodes and more upside for large miners due to increased block propagation time). 
Second layer can for sure be more efficient - any serious computer scientist will agree. It does move some transactions away from the main blockchain but it remains decentralized instead of relying on a third party (we already have that, in all exchanges). Exchanges are also way more efficient than a public blockchain but obviously not at all trustless and thus largely uninteresting.

I'm not gonna tell you how many I have but I can say I've been here for a while and I'm not really worried about short term price fluctuations. 
I'm excited by the prospect of provably scarce person to person currency that is not controlled by private or national banks. The "infinite blockchains" argument rings hollow as a blockchain without a large amount of distributed hashing power securing it is hardly comparable. Anyone can make their own shitcoin. The fact that I can create infinite intranets doesn't make the internet valueless either.

Fartcoin wouldn't be nearly as secure or decentralized on many different levels. Anyone can fork the code and make their own shitcoin but the code without the network of miners, nodes and users would not have the properties that gives it value. It would be trivial to 51% attack or change the consensus rules (inflation rate, coin cap etc). Decentralization is the key to censorship-resistance and immutability and *that* is what Bitcoin does so much better than all the alts and why some consider it digital gold.
I'm not here to convince you to buy Bitcoin or even to think it's a good idea. If you've come to the conclusion that it's silly and should be worth $0, that's perfectly fine.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:02:11
It's not useless because it's volatile, you are evaluating Bitcoin in a vacuum instead of the real world. I prefer to call it "money" over "currency" since that is a broader term with properties that can be divided into 3 main categories.
* Store of value
* Medium of exchange
* Unit of account
Of course it's not gonna be able to be the unit of account from day one. Calling it wishful thinking for not being able to do this from day one is like calling the internet wishful thinking for not being able to stream video in 1994.
It's hilarious how people who don't believe that Bitcoin can work constantly seek out arguments about it - if it's useless and likely to go to 0, why do you even care? Are you trying to convince yourself that you didn't miss a great opportunity by doubling down on your decision to brush it off as useless initially or whats the deal here?
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:28:46
I think this worry is incredibly premature. Similar to "it doesn't scale to every person on the planet currently, so I doubt it will succeed".
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:59:59


No exact numbers sure.


You're saying BCH has been pushing up the USD price of BTC by taking potential sell orders of the USD/BTC order book? If so I agree, if not I have no idea what you mean by this.


But there is; current market price * available supply. 
Since we know the actual available supply much more precisely than fiat (perfectly pricely ignoring lost coins) it makes more sense to talk about the mkt. cap of cryptos than traditional currencies.
However much meaning you ascribe the metric is of course up to you - of course realizing the dollar value of your crypto could have a negative price impact that is notable if you're a big hodler, however other than perhaps some known OTC discount for large amount, current market price is the best metric to measure value by - just like with any other asset.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:45:05
I'll be doing all new deposits on SW adresses for sure, you are helping throughput increase and Bitcoin scale while saving fee $.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:52:28
We did just get a potential ~2x on-chain capacity increase that function like a release valve on when fees become too high (more will be incentivized to use SW).
Longer term I'm confident in second layer protocols making medium-small payments for commercial use more viable but I think the most important thing isn't how fast we can scale but how resilient and secure the network keeps proving to be. Confidence that Bitcoin won't go anywhere fuels the SoV aspect and then payments come later.
I think the "we need to scale fast or we will lose out" is a big misconception, the bulk of the money moving into crypto currency are not looking for a payment network right now.

They believe calling "Bitcoin Cash" "Bcash" is an attempt to undermine it, or something like that.
I usually just call it "BCH" to avoid wasting time on the angry responses but I think it's fine to not want to call it anything with "Bitcoin" in it, even more so after Roger Ver has publicly tried to lie about it *being* Bitcoin.
I guess without using the Bitcoin brand it becomes a lot harder to get new people interested - but longer term I think it would have served them better to embrace something like "Bitcash" from the start. Easier to write and causes less confusion.
**TLDR;** call it whatever you want but if you try having a discussion with a BCH fan that doesn't devolve into mudslinging immediately, use "BCH", "BCC" or "Bitcoin Cash".

No evidence that new people coming into the market are responsible for the run up? Yea, the HORDES of new people opening accounts on fiat on-ramps are just doing so to look at the graphs. No extra demand, it's all people going BCH -&gt; USD -&gt; BTC. Clearly no OTC demand either, GBTC trading at $10k+ is just noise.
Of course there are differences in that AMZN does have the intrinsic financial value in the underlying cashflow of each share, however I current market price remains the obvious way to do these lists. YES, there should be an asterix that it is not 100% liquifiable assets (turned into fiat) but if Bezos jumped ship AMZN would CRASH big time too with it's incredibly low EPS a lot of the price being supported by belief in Bezos going forward.
So I guess you should be active in all the Bezos &gt; Gates news articles too.

If Bitcoin can't function without adding the lost coins to mining rewards, it can't function after those lost funds run out. So all adding them would accomplish was to show that the coin supply is no longer immutable and kicking the can down the road in doing so. That sets the precedent that "we can just add minor inflation" when that can eventually come closer. 
You can't fuck lost coins without compromising what makes Bitcoin special. They should either remain unspent forever or until someone creates a quantum computer to take them (only known public keys really seem vulnerable to this, but that includes Satoshi's ~1M BTC and a large amount of other lost coins from the early days).
Thankfully, due to the design of the halvings, the transition to fee-based rewards will be very, very gradual.

It might sound harsh but that's a good sign that you "invested" too much. We're three weeks out from the ATH. Three weeks is nothing. 
If you are a in it for the long term, do yourself a favor and stop looking at price charts. If you're not in it for the long term you probably shouldn't have gotten in it at all.
Going forward dollar cost averaging might be a better idea for you as it reduces the risks of large % losses in dollar terms significantly (at the cost of doing the same to large % profits).

Standing on its own it is. There obviously is a general correlation between mkt. cap and market depth and liquidity but just because the market cap is relatively high it does not mean that it makes a lot of sense for a trading platform to facilitate trade of the asset. It also doesn't tell you anything at all about who is trading and if they are realistic to become your customers.
Market volume (for markets with fees), transaction activity on the network, search engine stats/news coverage AND user polls are all tools that can help gauge the potential popularity of launching products like this. 
But yea, clearly you now better - their data will be without value and they should forget about interest in their current base of customers and only focus on new ones..

Even at higher efficiency they would still need to produce an ASS LOAD of ASICs to even dent the China dominance. And I'm sure Jihan and co. wouldn't just lay back and watch their hashing share dwindle.

We have very good reason to suspect that it will be a lot cheaper because unlike on-chain transactions, LN transactions aren't limited to a scarce amount of block space. The actual costs of routing a payment is near zero and the utility of a cheap network may even create many nodes without a fee altogether.


Yes, it's painfully obvious. Look at their fee schedule - while BCH and BTC are both clearing at 1 sat/b they impose a somewhat hefty "network fee" on BTC while BCH remains free. 
Them being "anti Bitcoin Core" (which post fork turned into anti Bitcoin) is not exactly news worthy.
Thankfully the community is building around them and they will be replaced for Bitcoin transactions unless they stop conducting their business like high school girls with a grudge (perhaps they will be replaced anyways).

Meh, might be nitpicky but I wouldn't say "blockchain tech" is secure by definition, this is the sort of misunderstandings that leads to private blockchains. A PoW blockchain is only secure if it is sufficiently decentralized AND has a large amount of hashing power consistently directed to mining it.


This is just all sorts of wrong. Visa is obviously not a blockchain nor is it an immutible ledger that sets in stone every 30 seconds. Visa would be more like a blockchain with a 6 month block time (or whatever the deadline on chargebacks is). Also, a shorter block time means less security pr. block and a plethora of other potential security compromises.

You are correct but as any order can be pulled at any moment this data is not as meaningful as it could seem.

Diversifying into alts to mitigate downside risk doesn't make much sense when they clearly tank twice as hard as Bitcoin when it has a violent correction. Diversification into legacy markets would make more sense if I was worried about my exposure to Bitcoin.
I do hold a small amount of alts (&lt;10%) no ETH though. All the alts I've been holding (perhaps with one exception) has been with the sole purpose of accumulating more BTC and I don't think I'm the only one who feels that way. Before SW lock-in I was ~50% in BTC. Now the scaling deadlock is over and I'm trending towards 100%.

Yup, I can appreciate how difficult it must be figuring out what's what as a newer person in this space. A lot of history to read up on and a lot of different interpretations of said history.
The best thing you can do is stay skeptical, especially when people start exaggerating/misrepresenting evidence and stating their theories as fact.
Another good idea I’d say, is to stop trying to find the truth on written media alone. Listen to presentations, interviews, discussions and podcasts. It’s far more easy and low-risk to write an 800-paragraph convincingly laid out blogpost on why some person or institution, is trying to accomplish X, Y and Z.

Better than the business that does everything it can to drive users away from Bitcoin and over to BCH, including misrepresenting their own fee as "network fee", yes I think so.


Settling on-chain after each tx is obviously retarded on LN and if you stay off chain, those multiple hops are obviously way cheaper than on chain txs.

I'm excited by the prospect of provably scarce person to person currency that is not controlled by private or national banks.

There will be no naked shorting, so someone would have to buy the contracts and be willing to lend them out before anyone would be able to go short. 
The contracts are fully collaterized and physically settled so in order to create more of them LedgerX would have to buy up BTC on exchanges and OTC markets pushing up prices.
This is bullish as fuck.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:47:41
I highly doubt that the SW2X will win out to begin with but even if it somehow did changing the coin supply would be MUCH more contentious than changing the block size, saying "both requires hard forks so since a hard fork happened here both could easily happen" is just a terrible argument.
If the legacy chain survives your argument actually supports it as being a proven "hard to change" cryptocurrency. I guess we then should see value go from alts into Bitcoin by your same line of reasoning?

Buying after a ~40% correction can't be terrible. It might go down 50% or even 60% but a lot of bears never got in on the last bullrun because they bought in to all the FUD pre AUG 1st or even before.

Thinking it would be as easy to destroy Bitcoin as amassing majority hashing is where your lack of understanding shines through.

Either we avoid SW2X altogether which removes uncertainty and could cause a decent price spike. Or we defeat the SW2X and in doing so prove that Bitcoin is pretty much impossible for any coalition to control against the will of the users, no matter their hashing power and industry influence. The second option could likely lead to price decrease short-mid term.
Now I'm not really entertaining the idea of SW2X not being defeated by miners being forced to return to legacy Bitcoin by financial incentives. I think it's incredibly unlikely given:
* Current user sentiment on various social media (I know this isn't worth much on it's own)
* Current futures prices ("unfair" contracts can't explain 85% vs. 15% no matter how much Jeff Garzik would like for that to be the case) 
* Almost unanimous dev support by the top devs in the space backing the legacy chain
* The businesses/miners backing SW2X are much more reliant on revenue and can't afford being ideologues to near the same extend.
There are probably more good reasons I'm overlooking.
Unless I'm greatly mistaken, my point is; 
**Whether or not SW2X implodes pre-fork, it doesn't really matter long term for the hodlers/users.**
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:28:52
So, at 100% SW adoption Bitcoin should be at 0.45 + (0.14/0.17 * 1) = 127.35% of the total Crypto market.

We have every right to state our opinion on their stance. And XAPO might've been a great company but the amount of stupidity in that announcement proves them to be technically incompetent or outright disingenuous, or both.
Do you think Flip-flopping the BTC ticker to whatever has majority hashrate is a great idea? Let's say the miners go through with it and B2X is at 90% hashrate and at a price of $1000. Suddenly "BTC" dropped 80% in value. Then as miners get greedy (they will and they should) and hashpower gradually starts going back to the legacy chain they swap the ticker again at &gt;50%.
Do you think all the noobs buying cheap "BTC" only to be left with an altcoin will appreciate this?

I think it's hard for something like that to be baked into price completely. It's essentially a new channel for purchasing so added demand for the underlying asset (Bitcoin) should continually help support and push up the price. It's not a one-time event.

This x100. 
I am not too heavy into alts but I did used to use ShapeShift and thought it was a great product (with good support when issues arose).
However, I feel our boycott of companies like ShapeShift and BitPay won't at all be noticed due to the insane growth the crypto-space as a whole is experiencing these days. It's still obviously better to "vote with your wallet" than not, but it's frustrating that old customers leaving will likely be drowned out in the vast amount of new customers that probably have no knowledge of or opinion on these issues.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:57:57
The miners have already proven with BCH that they are only loyal to their bottom line. This, of course is perfectly fine but it proves their signaling should not be trusted. If the split happens and the market chooses legacy Bitcoin as the "real" Bitcoin, guess what they will soon be mining..
Having a select few business owners and the Chinese "head of mining" decide on protocol implementations is a great way to destroy one of the most important value propositions of Bitcoin. With BCH in existence, a decent gradual improvement in throughput on BTC due to SW and less pressure from obvious spam attacks the arguments for 2X are pretty much down to "because we agreed". 
Pretty damn stupid to cling to an agreement when it is by the day becoming more and more obvious that it is *extremely* contentious and will most certainly be a net negative for everyone involved. It will split the network effects, cause all sorts of confusion and obstacles in new adoption and most likely leave two chains with way more throughput capacity than they need for a very long time.
Not adapting out of pride after it became clear as day that it would be a train wreck, I think will be Barry Silbert and the rest of the powerful SW2X supporters greatest mistake when we look back on these "early years" of Bitcoin a long time from now.
It should be clear that it's a terrible idea when you have full-fledged BCH pumpers (Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and Ryan X. Charles to mention a few - just look at their twitter feeds if you think I'm exaggerating) cheering the fork on. They would like nothing better than to have a divide in Bitcoin that further obscures what the "real Bitcoin" is. An opportunity for them to jump in and try to claim that title. It has already begun, at first it seemed they all agreed BCH was an altcoin but now "Bitcoin Cash IS Bitcoin" is slowly becoming their mantra.
I still have hope that cooler heads could prevail and this train wreck could be avoided altogether (or made much less devastating by two-way replay protection). Even if it seems unlikely now I think it's becoming clear that a large part of the community is starting to speak up against this unnecessarily reckless hard fork. This gives me hope that even if it does happen, the honey badger will brush it off and those of us who feel inclined will have another great opportunity to sell this new coin for more Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-18 17:52:43
The more effefctive way of doing a state sponsored attack on the Bitcoin network, would be if current hashing power was taken over. China really is the only nation that could feasibly do this now, by seizing all the large-scale mining operation and production facilities. And I’m not sure it’ll be that for long.
It would still be a huge operation and it would always be a PoW change away from being neutered completely but at least the investment and roll-out time is smaller and risk of the ASIC miners produced ending up supporting the network (which is otherwise very real) is avoided.
It would halt the network and trust would be lost in transacting on it but peoples balances would be fine and it would by no means destroy Bitcoin. Frankly, I think there's a case to be made for it strengthening it longer term due to the attention it would bring and the added feather to the cap this newly proven resilience would provide.
While a 51% attack certainly is not a joke, people *way* overestimate the destructive effect it could have.
The only practical way a state can attack Bitcoin is fiat on-ramps, and this is obviously by no means an airtight seal. Which really isn't an attack on the network, only on the citizens affected.

What makes you think a 51% attack would "take it down"?
Building more Bitcoin ASIC miners is probably the worst way of trying to stop Bitcoin. Incredibly expensive, pretty much impossible to hide production at that scale and you risk being left with bricked hardware or hardware supporting the Bitcoin network.

Yup, I think these pockets of delusion will only grow bigger as Bitcoin does. It’s sad watching some of them slowly morph from Bitcoiners into altcoiners and then into fully fledged buttcoiners shouting “SW is malicious code and LN is centralized vaporware”. I’m even starting to see the old and tired “tulip bulb mania” references from some of them.
Admitting to themselves that they were wrong would be acknowledging how much wealth their decision to buy into the bullshit cost them and that will only become harder as Bitcoin appreciates in value.
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:52:28
We JUST had a potential ~2x blocksize increase in SegWit. Most of the companies pushing this highly contentious hard fork has not even implemented SW transactions yet. If they really were concerned about on-chain throughput and transaction fees they would start using SW transactions.
It is clearly an attempt by a few powerful figures to unseat the open source community Bitcoin Core from developement and replace them with something that they have control over.
A 2x hard fork might very well become necesarry but it surely isn't now, without user and developer support just because some CEOs signed an agreement.
Even if what they were pushing was sound, they are doing it in an unsound manner that will disrupt the network effect of Bitcoin and cause mass confusion and loss of funds. And in the end we will probably be left with a SW2X coin that is dead because miners can't keep throwing opportunity costs of mining Bitcoin away indefinitely and it has no EDA like BCH. Everyone loses.
If they REALLY want big blocks and more centralized developement, they already have BCH. It's incredibly obvious that this is another stupid attempt to have Bitcoin Core follow orders or get "fired" and it's even more obvious that it won't work.

@_date: 2017-10-19 15:31:07
So you don't think node count or miner centralization matter? Or do you think it won't be affected in any meaningful way by going to 8MB max blockweight? 
You act like there are no consequences at all, no security trade-offs to consider, no need to bundle other hard fork requiring protocol improvements in to increase consensus and decrease the amount of potential disruptive network splits going forward.
I agree that the scaling deadlock was extremely frustrating but after such a long time of nothing happening we *finally* got a block size increase in SegWit, not letting that play out a bit and jumping on a HF with almost no dev or user support, that came to be like it did, is just a terrible choice in my opinion.

Actually, for thousands of years they didn't, unbacked fiat currencies is a fairly new phenomenon only a century old or so.


Everything is always something until it isn't that thing, this is hardly an argument. Can you explain *why* you think decentralization will decrease to a point where goverments could should it down? Increased costs of running a full node? 
I think you're underestimating the resiliency of the technology and the gametheory involved between states. You mention "the govt" decides to ban/regulate it and I assume you are referring to USA. I'll remind you that there is a whole world outside of that, some of which has already regulated it, treating it like a currency and some have already banned it. What makes you think the US (if that is indeed what you meant) would succeed in killing Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:56:02
I think it's natural that the spikes decrease as the system grows and the value they create becomes increasingly more tempting to at least partially take out for the individual investors.
$1-30 was 30x.
$120-$1200 was 10x.
If you look at the weekly chart you can argue this current "semi" parabolic move started ~$1000 or somewhere between $1900 and $3k. 5x of that leaves us with a broad range of $5-15k. 
The argument against this being a smaller spike is the very long consolidation leading up to it and that institutional money is a new paradigm with much "stronger hands". No longer nerds looking at numbers on a screen thinking "Jesus christ, that $ could change my life".
All I know is that hodling through the boom and bust cycles is probably the best (and by far least stressful) approach, as long as you believe in the fundamentals.

I agree that is not a utopia, anyone can fall into the same trap of being too much on "the team" to look at things in an objective fashion. I just feel like the situation is a lot better. People seem to care about scaling Bitcoin rather than exposing "Blockstream Core".
Roger Ver clearly has behaved like a slimy politician and you don't need to delve into wild conspiracies to see it. Here's a short list off the top of my head:
* He has consistently been capping blocks @ 750kB or 1MB since SW activation on his mining pool (I thought he wanted bigger blocks, but I guess what he's selling depend on Bitcoin fees being high). The very same SW he helped block for as long as he could btw.
* He has deliberately been sending overly expensive transactions to use in his "LOOK AT THE FEES!" campaign on social media.
* Now he has aligned himself with the obvious fraud that is Craig Wright and is selling BCH as "Bitcoin", trying to profit from the confusion.
There are many more examples. Like the case seems to be with many posters, his main priority isn't to lower transaction fees, it's to get rid of Bitcoin Core.
Even if he thinks he's ultimately doing something good and that the ends justify the means, his behavior is incredibly deceitful and manipulative, and he deserves to be scorned for it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:18:56
It could have been 80% by now and they'd find a way to turn it into a failure. 
Everything is spun to fit the narrative. Most of the posters are far removed from any self-reflection or honesty. It's about coming together and getting an outlet for their deep hatred for and Bitcoin Core. 
Objectivity can be inconvenient.

The tweet was explicitly about "hodling bitcoin"; resisting the urge to sell the peaks and valleys. 
He never claimed this was a "realistic scenario" that most people would succeed in so your critique seem misplaced.
It's like posting "most people can't do that!" to a post about "Climbing Mount Everest is to reject the limits of humanity".
And there are many people that managed to hold onto most of their Bitcoin, bought at way lower prices than $13. Not a high % of people but nonetheless not an unrealistic scenario for everyone.

Blatant lie. 
Bitcoin Core had SegWit developed and ready to implement for ages. It IS a step to scale, both short term and long term. All that without requiring a hard fork. The fact that it was blocked for so long (and is still being held back) by many of the very same people who are now cheering on SW2X should make it clear that their agenda went beyond a mere throughput increase.
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:08:40
Finally a statement from you that I can wholeheartedly get behind.

I'd say disrupt rather than stop, stopping it entirely/permanently seems like a cat and mouse game that is hard for any nation state (or coalition) to win barring unrealistic scenarios (world wide internet shut off, prison sentences for anyone running nodes/using it by all nations etc.)

* A bad precedent of bailing out people trusting shitty smart contracts 
* A crazy amount of ICO money being raised, a lot of grand promises but little in terms of those revolutionizing dapps 
* A prospective move to the "it might work in theory" PoS system
* Huge reliance on one central figurehead (even if mostly PR wise)
* Had to force in an unnecesarry ICO token in order to fund scaling developement

Not in the last 1000 blocks. 
I exported the data from  into Excel and sorted it after total txs. Block  is by far the one with the most txs at 3706 in total and 2803 (!!) SW txs. Somewhat ironically it was mined by Antpool ;)
To put the number into perspective: 
The block with the second highest amount of txs in that dataset was block  with 3183 txs in total and 391 SW txs.
The blocks contained an average of 1927 txs in total and 240 SW txs.

SW getting to 100% of it's potential is dependant on the whole network upgrading. Sure. The part of the network that has isssues with spending a lot on fees are already and will become increasingly more incentivized to upgrade when fees become an issue for them. Not utilizing SW while screaming "think of the fees!" is logically inconsistent.


So because it was not solely a scaling solution but a solved other issues as well, that is somehow a bad thing? 


I agree on there being a long tail of the last 5-10% adopting SW tx's, but I'm more optimistic that this will be more similar to the "easeInOutQuint" graph above the one you predicted. 100% might never happen, but that doesn't make it less of a scaling solution. How soon we will get to 90%+ will mostly depend on actual throughput demand. 


Sure, just please spare me the "This is why LN is centralized vaporware" blogposts.

I can appreciate a company in this space with the guts to take a clear stance on this instead of staying neutral or supporting it.
Companies like BitMex, Samourai Wallet and Bitfinex will keep my business going forward. It doesn't hurt that they genuinly provide some of (if not the) best services in their respective fields. Perhaps there's a correlation between having tech people (who I think is more likely to oppose 2X) running the company and providing a great product :P
I know that Bitfinex (as far as I'm aware are yet to completely denounce SW2X) but being the first to give us a futures contracts market is IMO a huge deal. I think it have had a massive effect on defusing FUD in the market and probably part of the reason why the price is as high as it is currently.

I think 18-8% is pretty damn significant given the effective throughput cap has been smaller for 8 years and in deadlock for ~4.
And as throughput/fees become more of an issue the incentives to utilizte SW transactions goes up. It's like a release valve. 
Now we only need the companies that are so public in wanting a throughput increase to start actually doing what they can to get it.

You can split 1 BTC manually into 1 BT1 and 1 BT2 token. Then you can sell the one you don't believe in and buy the one you do believe in for the proceeds.
At any point you can remerge an equal amount of B1X and B2X tokens into back into BTC and if the fork happens you will obviously get the tokens swapped for relevant coins after they split them.

They are either completely off their rocker, people paid to upvote anything anti Core or a good mix of both.
Expecting them to see I was making fun of the ridiculous claims, I wrote something like the following in a post about how SW was terrible:


It then got *heavily* upvoted and some thought leader literally came in and responded to my post telling people not to upvote it because I was a troll. 
It could be that they are "legitimate" conspiracy nuts willing to believe anything anti Core, but it also sure would suck to see the upvotes you've paid for, undermine what they were supposed to accomplish by highlighting sarcastic posts made to discredit the wildly unfounded conspiracies and lies.

A big bonus is the practicality of not having to plan ahead and sell in bulk. 
Want to splurge a bit with your Bitcoin profits but have no idea how much you'll end up spending? Just use a card, you're guaranteed not to end up bag-holding fiat or having to call it a night early.
The expected loss in purchasing power of having your funds sitting in dirty fiat, is probably greater than the additional fees you end up paying anyway.

@_date: 2017-10-19 14:23:24


So, practicality for daily transactions is way more important and innovative than the ability to opt out of exposure to fiat money and government control by being able to store wealth in an unseizable asset? I get that you want "electronic p2p cash" (so do I) but if you think being a payment network is **everything** Bitcoin brings to the table you haven't dug deep enough.
People aren't saying it won't *ever* be practical and useful for small and frequent payments, however wanting it to do *everything* for *everyone* from day one will quickly lead to it **not** doing anything exciting at all. 
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, scaling might feel slow and painful but considering the potential impact of doing so successfully, sacrificing the coffee purchases for a year or two, sure seems like a small trade-off.

Even so, it's not like the upgrade isn't worth anything before it hits 100%. It's a steady and gradual increase in throughput that is already at a very meaningful level today.
If his quote was "SW getting to 100% will take years", he might very well be correct but it would be a rather meaningless point to make in the first place.
It was incredibly how some of those guys spent months on the "SW doesn't scale fast enough, we need bigger blocks NOW so let's not do SegWit". 
It must have required some serious logical flexibility to have been posting the "tx fees are THIS high we desperately need more capacity!" with one hand while trying to stop a soft fork that would indeed do so with the other.
Now they seem to be juggling the similarly incompatible "SW killed Bitcoin only BCash is worthy" and "SW2X is the real Bitcoin" narratives. It's a sight to behold.

Even if all the allegations are true, it still seems like an absolute injustice that he got the sentence he did for the crimes he was charged for. 
Regardless of simpleton "He's a POS and should rot in jail" arguments, I think everyone deserves a fair trial and sentencing. I don't think 2x life + 40 years w/o parole for the crimes he was charged with was close to that. 
Based on what you write, if his initial sentencing hadn't been absolutely bonkers, he would've had the opportunity of a trial if the charges you mentioned were indeed upheld. That would've been a more reasonable due process (without making any claims as to whether he was obviously framed or obviously guilty).
You seem rather quick to dismiss any possible legitimacy of factors that put Ross in a better light, while without hesitation accepting everything that paints him in the worst light possible as undeniable fact.
I'm not saying Ross was a Saint or the second coming of Satoshi that everyone interested in Bitcoin is indebted to - I have no idea. However, the sentencing seems massively out of proportion, even by American standards. Your seeming inability to give any such acknowledgments, makes you look like someone who is more interested in personal vendettas than truth or justice.
At the end of the day, I'm glad to not live in a country where something like this is possible. Celebrating a miscarriage of justice with "He was a monster, so it's good  is embracing some seriously disgusting mob mentality.

You wrote that Bitcoin Core wren't taking any steps to scale. That is a lie just like SegWit not being a blocksize increase is a lie.

Yea, It's the cost of having a more decentralized system. I do think obvious threats will achive near-consensus more quickly.
I also think a hard fork to a bigger block size will have much wider consensus amongst users and especially devs when we have seen SW adoption start to top out, depending on the throughput/fee situation then, other potential advancements and empirical research done in the mean time.
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:26:36
So Bitcoin Core is the "loud ass bro" with stupid suggestions that you go through with because you don't bother arguing?
And how is SW *not* a scaling solution on par with a 2x block size increase? It's pretty much the same increase in throughput we will see when we reach broader adoption (already at 10%). 
You might say "it will take ages for everyone to upgrade" but thankfully, it is incentive-aligned in the way that the more expensive transactions become the more economical incentive there will be to upgrading. It also allow for trustless second layer protocols which in the long term is a MUCH more viable way of scaling to mass adoption without compromising security of the base layer.

I have thought for myself and come to the conclusion that BCH is a centralized shitcoin, controlled by a few people and a bunch of shills who bought into the whole "Blockstream Core" conspiracy.
When you have to use moderation policy of a privately owned subreddit as argument in a technical discussion, you know your arguments are shit.
I've seen both sides and chosen to align with the one that has the actual development talent, the people who were building this tech way before Roger became the first "Bitcoin investor" and still are focused on code rather than social media campaigns, ICOs or whatever they think will make them rich.
It's fine to disagree on "adoption first" or "decentralization first" (what the small blocker vs. big blocker debate *actually* comes down to), but the amount of bullshit political propaganda spewed by guys like Roger, it's pretty clear that dude is way past reasonable and honest discussion. Like most of his devote followers seem to be.

If you don't even believe there will be a hf you probably shouldn't buy BT2 tokens.

I think there are a lot of opinion and flippantly drawn conclusions in that post. 
Even if you are absolutely correct and all the worries about a further ~doubling of the max potential blocksize are completely unfounded - hard forking the protocol because 20 guys in a private meeting agreed to do so is a terrible precedent. 
Disregarding the debates about block size and given this precedent alone, it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that it is a highly contentious "upgrade" that will likely result in the creation of an altcoin with less market value if seen through.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:13:01
You are becomming increasingly more reasonable to me. Maybe I was a bit harsh in my initial response - I'm just tired of the nonsense "SW isn't scaling" or "SW isn't a blocksize increase" bullshit that was campaigned for before lock-in and still is in some delusional corners of the internet.
In regards to your critisicm of LN I don't really view it from the same perspective. At least initially, it's a means of off-boarding medium-small transactions from the main chain, if blocks aren't full not a lot of people will need to use LN (although it will still make sense for micro tx's), as the blocks become fuller and fees increase more tx's will make find their way to 2nd layers as the equilibrium adjusts.
It's about making BTC payments more commercially viable without compromizing the security of the entire network or requiring a hard fork that would potentially disrupt the network effects. And no, this does not mean we can NEVER hard fork with a block size increase.

I think it's more so to counter the wild exaggerations that is constantly thrown around about fees. Often caused by overpaying.
And saying "your coin is broken" due to high fees is kind of an oxymoronic statement. If it really was broken people would hardly be willing to pay the fees required for transactions and the fee levels would decline as a result.
Perhaps not everyone has small purchase viability as their  concern.

Right, SW is gradual increase where further adoption is like a release valve to high throughput demand on the Bitcoin blockchain. 
And it doesn't: 
* Force any low bandwith nodes off the network 
* Increase orphan rate or miner centralization
* Require a hard fork (that can be very damaging to the network without consensus)
AND it fixes malleability allowing for trustless second layer protocols to be deployed. 
It almost sounds too good to be true. SW really is more than on par with a mere 2x of the blocksize. Crazy that it took so long for us to get it!

In my post above I'm explicitly referring to the loud conspiracy-happy anti "Blockstream Core" people who would upvote a post like the one I made. 
I do agree that there are *some* genuine "big blockers" on that have logical integrity and refuse to:
* Jump to wild conspiracies
* Use obvious out-of-context quotes
* Misrepresent or outright lie about technical details
(All done unashamedly to drive opinion and bolster their side of the argument).
The sentence of mine you are quoting here was used in response to a guy who unfairly assessed that because my ideas on scaling generally aligns with so would my thoughts on proper moderation.
I *don't* think bundling together everyone who believes my sarcastic post to be clear-cut truth and describing them as being "off their rocker" is manipulative at all. 
Just like how I feel about bundling together all flat earthers as being crazy. What *would* be manipulative is bundeling together all Americans as such because a large portion of flat earthers are American (not sure if that's true but just pretend it is for the analogy to make sense).
I apologize if it came across as describing *everyone* who posts on I only meant the loud and vote-happy portion that seem completely blinded by their hatred towards anything Core. And to be frank, the sub seem to have spiraled down that path a bit as loud loonies drive away the more reflecting and honest posters.

Actually buying Bitfinex equity when offered at the start of May has outperformed BTC so far.
Q2 dividend + latest buy offer on the shares has yielded a combined 260% ROI (not including taxes) while Bitcoin "only" yielded ~190% ROI for the same period ($1600 -&gt; $4300 + $360 for BCH).
The gap will probably widen when the Ifinex shares start trading more freely (only very large current Bitfinex investors are able to buy for now and thus the offers are sort of "lowballs") but eventually I suspect the honey badger will get back ahead ;)

On the other hand, surviving such a "contentious fork attack" with majority hashing power miners and some of the most influential businessmen in the space would be indescribably bullish. Even if the price could dump short-medium term, Bitcoin surviving this would strongly dissuade others from trying it going forward as well as minimize the FUD that would be associated with any future attempts.
So, while NO2X and $7k Bitcoin by November would be great. $3-4k Bitcoin and a more battle-proven honey badger wouldn't be the worst outcome either. I would obviously prefer not dealing with the drama and risks if I had to choose.

Those newly forked tokens won't be transactable on the Bitcoin network and they won't be secured by the hashing power.

As they won't delude the tokens that can be transacted on the Bitcoin network, it's ridiculous to view them as inflation.

Depending on the definition of M1, I'm fairly sure this would only normally include physical cash. Which is far from the entire money supply. I know in Denmark ~~M1~~ M0 is ~6% of all DKK the rest only exists digitally. This percentage is probably higher in the countries in the headline but the distinction remains.
I do agree it starts to hit home in a bigger way and that it is much more relevant than a comparison to the yearly GDP of a certain country. But I wouldn't call it "entire contries monetary worth" - not quite yet, anyways ;)
EDIT: I was wrong in thinking that M1 was only physical fiat, it's actually a lot more than that, though how much more depends on which countries definition you go by.

Bitcoin is many different things to many different people. One of them is an investment in the technology. Some people feel better not being responsible for the private keys or just trust their bank to do a better job securing them than they could (I do realize this is not exactly the case here).
Stuff like this and further developement in hardware wallets will help make bitcoin accessible to people who don't know what the difference is between a tablet and an ipad.

You have a narrow view of what money is. Obviously, nobody HODLs $5 bills expecting increased purchasing power, however this isn't necessarily true with non-fiat moneys.
[Here's an infographic]( that explains the 3 main properties of money.
* Store of Value (SoV)
* Medium of Exchange (MoE)
* Unit of Account (UoA)
The computer science breakthrough of Bitcoin is trustless digital scarcity, this allows Bitcoin to have properties similar to gold with a finite supply (but with a much more well-defined emission curve and cap). Realistically, most people here don't have a lot of issues using their national currency as MoE and obviously as UoA. However, all fiat money (some by orders of magnitude more) are terrible long term SoV's, by design. This is where Bitcoin is unique and why many prefer the analogy of "digital gold" to something like "stateless dollar".
People keep having these misguided views that Bitcoin has failed because we don't see broad use in commerce, this mostly because of the term "crypto currency". They fail to see that while more use in commerce would be cool, it's not the killer app at all and not the natural first step for an organically appearing new money.

We also have to remember that the global money supply (M3) is not fixed at $60 trillion. In fact, it has been growing fairly rapidly since it's been estimated. 
Some estimates puts it at 300% growth over the last 20 years. So perhaps if one Bitcoin ever gets to $1M, then the total amount of M3 might be $200 trillion thus Bitcoin would "only" need to make up 10% of it.

Probably like $700K-$800K of todays $ due to inflation. It's not like inflation rates in the US has increased wildly. Actually they are on the [low end]( of the average over the last 50 years.
Of course, USD might be less valuable compared to other national currencies, but if you're hoping the entire US economy is going to collapse in the next 10 years or that Bitcoin will be mostly used instead of the $ I think you'll be dissapointed.
With that said, I am super bullish on Bitcoin and don't think we need anything quite that drastic to reach a huge increase in value.

Yup, I can't wait for this shit to be done with. At least it's nice to see the premium go down and some of the panic subside as they clearly had no issues providing the cryptocurrency people wanted to withdraw. 
I do believe that they're telling the truth about being solvent and banks being the issue with wires. Although communication could have been better I still think that people will have complaints no matter what they say. Obviously, they are put to a higher standard and scrutinized more than other exchanges due to the hack. Still, to some degree I can't help but feel at least part of the "I can't believe anyone does business there" and "Gox 2.0" comments could be done by competitors or with some other nefarious motivation - but it's hard to determine.
No matter the outcome I'm looking forward to get some sort of "closure" here. I just hope that the majority of the FUD will stop if the audit shows their claims to be true - but I'm sure that won't satisfy everyone.

I honestly think a good amount of them are actively spreading FUD about bitcoin to help their "flippening". It could be that most of the anti "Blockstream Core" are actually just trying to hold bitcoin back for this reason. I don't wanna get too conspiratorial but it would explain their unwillingness to consider the strong evidence in cases like asicboost.
It's especially sad because they're probably fighting against their own interest by scaring some people away from cryptocurrenecy entirely. If you go to some of their echo chamber subs comments like "bitcoin and ethereum can both thrive with different use cases" will actually get downvoted and argued tirelessly, seems like some of them are getting a bit of delusions of grandeur with their "Ethereum will run the world".
The most annoying thing is that it becomes almost impossible to tell the legitimate "big blockers" from the imposters.

That's more of a theoretical view on how dividends should not be a thing and I agree completely in most cases (as long as the company is expanding and have good use of the capital). However, in the real world a lot large companies (esp. in certain sectors) pay a dividend that mostly equates to any share appreciation thus making the dividend payout the actual investment gains.
I was just trying to point out that dividends not being meaningful for stock gains in as a general rule is just plain false rather than arguing whether or not the concept itself is illogical.

You need to stop trusting whatever Roger says. He is a very manipulative person. Some people working for Blockstream (which is different from the community of open source devs contributing to Bitcoin Core) has probably expressed a sentiment similar to "Bitcoin is not ready for 6 billion people today and we shouldn't compromise the fundamental values in order to please impatient business owners" - but when you're agenda driven politician like Roger Ver, context is your enemy.
Scaling to world wide adoption is not a sprint but rather a marathon, if you go out sprinting your odds of finishing decreases dramatically.
If you think all Roger Ver cares about is scaling Bitcoin to 6 billion people then it would be prudent to ask yourself why he has helped stall SegWit implementation for so long. You're not scaling to 6 billion people without second layers and the longer it takes to viably be able to create those, the longer it will take to fulfill that vision.

A new money will never become SoV, MoE and UoA from day one, it's a lengthy process and Bitcoin has already come far from being a fringe "fun collectible" for nerds to being considered judgement and censorship resistant store of value and inflation hedge by a lot of people. 
Digital gold I think is the best analogy of what it is slowly becoming - it's obviously the early days and price volatility is unavoidable. Nothing grows like Bitcoin has grown in a linear fashion, it's simply impossible with human psychology.
People generally think way too much in USD price terms and miss the exciting part: Bitcoins emission curve. 
This is the first ever experiment in practically unstoppable and verifiable, extreme digital scarcity. It's unlike anything we've seen before it, so it is hard to make sense of intuitively. I think if people forgot about the price in USD completely, backed up and tried not to bring their preconceived ideas of money with them, detractors that are honest with themselves would find themselves a lot less cocksure in declaring it an inevitable failure.
This is what I think, I know there are no guarantees in investing or in life in general. I'm not going to try to convince you that Bitcoin can be sound money, it's fine that you disagree. I don't think Bitcoin will become less polarizing anytime soon, but it doesn't really need to be that to succeed. It just need an inflow of people with without deeply entrenched ideas, ask some fundamental questions about money and come to a similar conclusion that many have already, that this is a huge improvement over fiat moneys. The vehement detractors chomping at the bit to call it a failure and declare it dead, has if anything, been very helpful in spreading it due to the Streisand effect.
I'll leave you with an article from early 2014 that counters the "you need to spend your Bitcoins to help grow the ecosystem, "hodling"/hoarding it is bad", it's a fun read, fairly concise and it should at the very least help you understand the logic of "hodlers of last resort" and how SoV predates MoE.

You're gravely mistaken if those are the ideas you think I am mocking. 
What I am mocking is the insisting on scaling Bitcoin linearly (on the base layer) and doing so without consideration of the drawbacks. I am mocking the emotional rhetoric people like Roger Ver use to muddy the waters and make technical people look like greedy elitists.
I still believe in the "vision" you describe. But I also believe Bitcoin is still in it's infancy and over the last 5 years we have learned a lot about the difficulty of scaling blockchains that nobody knew. Not utilizing that knowledge would be a betrayel to a scientific approach. 
And if you *really* care about 6 billion people being able to use Bitcoin and you still think it should be done without second layers then I have a hard time taking your opinion seriously. Because what you will end up with might have room for a lot of transactions, but it will compromise some of the most important core values of Bitcoin. That is what is being mocked here.

Accepting Bitcoin opens up a company to more potential customers. Incentive is directly correlated to adoption as well as transaction costs. It could also save the business a lot of money if we get some well functioning second layer solutions implemented (It costs them quite a bit to take VISA)
The incentives of consumers to use Bitcoin is the exact same as using any other currency, if it's what they have and the need certain goods - that's what they have to use to pay for them. If you're a big believer in Bitcoin there would be no reason to hold any fiat, and if you don't hold any fiat but do hold Bitcoin - you're gonna use Bitcoin when you purchase something.

To me, it's perfectly fair that people get rewarded for being lucky enough to get exposed to Bitcoin, clever enough to understand its potential impact and brave enough to risk some of their capital. 
Also, the fact that it's a financially empowering technology makes it a positive for almost everybody in the long run, even (perhaps especially) the late adopters.

I think that's the narrative non-believers like to tell themselves, "it's all dumb money, greedy and gullible fucks buying something they have no idea what is to try to 10x their USD". I just don't think it's the truth.
Sure, a substantial portion of buyers, when it gets really frothy (as in late 2013 and late 2017) are absolutely these types of people, but I think a lot of them aren’t and for each hype cycle, more people “get it” and become holders longer term and start engaging in learning and building the ecosystem rather than looking at charts.


There is always going to be a lot of price hype, people will celebrate it going up or try to get others to buy in. This is unavoidable. I tend to think the unscientific idiots gravitate to altcoins mostly. Especially the new ones claiming to be Bitcoin 3.0 etc.


I agree, there are a lot of memes and shitposting here, but I don't think that's systemic to Bitcoin, there is plenty of technical discussion going on if you seek it out (there's a world outside of r/bitcoin). If you are only judging the Bitcoin community from a single subreddit, you won't get a good picture. I personally prefer twitter because I can follow people that have proven to be rational and intelligent (whether I agree with them or not) and if discussion degenerates too much into dumb shit it's easy to curate.


That's a false dilemma, wanting to increase your own purchasing power is perfectly compatible with wanting to see a monetary revolution. The genius of Bitcoin is that either will do.


Noobs who try to trade this stuff surely will get fleeced. Hopefully they learn from that and stop trying to trade and just hold whatever they can afford to lose. Thankfully, I think most people learn from their mistakes.


That's the whole idea, Bitcoin is probably the closest thing you can get to an actual free market doing its thing.


Okay. If people worry that we're in a bubble they are probably over levered or buying for the wrong reasons (short term USD speculation).
There's a lot of "think of the children" going on with some of these arguments, as if Bitcoin will burglarize people and it's a travesty that they aren't protected. At the end of the day buying Bitcoin is voluntary, I'm a fan of personal responsibility, learning from mistakes and helping spread sound investment advice (with Bitcoin TL;DR: buy only for what you can afford to lose and prepare yourself for volatility).

Bitcoin doesn't really have any inherent advantages that makes it more practical to actually pay with (other than possibly cheaper). If you think Bitcoins killer app is being able to buy stuff easier at the cash register than with credit cards or other fintech solutions, you need to do some reading.
With that said, it doesn't have any inherent disadvantages either everything done on Apple Pay can be built to be done with BTC. We're perhaps hours away from locking in Segwit that opens up for a lot of exciting stuff in this area. Patience is key ;)

What a crock of shit, altcoin salesman interpretation. 
The more honest and reasonable take would be that people believe censorship resistance is important, the ability to run a full node is crucial in achieving this and that massively increasing the block size will diminish this ability and cripple the ability for Bitcoin to withstand attacks long term.
Now, there is *some* reason to celebrate the total amount of on-chain fees as we already know that a fee-market in the long term is necessary to secure the chain once the block subsidy diminishes significantly. Empirically observing the longterm viability of this is a great confidence boost that Bitcoin is viable long term. You are straw-manning the shit out of this argument though, just like Roger did with his bullshit slide decks and "small blockers hate babies and poor people" nonsense.
Bootstrapping a new decentralized money through open-source development is not done with the flick of a wrist, it's a multi-decade effort. You may hate the digital gold/SoV meme, but that will naturally be what comes first with layered scaling, not on-chain frappuccinos for 7B people. Impatience will leave you with centralized "like Bitcoin but better" shitcoins trending to zero, that never mentions trade-offs of those cheap/fast transactions.

They also just did a report (at the peak of the fee-bubble) about how impractible and expensive it was to live completely off of Bitcoin in NYC (transacting only on the main chain). Basically "buying coffee with Bitcoin for a week".

He said in 5 years. That's a LONG ASS TIME in a this space. How did the eco system look 5 years ago? 5 years is more than enough for second layers to be functioning seemlessly and allow for throughput to scale exponentially and fees (esp. on small txs) to become insignificant. It's obviously not a guarantee but this is a "bold prediction" not a "sure thing".
I do agree that it seems unlikely that countries with extreme poverty will be first movers but probably not due to fees.

I think people are displaying schadenfreude mainly toward Jihan Wu and the company that has seemingly done everything in their power to work against Bitcoin and node/user/market consensus. 
If anything this is a celebration of empirically observed antifragility of Bitcoin. It doesn't matter if you're Coinbase, Bitmain or a coalition of extremely wealthy and influential individuals, you won't control Bitcoin and if you double down on trying to do so it will probably have terrible long term economic consequences.
Jihan had plenty of opportunities to come to terms with reality of Bitcoin and focus on doing what he (at one point) did best; create efficient ASIC miners. His ego and hunger for power got in the way and as a result he mismanaged his company in a spectacular way by completely ditching Bitcoin and going all in on BCH. 
That said, I'm sure he's still a very wealthy man, so you shouldn't feel too bad for him.

I figured you didn't actually mean $100k tx fees but couldn't be bothered to read the long post you linked to.
You make a lot of good points and I do agree that the "tolerable fee" level has been steadily creeping up as the actual fees do. However, I do believe that the people doing so have good intentions. Many of them think very long term and don't care much for temporary issues like high transaction fees because they believe that second layer protocols will be the end solution. These are people that prioritize the health of Bitcoin 10 years from now over the ability to be able to run some businesses in this space at this moment.
I do agree that 2MB should be done as soon as it's safely possible (after SegWit) - my only issue is that it will potentially be used as an argument to then do 4MB, 8MB etc. whenever the fees reach a certain level. 
Personally I am fine with a period of higher fees while we wait for second layer protocols to start removing traffic from the main chain. I am confident SW+2MB would give us runway enough for this to happen without fee levels that are much higher than we see now.

Trying to delay L2 developement to hold back off-chain txs is monumentally stupid. Unless you believe in the pipe-dream of Bitcoin becomes a globally used single layer protocol. I also think it's a red herring, Jihan/Bitmain cares about quarters not decades ahead when halvings cause the coinbase block reward to become neglible. I don't think Jihan is that stupid, the SW deadlock was all about control of protocol development.


Thankfully for the future viability of Bitcoin, the "hashpower decides all" narrative was put to bed. I still think Jihan (and a bunch of deluded big blockers) remain in denial. It's sad to see some double down on their old/original understanding when faced with empirical proof that it was incorrect. Turning a blind eye to reality will leave you rekt.


Yup, between covert asicboost, acquiring stakes in Bitcoin-friendly companies and then majorly influencing how they are run and all the other shenanigans pulled, there are plenty of good reasons to be happy that Jihan is getting a major karma clap-back. 
The sooner these bad actors working against Bitcoin are forced into submission by finally pulling their heads out their asses and realizing they can't tame the honey badger or by doubling down on their stupidity until they are bankrupt - the better. 
As a staunch pro-Bitcoiner, I'm glad to see this implosion happening at a rapid pace. Merry christmas!

There are extremists arguments on either side. I'm sure most "let's see what the impact of SegWit and potential second layers solutions are before hardforking" are not fans of $100k transaction fees.
The thing with high transaction fees is that they (if throughput is gained faster than demand for transactions at a given pricepoint rises) will fall again. Changes in blocksize permanently increases the size of the blockchain going forward and requirements to secure it.
I'm not opposed to 2MB blocks but I think it's shortsighted to want that above SegWit. 
Someone arguing that $100k tx fees are just fine are as extreme in their views as somone arguing 1TB blocks is the best scaling solution.

That sounds a lot more reasonable to me. I would love to see SegWit2x succeed if it leads to no chain split and the code is deemed reasonably well tested (this part could be hard given the deadlines). 
However, I don't personally have sympathy for the ones arguing that they explicitly want the 2MB hard fork before we consider SegWit. To me that is a ideological or emotional argument moreso than it is a rational path for people wanting lower fees and higher throughput.

This is your own assumption. What if I both have $2521 and 1 BTC at the starting point? Then I *both* have BTC that I could chose to buy fiat for and fiat I could chose to buy BTC for. You are creating a premise where everyone is defaulting to USD.
Obviously people will currently own the amount of Bitcoin they want at current prices so it **does** make some sense to interpret the question as "If you won a bet and could chose between $2521 and 1 BTC, which would you prefer" or something to that nature. It's still kind of a weird question since the answer will surely correlate with peoples current exposure.


This is just as meaningful as saying *"Everyone who has 1 BTC and says $2521 is lying"*.
By this logic everyone who owns &gt;1 BTC and &gt;$2521 would be lying no matter what their answer was.

Do you believe asicboost is 'fake news'? Or do you buy Jihan's "we're totally not doing it guys but don't remove it"? Segwit2mb seems like a nice way to keep raking in the benefits.
If indeed asicboost is being used covertly by one large miner, removing it from the equation would realign the incentives between miners/chip producers and users.
For me, asicboost was the missing puzzle piece that finally made it all somewhat understandable - ignoring it entirely in a synopsis of the situation seems rather disingenuous.

The only change I could possibly see is that it somewhat legitimizes Bitcoin as an actual asset and that could reduce peoples potential fears of an outright "Bitcoin ban" or "War on crypto". With a lot of the mainstream news about Bitcoin being related to ransomware or price crashes a nod of recognition like this could be a nice little boost in public perception - which in my opinion is one of the major battles Bitcoin needs to win to get mass adoption.
But yea, people aren't lining up their pension funds on exchanges waiting to unload on tax free Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:16:57
Alright, I can get behind most of that. Although I don't agree on it being comparable to creating a better chip. If segwit2x wasn't asicboost compatible and seemed to just be an excuse to remain in the status quo for another 6 months, I would probably support it too. With that said I think we should be very cautious of block size increases in general, it's probably time for one regardless and a 4x increase in tx throughput (segwit + 2x) would give a lot of runway for 2nd layer solutions to develop to a point where they would be taking a substantial amount of traffic off the main chain before we reached a similar fee situation.
The reason why people use asicboost as an "excuse" is because it suddenly explains why some miners would want to block what should be a uncontroversial and outright desirable protocol upgrade - this is also why it's not comparable to better mining hardware. If I am wrong in this assesment, oh well, we get segwit and all the benefits. If I'm right we remove the grit in the works in we can actually make some real headway.

It is a touchy subject indeed. Hopefully less so post SW implementation. It seems like our conversation forked and we are now on a few different chains here, hopefully Bitcoin won't :)
I do appreciate an honest discussion about these topics without hidden agendas that obscures everything - you made some very valid points. On that note I'm afraid I'll have to stop redditing for tonight. All the best to you.

You're telling me that people act selfishly and there is bad stuff in the world? Boo fucking hoo. You offer no alternatives, nothing constructive just a whiny tirade about how bad it all is.

Sort of, but it's not necesarilly that it would be "noticed on the network" and everyone would agree that bitcoin was now worth more.
Right this moment, there are a ton of buy and sell orders on the different Bitcoin markets, this is people asking fiat money for their Bitcoin or asking for Bitcoin for their fiat money. The reason these orders have not been processed yet, is due to the fact that the people asking to buy are doing so that a lower value than the current market price and the people wanting to sell are asking to do so at a price greater than the current price. These limit orders (sell or buy orders limited to being executed only at a certain pricepoint) make up the order book.
[This]( was the order book on Bitfinex a month or two ago, in it you can see everyone wanting to buy on the green side and everyone wanting to sell on the red side.
If banks (or anyone else with a lot of money) came into the ecosystem and started buying up BTC, they would obviously keep buying the cheapest coins for sale. However, unless the supply of people wanting to sell their coins at the current market price increased at the same rate as the people wanting to buy, the price would automatically go up. 
Let's say that on all the exchanges combined there are 5k BTC for sale that are cheaper than $3000 - after those are bought, the price would now be $3000. Then there are perhaps sell 5k BTC for sale between $3k and $3.5k - if those too get bought up the price will now be $3.5k.
Unless they market buy in huge quantities, this will obviously be a gradual thing, but essentially higher buying pressure than selling pressure (or high demand than supply) will force the price up over time.
At the end of the day, banks hoarding bitcoin would be incredibly expensive (for them) and incredibly profitable for anyone holding BTC. It would be a terrible idea to try to "kill Bitcoin" by doing so since it would only take a lot of Bitcoin out of circulation, effectively rendering the ones still in circulation more valuable. Remember 1 Bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 parts (called satoshis) so it would not really matter if there was only 1 million Bitcoin left in circulation rather than 16.5M or 13M (estimate based on ~3.5M coins being lost in the early days).
It could make a lot of sense for them to hoard Bitcoin as a hedge against loss of revenue as a result of Bitcoin adoption - but still, this won't really affect anyone else negatively - quite the opposite. I doubt it is happening at a large scale tho' - the amount of money flowing into Bitcoin is still way too small for that to be the case.

You wouldn't necesarilly have to use the LN, but the fact that it was available will surely remove a lot of small transactions from the base layer. 
And nah dude, no matter what there will still only ever be 21 btc, .1 won't become unspendable due to fees, although fees $-wise might go up.
I have no idea why you are in such a hurry to support 7 billion people. If that ever become necesarry in your lifetime i doubt you will care that much about tx fees because you will be a multi millionaire many times over. With that said it will (for obvious reasons) never support 7B people unless scaling is fixed and tx fees are reasonable. And of course we will need both on chain and off chain scaling to support the equivalent of the entire worlds population today - I think 99% of people agree with that (Core devs included).
It seems like you are almost looking to be worried.

Yup, or if a significant amount of the people holding are doing so for the long term and not speculating on taking profits too much (speculators becomming "true believers").
People need to realize that there does **NOT** need to flow $1B fiat into Coinbase, Kraken and Huobi etc. for the market cap to increase that much. $1B actually flowing into BTC would probably take us to $10K+ fairly easily (obviously very dependent on how it was done and over what timeframe)

He doesn't have $1M fiat he has 400 BTC, as much as I think he'd benefit by getting humbled a bit, he will probably end up fine - at least financially. If his hodl hands remains as strong with age and his taste for hookers and blow does doesn't take over.

This is starting to sound like the Roger Ver playbook. "LN is not ready" is a terrible argument to hold implementation back (this is effectively what blocking SegWit does). I guarantee you that 2nd layer protocols will advance at a whole different rate once they are actually viable to be implemented.
And arguing against SegWit on the basis of not knowing the exact impact it will have on tx throughput to the fifth decimal point in percentages, is ridiculous too in my opinion. We **know** it drasticly increases TX throughput without the drawbacks of a hard blocksize increase - if your main priority is lower fees, not supporting it is idiotic.
Not supporting SegWit from a stance of "a blocksize increase to 2MB would be perfectly safe and not harm node centralisation" and "we should have increased blocksizes a long time ago" is ridiculous to me, even if I agree that the sentiments (at least the first one) is almost certainly correct. This line of logic makes it seem like the fees are no longer the real issue - rather something with feelings being hurt over stuff not being done the way you wanted it.

If you have a point to make you can do so without being an asshole. However, it seems like you're deluded into buying whatever bullshit, contextless quotes Roger Ver has been selling.
If Bitcoin Core didn't want to scale Bitcoin to a level where adoption could realisticly include the some of the poorest people in the world, they would not have spent so many ressources trying to scale Bitcoin the only way that makes sense long term if we're going to reach thousands of txs pr. second, exponentially on second layers, not linearly on the base layer. Likewise, if Roger really were true to his word he would not have helped delay Segwit with his bullshit concerns and politics for as long as he did. It was never about transaction fees or scaling, it was about trying to gain more control over protocol devolpment. Hopefully he will take his energy to BCH after august 1st, get his Terbyte-block coin and stop stalling progress on Bitcoin.
But keep reading Vers bullshit no-context quotes, designed only to slander some of the greatest contributors of Bitcoin code and let the hate towards "Blockstream Core" take you over.

Buffett told people what he thought based on his own understanding. There is nothing wrong with not being right 100% of the time. Even though Mr. Buffett is the most successful investor of modern times you cannot expect him to be right all the time. If you base your own investment decisions purely on an off-the-cuff remark on something he said on a news show and is mad and think he somehow broke his own rule by being wrong you're dismissing the personal responsibility part in my opinion. I dunno how that's a strawman.
I think you have both exalted him to demigod-status and then turned to outrage when he turned out to not be 100% right in everything. I'm glad to see you can forgive for his sins.
We clearly disagree on the issue (where I believe there is none). I've heard your argument and you've heard mine, repeating them 80 more times will hardly be beneficial to either of us.

A lot of people have been opposing SegWit under the argument that they wanted bigger blocks too/first. So even if they don't have anything against L2 protocols, their actions end up having that outcome. They effectively stall scaling because they disagree with the cautious approach (as little hard forks as possible and small requirements to run a node securing the network).
If all you really care about (genuinely, not as some political bait-and-switch strategy) stalling SegWit for a hard blocksize increase is incredibly irrational. Sadly I think that vocal people that are not completely genuine with their motivations have pursuaded a lot who are.

The 10% in exchange fees has nothing to do with Bitcoin, that is solely due to your choice of fiat on-ramp being expensive and only due to the fact that you didn't have the Bitcoin already. The bad coupon situation again isn't really fair to blame on Bitcoin but rather on the seller. 
So we're left with the $3 fee. Yes, I know it sucks - but it looks like we could be taking a huge step towards making bitcoin better for book-sized purchases in the very near future with the prospect of SegWit activation soon.
Your complaint seems kind of misdirected and weirdly timed considering the scaling deadlock situation looks to have changed a lot in just the last few weeks.
