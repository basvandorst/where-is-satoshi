You've been at your artwork for a long time now. I still have a few of your oldest desktops in my cycle.

Another way to invest in the future of Bitcoin!  As an engineering student, I value scholarships quite a bit.

An event timeline would be wonderful.  It would be nice to be able to send people a link that summarized all the interesting events in this technology's history.

Down vote and move on.

Yes, these Satoshi are bitcoin.

In other words, good exchanges let you send and receive digital currencies with ease. Fiat on the other hand...

You can easily pass some of those along.  Enjoy.

That was almost terrifying how easy that was...  Clicked the site, saw the banner, clicked the default donation amount, got the email confirmation from coinbase...
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:03:36
Yep. So many people miss out on this simple life pleasure.

And I subscribed using my RSS feeder.  Gotta support what you invest in :)
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:13:03
Pretty much... and it's supposed to be fun :)
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:08:55
Yeah I'm lost too.

I suppose an alcoholic will drink whether it goes up or down.
@_date: 2014-03-17 04:42:54
And you don't?

Here are some Satoshi.  I find them valuable as a conversation piece, a way to educate, and a way to have fun.  I don't think about the fiat value too much.

I like it.  The looping of the rain sound file is unfortunately noticeable, and it would be fun if the randomness of the transaction size created visible lightning bolts with correlated branching of the bolts.
Also, one of my favorite things about lightning is how it makes select portions of a cloud pulsate and glow. 
Fine tuning all these effects could produce awesome results that weren't too repetitive.

I think people will manage.
