Nice job. Been out. Will get back in when the charts are right. Meanwhile the Hodl’rs could have made so much more if the did the same. But they gotta stick to their mantra. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:27:12
This is an absurd statement. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:10:15
I second this. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:58:27
I third this. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:57:33
HODL’in redefined. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:37:31
I third your second. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:56:15
OP doesn’t understand there are two sides to everything. Bravo
Excited to se when fear actually kicks in to this equation. Charts are already impressive. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:59:00
I wish I had this same mentality with Betamax ��
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:28:22
Lol this is great. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 16:18:26
I’d say the smart ones are making money on way down. Unlike these implied fools. Happy ������ down day!
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:23:07
This is great. Thanks for this.

Someone would sell coin only at below production price to have incoming capital for keeping the mining operation going. There are other reasons but my main one would be to keep the business operating based on the fact that the price will rise back up over my production costs and I will continue making money. But if I operated on the premise that I will never make money, I’d close shop and liquidate my business

“Lehman brothers would never go to $0!”

Betamax vs VHS, blueray vs HDDVD ect.  (On technology side)
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:30:58
Sounds like you sir are not a hodl’er.  Good for you. (I am assuming these gains are realized)
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:08:20
But it’s about accumulating! 
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:34:09
The great thing about trend lines is you can draw them however you want. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:22:43
Ahh paper millionaires. May the hodl force be with u. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:15:38
I don’t trade on the word “usually” and we can all agree that logic is out the window on this. But I will trade on what it’s doing now. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:11:08
They would be much better off if they understood the peaks the way they preach about buying dips. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:10:16
But accumulation bruh? We’re not trying to make money here. I don’t buy bananas with this stuff I accumulate. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:04:46
This is great! One stop shop lol
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:19:06
This doesn’t make any sense in the discussion since the company already sold the vehicle to the ‘new’ buyer and likely made money on the initial transaction. You would want to compare the used car price to the cost of buying and cleaning which typically is not sold at a loss.

They are all not quite at your comfort level yet. But every person has one. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:42:48
Ah. Just enjoy the panic. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:39:56
Mee too. But not all here look at the charts. More people need to get in. Not enough. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:32:19
Interesting candle pattern. Hmmm
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:13
You do not look at charts do you?
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:04:23
All speculation now unfortunately.  All about the hodl 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:27:29

The epic rise was the worst thing that could have happened. Majority of people won’t use it as a currency or other method, but will see it as a way to make money if it were to rise again. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:59:52
Not really timing. I took a haircut on the move after it was already established. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:04:05
Put the effort in to learn chart patterns and it will be easy. And will feel like a crystal ball
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:43:12
Or could have been smart. Sold when all the signs were there repurchase now and you have more BTC acquired. Hodlrs just don’t understand. 
Nice cartoon BTW
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:02:36
Don’t sell yourself short. You took time to understand and invest in the crypto, not much knowledge left to learn the nuances of the chatrts and trading. Trading is really easy on the long term moves. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:38:22
Stuff like this frustrates me and the potential for widespread adoption of bitcoin. 
I understand this. But general population!?
@_date: 2019-05-24 16:30:45
Don’t we want this as a currency not an asset? I mean this helps but not as a currency use.
