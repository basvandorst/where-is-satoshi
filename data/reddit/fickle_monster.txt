Whoever even thought South Korea would ban Bitcoin clearly doesn't understand how a government works.
A government is primarily for making money for themselves and the country.
Bitcoin is an industry/movement worth 300 billion dollars.
Governments want to be able to tax it. Their "regulation" does protect consumers, but the real aim in making it transparent is to aid in taxation. 
This is why South Korea wants to spearhead the crypto revolution - they will make a shit ton of money and establish themselves as one of the key economic powerhouses of the world.

Exchanges must follow these rules 6, lest ye be smitten by thy rod of Holy Korea:
- Customers’ funds must be kept separately.
- Exchanges must also provide users with thorough explanations of investment risks. 
- They must confirm users’ real names. 
- They must establish an adequate anti-money laundering system 
- They must also have an asset protection system such as dispersion of cryptographic keys. 
- They must increase transparency by disclosing transaction details to the public.
Looks alright to me. Protects the consumer, in my opinion.

I believe if you're set up as a node on the LN, if transactions go through your network, you receive a fee. That's quite an incentive, especially for larger organisations who can connect with more people (Coinbase).

The interviewer raises the use of sock puppets via the birds by bitcoin site, where people were literally paid to retweet anti-BTC remarks. Roger countered and said it's a free site and anyone can retweet anything.
THEN the interviewer says BCash again, inadvertently, mind you, since he said Bitcoin Cash many times beforehand.
Then Rager Ver goes on a rage.
If Ver can't handle be accused of something rather concerning, then he shouldn't be in such a public and influential position. His insecurities will harm BCH more than help it.

1) Unless there has been some social reason within said neighbourhood, house prices do generally increase over time.
2) Assuming Bitcoin is in a bubble, implies that you know Bitcoin's intrinsic value, since a "bubble" in economics is defined as an asset being valued at a rate higher than its intrinsic worth - bear in mind that Gold has a market cap of trillions of dollars, yet its utility is even lower than Bitcoin's.

@_date: 2017-12-14 08:01:30
Not necessarily. If the network becomes widely used enough, then it's possible for transactions to be routes through clients and channels without ever having the need to have you channeled with your client.
So let's say you are starbucks. Susan wants to buy coffee from you using LN - there is no channel set up between you. You do, however, have a channel set up with rob, who has a channel set up with Costa, who has a channel set up with Susan. Your transaction can be routed that way.

@_date: 2017-12-06 05:02:08
So what's to stop either party closing the LN at anytime, even before agreed payment? Is it the HTLC?
Does the lightning network have to be manually set up every time?
Finally, what's to stop the "node" you are using to route your transaction from charging you a fee? What if large businesses captilize on this and create numerous powerful nodes, thereby centralizing?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:11:17
From the looks of your post history, I'd say you're just a troll, so lemme not waste anymore time on you other than a few short points:
1) Calm down.
2) No, really, calm right down.
3) BTC's issues aren't exaggerated - large fees relative to transaction size make BTC unusable in mainstream sense.
4) No-one cares about how edgy or powerful you want to be.
5) I, like a lot of people in the Bitcoin community, care more about Bitcoin's future than having to pay an extra $10 per transaction. With more and more adoption of the likes of BCH, BTC is in fact facing a really dark patch.
6) Calm down. You'll hurt yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:04:47
But isn't that why storing your Bitcoin exchanges aren't smart? Because they're essentially controlling your Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:12:36
You've made one glaring assumptions:
Bitcoin will never become a transactionably efficient currency.
With continuous advances, most recent being the Lightning Network, we can see BTC going into the realm of utility, which it once was.
A lot of BCH fans don't understand the monumental platform BTC has at the moment. It has concreted its value as a financial asset - it only needs to deliver as a currency now. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:16:30
But is that possible? For instance, would I be able to run a LN node from my home P.C? Or would it only be select people who meet the high processor and bandwidth requirements which would be able to?

When is Bitcoin likely to become easily and cheaply transactionable again?
If we are waiting for the lightning network to make this change, how likely is it that it will succeed, and what challenges does the LN face? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:31:55
I still know very little about the lightning network - I'm just trying to understand how all of this works.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:09:46
Exactly my point. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:43:46
Probably because by the time BTC overcomes its issues, BCH will already be established as an alternative.
Of course, BTC will have the most liquidity, have the highest market cap, and the growth network of users. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:06:29
I don't really understand what you're saying.
Roger Ver IS the main cheerleader for Bitcoin Cash. Roger didn't refute this point - he specifically says he's insulted because the interviewer is calling Bitcoin Cash, BCash.
Also, when did the interviewer say whoever is following Ver are Bcash suckers? I watched the whole interview, and I can't remember that ever being said (quote verbatim please?)
Please realise that Ver started bringing up personal stuff, such as business revenue and saying the interviewer doesn't know how to run a successful business because their annual revenue is below $1million (lolwut?), before the interviewer talked about the sock puppets. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:07:34
Both? Including processing power. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:10:06
In BCH's vision, the level of transaction volume which the system needs to be able to sustain in the long-term will increase the block size, AND kick off nodes which will not able to handle it.

Based on what? Any investment has risk. If OP is sure about Bitcoin's tech, development and future, then it's pretty safe, imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:56:22
Roger Ver really really annoys me, and here is a perfect example of why.
Brian Kelly mentioned Bitcoin's intention to release the lightning network for scalability, and asked what Bitcoin Cash's road map and future is like.
Roger Ver then spent 1 minute bashing Bitcoin, said the lightning network would work better on BCH, and didn't answer the question about what BCH's future holds.
Now, unless Ver was basically saying he'd steal the code for lightning network, then he didn't really answer anything - he just sought to bash BTC again.
When he was asked by the interviewer if there is a world where both cryptos can exist, he said there should be, but if BCH siphons enough of the mining hashrate, then BTC will come to a halt.
He said there should be. "THERE SHOULD BE". He knows what he's doing. He doesn't want BTC to exist. He wants BCH to be Bitcoin. He doesn't want BTC to exist alongside BCH at all, because how can BTC exist, if you want the name 'Bitcoin'? It can't.
He's a snake, man....

The OP is trying to elevate themselves out of their poverty stricken state. It's commendable. To be honest, the investment which they've made a solid too. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:46:24


Well then there would have to be mass adoption of the LN and have hubs with a large number of LN connections to other hubs, correct? Otherwise it'll just be a bunch of LN network users who can only spend BTC among each other, and not on a global scale.
How will this be practical on a global scale? Would I be able to easily set up a LN channel with someone across the world from me?


Any idea what the fees might be? Surely no the high fees that we see now?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:50:04
Short term: How and when will the mempool clear up? It's currently sitting at +200,000 unconfirmed transactions.
Long term: Hopefully. How easy would it be to implement LN worldwide? I know the tests are going very well, with recent real world LN transactions having been completed successfully.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:49:41
1) You need to put your bitcoin into the LN which gives you an IOU.
2) It's expensive to take money out of the LN.
3) Block stream will control this all and keep taking fees.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:37:30

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:02:25
Why so?
It's not as though LTC will die if BTC becomes transactionable again. Why would ETH and XRP go down? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:40:00
But it only works within that single channel. When I say "work", I don't mean "be functional". I mean being practical to use.
My question is, how will the network expand, if expansion means people will have to make transactions on the LN, which costs as much as a transaction on the main network right now? This is why organisations such as steam have stopped using BTC as a payment transaction. 
How do we get businesses and people to start using LN when there aren't channels to begin with?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:46:51


Not really. £10,000 is huge in my family, but if I had that and spent it, I wouldn't starve or come to harm in any way. That's probably along the same lines as the OP - just because it's "huge" doesn't mean you can't afford to lose it.


You've immediately lost credibility when you equate investing in BTC, to playing the lottery.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:44:44
In the whole interview, the interviewer referred to Bitcoin Cash as Bcash about 3/4 times. He called Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin Cash many many times more than that.
Roger just has an agenda to further, and that is riding on the coattails of the Bitcoin. It's very very transparent to see. 
EDIT: 
There. If Roger acted with some grace and dignity, Bcash would probably have more fans. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:54:59
It'd be a good way to get a bitcoin conversation started
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:39:13
But I thought the point of LN was to have your transaction rerouted to a side channel, which is hosted by a third party, thus allowing on/main channel transactions to be less and smoother.
Am I wrong in this understanding?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:00:06
Do you think it costs $1000 to set up a LN channel?
or are you blowing the $1000 on whores and crack? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:41:04
Given a block size big enough for just one city’s population, it would restrict node hosting and mining to only those with the most powerful machines, i.e. massive businesses
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:24:43
Really, I think Roger just wants to make a bigger name for himself. He went to prison, got out, became a millionaire through his enterprise, then supported Mt Gox.
He clearly fucked up bad, and he wants to make himself look better. He insecurity and fragile ego is clearly evident of this. 
If he cared at all about the people, he would encourage both BTC and BCH to grow. If either one of them crashed and burned away, there would be many many many people who would lose huge amounts of money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:01:08
Explain. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:06:12
So am I correct in my understanding that the LN is a second layer, somewhat separate from the Bitcoin network, but all transactions (upon completion) are logged onto the Bitcoin network. Through use of Hashed Time Lock Contracts (or smart contracts, as the video says it), anyone can prove that they've paid x amount to person y. The "gold reserve" are nodes, which anyone can be, as long as they have a computer - similar to running a node on the Bitcoin network at the moment. Transactions are routed through said nodes. People running the nodes can charge a fee to be routed through, but competition will lower the price.
Is that correct?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:29:28
Correct. As a rule of thumb, you should never invest more than you are okay with losing - at the very core of it, it's akin to gambling, as is any investment.

But then what would stop me from charging a fee for running a node via the LN?
Oh, I don't pay attention to people with emotive stances - I just want to understand if lightning network is good or bad, what's good about it and what's bad about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:37:42
BCH will still have some users. Businesses will most probably give numerous options to pay with various forms of crypto in the future - BTC, BCH and LTC being the main ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:30
Isn't increasing block sizes going to cause that exact scenario?
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:31:22


But a normal transaction right now is precisely the issue of using BTC. It's slow and expensive. This means setting up the LN channels will be slow and expensive. This means adoption could happen very slowly, or not at all...


The point is, people don't. People aren't using their Bitcoin to buy things because the transaction fees are high, and the transaction times are slow. 
Moreover, the fact that the Bitcoin is essentially locked in within the Lightning Network gives even less incentive for businesses to accept them, especially for small businesses which need funds for immediate use. 


Both parties of the channel, or just the one who initiated setup (the one who is sending BTC).

@_date: 2017-12-14 12:26:11
Yes, and how do we get enough channels to support the use of the LN, when it costs money and time to set up said LN?
It was fairly easy for BTC to be adopted in the businesses which adopted them, mainly because it was quick and cheap to use. LN will be slow and expensive to set up, and it will only become quick and cheap to use IF it grows and is adopted.

I'm not going to take a person seriously when they say there's no issue that you can't use BTC for everyday shopping, since you can just use a debit card fill with fiat money.
This isn't about you. No-one cares how well you've done. What you're doing at the moment is wanking your own ego. This is about Bitcoin. And if you think Bitcoin is fine because you use the money from crypto-trading, load it onto a debit card and make purchases, then you're not only a toxic person, but you're also a dumbass.

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:55:27
To be honest, Bitcoin Cash as a cryptocurrency poses little harm to Bitcoin - they can both co-exist. Miners will mine whichever they view to be profitable, but when there's a surplus of miners in one currency, it'll even out to the other - the difficulty rating is meant to do this.
The only issue are people are like Roger Ver, who are obsessed with crushing BTC in the short term, in order to take the miners for BCH. I believe those people shouldn't be given a platform to breathe. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:15:05
Yes, I know. I was joking.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:32:28
Because most of the small scale nodes couldn't cope with the increase in block sizes, and thus would have been pushed off the system, and those which could support it would only be a minority, and thus centralized and almost monopolize all the transactions fees?

2)So Bob/coffee shop will only get the BTC stated on the balance sheet once the LN is closed? So am I correct in understanding that the coffee shop won't actually be able to spend the Bitcoin they received from the transaction until the LN is closed?
3) How expensive is it to set up a LN channel? And how is this done? 
4) How expensive is it to close the LN channel and have miners authorize the signatures?
5) How exactly do you shut down a LN Channel?
6) Am I then correct in understanding that the LN channel isn't really for people who want to make one-off payments to businesses?

@_date: 2017-12-14 12:07:13
I don't think you understand the issue.
It is only cheaper and faster to use LN once there are enough channels open to support the practicality of using LN.
How do we get to that point, when opening a channel costs as much as transacting bitcoin on the network right now?
It's naive to believe people, especially businesses, will open up lightning networks with hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands when it costs quite a bit to do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:20:55
Well if large organisations, such as coinbase, start to use LN, then it'll be fairly straightforward - it would just be a case of the community actively engaging in sending BTC between eachother via the LN.
However, humans are stupid and selfish, so it'd take some sort of short term incentive for the community to do this, other than supporting the LN and the growth of BTC/Bitcoin.

But there would still be the initial "bite the bullet and deal with the big transaction fees and transaction times" stage, isn't that right?
That is where most people, including businesses, would not want to set up a LN. Moreover, the fact that you can only use the money within the LN, when you might want to use said money when transacting with someone or a businesses which hasn't yet used LN would mean you have to pay another fee to set up a LN with them.
Also, who pays when setting up a LN network?

I thought increasing the block sizes would increase the size of storage needed to run a node - therefore, it would lead to miner centralization, since only a select few group of miners could afford such huge storage space.

Not in relation to the definition of a bubble - don't take a random 2 words and think it's worthwhile to analyse.


Anyone who is familiar with basic Economics knows that my definition of a bubble is correct. That's not up for debate.
It amazes me how you can be so dense. You later speak of the technology behind BTC, and how that has attributed to its rise, but then you compare it to the Tulips mania - really?
Think of it this way. The rise of the telephone and telecoms industry - was that a bubble? The internet - was that a bubble as well? Why not? Because the technology behind them were solid. Because the world needed a better way to deal with real world problems. Bitcoin is almost exactly the same in having solid tech behind it, and solving real world problems. You can't compare that with Tulips, or ignorantly say "yea, but it COULD be a bubble!" and think you're smart.


Robert Shiller. The guy who says Bitcoin is similar to being a bubbe, but then says he'd happily buy some too. Hmmm.
Have you read Shiller's thoughts on the matter? He analyses Bitcoin on a purely socio-economical basis, with an emphasis on historical reference, rather than technical observation. He compares Bitcoin to the times of bimetallism (where precious metals were used as currency).
Shiller doesn't understand Bitcoin's tech. He does say (in some interviews) that he's not demeaning Bitcoin's tech, so perhaps he does to some extent - but then that's completely contradicted by his comparison of it to past currencies which hold absolutely no comparison in terms of utility and practicality that BTC has to offer.


I'm sure many people thought the internet wouldn't deliver either - mainly those who didn't understand it but thought they should still talk about it in a meaningful way, btw.


You don't really understand the dotcom bubble if you think it was people investing in the internet, and it was the internet which wasn't able to keep up with business models, or expansions or developments.
The Dotcom Bubble was the failure of investors and frenzied investing in BUSINESSES which did not deliver - there are individual reason why each business (website) did not succeed. Most of them were just crap. Some thought they should expand quicker than they actually should have. Etc. None of this was due to the internet.


Bitcoin is decentralized, deflationary, almost free (low transaction fees), peer to peer, and highly usable in that it can be integrated with so many different areas (such as integrating it with purchases of vehicles - the block chain recognizes and authorises the payment, which in turn activates and runs a code, which instructs said car to be automatically registered and insured upon authorisation from nodes, for example. Robotics is also a VEEEERY interesting integration).
Look, you don't understand BTC if you think that the only way it's competing, or the main benefit it has, is transactions. 
Please, this is getting a bit painful now. I'm literally saying the same things over and over. You can ask me to inform you about Bitcoin, but you're clearly talking about something you know very little about....


By your logic, the internet, smartphones, telephones, and anything which proved to be hugely innovative and made huge leaps in everyday technology is similar to a MLM scheme - increased advocating = increased demand = increased price. 


There are numerous reasons why someone would buy BTC, and I have no doubt a lot of them did because they want to get rich.
But this isn't truly what BTC is about. In the future, BTC will be the direct method of exchange in terms of currency to asset - the more coveted it is (in terms of Fiat money), and the easier it becomes to use, the more people will be willing to accept it, both on a personal and professional (business) level. 
Besides, it helps that people are just in it for the money. This is fine. It drives the price of it up. The difference between this and any other asset, is that the tech behind Bitcoin is justified and future-proof.


If you want to have a long chat about inflation, disinflation, deflation and how it occurs and impacts a nation's currency, then PM me. This is about Bitcoin.
On the notion of BTC as it stands, I am correct. The more people who buy BTC, the more expensive it will be. 


You're not criticizing it with any worthwhile knowledge of it though. You understand very little about it, which is evident by what you've said about it. I mean, you even said Fiat money can compete with BTC if they upgrade their transaction methods, as if that has anything to do with what BTC is all about...
I don't criticise something I know very little about - because to criticise something, you should first know it through and through. If you don't understand what it is, how can you know it's bad or good?
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:54:00
How do you research Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and determine they're the same thing? If they were, then there wouldn't have been a hard fork. There wouldn't have been a split.
The technology is different, the price is different, the community behind it is different, the branding is different... 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:10:46


And what "raw economic data" does not fit the growth in price, when price is dictated by consumer and investor confidence, as well as by valuation consensus?


Yes, it is true.
First of all, you have to understand Subway is a franchise - as such, a chain can accept Bitcoin, while another would not. This is the same for any franchise.
Secondly, you have to understand at the moment, BTC has scaling issues (as we've already discussed). This has lead to higher than acceptable transaction fees, etc. But I've already touched upon this point:
**Yes, that's because BTC is still extremely young. It is not yet at a point where it can contend with big names like Visa in terms of transactions count.
However, with further development, such as Segwit2x, Lightning, etc, we can see further efficiency, lowering of transaction fees, increases of block sizes or streamlining of running nodes, etc.**
This means that at the moment, for someone to buy something small with BTC means they have to pay a transaction fee which they're not happy to pay - it's actually already become quite low, but the market needs to realise this is the case, and businesses need to get back on the ball. Small businesses, such as online outlets for tea and such, are already accepting Bitcoin with reduced prices to compensate for said transaction fees. 


Again, you use this term "bubble", when you don't really understand it. When something is in a "bubble", it means its price has exceeded that of its intrinsic value.
As I said in my initial reply to you, it is entirely possible, and indeed probable, for BTC to become a global currency, due to the technology behind it (block chain tech) as well as the ever growing confidence and development, of it. This means the worth of it would be at least $500,000 per BTC if it reaches global currency scale, competing with Fiat money in terms of utility.
Why do you keep saying it's "bubbling" every 2 years if you understand the above? Anything of great value will always have ups and downs in the market, because that is how trading and currencies work - people buy, people sell. However, because the tech, future potential, and key aspects of BTC are so great, it has continued to go up and up, despite experiencing dips. Or do you think whenever something reaches a high point, then dips down, that's the "bubble" popping?


This is where you have to understand the issues and proposed solutions. For instance, Lightning system allows lower transaction fees, as well as increased speed - the issue is decentralization in some aspects though.
No-one knows how the future will turn out. The internet was initially fraught with issues and bugs. The telecommunications industry initially had huge issues with connectivity. Both needed funding through investors to become what they are today - and the reason investors invested is because the technology and utility behind those two were revolutionary and solid. Just like bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, you have the added bonus of BTC already proving itself over and over again to be as resilient as no-one expected it to be.


Right, you clearly aren't understanding what I'm saying.
BTC is VERY YOUNG. No matter how great a cryptocurrency is, it doesn't become a global currency with real world usage in a matter of months, or even years. It takes a long time to compete with likes of Visa which also took decades to become what they are today.
There are steps to be taken. Making BTC a financial asset has already been done. Next is improving and developing the system to become easier to use it as a monetary token in exchange for other assets - as I said many times before, the only real issues with this at the moment are transaction times, and transaction fees. And as I've said, again many times before, businesses are already accepting BTC as means of payment, showing this to be the case. 
I mean, we're on a thread about a business which is accepting BTC as a reduced stock price... How can you be so dense?


Currency also works on supply and demand, just like any other asset which is bought and sold. When the supply increases, the demand decreases, because the value is lower (inflation) - the opposite is also true. When more of the product (the currency) is bought, the supply decreases, thereby increasing the demand, increasing the value. This is disinflation. The difference is that disinflation is in the positive, whereas deflation is in the negative. The only thing you are correct about is that deflation is combated in terms of fiat money and government - this is because it increases debt value, which is bad for a country (it is, however, good for savers). This being said, disinflation is necessary, in order to stop increased inflation which ultimately cripples the country, due to decrease in value of said currency. What you also have to understand is that currency is constantly inflating and disinflating to the exchange of said currencies - the very nature of this is based on supply and demand (buying more GBP = GBP worth more). However, you also have to bear in mind that BTC, by its very nature, is immune to inflation in the long-term, and is deflationary, due to the limited supply (21 million BTC). As such, this doesn't bear any relevance to BTC in the long-term.
However, none of the above matters - I just wanted to educate you a bit about currency, since you said that's not how currency works, and you clearly don't understand it... If you understand the above, then you'd understand my statement: *the more people who buy BTC, the more it is worth, but that is how currency works* is true, because that is how currency works.


I actually agree with you here. The cryptocurrency communities are quite toxic.
This is when you have to ignore the noise - pro or against - based on emotional arguments, fears and misunderstandings, do your own research into the cryptocurrencies (each one you find interesting) and learn more about the technology behind it, how it applies to every day life, what the development teams are doing to improve it, how it stands as a brand, how it is interacting with the world of finance, etc. 
Make up your own mind. But please please please, do not talk shit about any cryptocurrency (or anything in life, for that matter) if you don't understand it.
If you have some actual worthwhile concerns after educating yourself, feel free to ask me anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:41:12
I was having this discussion with one of my colleagues today.
He was asking me why a business would value BTC over GBP.
I told him this:
"When a currency becomes more valuable to have, mainly due to their security or potential future growth, then they will prefer that currency. I guarantee you, businesses which understand crypto currency will soon offer discounts if people buy their products or services using BTC."
I'm not wrong.

What d'you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:25:37
Thanks for the quote - I aim to please. :D
OP. It depends what you want to do with that .1 BTC.
The general advice here is hodl it, since that will be the best for the growth of BTC (for now), which will in turn be good for you when you can buy non-fiat related assets (car/house/ship) with your BTC.
Coinbase to GDAX to hardware wallet is fine.
Coinbase to hardware wallet is also fine, but Coinbase will charge you highish fees. 
You don't need a hardware wallet if you're happy with the security on your P.C or phone. But I'd always recommend one - if some of the predictions i've heard and read are correct, BTC could take over 1 - 10% of the Forex market. That'd be around $500,000 - $1,000,000 per BTC. 
That'd make your .1 BTC $50,000. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:28:34
I see you don't know much about bitcoin either.
- As you can see, Bitcoin has always rebounded from "dips", becoming stronger than ever. Why is this? Proven track history, investor confidence, solid dev team, innovative tech, expanding community.
- Sure. And Internet 2.0 could come and replace the internet that we have now. You could win the lottery and spend your time shagging palm trees. How likely is this? How likely is it that another crypto could come and upset BTC's tech within the same field that BTC is engaged in? How likely is it that it could destroy and supersede the BTC brand's position in finance markets today? 
- I'd suggest you actually learn about what a "bubble", in terms of finance, is. Bitcoin has by no means exceeded its own intrinsic worth. If anything, it hasn't even reached 5% of its potential maturity - becoming a global currency would mean it reaches 1 - 10% of the forex market, making each btc worth $500,000 - $1 million.
I'm not looking to argue with you. I only advise you to read up on BTC, global currency, and how the market works. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:39:30
After the fork, will I then own as much BTC in B2X also, given that they share the same history?

That's quite wrong - people often give gifts with the intention of pleasing the receiver. By that notion, the obvious method of choosing a give would be to pick a gift which they "want", but that's superficial in intent. The gifts you give is always a reflection of the intent you have in giving it, and it is a reflection of how you feel about them.
When I give BTC, I'm saying "This is the future, and I really want you to a part of it".
Bitcoin/cryptocurrency/block chain tech will be the future. The sooner they learn about it, the better.
It'd be a bit like when phones were first invented, if someone gave their friends and family phones for Christmas.

Kind of.
You generate the paper wallet (which will have the private and public key), print it off, give it to your friends and family.
You don't have the 12 word key, which is derived from your private key - you'll just have the private key. You can send BTC to the public key.

It doesn't matter if Bitcoin eventually becomes owned by every single bank in the world, and gets butt fucked by every greasy politician in office.
It is still BITCOIN. You can't just take a brand name, just like if McDonalds changed their burger recipes, and someone else erected a burger chain and mimicked McDonald's original recipe, they can't call themselves McDonalds.

I agree with you, to some extent. I've sort of lost sight of my audience who might just not understand a word of what I've wrote. I need to simplify things.
I did intend this to be an educational leaflet, rather than advertisement, though. I was hoping the "benefits of using BTC" was what they would get out of it...
Maybe if I made the summary of how BTC works the main content - a simplified short sentence, rather than a long detailed paragraph.

Ooooh, I see. You think because no-one can predict the future with utmost certainty, Bitcoin's value is possible to hugely depreciate, therefore you shouldn't invest in it. 
Okay. I urge you to read about the technology behind Bitcoin (block chain technology) as well as the increasing investments and confidence increase from the public, as well as continued interest from financial institutions within the finance-sphere of the world. 
Before you go do that though, I'll just say this - you have to be a real moron to talk smack about something you don't know anything about.
EDIT: In reply to your last point - the reason why I haven't sold my house and put everything into Bitcoin is because I'm living in my house. Also, it's never smart to put all your money into one investment, no matter how sure that investment is - it's called diversifying your portfolio. Start thinking, please.

One with intelligence, which furthers a discussion.


What on earth are you talking about? The "raw data" (I assume you mean the code and bitcoin network) has no relation to the value or growth of the price of Bitcoin. The value is determined by consumer confidence, investment, and agreed consensus. 
Also, I told you why Bitcoin is becoming stronger, but you seemed to completely omit the sentences following what you quoted... Censorship is a really shitty thing to do.


Bitcoin is still extremely young - a global currency doesn't happen quickly. 
What we have seen, in this year especially, are more businesses accepting Bitcoin (anything from Subway chains to lamborghini dealerships, to even online tea suppliers), more investments on the finance-sphere (Ben Miller putting 30% of his fortune into BTC, for example), and more support from individuals and organisations, such as Sphere.


Give me your source about alt coins gaining popularity in the dark web markets and slowly replacing BTC there too. Please, I'd love to see it.


BTC has indisputably been the biggest financial growth in terms of cryptocurrency.
I've told you exactly how BTC growth is not speculation, but you refuse to read or acknowledge it:
**Proven track history, investor confidence, solid dev team, innovative tech, expanding community**


Yes, that's because BTC is still extremely young. It is not yet at a point where it can contend with big names like Visa in terms of transactions count.
However, with further development, such as Segwit2x, Lightning, etc, we can see further efficiency, lowering of transaction fees, increases of block sizes or streamlining of running nodes, etc. 


I don't really see your point here.
The reason why many people who buy BTC are holding (or hodling) is because they want to have it increase in value before they use it to buy non-fiat related assets (such as a house, a car, etc.). You're thinking in terms of fiat money, which is directly against what BTC is. 


See, this is where I know you don't understand anything about BTC or cryptocurrency.
You are right in that the more people who buy BTC, the more it is worth, but that is how currency works... If you say that BTC is a cult or pyramid scheme based on that, then every single currency, or every single thing which has value (homes, cars, etc.) also fits that description - the more people want to buy the new vauxhall, the more expensive vauxhall will make it, as it is more valuable to the general public.
If you have 50 free minutes, I suggest you watch this video:
The speaker is called Andreas (I forget his last name). He really knows his stuff about Economy and Cryptocurrency.
Keep an open mind. I not trying to brain wash you - to be honest, I couldn't care less if you buy BTC or not, because I know others will see sense and engage in it, since it's literally the future of money.

Wrong right off the bat. Bitcoin is built intertwined with Blockchain Tech - Blockchain was made with Bitcoin in mind... To say "Bitcoin is a business which could fail, and blockchain tech could live on" is like saying "telephones could fail as business entirely, but the telecommunication network will live on!" No. That's stupid. 


I like how you can accurately see BTC's growth and state the impossibilities in them.


Okay, and early users of the internet were telling people how amazing the internet was, and how everyone should get a computer to share information and spread information as easily and quickly as possible. They were talking about how innovative the tech was, and how it could help everyday life.
MLM scheme, by your definition.


I've said this many times before, but you're either not intelligent enough to understand, or you just don't want to acknowledge you're wrong. I'll summarize:
1) BTC may have the means soon to become an efficient transactional currency (multiple layers, segwit2x, lightning, etc.)
2) BTC is already a global currency.
3) If BTC continues huge mainstream adoption (as it has already gained mainstream investment), then it is well within the realms of 1 to 10% of the forex market.
4) This makes BTC worth $500k - $1mil per BTC. 
5) Demand, price, confidence is closely linked.
Read all of that over and over and over. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.


Right, so you admit you misunderstood the dotcom bubble?
Refer to the above. The difference is utility. The potential in BTC is huge. Absolutely massive. 


SO your point here is "BTC is 8 years old, and it isn't mainstream adopted yet. I HAVE DOUBTS!"
To upset the economy of the world, it takes time. To create technology which can run on a global scale, takes time. To gain investors, takes time.
What will happen is that in the early stages of BTC (which it is in now), the growth will be fairly slow, then it go faster, then it will spike and continue to spike.
Why? Because investors invest in thing which are being invested in. Confidence, value. The technology behind BTC and its utility will sustain this, and back it up.


If you want a comment thread 5000 words long per comment, then please say so. I'd be happy to oblige. If you want to be sensible, then PM me your thoughts on inflation, deflation and disinflation, and we can talk about this. It's only me and you here - no-one else gives a shit. 


I've told you exactly what Shiller has been saying, and how he has only looked and referenced BTC from a socio-economical background. I'm actually engaging in a discussion it by analysing and discussing multiple points, whereas you just say "that sounds like what a xxxx would say...."
Btw, I'm sure many people thought early internet advocators were MLM participants too. Because no-one likes change, right? Least of all the ignorant.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:25:06
And if BTC increases by 50% in value when you sell, what are you going to do then?
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:30:46
Ah, good spot. thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:03:41


I'm not making assumptions - this is what you said in relation to giving BTC as a gift. As such, you view BTC as just money. 
You think giving someone the opportunity to learn about the future of currency and the world is "impersonal"? 
Right. Chalk it up to cultural difference.
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:22:25
The gift of giving BTC could be worth 100x what it's worth now.
It could also give them the drive to learn about cryptocurrency, BTC, and how it could change the world.
It's a wonderful gift - much more useful than a box of chocolates. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:33:28
It's good. If people think this is a dip, they'll buy, therefore boosting the price up again. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:21:15
I'm willing to start a Kickstarter if people are interested.
I'd need a video creator though - perhaps we could employ someone like FreddieW to do some kickass CGI stuff? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:48:25
How can they do this? It's like calling the pound a dollar if the pounds exceeds the power of the dollar... What?
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:57:25
I've taken out the warning, and put this instead:
**Bitcoin Forks**
**When there is a disagreement in the community on how Bitcoin should be operated/developed, it can result in hard forks, which produce separate cryptocurrencies. These are not to be confused with the original Bitcoin.**
**Bitcoin – BTC (the original)**
**Bitcoin Cash – BCH**
**Bitcoin Gold - BTG**
(dunno why you got downvoted)
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:31:30
Put 1% of your paycheque into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:00:57


The aim isn't to remove transaction fees, but to lower them. There's nothing wrong with paying a transaction fee for a transaction - the network needs people to run it. 
No shit. BTC needs further development to be able to handle its growth. I never said development such as lightning, segwit2x would solve everything.


I'm not sure if you're being intentionally dense, or if you're just not reading my comments. 
**As I said in my initial reply to you, it is entirely possible, and indeed probable, for BTC to become a global currency, due to the technology behind it (block chain tech) as well as the ever growing confidence and development, of it. This means the worth of it would be at least $500,000 per BTC if it reaches global currency scale, competing with Fiat money in terms of utility.**
I never said "if an asset falls then recovers, then it was never in a bubble which popped".
I said that the definition of a bubble is if the value assigned to an asset fair exceeds that of its intrinsic value. Bitcoin hasn't come CLOSE to reaching its intrinsic value, at all. As such, it's not in a bubble.
Now, if in the future, a long long way from now (10 years, kek) Bitcoin is worth 1 million, and everyone and their Mum was using Bitcoin, and people could buy milk with 0.00000001 BTC, then it STILL wouldn't be in a bubble. Why? Because its value is justified by its usage and adoption. 


Quite a few things wrong here:
1) The bitcoin "hype" is based on Bitcoin's technology, potential, utility, and future.
2) If you mean the BTC advocates are "fooled" by con-people to begin with (thereby becoming shills), then you're already starting your viewpoint from a position of bias. Also, the fact that you'd think this shows you believe BTC to be a con. As such, you don't understand BTC.
3) The reason the Dotcom bubble happened and burst was because of insane investments on businesses which were not able to meet the growth projected - then when major selling happened, people followed suit. The difference between the dotcom bubble and what is happening with BTC, is that BTC as a financial asset and currency is actually viable to invest in.


Subway does accept BTC. Not all of them, but some do. Apologies if you misunderstood.
It's similar to saying "McDonalds does Special Chicken Tikka Burgers", when in fact, only select stores do them. 


A man with wikipedia thinks he holds the keys to the world (I vaguely remembered that definition of inflation on wiki from when I was writing up assignments on Climate of the Economy in the Modern Age).
Inflation is also swayed by socio-economical factors, which all hinder or boost stability and confidence. The main factor of a currencies strength and weakness will always be supply and demand - how coveted is that currency. How much do people want it. 
This is all besides the point though - what YOU said was this wasn't true:
**You are right in that the more people who buy BTC, the more it is worth, but that is how currency works.**
If next week, everyone who owned GBP exchanged it to EUR, what do you think would happen?
GBP would plummet. EUR would sky rocket. 
There would be an abundance of GBP which no-one wants, and there wouldn't be enough EUR to go around.
Simple supply and demand. You cannot seriously be this basic to not understand this. 
Look, I'm happy to talk with you about what BTC is, how it works, and how it will fit into the modern age. What you shouldn't do is just bash it with your ignorant little fists (not that it'll do much harm).

Panos Mourdoukoutas (the contributor) doesn't know what he's talking about.
He ends the article with:
"The technology that made Bitcoin will crush it, provided that big banks and big governments don’t crush it ahead of technology, as was previously discussed here."
If you read his article on Bitcoin's technology crushing Bitcoin, it basically says that other cryptocurrencies can be made using the same block chain technology, which could inevitably crush Bitcoin.
Yeah, because likes of BCH and every other spawn of Bitcoin has really hampered the growth of the Godfather of cryptocurrency. 
What a tool. He clearly doesn't like change.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:13:34
Nice explanation.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:03:37
Because getting a 30% discount means you are more willing to buy it.
Not all customers will buy with BTC, but those who do will be giving the seller an asset/currency which will appreciate in value much more than the dollar.
The seller can't discount all items by 30%.
Basic business...
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:31:16
I'll just look at previous trends and act accordingly.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:01:06
Wait, I don't understand. If the bitcoin is in my account on my phone wallet, how do I not own it?
Wouldn't the desktop wallet be the same as the phone wallet, but on my desktop?
What would happen if I lose my hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:29:14
Well I wanted to start off with 1 BTC. 
I'm just going to go ahead and buy a ledger nano s. Then when the BTC crashes, I'll buy more.

Does bittylicious instantly transfer bitcoins to my designated wallet address?

What's the long answer?
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:19:47
It's not, really, because a month ago, were constantly shitting on BTC about the unconfirmed transactions - now they're silent. It's funny.
Besides, this is meant to be a subreddit about BTC - it's well within reason to talk about the huge drop in BTC unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:38:53
So would it be smarter to buy the Ledger first, then just directly buy and send bitcoins to my ledger?
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:25:02
What is this? Is this a scam bot. :s
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:03:56
Should I buy another BTC?!

There's no reason why it can't though.

When you say 'private key' do you mean this:
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:08:42
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:38:04
So there's no way Bitcoin can lose its value?

I had a read through it.
How is my method incorrect?
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:14:14
Thanks for this. 
So the 'seed phrase' is essentially the private key?
Is there any consensus on what value of bitcoin would necessitate the buying of a hardware wallet?

China didn't ban use of bitcoins though - just the exchanges. Besides, China is already known for banning freedoms involved in relation to the internet.
What if the likes of Germany ban use of BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:29:38
But what if major players start to ban BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:25:57
So is it conceivable that Bitcoin wouldn't be able to recover from their next crash?
Or has Bitcoin spread so much that that isn't really a possibility anymore?
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:35:52
Well what if the US goes down the same route as China and shuts down exchanges?
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:58:34
It won't stop, because BCH needs to keep claiming to be Bitcoin to survive. There is a reason why noone talks about bitcoin gold, and that's because it didn't claim to be bitcoin.
Bitcoin Cash is quite literally riding on the coat tails of Bitcoin, all the while bashing it, to survive.
