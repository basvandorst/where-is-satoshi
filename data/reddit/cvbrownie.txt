I believe I've seen that dash pays their employees at a set rate of dash. I think it was like 15 dash/ month or something. I can't remember, but at the time i did the math and it equaled out to about 80k/year when dash was at $500.
Not sure if this was alongside a cash salary or what.

A bleed while the most popular exchange is down for scheduled maintenance is to be expected.
If anything expect a small rise when it opens back up shortly.

It ended as a pr stunt but it absolutely was not planned.

Copy monkey...don't ask why I'm browsing this thread three months later, but I certainly will be updating my employee profile tomorrow.

i wanna start a company and fail just so i can write a book with this chapter.

 To be fair to Microsoft shiftykitten would be a dope name.

 GOOD point. Sorry i pointed out that this is a stupid post and hurt your feelings.

If he still cares about bitcoin it's irrelevant. Satoshi could be a group of people, or he could be dead. If he wants fiat he can cash it out gradually and keep both. I personally wouldn't worry about it.
Bitcoin has much more pertinent issues.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:16:02
Make sure you wait for it to reach all time high
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:31:46
holy shit.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:22:15
I think you can do it at pawm shops 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:40:37
By the penis or vagina
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:13:53
I challenge you to do so. Not because I don't think you can, but I want you to waste your time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:21:21
mods stop being lazy and make an 11k price thread
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:03:52
i was told there would be crashes...
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:16:00
Yeah don't borrow. Sell everything outright. Then do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:56:07
No there is literally no one else expecting this. You are the only one. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:09:35
i feel like im usually pretty hard to perplex.
im perplexed. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:53:21
nah if you're 41 odds go up to about 1/2 chance of dying in the previous year. don't fight it just stats bro
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:35:49
But will it be Bitcoin? That's a question I'm really intrigued by. A better alternate could come along. It almost always happens.
Take Quark, for example.......just. fucking. kidding...about Quark at least.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:40:30
Do you have a source? I believe you, but i haven't been able to find anything detailing plans like that.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:13:32
Fair and true. I realize its not all about holding, but also spending and helping the market grow. I think my plan is to continue making small investments when its convenient to me. If i lose it, it will be money i won't miss.I absolutely appreciate the feedback my friend. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:07:43
Or maybe a trillion!!!1
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:31:48
I'm kind of stoked about this crash. Feel bad for people losing money, but I'll admit it, I'm way late to the party. $1100 a coin was demoralizing. I bought 20 bucks worth to get myself started two days ago. I didn't think that $1100 was sustainable for right now, but I wanted to be set up.
So now that we're falling, I can wait a few more days and then buy in an amount I'm comfortable with after it's leveled out. Look away, check back in a couple years...spend if I want.
While today sucked for a lot of you, I'm kinda happy.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:08:34
but but but...to the moon!
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:12:42
The fuck are you saying? What? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:39:44
Im a buyer, but it's really hard for me to believe or fathom much more than what it's at now.
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:58:05
Pathetic is what it is. Watching right now is just....pathetic.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:34:10
This is going to flush out a lot of bad eggs. Plain and simple.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:06:34
It's cool that people are starting to recognize and accept it, but for it to reach those numbers it's going to have to compete with entire monetary markets on a high level. I think it will eventually, but its going to  have to get easier to use.
I took me a few days to understand it and while im not a genius, im no idiot. The process has to get simpler. It almost needs its own debit card. Perhaps having a wallet on your phone will suffice, but until it really becomes a viable replacement for paper money, it won't blow up to those numbers. Not saying it can't though.
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:20:08
It's "ur"

Ron Paul is idolized on Reddit.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:01:23
How much fear is there that Bitcoin be replaced by a superior? Whether it be something already in play or a distant future competitor?
I appreciate your feedback, by the way. I own a little bit myself, but i really do want to get in it for the long long haul.
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:44:06
Thatll be .00027 bitcoins please! 
Yeah, that wasn't going to last
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:03:09
Jesus Christ.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:53:28
No kidding. I bought 20 bucks worth. It is now 10. Ill buy if it falls under 500. What's the point of buying .0018 bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:41:42
So we're talking pretty much the complete over taking of current monetary systems. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:57:13
I would recommend knowing what you're doing before you buy.
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:09:15
I sold all my assets today and put everything I had into Bitcoin. Now I have two bitcoins! How long until I'm a millionaire?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:13:58
Yeah good point. Guess we'll find out over the next week or so. Could be right back up to $1000 or down to who knows what.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:25:37
No. No.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:07:54
Optimal hypocrisy at work!
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:16:58
But if they did take action it could potentially be a very  serious blow to bitcoin. Ebay and Paypal are longstanding names...who would people trust?
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:50:57
That's the hard part in believing right now. The imaginary coin. But lets be real, its not like my dollars are really backed by anything. At this point, a dollar is what im told it is as is a bitcoin. Dirty hands are in my dollars, though.
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:41:04
What's the coin cap though? How many in circulation by the time all of them are mined?
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:55:43
Ya'll are retarded.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:08:11
Seriously. This dude's like a bitcoin celebrity.
Edit: I was looking at his post history and I've decided that as long as is posting, I'll invest full motherfucking faith in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:01:09
IT'S NOT THE REAL GOD DAMN MARKET.
I really hope this flushes out a ton of people. The get rich quick  people will be running like crazy.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:58:19
What about the cap though? I don't understand it to be honest. Because bitcoins breakdown,wouldn't having the trillions of broken down coinbytes  potentially cause mass inflation of bitcoins?
This is really poorly phrased...i don't know how to fix it. Hopefully it baffles sense to you.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:13:15
You have no fucking clue what the fuck youre doing.
