We have taxes for the following reasons:
* To help stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar
* To use as public policy (subsidizing technologies, penalizing industries, etc.)
* To assess the costs of certain national benefits, such as highways and social security
[Here's a friendly Owl who can explain it better than I can!](
Now about your comments RE: Inflation. Inflation is defined as *too much money chasing too few resources.* Everyone focuses on the *too much money* part but totally forgets the *too few resources* part.
The [reason why]( Zimbabwe went into hyperinflation was because the prevalence of white farmers in agricultural production—commonly viewed as a heritage of colonialism—fueled calls by Robert Mugabe to return the fertile “stolen lands” to black Zimbabweans.
Without the necessary knowledge and experience to run the farms, the agricultural sector collapsed leading to a supply-side catastrophe. Printing money (in order to buy U.S. dollars on the forex market) was a symptom of the actual problem: Mass starvation.

From your link: “Only debt held by the public is reported as a liability on the consolidated financial statements of the United States government.
In accounting, a liability is always someone else's asset. The “National Debt” is literally our asset. Cash. Currency.
That's why every “National Surplus” was followed by a depression on account of the private sector not having enough cash to spend and needing borrow more and more money.

The horrifying thing is people in this thread thinking public debt = private debt and not realizing that eliminating public debt means taking every dollar in every American's pocket and throwing it into an incinerator.
Good luck buying groceries tomorrow with no National debt in your pocket.

You only read the first paragraph because he later reminds us:


He's talking about how to pay off the debt “cautiously” in a non-fiat system. You actually can't pay off the “debt” in a  fiat system because fiat National Debt is not *really* a debt per se.

I said nothing about *debt*. 
The stupidly called “National Debt” is not debt and it's literally every dollar in circulation that hasn't been taxed away.

Any cap on a currency is a cap on human growth. Having to come up with more gold in an emergency, or just because your economy needs to grow, doesn't work when there is a limited amount of mineable gold in the ground.
Some of us want a currency that is a tool for human growth. Others want it to be an investment vehicle and fuck human growth. Guess which side r/bitcoin is on.

Which is exactly my point. Their dollars are the National Debt. If you eliminate the National Debt, you eliminate the dollar itself. Literally the concept of the dollar is rendered null.
But this is r/Bitcoin, so of course people would jizz themselves over the total destruction of fiat currency.
The truly horrifying thing is people thinking a limited, scarce commodity could ever function as a currency.
