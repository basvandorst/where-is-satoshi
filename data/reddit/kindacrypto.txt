Oh no, I need to pay my taxes but all I have is bitcoin. I guess I'll die.

I was just at my bank today; TD Canada Trust. I asked them if they were doing anything to transactions going to crypto exchanges or flagging accounts or anything. She spoke to a co-worker, and checked her computer then both of them said they hadn't see or heard anything like that.
The only warning they had seen come up about bitcoin was there was a scam where someone would send you a money order and want to paid in bitcoin then the money order would fail. it's a classic scam but they get bitcoin at the end instead of cash or whatever.

Wow, the arrogance of bankers boils my blood. It's not that you're wrong or you don't understand what's going on, because obviously you do, it's the *market* that's irrational. *rolls eyes*
Hey quantum mechanics, stop being so irrational and behave. You're just not conforming to my expectations.

Ok, I'm guessing you're about twelve.
It's not that you're wrong or you don't understanding what's going on, because obviously you do, it's that I don't have a background in finance or economics. *rolls eyes*

I wonder how long a class of school children would take to do a full sha-256 hash by hand. If you look at how many schools there are, we might have a possible wetware asic.
No child left behind ;)

IMHO, his time would be better spent having users post questions to  and then answer them there. It's a much more scalable than answering DMs.
But yeah, it's really nice to see that kind of dedication to supporting newcomers.

Yeah, no. The early adopters were either significantly burned personally or knew someone that was significantly burned by the last downturn. You'll never see another run like you did last year, people know better now.
The exchanges are all crooked, near everything in this space is a scam. There is zero reason for the financial industry to adopt bitcoin when they can hire their own programmers to make something functional for themselves. There is zero reason for the public to adopt bitcoin. China already controls most of hashing power of bitcoin, guess how much fun that's going to be when they control 51%.
Bitcoin has no future.

The energy density of gasoline is about twice of batteries. A full tank of gasoline weighs a fraction of a full one. A full battery weighs the same as an empty one. Electric cars will never be a full replacement for hydrocarbon combustion car, ever.

long block time, not-asic resistant, comparably high transactions fees to other cryptos, (good or bad depending on your view) no smart contracts, divided community
but the biggest issue with bitcoin (and every other crypto for that matter) is it's too hard to use for mainstream adoption. I've been a software dev for ten years now and I still get nervous sending large amounts of bitcoin because I'm worried I fucked up somewhere and I'm going to lose that money. IMHO, that's not a risk the average joe would take.

Yes, this. MacAfee gave a talk on crypto and he's mentioned he's lost about 5 grand on shapeshift from mixing up addresses after have "a glass of wine". It's easy to make a mistake, and you can't just undo it or speak to someone to work things out. That's a hard sell to an average person.
@_date: 2017-11-10 04:58:06
Well, it's MacAfee so "a glass of wine" was probably two hookers and an eight ball.

I hope this doesn't sour a lot of people to crypto. How can we stop people getting scammed by bitcoin crash? Run our own ad?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:56:45
There is huge value in crypto now, and people like money. Attacks will be ongoing forever.

Unless they change the source code! Every member of the core team could be against it *now* but what about 15 years from now when the team has been totally replaced?
It's weird to think 15 years ago, google wasn't evil and I totally trusted them with all my data.
@_date: 2018-12-18 20:43:01
If the core team wants it and mostly everyone else doesn't then we'll end up with another schism and another chain. That will happen in the future, even if its not this issue. Look at how many branches of the Catholic church there are. That's all from ideological schisms over time.
Either way, 21 million hardcap is not as forever as claimed

I just use a generic shampoo and it takes care of the inverse or cowlick, or whatever you kids are calling it now. Nice picture, is that a Jackson Pollock?
