That's not true, the national average last year was 59k.

No it's a brand of water bottle haha.

Ok good to know. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:28:14
I wonder if it would work on a rounded surface.

I have a laser engraver at work. This is a video of the exact laser.
I'll PM you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:32:42
Yeah I bought in after the China announcement in September so I'm no expert. What do you mean by the "base" being $5600 - $6300? Like that is where the price is supposed to be right now?
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:57:16
1. Why is sweeping a paper wallet not safe? What could go wrong?
2. I plan on buying more BTC so wouldn't it make sense to do it now instead of putting more on the paper wallet?
3. Are there any rumors of new hardware wallets coming out that I should wait for?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:56:13
Sorry, I don't know how that would work. I use a paper wallet and I don't think I can put Litecoin on it. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:15:10
This isn't me but this is the same laser I use.

I like my old wooden spoon better but my dog ate it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:27:38
Not really worried. Almost all of my crypto is in cold storage in my gun safe along with gold, silver, and a lot of guns. I'm more worried about someone stealing my guns haha.

"I made $100k selling water bottles with this one easy trick!" 
-Future me
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:31:00
Yeah I get to use it for free. The one we have (Epilog Mini Engraver) costs about $25k so I don't think I'll be buying one haha. My boss bought one from China for $5k and it works pretty good. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:13:32
I could probably do that. The laser can't engrave bare metal but it can engrave painted and anodized metal so it just can't be the stainless steel model. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:28:41
Price jumped up $500 in 20 minutes. I spent half as much as I was going to. I'll buy the other half on Monday. Dollar cost averaging and shit.

Ok thanks
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:11:27
But seriously though, if you want one I can make you one. Just PM me.

@_date: 2017-11-21 17:07:15
Yeah it is. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:30:59
If that makes you mad, you'll be furious to know that people have offered to pay me money to engrave their branded water bottle for them. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:00:05
Yeah I bought in after the China announcement in September at $3800 and then again at $5300. I think I'll wait until $6300 to buy again. Hopefully it happens sometime this weekend. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:42:52

Frickin laser beams! 
I have a laser engraver at work. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:00:57
Epilog Laser Engraver. There is one at where I work. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:16:07
Alright but I only accept bitcoin cash! /s
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:38:03
I guess technically I posted this 5 minutes after midnight my time so today haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:25:24
This seems like the smart thing to do. Plus another guy said that there's 80k unprocessed transactions right now.

Do you mean the PNG file of the design? It's on my work computer but I can send it tomorrow when I get to work. How would I send it, do you have an email or something?
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:34:15
Someone should tell that guy who has 200 BTC that his wife doesn't know about. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:53:06
Thanks to whoever originally made this design!
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:16:30
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:52:35
Ok, thanks. I'm not using Coinbase but I'll wait. Is there a way to check the number of unprocessed transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:06:59
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:48:51
Glad you like it!
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:57:47
Jesus Christ! It just hit 160K! What's a normal number of unconfirmed transactions?

Ok thanks. I just don't like giving out my SSN if I don't have to. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 01:07:06
Thanks for the advice. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:18:12
Good to know. I was planning on using bitaddress anyway. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:15:05
Are you saying that I shouldn't do it or that it's not possible? Because I know I can save the image on a flash drive. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:42:04
So these two forks will basically triple the number of coins I have? Will I be able to trade my new BTG/S2X for more BTC? Will it work on cold storage like a paper wallet?
Sorry for the questions, I got in after August 1st so this fork thing is new to me. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:23:58
What does it mean about "claim" your BTG and B2X? Does it mean our BTC will get turned into BTG or that we get free BTG/B2X?
Also, I keep my small amount of Bitcoin, 0.2 BTC, on a paper wallet. Is that safe?
