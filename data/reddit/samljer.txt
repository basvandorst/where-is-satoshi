the hashrate difficulty grows BECAUSE more power goes on the network. not because of any hashing efficiency issue.

whats funny is if you mined altcoins on nicehash
and  you would have actually made some actual BTC value.

no, someone got 50 btc every 10 minutes because theres a new block every 10 minutes. period, regardless of the difficulty.
the difficulty adjusts to KEEP it at 10 minutes not the other way around.
more people mine, difficulty goes up to keep it about 10 minutes between blocks.

without investors buying that power, they wouldnt afford nearly as much of it.

no shit, the fees are for the electricity. 
the contract purchase gives you hashpower equal to about what you wouuld have paid for hardware.
the same shit happens to render farms when new asic hardware hits market and the difficulty skyrockets.
look @ it like a miner, and not an investor and it will
make sense.
its not a scam. its just a different area of the same network youre dealing with.
can you just buy bitcoin and hold? yes
can you mine and make a profit? yes
but without BOTH, the ENTIRE SYSTEM fails.
have there been ponzi scams hiding as cloud companies? yes
 but genesis isnt one of them, in fact, you can go to
thier warehouse if youre local. they open their doors
to the curious.
same as buying the hardware and mining yourself.
except now you dont have to deal with asic upgrades
hardware faults, power outages and other crap
and in exchange you get life term contracts
all you pay them daily is the electric cost.
and lose out on resale of hardware (which doesnt sell
most of the time anyway)
ive been on both sides of the coin, and its about the same
in terms of profit and return on investment
is about the same for both.
edit: its no different then what brick and mortar companies do when they sell out bits
to share risk.
the only reason so many people cry SCAM for cloud mining is because most of them dont
truly have a clue when it comes to investing.
they all look at the same charts at poloniex and think they are pro's over night.
no sorry. 95% of you here dont have an actual fukin clue.
This isnt a get rich scheme, and neither is the stock exchange.
ROI is always going to be long term.
no different then if you did it your damn self in the garage.
theres way too many people that get into crypto without knowing "actually" what it is
they buy some cloud contract or GPU and just mine expecting its some get rich scheme
because some youtuber got lucky and showed it, lied about it (or dont know themselves what happened).
Crypto is as deep or deeper then the stock market, and people go to school for years to learn to be invester brokers. so what chance do you guys think you have if you dont at least learn 2 google?

thats why they gave everyone in zcash free hashrate upgrades, you were compensated and then some.
zcash still crashed, suck it up buttercup
the market crashed, this isnt unique to crypto, the same shit
happens to real stock holders, but they dotn come on reddit bitchin about how its a scam, they learn from the mistake, research better, and go at it again.
cryptos are really not any different then stock
as they are basically just holdings in a company, a companies
idea, etc
look up IPO and ICO.
look up why it crashed, educate yourself.

by your logic the stock exchange is ruining companies -,-
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:20:52
the market failed you, not genesis.
if the coin didnt dive, you owuld have met ROI.
everything hits ROI the time of sale, now
if the coin goes up, you make more, if it goes down, you lose
thats NO DIFFERENT THEN IF YOU BOUGHT THE HARDWARE YOURSELF AND DID IT IN YOUR ATTIC.
so basically, next time choose better.

that comment wouldnt sound so ridiculous if genesis wasnt around for a decade already.

the supply/demand isnt fake
the blockchain knows EXACTLY how many coins exist
because it knows howmany was minted at launch, and
how many are created (out of thin air by the way) with each new block.
as more people want more of it, but supply goes up slowly, the cost goes up.
It also doesnt help that hardware speeds have made it ridiculous.
you can thank the chinese farms for that.
Difficulty has sky rocketed, but block time remains the same.
pretty sure thats your fees.
whoever started teh ASIC movement needs their head examined.
