You could literally google "who invented bitcoins" and get a play-by-play of everything we know about the conception and origin of bitcoins, and why it doesn't even matter who "created it" because it is completely decentralized and isn't owned by anyone.
Tulip mania was really only about the trading price of rare tulips for specific types of goods. There are many theories as to why the crash in price happened, but it is generally agreed upon that a crash did happen. However, tulip mania differs from Bitcoin in a very obvious way: Bitcoin is a payment system as well as a commodity.
Bitcoin is not just tulips. It’s not like you’re only trading back and forth with Bitcoin by handing it to someone in person (like they were doing with the tulips); this thing works like it’s own payment system. There is no middleman, and no governing body overseeing the transactions between people.
I can send you Bitcoin with just my phone and yours, with no one like PayPal, Chase, or Citi overseeing the transaction. This level of virtual payment abstraction is something new to currency as a whole. Never before have we not only seen a new commodity, but a commodity with a never-before-seen payment system.
Bitcoin is revolutionary. It’s like cash, for the Internet. This thing is so staggeringly mind-blowing that it even taxes the ability of the mind to comprehend it. This isn’t some tulip people pick up off the ground and trade directly for pigs or loaves of bread; this is something that replaces the whole bartering system entirely. Not only does it facilitate trade, it is the commodity you are trading with as well.
Therefore, comparing it to a “bubble,” or anything we’ve seen in the past, is incredibly naïve.
There I go, doing your research for you again.

What if they establish a megacorporation? They probably already have one if they were wealthy enough to purchase all that bitcoin. 
Now they are earning revenues that are greater than their expenses. They are not simply holding it inactive. The BTC is still being injected into the economy. But, they don't lose their power. They remain immeasurably powerful. 
Someone couldn't do that with USD because the wealth is already distributed, but could they do that with bitcoin? Ride the wave up, buying a huge amount of bitcoin?

Interesting. Is there a reason it goes based on just mtgox? Every other exchange makes mtgox look hyper inflated.

When you sent the 0.085, that address (LoCG) turned around and sent them to another address. 
It says it split the transaction. 1 BTC to one address, and 0.01 BTC to another adress. 
Here's the part I don't understand. 
1 + 0.01 does not equal 0.085. Not sure what happened there.

There will be 21 million bitcoins. There are really 2,099,999,997,690,000 (just over 2 quadrillion) maximum possible atomic units in the bitcoin design.

The world GDP is 71 Trillion. If 0.05% of the world economy is bitcoin, and only 1% of all bitcoins are used in transactions, then each bitcoin is worth $187,000.

Yeah, that makes sense. Is a campbx.com account secure? Can I just let it sit there?

So your conclusion is that Satoshi was either one person or a group? That's specific.

Yes, you should definitely buy bitcoin now or wait.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:10:26
Okay. So when trading resumes, what are the methods for buying BTC? Why can't I simply link a bank account and go? Coinbase is the only one I've seen that does that. Should I expect their price to be about market average once trading resumes?

I'm gonna go ahead and be the nicest guy right now and let you know that if you are incapable of reading the sidebar and doing some research, you are going to get reamed in these comments. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:47:56
You have decent reddit karma. You have been a redditor for over a year. You're probably a smart person. So, tell me, why can't you READ THE SIDEBAR?
There are tons of FAQs and resources. 
You can't even google "bitcoin mining"? really? How about "what is bitcoin mining"? Or, "how does bitcoin mining work"? Or, "bitcoin mining simplifed"?
@_date: 2013-11-10 02:33:43
I'm glad it's helpful, but I did not write it. It is directly from  which is in the sidebar.
My point was that it took me literally 5 seconds to copy-paste that. He should be doing his research before he comes in all ready to challenge bitcoins.

Okay, hold on while I find you an article proving bitcoin works written by someone who doesn't think it works.

Bitcoin is a technology, not a person. Those articles are written by people who believe in the technology, and have logic to back it up.

Unlike gold, bitcoins are:
    Easy to transfer
    Easy to secure
    Easy to verify
    Easy to granulate 
Unlike fiat currencies, bitcoins are:
    Predictable and limited in supply
    Not controlled by a central authority (such as The United States Federal Reserve)
    Not debt-based 
Unlike electronic fiat currency systems, bitcoins are:
    Potentially anonymous
    Freeze-proof
    Faster to transfer
    Cheaper to transfer 
It is true that bitcoins have no intrinsic value, in the numismatic sense, in other words, value in any realm outside of being used as a medium of exchange.
However, while some tangible commodities do have intrinsic value, that value is generally much less than its trading price. Consider for example that gold, if it were not used as an inflation-proof store of value, but rather only for its industrial uses, would certainly not be worth what it is today, since the industrial requirements for gold are far smaller than the available supply thereof.
While historically intrinsic value, as well as other attributes like divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, durability, helped establish certain commodities as mediums of exchange, it is certainly not a prerequisite. While bitcoins lack 'intrinsic value' in this sense, they make up for it in spades by possessing the other qualities necessary to make it a good medium of exchange, equal to or better than commodity money.
Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network.
Value is ultimately determined by what people are willing to trade for - by supply and demand. 
* Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, and cash all serve as opportunities for criminals as well, but society keeps them around due to their recognized net benefit.
* Hopefully Bitcoin will grow to the point where no single organization can disrupt the network, or would be better served by helping it.
* Terrorists fly aircraft into buildings, but the governments have not yet abolished consumer air travel. Obviously the public good outweighs the possible bad in their opinion.
* Criminal law differs between jurisdictions.

You admit that you don't understand it, yet your attitude is judgmental rather than inquisitive. How do you expect to learn anything?
It's not just a program you download that can have malware hidden on it. It is a protocol for encrypting transmissions. Because the method for verifying these transmissions is distributed across thousands of servers all keeping each other in check, a transaction cannot be faked. You can't just hack the "program" and give yourself a certain number of bitcoins. The number of bitcoins assigned to a particular address is a record held simultaneously by thousands of servers in the "blockchain".
But, again, you didn't make an effort to learn the basics.

Are you kidding me? Give the tiniest amount of effort and do a tiny amount of research before you post this junk. 
One could argue that gold isn't backed by anything either. Bitcoins have properties resulting from the system's design that allows them to be subjectively valued by individuals. This valuation is demonstrated when individuals freely exchange for or with bitcoins. Please refer to the [Subjective Theory of Value](
The Bitcoin protocol was originally defined by Bitcoin's inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, and this protocol has now been widely accepted as the standard by the community of miners and users.
Though the developers of the original Bitcoin client still exert influence over the Bitcoin community, their power to arbitrarily modify the protocol is very limited. Since the release of Bitcoin v0.3, changes to the protocol have been minor and always in agreement with community consensus.
Protocol modifications, such as increasing the block award from 25 to 50 BTC, are not compatible with clients already running in the network. If the developers were to release a new client that the majority of miners perceives as corrupt, or in violation of the project’s aims, that client would simply not catch on, and the few users who do try to use it would find that their transactions get rejected by the network.
There are also other Bitcoin clients made by other developers that adhere to the Bitcoin protocol. As more developers create alternative clients, less power will lie with the developers of the original Bitcoin client. 
SHA256 and ECDSA which are used in Bitcoin are well-known industry standard algorithms. SHA256 is endorsed and used by the US Government and is standardized (FIPS180-3 Secure Hash Standard). If you believe that these algorithms are untrustworthy then you should not trust Bitcoin, credit card transactions or any type of electronic bank transfer. Bitcoin has a sound basis in well understood cryptography.
