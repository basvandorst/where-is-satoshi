Yeah but when they would be able to decrease btc's worth by 50% (which really isnt much compared to some crashes) the publics trust could be shattered for a long time and all alts would join the death spiral.  And even if they wouldnt be able to, why shouldnt they at least try? They know that crypto embodies a big threat to all traditional markets.

Are there any solid reasons why the big Wall street whales shouldn't just use everything they have to short and by doing so destroy bitcoin?  I mean bitcoins purpose was to make them and everything related to traditional banking obsolete. I just cant get my head around why they should even try to make it their own if they could simply stop the revolution.

But wouldnt the initial margin be way to high due to bitcoins volatility and scare off most people?
