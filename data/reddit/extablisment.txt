I wish. :)  He supposedly has enough money, I'm sure i don't, ha ha. I'm gonna publish an article about him on my website in a couple of days that will tell all, tho. Or at least some. I already wrote it some time ago, but now I think it's topical to post. No one will read it but it's just a thing I do anyway. I almost published it a few years ago but James put the kibosh on it when I showed it to him back then. Now I guess he must be prepared to be immune to criticism if he's working the crypto market. :)

Well, here it is... not.  This is not my writing.  Like everything, if you don't get it out the door in two weeks someone else will beat you to it.  I'm still going to do mine but this one is by far better and more journalistic.

Here's the article I promised on him:

What I was thinking is more like a destabilizing event. You can make new Bitcoin yourself, and could also have bought over several years.  If BTC  fell from 15k to 500 dollars over a month it would make news and destabilize the world in terms of the howling the investor class would make
.. thus... Free fUD.  If I was NK or Russia I would be working that angle right now, anyway.  All the big money is having a showdown on this, and the little money is swimming along. I wonder what the price will arrive at when all the players have their cards on the table.  (Buys popcorn and chocolate peanuts). (Narrates actions in 3rd person present tense). Meanwhile, the market itself us dominated by message boards both public and private. Reddit gets quoted as the news writers need free commentary and info, so they publish headlines like "Reddit hodlrs say to hodl through the covfefe.". Thats the actual headline, lol.

Well, maybe maybe not.  I think this recent initiative is too over the top as well.  But he did sell his 2013 book for bitcoins, the first to do so.  That's much more than a year and a half ago.  Well, everyone  who invests in bitcoins has simply gotta be smarter than everyone else, right? No chance they might be the bagholders, right?  Way too smart for that.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:02:21
Let me ask you... If you had billions and you were a hostile entity...  Why would you not manipulate the price of BTC.  Mine it, buy it.. then when a lot of new inexperienced noobs come in..   sell, relentlessly. The total lack of protection against malicious manipulation when inexperienced 'hodlers" can't even spell is a risk that outweighs any possible reward IMHO.  Markets were developed with laws and regulations over centuries for a reason. gLTA, make money while you can, nervous counter parties and failed trades and backlogged systems not with standing...

Aaaaand... the crowd goes wild as the truth is revealed to one and all, lol!!!!

Kevin Salveson predicts the opposite and has been been right and all the others have been wrong so far, so I'm going with Salveson.

I'M FUCKING SERIOUS - Make sure my crown is studded with precious jewels such as rubies and emeralds!!  You know... SOMETHING OF REAL VALUE ha ha!!!
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:45:08
Ha ha, you can give me my award for being smarter than a poisoned nutcase right now to save yourself time.  
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:53:08
Let us keep reminding reddit of how right I have been on BTC. Hopefully it save some of you from getting rooked.
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:26:54
remeber that I wear a size 10 golden crown, all you suckholes getting your heads handed to you... just HODL ha ahaa aha aha SMH

I don't buy that... anybody on Sand Hill would have noticed him on CNBC occasionally for over a decade...  It may be that uncleintel is the one who doesn't exist. However, he is not a Wall Street billionaire asshole, per se. So he is not busy founding XYZCombinator to exploit the naive, I guess.  But hey, there's a million hedge funds out there and every asshole in suspenders thinks he's Michael Milken without the Barney and a master of the multiverse, so who cares what some sand hill douches think?  James is all-right, he's just banking on the greater fool theory and it seems to be working.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:11:41
Naw, that's the opposite of what his writing is.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:04:00
Yeah, he's legit in a lot of ways... not a con artist... but he's using con artist tactics these days, so... buyer beware
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:41:45
Oh, you can't predict the future... so you mean it's worse that a high yield bond because there is no promised rate of return at all, and it could even lose money?  You're trying to agree with me and you don't even know it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:20:02
So... smart... because he's making money selling info that he's packaged into a winning product.  Got it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:19:19
It's the opposite... he doesn't give a shit about tier 1 deals.  He made his  FU money and now he spends a lot of time telling others to fuck off. In fact, all those "respected" VCs aren't worthy of respect, either.  I'd take his word over just about anyone's, actually...
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:06:00
It's odd, but I've actually had some facebook conversations about this with James.  I said I wouldn't publish them at the time, but now things have changed.  He seems like a good guy and he's not necessarily a scammer... but he hooked up with some people who are flogging him in ways I agree look like they borrow all the old tactics and layouts of typical stock picker newsletter. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:52:05
So... it's always good to start off on the wrong foot yet again. If they don't know how to not be used it's their own fault for being born. It's inequality because when a new IPO or a new nation floats a new currency, it's done with regulations and an eye to fairness.  But you're ok regressing?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:48:07
Is it wrong to enjoy the schadenfreude so much?  Look at all the scammed post things on this sub that basically tell them that giving their money to the scam was a kind of noble act. The blockchain lives on even if you all die, lol.   
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:04:29
That is a fantastic piece of writing, every line is another trenchant observation that well reflects and satirizes our real world.
@_date: 2018-11-18 22:00:48
You're welcome, internetz lol. You're welcome like a pearl necklace, ha ha
