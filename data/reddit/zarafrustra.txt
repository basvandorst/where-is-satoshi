I mean when I say infrastructure I mean the established pay-sell line that would ensure that goods are purchased by the store. This is not as simple as it seems - how will stores pay for the goods in bitcoin? 
Mass adoption is either govern mentally forced (case of Euro in EU) or gradually achieved. It cannot be forced by everything else losing value because if BTC is as closely tied to fiat as it currently is it tanks with it.

Attack the ideas not the person thank you.
It seems most of these articles miss my integral point - even today our energy consumption and waste production exceeds earth capabilities. They argue from the point I argued against and I described as sort of a utopian reality in which the "developed world" lives at the expense of the less developed. 
Status quo is not right because it is the established reality, it itself has to be questioned before it is too late. 
However the main question in the future I think will be how useful something is and if there is an alternative, more ecological way to come to the same results. 
Here we will have to question ourselves how much we need those data centers, how much gold we really need. And off course question ourselves if we really NEED the alternative way to define value if it is that expensive. Not in terms of cost but in terms of both energy consumption and waste production. 
This is the big problem with bitcoin. It is a very expensive alternative that the would could do without. And because it is just an alternative it is less ecologically friendly than the flying itself. 
MOst large scale industries are needed even though in the future we will have to redefine what is really needed. For example my sister is traveling to Spain next week for 2 days - round trip by plane. Roughly 800 kilometres. Is that justified? In our reality it is, but I think we will soon be forced to rethink what is justified, or as in discussion what is needed.

I don't know how this is so hard to get. I will have to take time to write up about how impossible this switch would be from the ground up. 
There are so many variances:
- most of the assets/food owners also are money owners. This is just the first hurdle. Not only there is no infrastructure to build the network, even if there is ... there might be huge opposition that could even lead to war. 
When you reference USSR you reference fiat money exchange. Notoriously in Serbia the prevalent money was deutsche mark because it was more valuable. But these currencies are interchangable. The switch to a crypto would be much harder + could be illegal (I can see the crypto being banned the moment money reaches a certain inflation level)
- the infrastructure we already talked about
- I can imagine the situation where if bitcoin baloons to like 400k there might actually be too much money and would cause an inflation itself. Take a look at this example. A computer is considered a luxurious item that is accesible to just selected few (talking globally). Its price is defined by exactly how many can afford it given how much they earn. IF Bitcoin surges to 400k and suddenly there are thousand + new billionares ... the market would autocorrect itself. Having a billion dollars would mean the same as having 100k today. 
- the struggle  for power would definately start a war
All in all bitcoin is making a mess because it exposes how chaotic the reality of our lives is, and that our lives are tied together only by mutual agreements. We somehow forgot this in this struggle for (financial) freedom but I can definately see catastrophic events if somehow bitcoin survives (which it wont. Nobody wants that to happen and if it gets too big will be banned)
Unfortunately I will probably not find time to expand on every point as it would require an essay.

But what do "the wealthiest" use that energy for? Is it not for your new iphone, that new computer game, an electrical car ...   
"the rich" produce items "the poor" want. And if it was not for them somebody else would do it instead. Be it the countries in a communist-like environment or whatever.  
The fact is we all live in this fantasy and do not understand how much we cost the earth with it.
@_date: 2019-05-18 13:55:01
What I think is the problem is the technological waste itself. And I think we will be forced to cut it down in the not so far future.
@_date: 2019-05-15 07:29:08
There is a reason why JP Morgan is still not in the race. Bitcoin is one of the most unpredictable assets on the market right now. I wrote at length that its only value and why it is invested into right now is the hype it generates. No serious investor right now believes in its technology, its unproven, untested and localized to a bunch of geeks. It is essentially betting that the next guy will invest same amount as you have or more ... if somehow that does not happen and if investment firms feel they meet their goal profit it drops astronomically.
Nobody can reliably predict what will happen and taking out loans could have catastrophic effects on next 5 years of your life. Never take out loan if its not necessary. A loan essentially binds you to your current job and current living environment taking a lot of your freedom away. So this is a horrible decision. IF you cant afford to invest in BTC don't invest into it.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:43:38
Neither. My interest in bitcoin is purely theoretical at this point. I sold everything at 6,5. Decent profit, but that is it for me. I see this as being poorly managed, poorly organised, much like almost everything at 2020 very loud off the pitch but no game.   
Bitcoiners still dreaming lambos and pushing this on the market where it will either get crushed or become an asset instead of a tool.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:12:07
Using history to predict the future. Have you not read Hume?   
One day, unless BTC gets recognised for its properties, it will dip to 0. I know you will downvote me but you are essentially buying sand that people agreed is valuable. If a few more say its worthless it will become worthless. Be careful
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:00:00
I will watch this when I have time but my argument is not about the climate change but more about the pollution itself and that someone is paying for the mess we create. Be it the people that clean up after us or the earth itself that can't take it. We live in a virtual world in a heavenlike society where there are no consequences.
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:54:55
Good read, however the main point that is argued in most of these articles is that status quo itself should be used as a reference. However I argued that status quo already far exceeds sustainable energy consumption and waste production.
First thing is that there is a lot of waste produced not only energy consumed with mining. And it is to provide an alternative value. I already said that I see a possibility that for example gaming will either be limited or banned in the same argument. Its cost is simply unsustainable in relation to what it produces. The question is - we already have value storage and value itself. Can we afford to pay for an alternative?
The second paragraph is interesting. It argues that " Paraguay today is the only place where there’s abundant energy ". There is no such thing as free energy. Perhaps in the older moderls but today it is becoming apparent that the whole way we set to live our life is unsustainable. It only looke like it has an abundant of energy but paraguayans and moreso the less developed countries will need to pay the price for this energy to be captured. It is cheap in terms of what we today determine as valuable - you will get more dollars from it than u will lose making it. However the problem is the cost it entails and that it is not measured by dollar.
I am not going to go into the second part of your list because it argues that bitcoin is better. However it does not question what I questioned - is the price we have to pay for a more efficient way of doing things justifiable? Good example would be the fossil fuels. Nobody can argue that this is not the most efficient way to arrive at set goals (be it in industry, war or travelling) However the question that is becoming apparent is if we are willing to pay the cost for this effectiveness. What I argue is that we have to take a closer look into the costs that we have to pay to get this alternative.

If you bought at 3k no doubt you should sell now if its not 100$ of &lt;your lunch money.

Like I argued in another threat fiat is hardly going to be devalued to a critical point because it is in best interest of banks and governments to keep its value. Best example is Greece in EU. Banks essentially are what upholds the value of fiat.
Being an investment vehicle and being a currency in which trades are done is a HUGE jump. In fact I think that the more BTC is used as an item on the market the less chance it has to become a currency in its own right.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:53:02
I understand that however that is the point of instrastructure. Because there is no established trading pattern with bitcoin that would be global nobody would seek to use it in a case of economic collapse and it would collapse along with fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:47:22
Are you stupid? I am explicitly saying small amounts?
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:47:49
Dude you can do better. That was beyond pathetic :)
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:38:08
Yes today.  But its capped right? What happens if it is actually massive?
@_date: 2019-05-12 12:51:22
This is actually the worst possible advice. You are suggesting people to pump money into something that will be worthless in case of crisis. 
With no existing infrastructure the jump to bitcoin during crisis is as possible as Thor saving the earth.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:16:31
Yes. However the gains are only notable with larger amounts of money. And only if you have larger amounts of money you should invest at this time. Like an investment firm maybe
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:01:39
This is not about will it scale and be profitable but about how we as the wealthiest of them all are unable to see how much scaling of everything (including the internet) is ruining the world. At the moment mainly for those who need to clean up after us (the poor countries) but soon for the earth itself as well.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:24:13
Great. 15 people are debating my lines and you the genius of them see the truth :)
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:33:15
that is how every market trader works. They sell most at a decent gain and leave some in the event of the the market item going to the moon. They are not here to gamble, they are here to make profit.
You can expect a lot of investment firm capital dropping out of BTC in next days.

Attack ideas not the person. Attack arguments not the person. But iwth your IT background it is hard to right?
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:59:57
Dude, please stop questioning my intelligence because ...
Pension fund is somewhat guaranteed. The odds to get 6% back are actually in favor and only catastrophic event that would effect everything can make that money dissapear. 
With BTC it is different. There are no guarantees and still the returns are not high enough to actually make money off it. You invest in a stock market exactly because you are somewhat sure of your prediction.
@_date: 2019-05-15 08:02:08
These stories are wonderful. But remember kids for every success story there are thousands of stories of failure. For every crypto in the world there is a similiar story. For every stock. While this story is touching this guy rolled high for maybe once in his life. There are hundreds or thousands that rolled low.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:25:05
9500 at 7000 buy
lets say someone invested 100 € at 7000
Do you really think its worth losing 100 € at this risk to gain what? 35€ ?
And yes if they invested a few BTC at 3k they are selling now.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:20:38
The question is why. Especially since Visa and Mastercard don't "own" the bitcoin market. If what you describe is true and fiat currency would fall to 0 that would actually start a war between bitcoin owners and asset owners at first.
For example. People think that people that own oil would suddenly decide to give up on their money and just sell oil for crypto?
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:23:39
I am not saying there will or there will not be a financial crisis.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:54:43
Honestly that is the problem of bitcoiners. They pushed it on the market as valuable and much like everything else on the market it gets drowned and owned when the big players enter the ring.   
BTC should be introduced to the public as a tool, an opportunity for change. Instead it entered the market as the very thing it is supposedly against.   
That is one of the reasons I think JP never officially got into it. Them entering the ring could totally destroy bitcoin as anything else but an asset. And could either tank it or make it more valuable. But I understand why a lambo owner is not chasing a promise of a lambo.

Gold has value itself. As a metal.

I have said this gazillion of times lately. There is absolutely no infrastructure that would enable a transition like that. 
Even if there is a core infrastructure in place for end-user there is absolutely no infrastructure in relation stores-supplier. 
So it's like you said. In event of economic crysis buying bitcoin would be like throwing the little money you have left - away. Even devalued money normally still holds some value. Its better than 0.

It seems that most answers missed my point on the needless for what I apologise. What I tried to argue is that we, as the developed society need to rethink our basic model of what we think we need. For example a teenage girl will say she needs that cosmetic kit to look pretty but the reality is that it comes at a cost.
Do not kid yourself that simply switching to cleaner energy solves this problem. We already today are finding very difficult to dump all our technological waste and that alone and its exponential growth threatens the planet. 
Imagine mass production of solar panels and wind turbines. Even its production is not the cleanest ... it may be sustainable in our live time. But are we not to expect that the technology and mass abuse of it will in time expand to the whole world? How are we to solve it than?
There is no such thing as zero environment effect. However your question is why I isolated bitcoin? It is because I feel it has to be one of the first to go. First order of business should be to remove everything unnecessary. And since btc is just providing an alternative and doing that with a tremendous cost ... it should be defined as unsustainable
@_date: 2019-05-18 14:03:57
Solar power is not a solution because it too produces waste and the technology itself is a waste in some sense.   
Take it like this. We burn through millions of GPU's yearly to mine. These GPU's are working on providing us with an alternative ... Is it worth producing so much technological waste just to have an alternative?
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:22:40
There is a variety of problems connected to this. Global money is not useful as long as the assets/food/utility owners start accepting this "global money". 
And since these people have a lot of dollar/euro they would probably declare war on our new overlords - the crypto holders.

This is horrible. For example when money is lost to either unfortunate events (dead, kidnappings, faulty hardware ...) it is easily printed with low environment costs. When so much money is lost in bitcoin it would take a lot of computer power to replenish it. This is a huge problem for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:40:00
How would bitcoin maintain value? BTC is defined by fiat, itself it has no value. 
It has no value by itself as long as you can't walk into the store and pay with BTC. Not like today where a service automatically transfers your purchase into dollar the moment the transaction is finalised but when you can actually pay with btc.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:58:50
Simple. Because they got profit from it.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:27:58
Yes but there has to be enough BTC in existence to enable undisturbed transfers.
