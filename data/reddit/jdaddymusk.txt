Bitcoin is not an Abrahamic religion...
Open your mind up a bit more. Not all religions or belief systems are toxic.
I am religious about it because of the kind of future it represents.
We are on the same page 
Cheers to awesome future money

Bro?! How did you figure out my Reddit username?
@_date: 2019-10-23 22:18:24
How do you figure?
Bitcoin is stronger if more people own some BTC and more people will be inclined to purchase once they know more about what makes Bitcoin revolutionary.
Why did you cash out? 
It is like a religion because I believe decentralization is a very valuable thing for our financial system and should also be used in other systems such as the internet in general. It is like a religion to me because I believe that it will continue to grow in influence and change the world.
The key word is believe. I believe in the potential of Bitcoin.
I am not making my financial decisions disproportionately by following my emotions. I make my decisions with the combination of all of my faculties.

Own a piece of it, learn as much as I can about it, and try to spread the knowledge around.
How about you?

Thank you!!

Yessir! Keep stacking friend, you'll get there someday. Buy the dip! Let go of your fear and trust in the reality of this revolutionary technology.
I am not trying to sound too fanatical, but I feel like it's fairly justified.
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:20:30
Thank you, I am going to look into this!
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:40:00
Buy the dip, and HODL! ��

100% agree, and generally I don't. But I just had to share my excitement with the community and hopefully lift some spirits.
