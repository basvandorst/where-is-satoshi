@_date: 2015-02-15 12:07:37
xcp bts 
idc about changing back to real money i want to keep btc going 
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:55:53
there shouldnt even be a fear of losing BTC to a third party 
and u cant make any money if u just sit on them... boring stuff 
i feel with u too eventhough u havent lost any :) 
@_date: 2015-02-15 12:53:34
nah man just follow the transactions that were done 
it always goes to a new add. and splits again 
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:06:21
Nice... if the trading sites continue like that we wont have any chance left to trade by 2016 and BTC will be gone as well 
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:58:42
haha yeah Mtp was fucked up since they changed the owner of the site 
worst prob is all the BTC supporter who have to carry the weight will quit and the exchanges dont have any users anyway

sure thing bro 
i find it weird they only give us a short notice on bter instead of posting it on twitter last post 2 weeks ago, last post on FB was 6 month ago. why dont they give us a chance to get to our altcoins like MtP did. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:41:33
at least that helps a little and i still have a glimmer of hope not losing 14 btc to bter :))
@_date: 2015-02-15 12:30:06
it says their BTC wallet was emptied yesterday
over 7300 BTC 
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:42:31
wait and pray for the good in people
@_date: 2015-02-15 11:29:06
decentralized MARKET.... T_T I need u more than evaa
@_date: 2015-02-15 12:06:22
Funny thing about fear and BTC is that probably most of the traders arent scared of losing money in trades or investment but losing btc to a 3rd party
its like filling up gas at the gas station and u never know if ur car blows up when u put the nozzle in :D
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:57:44
they probably have used an icy &amp; hot wallet haha

UPDATE on Bter!
 "7170 BTC got stolen from our cold wallet in this transaction:
720 BTC bounty for chasing it back.
All wallets have been shut down and withdrawals of unaffected coins will be arranged later.
