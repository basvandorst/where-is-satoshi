this isn't much of a problem for me because I mostly use internet banking so cryptos would be just a different way of my money being displayed if you get what I mean, but I like the security it brings, I Want to try two methods of storage (hardware and mobile) so this will help me, I have some interest in getting into this field since it is very new where I live

Thanks for the tips on the first topic, I will look closely on this, I have an IT background so opening stuff and getting into the intrinsics of this stuff is not that hard for me, also I don't care much about the warranty because where I live it would take half a year to send the product and get back (my country's customs is a joke)
about your second point, there are ways to ensure this has not been done, but I will look into this surely to sleep without second thoughts.
Thanks for the in-depth response, this week and next week I won't have much time due to my university and work, but I will look into everything you said carefully once I have time, thanks bro

I bought from their site (ledger) because I know there is problem regarding scammers, as soon I have time (in two weeks I think) I will verify its hashers and stuff, until then I'll just look at this beauty :p

I kind of already knew this but this was helpful nonetheless, also what got me curious is that you wrote a will, this isn't part of my culture unless you're rich so I will take think about this sure
