Mt. Gox Resigns From Bitcoin Foundation
Robin Sidel
Feb. 23, 2014 10:08 p.m. ET
Mark Karpeles, chief executive of Mt. Gox, the embattled Toyko-based bitcoin exchange, resigned on Sunday from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation, according to a person familiar with the situation.
The move comes as amid a string of longstanding technical issues that began last summer when Mt. Gox halted customer withdrawals in U.S. dollars. The problems became more severe earlier this month when Mt. Gox halted all customer withdrawals, saying that a bug in the bitcoin software allowed some users to alter transactions.
The problems prompted CoinDesk to remove Mt. Gox from its bitcoin pricing index earlier this month.
The exchange told customers last week that it was still working on "reinitiating" bitcoin withdrawals.
Mt. Gox is one of several industry representatives on the board of the foundation, which is essentially a trade organization that advocates for the virtual currency. Charles Shrem, another board member, stepped down in January after being charged with money laundering in connection with his bitcoin company.
A phone call to Mt. Gox's office in Tokyo rang unanswered.

You're right. It's more than stupid but despite that I have no sympathy for a bitcoin messias who now has (estimated) "only" $9.75 Million instead of his $10 Million.

If we assume you only got between 20-40% of the dice sale, that would be 24000-48000 BTC. In your favour we take the 24K and now you lost 550 BTC. That's about 2,5% of your BTC. Some people lost their life savings, so please stop whining!

Who uses some kind of Browser extension for about $2500 and doesn't even have a backup?
@_date: 2016-06-19 19:18:27
My question was legit. Why would you store your coins in some kind of browser extension and don't even bother to backup them? Even if you're a beginner, I never saw a guide, tutorial etc. for beginners where it was advised to use some form of browser thingy!? Everybody knows that when you have something important you better have a backup!

So, I assume you're into Bitcoins since after 2013.

He wasn't really scammed. Their TOS say that you have to start the wiring of the money and then confirming on their page that you did so within 12 hours. It seems to me that he didn't do that so they flagged him as scammer and locked his account.
He send them his paperwork and has now to wait how it's going further. Till now, there was no scamming involved.

I had the same problem because all our utility bills are on my wifes name. I scanned one, photoshopped my name on it, printed it and scanned it again.
No one cared.

The price at the moment is about 118$ but the arbitrage against other exchanges is between 5-10$.
I think this phenomenon is caused by the seized Dwolla account because a lot of people are doing the easy thing and buy Bitcoins at Mtgox and transfer them somewhere else to cash them out. So the price is going up at Mtgox beause a lot of coins are bought but at all other exchanges the price stays still or falls because the Mtgox Bitcoins are sold there.

I made a tutorial yesterday which covers creating a Paper Wallet.
If you want to send some coins out of your Paper Wallet, blockchain.info automatically prompts you for the private key.

That happened to me, too. I sold some coins on Thursday morning and the buyer did wire the money at 10pm on Thursday. The whole banking thing takes 2 workdays, so Friday and Monday did nothing happen and the money was in my account on Tuesday evening.
That's way too long for such a volatile thing as Bitcoins. Bitcoin.de can only be used if you're in for the long run.

I bought BTC at 90$ worth about 3000$ and sold them when SR shut down for 115$ because I thought they would free-fall. No regrets, it could always be better but it could also be much worse.

Both sites are hosted in Germany.
e-l-g.de             : 88.198.231.8 is from Germany(DE) in region Western Europe
bitcoincharts.com: 176.9.79.196 is from Germany(DE) in region Western Europe
Seems to me the hoster did something wrong. Perhaps the routing isn't right.

The normal gap between them two is about 1-2$. Since yesterday they're drifting more and more apart till a 10$ gap this morning. So it seems something happened to get this going but I don't know what!?
@_date: 2013-05-01 22:21:20
I can only support this! Do a EU SEPA transfer which is without cost and your account is loaded in no time. I'm from Germany too and did this several times!
There's no need to use MTgox in Europe.

Bitstamp.net using an EU SEPA transfer to your bank account. Costs should be 90cents.
@_date: 2013-06-21 17:35:47
I did get the news about getting USD out of Mtgox but I didn't make the connection between the prices on the two exchanges. I mainly trade in EUR so it wasn't that big of an issue for me. But sorry for asking I didn't know that there are professional brokers all over the place.

Thanks, but it was not necessary. I have my own Bitcoin Reddit Fund ;-)
If you're using RES, there's even a Bitcoin tab where you can do some settings, especially blend in a bitcointip button aside from the answer/comment button. It also shows a verification for the transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-07 18:04:11
I suppose you meant bitcoin.de?
I used them before, too. The problem was for me that it isn't a real exchange but wiring money around with some strangerswhich takes a lot of time. I switched over to bitstamp and everything is really smooth and I never had some problems there.
Cashing out isn't expensive and every wire transfer I did was in my bitstamp account in about 1-2 days.

The same here. Normally nothing IT related gets past me but I missed the Bitcoin "start". I got in at 10$ but only with 200$ because I didn't trust my instinct.
When they were at 130$ 2 weeks(?) ago I let my father convince me not to put 6K in. He thought they were too high. Better make your own choices...

I made a tutorial the other day for what you did. Perhaps you can use it if someone else wants to make something similar.
