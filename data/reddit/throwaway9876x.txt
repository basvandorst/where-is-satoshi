Im having trouble making a withdrawal because apparently their automatic withdrawal system is down and they apparently dont have anyone who would be able to process a withdrawal manually. I havent received my funds in 3 months, although 2 separate withdrawals were initiated during this period
Coinbase appears to be a scam, as its crazy that an institution dealing with funds is so incapable of basic processes

Sorry, Josh. But the previous comment is correct. My funds have been missing for 3 months and after 2 failed withdrawals your support has only given me a run around as they are completely unsure what is the cause of the failed withdrawal. The reason Im posting on reddit is as this appears to be the only forum where you are in any way accountable to your customers&amp;users

Ive requested a withdrawal on July 24th which was due to reach my bank account a few days later. Even though my bank account is in the same bank as Coinbase (LHV), the withdrawal has yet to reach me. Ive reached out to Coinbase via email, forum and the only thing that is clear now is that they do not have any banking department who would be able to resolve this nor is their IT able to locate the cause why automatic transfers do not work.
Made another withdrawal on the 4th, still nothing by today.
To other users considers putting their funds into Coinbase- DO NOT DO SO! You cannot put faith into a financial institution which is unable to keep track of funds.  Speed and accuracy regarding deposits and withdrawals is vital. Coinbase is a scam! Dont put your funds there
