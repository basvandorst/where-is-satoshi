Something like that - broken laptop with bitcoins inside happened to me few years ago. It was pocket money that time, but now I'd have a lot of extra fun))) I'm doing backups (offline only) ever since =)

Many  don't use core because AFAIK (correct me if I'm wrong) the only was to use it is to download the full blockchain that is damn a lot of disk space and the synchronization... Let's say I'm now having not the best internet connection in my life and will stay here for a few weeks. To use the core I will have to keep that software running almost 24/7 to be up with the network, and that's not cool ))) Core is for servers IMO, even if we aren't speaking about UI etc

@_date: 2018-01-18 17:40:52


IMO that 's hard to happen right now. Even if bitoin go X10 in a year, say 10k investment would be 100k. Not so rich, not very quick, and you have to get spare 10k first =) not any one has that
Compare that with investing 1k to BTC in 2011 selling for $1000 per one 2012 or 2013 during the first peak =))
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:54:03
Top-Ranked by whom? Correct me if I'm wrong but this exchange appeared out of nowhere not so long, there is no contact info available and no company data, etc. And now it claims to be  with 240k users in hour LOL. I believe coinbase got 1 million a month, but this

Yes they are legit, and I like their instant payouts after buying/selling - the fact that they don't hold our funds is very important, at least for me

 this service seems to have the best price for AUD as I can see, although I used them only for SEPA - can recommend this exchanger
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:41:48
yeah, and I believe porn users will love such option, adult industry had already adopted some new technologies, so this can be really huge step forward!
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:25:38
Good. Will compare the prices. It's not so important, what fees exchanger takes - the most important is what rate they use. Sometimes it's better to give 3% then 1%, if 3% seller uses the higher rate :)
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:54:23
Great news, hope India will do smth like this in near future - that's where bitcoin really will be interesting for millions

Because no one really know if these altcoins will be here tomorrow; in case of bitcoin it's much more stability... there are too many bitcoin-based businesses, blockchain-based startups etc already, although altcoins are still used very rarely (besides speculations)

..and buy some bongcoin)) or any of marijuanacoins
@_date: 2014-11-28 23:06:20
I totally agree. When you are interviewed, you should ask the reporter to show you the whole article before publication, otherwize it can be far from what you expected - bitcoin-related or not...
@_date: 2014-11-29 04:26:52
I understand why .bit is not popular - "normal" people won't see your website is the main reason of course))) 
But what so hot about .io I wonder? Damn, now you can have .trade for exchange, .restaraunt for restaraunt etc etc; there are lots of general extensions with some meaning like .pro etc
What exactly .io suppose to mean?
@_date: 2014-12-23 22:42:29
I'm already using  demo account and probably encountered few issues, where to report it?
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:21:41
Great, now it seems to be the best way to buy bitcoins with SEPA, thanks guys!!!
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:10:09
I'm using 247exchange for a while, and can confirm that their rates are very nice, especially for buying bitcoins from them. Although I would recommend to send SEPA transfer instead of using CC, you will get significally more bitcoins =)))
@_date: 2014-05-24 16:37:51
in fact it's almost mainstream already) it will not die, but of course bitcoin in 5 years will be very different from what it was at the moment of "birth"
@_date: 2014-11-29 02:59:35
That depends. I am not sure that story would be publicated without interview with local businessman accepting bitcoin, so if the guy refused to give his comments without knowing the whole story, the journalist would lost Chicago "connection". Anyway, that journalist is a prick, unfortunatelly he's not the only one((
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:54:41
Avesome! By the way, what's this all about - anyone knows what's the reason of this sudden jump?
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:03:43
Russia wins the prize =) I believe this is the first case of penalties for bitcoin use
@_date: 2014-10-04 09:20:45
This is crazy. So, even linking to bitcoin software or miner will cause a fine! Hope the project will not pass...
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:52:20
I like the services of  they are pretty fast with new clients identification etc and have very nice rates
@_date: 2014-11-29 04:19:49
Okay, good that we have future journalists knowing that bitcoin is not only for drugs =)
@_date: 2014-11-29 03:06:04
Like someone told, it's not important what they say about you - it's important that they say something about _you_
OP: there is always a good side. For example, if I will ever be in Chicago area and will need a bike, I will definitelly use this shop. I believe, your brother-in-law will get more positive from this anyway - at least everyone with a head can understand that even if bitcoins are used buy drugdealers etc, that do not make your relative a "bad guy". 
Damn, everybody takes USD that is also used by all kinds of maniacs, child molesters etc, so what?
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:10:59
Great, I'm in)
@_date: 2014-10-04 03:04:17
Seems like you can't see their rates without making an account - I prefer not to use such websites. Also, both Circle and Coinbase are more like wallets than exchangers IMO, when I need to buy bitcoins I like to store it myself (not want to be GOXed)).
So, I am choosing 247exchange - they are "pure exchangers" that will fund your bitcoin account directly. Direct bank transfers allowing instantly buy bitcoins are another feature I love) and I hope they will continue to expand the number of banks connected. 
And the price is really good! Right now they sell 1 bitcoin for EUR 292.89 (all fees included) and let's say at bitcoin.de last price is 293.95! Also, using 247exchange.com you will not need to create any trade orders etc, just send the money online and your bitcoins will be in wallet in few minutes.
That's why my exchanger of choice is 247exchange (at least at the moment).
@_date: 2014-10-04 00:45:19
Bans used to do the opposite many times - remember this one 
I imagine next step they will ban WU, MG and other Money Transmitters (sounds crazy, but let's say India banned transfers abroad quite long time ago). So there will stay only illegal underground Money Transmitters (and Bitcoin Exchangers), people will have to use it and pay crazy fees, often they will be scammed.
So, who will win in that case? Clearly not the citizens and not the country budget - but corrupt officials, criminals etc.
Hope the govermnent will finally understand that regulation is much better then prohibition, especialy when we are talking about the progress...
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:04:42
Interesting, I want to try. Did I understand correctly - I shoud create account at 247online.trade, not at umex.com?
@_date: 2014-08-09 09:40:57
Nice service, I liked it. Withdrawn bitcoin to my okpay account in few minutes, and the fee was even better than okpay provides itself. Voting for you to add NXT crypto as soon as possible)

Great, I hope other EU countires will share the same approach!
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:42:30
I believe coinbase/circle sell bitcoins for USD only, and do not allow European cusomers
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:26:44
 or just use bitcoinwisdom, the best of its kind IMO

It's a great decision to get into bitcoins, but to save money in xbt - I believe it's not so good... bitcoins are great to spend them, not to store the value (at the moment at least)
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:27:36
Unfortunatelly this is common practice. If you'll check bitcoin exchanges for example, you'll see that MUCH of them are breaking US regulations serving US customers without any licenses. Try to check "big chinese" exchanges etc...
@_date: 2015-01-28 07:14:13
Licensing will not 100% protect from thieft, professional steal too you are right, and some are doing it professionally)))
But at least, licensing will protect users against incompetency. I remember the cases (especially few years ago) when exchanges were hacked because the software was written by a kid without no experience, or all the clients funds blocked by banks etc because the owner did not know a thing about AML etc and even used his personal bank account for the business.
Of course professinals fail too.. but at least not so often) And when people, especially newcomers are scammed by the exchange operators or their funds are lost - I believe some are losing faith to cryptos in general.
So, in my opinion regulation is not bad at least. Can't say that I like high "entry fees" for startups, I would prefer if there will be more options for new businesses to enter the market (grace periods etc). But I am against the situation when virtualy any one can run financial service - remember first bitcoin exchanges and their fails...
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:04:44
This is a kind of payment processor (but underground one without any licenses etc) used mostly by HYIPS, ponzis, pyramids etc. I'm not sure who'll need to use this when there are many reputable wallet providers around
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:19:51
Right. The only thing, is that few months ago many people (including me sometimes)) supposed the same when price was $500+
Thanks God there are altcoins, that can help to recover from such losses - but unfortunatelly investing in "hot" altcoins can't be panacea all the time...
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:51:46
Right, but the most important is that exchange is really not something that "average Joe" should run. Look at MtGox etc - I think it's fair enough that only professionals with money and experience will be allowed to work with other people's money.
@_date: 2015-05-29 08:09:27
Yeah, as "normal" bitcoin user I hate the volatility, but as trader I love it))
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:56:57
I like the service so when I see some posts about it, I am posting my experience. I would not call it promoting and personally I think that you are maybe too "suspicious". It's like I will tell that you are promoting virwox because you posted here two times that it's best choise))))) Anyway good luck in your search
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:02:49
Damn, I missed the whole fun. Real roller coaster ride!
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:27:56
Every time the price falls down significantly, my first thoughts are "probably Satoshi started selling off his millions". Although he did not, I believe sooner or later he will do something with his stack. Otherwize, what was the point in starting the project?
@_date: 2015-01-30 20:01:34


Tha's what I'm pointing to. "Normal" exchange Bitstamp continued working even after hack, and I believe the clients will not suffer from the hack. Imagine what would happen if some shady exchange run by unknown people was hacked...
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:55:52
Great article, I especially like the comparison with Internet and newspapers!
@_date: 2015-01-13 20:13:23
Well it's up to you to choose any service you like. I don't see anything fishy in recommending the service I'm using. By the way my account has longer history than this relatively new exchange)
@_date: 2015-05-23 00:34:20
Great move, congrats!
@_date: 2015-01-17 02:00:55
Nice try! The "crypto of my dream" I guess will be something like Bitlesscoin but without crazy volatility as well - Bitcoin without miners, with parity to some precious metal or maybe fiat currency like USD or EUR ;)))
@_date: 2015-01-24 20:20:59
Nice! How you are paying to your suppliers in bitcoin by the way - do you use something like bitpay or how you and other party manage volatility risks? I like this idea but can't imagine my suppliers for example will take the risks of accepting bitcoins. Probably your business is different, suppliers are making 50-100% from every sale and they don't care to loose a bit, or... ?
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:21:23
Damn, you made my day)))
@_date: 2015-01-13 09:49:35
Actually it's  without "s" - I'm using it for a while and have only the best experience.
What certification do you mean? They publish their MSB license at the website or you meant something else?
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:58:46
I believe that the best option will be to make a link to bitcoin wiki, "buy bitcoin" page. This way, the one can find the most suitable exchange service for him. I don't like the idea to make any _one_ service to be like "recommended by administration", in decentralized world of bitcoin the user should have the liberty to be free from someone's preferences etc.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:11:45
Interesting graphs, although it's hard to say something exact based on it. Only thing can be clearly seen is that DOGE had less tweets in second part of 2014 - but to speak the truth I expected that ppls will forget the doge faster...

From one point - a agree. From the other - if no one will spend the money, the money will be dead. So - spend your bitcoins (including selling sometimes) but don't forget to buy again! =))
@_date: 2015-05-01 03:35:19
Well if you have nothing to do, sending money transfer in person is a lot funnier. But I prefer bitcoins =)

It would take a lot more for such spike, but for bitcoin as a currency and its use it would be better if it will not rise or fall. Loans are one of they key funcions of the money, and who he hell will borrow something that today has $250 value, but tomorrow will be $1000?
@_date: 2015-07-04 01:54:59
Lol, I imagine if bitcoin rate will seriously fall during the "service", or if the transaction will not be confirmed and wonder what the girl will do) 
Seriously speaking, there may be a market, because I believe such businesses have issues with CC processing (even where the business is legal). But I've seen a lot of examples who accepts card without any problems at all.
So probably porn rather than sex industry will be better market for bitcoins...
@_date: 2015-07-24 23:11:44
I don't think that this symbol will be popular, it doesn't look like something currency- or money-related at all))

@_date: 2016-02-13 02:17:49
IMO their is no point to "over-control" for the regulators. If they would ask say any exchange to report any deal, they will be overloaded with the papers and will not be able to find anything usefull from that.. so their will be no point in that reports

probably some part of 15+4k fine the executives paid will be shared among them))
@_date: 2016-02-20 08:11:33
Exactly my point. Although I prefer Blockchain's MyWallet. Heard some scary stories about problems with the keys etc but seems it's vague rumours from the past...
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:18:38
I liked the interview, thumbs up!
@_date: 2016-02-12 17:12:29
They might be. Why do you think no one knows who is Satoshi Nakamoto? ))
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:27:01
Great idea! But maybe you'll create something to organize future entries. I.e. if I want to write about MtGox or smth like that)) where I should put a new article?
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:09:05
As I can see it's nothing to do with bitcoin, it's about unlicensed money transmittting and stuff like that...
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:00:10
I think people would love something like "BitGold" but AFAIK all such assets/altcoins etc were actually kind of centrilized. 
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:01:14
Same for me, wouldn't evern been here if not Bitcoin - discovered all other subs much later than r/bitcoin )))
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:23:06
hahaha thanks for reminding to look that movie again after all these years)
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:56:32
Nice! Maybe it really is, who could imagine today's phones 30 years ago)))))
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:08:12
Great, did not know that - thanks for explanation!
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:16:59
I think that all this "bitcoin is dead" just proves that it is not. Nobody will speak about "somethng's" death so long a after all)))
@_date: 2015-07-31 22:53:36
I hope so, but as far as there will be criminals, AML/KYC will never completely disappear
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:04:22
I'd recommend to spend online better but if I'm not mistaken Neteller wallet can be funded by Bitcoin without problems, check their deposit options!
@_date: 2016-02-12 15:57:43
USD as well)))
@_date: 2016-02-13 02:22:19
I do. Can't say I never used drugs)) but never used bitcoin to buy it; IMO good old cash is much better if you need to buy something secretly
@_date: 2016-02-02 17:37:48
Probably it's the best advice. As far as I can understand Bitcoin can't be used for smth like direct debit transactions. A reminder for payment and subscriptions is very different things. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:35:00
Super ))) I'm interested is there any "real" bitcoin plates, or just "btc" ones because most countries allow just 3 letters in plates
@_date: 2015-07-31 17:42:38
I believe it already is...
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:01:01
Junk food, but I love this one:  and I'm not into sweets... will be happy to by one with bitcoin)))
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:54:49
jajaja LOL I miss this place )) and like the video)
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:11:41
IMO it's a way easier to create a list of websites you should visit, not avoid... unfortunately a great % of bitcoin-related websites are scams or run by idiots don't know what they are doing (mtgox and 1000 and 1 copies), too bad bitcoin.wiki lacks moderation
@_date: 2016-02-12 15:52:22
It probably had in the past, but now bitcoin is overgrown all this dark sh IMO
@_date: 2016-02-13 02:20:33
Of course I might being wrong, but how you can understand how much of bitcoins are currently "dark-web-related"? I believe if there would be such stats, regulators would be "super horny" about BTC already)))
@_date: 2016-02-13 02:15:19
I thought the opposite. You control the keys yourself, so what are the risks?
@_date: 2016-02-13 02:13:53
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
@_date: 2016-02-12 15:57:09
I don't see a lot of changes coming, almost all exchanges (bitcoin ones as well as fiat2fiat ones) are regulated already. Maybe they will prohibit to sell prepaid cards without showing IDs or smth like that - but what it changes for ordinary people?
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:10:37
What's wrong about it? Use it for month without issues
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:24:27
Probably 90% of it.. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:01:23
@_date: 2016-02-12 16:24:38
They mentioned websites they used for analysis, althought I don't remember the names. it should be somewhere in the slides
@_date: 2016-02-16 05:55:35
Will check it out, didn't know that
@_date: 2016-02-26 16:58:26
Paper wallets stored in secure location (safety deposit box) or maybe I'd create encrypted wallet.dat using Bitcoin Core and put in safe location if we are speaking about really long term... Second option is much better I believe, jst make sure that the device you used to run the Core was perfectly safe
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:17:51
If he hodl till 100k+ that won't be stupid buy =)) I was  blaming myself once when I bought at 1000, thanks God I still own some of that "stupid money" )))

@_date: 2018-07-03 19:38:49
They probably thought it's Satoshi )))
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:16:58
WOW!!! can't wait to test at least few of these 400k locations)
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:54:38
Always was wondering, are there other scaling options besides hard forks by the way?
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:59:10
Don't they ask you like 3-4 random words out of these during the restoration? IMO few tries and you'll be able to log in
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:42:44
They just try and will change their opinion IMO like China Russia etc
@_date: 2015-04-28 13:20:41
I did. I am currently trying this option, and earlier I paid with the credit card and bank transfer. All was great.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:56:03
LOL @ scriptless scripts ))
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:34:49
I agree with ButtStamp, if freelancers all over the world will be paid in crypto, e-merchants will start accepting bitcoins faster
Let's say freelancers from India, CIS (Russia, exUSSR etc) and other developing countries frequently have problems with their PayPal accs etc. Cryptos will work there, and as soon as freelancers will be paid in cryptos, they will laso spend it. And the merchants will follow the demand.
So, freelancers paid in crypto =&gt; wider bitcoins acceptance!
@_date: 2015-04-11 01:57:03
We'll see who will be the last one to laugh =)
"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win." at least you are on the second level)))
And btw I like someone said about these business teachers "Who knows, does; who cannot, teaches others"
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:16:23
So true)))
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:30:45
Blockchain wallet is another good option, the worst is using god damn QT client IMO :)
@_date: 2015-11-25 04:28:10
Great, I hope there will be more such articles to show the world that bitcoin users are not terrorists and drug dealers ))))
@_date: 2015-11-24 04:30:05
Was not aware of that, but seems to me that was not blockchain's fault. Anyway will check it out, 10x for pointing me in this direction
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:38:05
yeah, this will work))
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:33:16
Is not there any options that will allow to store the value in USD or EUR ? I supposed most of programs work like that
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:42:04
+1  I'm not sure if that friend is not an imaginatory one)))
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:40:07
Sorry i meant 
I like the following: 
"We are not a bank; you retain complete ownership of your Money. We cannot view your balance, see your transactions or make payments on your behalf."
"Blockchain.info uses industry standard AES encryption to protect your wallet from thieves and hackers. The amazing part is the encryption is all done within your browser, before it is saved on our servers, so not even we have access to your account!
My Wallet builds on the security of bitcoin by providing a host of features to help you keep your money safe including Paper Wallets, Offline Transactions, https:// and Remote Backups."
and a lot of other cool things - best wallet IMO
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:01:14
Great but where is the damn ground? )) For the BTC price
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:51:11
Damn! The name Bomberman transfered me into the childhood)))) Can't remember when I heard it last time
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:57:45
Yeah, right now it's good if you can sell @ Bitstamp, buy @ Btc-e and repeat repean repeat =))
@_date: 2015-11-25 04:34:04
The best thing in bitcoin is that it's no need to have "all in one" solution. I use web wallet and independent exchange broker allowing me to instantly deposit/withdraw any time I need. The safest and most independent way to work with bitcoin IMO
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:55:15
Right! the spirit to hold it the only thing you need... but of course if you could fel when to sell and rebuy below, you'll have much more BTCs =)
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:59:46
Well generally speaking you shouldn't buy ANYTHING you can't afford to lose. Even damn MasterCard )
@_date: 2016-05-20 04:01:13
Not so sure. Let's say I borrowed 33 BTC from someone... I would hate if that would be trippled in USD value ))
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:47:17
Well, I can understand why ppl use their bitcoin wallet - but why use their "USD wallet" instead of say, paypal?
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:43:19
Seems they have nothing else to do rather than that, Albania is financial capital of the world etc etc ))
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:49:19
LOL nice one)))
@_date: 2017-07-01 13:09:47
Nice list, what price do you consider as "the moon
 by the way? ))
@_date: 2017-07-01 13:14:52
+1 was shocked to see so many posts about the guy here today
@_date: 2017-07-01 13:16:50
Or if you saved some of the addresses just use any block explorer ))
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:03:24
IMO, at the moment bitcoin is a really awful currency because of the volatility, but is a very very promising payment system. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 00:20:24
Ended 159 days ago damn, and I can't see what price was suggested. Thanks for info anyway! Can't believe I missed it, I am very interested in bitcoin legal status in various countries and if the price wouldn't be significant I would buy and try to monetize the website...
Or it would be great if the dev could post his data somewhere... 
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:55:23
Jesus was crucified "for us" by our damn ancessors... so I believe someone else should be called so
@_date: 2017-07-01 13:19:34
Haha cool. Well with $100k per BTC I believe my wishlist would be not bad as well... so see you at that world trip then))))
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:41:26
HAhahah you made my day )))
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:46:46
Such things are usually written in the contact you sign receiving that $10k
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:23:02
Great, thanks for taking time and making it! I will look maybe will be able to add smth
@_date: 2017-07-01 13:12:45
LOL)) seems to be true after all)
@_date: 2015-02-11 09:32:14
If you don't use bitcoin account daily, that does not mean you don't use it at all. If you'll check any payment systems, bank etc you'll see that most of accounts are rather inactive.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:12:34
 even the "time machine" don't help((
@_date: 2017-07-29 11:30:47
I dunno who creates such poor names like "Ethereum Classic", "Bitcoin Cash" (and few more "bitcoin smth", damn!) etc... Imagine let's say payment processor with payment options:
Bitcoin / 
Bitcoin Cash / 
Bitcoin Classic / 
Bitcoin Unlimited / 
Ethereum / 
Ethereum Classic / 
IMO that would be too damn confusing to users, especialy newbies ("if I bought some ETH today - is it normal or classic?") - so these won't become really popular because of poor merchants etc support. But of course I can be wrong, just my 5 cents)
@_date: 2015-11-23 12:31:31
It should be weekly at least ))))
@_date: 2016-05-20 03:59:08
Interesting approach. I haven't expect this to speak the truth
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:56:04
Right, who needs houses at the moon anyway ))
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:40:24
+100 seems that many people arguing about that don't understand much details ut for some reasons consider it smth personal
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:52:43
lol)) but it's right statement anyway)
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:22:28
 ? but if you want to buy not for trading purposes and if you don't posess fiat balances at all these it's rather useless because there are funding fees etc and depositing process will take some time - so the cheapest exchange can easily become the most expensive
@_date: 2017-06-05 05:27:33
out of curiosity: what can be the point to spam the network with such transactions?
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:23:34
great one, unfortunately they update it very very rarey and it lacks a lot of hot markets...
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:46:46
Damn! just one operation? what amount it was? and maybe it was some shady dealer from localbitcoins etc who's transaction flagged alarm consiering you are into money laundering etc?
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:09:58
Probably because almost no freelancers and almost no jobs there...
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:58:52
There are a lot of "bitcoin cards" on the market, and should be offers with smaller loading fee
or just make bigger transactions )) when loading card
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:39:21
Made my day ��
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:37:02
Seems the next bull run is very very near )))
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:57:45
Not everyone can bank in US. But you are right, -100% is rather impossible because probably all the countries has such an insurance... at least partial. My mistake)
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:53:12
I understand. But if I were the owner of the website, I'd created something to make people registering there - otherwise what's the point? There were some dead or almost dead "jobs 4 bitcoins" websites before so there should be a reason for people to use this one or any one else because there is elance etc... bitcoin to fiat exchanges are not THAT expensive anyway
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:44:56
You can allways buy back)) no reason to cry)
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:11:14
It was like a year ago or smth
Now it's more like "forget the blockchain, it's all about teh ICOs" I believe ))
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:56:49
cool thanks, I was always curious where this came from )))
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:43:37
AFAIK most or all the "??? Times" are in english, at least the ones I've seen in many different countries
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:40:22
I wouldn't call Albania, Mongolia, Russia, India, Congo etc. "the first world" and seems that such insurance exists almost in all contries, at  least the wikipedia itself says "Explicit deposit insurance is a measure implemented in many countries..." 
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:55:42
There are accounts with great amounts (Satoshi's coins etc), the one who'd buy all the bitcoin would spend all the world's fiat money based on current rates IMO))
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:41:52
Well I know how the things are going in different countries. Most of my life I was leaving in developing or "third world" countries and have seen and felt what's financial default is. Anyway, the central bank even in Somalia is not the same as "one guy from the hood". And my point is was that you would get some of your money back after rge bank collapse even in Congo... please everyone stop saying me that I'm sort of rich gringo and know nothing)) I never told that your money are 100% safe with bankers etc etc
@_date: 2017-06-10 13:51:59
IMO the honest couldmining companies would never give great (comparing to bank deposits/loans etc) returns - and all who promise it are just some sorts of ponzi schemes
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:39:40
The only thing is that sometimes it's like -XX% a day
From the other hand, bank account can be -100% day too if the bank collapses))
@_date: 2017-06-11 08:01:14
Maybe the reason is ICOs that are booming right now
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:51:02
etc - there are few indexes like that
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:16:15
It's probably too early for that... even global blockchain is something that many people don't know according to the TC for example )))
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:27:40
Got it. Well I'm glad your coins are safe and although the laziness can be good thing sometimes but not when it's about security =)
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:48:48
I believe such practice is banned in many countries. Some merchants do offer "cash discounts" anyway, seen that in different countries
