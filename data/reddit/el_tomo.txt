Can you withdraw them with bitcoinbuilder?

I suppose the way I was looking at it I'm not investing money I can't afford to lose and even if I bought at another exchange or had them in a paper wallet, a flaw could be exposed that breaks the currency entirely tomorrow and it would all be worthless. Not likely but it's always a possibility. I wasn't really hoping for the price to spike on mtgox but I believe it will go back to around 1000 again this year, I probably won't even sell then but if I can get the bitcoins out them it was a steal. But I guess that's the million dollar question.
Instinct tells me that hey won't go 'out of business' in the next 6 months but I suppose it's the risk/reward payoff. Potential 1000% return in 12 months is pretty tempting since I can only lose 100%

So what they don't actually have the bitcoins they say they do, like a Ponzi scheme? I know that cash withdrawals have always been a problem but do you not think you'll eventually be able to get bitcoins out?
From what I've read on here most people seem to think that it will get resolved, everyone will leave, and then the next generation of 'idiots' will jump back on it.
I'm probably the current generation of idiots I'll admit I've been trading on there for the past 6 months and have been ignorant to a lot of the problems, my attitude was I wasn't planning on withdrawing for a long time so hopefully issues would be resolved.
Do you really think there is a real risk that the whole exchange will collapse and no one will get they're money/btc out?
Cheers for the reply btw it's much needed advice
