Which countries have outlawed it? I’m unaware  and I don’t think this is an accurate statement. Bitcoin itself is not ‘illegal’.

Why would anyone WANT btc ETF’s???

Essentially yes.

Wow this is so cool that you put this in detail. I don’t mean to offend anyone, but hearing that first 911 call made me laugh out loud several times at the sheer brevity and insanity of it all. I’ve heard of swatting but never heard the actual call. This is so nuts. You believe this was completely random based on a tweet? I can’t believe someone could be that cruel to someone on a whim. Good luck!

Can someone give me an objective reason on why BCH is bad? If the markets get big again, won’t the same BTC clogs happen, freaking out retail investors; allowing BCH to mop up the spillage?

lol. I’d say virtually anything. Untraceable money bro.

If you’re in the states, the original method you purchased BTC will show a detailed history transaction. And if you just declare the loose amount and at which price you should be fine

Isn’t this just going to recreate last nov-dec but more frequently?

There will for sure be 3-5 alts that grow to be as big or close to what BTC has done over next few years. Whether a huge company acquired one, Starts their own or integrates an alt like BAT, it might all be luck.

Monero is literally supporting the worst crimes in humanity however. It’s a super smart investment I’m just too soft to make it.

I agree with most of what you’re saying and have also feared and speculated this for a while. I don’t think everything will tank, because 2008 was a very specialized market within a huge conglomerate of banks all colluding, while playing ‘dumb’ which wiped out many’s savings, retirements etc. 
On the other hand, BTC had its HUGE opportunity last year but it’s lack of speed, increasing in fees and the seemingly harder ways to mine due to millionaire setting up their own hyper speeding systems to out pace everyday miners which originally made it all great- sort of took that away. 
I worry about BTC now, and I never have worried before. Primarily because they cannot seem to get their shit together concerning everything I mentioned above. It’s now a year later, and we still have the same issues if not more- yielding less retail investors and giving the media’s never ending smear campaign more credibility in the eyes of the exact retail investors’ trust, which BTC et al genuinely needed for it to continue to gain traction and publicity to be what it originally sought out to be.

Yea it definitely isn’t great for the small guy on there trying to compete with the same items shipping from amazon at lower prices— however I don’t think this will reflect much in AMZ actual stock price. And with the govt contracts it has just been seared with it’s closed services means I doubt we will see anything in the form of anti-trust anytime soon.

Yea, but the huge growth and general public’s excitement from last year has died. Because of the high fees and the learning curves etc.  All I’m saying, is let’s say it does finally do and work like it was always intended to... after people experienced what they did- it’s gonna be a hard sell to convince those same people it’s worth it this time around, especially when the coverage on it has always been shit. It’s just gonna have to be adopted by most merchants which will just take much more time. Which is fine.

If anyone is looking to make a quick buck, sure amazon probably isn’t the way to go right now. But for true long term investment. Meaning a 5-10 years amazon is still a goldmine IMO
