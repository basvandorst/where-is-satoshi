The hotline isn't to "stroke their ego", it is to prevent them from KILLING THEMSELVES.
Stop being an internet tough guy.

You think $6 is a lot?
You can just transfer your bitcoins to another trading company before you sell if that bothers you.

Thank you!
If I had some at this point I'd tip you! :)

What are your thoughts? This is a particularly interesting article and almost damning evidence, looking at the largest transaction. I want to think otherwise though!
edit: please don't downvote me just because I have brought a criticism to the table. One I am not even making personally, might I add!

Very glad to hear that you're going to be alright!
You have definitely come out on top on this. Way to go!

Definitely transfer to the libertybit wallet then! Nothing is stopping you there - that is the beauty of Bitcoin

Thank you for this mini-article. I am with you 100% and am quite excited now!

There aren't interest rates, but there are certainly values to local currencies, no?
I'm not getting mad, I am intrigued and very excited about the potential bitcoin has. My biggest concerns are the lack of actual places to spend bitcoin, and then this hoarding.

The problem lies with the "finite" amount of bitcoins, the anonymity of the creator and the fact that these are being hoarded. It is VERY similar to the traits of a pyramid scheme, and just wanted someone to clarify how it isn't.
I have just been doing a lot of reading before deciding to invest, and wondered if someone who has read this article can explain otherwise.
