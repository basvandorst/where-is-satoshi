Me too.  But instead of backing up my wallet, I backed up my receive address.  I fucking hate my life.

CoinEx does it too.  Not saying they are any better, just thought it was worth a mention.

It really needs to be.  SMTP is by default plain-text.  There is SMTP over SSL on port 465 but that is only really for client-to-server transactions.  Server-to-server still goes unencrypted over 25.

Nothing screams cute like 30 auto-loading death metal music videos and animated gif divider lines.

I bought a new rug recently from Overstock.com.  Unfortunately, it was right after the crash and I was not about to use my precious BTC at that point in time.

uBTC @ 400? By that point, BTC would have been to the moon and back.

If you let the energy in your own body flow, the [electricity] will follow it. You must create a pathway from your fingertips up your arm to the shoulder, then down into the stomach. The stomach is the source of energy in your body; it is called the sea of chi. From your stomach you direct it up again and out the other arm. The stomach detour is critical; you must not let the [electricity] pass through your heart, or the damage could be deadly.

Which surprises me, because there are 8-bits to a byte, as well, and that jingle most likely very much pre-dates computing.  So is this a reference to binary math, and was binary math really a "thing" that long ago, or did early computer scientists decide to call it a bit because it was 1/8 of a dollar?

He never said what illegals he may have bought.  There's more than just drugs out there...

The same can be said for drugs, but the difference is that it is well known that bitcoin can be used to fund that.

It means I done goofed.  I copied it from somewhere and RES must've inserted it, or it was a footnote from instructions
Edit: Yep, that's exactly what it is, RES puts a little ^[1] next to the username to mess me up when I copy it.  Originally I had tipped below the minimum and needed to up it.

It is now, and has always been, *hunter2*

Doesn't bitcointip operate off the blockchain?  Should that not be a problem?

You ask an average joe on the street about Ed Snowden and they'll either not recognize the name or claim he's a traitor or a kook.

TIL that you can tip people in beer denominations...and this is what got me to finally sign up for bitcointip.

I've had a checking account since I was 16, and have a mortgage now which I pay online -- but when I was in apartments I always paid my rent with money orders.  It was just easier to collect the shares from my roommates and get an MO than it was to deposit it into my bank and write a check.  Especially when I had Ally, and cash deposits were near impossible.

You protest "secret courts" in America, the media will label you a conspiracy nut and the majority of the people will treat you accordingly.  It's a said state of affairs.
