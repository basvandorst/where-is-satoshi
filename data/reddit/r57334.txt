If someone walked into a casino and played blackjack every day since 2011 and made millions while doing it, i would think Damn they are good.  
You make it sound like I got all my bitcoins at once, just found em.  And then I forgot about em, and then suddenly remembered I had found them.
Keep explaining away the success of other people with luck, lol.  You should get a rabbit foot and maybe your luck will change.

Ok, to follow your analogy, I am saying if you could call Microsoft as being over valued in the tech bubble, and you shorted Microsoft during the height of the bubble all the way down to the bottom, you would be a newly minted millionaire right?  
If kurgman or anyone thinks btc is in overvalued like Microsoft at the height of the bubble, or tulips at the height of the bubble, one could make a ton of money shorting it on the way down if they are right. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:32:18


If you are so smart, fill us in then.  Or do you think you can win an argument by lording over people as a genius yourself?  Krugmans predictions suck and are wrong.  Lets stay on topic instead of getting side tracked insulting each others intelligence.  


Everything is a bubble.  Given a long enough time scale, the value of every security and national currency will go to 0 .  Paul is suppose to call the market, understand the market activity and patterns and timing of the events.  He failed at that. He made the wrong call.  Thats why he writes "the conscious of a liberal" instead of making his money trading.  


have you actually read his articles?  This is not what they are about.  He may have called bitcoin a bubble in the article, but his ignorant criticism of bitcoin run much deeper than that.  


Luck, lol.  I actually saw market conditions that I thought would make the value of the bitcoin go up.  I didn't just buy it randomly to gamble.  I also mined bitcoins.  Was it lucky that when I read about bitcoin I chose to get involved instead of shitting on it and people who were supporting it?  It was luck I jumped through hoops to wire money to mtgox in japan to buy?  Investing in bitcoin, and chosing every day to hold or sell and making money is far from just "luck".


HAHA, from a bitter no coiner, that is rich!  I dont know what you expect me to say to this.  Too bad I'm not brilliant like you and krugman?  Do you feel smart having made no money in bitcoin and having no skin in the game?  And in Kurgmans case bitter he was proven to be a fool again with his horrible predictions and repeatedly flawed economic critiques.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:22:57
I still feel there are buying oppertunities for the public.  I was talking about bitcoin skeptics like krugman.  If he KNOWs there is no more money to be made in btc, why would he not short it.  
Would you short the tulip bubble if you could?  Of course!  Im saying that krugman not putting his money where is mouth is indicates how strongly he holds bitcoin bubble opinions, but doesnt trust his own advice enough to trade on it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:16:40


So your opinion is a statment of fact now?


Krugman said it was over valued at $10.  The market determined that was a lie.  


What is it like to have such delusions of grandeur.  Im the one who made millions in the market, scoreboard dude.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:26:46
Im talking about retrospect.  You are saying you wont short because you have no idea what is going to happen, that is smart.  
Paul is saying he knows whats going to happen in this article, btc will crash like tulips.  But for some reason he's not shorting.  If he really believes what he wrote, Thats dumb.

Be careful, you'll get squeezed. If paul was any good trading, he wouldn't have to write stories in the paper.  
People who shorted the first time paul spoke badly about bitcoin in his dipshit column must feel dumb now.  If you took his advice then and shorted, your position would have been liquidated long ago.

If you know the price direction, how do you have any downside shorting?  If the price is going down, why wouldn't people looking to get into bitcoin start by shorting it to increase their position?
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:12:12
If its just a matter of time, then he should keep funds set aside to cover his position then, until he is right.  
If he has no idea when it will fail, then what is he going on about it failing for?  Bitcoin seems to be a huge success from my perspective.
here,  paul says, "Some extremely wealthy libertarians have a lot to answer for if these sorts of ppl lose all due to believing in them"
So now that the bitcoin price is up more than 10 fold since then, the opposite must be true also, right?    
Extremely wealthily libertarians were right, they have alot to celebrate because they made many people rich beyond their wildest dreams.  Paul has alot to answer for now IMO, how could he give people such shit advice and then double down on his wrongness when his original prediction was epicly wrong.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 06:34:45
Im well aware he was awarded the nobel prize.  Does that make is predictions any less wrong?

the feeling is mutual.  


So then you will admit krugman was wrong when he said bitcoin was in a bubble at $10.  Clearly the market did not think the asset was over valued at $10.


The are suppose to understand the economy and economic trends right?  Fill us in if you are so smart.  
Economists study the production and distribution of resources, goods, and services by collecting and analyzing data, researching trends, and evaluating economic issues. 
Economists typically do the following:
Research and analyze economic issues
Conduct surveys and collect data
Analyze data using mathematical models and statistical techniques
Prepare reports, tables, and charts that present research results
Interpret and forecast market trends
Advise businesses, governments, and individuals on economic topics
Design policies or make recommendations for solving economic problems
Write articles for publication in academic journals and other media sources
Research and analyze economic issues, lol, krugman sucks at that.  Interpret and forecast market trends, ouch, hard to defend kurgman here.  Advise businesses, governments, and individuals on economic topics, I feel sorry for the people he advised.


You may have understood the words, but you missed the comprehension part

Paul Krugman is stupid.  He thought the internet would be no more influential than the fax machine to the economy.  He thought the stock market would crash when trump was elected.  The first time paul wrote a hit piece on btc the bitcoin price was like $5 each.  Paul just can't admit he is wrong.  I cant believe he can still lecture us about bitcoin being bad with a straight face, thats what he should have titled his garbage.   
But now that there are bitcoin futures, why isn't our boy paul shorting bitcoin?  He should tell his barber to short if he knows the prices is going go down, and he knows its going to crash.   Or is paul krugman smart enough not to take his own advice because he knows he has been blowing hot air and consistently wrong for the last 20 years?
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:46:53


I remember people saying that about going long when btc crossed 1000 for the first time, and then again when it crossed 1000 and stayed there last year.  
Why wouldnt you short?  Is it because you dont trust your own advice enough to put skin in the game?  I actually have skin in the game, and I've made tons of money.  


I love the futures markets.  I make easy money lending my btc, and I have enjoyed watching the shorts get liquidated all the way up. LOL at the people who took kurgmans advice in his last few btc articles.

@_date: 2018-01-30 16:38:41


Winning the award makes him not stupid?  Isn't that pretty much the definition of an appeal to authority logical fallacy? 


Krugman is an economist.  The point of his job is to recognize you can make alot of money trading up on the bubble, like I did.  Instead he shit on an emerging technology because he disagrees politically with the early adopters.  He let his polital bias get in the way of making money.  
He won his prize, “for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity”. How did he do on the analysis of the economy after trump was elected?  How did he do on his initial analysis of bitcoin?  How did mr kurgman do analyzing the effect the internet would have on the economy?  Can you point me to a single economic analysis that kurgman made that is definitively right?  


Ive pulled out more than 10x the money I put into bitcoin, and I still have millions of dollars worth of bitcoin that is all the houses money so to speak.  If krugman was good at "his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity", why am I now rich for doing the exact opposite of what he said when he released his first anti bitcoin piece?  


Also, why wouldnt krugman and his vast economic knowledge and authority then short bitcoin, becuase he knows its going to crash right?  Or is paul krugman smart enough not to take his own advice?  Because he either lost a ton betting against bitcoin, or didn't actually put his money where his mouth is because he didnt even trust his own analysis.  
Thats why he is stupid. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:55:03
The article in the OP compares bitcoin to tulips.  Would you compare Microsoft to tulips?  If you felt strongly the price of Microsoft, or tulips, or bitcoin was going down, why would you not short?  I think microsoft will trend slowly up, so IMO there would be no money to be made heavy shorting it.  
Paul took the time to point out he feels btc is overvalued.  If he feels Microsoft is heavily overvalued I would encourage him to short it too.  For any asset you would compare to tulips because you feel the price is going to fall out.  If you know when it will crumble "soon" as paul thinks, why would you not short it?

Im sure a cash infusion into anyones life would make a big difference, in the short term at least.  I would argue for the vast majority of people, they are where they are as a result of their life choices and habits.  Even if you give them money, they will trend back towards being poor because they lack money management skills.  Like some pro athletes or lottery winners who are filing bankruptcy a few years after they hit it big.
And I really don't think giving my money away would benefit me in any way at all, I'm sure I would not see a "great improvement".

Hilarious to read Armstrong's criticisms of core devs including, "They prefer ‘perfect’ solutions to ‘good enough’. And if no perfect solution exists they seem ok with inaction, even if that puts bitcoin at risk."
Coinbase clearly prefers a  "good enough" approach, even if that puts their customers funds at risk so they can create a bcash pump and dump for their employees.

I have been investing in crypto for the last 5 years.  Every year my wife and I go to Europe.  The tickets are about 5,000 a year for us to go.  So 5 x $5000 = $25,000 total in airfare over the years.  3% of that is $750.   That was enough to buy a couple coins based on the average price between 2012 and now.  I could have bough the tickets with cheap air or Expedia and paid directly in bitcoin, and my net worth would be about $40,000 - $50,000 less than it is now.

What to do depends on how bad you need that $234.  If you need it to run your company or should reinvest it there, cash out your original $234.  While bitcoin may go up and down, I think the general trend will be up so I would just hold it if you can.

If I spend bitcoin then bitpay would know about me right?  And they would be able to cluster my addresses and see everywhere I spent money too, and would be able to know exactly how much bitcoin I have.  My card, or the merchant I am buying from never sees my bank account balance.  
Look, I have no kids.  I run adblocker on my computer.  I use a VPN to browser the net from all over the world.  I run the EFF privacy badger addon.  I don't have a facebook and I am not active on social media.  I switch up reddit accounts ever couple months.  Im sure that they have a profile on me, but I am also sure its much smaller than the profile of other people. 
I have price match guarantee on the card.  If i find a lower price within 90 days of my purchase the will adjust the price down for me.  
And not a personal attack from me either.  I just really think the benefits of the card vastly outweigh the risks. 
I guess I don't expect privacy for international travel or coffee buying

1. Get a credit card that gives you 2% cash back on all purchases.  You will get better purchase protection than with a visa debit card and they give you cash back.  
2. Sign up for Bitpay card, fund bitpay card all at once with one transaction.
3. Pay credit card balance in full each month with ACH transfer from bitpay card.  
Invest your savings / profits for investing in bitcoin or other alts.  Why would you want or need your pizza purchase forever embedded and duplicated in the blockchain of the most powerful computing network?

Why not get the best of both worlds and hold your assets in crypto and spend on your credit card for the cash back. Then every month make one crypto transaction to pay off the bill in full??? Thats what I do and it maximizes the amount of crypto in my wallet and minimized my credit card bill. 
Using my credit card does not take any extra effort.  Clipping coupons takes time and energy.

You are right that its any transaction that can be reported as suspicious.
I wouldn't think a bank would file a suspicious activity report because a client got a transfer from coinbase though.  I would think if anything it would be coinbase filing the suspicious activity report based on where the bitcoins came from.

 &gt;Fine, then every single town that has not had an issue with its tap water I'd like to use as an argument for why these agencies are not useless.
You would have to prove causation, not just correlation.  Was the regulatory body why the town had clean water?  Prove the town would have bad water without the regulators.

You can sue about anything.  Judges throw out frivolous claims, you can still sue about anything.  


Im not sure if you are unable to count to two, or not aware that Erin Brockovich didn't litigate the flint water deal.  


A link from the EPA thinks the EPA is doing good work?  Who would have thought?  Just because they catch people breaking their rules doesn't mean they are doing good work, or that the private sector wouldn't cover the gap in a much more effective manner than the government does.

Same with all cryptos


You just close the channel, you don't have to use an exchange, LMAO you are really ignorant.

To be honest I got you and bitcoin inquisitor, both with the new redditor gray bar, confused and thought you were just one person/poster.

Yeah the preloaded blockchain does save time, but it requires you trust that someone else preloads the correct blockchain.
I fundamentally prefer downloading and verifying my own blockchian. Even if that means I have to pay a few bucks more for something a with a little more processing power than the *edit CASA has.  That being said, casa is an excellent device IMO and I own one also so I wouldn't describe it as "cons" really, just something to be aware of.  You could ask the casa node to verify the blockchain and it would, it would just take a couple weeks.

You honestly think people started using BTC and adopting it because someone gave a bunch of BTC to charities that the charities sold for USD immediately?  I can see that pine reached new audiences in a positive way, but saying that "Pine has probably done more for adoption than anyone else." doesn't seem to be remotely true.  Adoption to me is buying and using BTC like the silk road people were.  Even roger ver probably did more for adoption than pine.  Pine is a feel good story that the media hardly touched at all.  They do a mainstream media CNBC articles about that shitcoin pumper fineman kid every 3 months, pine was a once and done deal that has been forgotten about by most people.

Other than selling the incomplete device, in what way has ledger supported the blue at all?  Actions speak louder than words.  There has been no software update, ever, for the device.  There is no date when we can expect a software update.  How you can defend them is beyond me.  The ledger blue is the worst hardware wallet on the market.

@_date: 2018-03-15 05:07:58


I believe the CBOE futures are cash settled, no need to borrow btc to sell.  


How do you get squeezed if you know the price direction?  Leave some money aside to cover losses for short term fluctuations but if you know the whole trend then just don't put all you eggs in one basket so to speak and you should be theoretically fine.  The only hard part is knowing the price direction.  


No not at all.  I originally replied to a guy who came in here, never being right and not supplying any details, accusing people here of having delusion of grandeur.  I pointed out that people have been (wrongly) rolling out the same criticisms of bitcoin since 2012.


I like your temperature analogy.  Im saying that the temperature trend until june 15th will be warmer.  Some days it may be colder true.  But if I bet every day from now until june 15th that the following day would be warmer, I could make a ton of money overall.  More than enough to cover the few outlier days where we hit cold snaps.    
Again if you know the price of btc is going down, just bet that it goes down a little every day and make money despite fluctuations.  The reason I was replying to the kid originally was this though.  


That was my point to the kid, he doesn't know squat.  I would argue that while traders don't know with 100% certainly whats going to happen with their trades, good traders use the information available to them to bet on things that are more likely to happen, thats how the turn a profit and its what makes them "good" traders. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 03:47:53


If you read the link, you would see its not the exact same thing.  It's a different thing that is named similarly, but not exactly the same. Understanding the details doesn't seem to be your strong point.


You should edit that into the wiki then, because i think that may just be bullshit youre spewing here thats not based in reality.  And you should also work on your spelling.  But here, edit away with your vast knowledge to make the world a better place


lol, oh I'm glad you can read so far into it.  Im sure you're going to read the same stuff on the wiki with your 3rd eye about how its a joke to everyone.  I guess if isn't the place for you, you should stick with your own people in @_date: 2019-01-09 16:44:43

Because our government is dysfunctional and currently shut down.  It's unable to acomplish anything but wasting money and in the grand scheme of things BTC is small.  Plus all the people that have invested and work in the space would be mad, bad optics for the politicians when they would know its not a war they can win, like the drug war take 2.


yeah, agreed, and I did thank you for disproving your own point


Ok well all software and hardware isn't backdoored completely. And even if it was, you think they are going to expose all the 0 days to shut down btc? And you think if attacked the btc community would sit by idly and do nothing?  
Bitcoin is anti-fragile, it will recover from any attack and come back stronger.

Religious beliefs aren't an out to just do what you want.   Rastafarians cant just smoke and give out weed and throw back to religious beliefs when questioned.  If I made a religion up that thought black people were horrible and their skin was the mark of cain from the bible, I couldn't just not allow black people into my store and say its because of religious reasons.  It would be in violation of the civil rights act.
It makes it much simpler if you just allow every business to serve or deny whoever they want.  Then we don't have to go through it on a cake by cake basis and litigate everything. No reason to drag the state in to muddy up the waters with regulations, just let people voluntarily choose to interact or not to interact with eachother.

And still no update on the ledger blue, which was released like a year ago and has never had a single firmware update There have been many promises ever since the blue was release.  But still nothing for software, and not even a new estimated date after ledger blew by the last deadlines and promises made.  
The ledger blue is garbage, not useable and lacks basic features like 25th word passphrase encryption.  For a device that costs as much as the blue did, its unacceptable business practices to leave customers without a working product or even updates on progress.    
And now they have discontinued the Blue too, not much faith that they will ever pull through with the software.  Feels like a long con to me, reminds me of butterfly labs in many ways.  
and anything to add here?  When will the ledger blue get a firmware update? Your silence is deafening.

You likely have no formal education on the subject and trying to explain to someone with a low level of education why Austrian economics is considered a real thing is a waste of time.
And Krugman wasn't the first with the idea, but he endorsed it regardless.  He's an idiot that thinks broken windows stimulate the economy, and he was wrong about bitcoin.

If someone gave you an answer that you didn't agree with, you just classify it as "not well thought through". That makes it subjective.  


See Edward Konklin and Murray Rothbard.  These strong political philosophies have been debated.  


I disagree.  I think either way it makes a strong statement.  The government has limited resources to enforce tax laws.  As you were alluding to in your other post about the "vicious cycle". I see it as a good thing if governments are forced to reduce spending because of decreased revenue.  Its "being the change" I want to see in the world.  When enough people dont respect bad laws, then the people become more free.  Look at gay rights and legal rec and medical weed in the US for example.  The people just started smoking and changed public opinion, and the laws came after that.  People didn't have to publicly announce being a user and face the consequences that come with that, some people chose to remain private about their use.  Although I agree being public about non compliance does raise the stakes so to speak.  


Yeah, I could get caught for under reporting, or I may get away with it.  Just because there is an "upshot" doesn't make it not political activism.

Will you give refunds to the ledger blue buyers ledger inc screwed?  Im well aware I can ask for a refund but asking questions just got me banned in your subreddit before.  Will you reach out to all buyers and offer a refund, or just the people who publicly complain and know they got screwed by you guys. 
But honestly this is how its going to go.  You can either reply to me here and tell me when the next firmware update is and let your buyers know if the ledger blue has been discontinued.  Or, If you don't I will make it well known in ,  and other crypto related subs like about how you treat customers.  How you lie about when firmware will be available and give no update when your deadlines pass.  How you refuse to even reply when your resellers tell the community you have discontinued the blue. And how you ban people who have honest problems and questions about your $300+ flagship device.  Ill even tag you in them and keep asking the same questions so the community can see what an asshole you are being by ignoring the buyers.  It would be a bad look for you and ledger. 
I have already registered and to drive further conversation about your products should you choose not to give a reply about the firmware and status of the ledger blue in general.

I think it says MAY because there is no official word on it yet from the IRS.  The source you cited is just that guys personal opinion.  He does not work for the IRS, he has no authority.
Rod Lundquist, a senior program analyst for the (IRS) Small Business/Self-Employed Division indicated that the IRS would not require Bitcoin to be reported as part of FBAR.
I feel that tax people who are literally selling tax reporting services like yourself are telling people they need to report more than they need to so you can sell the more services and products.  You are not a tax expert, thats why you have to say "Important Disclaimers: This is NOT tax advice and should NOT be relied upon for making any tax decisions".  But you will sell people a tax service.  Its not hard to figure out.

Im sorry it makes you upset, but agorism is a thing.
Rather than slowly amass votes until some critical mass would allow state retreat (if the new statists did not change sides to protect their new vested interests), one could commit civil disobedience profitably, dodging taxes and regulations, having lower costs and (potentially) greater efficiency than one's statist competitors – if any[4]
Agorism believes gradual withdrawal of state support through what Konkin described as "Profitable Civil Disobedience".[4] Starving the state of its revenue and purpose by transferring these responsibilities over to decentralized institutions is the most feasible way to achieve free markets according to agorism.

Theres more to nocoiners that just someone without coins.  Its true that nocoiners don't have any coins or skin in the game, but like the fellow I was replying to originally, nocoiners tend to be particularly bitter about bitcoins success and make bold baseless predictions.  


Serious question, explain to me a scenario where you KNOW bitcoin is going to go down and you lose money shorting it.  If you have no idea on the timing, then you don't really know bitcoin is going to go down.  If you know its going to go down, the price level will only effect how profitable the trade will be for you.

Surly if they do not have appropriate responses for a lot of important questions you could outline your problems with their responses to these important questions.  It seems like you are dismissing the whole theory based on your own subjective standards without even replying to the underlying theory at all.  I would guess this is because you love the state, I bet you subscribe to some flavor of socialism and thats why you don't like it.  


Like when?  When the IRS goes after taxpayers it looks bad on them.  The people hate the tax collectors, that goes back to biblical times.  Lets make tax collectors tarred and feathered again.  
Seriously though, look what happened when lois lerner went after anti tax organizations.  IRS budget was reduced by millions.  IRS now has to implement the new tax law too, good luck doing that and investigating tax evaders at the same time.  


Its not a choice between the people at the gay pride parade and the people who are just being gay living their life regardless of the sodomy laws in their jurisdiction.  I don't think a bunch of homos dressed up like the rocky horror picture show does much for their cause really.  Just knowing average gay people going about their life makes me support gay rights way more than some dude in leather chaps parading down the street in sanfran.  It takes voters and public opinion to get laws changed, you cant do it with parades and letters to your senator.  
But according to your logic the gays should have just complied with the laws and not done gay stuff till they got the laws changed.  Or they could leave the US if they don't like it, right?  


campaigning is working in an organized and active way toward a particular goal, typically a political or social one.  Agorist are working in an organized and active way to avoid complying with government regulation and building the greymaket outside of the government control.  It fits the definition,.


Refusing to comply does lots.  The power of the government is derived from the consent of the governed.  Higher taxes on people who comply will persuade them to see things my way, I hope the government does try to increase penalties and taxes and see how the people react to that.

Right, he said, "The Blue will be produced to another batch of 20k units but will be reserved to our direct sales channels (resellers won't be able to resell them)."
So after that batch there will be no more of them.  Judging by how little support the ledger blue had while in production, I can only imagine how little ledger will support the device when they have sold the last 20,000 in production.

You see how your circular logic is circular.  You cant cite the point you are trying to prove as proof of your point.  I disagree, Jean-Claude Juncker is not decentralized.  


LOL, and russia too right?  They are out because London took the power back.  Take your head out of the sand!


I said they are similar, that is not factually incorrect.  I have already agreed that Brussels has less power than Washington so I don't see what your point is at all.  


I trust in data too.  And the data says in my country globalism is an outflow of wealth for the average man.  The rich outsource the labor to the 3rd world putting downward pressure on wages at home.  Rich get even richer and the people in the middle get squeezed.  Globalism is great if you are in a shithole country and some billionaire is going to build a plant there and now you can stitch nikes and your town gets running water and a flush toilet.  
Globalism doesn't work for me, the data shows it.  The voters know it, and they responded accordingly in the US and in Poland and in Italy and when they did their Brexit too.  AFD is surging in Germany, Merkel has her hands full with Horst.  


Point to whatever polls you like, Ill point back to the only pole that counts, the one at the polling places where the voters elect right leaning populist government after right leaning populist government around the world.  


I dont think you understand zero sum.  Technology makes for a bigger pie to split up.  How big a slice everyone gets is still very much zero sum.

All teens are under 18, they made no choice to end up that way.  All people aren't intoxicated or addicted.  They had to make a choice and seek out drugs to end up that way.  


I wouldn't take positive action to end someone else's life personally.  There is a big difference to me between letting someone make a choice to do drugs and helping them kill themselves.  I wouldn't help anyone score drugs either, if they want to do it fine thats there prerogative but its not my place to help or stop them.


So what you're saying is that they would need an accomplice, because no one on local bitcoins will sell without ID anymore.  Not sure when the last time you were on there.  It would save time and energy to just have the accomplice score the drugs for you in the first place, why bother with the bitcoin at all?


You literally just defined "mental problems" as anything you find undesirable in society.  I think fat people have "mental problems" because they are killing themselves with food.  Should fat people be banned from owning guns then?


Its always a choice.  If its not a choice then you're saying the people are forced to take drugs?  Who is forcing them?  Its like if i murder someone, thats a choice.  That choice will send me to jail.  20 years from now when i wake up in jail, its still a choice i made that put me there.  Even if I dont have a choice to leave jail at that time.  Im there because of choices I made in the past.
You seem to be one of the people who enables addicts.  Ive done drugs myself.  Ive known people hooked to all kind of drugs, opiates, speed, coke, benzos, and of course alcohol.

There is consent in the case of the adult.  Just because you don't like their decision you deem them mentally ill.  Its not a chicken and egg situation here.  They make the bad choice, and that makes them addicted.  The became addicted (ill) as the results of their own bad choices (taking addictive drugs) You seem to think they start as ill, even though someone has to seek out and take drugs to get addicted.

You do realize this is anecdotal, right.  Why did the Dr give them a script?  Were they hurt?  What was the Dr suppose to tell them to do, take Advil?  And if the Dr did do that, the person in pain wouldn't have just sought out another Dr right?
Im gonna trust the people who went to medschool more than the addicts or the family of addicts who are sad about losing a loved one.

Thats not true at all, there woudnt be rampant war without the EU.  For one, the EU has virtually no military force to enforce anything.  The protection and peace in Europe is because of NATO, which was started after a couple of those wars you were alluding too.

It is not, you are moving the goal posts.  If they are interchangeable why did the EEC become the EU?  Clearly they are not the same.  Seems like the EEC wanted to centralize their power to me, by creating a single currency that they used to increase their influence in the region.


Maybe not Trump, but certainly people in his cabinet are afraid of that.
Who in his cabinet are afraid of that?  What I read says the US has the upper hand in the trade deals.  I like Trump strong arming europe on trade deals.  If he puts taxes on german cars, lol, germany is fucked.


Name something that big controlled in a decentralized manner.  Governments have centralized power with the leader at the top.  This is basic and makes perfect sense.  


Berlin, Paris and Rome are more powerful than Brussels. That is provable by how many decisions (that were applied) are born within those cities and how many were born in Brussels.
Did London have more power than Brussels?  Why did they have to leave then?  You keep saying Brussels lacks power, but thats just not true.  Brussels is in charge, they are at the top.  The rules of the EU trump the rules of the individual countries.  Thats why the UK left.
Rome seems to have a problem with the number of migrants washing up on their shores.  How is Brussels helping there?  Seems like the people elected an anti EU government because Brussels was fucking them and they couldn't do anything about it.


Exactly, thats why they are (and are positioning to) get rid of Brussels by leaving the EU


Washington and Brussels are very similar.  Most decisions that affect me are made at the state level of government.  


Globalism doesn't work, full stop.  It requires a central global power, otherwise what binds people to the agreements the globalist make?  If its decentralized, then everyone is doing their own thing in their own nation.  No globalism needed.  


I own a condo in Spain.  I spend 2-3 months a year living in Europe.  I know about who has been elected in Austria and Poland and Italy.  Are those pro EU parties to you?


Very deficient still, but ages ahead of the federal System of US or of course member states have loose collaboration which can often turn into a zero sum game.
I agree that the EU is less centralized than the US federal government.  That doesn't make it desired or decentralized in any matter.  The EU is un needed bureaucracy.
And almost everything is zero sum.  Thats why I want my reps advocating for my and my countries national interest.  Globalist are out there pushing an agenda that doesn't look out for me, where Im a loser in the zero sum game.

Its a complete strawman to say I'm "arguing for economic collapse" when I say democrats spend money like wild and the debt doubled when Obama was in office.

LMAO at you saying "I try and keep an open mind....For the most part though it's a very backwards party." and then calling me a "partisan warrior".  
Obamacare sucks, Fast and Furious gun scandal sucked, obamas support and continuation of war around the world sucked, Obama sucked for acting unilaterally on DAPA, DACA, and men in dresses using the lady's room.  Obama also sucked on the economy.
I do benefit from republican polices.  I don't know what you consider "extreme wealth", but I do know Trumps tax cuts are going to save me big bucks this year.  I also know I have my own retirement and my own healthcare figured out and I have no interest in subsidizing it for other idiots.  
If you are a worthless piece of shit, i can understand being a democrat because you benefit from their polices.  If you're working I have no idea why you're voting against yourself.  The handouts from the democrats are a big inflationary Catalyst and I'm personally not going to get a damn thing from them.  I would much rather see that money spent on myself than see it go to schools or Healthcare or pretty much anything that I would be forced to subsidize for my neighbors.

Yes, if you are comparing the 100% consensual act of buying and taking drugs to a non 100% consensual act, it matters.  It makes the comparison false.  Part of being a child is that you aren't able to do complex things and plan and make good choices for yourself, thats why they have a legal guardian.  


What you are saying about "not a choice" here makes absolutely no sense.  It does work that way, there is always a choice.  The path to sobriety may be hard, but the choice to go down that road and stop using drugs is always there for every addict.  Otherwise explain to me how people get off heroin, if heroin users can't choose to quit?  
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:48:48


Children 100% have legal guardians until 18 in the civilized world.  Comparing people who are addicted to drugs to children is a false comparison, thats my point.  Some people become addicted to drugs because they are selfish and have poor impulse control.  Some people have a network of support and privilege and still choose to do drugs.  
My point is that ordering drugs online requires complex things for your average idiot.  Bitcoin is complex to the average idiot. Tor is complex to the average idiot.  Not getting scammed on the deepweb is complex for the average idiot.  And the whole thing requires planning.  In your hypothetical case of the average depressed idiot, the only thing they are unable to do is make good choices.  


Is it that the people themselves are different, or that they are just making different choices?  Many people who are "weak" for years become clean when they choose to become "strong" and quit the habit through rehab or whatever way they choose to address their problem

It has far more to do with your argument that pedophilia does with mine


Drug addicts CAN make good decisions, most addicts just choose not to.  And what if taking drugs is the decision they want to make?  What's it to you?  Who are you to tell them what to do?  If they want to take drugs, we should let them.  


How does a 13 year old buy bitcoins?  At 13 you can circumvent AML and KYC laws?  If so, you should hang out in with other certified geniuses like yourself.  


you are just taking any undesirable thing in society and blaming it on "mental problems".  Since anyone can go mental at any time, do you think we should empower the state to control everyone?  In the case of guns do you think guns then should be eliminated from society, we can trust the benevolent gov't to protect us?


In the context you are using "strong" its just doing what you want them to do, which in this case is quit drugs.  People quit drugs when its right for them, its a personal choice.  Just like its a personal choice to take drugs in the first place.

You talked about how the EU ended the wars in Europe. EU was founded in 1993, Nato was founded in 1949.  What wars were there in europe between 1949 and 1993?  The EU has done nothing to end war, it appears to me the peace was brought about by NATO.


President Trump wants Europe to pay their fair share.  He wants them to spend more on defense.  Why would he fear Europe defending themselves and paying for it themselves?  Its his goal.  I personally would love to see the US pull out of NATO and stop funding it completely.  


Like how all the polls said hillary would win.  And how all the polls said Brexit wouldn't happen.  Its almost as if the media trots out liberal polls and trys to make it seem as if the people support the globalists to push their own agenda.  Despite this, the people see through the bullshit and elect good non globalist candidates.  


UK polled to remain, remember the odds for betting on the outcome of the referendum?  
And UK could pull out of NATO and no one would care.  Its the USA that provides the bulk of funding to NATO.


In fact the only way for globalism to work in a stable manner is if it works in a decentralized manner.
Globalism by its nature cant be decentralized.  Centralization of world power, currency, and a very strong centralized government are needed to make it work.  You cant have decentralized government, the EU crumbling and the election of populist governments through Europe is the proof.

"The opposition media — the running dogs of the global corporate elite called Trump and Bannon white supremacists," he said to jeers from the crowd.
"But President Trumps economic nationalism does not care about your race, your religion, your ethnicity. ... It cares about one thing: Are you a citizen of the United States of America?"
Of central banks, Bannon said, "They've made you debt slaves, hamsters on the wheel."

What makes someone "good" in your eyes?  Thats so subjective it means nothing.  For me its "good" if bitcoin doesn't face political headwinds.
And everyone in the public light is looking out only for themselves.

I think you should relax with the trump derangement syndrome.  Why don't you like him, just general trump butthurt or does it run deeper?  You said,


Why is he so bad for bitcoin, go on, elaborate your point.
And FYI when you label someone with the blanket accusation of "trash person" without any detail, the burden of proof would be on you to explain why they are trash.  There is nothing for me to "defend" against from you except ad hominem.
Im very invested in bitcoin and have been for a long time. I dont have much stock or faith in politics in general.  But when a pro bitcoin politician comes along like mick or jared polis why sling shit at them?
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:09:15


How many of my yes or no questions have you ignored so far?  Still trying to find whataboutism in my posts? lmao.Ill reply to your questions in good faith that you are still working on the replies to my questions.
You posted in a thread about mick, its implied that your post had to do with the article and the subject of that article.  So yes, you were talking about mick because this thread is about mick and we were all talking about him and how hes fond of bitcoin.  I think what you are really asking is, did you call out mick by name, no you did not.


If you weren't talking about mick, you should be apologizing for off topic shitposting in this thread.  Reading comprehension and context clues leads me to believe you were posting about mick without saying his name though.


Why would you remind people to do their research on mick?   What motivated you to post that now?  What motivated you to talk about people like roger and jihan in the same thread?  I did some research and I couldn't find anything out of the normal for politicans.  Am I missing something?  Why not tell me what you think of mick based on your own research instead of being child like and calling me child like as an ad hominem deflection of my question?


Yeah by saying that mick and jared polis are good for bitcoin I'm driving a left vs right mentality.   Any good left vs right mentality praises both democrats and republicans, youre really smart and on to something here.  
Ive said that I'm going to hear out and probably support any politician who supports bitcoin, democrat or republican or third party, unless someone can give me a good reason not to support them.   Im genuinely asking if there is a good reason not to support mick and you just keep pussyfooting around why you posted and how what you posted links up with the OP.  When I ask directly you got angry and called me a child, you seem super defensive about talking about it.
We do have tons of "left vs right" mentality in this country.  It's why I assumed you were filled with nevertrump rage.  And to be honest, unless you articulate why you would post about not supporting people who support bitcoin im going to assume you are one of these hyper partisan people.   That or a nocoiner who doesnt care about bitcoin.  Because I've seen governments ban bitcoin and while all politicians are shitty, ill take a shit pro bitcoin politician over an anti bitcoin shit politician any day.

nah, you just making yourself look like CSW, all talk no signatures
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:49:56


You posted that in a thread that is literally about Mick.  You are stupid if you think that we didnt think you were talking about mick.   Why pussyfoot around what you are trying to say?   If you have something to say, try to have a spine and say it.  What made you make that post in this thread?  Could it be because you are talking about the individual the article is praising.  And you say I'm a child-like person, lol, someone should look in the mirror long and hard.


And what would we find doing research on Mick that would be a reason not to praise him? Can you point me to where you went over this?  Did you post the same thing when jared polis started taking bitcoin or does he pass your character test because of his political alignment?


Ok then get to apologizing if you're a real man, lmao.  


Nice ad hominem, you wont discuss politics because you are getting crucified here.   You cant keep up, you have nothing to add when Im literally begging you to defend and elaborate on  your vague bullshit.


I don't think you understand what whataboutism either, you are just using the buzzwords of the left now.   Can you point me to where I used whataboutism?

True, some politicians are owned by other special interest groups.  No politicians serve the people, they all are power hungry, some are better at creating the illusion they are serving the people, but none of them actually do serve the people.


Agreed. Id rather see most of them assassinated that re elected.

You're talking about mick here right?  Cause the guy you were replying to was showing stuff mick did that was kinda cool. And the guy you replied too seemed to think you were talking about mick in your OP too, FYI.
So you are saying that you don't 100% disagree with mick.....  Well yeah, no one is exactly the same.   Newsflash, you're never going to 100% agree or 100% disagree with anyone.  It seems like you have unrealistic expectations for your politicians if you want them to just represent your own view 100% of the time.
Im against wright too, because he's a fraud.  If someone posted a "good" thing craig did,I would point people to read the andrew O'Hagan article here, 
That gives them good hard info to see why craig is bad for bitcoin.  Its not just a pointless insinuation that ultimately makes me look spinless and weak, unable to defend my position about craig. Its hard data that any idiot could read and arrive at the same conclusion.

you can you do you are own research too
It almost seems like we cant agree on escrow, like I said.
You don't have substantial coins, its why you don't care if politicians are pro btc and why you want to deflect and banter endlessly about bets instead of providing signatures.   You remind me of CSW in this regard.
And like CSW, you have no signatures, just excuses and banter.

You repeatedly ignore questions as to why Mick is bad for bitcoin, lol.  You repeatedly ignore questions as to why mick is a garbage person in your mind.  Im not going out on a limb here to assume trump derangement syndrome.   You have literally nothing to back up your statements and wont back them up or elaborate when asked. Seriously, if you arent mad at him as a part of partisan trump derangement syndrome, why should we be extra mad at mick?  How is he worse than your typical politician?
You don't reply to the questions because you don't want to defend your own views, just sling crap.  
If we have someone in the pubic eye who supports bitcoin, we should definitely tolerate them and possibly praise them unless there is good reason not to.  You have given us no reason not to like him.  You literaly said he's 


and shy away from backing up your own empty words. 
Thats whats bigly saddest.

This thread is about mick being pro bitcoin, and you said lets not praise garbage people who are pro bitcoin.  Either you are posting about mick or your post is off topic for the thread.
To be clear, do you think mick is garbage person?
Do you think, mick is 


Or did you just post it because you like to see your name on the screen when you post?

Asking someone a genuine question is not whataboutism.   You cant be serious.


Read it again, I said you didn't say his name.  Everyone in the thread is talking about mick, were you or are you off topic?


lol what you got is your foot in your mouth and your tail between your legs because, lol


You want to make this left vs right, thats why you said I was being left vs right, when in reality i was being pro bitcoin and pro politicians who are cool with bitcoin.  Thats why I praised both republican mick and democrat polis.  You seem to be the one who cant speak a word about politics without being hyper partisan.


lmao, so instead of defending any of your real points you would rather argue about who laid first claim to calling the other childish.    The irony so so rich here.  Please refrain from telling others to please refrain from making various posts in an open internet forum. 


I'm still waiting for my apology from you. :)
Im still waiting for you to reply to my questions, but all you have is more waffling and pussyfooting around, who would have guessed.

But ok, so now it was about mick?  Gee who would have thought.
Seriously though, why do you think hes garbage?  Which policy he supports do you want to change most?  Or are you calling him garbage based on general partisan left vs right reasons?

lmao is right! All politicians are trash and we are stuck with them, you are just too dumb to realize we might as well be stuck with trash politicians that are pro bitcoin.
Last year NBA finals, who is the hero and who is the villain, steph or lebron?  Probably depends on your perspective.  LMAO that you don't see that perspective is why you think the villain is the villain and the hero is hero.
