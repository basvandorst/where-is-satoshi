And then there are those of us who are interested in getting started but aren't college students. :(

Now that's just encouraging him. If someone is beyond reasoning with, then simply ignore them. You're only elevating the situation with your mocking.

With this to top it off he has now received more bitcoin in this thread than above who actually answered a question. I'll never understand the inner-workings of all this.

When will it end?!

One might even say that it escalated all the way to the moon in fact!

Unfortunately for both sides, the idea of bitcoin hating dogecoin seems to have become a self-fulfilling stereotype.

I specifically addressed what to do in that case.


The key point being, not to make the situation any worse, which you still haven't addressed.

As you said yourself, it is only 'some' of the fans who act like that. Regardless of any rivalry, it is proper reddiquette to search for a similar post to your own before posting yourself.
Tl;DR vocal minority and all that.

This is an interesting experiment to say the least. 
Edit: Ahh, it was only a matter of time until even this impartial remark got downvoted.
Edit: Aaaand, we're back in the positive!

Thanks again! You're doing a better job than most in representing the bitcoin community.

There there... It'll be ok.

Edit: First time tipping dogecoin on = First time getting downvoted on I guess I should've known better.

Thank you! You're the only one here who actually answered the rest of the questions rather than focus on the hate part. I'd tip you but I only have dogecoin and that doesn't look like the best idea around here.
