Based on purchases. I guess what I'm discovering from talking to people about this is that I value entry points a little more than most. I'm not saying that's a good or bad thing.

Trainwreck! Sell-off is scaring some of the recent investors. Should see support not much lower than this

Absolutely! You bet your ass I would have. Hindsight is 20/20, I bet you would have as well. When you are investing in something, you are literally betting that the price will go up, as soon as you buy it. If it goes down instead, you were wrong. And you should leave the investment and walk away because your initial idea and the whole reason you entered your position is incorrect. Staying in an investment that goes against you is wishful thinking and holding on for dear life because you don't want to be wrong. Meanwhile, you could have taken a small loss and put that money into something that's actually working for you. 
To clarify with your Amazon example, if I got in at 100, I would have sold no lower than 90 when it started to drop. Then while everyone was watching it crash to 10 and slowly rise back up to 100, I could be having that  $90 make some money in a better company. You can always get back in

Lol I'm aware, my above statement is what enables them to do that though. If no investors get scared during a sell off and also sell, those guys wouldn't make shit.

That's assuming it's not a bubble, that it won't ever be banned in the USA, that wall street won't find it overvalued and slam it back to the earth, that it holds future value, AND that it will actually be applied as a currency one day. Yes you are right, so far every correction has been sent soaring back up into the sky, but a popped bubble starts as a simple correction. I'm very optimistic with bitcoin. But I won't be the one sitting here with nothing when/if it implodes. 
Edit: these are basic investment tactics. Cutting your losses is an integral part of being a successful investor. Bitcoin is no different. It is highly speculative and LESS protected from failure than most common stocks.

Bad idea in my opinion. With something as volatile as this, and dangerous as a bubble, you need to cut your losses. I believe in bitcoin and I believe it will make it to 40k this year, but if I'm ever down 10% in it overall for some reason, you bet your ass I'll be taking my money and running. Never accept a loss bigger than 10% just because you don't want to be wrong

Dude you doubled your investment. Take half your earnings, and then completely ignore the other half for a few years if that's the strategy you want to take. That way at this point no matter what happens you come out even. And if you make 1000% on half of your principle, you'll still be fuckin rich and happy. Risk management!

Lol I guess we do, but thanks for acknowledging that instead of just getting riled up and yelling. There's something to be learned from both of our methods, and I'm stoked you've done so well, I guess I have a lower risk tolerance and prefer to lock in my gains faster. My methods won't ever get anyone rich overnight, but also won't let someone be broke overnight.

Haha I'm glad someone else ITT has an actual plan instead of blind faith. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:07:15
Couldn't disagree more :)

Sold all at 17.7k thinking it was a mistake. Yesss

Makes sense! To add to that, all of us are taking on risk just by investing. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't minimise that risk by cutting losses.
And lol several countries have already banned bitcoin. And for good reason, it directly pulls money out of the USD and the hands of the wealthy, discourages spending, and decentralizes power. Do you think the 1%, the people who have power and billions in USD's, want that? I highly doubt it will be banned, but there is motive to do so! I'm not trying to "bestow secret wisdom", these are "investment 101" thoughts that people should consider when investing in anything. Especially something as speculative as BTC.

Lol I'm taking about risk management. I'm stoked that you made some incredible investments, and that's awesome that it worked out for you that time, but if you held every single investment that went against you, you wouldn't always be so lucky. If you cut your losses to A certain percentage you are protecting your capital and utilizing it in a more productive way, and making sure that you mathematically will make money in the end. The emotional trader has a hard time beating the market
Also: you put 200k into an OTC stock, made 100%, and have yet to exit your position? Sorry for slow replies, Reddit is limiting my response frequency

Interesting. Thanks. It's also based on coinbase vs bitfinex, maybe there was a difference in trade volume
