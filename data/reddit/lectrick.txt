That "price" is merely on paper until he actually trades them for useless dollars. Yes, "trades", not "sells."
You know, economics?

Taking shares instead of money for building Thredup.com (literally from scratch) and Desk.com makes me an entrepreneur.
What the fuck have you built from scratch, again? Because if the answer is "nothing," then sit the fuck down, armchair plebe. You come at me with an actual site you built, or anything you created, then you earn my respect. Otherwise you're just a consumerist asshole.

60% bonds? Are you for real? Not only are bonds boring as shit, you'll barely beat the fucking inflation rate with that conservative as fuck distribution! I wouldn't even go 60% bonds at *retirement*!
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:27:53
OK then, which 20% did you mean? The 20+% drop in 2011, in 2012, in 2013 or in 2014?
Also, Draper probably lost (*on paper!*) MORE than 20%, as it appears he overpaid (on purpose) for all the silk road bitcoins, having outbid everyone else.
Bias: I have mined 3,500 BTC and sold about half of them between January and March of this year, finally making me an entrepreneur (I've worked for startups as a programmer for years).

Do you mean that they pay you 1 BTC but when you refund you only give back 0.8 BTC because the price rose and you've been converting into and out of USD? Or something like that? I think most people involved w/bitcoin would understand that sort of thing, although as you said, that's really just using BTC as a payment network and not as a currency

Slippery slope fallacy. No, I'm not saying that. You can be bullish on something without assuming it will just keep rising to infinity. Are you daft?

I added lots of comments to explain the purpose of each option.
Note that it also compresses (via bzip) and adds brute force resistance (via a large number of rounds). Only works on 1 file at a time, though (not directories... yet).
If someone could add any features or make it work on Windows, would be cool (although you'd still be susceptible to keyloggers). OS X Terminal does have some sort of secure text entry facility, though, I believe.

No. An entrepreneur is anyone who gets paid to do work using a financial instrument that is not cash, dumbass.
How many startups have you worked for, again?
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:15:46
The thing is, it's a currency tied to an Internet meme, and, I guess let's put it this way: Would you invest in Allyourbasecoin?
@_date: 2014-03-14 03:45:37
I don't see why naked shorting is a problem.
I agree to sell you 10 bitcoins at $650 each. I don't actually have the bitcoins yet, but I take your $6500. I wait 2 days and stall. The btc price drops to $600. I buy 10BTC for $6000, complete my end of the original deal, and pocket the difference of $500.

Stay away from Warren Buffett. He made his money in an outdated economy.
@_date: 2014-09-13 06:19:29
Fair enough. But intelligence-driven investment would have exceeded that by a long shot
@_date: 2014-09-13 06:26:18
You can't even fucking spell, therefore I can't help but presume you're an idiot

Keep your day job working for The Man. You wouldn't have the brass balls to be an investor.

Part of the point of Bitcoin is to enable easy international trade, and here we are single-point-of-failure'ing our way through Coinbase which is US-only.
@_date: 2014-09-13 06:23:38
The founders get issued shares. That makes them "paid" too.
Methinks you don't understand what money actually is.
@_date: 2014-09-13 00:32:14
I've worked at startups and gotten paid in shares which are worth (if they go public) at least $250k.
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:09:43
Blockchain.info will also notify you on "watch only" addresses.
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:20:13
ah, interesting.
@_date: 2014-02-05 14:34:11
And given that it doesn't offer much of a difference (feature-wise) from other cryptos (which I would call its "intrinsic value"), and that it's largely benefited the preminers and the early doge adopters at this point... *How* does this not differ from a pump and dump, again?
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:41:51
Don't you mean inversely proportional to the derivative? :)
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:53:40
How do you think it looks now? :O

The word "Usury" is usually used to describe *excessive* or "unfair" interest.
If you invest in LendingClub for example, I think it's totally fine.
There is this idea that you are taking candy from babies (read: taking advantage of people with poor impulse control), however.

I was poking. I actually agree with you, and you are correct. Easy on the downvoting there, trigger-happy

They don't allow storage of coins on the phone, probably for security reasons.
But the Blockchain.info app has always allowed you to send/receive (by being basically a web frontend wrapper and QR code scanner via the hardware) and I would really like to know who spread this bullshit misinformation that iOS doesn't have a wallet app
@_date: 2013-08-11 00:05:46
It's just Coinbase integration, right?

Medical coverage? Paying for infrastructure?
We're moving to an idea economy but we're a long way from being able to shrug off the physical needs.

Any change of opinion now? :O

I know what you're getting at, but all assets are valuated like this. It's not like everyone trying to sell Facebook stock at the current price wouldn't crash it, either.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:09:12
Well, if you believe in the idea, then it basically has to go up, in order to soak up the value it will be doing the exchanging of.
If you don't believe in the idea or think it will fail, then maybe buy a few for the heck of it and just watch.

You make some tired points, but there are some facts at play. Note that speaking in generalizations DOES disenfranchise the "exceptions to the rule", as it were, so you have to be careful:
Note: only discussing heterosexuals here. Othersexuals can be very different than the below and generally confuse everyone (ideally pleasantly) :)
1) Men have bigger muscles (fight/defend). So they tend to create/destroy/protect. They are the world remakers. More left-brain. Risk-taking. Generally.
2) Women have boobs (nurture). They are more empathic and act on a deeper level than the logical (possibly due to having a larger corpus callosum). Possibly more right-brained. Tend to be risk-avoidant.
3) Men produce billions of sperm in a lifetime. 
4) Women produce only a few hundred eggs and have a limited fertility window.
To assume that there are *no* consequences to the above 4 bio facts is quite naïve at best.
Anyway, Bitcoin seems to hit all the typical hetero male buttons- Risk, technology (read: control and power), and money (read: power). Not to mention anonymity (read: defense/power) and cryptographically secure and decentralized (read: personal power, independence, not kowtowing to The Man)
[Here is a study showing that male and female monkeys prefer the same toy types that human counterparts do]( So you can't just attribute all the differences to socialization.
The sexes complement each other nicely, but they are very different generally.
And Bitcoin needs more women!

There are the so called "black swan events"
