Coinbase appeals to mainstream users. I'd wager that very few of their customers go through with verifying their accounts and going through GDAX to withdraw their funds.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:14:31
They absolutely do profit from transaction fees, otherwise the transaction fee for withdrawals would be equal to the withdrawal fee that they charge. For my last withdrawal, the withdrawal fee was 25 CAD and the transaction fee was about 19. Unless they're using the other 6 for other expenses like consolidating their inputs (for which charging the customer would be inappropriate), they are probably pocketing the difference.

Obviously not, but there remains a community with the sense not to accepted tainted BTC for fear of being targeted by victims of a hack or the government. The NEM team definitely overreached by taking the matter into their own hands, but it's important to realized that the same thing can, has, and will happen with Bitcoin. In the latter case, it's the community that takes the NEM team's role.

Claim your altcoins in order of decreasing importance (whatever that means for you) so that accidentally revealing your private key won't do as much harm. I'd move all of your BTC to the Trezor before proceeding.
Past that, claiming the money is as simple as importing your private key into a TRUSTED wallet for the respective coin and sending it to an exchange; here's a guide for Bitcoin Cash:

The reason probably lies somewhere between complications with floating point numbers and significant digits. Keep in mind that denominations of BTC aren't infinite.

No, there are many people - even commoners - who are still holding their &lt;$200 coins (early 2013) and some holding their &lt;$1000 coins (mid 2014). Bitcoin serves the purpose of being a store of value and that's what people are using it for.

Buying BTC with USDT without having an existing balance requires you to purchase the USDT from Tether's site. Not confident that any fees are involved in the process so that'll be ignored. The wire transfer can take a few days. You'd then need to deposit that to Bittrex and purchase BTC, losing some value to deposit and trading fees. Withdrawing your BTC will further reduce your balance. 
By the time your money is on Coinbase, the rate per BTC may have decreased. To withdraw to your bank account, you'll pay 1.49% + 0.50% for slippage fees. 
You'll likely lose money.
@_date: 2017-09-03 20:42:06
Your mnemonic phrase is used to generate an arbitrary number of addresses on demand. When restoring your seed, the client looks for used addresses until it hits some unused addresses and then it stops. The balance updates whenever this process is finished.
It shouldn't matter how it works, just know that it does and your seed can be used to recover your funds should your KeepKey fail.

Depends on when you're sending your transactions. Transactions with 5-10 sat/B fees are currently being confirmed within a few blocks because the mempool is relatively empty. 
With a decent wallet you should be able to preview the transaction before signing and broadcasting it. Check the actual size of your transaction in bytes and multiply that by 5-10 to determine your transaction fee in satoshis and pay that amount.

Hedging against BTC volatility with USDT works until it doesn't. They can't be redeemed directly for USD and so there's no guarantee that they'll remain pegged to USD. What happens when many traders want to sell for USDT? It won't remain stable at $1.
Things like this are offputting:
Use it if you'd like, but USDT is not what most people believe it to be.

Their Android wallet is probably fine for small amounts. It's never a good idea to hold a lot on a mobile device. Mycelium is one of the more feature rich mobile wallets and the code is on GitHub.

How would the BTC be converted to fiat without the use of payment gateway? If "actual Bitcoin payments" means that the merchant receives BTC to their wallet, then it's already possible but currently infeasible due to block and tx confirmation times.
In the future, with LN, you should be able to periodically load up a payment channel and that'll allow you to spend from your balance quickly and cheaply. I'd imagine that more stores would be willing to take PoS BTC payments that way.

Yes, segwit addresses look just like P2SH addresses (same P2SH encoding, starts with a '3') so you can provide your segwit address when receiving BTC.
Legacy to segwit (P2SH-P2WPKH) and segwit to segwit (P2WPKH) would be discounted, so you can consolidate your normal inputs into a segwit address and pay a cheaper fee. The effective size should be used in fee estimates.

Coinbase has some crappy price estimations that don't vary based on the current mempool status. Wouldn't be surprised if they set a static fee (~$5) regardless of the transaction size. Mycelium is a little better, but they still recommend 49, 159, 318, and 353 sat/B for each fee tier (low, economic, normal, priority, respectively). Currently ~5 sat/B transactions are being confirmed. 
To minimize the fees you pay when spending BTC, you should move your Coinbase funds to a wallet you own in bulk. For example, instead of paying $5 for a $5 transaction, you can pay $5 for a $1000 transaction and then spend many times from your wallet. You should export your private keys or wallet seed from Mycelium and import it into a wallet that allows you to set a custom fee.

Probably not 1TB per year but archive nodes store everything from contracts to transfers. Ethereum includes the current database state in its block headers unlike Bitcoin, so people can run pruned full nodes (which are still fully functional) to cut down on the bloat.

There's no point in storing and maintaining the blockchain data if your offline computer won't connect to the Internet. What you're probably shooting for is an airgapped computer that you sign transactions on and transfer to an online computer to broadcast to the network.

You'll need to consolidate your balances/inputs into a single segwit address. You'd then use it normally, but with new address formats. What wallet are you currently using?
