Yes. Asking questions is a great way to listen and obtain information. I find it extremely useful when I need to cut through people just making noise.


I will ask one more question. Do you know the definition of narcissism? Not every post has to be tailored for Cryptolution to be interesting or appealing. Sometimes narcissistic people forget its not all about them.

@_date: 2017-02-15 05:17:45


Are you talking about the 5 devs working behind a "closed membership model", paid by an actor which main reason for not accepting Segwit is 'I feel core did not listen to me'?

Could you just step out of your short-sighted-make-me-rich-entitlement box and think of the bigger picture just for a second? 
How do you think Bitcoin will get to a mainstream adoption phase (aka moon prices for the impatient Bitcoin redditor)?  Even my nephew (which is 12) understands basic principles of business (if you think of Bitcoin as a product) and technology adoption. 
What do you think it is going to happen when these students, future professionals, business owners and law makers are exposed to cryptycurrencies? Like.. Really? How is it possible that someone thinks this is something bad? I am am dead serious when I say I am shocked. 
Some days I have these romantic ideas about Bitcoin of how elegant the technology is and fascinating the opportunities it brings to the table. Then I think of how smart are early adopters for jumping in this boat. It only takes a comment like yours to destroy the illusion and bring me back to reality. Not everyone is here for the same reasons.

Great job? He continuously gave bitcoin the middle finger for a platform that still has no use cases. I wouldn't be surprised if the dislike the BTC community shows towards coinbase is due to his (and Brian's) poor leadership decisions.

Vitalik did a rollback to bail out his friends who lost money in the DAO fiasco, giving up on censorship resistance. It is quite difficult to run a full node which has lead to centralization, Infura does not offer any benefits when compared to Amazon web services. A couple of month back, a handful of developers decided to change the issuance rate over a couple telephone calls, still they claim they can compete with bitcoin on store of value. The have pivoted on every marketing slogan they have hold, world computer, decentralized Uber, and so far all they have delivered is some collectible kitties on web. Did I mention Vitalik was selling quantum cumputer mining scheme before ethereum? These guys are profesional scammers with a huge marketing team and lots of techno babble in order to obfuscate their crappy tech.

Bitcoin had cancerous cells. It got removed and it was named Bcash. As you would expect with cancerous tumors, it started attacking itself after not so long. It split and spawned a second cancerous faction, so now we have, Bitcoin ABC (BAB), which is Roger's and Wu's social attack to Bitcoin and Bitcoin SV (BSV), which is Craig Wright and some other pedos pet project. Because the bear market is incredibly boring, Bitcoiners are taking bait and giving them tons of undeserved attention and creating noise in the space.

Greg, in a crazy ballpark estimate. How long do you think it would take to get enough knowledge and experience to be able to contribute in the development - testing of the protocol for a novice developer? Is it reasonable to have such dream or is it just for the Bach-like minds of Como Sci.?

This question could be answered via, has this project pivoted from their vision? For example, ETH started as a decentralized world computer that would eventually end issues such as centralization of the internet in AWS. Beautiful slogans were crafted by ConsenSys marketing department. Code is law. I think it first started with the infamous DAO hack. All those beautiful promises ended in a nasty rollback, where Vitalik showed how centralized the decision power is for that project. The hacker funds were "re-distributed". It destroyed the promises of immutability, which imo, it is a key property of Bitcoin. The next pivot went to dAPPS, where things like Uber would become a thing of the past. You could have its decentralized version on ETH and paired with driverless cars? OMG! The sky is the limit. This was also never delivered as we saw last bubble where cryptokitties brought the network to a halt. The ICO usecase is the only real traction the platform has had and yet to show any net benefit for the industry. Now they are moving to DeFi. It sounds super interesting but I am already holding my popcorn for their next fuck up.

The point where you compare bitcoin with another credit card solution reminds me of an interview in the 90's where Bill Gates was trying to explain the potential of the technology behind the internet. The host basically asked him *"So.. many faxes is my company going to save with your futuristic computer network?"*
@_date: 2015-04-15 13:36:52
Are you familiar with inflation and what it does to your 'savings' ? Please tell me where would you recommend me to 'save' my money. Last year, Cyprus government took money directly from their citizens bank accounts to fund a bail out.  
You forget that in many parts of the world, $200 is more than a monthly wage and based in your argument, you are again excluding the third world from participating in what I think it's going to be the most important financial revolution. Nice try Wells Fargo. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:53:51
