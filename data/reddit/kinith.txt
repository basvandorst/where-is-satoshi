When I first read this comment, I immediately got frustrated and closed the tab. Then, the comment stuck with me and annoyed me so much, that I re-opened this comments thread just so I could downvote you and leave this reply about how pretentious your comment was.

Is it just me, or does the B seem off center? Kinda giving me an OCD flare-up.

Spots like this on CNN aren't by their main broadcast crew. They pay a separate company to make the show, or buy it from them. Then there's a string of lawyers that it goes through. Then the show gets shelved for a while, for any number of reasons. At this point the people that made the show have moved on. The people that made the show may not even work for that production company anymore. To make a change like this, first, the executive producers would have to authorize the change(which they probably don't even care or notice), then it would have to go back through the lawyers to approve the change, then it would have to go back to a post production company to make the change, all of which requires paying a few people. Then it has to go back through lawyers to approve that the change was made in the fashion that was originally approved. The whole round trip for this one small change requires a lot of people getting a pay check... and 99.9% of the time, the people in charge don't care enough about the content to pay for that change.
