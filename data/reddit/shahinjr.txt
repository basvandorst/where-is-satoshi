That is how it should be, because of the "Instant Guarantee"... Please get in touch with me ASAP, i have posted on every fb page, forum, blog and emailed and called, not one response, this is insanity.

A payment of price increase is the only remedy I will accept, since I thought it was suppose to be "Instant" as advertised. Instead it's been days with no response from any CS or Agent. Around 1000 dollars, which to me, is a good amount of money. I understand the traffic, but it is your business that you chose. Customers cannot be penalized for this.
