unlikely. Because if the whole point of scamming the seller of BTC is that the scammer can run away with the BTC anonymously (pseudonymous). Whereas running away with Cash would hugely increase the risk for the scammer.

Their official statement for Bich Cash has more inconsistency than the viscosity of greek yoghurt.  
I called them out for it on Linkedin. ( I have quite a large I-banking following) Please like and share if you have a LInkedin account.

I hope you see her being a great mother to your children! If so it's a great trade!
If not.... sorry OP.

I guess so. There is lower hanging fruit though!

The change that will occur is:  
1.) The "CEO" would get instantly denounced by every bitcoiner and their father. 
2.) The "CEO" would get digitally trolled (hacked, ratted,doxed, blackmailed ect...) so hard he will ragequit social media and maybe commit suicide. 
Nothing substantial would change with Bitcoin though.

If only these fines go back into the pockets of those who lost money. Instead it goes towards the treasure where it will be used as collateral to in-debt your children.
