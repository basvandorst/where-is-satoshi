I think the IRS will be like "No FDIC? No funding you see."

what did you see on the other end? Dark rooms? I'm curious.

Hehe, thank's for the laugh. ;D
I take it you didn't see anything then.

Well, nmapping their IP address(es) is legit strategy. I don't doubt your haxor skillz, but the story was rather far fetched.

Should I scared if I tried to register with them in the past? like sending them personal information?

On bitcointalk i'm unable to post to anything but the newbie thread for now, so I cant contact them through the forums. I suppose all that's left is patience.

Thanks for that info. The transaction was only 233 bytes, so I wonder how much an impact that has. 
 I sent an email to them about an hour ago, no replies yet. Since you mentioned IRC, do you think deepbit.net would have an IRC channel somewhere?

I did not request it from my wallet, I clicked "instant payout" on the deepbit.net website. Here's the wallet transaction view:

I just really need a way to get in touch directly with deepbit. 3rd day and they still haven't contacted me back.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:58:52
I'll be able to take a look at that in about an hour from now. I'll update after then.

Well, that's awesome to know so far. The other side of the mystery remains of how nothing sees the transaction taking place. I'll just see how it goes from here.

I didnt have any control over the fees when I instructed deepbit to pay out. I have no idea if it used a fee to make it faster. I think somewhere on the site deepbit said that fees would be included automatically but I have no idea.

Looks like post  is spot on to what i'm having a problem with: (permalink)

Ok so I gave that a look over, and I think that will only work if i'm using bitcoin QT. I have it downloading the block chain on my home server and when its done, I will transfer my wallet from multibit to BTQT if possible.
Edit: oh i almost forgot about the transaction data. Here's a pastebin:

I have no idea if it used a fee when it paid out to me. So I guess that's another variable in this mystery.
