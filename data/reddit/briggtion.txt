Hahah please elaborate

Okay so I built a bomb shelter with an indoor farm and started hoarding resources. What now?

To my knowledge, you also couldn't redeem the USD for gold from fort knox. Backing can mean it supports the infrastructure and protects the currency.
@_date: 2019-11-17 14:24:50
Alright man. My bad about the assumption. You do you

1. People don't go into college with all the money needed for college in a single account, it's often given out as loan with the specification that they will use it for schooling. 
2. No, a diploma by itself doesn't make someone smart. The years of singular driven purpose and ability to overcome something most people can't made them clever. 
3. You're heavily investing in Bitcoin because you want to feel smarter and better than the "master/phd people." I actually have a couple friends going for their phd programs right now, and unless you have some proof otherwise, neither you or I have the mental endurance to survive those programs.

No because when coin base becomes a bank then a new crpyto/coin base will upheave that bank. It's bank topplers all the way down
@_date: 2019-11-04 18:44:39
Right but there exists more USD than there did 100 years ago. Which means more people are using it, which makes the currency stronger as more people are dependent on it.
@_date: 2019-11-04 15:55:52
You're right there isnt an equation that ties military strength linearly with economic power. It's just what the US is excellent at. In the same way that Saudi Arabia has tons of oil, as you mentioned, the Switzerland government has a robust banking system, other governments are going to utilize their position and resources to best benefit their citizens, and their national currency.
Now, because we are free citizens living in an open market, we can trade our own currencies to whichever currency we feel will provide the strongest, or safest return. Imagine the market falls into a depression with losses left and right. If I just wanted to ensure my money stays safe, the US government is offering a guarantee through treasury notes. Now, my money is being guarded by the largest military in the world, as well as being tied to the petrodollar. The US still has the possibility of collapsing, but the possibility that another country declares war, and destroys them is greatly removed.

Nope, I think a multiple choice survey question would be worse. If I were constructing the question, and I wanted to be non-bias, I'd propose the question as, "What external forces do you believe support, or back, the United States Dollar?" This allows for people to reflect on their own opinion without worrying about getting the question right or wrong.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:38:49
Someone couldn't get into college :o
@_date: 2019-11-13 14:41:19
Which is?
@_date: 2019-11-12 22:09:55
Risk. Hype around Bitcoin could end up hurting a lot of people not knowing that it is ultimately an experiment.
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:26:08
Leading question. When making a survey you want to limit the information that you provide to participants as much as possible.
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:27:18
Okay I'm unhappy that the rest of the world isn't living in a bomb shelter what now?

Ya lost me with the 96% loss.
@_date: 2019-10-12 01:47:19
bitcoin* or whatever relevant cryptocurrency Im using
@_date: 2019-10-12 02:25:52
Ohhh, that makes sense. Sorry if I'm asking dumb questions, just popped into my head during work.
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:06:22
I imagine credit would still exist then? The goal would just to be tied to a more secure entity, similar to gold-backed USD?
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:07:40
They did that to fight the atheistic culture that the Soviet Union was emitting.
@_date: 2019-10-12 01:27:42
How would they know how much I have?
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:11:41
Youre literally turning on your own kind here. If you want people to actively use a currency they need to feel confident that the purchasing power will remain relatively same. We often see hyper inflation wreck economies, but hyper deflation is equally problematic. If people are worried the money in their account is going to be worth 10x in a few years, theyre not going to spend it.  You should praise the early adopter, whether or not they sold.

Huh, TIL, "Tesla was founded in July 2003, by engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, under the name Tesla Motors. ... Tesla Motors was joined by Elon Musk, J. B. Straubel and Ian Wright, " [wiki](

Read like a copypasta. 
Also you think sports are for normies and revere the roman culture, 10/10 neet
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:28:19
Can you elaborate on the credit problem? I've heard it mentioned and I don't understand.
@_date: 2019-10-12 02:48:06
I guess that's what I don't understand about it. Like there's always going to have to be intuitions that provide at the very least, a loan.
@_date: 2019-10-12 05:29:51
Youre against credit?
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:25:39
Cool, I appreciate the explanation &lt;3
@_date: 2019-10-13 23:48:21
Why even put an x value of time if youre not going to limit it? This graph could literally represent a trillion years and it would still fall under the x value.
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:58:37
It generally depends on what type of loan youre taking. If you ask for a mortgage loan, they agree, and then you somehow use that money to buy something else, yeah they're going to be upset. 
However, if you take a general loan out, the likelihood of granted funds is more dependent on your credit, and collateral, rather than your attempted purchase. 
Hope this helps

Ethan Hunt, the author of this piece, is the CEO of 7bitcoins. I did a bit of digging and found he had a couple failed books and now he's hitching his wagon to the crypto horse.

So the bank's mentality of "too big to fail" is bad. However, bitcoin's blockchain is immune.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:46:17
Hey, just watched an interesting video and it related to your comment quite well. [Link]( around 5 mins it talks about inflation stagnation
@_date: 2019-09-30 18:04:33


That's not exclusive to bitcoin. Most things follow that model. If I'm going to a restaurant on a friday night, I don't spend the week beforehand learning what makes a good restaurant or not. I'm more likely to look at reviews and ask friends for recommendations.

Inflation is needed for exports. Exports allow for more goods to be produced than a country would need, bringing in more money to the citizens who create goods. The people who make the goods are likely taxpayers.

These babies are better at paying back their loans than I am
@_date: 2019-09-30 17:50:42
Okay, I loosened my money, what now?
@_date: 2019-09-23 03:27:22
Ahhh, my bad. I misinterpreted the post.
@_date: 2019-09-22 19:55:35
Aren't the stocks, alongside your reasoning, against the post's message then? 
The current outstanding shares for Apple are 4.601 billion, with a stock price of $217.75. Thats roughly $998,417,000,000 total. 
Whereas Bitcoin is priced at $9,975, with aprox. 17,950,000 coins in circulation. Thats roughly $179,051,250,000.
Apple is in fact a better asset in terms of performance.

I guess needed is a relative term. Generally, it's used to grow an economy. This growth allows for more citizens to work, more citizens working means more goods, more goods means more citizens, and citizens with a higher quality of life. 
There is a philosophy in economics of non-interventionism, where the market regulates itself, resulting in a much slower growth and decline. This used to be the standard in fact for the US. While the US tied its currency to gold, it couldn't increase the money in circulation without increasing gold reserves. However, this slow growth was timed during the great depression. So the US cut its currency from gold, and was able to provide cash for massive public works and other economic boosters.
