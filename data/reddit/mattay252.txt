Same here.  I once made it like 30 hours with out at least checking the btc news.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:15:46
Because they like Bitcoin.

I don’t see anyone here panicking.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:00:09
Great idea.  I don’t think anyone has thought of this before. ��
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:07:52
This is a great idea.  It gives aliens more incentive to make contact as well.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:03
I’ve been waiting for him to do a video on this.  It’s hilarious.  I encourage everyone to take a moment to laugh at ourselves. 
Bitcoin users are the vegans of the financial world. We’re always talking about it to anyone who will listen, and feeling superiorioirty for using it. ��
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:59:46
It’s crazy that they discovered this on Rusev day.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:51:18
Because they are looking to diversify their portfolios from spacecoin into alts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:21:57
It’s okay.  We have a a guy here at r/Bitcoin who specialized in Bitcoin related home surgical procedures.

The next recession will happen...  whenever it happens.  Do not try to time any markets.  Just look at things objectively as they are, learn as much as you can, and invest in what seems most reasonable to you.  
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:20:39
I truely hope this happens...   Really want to buy more at a better price.
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:29:19
You're probably right.  But I don't let myself sell ever.  Most of my stocks were from 2008--2010.  Don't want to pay capital gains on it
@_date: 2017-03-05 02:22:16
Just like with the price of gold, at that point people will probanly chime in saying that miles are arbitrary.... ��

I don't really think of it in terms of %.  I used to buy stocks years ago.  Still have them.  But now I only buy crypto .

If we hit another dow all time high I'll be very tempted to sell.   I haven't sold a stock in over 10 years and I like my dividends. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:24:50
It's a stretch, but I think you might be right about that...
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:57:17
I am pro-Segwit.  But I don't think it is right to tell other how to name their coin.  It's their coin, and they call it Bitcoin cash, not b-cash.  
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:50:14
We don't get to rename their coin in order to help them improve their "consideration in branding".  They get to name their own coin.  
@_date: 2017-08-03 16:24:36
Thank you.  I really wish one of the subs could actually be unbiased and a fair discussion of Bitcoin.  The whole "b-cash" campaign makes to hard to take any of the legitimate news here seriously.  
It's their coin.  They get to name it.
Not to mention that every singe one of us now owns both Bitcoin AND Bitcoin cash.  So how about we stop smearing our own holdings?
I come to this sub for news and discussion on Bitcoin.  Not "let's rename the other coin" campaigns.  
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:27:08
Wow, merger of my two favorite worlds...
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:06:21
It's a legitimate concern.  It would be much better if we had daily news of mass retail adoption, rather than new all time highs.  If you are a net buyer of Bitcoin, then these all time highs do not help you at all.
New people constantly posting how they just bought their first coin every single time that we hit an all time high...  That is a huge sign of a bubble.
However--  I really don't care if I lose money on this.  The vision of Bitcoin is money free of governments and banks.  This is about freedom. 
So yes, we might be in a bubble.  And yes I hope the price crashes.  But I am going to keep buying regardless, because to me this is about freedom, and I am honored to take part in this experiment.
@_date: 2017-08-03 18:07:31
I actually agree with you there.  Good point.  
@_date: 2016-11-15 22:09:13
At least with bitcoin, it's much easier for the Nigerian princes to transfer their inheritances to us.  Much better than sending them our bank account info like back in the old days..
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:23:57
Funny thing is, a year ago you would have been predicting it to rise 60%-80% in just a year to get to $1600.  Really, anyone at that time could have rightfully called that crazy optimistic.  And look what happened.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:48:32
Seriously dude, they are just a group of people who prefer Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin.  No conspiracy needed....

This was a holiday weekend in the US.  They will probably get back to you early next week.  In the wild old west of crypto, you have to learn extreme patience sometimes.

If I’m reading it right, it looks like fb went from just under 100 million users ten years ago, to just under 600 million users now.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:03:35
I agree with you.  But don’t confuse risk with volitility.  
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:11:38
If I’m reading that chart right, Bitcoin grew 900% just last year alone, but Facebook has grown less than that over the past ten years combined.

Keep in mind that your Visa cards has similar, if not higher transaction fees that the merchant has to pay.  That's why many places won't accept visa unless you spend more than $10
@_date: 2017-04-01 20:07:31
What?  I'm not proud of anything.  Just pointing out that visa has fees.  ��
@_date: 2017-09-05 00:16:24
Good- but the thing about posting stuff like this online is that you get all the social validation of having done that, without yet doing the actual work.  
I applaud your choice, but please stick with it and do the actual work.  The social validation online is free, but the work of doing it, and overcoming the challenges that will arise is what will really transform you if you stick with it.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:58:45
Pretty cool.  I like how the interviewer was just asking questions and not passing judgements.  I’ve used some of the bitcoin atms in Calgary before and probably will again too.  
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:39:26
Oh and also don't forget about all the shrewd wise long term "hodlers" who just got in to Bitcoin 3 months ago.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:41:57
Make money off Bitcoin?  Most of us here want the Bitcoin, not the cash.
I agree with you that survivorship bias is a thing. But trading rarely works well.  Understand what you are buying, and stick with it.  Trying to time markets is a fools game.

I love warren buffet.  I read his 700+ page biography.  But he has a bad habit of commenting on things outside of his “circle of competence”. Bitcoin and politics being good examples of that.

Completely agree.  And when the correction happens, all of these people who "just bought their first coin" will suddenly disappear, while us long-termers will be buying more.

@_date: 2017-10-19 00:35:02
I love this comment because there are so many long term “veteran” “hodlers” here bought in at 2800 a couple months ago.  Lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 00:32:46
It may not affect the price.  People buying options on the Bitcoin price doesn’t actually mean they are buying bitcoin or changing the supply.  Can’t hurt though.  
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:37:41
Don't forget every single time that we hit a new all time high-  "hey guys I just bought my first coin"
And every time the price drops- "I'm selling"
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:55:43
Lol! I’m sure that’s why...
@_date: 2019-09-17 23:13:33
You have really thought yourself in to a very strange box.  You are young, make decent money for your age and have no student debt.  You can do absolutely anything you want-  move, new job, new skill, new life, new location... anything.  You seem to think that your current (above average) situation will last forever.  It 100% won’t.  The prison is in your mind only.
@_date: 2019-09-18 17:53:07
Because the one thing absolutely guaranteed is change.  The world will be an unimaginably different place when you are 70.   Things may get better or worse depending on your interpretation,  but they will 100% change.  It’s up to you to decide how you will change with it, and what you want out of life.

Checking the Bitcoin price all day is addicting, and trust me I've been guilty.  I think the BEST Bitcoin advice is:
Buy 1 Bitcoin and forget about it for 5 years.  Then spend those 5 years working on your passions and getting as much out of life as humanly possible.
@_date: 2017-05-18 23:32:12
Lol, they didn't say this two years ago.....
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:02:27
I specifically remember buying around 1300 earlier this year, at the time feeling like I was getting ripped off.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:27:14
I wouldn't say it's "bad".  And I check it a lot.  But mostly it is just sort of unproductive..  we could all be doing something more worthwhile than checking the Bitcoin price.  But hey, if you enjoy it, it's a good way to kill some time.
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:46:07
I am still buying.  I look at it this way- I earn more than I spend.  Therefore I have some extra cash.  What should I do with it other than buy Bitcoin?

Question- do the Canadian Bitcoin atms require text verification?  I'll be travelling there soon, and am wondering if I'll be able to buy Bitcoin without a Canadian cell phone.  
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:22:34
Keep in mind that the deflationary nature of Bitcoin discourages people from buying things they don't need.  Which means less trash, less emissions from manufacturing frivolous goods, etc.

I agree Bitcoin has a ton of untapped potential.   But I don't think that chart is to scale.  It drastically overstates the size of Bitcoin, and it understates how much potential Bitcoin has.
