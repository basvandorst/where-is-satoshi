You're saying people's arguments are based on convenience instead of principle?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:56:15
Does he have a choice?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:37:47
I'm pretty sure that's against the sub's rules.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:23
Bitcoin can be attacked, and if an attack makes it incapable of functioning that is an attack vector which is a systemic risk to the coin and would require immediate attention.
If the miners stopped mining bitcoin it would necessitate an emergency difficulty hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:02:18
It probably has to do with people trying to use bitcoin and noticing they can not.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:13:05
Not enough room for transactions in the blockchain. They price is going up because for every transaction that confirms there is more than 0 transactions that does not. People are paying the lowest price they can where they think their transaction will confirm, and on average someone is incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:37:25
How do you propose filling 32 mb blocks with spam enough to hurt throughput or influence fees?
How much money do you have to burn? We can do some math.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:35:11
I own bitcoin and I believe the negative effects to the entire crypto economy would be incalculable if the flagship crypto fails like MySpace.
I would MUCH rather bitcoin win. That said I am hedged because I have little hope of scaling. Lighting doesn't exist yet and the infrastructure will take years build if anyone is there to build it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:38:14
Which part of the whitepaper do you disagree with, and how has Bitcoin improved on that feature beyond what Satoshi envisioned?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:00:15
Well, since he can't send it the 'why' doesn't really matter does it?
HODL isn't a philosophy, it's a rule now.

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:56:29
It was discussed for literally years. The 'time' to do it was before the coin split.
It aint happening without a massive price drop due to the congestion. Full Stop. And even then probably not.
A month ago a 2mb block was a "corporate takeover".
LOL at 'the time is right'.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:11:20
In the short period of a single month this sub decided that using bitcoin is anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:33:08
That's literally what happened.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:36:29
It doesn't matter why they are doing it. A drop in mining power during a fee event is a systemic threat.
If this is a viable attack vector it needs to be corrected. Getting pissy about it does nothing.
IMO: They are doing it because the payout only gets rewarded to miners after 100 blocks. If they are afraid 100 blocks wont happen they will behave like it. 100 blocks is almost a day at the normal hash rate. As the hash rate drops this gets stretched out. As it gets stretched out the risk the day wont get there because no hash rate exists grows.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:04:32
Maybe we should try improving bitcoin so that it can be used instead of attacking people?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:42:22
Let's behave as it if it will. Put all our eggs into the lightning basket.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:27:52
No not at all.
There is no equilibrium value.
It will either keep going up forever if the demand doesn't abate, or it will clear if demand for transactions falls below capacity.
It wont stay the same though. That would require a large number of coincidental things to occur.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:56:48
That's a good point. He could send it with a low transaction fee and hope it's cleared by a year from now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:21:50
I have no idea what a lack of throughput on bitcoin has to do with those things.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:18:12
According to a lightning developer asked just yesterday, "When it's ready". Hopefully that satisfies you because that's what you get.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:44
I love that this sub is anti-satoshi, anti-white paper now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:42:58
Yep. If it works everyone can copy it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:19:52
It is the most legit. It's basically the Walmart of crypto vendors.
This sub is mad at them for offering a competitor coin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:10:00
In the spirit of improving bitcoin...
Bitcoin needs a block size increase asap or else it faces an existential risk.
I believe if it gets one soon it will be the dominant coin for the foreseeable future. If it does not I'm horribly afraid that the resulting crash of bitcoin's value and possibly heart-attack type event with the block-chain could set crypto's back years.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:03:13
Because those are full of dust transactions being consolidated into single addresses.
Dust transactions that exist on Bitcoin too but are utterly unspendable.
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:16:20
I'm unfamiliar with what you are implying. Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-02-28 02:38:38
Doesn't Segwit have sub 30%?
So 70% of miners are 'blocking' 30%?...
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:48:15
Why not?
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:39:48


Fixing what issue? Today's issue?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:09:28
Forcing a formatting change to the construction of transactions would not destroy coins.
You obviously misunderstood me.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:17:58
**That sounds like an awesome addition to a response.** I wish Nullc would have answered me honestly and them wrote what you wrote to explain why it isn't an issue.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:47:53
When did Gavin lose claim to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:31:17
I advocate you guys try really hard to undermine the miners.
It will surely work out for you.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:27:07
Is that what it meant? The answer was "no"? I wasn't clear on that.
Is that what you meant ?
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:31:07


I didn't say the FT format.
I say a different format.
It it totally possible to create a format that is not malleable and can spend old coins. With a hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:45:17
It's different in that it's a blatant attack against miner power, causing miners to feel like they are being attacked by one side. If they just lowered the activation threshold it would simply appear like hypocrisy.
Hypocrisy &gt; War against miners. imo at least.
I'm personally in favor of BU, so I think UASF is a great idea. likes it too. So... It's probably not a good idea.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:37:38
I know that isn't true.
It's fully mathematically possible to reference and prove a spend transaction without making it malleable.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:00:47
It's hard to speak objectively. I think if their goal was to help segwit they failed. I'm not sure if that's what their goal was however.
The **rumor** I heard: Bitclub is claiming it wasn't their intent. They said it was "testing".
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:19:52
I appreciate both you and for giving honest responses that answer my question.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:02:11
What do you mean?
I'm just gently pointing out that attacking miners is a good way to get the miners to side with BU.
Should be rather obvious.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:32:48
Do you think that's a valid attack vector?
How do you propose we could solve it?
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:36:09
I'm in a very large building. No possibility of that.
I'd just love a straight answer from the man himself.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:07:50
I quoted my question. You are clearly unwilling to answer it because the answer does not help you.


Abusive? I just want some shred of honesty.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:23:22
No, I wanted a technical answer from the technical guy himself. I wanted the reasoning why it wasn't a problem, since I didn't know.
Instead he **refused.**
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:04:56
Segwit hardfork + 2mb block size would have been confirmed basically overnight. would have been on board.
But that was then, this is now.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:42:08
I'm not sure what solution this proves is needed. Segwit wouldn't stop a miner from doing this.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:31:18
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:42:42
Segwit wouldn't have stopped this.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:35:27
Is that actually your argument?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:44:31
I'm trying to keep things honest.
Nullc is at this very moment pushing the misconception that this wouldn't have happened with Segwit.
The truth is that the existence of any legacy transactions allows for this. And because Segwit as it currently is implemented allows legacy transactions this can and will continue to be an issue.
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:33:07
I'm guessing ~$800. I'll buy a bit.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:11:15
Than who is it being co-opted from?
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:15:42
It's not a gotcha. I want a technical answer to the question: Would Segwit have stopped a miner from putting a changed transaction into a block?
The answer is "NO".
**If this question did not matter him answering honestly should not matter.** The fact he refuses to answer the question speaks to his motive.
He's welcome to explain why the answer being "NO" (which it is) is not a problem. That is not the route he decided to take.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:32:07
Ask "Do the participants in advocate the supporters of Segwit / core attempt to use UASF if the miners push for BU?" and see what response you get.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:33:13
Concerned meaning what? For my health?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:49:08
I expected far worse actually. At the moment it's no worse than any given 'bad' day.
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:32:52


Using basic (and I mean as basic as it gets) logic, I could equally say the node I'm running is BU therefore it is the only 'valid' chain.
And you would be unable to find a counter-argument because you just accepted the logic. Without being totally hypocritical that is.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:53:42


They wont until / unless they have ~75% of the hash. I believe the can't get 75% of the hash unless they are the economic majority.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:34:24
I agree with everything you just said accept for the implicit assumption that you are in the economic majority.
Also need to point out that the node count is a functionally worthless metric to due the sibyl problem.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:28:33
If you could cite where he said that miners can continue to put changed transactions into a block that would be helpful.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:21:24
No, you were willing to admit that the actual answer is that miners can in fact put changed transactions into a block.
Unlike him.
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:41:49
Instead of compromise the idea of undermining the miner's power is being talked about openly.
Talk about giving the other side an advantage.
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:40:29
I just (wrongly) assumed the spike past $1k was due to the ETF.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:00:44
I get what you're saying, but I also feel like this was a big psychological thing too.
Obviously you were more correct than I was.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:07:24
A soft fork would not have stopped this.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:48:01
It makes an argument for Segwit as a hard-fork, because that would have stopped it. If every transaction HAS TO BE a segwit transaction they couldn't have done it.
With Segwit as a soft-fork (as currently implemented) malleable transactions are still acceptable. They have to be, otherwise it's not a soft-fork by definition.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:14:16
Would segwit as written and implemented have stopped what happened yesterday?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:42:34
No, you mis-understood me.
Would Segwit have stopped a miner from putting a changed transaction into a block?
You're answer was "yes, if literally everyone used **only** segwit transactions".
**Well, not everyone is going to use segwit transactions.**
So, given that information the answer should change.
Edit: The truth is that the existence of any legacy transactions allows for this issue to persist. And because Segwit as it currently is implemented allows legacy transactions this can and will continue to be an issue.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:05:11


That's **not** what I asked.
Please answer the question I asked.


@_date: 2017-03-07 14:30:25
So how did we solve the sibyl attack problem?
I mean, clearly if 'valid' means number of nodes than sibyl attacks are now impossible right?
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:40:31
Awful nice block-chain you've got there. Would be a shame if anything were to happen to it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:02:57
So, again, would Segwit as it currently existed have made it impossible for what happened yesterday to happen?
Everything else equal? No additional assumptions. A clear yes or no please.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:38:21
Who is co-opting bitcoin from Gavin?
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:29:46
It's called stop clearing or stop running. 
If you sweep the price range both up and down it removes all the buy and sell orders. Depending on how they are set up you can make money just doing it, though I'm fuzzy on the details. I think what you do is spike the price up high enough that it 'tricks' the buy orders into thinking the ETF was approved so TONS of people buy. Like a run-away chain reaction. Then you (knowing it's fake) sell at the top.
Otherwise it reduces liquidity and increases volatility, which is good for day-traders.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:32:35
This destroys liquidity btw. Increasing volatility even more.

@_date: 2017-10-10 18:43:30


They have been saying that for over 2 years. I don't believe them. Not a single proactive step has been taken. Just words.


What fact am I denying?
What conspiracy?
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:20:26
Doubling the number of possible transactions sounds like an upgrade to me.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:10:55
They get paid to produce blocks in the coinbase transaction. Your transaction fees are minimal.


I'm guessing they don't care.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:09:58
Soft forks are not optional. My legacy software can't reject it.
Hard-forks are 100% optional. I can choose to ignore they even exist.
In fact I hard-forked today, and you didn't notice.


I think I understand the topic better than yourself.
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:45:10


The only thing you can objectively measure is proof of work.
Provable doesn't mean your assertions. It means provable.
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:30:45
I get the feeling your side only has insults.
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:19:09
Anyone who rejects Proof of Work needs to sell bitcoin asap. And question why they ever bought it in the first place.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:36:11
And exactly how do you determine who is rogue?
Why is this sub pushing the idea that nodes aren't totally sybil attackable?
You can claim you can run whatever software you want and no one can stop you, true. But you can't force your chain to have a hash rate.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:12:03
You aren't arguing in good faith.
Proof of Work is the only thing you can measure.

Is there a futures market that isn't biased toward one chain over the other? Could you point me to it?


What does this have to do with anything I'm talking about?

Personal attack and then claims that 2x is an attack without addressing the fact that **all they are doing is not mining on the 1x chain anymore.** To are mining on an 'alt' chain that you don't have to have anything to do with. No one is forcing you.
I need someone to explain why miners simply not mining 1x is an attack, because that's all they are doing.
Call me names all you want. I don't care.

@_date: 2017-10-11 15:49:23
I've heard people describe 2x as an attack on bitcoin.
Like... all of the time, everywhere I look.
2x is just a fork the miners may or may not decide to mine on.

I'd ask to you to explain, but you'd probably just insult me more.
It seems that's the depth of explanation that permissible.

I mean how do you measure the contribution? What does 1 contribution equal, how do you measure it?
You claim it's an objective measure. Count them for me.

Why do you believe node count matters?
Isn't 2x compatible with ABC and Unlimited as well?

Honest is defined how?

@_date: 2017-10-10 16:25:13
Is a 51% attack when miners do something you disagree with?
Because that's not a very good definition.
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:31:15
I thought it was called the 'economic majority'. When did this sub turn anti-corporation?

@_date: 2017-10-10 20:33:44
I can't ignore the segwit transaction list. It's part of bitcoin regardless with if I agree with it or not.
You totally ignored my points about hard-forks. Why?
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:44:32
Soft-forks don't need unanimous support?
Because what logic?
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:44:03


No you didn't. You ignored my point about hard-forks being totally voluntary, and how I hard-forked this morning and you didn't even notice it happening.


And I had no say in if bitcoin has to carry segwit transactions for the rest of it's existence. that UTXO set is permanent now.
A 2x hard-fork is easily reversed, given the political will. For example.


I don't hate segwit. I'm pointing out your blind spot.


Right back at you. Hypocrite.
Stop claiming "universal support" is necessary and then telling people who disagree to leave. It's absurd.


2x hard fork doesn't affect you materially in any way either.
The miners choosing to not mine on 1x does. And you have no right to claim their hash rate. That's their hardware and choice.
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:19:52
If the split is 95% - 5% than it would be trivial to attack the segwit chain without a PoW hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:06:44


Whatever that means.


They get paid by the protocol (coinbase transaction) and by other people too.


People call 2x an attack on bitcoin.
2x is simply miners deciding not not mine on the 1x fork anymore.
So if quitting is an attack I must presume they owe you their work.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:39:10


Only if you believe non-mining nodes matter. Which they don't.
