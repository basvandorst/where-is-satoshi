I set mine up 2 days ago.  Working really well.  Currently 27 peer connections.  Make sure port 8333 is open on your network.  Also, use an IP scanner to find the IP address once you plug it into your router.  There is a web front end available at   
Thanks for supporting the bitcoin network!!  It’s a good feeling, isn’t it?

Honest question... who do the fees go to?  The vendors or the owners of the channels?

Didn't take me more than half a day to get Tier 3 on Kraken.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:45:30
They all have issues one way or another.  Kraken offers margin, but also charges a maker/taker fee of 0.14/0.24%.  Coinbase/GDAX doesn't have a maker fee.  However, it's NOT EASY getting larger amounts of money into coinbase/gdax.  I'm currently biting my fingernails as I wired a large amount of money to GDAX.  My bank says wire went through fine, however, its been over 36 hours and it hasn't shown up in GDAX.  bittrex is good for alt coins, however, you cannot get USD into bittrex.  You can only send bitcoin.  Bitfinex stopped accepting deposits from US, so they're dead to me.

Its simple supply and demand.  Since about 8/14 a lot of folks were selling between 4000 and 4470.  Thats called supply.  All the supply was eaten up by hungry buyers (demand) from 8/14 to today.  Once the supply is eaten up, we get a breakout.  Now, price will discover the next level of sellers and price will begin to eat through that supply.

Ha, I’m an idiot.  I fixed the date

Try not to react with emotion because money is involved.  I sincerely want a coherent argument for this case.  You can bet the US govt has people thinking about this.
Ok, you edited your response.  Yes, what you are saying makes sense now, especially the part about Coinbase being libel.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:45:52
Ok, cannot find anything on Russian/US transactions.  However, let’s use the two JP Morgan money laundering cases:  Apparently, the gist of the charges are that the bank didn’t do enough due diligence to prevent money laundering, especially in the Madoff case.
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:31:02
That’s good sentiment, but no, you need an ASIC machine.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:53:03
Good argument, but wouldn’t a US regulator argue that, to be a medium of exchange in the United States, bitcoin needs some sort of centralized authority that should be watching?  I don’t know... I guess this can get into a massive legal discussion.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:32:53
Three times since August the community (as a whole) has been fooled.  Don't let "certain miners" do this to you anymore.  The number of transactions on a network directly correlates to a miners profitability.  Guess which network has orders of magnitude more transactions?   In order to be a profitable miner, miners have to follow the transaction count.  Peace!
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:23:42
No, 1%
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:41:33
Agreed.  Sometimes miners piss me off.  They should know by now that it is very important to their longevity to support the right pools.  Wish their was some sort of a reward for long-term support.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:23:48
Boom!!! Nice, tell others as well. :)
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:37:00
Ok true.  I think I need to read up on exactly how US banks are fined for facilitating fraudulent transactions, and then how that might extend to bitcoin.  If the regulation was failing to stop transactions by people or entities on some sort of blacklist, and bitcoin doesn’t have a blacklist... then?
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:19:16
Yes!!!!! It’s really growing fast now... keep doing the right thing miners!  We are up to 923 peta... 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:42:35
It’s just super easy.  Get the stratum address from the front page of Slush.com. Update your miners (or cgminer) with the new stratum address.  The web front end for Slush is the best in the business, and I’m confident you’ll be super happy with all it has to offer.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:32:53
I’m a fairly new miner.  I started on 10/2/2017 at Slush.  On the day I started, I noticed the hash rate of the pool was 585 petahash.  Well, I’m really happy to say that I’ve witnessed it grow 51% as the Segwit2x fork approached.  Many miners are doing the right thing, although I see a lot taking a bad wrap.  I will never switch over to mining Bitcoin Cash because my first priority is the stability of the Core Bitcoin ecosystem.  I hope others will do the right thing as well.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:22:58
Makes sense.  Logical argument.  But, there have been cases were banks were fined heavily for facilitating fraudulent transactions.  How would a penalty such as this doled out by the govt be modified because it was bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:50:32
No way to know for sure, but I think we’ve seen the near-term bottom @ 5510.  Most of the price tank was due to 2 things:
1) Hash power switching from bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash.  This is still happening (  Check out the grey line in the top chart.  Ant pool and other manipulators are pulling hash power.  However, those pools are purely driven by profit (no morals) so they will switch back to BTC as soon as profitability and difficulty forces them .
2) traders buying the BCH/BTC pair.  This trade has already begun reversing
I think if miners keep doing the right thing, and switch to Slush, we can easily beat this attack.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:04:25
I’m a miner and I just posted about Slush.  We ONLY mine BTC and we support Core.  I would implore any miners reading this to switch to Slush.  To me, any short term profitability is not worth jeopardizing the security and speed of the BTC ecosystem.  And side note, mining difficulty and usage will force the greedy back to mining BTC shortly
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:45:08
Marek is the bomb!  Everyone should join this pool.  Marek added a poll for members to vote on fork issues.  The pool continually chooses to support Core.  I mine here and I suggest other miners do so as well.  Plus, their interface is very nice.  I mined at Kano for s little bit, but couldn’t handle such sporadic rewards.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:18:21
I kinda used this argument, however, he reminded me that US banks were fined heavily fined for processing fraudulent Russian/US transactions that had to do with the election.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:49:35
This is a good point.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:13:14
Technically, this is an issue I think.  Say the fraudulent transaction is a result of a crime in the United States.  Let’s say a mining pool in the US wins the block.  Couldn’t the govt go after the owner of the pool and shut it down?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:52:09
It’s called Bitseed.  But seriously Bitseed is sold out right now.  I would buy one of these from you as well.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:34:17
Shut up.  Heard it before for years.  Of course it does.... message me when it happens.  Message me when companies get behind it (more than a handful).  Message me when it’s simplified for the normal man.  I swear to God... JUST MOVE ON.  It’s fucking over.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:38:40
I am only speaking of what IS.... the success of bitcoin is not about what I PREFER.  there are too many idealists in bitcoin.  Governments control the ISSUANCE of money.  Markets control how and when that money is exchanged.

Your fine if you’ve committed little.  Just don’t expect much.  McAffee is a bad guy.  Promotes coins and sells them into the hype.  Not a good human being.

Because I believed in Bitcoin, but when I became a user, that belief began to wane.  I do believe in Blockchain, but not bitcoin
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:03:51
No I actually bought early-ish (July last year).  I’m a trader by profession and I didn’t believe that HODL shit.  I did, however, take my gains and buy miners.  I’ve since sold everything as I just don’t believe anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:26:50
Jesus Christ.  Shut up.

Lol.  I’m warning people.  Don’t be naive.  Don’t commit your life’s work to this.  Trust me.  Just don’t do it.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:06:18
Bitcoin will definitely not be king.  Too many holes.  But I do believe in Blockchain eventually turning into something significant 
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:14:33
I know that’s not early to a lot of people but it was between 2k and 3k I think when I made my first purchase.  Go ahead and try to mock and discredit me because I disagree with you.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:25:39
I see where your going and it’s a good argument for how things will advance technologically.  However, governments control money and they ALWAYS will.  Maybe governments begin to release coins, which can be moved by the technology you speak of.  However, it is my belief that those entities which can threaten with force WILL ALWAYS CONTROL MONEY.
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:29:36
Take it from someone who studied the hell out of it, traded it, bought miners.... then sold EVERYTHING.  It’s garbage.  It needs a military behind it.  Maybe then, it will have long term value.  Plus, it has a fatal flaw... it’s far too slow.  Do yourself a favor and just move on.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:53:25
Bitcoin 5x levered futures came online in that same timeframe.  December 18th to be exact.  My working theory has been whales selling off exchange assets once they hedged themselves with 5x leverage to the downside (selling bitcoin futures contracts or i.e. "going short").  This is why I hate futures.  Whales actually have incentive to tank the market once they are properly hedged.  If they have 5x leverage to the downside why not tank the market on purpose?  You cash out your bitcoin and tanking the market hard gives you huge profits on your short futures contracts.  Ugh.  I never wanted bitcoin futures.  They are nothing but trouble.  I will bet 1 bitcoin he was hedged with futures!

Does that mean the Dragonmints will be faster than 16TH/S if used on the special Slush pool?  Slightly confused here...??
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:35:17
WSJ, Bloomberg and now Charles have said exchanges will be banned.  I'm a huge Bitcoin fan, but I believe that exchanges will be banned in China.  I feel Bitcoin takes a reasonable hit to let some of the hot money get washed out.  But its not going away.. there are a TON of decentralized exchange projects out there.  And, NO ONE can regulate a decentralized exchange.  China truly is shooting themselves in the foot here.  They should be embracing considering how much wealth bitcoin has brought to some of its citizens.  Its definitely a shame.

You are completely missing my point.  Never wanted lambo... tried to create another income stream to support my family of four.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:00:57
Look at my history of posts.  I’m fucking bitter.  Again I warn you.... DO NOT FOLLOW MY PATH.  Forget bitcoin and do something worthwhile with your time.  Do not fall in love with the romance of an “alternative form of money”.  Just don’t fucking do it.  The normal human will stick with government denominated cash.  Governments will never allow bitcoin to truly happen.  Violence is what changes things historically and there is no “bitcoin army” and there never will be.  Nothing will change.
At best, in 15-30 years, the US govt will have its own form of bitcoin, but they sure as hell won’t allow you to mine it.   ITS OVER.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:12:51
Honestly you think the US govt is going to allow Bitcoin to tank the credit card business?? And don’t tell me govts can control bitcoin.  That’s naive.  They can and they already are.  Also, credit cards are coming out with their own Blockchain.  Think of the AVERAGE citizen.  Not bitcoin maximalists such as yourself.  They just want a transaction to go through at the lowest price.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:05:54
No, bitcoin futures are 'disconnected' from the actual physical delivery of bitcoin.  This is another reason I hate futures.  They are cash settled, meaning no bitcoin changes hands by the market makers.
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:54:21
Yes, that is correct.  Coinbase is a wallet and a "fiat gateway" to get your dollars into bitcoin, ether, or litecoin.  Then, if you want to trade your coins, it is free to move your money from Coinbase to GDAX.
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:02:44
Ok, whatever, so I worded it wrong.  These guys mean to profit on the downside too.  If they KNOW they will be selling off 180K bitcoin, which is probably about 1.3% of all outstanding bitcoin (say about 14 mil bitcoin are out there), they know this will tank the market.  Why not set up a situation where they can profit to the downside?  I'm sure it was done.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:09:48
Yes, and at the same time Antpool and other Segwit2x supporters have declined: 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:23:31
Miners will go wherever is most profitable.  RIGHT NOW, btc2x futures are showing that it will not be very profitable to mine btc2x. Also, most exchanges are calling btc2x an alt coin including the 600 lbs gorilla Coinbase.

This is not correct.  I mine at Slushpool and the voting is not even close.  Slush is going w/ Bitcoin core:

If you are a miner and use ANY of the mining pools which are attempting to manipulate the system for their own gain, I highly recommend switching pools.  Slushpool, for example, mines blocks over 1MB -

I have noticed that Canaan Avalon miners are much easier to get than in recent months.  I think companies like Canaan and Bitmain have finally ramped production to “somewhat” keep up w/ demand.  In the recent past, that wasn’t the case.

Just the fact that these issues exist and that these explanations seem necessary, is pissing me off.  This movement is so important and the "general public" won't continue adoption if bullshit like this comes up 2 or 3 times per year.  It kilos confidence.  We gotta stop this crap.
