Okay so I sent $30 in BTC, I set it on 15/sat per byte. Over 24hrs now and 0 confirms. Anyway I can up the fee a little or do I wait it out? will it eventually clear?
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:38:40
kk thanks
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:25:50
I use mycelium wallet, I would up the fee if possible I just have no idea how to. I guess it's just a matter of time?

I don't get all the hate for guys like Jamie Dimon, sure I disagree with him, but his opinion on Bitcoin is similar to my grandpas or most other older people. They are just skeptical of new things, I think it just happens as you get older. 
I don't think he has any interest in shorting it, he said himself he doesn't get it, and has no idea where it will go. He just says it will pop after a while. He could very well be right, none of us have a crystal ball.
Bitcoin is a cool technology, were all here because we like it or are interested in it, but it's not a religion, we don't need to be offended when people say it's not as valuable as we think it is.

People are going to sell if they want, and hold if they want. I'm so tired of these lame manipulative threads, it's always some teenager who thinks he came up with something brilliant. As if this subreddit has complete control over Bitcoins price, and we're all going to listen to this enlightened kid. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:36:45
Shorting is more like, borrow, sell, rebuy later. You never really own an asset until some future point where you buy it yourself, at a predicted lower price.

Do you really believe racism is limited to which term/slur is used? What a ridiculous point to make, you can't believe that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:43:44
You could just give them login info
or just a private key/QR code
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:00:25
If you believe in the technology, speculate where ever you wish. I doubt you'll find many "SciptDrop.io" experts around here.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:49:20
Any links, proof, text etc?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:46:51
Where did you purchase them from?
Your SSN won't mean anything to the Bitcoin network, but if you can prove you bought something from a site, and never received it... and can prove it... who knows
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:25:12
sick casual racism bro

You need make people click the post for the punchline.

We expect a dip with this kind of jump, but predicting Bitcoin in 2017 is pretty futile. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:55:13
Well, the Bitcoin network can run with much less power, so it's not a direct threat atm. 
Is it possible some governments will try to shut down mining operations due to energy concerns? Sure, that will happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:22:14

@_date: 2017-12-06 23:31:27
The idea that the average bank employee in 2017 sees Bitcoin as a realistic threat to their livelihood is ridiculous, it's repeated by the zealots on this sub constantly, but it's not realistic.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:31
This is a pretty quick rise lol
I expect a dip.
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:10:21
How do you fall for this?? lol
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:29:25
But those are all shit countries no?
@_date: 2018-10-11 05:25:44
I pretty glad I sold some of my alts:D
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:38:14
Poloniex also?
*"[–]BTCIV666 1 point 4 months ago 
They froze my account due to my nationality, However they said they will send my coins before they will close my account. We're talking 52k here."*
So he just says all the exchanges froze his accounts? is this the scam?

That's an insane amount of growth for not even a year. This space is just exploding and it's hard to notice when you're inside it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:21:23
Comes across as a very sensitive volatile man.

He's talking about the 4 gospels. Four different versions of the same story.

This has nothing to do with being a newbie to Bitcoin, suckers are just suckers and they often lose money. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:11:53

Just buy bitcoins lol
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:08:20
Yeah fees need to come down, for sure
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:12:23
I don't :X
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:36:35
Sort of interested in seeing what they said about bitcoin, but not enough to sit through a whole episode of big bang theory...
Hope someones posts a summary
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:07:07
He said 10k, 6 days from now. That's pretty close for a summer 2015 prediction imo

I don't think theyre going to care about what this Canadian has to say:E 
GL tho boys
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:05:01
I've heard that but I don't have a great understand of it, if you can explain any better how this could work I'd listen.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:01:42
Stop reading his sub then.
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:43:14
lol I get it
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:06:02
I don't think they're that high, I want to see them lowered also but you're exaggerating. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:35:01
ah just googled it fast didn't even notice
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:10:14

You're a real gambler Alex lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:10:46
Just because you ended up making money doesn't mean it wasn't risky. There's still a lot of risk and speculation in putting large sums of money into crypto, always be careful and stay informed. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:37:29
We honestly need to start using mBTC, people aren't getting this part...
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:04:03
The market cap of bitcoin is twice what it was at the time of that article, also the scaling was criminal to begin with. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:50:41
Maybe people were advertising bitcoin sites or something with their tag ingame. Doesn't have to be an insidious reason. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:55:54
Don't tell people about your bitcoins.
Except on reddit, this is fine.
I have bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:08:34
Why does it feel like every post on all these crypto forums are manipulative? I feel like you're trying to manipulate me, these BCH guys are trying, all the altcoin guys are the exact same. If I make any decision it won't be based on these nonsense threads. I really hope newcomers to this space don't read threads like these and think the crypto people are all lunatics. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:10:20
I feel like being able to transfer easily and cheaply is just as important..
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:33:05
And.... I have no idea what this reference is
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:32:35
I think people make predictions based on past behavior. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:08:16
I'm sort of surprised, I always knew bitcoin was divisible like this, since the first time I heard of it, 4-5 years ago. 
Too bad we don't just measure it in mbtc, would be easier for people to use.
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:53:04
Lol I'm annoyed by them, I don't get the reference, never watched the show.

It's just a joke, lighten up.

An endorsement from a dope like Glenn Beck is at best a mixed blessing. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:41:45
The market cap would have to be 21Trillion for this to work out? I don't think there are enough humans to enable that even if everything went well. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:01:59
They weren't writing what they experienced, they wrote what they heard or read from others. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 05:48:40
What a great read! really interesting, I thought they were gone for good. 
When you paid that kid .85btc I was like "nooooooplzzzz wait"
