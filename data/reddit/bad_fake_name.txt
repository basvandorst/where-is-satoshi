The only thing that either of them can prove is that Dorian is Satoshi.
Satoshi can sign a message that says "I'm not Dorian" if he wants to.  He can also sign a message that says "I'm not Satoshi".  He is unable to prove the negative.
The only proof that can come out of this is if Dorian signed a message using Satoshi's key.  There is no signed message that can prove anything different, because they could easily be lies.

Oh, sure, but that still requires him to reveal his own identity.  Which the OP said he wouldnt' have to do.
Also, that still gives Dorian, if he is Satoshi, the opportunity to 'hire' someone to play Satoshi while plausibly denying that he is Satoshi.
The only proof that a crypto message can provide is that Person A is, in fact, Person A -- or that Person B is also known as Person A.  A signed message cannot be proof that Person A is *not* Person B, because that's not what it's designed for.

That's my problem with this whole stinking pile.  He has no way to prove that he doesn't own those bitcoins now.  And there's not much evidence, but if it's enough for a crackpot reporter to write about then it might be enough for someone of less moral integrity to go after.
This guy's in the spotlight now, whether he's the real Satoshi or not.  Now there's a giant target on this guy, his family, his friends, and anyone else out there.
If the real Satoshi swoops in and says "He's not me", then what happens?  Obviously now, Satoshi gives a shit about this guy's safety.  Now he's an indirect target to get to Satoshi.

Sadly, the reverse of this confusion is what stopped me from investing in BitCoin way back when.  "Why would I pay $1 and just get 5 bit "coins" for it?
The name, having 'coin' in it, implied a sense of parity with a native fiat currency.  Oh how wrong I was.
The name of the currency has absolutely no bearing on what it should be worth to you.  Don't let that psychological barrier get in your way.  'Coin' doesn't imply cent, 100 bitcoins doesn't imply $1.00, nor does $1.00 imply 1 bitcoin.
It fluctuates based solely on how much people more educated than us believe it to be worth.  Could end up worth 5 cents, could be $5,000.

You could try any of the major exchanges - mtgox.com bitstamp.net btc-e.com among others.
Coinbase is more a broker than an exchange - they'll facilitate the buying and selling, but if you want to do instant USD-to-BTC trades and that, you need to use one of the exchanges.
Once the BTC is usable in your Coinbase account, you can make an account at MtGox or wherever, and send the BTC over there to trade.   But unless you're experienced in day-trading, all you will find is heartbreak watching your USD/BTC slowly drop from badly-timed trades.

The public address that you send bitcoin to is not actually the public key of that person/wallet:  it's a hash of the public key.
Simplified, it's like this:
Private key generates public key, public key is hashed into public address.
The hash is (practically) irreversible - so knowing someone's address does not mean you know their public key.  When you send a transaction out, you essentially say "I'm giving 1BTC to whoever can provide the key to this address: 1b0wbi2...."
Afterward, the owner of that address comes out and says "Yeah, that's mine, here's my public key (which will turn into that address when you hash it) as proof."
After that, now the whole network has that public address.  Which is (practically) irreversible as far as determining the private key; but who knows.  
Some bitcoiners wouldn't want to keep the BTC in that wallet any longer due to the risk someone might reverse-engineer their private key and get it all, so they'll send it to a new address whose public key isn't in the wild.
This is all my understanding of it.  If you want my source, [this article]( was posted earlier.

That's not possible, at least if the block is to be accepted.  Every block hash has to include the previous block hash, so it's literally impossible to 'skip' a block like that.
I can't make block 10 until block 9 has been found, because I have to include a hash of block 9 in my block 10.  And if the hash of my block 10 (which includes a rehash of block 9) doesn't meet the block requirements, it's no good to anyone.

While technically true, I don't think anyone was silly enough to lose that much money on minting a bitcoin that's only worth some dust.
Most likely, they were pretty darn valuable when they were made which could've been up to a couple of years ago; and if that's the case they would probably be about the level of pallet-of-dollars valuable by now.

You're dealing with a USA bank account via Coinbase, you're not going to be able to trade the ups and downs instantly.
Once those BTC are available to use, you certainly can sell them back at Coinbase.  But then you'll have to wait about 3 business days for the deposit to hit your bank account.
