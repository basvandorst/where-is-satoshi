It's also hoped my post history shows that. I applaud your professionalism on this matter Eric. It wasn't because you constructed 30+ tweets about $NEO that were poorly researched was it?

Even if we don't know nothing or no one can predict the price/technology of Bitcoin in the future, you (Andreas) and we all know this is the next big financial revolution of our time and it's happening right now. The adoption will be slow but I'm sure Bitcoin and block chain will have a major impact.

There are tons of better ways if a concern is truly a novel idea than logging merges into a source report... If on the off chance a patentable idea showed. It means that a pull request was accepted into the bitcoin core repository. Thank you! That is a very kind offer :)
