A few more little bits of nitpicking:
1) I think '...which charges users the full cost to post transactions (the term healthy transaction fee market is defined in Section 7).' should be changed to '...which charges users the full cost to post transactions. (The term healthy transaction fee market is defined in Section 7.)' as the words in brackets seem to make a sentence by themselves.
2) 'Huoy showed that if the marginal cost to a miner to add a transaction to a block was zero' -&gt; 'Huoy showed that if the marginal cost to a miner to add a transaction to a block WERE zero' - (if you want to use the subjunctive)
3) Perhaps change '...equal to the amount he would earn if he won the block multiplied by his probability of winning' to '...equal to the amount he would earn if he won the block, multiplied by his probability of winning'
4) The list of 'KEY WORDS' is a numbered list, so I believe you should replace the full stops with semicolons
'1. Bitcoin. 2. Block size limit. 3. Transaction fee market. 4. Blockchain spam.' -&gt; '1. Bitcoin; 2. Block size limit; 3. Transaction fee market; 4. Blockchain spam.'

I'm brand new to Bitcoin but can't buy any more right now. Please tip me :)
p.s. I give 10% of what I earn to charity, for the charitable part (not for religious reasons, just because it feels about right)

Great job! Here are some things that could be changed (some I feel may be necessary, others just for clarity):
1) 'A pressing concern exists over the ramifications of changing (or not) a Bitcoin protocol rule called the block size limit' -&gt; 'A pressing concern exists over the ramifications of changing (or not changing) a Bitcoin protocol rule called the block size limit'
2) 'A healthy transaction fee market would develop which charges users the full cost to post transactions' -&gt; 'A healthy transaction fee market would develop, which charges users the full cost to post transactions' - comma after 'which'
3) 'The miner's surplus is greatest when the gap between M demand and M supply is a maximum' -&gt; 'The miner's surplus is greatest when the gap between M demand and M supply is at a maximum' - clarity
4) '...as urgent higher-paying transactions necessarily bump lower-fee transactions out, thereby bidding up the minimum fee density' -&gt; '...as urgent, higher-paying transactions necessarily bump lower-fee transactions out, thereby building up the minimum fee density' - comma between two adjectives (urgent and higher-paying), perhaps replacing the word 'bidding'
5) '(the demand that would exist if the price was different)' -&gt; '(the demand that would exist if the price were different' - if you want to use the subjunctive
6) 'Tradeblock performed a careful study where they measured the time it takes on average for new block solutions to be accepted by 50% of the nodes they were connected to.' -&gt; 'Tradeblock performed a careful study where they measured the time it takes on average for new block solutions to be accepted by 50% of the nodes to which they were connected.' - Prepositions are not something to end a sentence with :)
Hopefully at least one of these is helpful and you don't find me TOO pernickety :)
I am new to Bitcoin, so if you appreciate any of these, I would hugely appreciate some BTC (1BEjVsQJ2QsQ2PRuC1mGUSiowbSLeUQQbV) :D

I just wanted to ask if you had seen any of the 10 possible corrections I suggested. I really don't mind if they're not worthy of the $10 bounty, but I'd love it if you could at least consider using them because they took me a while to come up with :)
