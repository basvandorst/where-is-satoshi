These scumbags will be difficult to track if they use Monero to cash out. Verge... don't listen to the Mcafee hype.

There is nothing to stop anyone moving the funds. The issue comes when they try to cash out the bitcoins to fiat. 
The bitcoin blockchain is a totally transparent database where every single coin can be traced forever. If the source is tainted, 10 years down the line and after 1000 transactions, the coins are still identified as tainted.
The only way to get around this right now for bitcoin users is to shapeshift the hell out of those coins back and forth into different privacy cryptos before cashing out.

Unless those raiders have any brain, they will get tracked once those bitcoin gets converted to fiat.

CoinJoin is known to not work. Half a brain criminals using this service deserves to be locked up. Far better option is to shapeshift and use Monero as the final crypto to cash out.

If you ever have the fortune to find out, prenups are a waste of money and time - doesn't hold in court. The law is rigged and not in men's favor. They all collude to steal as much as they can from men that can pay so it is in their interest to keep the racket going.

Haven't been keeping up with the news,. Where did you get the 96% of btc by 4% wallets and Bitmain in financial difficulty? Thanks.

I build up to 31and got greedy playing the market. Now, I have about 21. So don't get too greedy everyone. Better to buy and just gold for the long term.

Who else? Everyone that hasn't sold yet. It's done by scaring the leftovers to the point that they can't handle the stress and pain much more. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:07:15
Run some numbers and look at the charts. If my assessment is correct, Bitcoin may stay below $3k for some time if it does get that low. 
If you haven't unloaded already, then holding and waiting for this storm to pass may be the best option. No reason to sell any now as it is nearly $6k. Selling now means instant loss. Holding and waiting for it to rise, and it will rise again, will preserve your stash and future capital.

Very few did. I wish I did.
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:48:57
If you decide to hold, make sure you can handle the stress if it does go down much lower. I lost over 90% of my money trading a particular alts this year and had to sell in the end. Not a good feeling.

It's more like distributed than decentralized. That's what Bitcoin is.

So is everyone else lol!

I think anyone who purchased btc near $20k will have to sit on the loss for a long time. I said btc will drop below $3000 before any signs of recovery in the past but noobs who bought at the top were so bullish. For the rest of us who bought much lower, we just have to wait it out.

If you got in so early then obviously you know more about bitcoin than the majority here. Yet you want opinions from redditors?
@_date: 2018-02-28 23:19:32
If you want privacy,  you can always shapeshift to other cryptos that includes privacy coins before sending it back to your new address.

Sounds like you think women has it together.  Most women without a man or free state handouts are broke. This is despite having some earning a high income.
You are right, the person taking a man's money is most likely a woman - courtesy of the family court.

They have to cash out to fiat in the end - so you can follow the trail assuming it is still bitcoin. But it is unlikely law enforcement will use their resources to help your friend.

If people want to sell because they see the price plummeting, they are free to do so. Why convince anyone of the tech behind bitcoin if the only reason they got in was to make free money? 
I bet you these are the same people that were panic buying when the price was rising frantically.
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:05:57
Men makes thing happen. We build everything. If women want equality, they can use their brain to earn themselves. If they want privilege, there is always a man to leech off from.

I have no personal issues at the moment, thank you for asking. I do however, see huge potential with Monero going forward and positioning my trades accordingly.
As for suggesting that I infuse my own problems, have you re-read what you wrote yourself? I confirm I am neither a woman or a white knight.

Trying to ban cryptos will only encourage and legitimise the value it has and make future cryptos more stealthy. If you believe in the tech and believe the tech will free us from the  corrupt money system, then giving up means returning to the plantation.
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:22:41
Jumping to conclusions is not my forte. I did not talk about child support directly or implied that I am suffering the consequences of having fun. I merely brought up a valid point about white knights putting women on a pedestal and you appeared to be triggered. 
I am not interested in having a debate or argument with you if all you do is trying old female tactics on me. I have nothing to gain by highlighting the current social issue. In fact, if you become a future victim then it is only to my benefit. I have more women with cash to sell my goods to!
I assure you I am not a victim myself and my portfolio management skills is doing well for me. Thank you for your concern.

Alessio is an idiot. He did a podcast back in 13/14 alongside Max Keiser talking about bitcoin and dismissing the tech. He was adamant the fad will die and recommended people, including his friend, not to invest. He was busy promoting his trading course back then and by the looks of it, business must be quiet now because all he talks about is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-01 11:10:51
If you believe the charts, Bitcoin may go lower than today's level. If you are sitting on profits then it probably is wise to lock in some value by selling and buy back at possiblt cheaper prices. But it makes no sense to sell now if purchased at recent highs. 
People do buy green and sell red, so nothing is out of the ordinary.
