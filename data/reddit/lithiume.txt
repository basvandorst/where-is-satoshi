thanks for your response! So basically it can't be that BTC is the 'Altavista' (major search engine before google for ppl who don't know) and there is another Google around the corner, or is this still an option? Like banditcleaner2 stated... interesting

Yeah I know what you mean, but that massive adoption confidence 'BTC moon' '100K' etc etc. Is it always gonna be BTC? Because the genie is out of the bottle and there can't be a bigger network even if a newer / faster / better chain comes along? Lets compare to trying to catch up to Google scanning books, in a way is BTC adoption already so much widespread it is the only base? Is that why we are all so confident? Hope u get where Im coming from

Srs question. I read all the basic books on bitcoin / blockchain etc. but Im still wondering: where does all this confidence come from. I mean, I get that the tech is innovative and has the potential to change the world like Antonopoulos states. However, who is to say not some other 'coin' comes along and takes its place? I cannot find an answer to this anywhere. Not talking about alts but some radical new blockchain technology. The 'new' btc? eg is it possible btc is HDDVD and blu-ray is around the corner? (shitty example) ppl seem so confident and seem to neglect this as a possibility and I'd love to know why.
