Maybe in the U.S. of A. but you must remember this is Greece we are talking about.  The culture of tax evasion is the norm, it's just the way the Greek people live, day to day.  In fact, if you're a tax collector in Greece and you actually do your job instead of looking the other way, you will be ostracized by the community.  It's a very different mentality, and accepting EU austerity at this point is like giving in to the evil overlords, or so the Syriza is trying to spin it.  Tsipiras is all in on the commy train now.
I found Michael Lewis' book *Boomerang* very insightful to this very point regarding Greece and how it impacts the financial dealings over there.  It does a good job of relating the culture of each country to how they handle their finances, a very worthy read.

I would argue Spain is actually worse off..

Excellent point, but we are still in the fledgling early adopter days.  Events like what is happening in Greece will at the very least bring up the conversation of what will be feasible going forward.  And once (if) the snowball gets rolling, I reckon it will roll pretty fast.

Ya.  You could totally be right, I've not jumped into deep detail on it and that sounds like it could be true.  Like I said, I'm not an accountant and these things all seem to be semi-fluid, but [this]( should be a pretty good primer. The link straight to the IRS source relating to the $200 requirement I described is for some reason not letting me access it, but maybe you'll have better luck?

This is true, but on a transactional basis, I believe that currently the capital gain needs to be over the threshold of $200 in order for the IRS to require you to report it.  Or is you hold more than $10k in USD value of BTC at any one time you must also meet reporting requirements on your taxes. 
 I think people are misunderstanding this article.  It's not a taxation on your purchase like your state tax on your snickers bar, I believe this would just in effect remove the current $200 capital gain reporting requirement per transaction.  Although I'm sure if you were audited they'd track every single goddamn transaction, which would be a huge pain in the ass come tax time, not item purchase time.  Or I could have no clue what's goin' on cuz I skimmed this.

if you do find something more concrete let me know!   I was hoping to not have to worry about all my (most of my) transactions for taxes.

Yes, but how would you go about buying practically any altcoin?  You buy bitcoin first. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:30:02
There *could* be, and that would be cool , but as of right now the only altcoin exchanges that exist run through bitcoin.  Unless I'm missing something..

Dollar hedge, Fed (in)decision &amp; the European VAT Tax ruling, to name a few.  This main advance started the day after the VAT tax ruling, with substantial buying driven from Europe and has accelerated as evidently the Fed delay wasn't priced in as early as it had been in more mature markets.  But you're also right that there is an irrational exuberance factor (probably a good chunk of the large amount of Chinese buying).

If you're implying a significant effect from a sheer money supply standpoint, it's pretty silly to insinuate that's the driver of any huge move given the market cap of BTC is like $7B last I knew.  Sure, it's not trivial, but it's not gonna make huge waves IMO.
