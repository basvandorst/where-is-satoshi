When you opened the coin, was there a SNES inside of it?

Seriously what have our bank accounts ever done for us?

What is love, Mommy?

It's... different!

I bet One Bitcoin that there is SHIT on that drive.

Can't even trust the Memes these days with that crazy Bitcoin.
In my day, when I was young, we traded Bitcoin for 500 Doddaknockers and we were happy with it.

By now we're at least in the early majority part of the cycle, aren't we?

Because for the public money = coin. That is why the adoption of Bitcoin takes so long and that is why we are able to comortably get on the train early (earlier) than common folks.

There is him, and there is me. I sold 2 Bitcoins couple of months ago to buy a fancy Ikea-Table.

Ah, don't mention that. I had 120 Ethers. Sold them too. $ 14 even sounds about right. Must have been like half a year ago? Not sure.
I have 8 ETH left. How many do you have?
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:22:44
But what about lacation? That's important too, right?
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:17:40
haven't we reached 2400 already?
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:06:24
You're not alone. The thing is, I could have 20.000 in Ethereum.
But WOULD I have 20.000 in Ethereum? Because I sure as hell would have taken 10.000 out AT LEAST.
Humans are just not built for this kind of thing. Best thing would be to store some bitcoin or ETH or whatever away and FORGET about it. Then after 10 years you remember.

Seriously. I'm too busy spending my money to deal with this.

that story is scarier than everything I can find on /r/nosleep
