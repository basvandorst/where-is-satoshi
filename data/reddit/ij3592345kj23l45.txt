Ethereum  competes on different aspects that bitcoin doesn't compete in so they're not mutually exclusive.  Ethereum  is for the whole dapps/ico type of stuff. So  Ethereum might be used more like a "virtual stock exchange" or smart contracts type of network whereas bitcoin competes on store of value and medium of exchange (lightning network).

Let's just say, it would be more beneficial to just use the computing power to mine BTC rather than try to crack it.

Let's just say back when BTC was $10 I was considering buying $20,000 worth of BTC off mtgox. I had the money sitting in my account so I could do it. Made the mistake of not buying =/ Big regret.
@_date: 2019-05-25 02:26:23
You can use bitcoin to buy gold but you can't use gold to buy anything....that tells you something.
@_date: 2019-05-26 06:55:46
Okay so take 8k and multiply it by 500. You get $4,000,000 now divide it by 12k which is 333. Now multiply that number by pie (3.14). You will earn $1,046.67.
Good luck

The US stock market and US real estate....and there is solid evidence to support it as well. First, the 3month-5year yield curve is inverted. An inverted yield is a strong indicator of upcoming recession occurring within 2-6 quarters from the date of inversion. Second, duke university released their quarterly CFO survey. That survey showed that 40% of US CFOs believe the US economy will be in recession by q1 2020 and 80% think the US will be in recession by end of Q1 2021. This survey actually has a strong correlation as a predictor of recessions.

Lol, some of you guys on here just crack me up. Please stop with all the hating, it just makes the community look like a bunch of college-age frat idiots. The truth is....competition, marketing, innovation etc is basically everything. The only reason bcash was created was because they wanted bitcoin to basically be a medium of exchange with low transaction fees. That's understandable and it was a legitimate gripe since bitcoin had very high transaction fees.....but now bitcoin has lightning network and I think that solves the issue. People need to stop with this whole "battle of the altcoins". This isn't college sports and it drives people away from this community. You're hurting bitcoin, not helping it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 22:05:14
oh yeah, that's right. I think it is called a "dead man's switch"?
but still, realistically speaking, I don't think anyone really does that in practice unless you've got a massive amount of BTC saved (tens of thousands of dollars worth at least).
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:57:43
[meetup.com]( just type bitcoin into the search bar with the location. Try to find the biggest groups and to go to their "mingle" events. The ones I go to are focused on miners so the people there always have bitcoin to sell.

I work for a government entity and let me tell you...this type of stuff is common in all parts of the government. I just laugh when I see people say stuff like "we need the government to solve this problem."  If only they knew what really goes on.
If you think of the government similar to the mafia, then it makes sense.

I wonder how many dopes are reading this and have a bunch of crypto sitting in exchanges.

Here is the kicker to the POS issue.
Look at countries like China. They've already completely adopted "mobile payments" into their POS. Most of the payments over there are being done through alipay and wechat pay (I think that is the name of it?). From what I understand the payer or merchant scans a QR code on the POS register or mobile phone and the transaction is processed in that fashion. People load up funds to their alipay or wechat pay balance by bank EFT. Many people use it as a form of checking account.  See this video:  [
So how does this relate to bitcoin? The magic is with the lightning network. With lightning network, it works exactly the same as alipay or wechat pay. You have BTC in your mainnet wallet and then send the BTC to the LN wallet. The LN wallet runs on your phone and payments are often done through QR codes or similar variant code scanned. At the POS machine, the buyer is shown a QR code...which the buyer scans with the LN wallet. The buyer approves the payment which gets confirmed within seconds. Buyer and merchant complete the transaction, everyone is happy.
The case in point here is that we can already see in China that mobile payment systems definitely work! In fact mobile payments there are so successful that some merchants do not even accept bank cards at all.

I've heard of lots of alternatives that are trying to compete with bitcoin but the problem I usually see is that bitcoin has the history behind it and the first mover advantage so it is hard for new technology to really compete. Plus you have stuff like lightning network for the medium of exchange aspect of bitcoin. I guess there are weaknesses in the POW algorithm due to miner concentration but I think if that really gets to be a serious enough issue then it might be possible to fork the chain to some sort of different method. That's the beauty of bitcoin...it is democratic and can be modified as needed going forward. The vast majority of the community is focused on maintaining the unique aspects of bitcoin which make it valuable.
@_date: 2019-05-25 02:24:27

This is the correct answer. People say that bitcoin has a lot of hacking/fraud etc but nothing compared to what you see with credit cards and regular banking. The problem is that the regular banking system is designed for convenience, not security.

I watched that documentary today. It was mostly a shill documentary for how great gold is. There was even some dude in the documentary that was talking about bitcoin and saying stuff like "how do I know it won't be hacked and make more bitcoins" etc. which is like 100% clear sign that when someone says that about bitcoin they have no clue how bitcoin even works.
It is so funny watching documentaries like that because these people are under the impression that we will go back to using gold as a standard.

It helps big time because it creates an ecosystem for using bitcoin. It is more popular than you would expect it to be. Back in the day you could tip people with bitcoin directly through reddit by using some bitcoin tipping bot. I earned like 10-15 bitcoins just through making comments. No joke. For twitter it could be the same. Like a comment/post? give a tip. How about that shirt in the image. You can buy it directly through twitter by using bitcoin. Just think of all the people who are too afraid to use bitcoin right now because it is too technically complex. Twitter will break the ice for these people. They'll see how easy it is to use on twitter, buy some...test it out...then go on to download the cash app (with LN wallet inside) and so on.
I've been preaching this for years now....the big problem with bitcoin at this point is purely marketing and teaching people how to use it. Especially with LN coming up these days. LN has massive potential in social media. I think it even has the potential to make bitcoin the internet's money. It will be hip and posh to use, unlike old banking apps we have these days.

What I found really interesting was how there was talk about coinbase, gemini etc. It almost sounds like this facebook crypto is going to have some sort of way to exchange BTC for the facebook crypto and vice versa. Could bring in a lot more people into BTC.

The reason people say that is because we want to encourage business to accept bitcoin. Every business basically uses sales/revenue as basically their lifeblood so they're CONSTANTLY watching it. If they see that their customers want to pay with bitcoin...then guess what? Magically they learn how to accept it.
If no one wants to actually spend bitcoin then what incentive is there for a business to put the time or effort into accepting it? It is a waste of time in that case.
I've spent bitcoin in the past and guess what I did after? I just bought some more. It isn't difficult. Spend $500 USD in bitcoin....buy $500 bitcoin from an exchange.
Just remember, you can't play both sides of the fence. If you want bitcoin to grow in value and use then you need to actually be doing your part. You can't just be holding bitcoin as an investment and then never spend it....meanwhile all of your personal expenses are being paid for with fiat using visa/mastercard etc.
The reality is the vast majority of the world is poor. They have no money to invest in bitcoin but they do have daily living expenses. They would gladly put their small amount of fiat cash into bitcoin if it could be used to pay for daily expenses. That's why it is important to get more merchants to accept bitcoin.

The problem is that there are so many people here doing it that you can't really talk about anything else lol. Plus the manner in which people do it drives people away. You guys attack the author when someone asks about it. It is one thing to educate someone on the topic and it is a completely different thing to basically attack the person asking the question.
@_date: 2019-05-24 19:34:46
I'm just saying that doing that creates a toxic community atmosphere which discourages people away from this community.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:45:34
and if you did something illegal then you get paid a visit to say the least.
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:48:19
This is the correct answer. I've had something similar happen to me as well. Any site that has crypto related to it was getting compromised. I used the same login/passwords on all sites. Luckily I had nothing in these accounts so I just deleted them after they were compromised. Change all passwords, enable 2fa on all banking stuff etc.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:20:32
There is a problem though....most BTC supporters are absolute shit at marketing BTC to the average joe. That's where Dorsey comes into play. He has a huge platform with hundreds of millions of lemmings using. The second you add BTC network to twitter then suddenly millions of these lemmings will be encouraged to start using BTC. It is a net positive.
@_date: 2019-05-26 00:34:24
What about for treasuries?
@_date: 2019-05-25 03:25:06
That's because you can't really do onchain solutions on BTC main chain due to fees. So off chain solutions need to be created (LN etc.). That's the reality.
@_date: 2019-05-28 21:45:33
It is true to a certain extent because bitcoin can be updated if some really beneficial algorithm comes. I think it will eventually happen if everything shifts to lightning network and the "fee network" aspect of bitcoin starts to dry up. People aren't going to mine for nothing.
@_date: 2019-05-25 06:26:42
When I used it was basically free....like if you priced it in US dollars it was like .000001 US cent lol It is really great technology. You definitely need to start using it.

What is interesting about Schiff is that he lives in Puerto Rico. People living in PR aren't subject to us federal income tax and PR has a program where businesses and investors can get 0% capital gains and 4% corp tax. So Schiff is making millions off speaker fees, consulting fees, and investment services but only pays at most 4% tax. Pretty genius.
