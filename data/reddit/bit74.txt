2. enter my bitcoin privet key (same as the above address) for the bitcash in coinomi
3. enter my bitcoin privet key (same as the above address) on the bitgold in coinomi

It's a blessing is disguise. now maybe the crypto world will be less ICO FOMOS/scams and Bitconnect like scams. NOTHING CAN STOP BITCOIN. can it drop to 1000$? yep can it go to 50,000$? yep, can it disappear? never.

Take a chill pill and go watch Bee movie.
“According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyways. Because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.”
