Thank you for that link, it was very helpful (I skimmed it but could tell it was informative and not sensationalized). 
I haven't been pushing but kind of nudging him to move from unsound investments to bitcoin but he literally thinks it's tokens of the internet. He thinks you go to an internet cafe and instead of going to and arcade and paying with token you pay with tokens. It's frustrating explaining to him why he's wrong and how it works but he's a man of reason so if I show him statistics, facts, etc, he will come to his senses.

I know I shouldn't respond to a troll but my father actually is smart man and he's proud that I am exploring new methods of making money which is including but not limiting to Bitcoin.

Awesome thank you, I know these will come in handy later on.

Oh no don't get me wrong I had $10,000 in savings and quickly doubled it to $20,000 which is what got me out of doubt. I just love my dad and want him to make smart investments. He invested $5,000 when Facebook when public and lost money selling at $40 a share.
He literally compared Bitcoin to the internet version of Chuck E cheese tokens and it kind of annoyed me after he told me he lost money on Facebook stock.

I agree, I'm not telling some random person to invest in this and they'll double their money guaranteeeeeed!!!!!
I am strictly speaking about my father, I guaranteed (if you had bothered to read my posts) that I could easily double his money with Bitcoin. That isn't the case anymore, the price seems pretty stable at $600+, so I simply told him to invest SOME money in Bitcoin not only to help out but also because he can understand what Bitcoin is.

There is no case, they are protected by the first amendment. He could request, actually we could all request the article to be taken down.

That's the thing my dad is aware of the whole e-gold scandal and brushes it off as the new "poniz scheme." After showing countless papers and articles about Bitcoin he shrugged it off as being the new ponzi scheme. I simply want my dad to understand that Bitcoin is the future, and it is here to stay. It's so stable now that I don't want him to become a day trader but rather a small supporter.

What happened to being innocent until proven guilty?

I never thought of that to be honest, I have three paper wallets and four wallets on encrypted usb drives. I truly never thought to convert these wallets into actual money, thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:09:46
I agree. It is easier to look at the past rather than looking towards the future.

Good for you man, I did the same against everyone's wishes and I came out debt free. I wish I could claim become rich off Bitcoin but nope just paid off my student loan which in my opinion, is a win for me.

Son, you just went full retard, never go full retard.

Exactly, I don't see early adopters of Bitcoin as lottery winners because I truly believe that they believed in what Bitcoin could eventually become which is why you see early adopter's wallets with so many Bitcoins not move a cent. 
A lot of people fail to see that though, they think Bitcoin is just a quick money scheme but you see accounts that have not moved at all since the establishment of Bitcoin and though we understand their intentions the ignorant think they're just waiting to cash out, it's a hard concept to explain and I'm hoping to shed some light on it.

I rubbed my belly and the price went up!

I agree, I've been holding onto some Bitcoin since years and yes I converted some to fiat but only cause a need called for it but other than I hold. I wasn't telling my father "hey give me $20,000 and I will return you with $40,000." I simply told him that instead of saving random cash into random accounts he should buy Bitcoin, not to make a profit but to help the cause and also to prove that it's stable.
