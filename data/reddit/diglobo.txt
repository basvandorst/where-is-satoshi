Well, you have your private key to recover those, so not permanently gone :)

I do not have an updated iOS device at hand :( sorry, but best of luck with that version, and if you get around to making the Android one, I'd love to test it!

Yeah, I would beta test no problem! As long as the APK returns clean from a scan I can have a little play with it.  Please write to REDACTED and we can take it from there if you'd like!
Good luck with the development man :)
Edit - realised having my email out there may not be a good idea, hah

I started getting money into crypto in September, but I am not the most technical of users!
I generally use different exchanges for different things, namely:
Bitstamp and GDAX to buy and sell bitcoin, litecoin or ethereum.
Binance to buy other cryptocurrencies which I am interested in and are unavailable in GDAX (zero commissions on limit orders is hard to beat).
I usually try to keep my stacks in a mobile wallet (yes, not the most secure, but my lifestyle would be so much worse if I had to keep big pieces of paper around with me, as I travel a lot). I generally use different mobile wallets, but mainly using the Enjin Wallet, which is getting an update to import and create multiple wallets (with multiple mnemonic seeds) and that could prove useful.
I have thought about a hardware wallet in the past but I feel like that will just be another gadget to carry with me, and don't have enough skin in the game to be bothered to buy one.
I try to trade as little as possible, and mainly on the buy side. Overtrading is very much a thing in crypto, and you might be very much in the red due to it. A way to not feel pressed to trade is to just not have an available portfolio to look at, and leave your funds in a paper wallet.
My use case for bitcoin has been transactions to other parts of the world, and in the future would hopefully be related to Ln spending at markets etc, however, I mainly see the purpose of other cryptos (i.e Monero and the privacy bunch) as the better option for shady transactions, which were the main means of bitcoin trading before this speculative period.
So, TLDR: buy bitcoin in a good, cheap exchange (Bitstamp is quite alright), keep it in a wallet you trust and can keep with yourself, or just create the wallet and keep the words to recover it later, don't overtrade or daytrade (are there even "days" in a 24/7 market?) And believe in the future use cases, which are replacing fiat (hopefully) and doing semi-anonymous transactions.
