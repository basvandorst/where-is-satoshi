Oh of course we can't have it peeling up and looking classless
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:26:45
Yes thanks for that would be cooler if the price was like actively moving but either way displaying the price I think is an overall good idea!
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:17:41
That is really awesome I am envisioning it! You're idea is kinda along the same lines my team was thinking 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:09:48
Oh that would be really neat do you know the name of the website?
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:19:29
Promoting the event helps build publicity and in turn helps raise money for charity
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:27:11
Well I guess everything is silly in the end :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:16:26
I like the idea behind it but most cars in this rally are also fully wrapped complete with sponsorship logos, Im afraid if it is too subtle it will go unnoticed among the other 200 supercars driving in this rally
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:58:21
Oh yes I see they have! Thanks for letting me know I will do that. Thank you it's a blast every year it's a very humbling opportunity to be apart of this brotherhood that's been built around this event. Thanks for your input I will repost 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:29:34
Oh that's pretty neat idea! I will need to do some research on how to implement a live feed :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:13:41
Okay great

Wow that is incredible thank you for your ideas! I love the idea at the checkpoints to gamify! This is very good stuff definitely going to run this by my team. 
And we always try to stay out of trouble anyway but even then ( not that it should happen of course)  I think a picture of the bitcoin car getting written a ticket might be worth catching ;) 
Thank you for your support! Truely appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:26:53
No problem thanks a lot I appreciate it! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:18:42
I know it, good taste! It's just a wrap though completely removes m. Wouldn't think about repainting her!
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:13:17
Hopefully next year lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:15:57
Limbo would be epic maybe next year
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:28:17
Yes that's a nice play on words! I like it 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:25:30
Thank you! I can't either! I am a woman by the way ;)
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:12:13
Wow very awesome. Part of the cannonball team is in London, i live near Monaco in France and partially in the USA as well. But we are starting the rally from London and have already imported a majority of the company cars to London this month
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:21:06
Cannonball team is littered all over, im dallas at the moment but I also stay in the south of France Half the year.  Have a shop in Indianapolis and London as well 
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:54:26
The link is in the comments I will edit the post and put it into there as well :) thank you 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:25:11
Starting grid is in London and ends in Monte Carlo, Monaco. I am a woman by the way ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:11:54
Yes I do like that! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:15:02
No problem happens all the time lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:18:28
Technically no, it's a sponsored event so every car has logos that is entered into the rally. The towns are all notified and worked with before arriving to provide proper execution when bringing 200 super cars into a small European town and we follow all the laws of every country visited. 
Participants get pulled over if they exceed the speed limit or break the laws of the road which isn't promoted by cannonball. Cannonball is a rally not a race! ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:40:44
Idk this made me laugh so hard! 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:19:31
The flames are actually very cool and similar to the cannonball Run logo!
