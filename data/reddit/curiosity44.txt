soo many people are blindly trusting the system, this could actually be a crash I will pull out if it gets close to the price I bought so I will limit the loss.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:01:08
the interesting thing that keeps happening to me is that people whom do not have any bitcoin and are against it are following it more closely than I am, every day they come to me and talk about the price and news and how it is the bubble. I am seeling now because I have to prevent any future loss and still have some profit but will buy back when I feel the market is stable again. I know I am part of the panic sell problem but I have to prevent any loss because I can not have any
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:34:56
How ? No one can see the future this could be the end or could be good.

Where is the roller coaster guy going down?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:27:40
I am selling some, already made some profit, from what I see it might hit one digit, still going to live the $ in exchange in case feels like the price is going up, be smart do not let the hype take over the better of you and think logically, holding is nice when the dip is 2% a day but right now is -41.4% in Month -19% day

Has anyone noticed how a few people talk about crypto and bitcoin these days? 2 weeks ago it was everywhere from taxi driver to news anchor were talking about bitcoin and crypto. But now it is like back in October only bitcoiners are still interested.
Maybe I am wrong ����‍♂️

There is a fee but it is important that you transfer

I secretly enjoying this because i can buy at dip and get make good profits but it is hard to know when to buy, i am like should i buy ? Nah wait 
Wait and like fuck yes glad didn’t buy but what about now ? And the cycle goes on and on

This seems super complicated to use on everyday bases, if bobs wants to work with 100 of different buyers he need 100 different safe in advance or what if he just want one time transaction? Maybe I didn’t understand but in visa i just swipes my card and walk away no planning a head 
But again maybe I didn’t fully understand the video 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:00:29
Is there any dip in future? 
 I know this is a million dollar question but as a student whom buy small one dollar save on the buy is one dollar 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:54:31
I understand what you are saying but i think it is good regardless, right now my parents and family knows about bitcoin but a few years ago nobody did 
If your hope is for bitcoin to take over you must prepare your self for these sort of hype being everywhere it shows people are noticing and when they do they hear more about it and it become more mainstream 
Once it is more mainstream it get more real world use and grow

@_date: 2018-05-18 17:05:56

@_date: 2018-05-18 17:07:20

@_date: 2018-05-18 17:41:21

@_date: 2017-11-17 04:26:16
investing in bitcoin was one of the best decision I made in my 20s 
wish had more to invest more 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:38:57
And yet my parent and my brother think it is a pyramid scheme... I personally made a few hundred bucks which is nice 
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:24:34
People invest base on community attitudes?
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:43:09
The drop has raped me too late
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:36:39
Yea it was when it hit 20k and was dropping, I thought to myself should sell before it hit 15k to maximize the profit, but never thought I would see this
it still hurt to lose money, men I really thought bitcoin would be the future, maybe we were all wrong maybe not, but one thing for sure this drop even if it bounces back damaged the bitcoin and whole crypto community.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:41:23
Maybe because some of us have no idea how to get started 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:24:52
