Oh we did, think about the gold standard. Didn't play out very well.

No, disinflation is fundamentally different. Rather than the decrease in price level, it is the decrease in the marginal increase of price level.

You can also get used to shrinking GDP then.

It's just stunning how many people have zero clue about basic economics (let it be mainstream or not), or just pure logic for that matter. If you are not proficient in a topic, please don't act like you are.

Thanks for the thoughtful conspiracy theory, but my question was regarding the technical implementation.

Discounting products will only change at nominal value, not at real. Nevertheless the overhoarding is the fear I have. Could have much worse effects than the recent crisis.

I sense some sarcasm, but please argue otherwise to help me understand your point of view

That's a fair point. My personal opinion is that Bitcoin in its current form will not be able to function as a primary currency. However the blockchain technology can prove invaluable in the future both within and beyond finance

Okay professor, then what would you suggest as a meaningful measure of value creation? :)
@_date: 2015-11-26 21:28:48
Would you care to elaborate? To my best knowledge there is a fix supply of Bitcoins (I recall around 21 millions), which is expected to be reached by 2040. And happens then? Most Bitcoin enthusiasts predict that it continues to increase in value, in other words it deflates.If you want Bitcoin to become the main currency, how it will be different than fiat money? Would you share your thoughts how it would effect GDP, investment levels, interest rates and unemployment levels?

That is true, and this is why we have (fiat or crypto) money, to quantify this. You are talking about personal utilities and you are right, but they are transferable. Without any offense I strongly recommend you taking some introductory microeconomics course (there a few very good MOOCs as well).
