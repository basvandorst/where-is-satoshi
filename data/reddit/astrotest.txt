Just looked up how to do that, seems plausible but they're saying to keep a backup because "You could import the private keys from your old client, but you will have to keep a backup of those keys separately as they won't become part of your Electrum seed." I don't know what this means? would it prevent the transfer from occurring?

Ooops, I know it's Bitcoins not bit coins. I have a bad habit of not proof reading.

So I've been doing some quick math and would like to double check with you guys because if I'm right this is going to suck. I'm currently at %72.80 sync and on average it seems to be 6 minutes for every %.01. So if i did my math right it will be like 11 days before I see my bitcoins?

okay I get the basics of what your saying. would you mind covering more in detail or point me towards the right guide or forum? I've got and installed Electrum and need to know where to go from here. When I install it it asks if I want to create a new wallet or restore from a seed. I assume I want to restore from a seed. where do I find the seed?

Internet is okay, it's a Sprint Hotspot. It's the only decent service where I live.

Wow you're awesome, got it all squared away now, and have the coins in my electrum wallet. I'm used to things being not user friendly, as long as there's a good community of people willing to give me a clear explanation of the process and help out I'm a happy and willing to learn. Thanks a million for your help.

Exactly what happened.

Just checked my blockchain (7 confirmations) and read a forum thread saying that I don't need to worry and just wait for my wallet to sync. That sound correct to you?
