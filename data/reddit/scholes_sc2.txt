Yeah it's better to enforce corruption, so bitcoin must be stopped.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:29:54
Yep. Right now bitcoin is pretty useless for smaller transactions/payments
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:22:28
I transfered a small amount of money. I used a small fee because i didnt want to lose 15% of my btc just in a transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:20:40
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:30:33
Wtf man your Tx hasnt been confirmed yet, mine is gonna take for ever!
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:20:33
Shit. Im also 29 and i quite a bit of btc around 2014. That year i discovered margin trading and how easy it was to start. At the beginning I tripled my btc stash within a few days and i thought it was just easy. I kept trading and luck ran out a few days later and started losing and losing btc. Eventually i lost it all. The first few days were really really hard, but I held on and eventually got better. Never fully recovered though.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:48:34
I made a transaction last month and its still unconfirmed. I dont understand, this is a big big issue, how come everyone is so bullish ignoring this shit?
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:04:51
Those are the fees I used a couple of years ago, i didn't know I now had to pay 10$ to make a 100$ transaction. Sadly, btc is unusable for small transactions like this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:41:10
Yeah our btc will be in a limbo for weeks
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:31:43
Tx was made using green address. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:26:45
I would like to just cancel the transaction. How can i do that?
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:59:48
Agreed but what if I want to buy something that's worth 10$? fees need to be percentage based.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:28:19
Its been over 3 weeks, the tx is still unconfirmed and i dont have aceess to my btc
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:34:24
Wow. This issue needs to be addressed
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:17:39
It's disabled. I would really like the transaction to get forgotten/cancelled.
@_date: 2018-09-03 15:12:39
Maybe it's one of those marriages where the husband makes the money but it's a beta and the wife controls every aspect of his life.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:22:37
I was just sending around 10$ worth of btc. The wallet wanted to take 3$ fee which I think It's a too much for a 10$ transaction so I lowered the fee. It said I was going to be ~3 hours, guess not.
@_date: 2018-09-20 16:00:39
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:55:32
I did a tx with 3 sat/b. Did we just lose our btc?
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:55:34
Do you think the app is rebroadcasting  the transaction or something?
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:16:25
Oh satoshi, busted by your mum.
@_date: 2018-09-19 20:57:18
I live in a country where power is almost free (if there is power)
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:45:42
Apparently you can raise the fee using a wallet called electrum bit i haven't tried it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:44:20
@_date: 2018-09-28 10:34:47
"give me your money on October and December"
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:28:05
Is there a way i can cancel the transaction? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:57:29
Which 3 words? bare with me, I'm a bit ignorant
@_date: 2018-05-19 13:41:44
Fuck my country in the ars
@_date: 2014-10-30 19:31:26
What happens after?
@_date: 2014-10-02 05:08:28
Hey thanks, don't know why i didn't though of that. I use a vpn service but i don't think i was connected at the time i tried to purchase. I've just checked and my normal &amp; vpn ips are ok.
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:45:07
At least he's being cool about it and having a cigarette
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:01:01
Same output. I already talked with the support team, they told me my account is not verified, but they mentioned a wrong number. Lets see what else they have to say
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:09:40
Did you also make the hand gesture he does?
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:27:44
lol sorry i didn't know about gamestop. Just checked out the website, i guess i just have to buy i gamestop card to fund my account and then buy the g play gift card on that page.
@_date: 2014-10-08 21:51:29
I think in Venezuela its lack of technical knowledge, or just mind set in general. Ive talked to everyone I can about btc but people usually end up thinking im just a geek playing with game money.
@_date: 2014-10-23 13:41:47
Low coffee levels are dangerous buddy.
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:57:10
Well for me it's the opposite. I can finally buy a little bit of btc. Buying btc it's kind of tough for me since my country's coin is so weak.
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:08:00
Shit i just better close my shorts and admit defeat :(
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:48:10
But it makes it easier to spy on everyone.
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:59:38
Satoshi made it dummy prof :)
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:35:29
It's like 98 percent in my country.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:20:59
I invested about six months of my salary when the price was 600 and not really worried, i still believe i made a good investment. Actually when my government allows me to buy more dollars, ill buy more btc.
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:30:00
Bittersweet feeling for me, cuz this means im gonna spend all my bitcoins :/
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:57:36
First step in the right direction.
@_date: 2014-08-29 13:52:13
Was so quick and easy, can't wait for the day ill be able to do everything with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:07:12
really is coinbase's support \^_\^ Thanks justin
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:10:17
For a journalist, attention is always good, doesn't matter if it's bad attention. I'm afraid she's gonna get away with it.
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:34:43
Well the posts about circle definitely seem like a marketing thing. I'm definitely not doing anything fishy, i just want to buy coins now that i can afford it. [Here]( is a link to on of the emails ive received.
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:59:17
And if you live in countries like mine, where governments are corrupt and oppressive and only allow you to spend 300$ a year with your credit card.
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:12:01
What rumor are you refering to? I though the current drop was due to he IRS thing.
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:48:16
Venezuela :(
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:45:43
Maybe when I travel to the us next summer hehe
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:51:33
I meant you were right about the surprise, which I'm guessing it's bull right?
@_date: 2014-11-13 00:20:23
Time for the chinese gentleman to shine.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:34:25
We might just have a bright future.
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:57:54
It says "0 of 6 confirmations" on my wallet. What could be the problem? I did a transfer to this address before.
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:01:12
In my case i use a linux vm on a linux host ;)
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:29:14
What exchange price is that?
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:35:31
What if i invested in worldcoin and now i dont have anything? TT
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:09:05
Lol, why? How old are you? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:27:14
Oh well, i guess this is better.
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:59:12
Oh god, I better start using protection then.
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:33:38
Well i did the math a few months ago and switched my gpus to scrypt
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:57:55
Yep something similar happened to me. They took like 3 days to cancel the order. I contacted them and they said it was the banks fault. I called the bank and they said it wasn't them. Went to circle.com created an account and a min later I had my bitcoins, amazing
gg coinbase
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:08:23
That's the sign, we've made it. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 13:53:14
All my purchases for the las 2 weeks have been cancelled. This never happened before for me.
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:31:30
ye i currently getting like 30% more coins, can almost feel like an early adopter lolz
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:27:50
Is this a really bad thing we should be worried about?
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:09:51
If a guy like op that clearly has over the average technical knowledge has problems like this, i can't imagine what would happen to my 54 year old father for example.
@_date: 2014-10-03 19:39:07
Hi forgive my ignorance, are you referring to the silkroad coins or something like that?
@_date: 2014-11-12 06:56:40
You called it too early. NOW everyone feels like that.
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:22:19
Hey that sounds cool. I know this isn't the right sub to ask this but, how can you make this? What languages would you use and that kind of stuff?
@_date: 2014-11-25 11:35:53
Theres a lot of shibes around here
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:36:58
Nah let me know when brazzers does.
@_date: 2014-07-18 11:16:14
Venezuela is actually one of the greatest and most beautiful countrys in the world but its been mislead for decades
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:23:55
I've missed this gif.
@_date: 2014-02-09 18:31:22
Apparently i didn't leave the wallet open long enough after i made the transaction. Now it's done. Thanks for taking the time to help me.
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:08:07
Haha dont need to be mean dude :)
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:18:44


Don't know why but this made me lol so hard.
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:22:25
That's for expending on the internet with your credit card, 300$. If you travel they allow the banks to sell you up to 3k$ depending on your destination. For example, if you go to the US, they only sell you up to 700$, YES, 700. And the situation is getting worse here in Venezuela.
Edit: 3k$
@_date: 2014-10-01 17:28:38
Well i bought 2 BTC a few months ago and about 0.3 about 2 months ago. Same bank account, same computer, nothing really changed. I guess I'll just have to wait for them to answer.
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:15:28
Being a millionaire seems fun... sigh 
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:59:25
I already have a mum dude, but thanks
@_date: 2014-08-13 17:16:16
I was gonna reply something like "dude i've heard that so many times!", didn't know about the inside joke part.
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:44:48
If they were into crypto, I think they'd be shibes.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:21:18
Shit man that was a bit confusing. Thank god im not american.
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:48:51
20? Make it 10!
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:05:51
Dont know man, i can see some sadness in his eyes.
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:42:01
This would be big for me, since getting $ is really hard in my country due to government regulatios
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:41:58
I live in south america. And the only dorian ive ever known is JD from scrubs. Every time you say dorian all i can think about its his silly face.
@_date: 2014-10-01 16:38:22
Well the comments about circle definitely look like advertising or something. Me? I just want to buy bitcoin now that i can afford it. [Here]( a screenshot of one of the mails I've received.
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:33:08
No luck for me, even though the overhead was debited from my savings account. Apparently the service of one account covering the other costs 35$ 
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:16:11
Ok but bitcoin still better than banks, period &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:38:56
Glad im not american :)
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:04:40
Is lightcoin a new crypto or are you refering to litecoin?
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:11:48
Thanks for the tip, I'll try that. I mean it was only for a day or so.
@_date: 2014-03-20 14:35:58
Ye dont tell many people you have btc in there.
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:15:44
Socialist utopia? More like corruption utopia :/
@_date: 2014-11-06 21:22:49
So this bull or bear?
@_date: 2014-06-12 16:21:22
And its less profitable than regular mining, dont know why so many people invest in this
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:18:32
It really does. Venezuela. You can buy $ cash on the black market but it's illegal and the price is almost 10 times higher. With the current black market $ price, i earn about 70$ a month :( i only earn about double minimum wage though.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:35:45
If can see the payment in my client within a few seconds, can i rest assured that the transaction was made? Or can something tricky happen and  then dissapear?
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:38:32
Were saving the world guys
@_date: 2014-10-27 18:20:58
370$ before nov 5 you heard it here first
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:51:39
I searched and barely found any similar cases. Thaks I'll check those out.
@_date: 2014-01-06 04:05:45
We are all happy nerds :)
@_date: 2014-11-12 05:47:21
He got it right, i hope you do too \^_\^
@_date: 2014-07-15 17:38:31
I saw a post about this a few days ago.
@_date: 2014-03-27 12:55:49
Also non-american here. I'm acutally pretty worried, this could be a major setback in overall BTC acceptance. The price might also suffer in the comming days.
@_date: 2014-06-21 21:07:40
We already can buy the bitches and the alcohol with bitcoin, the pool makes it complete.
@_date: 2014-10-29 20:21:30
qr codes could solve that and copy paste should solve that \^_\^
@_date: 2014-10-17 23:49:04
report this guy
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:00:05
Yet, coinbase is cancelling my purchases for some reason and circle is taking forever to link my account :(
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:22:35
An asian touch is a plus for me ;)
@_date: 2014-07-18 00:12:25
Came just short on the qualifiers. Hopefully next time.
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:44:30
Well I don't know, I haven't really met anyone in my city that owns bitcoin, and very very few even know about it. Also It's super hard for us to buy btc. The easiest way i found was buying amazon gift cards with the few pennies the government allows us to spend and then trading them here on reddit or localbitcoins.
I hope this surbitcoin thing takes off, Id really love to trade as much as i can of my bolivars for btc.
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:58:32
You know its great that more and more stores and services take btc but man, this is making me lose my coins faster and faster :/
@_date: 2014-04-10 22:47:38
is it still because of the china ban?
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:10:11
I invested when it was  still confident even though it dropped about 5% in the last few minutes to 338$.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:35:34
Well I've always kind of wanted to watch anime again, this is a sign.
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:51:17
Thanks for taking the time to help. How do i check that, i guess i need a transaction number or something, where can i find it. Using bitcoin-qt
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:06:55
ye btc too hard to mine for my 7950. Check your wallet address in the dogechain, and you pool balance of course.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:56:01
Why did the price drop again?
@_date: 2014-07-19 21:12:46
Sheldon Cooper did it first.
@_date: 2014-10-23 16:00:54
I had similar problem as op.
After about 3 days of waiting for my order to get cancelled, and 3 days for them to answer my mail, they said the bank was at fault. Then i contacted the bank and they said it wasn't them. Then i went to circle.com and less than 5min later i had my bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:04:01
But that was gonna happen either way.
@_date: 2014-02-08 21:20:32
How can i trade the gamestop giftcard for google play card?
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:50:40
Id buy turbo if they accepted btc or doge
@_date: 2014-08-29 12:55:18
Took out the third party item from my cart and the bitcoin option now appears -.-
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:34:16
I tried to do some btc/usd trading. I didn't knew shit but i gut lucky the first week and almost doubled my investment. Two weeks later i lost everything. I didn't knew what I was doing and it costed me. This  a dangerous ground for the newbies.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:30:34
Bu if we haven't reached the bottom yet, why not wait to invest when we're there?
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:08:37


Looks like you've not visited in a while.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:01:20


This is why clone research must be banned ASAP xD
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:40:49
OP said


So apparently he thinks this is not the true bottom. I might have misunderstood his comment, if so I apologize.
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:19:25
If you are new and don't have experience trading, I suggest you should stay away from trading, believe me :/
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:54:05
I'm from venezuela. Can confirm that very, very, very few people use btc down here
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:18:39
Id hate to be the guy that fucks up
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:25:54
If i could predict the price of btc i would be rich and the people who can predict the price wont share their secrets with strangers
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:41:40
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:56:16
The good old question
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:24:03
"Te meto el guevo en la jeta" (spanish word game)
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:34:04
1$/month? wow that's cheap. I'll definitely check that out.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:52:17
Yes they are my friend. I was just a saying. Although some people is more skilled and competent than others.
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:38:52
Yes. I earn twice times that and I can't do shit with that money. Can pay for internet though, which is good.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:42:27
I don't actually. It's just that people use a lot of sayings that mention god down here. I've been listening to them since I was a kid so they kind of have stick to me over time. But yea I believe things should be earned by handwork.
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:09:43
Ah yes my beautiful country, fucked up by corrupt politics.
You from Venezuela? How did you get your BTC in the first place?
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:14:45
Not many of my friends know english but I get your idea
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:10:06
A month dog, shit's pretty fucked up down here.
@_date: 2016-02-29 05:21:04
I hadn't thought about it before. Would the shipping fees kill me?
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:00:41
Yes I did about 3 years ago when i was super into the game. Actually haven't bought lotv.
@_date: 2016-02-29 05:55:33
I'm liking python a lot and django. Finished the tutorial that's on their webpage last week. Really need to work on my front end though.
So you're saying I should use the money I get from coding on hookers? ;)
@_date: 2016-02-29 15:48:38
I did mine litecoins and dogecoins about a year ago and yea electricity is kind of free down here. Problem is i could only afford 1 radeon 7950 and i had to use my personal desktop to mine. So I was doing very little coins and I couldn't use my computer like never. Also, internet and power is very unreliable here and I have at least 1hr of down time a day.
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:48:44
Thank but i was just curious. I cant really do gaming right now. Well maybe i could put my little brother to it. Thanks anyways. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 15:59:26
Cool I'll check it out. I can't do much coding right now. I'd say server side stuff is my thing but my front end is pretty much non existent, can only do basic bootstrap stuff.
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:02:34
Yes my thoughts exactly. Those politicians are there because of the people. Also, when you see how people behave around here you can tell why this country is so fucked up.
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:36:19
Yeah you're right. It's just that 100$ seem like a good amount of money to me right now, but I should ask for more than 0,24$/hr
@_date: 2016-02-29 18:07:22
I just did it in order to be able to fake my location so the major beer money sites accepted me. So I'm hoping it kind of pays for itself.
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:22:45
Forgive my ignorance, what is this?
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:02:24
Yes, used to play a lot actually. I thought about this when i read about gold farming. Where do people usually sell this accounts?
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:35:36
Wow cool. Are you freelancing or do you work for a company. What level of knowledge would you say i need to reach to earn around 20$/hour?
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:42:12
I mean I need to earn $ (paypal or btc) so i can trade that for bolivars. Don't have many bolivars since I have to spend almost everything I earn just to eat and services.
@_date: 2016-02-29 05:05:52
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:20:45
I actually have privateinternetaccess just for that but their IPs turned up to be blacklisted and sites recognize im using a vpn and most sites don't allow that
@_date: 2016-02-29 05:31:40
Yes that's why I'm trying to learn to code. If I manage to learn that and do freelancing I'll be rich even if i only make like 500$ a month. I already do IT related stuff so it seem like a good way to go.

Bueno piensa que al menos los cobres que invirtieron en el no se los pudieron robar.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:55:56
Yes and it feel weird if I spend all day playing games being 27 years old. I'd maybe set my 17yold brother to it :)
@_date: 2016-02-29 05:47:05
About 100$ working around 6 hours a day would be perfect. My goal is to improve my coding skills in order to earn more.
@_date: 2016-02-29 16:09:49
Indeed my friend, but it's a fact that some people are more competent than others. I'm not really religious I don't really care about it really, It's just that there's a lot of folk expressions down here that mention god and they have kind of stick to me.
@_date: 2016-02-29 05:59:34
I think I've heard about it. What games are good for farming?
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:49:01
Yes I've but very little sites work for my country. Made a few bucks on postloop though. Clickworker doesn't accept my country but I think I'm gonna sign up on sites like upwork and do translations since spanish is my native. Thanks for the suggestion!

Monthly. In Venezuela we always talk monthly salaries. Sometimes daily depending on the job but it's fairly unusual
@_date: 2016-02-29 04:17:40
Your friend is a smart cookie. I'm looking for ways to earn money online and trade for bolivars. If only god gave me a skill :/
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:55:42
I sounded that way, but it's just a saying. I'm actually not religious at all.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:17:23
I didn't give me any fee options sadly.
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:22:24
But they insist it is
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:52:52
Not everyone was so lucky
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:39:28
Hmm I see. Whats a good wallet for and android phone?
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:38:09
I'm using a .xyz domain, most of those are listed &lt;1$ on namecheap.
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:47:42
I don't think that was meant for this sub but it's still cool
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:14:53
Fuck 10k, I'm sad we won't see 9k vegeta memes again
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:07:05
Let's hope 9k is the new floor
@_date: 2015-03-19 12:50:44
 before it peaked to 1k. I held to them for a while but lost them a couple of months ago when i got greedy and started to leverage trade.
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:23:47
Missed this one, its been a while.
@_date: 2016-05-14 01:01:30
Pfft, i need 3 years.
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:09:44
Price. I even have alerts that wake me up in the morning.
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:47:41
Obviously I'm no expert but it's basically buying bitcoin when it's low price and selling when it's high, rinse and repeat, profit. Sounds easy in theory but if you don't know what your'e doing like me, you're gonna lose. This concept applies to other coins and stuff of course.
So, now I only recommend: invest amounts you're willing to lose and just hold!
@_date: 2016-05-02 23:20:24
Cool. I had about 9 coins back in the day, lost them all doing forex, fun times.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:32:09
I smell fear
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:59:40
That'd be cool, internet upload speed in my country are pretty slow so I usually can seed much. This would allow me to give a little back.
@_date: 2015-03-19 12:52:43
The things is that not everyone is good at recognizing when it's up and when its down.
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:46:11
That's sexy.
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:54:00
Yes but fees were ridiculous by then. I heard that something called the lighting network was supposed to solve this. Did this work?
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:24:09
But i mean trades with friends or maybe buy  a cup of coffee. Daily things
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:35:14
Indeed. Electrum is amazing. Thanks and forgive my ignorance
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:53:12
Someone told be it was because of the fee. I lowered the fee because it was too much money for the amount I was sending
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:58:29
Lighting sounds cool. Is it the new normal for doing small btc transfers? How are the fees? Whats a good tutorial?
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:10:10
Looks like it's not the best option to make quick trades like i intend to do
@_date: 2019-05-13 03:00:56
Electrum. Someone told me this one did and it does, all good. Fee is quite high for the amount of money I'm sending though
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:36:01
That sounds quite complicated. The average joe is not gonna be able to do that
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:40:06
Whats rbf? Yeah my delayed transaction was about 2 years ago using electrum wallet which is still my wallet
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:34:11
Is it easy to remove a transaction from the mempool? Don't want to know how, just if it's very easy for someone and how long does it take?
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:08:39


You mean like bitfinex?


What is this?
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:46:12
If i have my money in coinbase would the transfers be instant?
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:41:25
I think i set a very very low fee that one time. I didn't know the consequences
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:02:45
Well at least that sounds like a step in the right direction
@_date: 2019-05-11 12:52:43
Thanks, this is the kind of info i was looking for. Good to see there's still good people in this sub. I'm not a troll, just ignorant about the subject
@_date: 2019-05-10 20:59:04
My fee was too low
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:00:39
I made the same question when it was on 600, i decided to buy then.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:03:33
What are they basing on to cancel these transactions? The btc amount?
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:12:41
I just see this as an opportunity to buy more coins. I believe that  eventually btc or maybe other coin will change the world, for good of course
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:10:12
Damn i bought btc this week and they're supposed to arrive on tuesday, hope they don't cancel mine cuz I'd loose a significant amount (to me at least)
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:16:32
2k here we go
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:42:31
OMG thanks this really means a lot to me, you gosu
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:08:02
I live in venezuela. Having btc is like a crazy dream to me
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:40:58
Follow feeds like arstechia and stuff
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:02:49
That was cool, lets hope it becomes a regular thing in the E-sports scene.
@_date: 2013-12-06 22:39:07
BTC + greed gets you out of drugs
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:50:08
That is smarter than a LOT of people
