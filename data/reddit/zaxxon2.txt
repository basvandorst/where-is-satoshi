My suggestion is to write your Electrum seed on a piece of paper in pen/pencil and stash it somewhere safe, e.g., a safety deposit box if you have one. You should also memorize it. I don't suggest saving it digitally at all.

Made a purchase. Let's hope this inspires many more retailers to follow suit.

Thank YOU for the recommendation! :-)

LibreOffice is preinstalled in Ubuntu, and is accessible from the main taskbar. Just hover your mouse pointer over the icons until you find it. :)

I have always thought of "paper backup" as an umbrella term that might include paper wallets *or* seeds. Never paid that much attention to the semantics, but perhaps your usage is the more common one!
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:19:41
Very welcome!

Did you pay a transaction fee?
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:56:24
1. Good catch, I believe I mentioned the need to cancel in another place, but not there. Will update in next edition.
2. Very reasonable idea, will add a brief explanation. On my list.
3. This is true. I went with the older edition for the book to streamline the installation process and because I had some trouble with cross-platform transaction signing with newer versions. If you want to give it a shot, just (1) use the command I gave you to add the universe repository, and (2) follow the instructions on the Electrum site: 
4. Eh, it certainly can't hurt to disable autorun on the Windows side, but the risk of somehow infecting your USB drive while on Ubuntu is basically zero, especially if you just stick to my instructions. While no OS can be considered bulletproof, Ubuntu is about as close as it gets. I thought about including this step but just left it out for the sake of simplicity. But like I said, if you want to do it anyway, go for it, it won't make you any less safe...
5. Yep, you're right, instructions are unclear and I'll clarify.
6. If you create the Ubuntu drive on Windows (as opposed to Mac OS) it's possible to create a persistent drive, which means that data can be written and saved on the drive, rather than having it start fresh each time. This accomplishes what you want, but obviously nullifies a lot of the security procedures that involve rebooting to purposely get a fresh copy of Ubuntu, and is not recommended. Alternatively, it is possible to "bake them in" to the OS, which is probably what you mean, and yes would simplify the process. Of course, you'd have to trust the creator to not have introduced any malware. I thought about doing this, but I don't have the time or resources to host it and provide support. I don't know of any good linux distros that come with Electrum preinstalled at present, but if you research you might find something. Or, you could learn to do it yourself!
7. Your electrum seed is basically a super- private key. Each address in Electrum (seen under "receive" tab) consists of a public/private keypair. But every single one of those keypairs is mathematically derived from the seed. So the answer is that as long as you have your seed, you _already_ have all the private keys. And yes, as you know, you definitely should have your seed written down and locked up somewhere safe. Sounds like you just slightly misunderstood the concepts of keys/seeds, hopefully this helped.
Overall, GREAT questions and feedback. I really appreciate you taking the time to write to me. Make sure you sign up for the mailing list so you can get a copy of the 2nd edition when it comes out. 
Also, please tip me if I helped you: 1GA48WAYqgSeK5xebYrpmH4mgwYk45krjD

That is what I like to hear! Welcome!

Thanks for all the feedback, and I'm glad you enjoyed it!
Yeah... the target audience is people who are tech-savvy and could figure it all out by themselves, but want everything consolidated into one place. It ain't for Gramma.
I believe I did mention a couple times to split your stash into multiple wallets, but perhaps it's worth being more explicit about that in relation to BIP38 wallets. Making a note to do so in the next edition!
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:55:48
You are MOST welcome!

Odd. What kind of Mac do you have?
Also, Mac OS would be fine, if you want to go that route. The main reason for using Ubuntu is that it's free.
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:35:46
Sorry to hear it didn't hit the mark for you. To some degree, the technobabble can only be simplified, not entirely cut. Is there a specific point where I lost you?
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:22:38
That's really bizarre. My instructions come directly from Ubuntu.com: 
Hopefully OSX works out for you, but perhaps the Ubuntu support forum has some info on your specific issue if you ever decide to try it again.
Good point re: Terminal. It's now on my list and I'll make the edit for the next edition.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:32:00
You are correct! It's on my todo list for the next update. Good catch.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:17:23
You are welcome. I hope so as well!
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:44:11
Gotcha. I think it will all turn out OK - did you read Chapter 10? the tl;dr is that soon all of this will be replaced by simple USB Tamagotchi-like devices that totally eliminate the need for Ubuntu and a lot of the BS that you currently have to put up with for a high level of security. And these are only the upcoming generation. A few years down the road, this will all be unnecessary.

"Analogy" was a typo, you read it right the first time.

No problem!

Thank you!

You are welcome, sir! Enjoy!
@_date: 2013-12-22 00:05:24
Interesting, but I don't really agree that a paper backup == a seed as opposed to a private key, whether or not it's BIP38 encrypted. I think most people use the terms interchangeably. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:03:30
Thank you. Enjoy!
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:48:14
Thanks for the feedback. A few people have mentioned Armory so it's definitely on the table for the next time I update the book. As for the formatting, I completely agree. It's kind of a compromise I've grudgingly made though, because I release books on many platforms at once, each with their own formatting requirements. when performing all of these conversions, simplicity really saves me a lot of time. maybe someday I'll have someone to do all that crap for me.

Your best bet is to sign up for the mailing list. I'll send you free updates for the book when I have them and keep you appraised of any new projects.

Not that I'm aware of. Coinbase has some merchant tools and an API to control them, but it's a little different. You'd have to code the file delivery stuff yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:06:03
Looks like a lot of hard work. Thanks for your contribution!

Now approaching 800. WOW! And thanks very much to those who have tipped. Self-publishing is my full-time gig now, and since free shit is also great, donations make it all work out. Awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:31:30
This made me laugh out loud.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:16:12
I think the point was about managing risk, not retiring.
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:28:14
It's definitely on my list. If the book catches on, you can count on it.

All of the links without URLs are internal bookmarks, and all external links have URLs. Sorry about that. Maybe time to look into a new PDF reader, though, any PDF reader worth its salt should be able to handle bookmarks!
And yes ; -)

It's a service that lets you sell files for BTC. It doesn't interface with your wallet in any way -- it just gives you an address to send BTC to (which you do securely with your own client) and allows you to d/l the file when the payment is received. There are some similar services such as BTCfile and Coinlock, but I've found Satoshibox to be the best of the bunch.
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:24:38
Great to hear. Thanks for your business!
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:54:19
Yes, it's toasted. The best alternative I've found is Satoshibox. CoinLock is also viable, but I have had it skip payments to me. No bueno.
@_date: 2013-12-22 11:49:58
2,000 downloads today. That's NUTS! Remember, this will be going all day Sunday as well.
Please tip if you like the book. Self-publishing is my full-time job right now, and without food, water, and shelter, I will die.

Re: Armory -- the truth is I don't have much experience with Armory. I've always used Electrum and I wrote about it because I know it well. Someone else can answer that question much better than I can. 
As for paper wallets vs. paper backups, no real difference. In some cases, people MIGHT use "paper wallet" to denote nicely formatted backups such as those you can get from BitAddress.org, whereas a "paper backup" might just be a paper on which you scrawled your private key. But there's really no rule, and no major distinction.
I hope that helps. Hopefully someone can chime in about Armory. Enjoy the book!
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:29:58
It has the most features (editing box, redirecting, etc.), accepts payments the fastest, and pays out instantly. I've tested it extensively myself, and it's never failed to pay out right away, which is more than I can say of the others.
I am planning to email the developers to suggest a proof-of-purchase system. Obviously, if they're legit, it would be in their best interests. It would really distinguish them from the competition.
That all said, I do agree, there is always an element of uncertainty. But I haven't seen any evidence at all to suggest they're skimming off the top.
