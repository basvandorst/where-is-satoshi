AFAIK it can, it could be checked if a transaction was malleated (is non-canonical) and was included in the Blockchain. Never heard of anyone doing this, through.


Not really.


It was pretty much proved that this address was NOT from Gox.

This, ignore the rest of the comments. To expand a little bit, rumor has it that they are broke because someone exploited a software bug in their trading website during years to steal their balances. The total suspected loss amounts to about 6% of all Bitcoins in existence.
However, at this moment, it's still unclear and there are some "holes" in this rumour that mean that either they were pretty much doing zero accountancy, or that it's false.

In case anyone cares but doesn't understand Spanish:
- The article mostly blames the fault on MtGox and not on Bitcoin.
- Biggest exception is the malleability problem (dubbed as a "virus"), which the article kind-of implies is a problem with the whole of Bitcoin and not MtGox.
- Classic association of Bitcoin to libertarian, drug dealers and money launderers.

If you scroll through the pages, Blockchain recognizes some of the output addresses as belonging to legit services, so it's pretty unlikely it's a thief's wallet. Also why would someone stealing coins put them all through a single wallet?

So is Karpeles actually the cat or the card?

Not sure if I follow, but if someone malleated their cold storage transactions, wouldn't the only thing they could do is just change the txid, but the coins would still reach the hot wallet and be usable?
Also, while anything seems plausible ATM, I don't think someone would destroy their keys until the wallet was confirmed empty in the Blockchain.

Is this actually legit (the domain makes me somewhat think so)? Also, what's the actual backstory?

1: Put coins from wallet to thief's wallet
2: Open vault and put coins in your wallet
3: Put coins from wallet to thief's wallet
4: Open vault and put coins in your wallet
5: ... (Repeat for several years)
6: Notice wallet is empty.
7: Notice vault is empty.
8: Run away.
