I feel like these posts (as you know, there have been many before) conflate two issues: mental "overload" with decimal places, and making round numbers for the current $/BTC rate.  I would support something like an HTML microformat that makes BTC values on the web parseable so that individual users can tweak the display to whatever they like best.
But globally switching everything to mBTC today because we're close to a stable $1000/BTC seems like a bad choice.  When it moves big in either direction, we'll have these conversations about changing again.  Changing introduces confusion and mental complexity of its own.  For better or worse, a few services have already switched to mBTC, but I don't think it's possible to switch every last one.  We can't ban news articles from quoting $/BTC prices, so you'll never stamp out the idea.
I say what we have is close to good enough.  If people really care about the decimal counting issue (as far as making correct payment values, not inducing people to buy), then promote data exchange formats and software that can rewrite values to individual users' tastes.

Why do people always make up this imaginary world where everyday people buy coffee with BTC and verbally(!) transact values?  What, like 0.00732 mBTC is better?  Having to parse (either verbally or written) mBTC vs. uBTC depending on how expensive the thing is you're buying?
This world will either never happen, or will involve intermediaries and apps that transmit the value in units people are more familiar with, on a per-user basis, and the payor doesn't even enter a value, just authorizes the transaction.

You're jumping to conclusions just as fast as you accuse them of doing.  Assuming a couple of imgur links on Hacker News are correct, though:
Sure, it looks bad for them to be deceptive. But it goes to show how stupid the app review process is. If, by merely changing an external server that doesn't fall under App Store code signing policies, you can alter your app enough that it wouldn't have passed review and gets yanked, what is the point of the review? Did they even represent that the server would never change? Is that part of the agreement?
I'd guess the app was basically a Blockchain.info-only browser with some glue to scan QR codes and other minor system-integration stuff.  If anything, people are even more justified in being pissed with Apple for what amounts to, "OMG, you changed a webpage that our customers use on their devices, without our consent! BAN!"
I'm open to being corrected on this, as I'm not an expert about the App Store.

Here is something close, I think.  Party A is the "first signature" as you said (I'm assuming a client in a time-limited escrow), B is the other 2.  The 3 keys are exchanged.  "A" creates a transaction T1, which spends into the 2-of-3, but does not sign it yet.  "A" also creates a transaction T2 spending T1 back to himself, but with a suitable [lock_time]( (despite the name it can use block height too.)  "A" gives "B" the transactions and has them sign T2 if they agree (nobody broadcasts it yet though), then spends into T1.  Now 2-of-3 can spend the funds to wherever they want, invalidating T2.  (If "A" broadcasted T1 before getting a signed T2, he risks "B" refusing to sign a refund.)  If the time expires, "A" broadcasts T2 and receives the funds back.
If somebody wants to broadcast T2 early for some reason, then the funds are stuck in limbo until the lock time, when they return to "A."  (Maybe this is a feature depending on usecase.)  I'm not sure if there is a way around this.  "A" might be able to name some output in T2 that is not yet on the blockchain, and only release it when/if he wants to use T2.
I took some inspiration from [this section]( by gmaxwell.
Disclaimer: I'm not an expert.  There could very well be huge holes in this.  Let me know if you find flaws or improvements, though.

I looked into this for my account, and noticed that Coinbase seems to have auto-populated my public "Display Name" with my legal name that I intended to keep private (given for instant buy verification and/or KYC.)  I have fairly clear memories of leaving the optional name values unset (I think it was automatically set to "New User" at some point, and I didn't change it), but when I checked today, it had my legal name.  To be clear, I perceive this as Coinbase "publicizing" my name without me explicitly agreeing to it.
Now, there's a small chance I'm mis-remembering, it's not all that big of a deal considering other privacy precautions I take, and I changed my display name to something I'm comfortable with.  But do you know of any feature that would have caused this without me explicitly entering my legal name into the display name field?  If that's what happened, I'd prefer that Coinbase *not* work that way.
@_date: 2014-12-10 09:24:34
Thanks for the confirmation, and for working harder on these types of things in the future!  I can understand how it happened, if New User wasn't actually saved in the database.  I know my preference might be kind of unusual, and maybe I'm one of a few who even noticed this, so thanks for listening.  I haven't really used intra-Coinbase transfers yet, so I've had no need for a name other users could recognize me by, but preferred a generic name until then.  I've got it set appropriately now.  Thanks for your time and the tip!
@_date: 2014-12-09 11:29:05
Are you saying the display name defaulted to your legal name?
I signed up ~21 months ago.  There might not have even been a "display name" at all, then.  At a more recent point I noticed the name, which was set to "New User", and I left it.  Today the field seemed to be in a different place than I last remember it, and had my legal name (in another place, there was a "legal name" field and my other identity details.)  It's unlikely I would have put it there myself, because I don't usually go by my full legal name, and it's also unlikely that I would have elected to put my name into the field at all.
I guess in the course of database migrations, they may have accidentally mixed up the names. Or intentionally defaulted the display name to the legal name without much thought that some people won't like this, or that existing users might not even notice for weeks/months like my case.
@_date: 2014-12-09 12:27:09
My merchant profile is empty.  My legal name unexpectedly appeared under Settings -&gt; User Profile -&gt; Payment Page -&gt; Display Name.
I just created a second Coinbase account for a test. I used it to verify how my original account displays, by requesting money from its email address. Looks like I expect (the name is the value I set earlier today.) On creation of the new account, I was asked for my legal name, which became my initial "display name." I can tolerate this as the behavior for new accounts going forward, but am not happy that my existing account had its display name overwritten, without notice or consent as far as I can tell.
The most reasonable explanation I can come up with is that Coinbase assumed "New User" could be treated as if it had never been set, and the display name should be initialized as if it were a new account.  Well, IMO that was wrong -- it bothers me on a privacy level and simple control over my settings.  Not only was my legal name potentially exposed without my consent, but the system quietly changed a personal setting I was satisfied with.  It's one thing to set defaults on new accounts and expect users to look around and change them to their liking; but it's just rude to rewrite anything the user had a chance to change earlier but did not.  You should assume they didn't change it because they liked it how it was.
I hope I'm not assuming too much or misunderstanding something.  Coinbase reps can feel free to explain their rationale or correct any wrong statements.

My point about 8 places is that things get to ridiculous long numbers if you use all the places available to the current blockchain, e.g., $5 ~= 0.00607718 BTC.  I think that is one thing people are talking about when they say BTC would be unwieldy.  I guess an answer is to use mBTC with up to 2 decimal places, and it's flexible/close enough (but possibly only at today's price.)
As for gold, isn't there pretty much one canonical measurement for prices, the troy ounce?  They don't change it when the USD rate or whatever gets "too high."  That's why I'm saying it's silly to let that be your primary reason to change BTC units.
As for the American thing, it could well be.  This subreddit is quite American-centric anyway, though.
@_date: 2014-01-27 04:10:16
I don't think dollars and cents are comparable, because it's easy to work with two decimal places, and dollars only use 2 places or occasionally 3.  Bitcoin has 8 places, and you have to keep track of the places between BTC, mBTC, uBTC.  In my (American- and USD-centric) point of view, it just sounds like unnecessary complexity.
I'm saying coffee, etc., will probably still be denominated in fiat.  The coffee shop calculates how much BTC they want based on exchange rate, you tap your phone to their POS system to get payment info over NFC, your phone tells you what the USD price is based on exchange rate, you accept.
Alternatively, things are denominated in BTC and don't use the full decimal places possible.  In this scenario I could see m- or uBTC catching on more.  I would still think we're going to move to systems where the merchant POS system sets the price and the customer's wallet imports it, making verbal communication about values less necessary.
Can you imagine if the customer had to type the payment value in to the credit card terminal when paying by card?  I guess it didn't go that way because it's a "pull" from the customer's account to the merchant's, so the merchant sets the amount.  But even without that, it seems silly to verbally transmit information, and re-transmit by button-mashing, when there are computers that can do it faster and with less error.

Whitelisting is a good start, to throw out the chars the users have no legitimate need of.  However, if they want to allow non-English names (which I think they will and should), they will end up whitelisting accented Latin characters, which means they still need to detect that Çoinbase (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C WITH CEDILLA) looks too much like Coinbase.

Well, if they published a GPG or S/MIME key and you imported it into your client, you might get a green border or checkmark or something when it's authenticated as a known key, and warnings or neutral borders when it's not.

@_date: 2015-02-04 06:10:55


You've probably got a handle on it, but in case anyone else is curious, I found [this list of lookalike Unicode characters](  You can search "→ LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C" to see several things that could look like the C in Coinbase, but aren't.  For example (these may not display in your font), 𝙲 (MATHEMATICAL MONOSPACE CAPITAL C), or Ｃ(FULLWIDTH LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C).  I see the FULLWIDTH variant for several other characters, so I would assume it probably exists for all letters.  It can get really elaborate when you add in things like Cyrillic characters that look like Latin, or little accents on the Latin characters that might not be noticed.
Anyway, I don't envy the headaches of implementing checks for this, but thanks for the hard work preventing these issues!

Only if the email server of the receiver enforces DMARC, right?  Which, granted, so much of your userbase probably does, that it's almost not worth mentioning.  But if people are going to rely on that, they should know it's a function of their email provider, not yours.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:26:41
Ah, good point.  I thought of my own Postfix server, which doesn't enforce DMARC, but I do think it verifies DKIM and rejects outright on failure, or at least SpamAssassin gives it a higher spam score.  So, even if your server doesn't enforce DMARC, you should be pretty safe if it's following the best practices of even a few years ago.

Any update on this?  I worked on bitaddress's BIP38 code and would like to help fix this if there's an issue.  I just made a BIP38 "paper" (didn't print out) wallet with 3 addresses with the passphrase you gave, and after some initial trouble copy-pasting the rotated and line-wrapped private keys, was able to decrypt them all.
Do you have a key that doesn't work, or reproducible process that causes the error?  Are you using the same browser for creating and decrypting?  Might be worth it to check if the language and character-set settings are the same -- though BIP38 should attempt to support any combination.  What was your test process?
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:26:04
Hope not!  Here's some questions to try to understand what's going wrong:
1. Did you run tests of encrypting and decrypting a key before printing out?  If so, done anything differently from when you did that?
2. Are you using the same browser you encrypted with?  In theory it shouldn't matter, but there could be bugs exposed by using different browsers.  Specifically, browser type (Chrome, Firefox etc.), language settings, operating system.
3. Tried any other BIP38-supporting programs?  I think blockchain.info does.  I seem to recall one of the more obscure wallets having it in an upcoming release too.  There is also Casascius' [reference implementation](
4. Dumb question I know, but are you absolutely certain you're entering everything correctly?  I have sometimes had to enter my 24+-character passphrases 5 times before I got them right -- I probably fat-finger keys, transpose, or get the shift key in the wrong place.
Good luck, hope this helps.

I acknowledge your other reply about how we only know of **links** now (and not earth shattering ones as you put it), but I'm pretty sure if we don't already, we will have an actual image, and I can think of ways to embed it as a straight run of bytes instead of interrupted fragments (if that makes a difference as far as a "decoding required" argument.)  So, I consider this stuff on possession and intent to be relevant, or it will be, unless you have a good argument that an illegal jpeg in a field of a structured binary file will not count.
"knowingly possesses" sounds like it's not qualified further.  I found in the amendments on that PDF that "knowingly accesses with intent to view" was added at once, which sounds like "with intent to view" does not qualify "knowingly possesses."  I know this is contradicting your summary that intent to view must be proven, but I'm just going off what I'm reading (though I'm not a lawyer.)  I know the blockchain is a case in point, but what other justifiable reason could someone have to continue to knowingly possess, but not access with intent to view?  I just have a hard time believing legislators would actually have the nerve to leave a "loophole" like that, so I'm reading this as criminalizing continued knowing possession.
Do you think Bitcoin node operators fall under [this law]( ("Whoever, while engaged in providing an electronic communication service or a remote computing service to the public through a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce, obtains actual knowledge... of [CP]... must report")?  Luckily there's also, "Nothing in this section shall be construed to require an electronic communication service provider or a remote computing service provider to— (1) monitor any user, subscriber, or customer of that provider."
tor and filesharing may have some precedents on this.  I saw that somebody was charged with distribution for downloading and seeding CP on a filesharing network, but he had purposely downloaded it and even knew he was uploading to others.
So, if you could clarify "knowingly possesses" and whether "intent" is included that might put me at ease.  I think I'd just rather not look at the blockchain from now on to avoid the whole mess, but it'd be nice to get a little confirmation that nobody can get charged for possession (possibly knowing, or maybe rumored) as long as they don't access with intent.
Sorry if this is out of your scope or you don't want to be giving legal advice.

Freezes?  I worked on the scrypt code (turns passphrase into an encryption key) in bitaddress, and it should show a swirling "busy" indicator and grey out the page.  But I understand why you might still wonder if it was "frozen" even if the indicator is still moving.  Maybe I should look into a progress bar so you at least know about how long you'll have to wait.
For what it's worth, on recent browsers, 2 threads are used for scrypt, so if you have more than 1 core in your CPU, you are getting some speedup.  It would be interesting (and possible) to go higher, but the overhead of too many threads on less-powerful systems could end up making things slower.
And, if memory serves, Chrome is faster than Firefox for BIP38.

Darn.  I wanted to hack vanitygen's OpenCL core to crack this, and didn't have time yet.  Should be relatively simple, to feed it tens of thousands of words SHA256'd once, have each iteration do another SHA256 and address derivation.  Leave the vanity address comparison logic and just put in the bounty address as the desired "vanity address."  It would of course be highly targeted to your bounty (not good for scanning the whole network as the brainwallet-stealing bots do, and probably not with a very large dictionary), but I would expect it could find it in a few hours on a decent GPU.
I still might do it, but without a bounty it will go lower on the list.

2. Open in Armory.
3. Wallet Properties -&gt; Backup Individual Keys
4. Copy Root Key and Chain Code to clipboard
5. Delete Wallet (otherwise when you try to import it will say you already have that wallet)
6. Import Wallet from Paper Backup, enter root key and chain code from before. Accept whatever ID it says.
7. Allow the rescan and see if your balance is recovered
This worked for me to get the same sequence of receiving addresses from before I truncated the file, but I assume it has the private keys.

True, I neglected that.  The relaying problem does complicate things, but if people are serious about this we can build some relaying protocols on top to get small txs straight to miners who will accept them.  This already happens with [current non-standard transactions](  Eligius and whoever else mines them might continue mining microtransactions.


Hmm.  Reading about transaction priority at  makes me think a bunch of tiny outputs will drive up the tx size (denominator) while barely touching the numerator, meaning the priority goes down so that the size-based fee kicks in and probably more-than wipes out the values of the small outputs.  It may not be as bad as I think, but in any case it sounds like small outputs may have to be spent with care to be economical.  This is not user-friendly, which is why I think we're better off strongly discouraging such outputs for now.  At least I trust the developers to understand this a lot better than I do and that they have made the decision for this reason or something similar.  If I distrusted or disagreed, I'd be finding ways to do these transactions anyway.

I feel a little bad hijacking OP's thread, but this caught my eye and it sounds like OP will have some other work.  I think it can be done as follows, and I would do it for 0.7 BTC.  The images would be stored locally, so you would have to re-add them if you changed browsers/computers or cleared your browser storage.  There will probably be a browser limit on how large (in file size) the images could be, but I think it would allow for several well-compressed images of good resolution.  It would require a somewhat recent browser, probably within the last year for Chrome/Firefox and at least IE9, maybe IE10.
I can't guarantee that bitaddress.org would accept the modifications, but I can (and would prefer to) make it open source and offer to them, and you could download &amp; use my version.  If they won't accept it, I could integrate their new feature releases into mine for a period of time if you'd like.

I agree with your points here, basically.  I know the default client is influential and think not many people will go against the inertia of default settings.  Pool operators are (or should be) a lot more knowledgeable and mindful of this, though, which means the policy will basically be dictated by them (possibly with input from their users.)  I suspect if there is any significant amount of support behind the idea of still allowing small transactions, pools will be advertising their support for it and their fee rates.  I feel like the only people who care are a vocal minority though. If that's the case, Gavin and Co. are well within their place to make this decision.

I tried deliberately corrupting my wallet to see what would happen, and in some cases Armory wouldn't even start -- is that what's happening for you, or something else?
It looks like Armory wallets are deterministic, meaning as long as the "seed" is intact and you didn't import private keys from elsewhere, you should be able to recreate the wallet and have access to your coins.

As long as you offer access to the source, I think it's fine.  Red Hat et al have been selling GNU/Linux for years.

First off, my experience is mostly with Android 2.3/CyanogenMod 7, which has been very stable for me and meets my needs well enough.  I just recently rigged up an rsync script to easily back up my phone's filesystem to my workstation.  I was pleasantly surprised to find rsync was already included, and was even able to run in daemon mode to have the workstation "pull" the files over.


On Android, replace with "available in busybox" or on [BotBrew]( (though I admittedly haven't tried the latter, it looks like it would meet this need.)


I think you do have a point here, but a chroot or BotBrew should bring you all the standard libs.  It would just be a little more work to copy them onto your workstation for the linker.  I don't think there's a logical reason chroot would cause a speed hit; this [Stack Exchange answer]( says so, FWIW.  As for resource requirements, it should only be a few more kilobytes to create a standard /dev filesystem.


If you've got source for your Android kernel (which is legally required since it's GPL), you should be able to build any modules you would want and configure them, possibly having to be done outside of the chroot but usable within.  Again, I'm curious what kernel-level tinkering you're regularly doing on your iPhone?  I'm skeptical, but really do want to learn about what people do with the iOS kernel.  I know people have used the cifs Linux module to be able to mount SMB network shares on their Android devices.


So, your argument seems to be "Jailbroken iOS, plus Cydia apps, plus my own custom-built cross-compiled Linux tools, is superior to stock rooted Android."  That's not a fair comparison.  It sounds like approximately equal effort is required to get a working UNIX platform out of either OS.  Depending on how picky you are and what your needs are, maybe a little more is needed for Android.
Frankly I find it hard to imagine you regularly pecking at your 4" terminal emulator with touchscreen keyboard (you didn't mention a hard keyboard), wget'ing a file and piping it through sed and awk, then opening it up in emacs/vim for some editing before mailing it off with pine.  Maybe you open a remote shell at a bigger terminal for heavier work?  Like I said, I'm going to be occasionally running an rsync server on my phone, which is pretty obscure, so to each his own I guess.  Sorry for the wall of text.

Hmm, so they've either changed or Voorhees' statement is misleading.  If they're only at 1 satoshi, this does represent a 5000-fold increase -- but since 1 satoshi is several magnitudes below a penny (USD) I really don't think this is some great hardship for them.  They're using a volunteer payment network to distribute a message to the whole world about a gambling loss for one person -- sounds pretty fair that they should have to pay an extra half a penny for the privilege of using everyone's internet connections and hard drives for it, when the financial meaning of that transaction is almost nothing.
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:57:14


And you know what code they do or don't run is also up to them?  You know Gavin doesn't have a backdoor to forcefully update everyone's code?  So they do in fact get to control their price, regardless of what the defaults are or what percentage of miners actually change them.
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:33:46


Funny, you were [just citing]( compiling your own Linux tools as a plus for iOS, but suddenly it's a downside on Android.  Yes, you're saying that the standard tools "just work" as-is, and you only had to compile the more obscure ones, but this still strikes me as hypocritical.


I asked because I suspected you didn't really have all that sophisticated of needs.  You either really do or are really committed to inventing reasons why having UNIX in your pocket is important*.  I guess since I've never run dhcpd on either OS there's no value in arguing further.  I would still rather have (most of) the source code to make my own Android how I need it, than a largely closed-source iOS built by control freaks that can be jailbroken in order to meet the needs of the 0.0001% of users who need to run dhcpd on their phone.  I'm glad it works for you, but I'm also confident if I needed that on Android, or the full versions of any other busybox utilities, I could get them.
*Yes, I was kind of arguing along these lines too, but it was more that I believe it can be done on Android, not that it's important to me or a selling point.

Oh, like where miners in favor signal by doing something in their blocks, and those against do the opposite?  Like, the ones in favor could exclude really small transactions, and the ones opposed could include them.  Hmm, what threshold?  Let's use 5430 satoshi for simplicity, since that is the amount in this change.
This is exactly what will start happening, now.  Pools will update/re-patch their code and configure their settings.  The "winners" of the vote will have their way, without Gavin having to do anything further.  There is no danger of a fork, because microtransactions will still be accepted by everyone if they are mined into a block.
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:35:44


Btw, isn't 10^-8 (one satoshi) an arbitrary limit too?  Sounds like you should be complaining about finite values in general, not which divisibility factor it is.

Really cool, it's amazing you got all the necessary functions into the size constraints.  Those libs might be useful for others' Arduino bitcoin applications, too.
And if anyone is wondering, I was able to snap the private key (no funds were actually sent), so be careful when making videos like this. :)
@_date: 2013-05-07 06:08:51


5430 satoshis hovers around half a penny these days, depending on the price, so it could still be possible.  They could also pay a whole penny and get the change back in Congolese francs.
This is all assuming DR Congo is going to adopt Bitcoin for everyday transactions mediated by the blockchain.  I don't know why somebody so poor would conduct transactions in a volatile commodity that is probably even less stable in value than their own currency.

"Protocol" didn't necessarily have to mean a strict network communication standard, just a mechanism by which node operators can communicate their preferences and work together.  The "free relay policy" wiki page I linked is part of an example.  We might also add some code to the client to allow the user to manually specify rules for routing certain types of txn, without having to make a full-blown protocol.  I don't know, that sounds kind of dirty, but I'm just saying there are still choices no matter what is made "non-standard."


Perhaps.  But until such a better solution is implemented, tiny outputs will continue to clutter the UTXO set, taking up resources for little gain, as they will not be spent.  It could take months before adoption was high enough that new input-choosing algorithms would be effective (or for dust to "age" sufficiently in the current regime), and then maybe a few more months to trickle into all the alternate clients.  In the meantime, the UTXO set would continue bloating with dust.  Or, we can just effectively ban the creation of more dust for now and buy some time to do all the above.  At sub-cent (USD) levels, I really don't see why some people think this is some huge hardship.  (And the developers have expressed willingness to adjust if the price skyrockets; not to mention, as an open-source distributed project everyone has the tools to adjust it themselves.)  Bitcoin has in the past been billed as a micropayment (some are saying these are more like "picopayments") solution, but it currently just doesn't hold up well under such uses, so it's time to set that idea aside, at least for awhile.
I'm at least glad you acknowledge it's a hard problem.  I'm not convinced this is a perfect solution either, though I tend to trust the developers.  Some people seem to think the developers do nothing other than collect salary from the Foundation and use the client as a platform to spread their prejudices (against gambling, for example.)

Agreed, even fifth graders might be interested to know "base 2 is used by computers" or "large bases make it possible to write large numbers with fewer digits."

He mentions it casually at the end, clearly labeling it a "parody site" where his readers can see more "ridiculous looking computers."
"Ridiculous" is a bit of a negative word, but I have no problems with viewing the typical mining rig as "ridiculous"; they're usually not pretty and even cut some corners to just meet a minimum standard of functionality.  We call it "mining rig porn", he calls it "pictures of ridiculous-looking computers," is there really that large of a difference?

Dunno, whatever people do at other local meetups.  Maybe a hackathon -- I've been interested in [Casascius' point of sale proposal]( but haven't put any time into it.  If he brought some terminals to hack on and other interested people were there I might dedicate some time.
Or like chazay said, buy stuff.  :P Apparently SLC's [Firehouse BBQ takes bitcoin](

That is also bugging me so badly for some reason.  Everyone and their dog thinks there's a supported feature for embedding messages.  I guess I'll blame all the pranks that have encoded stuff and blockchain.info's "public notes" that use the word "embed" as if it's going into the chain.
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:25:19
P.S.:  I did gloss over "knowing", but I'd like to hear any answers about that.  If you read a post from a guy like OREWebfoots where he presents credentials and states his professional opinion that a certain tx is CP, are you now in knowing possession?  Maybe someone posts a link to a list of hashes of known CP files (I think these exist, although maybe not public), and a verifiable and simple extraction method that produces one of those hashes?  Do you have to make a visual representation extracted from the blockchain and look at it yourself to "know"?  (no way I'm ever doing that.)

You act like it's the worst thing in the world that you would have to compile _anything_ for Android, but have no problem saying you've had to compile _some_ things for iOS.  I'm sure that's not how you see it, but that's my perception of why it's hypocritical.
And yeah, the NDK may be harder to work than Xcode or whatever, but I think if you looked harder you could find acceptable Android implementations of the same stuff you appreciate iOS for having, and not have to compile yourself.  I can't be sure because like I said I haven't really done it myself, but I wouldn't know if they met your needs anyway.


OK, but just having a browser surpasses that expectation.  Throw in an SSH client and you can do anything the remote system can.  Yes, those both need a network connection, but all the tools you wanted were network tools anyway.  (I do see how running them on a local wifi network could be useful, which can't necessarily be done with a remote SSH server.)

abe is probably good.  Altnernatively, [blockparser]( especially the commands to dump out all data into a format like CSV or SQL that you can then analyze however you like.
Nitpick you may understand but just misspoke on: you can't know "current wallet balance"; a wallet has an arbitrary collection of addresses that can't be reliably linked by outside observers.  You can watch for spends from, say, two addresses in one transaction, and assume the same person owns both, but even that is not perfect as it is possible for two parties to sign for their own addresses without one person holding both keys.
