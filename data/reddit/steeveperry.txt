I’m sure Donald trump and Donald trump only is the guy who wrote that tweet. I’m sure Donald is very well bigly educated in crypto.

Coins are awarded for mining a block. Computers mine blocks. Computers don’t have a race.

Nature stopped (or has at least taken a lesser factor) selecting who lives, dies, and reproduces a while ago. When someone’s genetically inferior-ass gets bailed out because their rich parents have access to superior medical treatment, that ain’t nature deciding you get to pass you get to live and pass your genes on. 
When that genetically inferior fella has access to a larger pool of mates because he’s rich, nature ain’t selecting. 
Money isn’t rewarded because of better genes.

Totally not bitcoin noob here. Outside of having a full bitcoin is more than having not a full bitcoin, is there a benefit to owning a whole coin? Asking for a friend.

Where did I say that I want to centralize currency exchanges?
Edit: i'll just assume you're talking about the last bit on socialism. Socialism doesn't require a centralized money exchange or a strong central government. It's about democratizing the enterprise, and distributing the decisions an organization makes to labor as a whole. Instead of 25 board members deciding to outsource a department, or to move the company, or dishing more money to shareholders/executives while the rest of the workers get nothing, everyone in the organization would have a say. It actually decentralizes power (instead of a few making a decision that affects many, many make a decision that affects many.)

My mistake. I'm still having trouble understanding what you are trying to say.
I don't think a centralized authority usually yields good results for all. I guess that's what draws me to bitcoin--no one central authority controls it. For that same reason, I like some of the ideas laid out in socialism where it relates to decentralizing corporate power structures--no one person (or small group) controls it.
I guess I don't understand is, what centralized authority do you think I am pointing to in regards to how it is exchanged?  
Edit: fixed the question

Schiff got the mortgage thing right, and that's about it. Gold didn't hit 5k (and is 1/3 the value of bitcoin) and the credit card industry didn't suffer the same fate as the housing market.  
Peter Schiff thinks things like "the minimum wage is bad for unskilled workers because who would give them a job if they couldn't pay them 2 dollars an hour. The minimum wage hurts unskilled labor more than millionaires and billionaires. Where else will these workers learn basic skills like showing up and talking to people" (even though millionaires and billionaires are the ones driving for a push to eliminate a minimum wage---but I guess it's normal for folks to undertake massive lobbying campaigns to prevent things that don't hurt them).
Another great take is "people shouldn't start a family if they make minimum wage", as if human biology is influenced by financial standing (you'd want to fuck that hot blonde girl much more if you made six figures--but you make $8/hr, so your hormones will function differently!). 
Oh, and Schiff LOVES to talk about socialism. I mean, he couldn't explain to you what socialism is (to Schiff, anything that the government does that he doesn't like is socialism). On JRE, I think he just said socialism is a mixture of communism and fascism... (And you know what, think what you want about socialism, but at least derive those ideas with the understanding that socialism promotes the democratization of industry, not hrrrrrdurrr free shit for everyone.)

Ah yes, the old "gain 10 percent in value in 20 minutes". This is the kind of volatility I can get behind.
