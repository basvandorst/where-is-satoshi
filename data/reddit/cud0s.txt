Well after this sharp increase in price and media attention a lot of people noticed bitcoin but not many of them know what it really is and how it is better than fiat. Majority just think it's a quick way to get rich and only want to speculate (of course it's just what I have seen). However if bitcoin was accepted in more places there surely would be people willing to use it because it seems that we like (affordable) tech innovations especially those which can save money. If I'm not mistaken Lithuania was one of the first countries to offer 4g internet with a good coverage, also there was a lot of excitement about nfc therefore in many places you can pay using it and we have one of the fastest internet in the world. Obviously these are just a few examples and I'm sure you could find something opposing that but I think it shows that lithuanians aren't afraid of new technology therefore bitcoin can become popular here. Also in my opinion bitcoin has even more advantages for poorer counties than for the economically strongest.

Suppose it's true why would he post this? Yeah sure some would notice some weird activity but still no one would be sure what happened.

Yeah almost same for me. But still it was profitable

Have you done even a little research into it?
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:14:45
Yes and now bitcoin has much more real world value

Ppc have risen 10x compared to bitcoin in a short time. It has some good features bitcoin is lacking so not every coin is a complete and useless ripoff

Looking at history of space exploration it is going to take a looong time.

Russia-maybe, Ukraine-definitely no.

Btc isn't a stock and I believe nyse is a stock exchange

Well that's what you(and me) get for making stupid decisions. You should either go long term with a little of trading knowledge or trade more often with good trading knowhow. I mined 1+ bitcoin back in 2011. Now I have 0.5 because of stupid impulse decisions

I think people realize this and all this crazy optimism is just for lulz :)

Let's say 51(30)% attack happens or sha-256 is cracked then we still have alternative currencies therefore I think it's good to have an alternative. And average Joe isn't likely to get into them instead of bitcoin

Stupid move and even more stupid to ask for advice here.
