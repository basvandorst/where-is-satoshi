Mining on ARM Boards has never been a thing.
If you somehow got bitcoind compiled to run on a mini2440 in 2009, It would still probably not be profitable.

I'm assuming the 5.xx.xx.205 is not your IP, but a IP you connected to? So that would mean a machine on your network is using 39394 (could be your Bitcoin node) and is receiving data from another real or fake node.
If you have logs with ip addresses enabled I would check to see what the full IP address of 5.xx.xx.205 is. Perhaps it's a known IP that botnets connect to often.
If you have a router, have you checked to see if anyone else have been connecting to it and the firmware is up-to-date?

I don't have any mathematical reasons behind it, just a number I came up with. I think it makes more sense to set -blockmaxsize to something much smaller than 20MB till a few years down the road when we need it.
I have read part of your Analysis &amp; graphs of block sizes reddit post and comments on github about 400k being the ideal soft limit. I just don't see enough reasons to set the limit that low. 
How do you feel about increasing the block size every year till it reaches 20MB (Eg. Increase 2MB every 52,500 blocks) or would a set limit be more ideal?

If it's done for good, the site lasted a lot longer then I thought it would. Maybe their payment system is just down .
I "invested" 0.17 BTC back in June of 2014 for a 50 GH 5 year contract. My last payment I received was on June 7th. 
I remember in the early days of the site they said they used multiple pools but couldn't say which one and they would soon post their hash rate on the site. I remember posting on Bitcointalk that they sent me the same about of BTC each payment. Can't seem to find that post now.

I have used and recommended Mycelium, Breadwallet and Jaxx.
Download all 3 and see what ones you like best.
In my opinion,
Jaxx: Is not the best at fixes security issues fast. Sometimes service goes down. Has a nice UI. Windows, Linux, Mac support.
Breadwallet: UI is a little confusing to me. Has better iPhone support than Android.
Mycelium: Has a nice UI. Has better Android support than iPhone. Not many updates. Service goes down sometimes.

In my opinion Ethereum is being used as an pump n dump coin. I seen many local Bitcoin traders buy this coin on the news of some kind of feature then they plan to sell later. Almost all Ethereum users I know do not plan to hold the coin for long term use.
While I believe most pump n dump coins are pyramid schemes(Eg. Golem, PIVX, Iconomi... Again in my opinion only, do your own research) I do not think Ethereum is a scam. 
I put Ethereum is the same category as Namecoin.
As Ethereum has way more development than Namecoin, I can see how it would have a higher price. Do I think 1 Ethereum is worth 0.1 BTC (price as I'm writing this post) I would say no.

If you are running bitcoind, use getpeerinfo and look for a high bytessent or if you run the GUI client open up debug windows and click the peers tab.
To ban a peer type in "setban 54.72.0.0/16 add 18000000" into the console.
That will ban any IP address that starts with 54.72 for about 7 months.
Eg. To ban any IP address that begins with 52 you would type setban 52.0.0.0/8 add 18000000
