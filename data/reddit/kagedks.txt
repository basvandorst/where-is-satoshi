Well I don't know your situation or anything obviously, but no matter where it bottoms out at this point, wherever you told yourself you wanted to buy in... it will definitely be worth it, this thing is far from being over. I don't plan on making any big swings, but the longer they drag this battle out the better because it affords opportunity far more often along the way.

I will say it is fun though, depending on your intentions and/or expectations. 
It is also just a really exciting thing to be a part of because the more you understand it, the more you realize how close the future is.

there isn't necessarily a drought of things to read even just through a google search. There is a lot of bullshit you have to sift through though.
 is one you'll want to have in your pocket.

this one was good
expanding further on what can be done with this technology this kind of made my brain leak out of my ear.
