The periodic loss of wealth invested in Bitcoin through hacks will not be tolerated forever. Unless the system can come to terms with this problem Bitcoin has no future as universally held asset. 
I forsee in the not to distant future a hard fork which will result in two kinds of Bitcoins, one that is traceable and can be embargoed in the case of theft and the original bitcoin, similar to what is going on with Ethereum.

Bitcoin and ether have the capability to solve these kinds of trust problems. The fact that bitfinex did not crytographically link tether to dollar deposits with a smart contract tells me that they are up to something fishy. 
Having a trust problem with a bitcoin business is totally inexcusable.

When someone wants to cash out their bitcoin on bitfinex they are paid in tether. What happens when they want real cash?

 It is known by AT&amp;T and the whole world that a stolen phone identity can wreak financial and personal havoc on the victim. Allowing a phone number transfer without even bothering to contact the current owner for permission is beyond stupid and shows that AT&amp;T was willing to trade a few harmed customers for the lower costs of inadequate security. The judge should triple the damages sought.

At least contacting the victim would be a good start. The negligence of AT&amp;T is so egregious as to look almost intentional. The company is lucky some of its employees will not be getting jail time.

It's about time someone called out AT&amp;T on their negligence. It was far too easy for a hacker to convince a $2.00/hr call center employee in the Phillipines to transfer any AT&amp;T phone to another carrier and along with it the two-factor authentication of the bitcoin wallets linked to the phone. 
AT&amp;T has since required a PIN to transfer a phone number to another carrier. But if the hacker has a good enough sob story the PIN requirement will probably be waived which should set AT&amp;T up for another $200 million liability. LOL

I have used Coinbase since they started and have 60 BTC in their cold storage. I do all my buying on GDAX since MtGox failed. Though to be totally safe I distribute some coins on blockchain.info and in a wallet on my desktop. I learned from Gox that you don't want a single point of failure to put you out of the game.
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:00:10
You didn't lose all of it. At the current price of bitcoin-- $1000 you would get back 1/2 the value of your lost bitcoins on MtGox which are valued at $450/btc. If bitcoin goes up another $900 you would break even. Of course you would miss the opportunity to have your MtGox bitcoins quadruple in value from their $450 price when MtGox blew up. 
The solution to the opportunity loss on MtGox was to immediately replace the lost coins with new ones.

I was not aware that the judiciary had their own intelligence service that would allow them to nit-pick the president's security assessments. The president is privy to information others don't have. That is why he is given executive authority. 
Besides the case was not about the constitutional merits of the president's order but about whether the action could be temporarily enjoined until the order was reviewed. A court putting the temporary inconvenience of 100 green-card holders ahead of the physical security of the entire nation is bizaar and again does not pass a smell test for those courts involved having been politically corrupted.

The total value of accepted claims = 45,609,593,503 Yen = $402,975,810
Total assets of MtGox bankruptcy trust = 202,185 BTC 
$402,975,810/202,185 = $1,993 $/BTC
Value of Bitcoin required to satisfy claims at full value = $1,993 $/BTC.
So you would receive the full value of your lost MtGox coins at the price they were when MtGox died ($435) when the current price of Bitcoin reaches $1900 which is about $900 from now.

Bitcoin's value derives from its scarcity as the only unit of account of the blockchain public ledger. If you want to replace third party trust entities like brokers and notaries with the blockchain you will have to use bitcoin to put an immutable transaction on it. This is why the smart money is investing and the haters are getting left behind.

Did you have two factor authentication linked with another device like your phone?
Did you use the same password to login to [blockchain.info]( as your email password?
The only way the attacker could have known your [blockchain.info]( wallet ID is from reading your email so if he has your email password he also would have your wallet password.

A good example of a crytpo-coin Ponzi scheme by your definition is OneCoin where the perpetrators periodically set the value of the coin to make the early adopters' stake seem like it's increasing in value and the new suckers all think the price is mysteriously set by mining OneCoin.

The price manipulators are the market makers which you really need to have liquidity in the market. Without large numbers of bitcoins changing hands constantly volatility increases. 
Long term investors should not be worried about price manipulation since wild price swings are invisible in the long term. An investor should put in an order at the current market price for the number of bitcoin they want and forget about it. Or they can have some fun and wait for a price manipulation dump and buy at the bottom.

Coinlab knows it will lose all of its appeals but hopes that the MtGox trustee and creditors will pay him to go away with a fractional settlement.
