Well, technically, your bitcoins are on a set of addresses (wallet) generated by your ledger. Those addresses are generated on the demand of the software you use (also wallet) in a specific format. You have to generate a new software wallet with segwit and transfert your funds.
Exemple with Electrum ([ :
\- plug-in your ledger
\- launch electrum
\-  generate a new wallet, with hardware device, on "legacy format"  :  you should see your actual funds
\-  generate a new wallet, with hardware device, on "segwit/bech32 format" : you now have a second wallet, with adresses stating with 3...
\- transfer the funds from the first to the second
\- profits !

Normal scenario :  
I own .05 BTC to a friend, I sent it for 5sat/bit and he received it in about an hour.
no exchange or currency involved, no crap with conbase or anything.
I mean, Just replace bitcoin in his complaint with any other currency (yen, euro, pound, whatever) and you will understand the fallacy directly. LMDIFY :  
English pound are great
I bought 300$ on an exchange with my debit card and costs me 11.51$
Sent to a friend, the exchange blocke the payment for 72 hours. rate changed and cost us 50$
Friend received 250$, but is unbanked so he got fiat in cash wich cost him 50$ he received 200$
The whole process of using pounds and going through 3 paying steps (exchange, sending, exchange &amp; withdraw) is just ridiculous.

Well, think of the people HODLing some money on non-segwit adresses : as long as they don't want to move their BTC  or try new fancy tech (ligntning, etc...) , they are better off leaving their money on the legacy-format addresses.  
... and when they will need to move, it will cost less satoshis (because moon) and maybe some new fancy address types will be there anyway, jumping right into the future, skipping the segwit address.

ELI5 : 
when you do a transaction, it goes it the mempool, waiting to be confirmed ( by the miners ). The miners choose which transaction get picked up. 
Some miners "spam" this pool, creating huge amounts of transactions to slow down the confirmation process, pushing people to put high fees on their transactions (which miners and altcoins benefit from)

the costs of transactions are a free market. it just depends on the "crowdedness" of the blocks.

I mostly agree.
As long as  bitcoin have 
 \- a fixed money supply
 \- a high-value reward
 \- and a limited number of transaction / block
... it will not be suitable to handle any significant proportion of world economic activity, whether as a backbone or as a retail payment system.
My point is that the  transaction / block limit is being ironed out. Slowly, indeed, but give it a few more years.
