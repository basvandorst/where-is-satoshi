I'm assuming you live in the U.S.
This is a complicated question and it depends on when you bought and sold which portions of the BTC. Short- and Long-term capital gains taxes apply to those coins (or fractions thereof) you bought based on when you bought them. You can read [this Fidelity article]( for info on basic methods of determining cost basis.
In scenario 1, your calculation is predicated on a single *cost basis* \- the cost at the time you bought the initial hodled coins. If that date of purchase is more than a year ago, 100 percent of your gains are long term. On the other hand, in scenario 2, you are legally obligated to calculate the cost basis of *every transaction* up the chain and pay short term capital gains on the marginal increase of *all* of them. Brokerages of traditional stock will generally do this math for you and issue you a tax form (they also issue the same form to the IRS to ensure accurate reporting) - Coinbase will do this [if you meet certain criteria]( 
The math gets fuzzy the more transactions you make. The tradeoff is this: in scenario 1 you are risking your whole nut all the time and hoping it keeps going up. In scenario 2 your accounting is wayyyyy more complicated and your tax burden is probably greater, but you can try to minimize risk by selling at rising break points. How much greater the tax burden is depends on how much you sell and when.
