I've always figured Russia has been somewhat-supportive of crypto of late entirely because it can be used to circumvent sanctions.

That's not really true though is it?
Asides from a couple of dips caused by extreme slowdowns during the BCH EDA fluctuations, volume hasn't been this low at all really over the past year.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:57:27
Sure, but you just provide them a BTC address and get paid direct to that, so if someone didn't want the hassle it would work for them.

This is possibly the most fucking stupid thing I've ever read. I actually feel like a drunk Irishman just gave me an impromptu lobotomy with a grapefruit spoon. The sheer weight of stupidity of this post is so massive that it sucks down all of the discourse around it like a black hole and I feel like I've lost 10 or 20 IQ points reading over this trying to see if you were being serious.
Bitcoin is a *currency*. If people don't accept it as payment for goods and services then it has no reason to exist and people will switch to using other coins. Currencies derive their value from their utility, so if nobody wants your currency (and BTC has lost *a lot* of merchant support over fees) then it will lose value relative to others.
Hell, why do you think BTC's market share has tanked in the last year?

Yes they are. The two entities are so closely tied together that they are indistinguishable. They have the same CEO and CFO and are owned by the same people. They used to (not sure if they still do) operate under the same MSB license. They are one and the same.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:39:44
Actually, transaction volume is *way* down. The network could sustain 230k transactions per day on 6 blocks per hour.

@_date: 2018-01-23 19:49:06
Your tinfoil hat may be on a little tight.
Anyway, fees have dropped because transaction volume has dropped and hashrate has increased rapidly. This week BTC has had more than 200 "extra" blocks. Difficulty should adjust in about 36 hours and that will bring the network's transaction capacity back down another 15-20%.
Even then, yesterday's median transaction fee was higher than at any point during the massive fee bump in May 2017:
Nothing has been "fixed".
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:45:15
1- BTC hashrate has significantly increased, with the network operating at around 1.2x its 6 block/hr capacity.
This means that over the last week (with average 7.4 blocks per hour) an extra 253MB (including the extra for SW transactions) has been able to clear.
The network should retarget [in about 36 hours]( and network capacity will drop 20%.
2- [Transaction volume is down](

I do think Tether would be a much, much bigger market event than Bitconnect. How much *actual* money was taken by Bitconnect? We know the market cap, but the actual amount of deposits taken will be far lower.
Tether is a larger scheme and will impact several major exchanges in a big way.

2 billion or so was the "market cap" of BCC. The actual amount of "investment" will be far less.
Similarly, when Madoff went down it was a $50 or 65 or whatever billion dollar ponzi but the amount in actual deposits over the years was thought to be under $20bn. The remainder is just fictional interest that never existed in the first place.

Any thoughts on what caused that jump?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:31:41
Because they already supported BTC, and BCH is extremely easy to implement if you already support BTC (as it's just a BTC clone with bigger blocks).
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:10:13
For present day dollar value I think so yes.

2X was (in theory, although we know how it went in reality) very simple to implement. They just fire up a new node running that version of the client. It was an extremely minimal challenge.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:25:37
The fees have actually come down very slightly, but it's in large part due to some of the pools having particularly good luck (29 blocks in the last 3 hours at the time of writing).

How does the routing work then? Let's say that I have 8 connections to the network, and somebody else is connected to 8 totally different nodes in the network.
How does my transaction get routed when I try to send them BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:46:46
Okay, but how does that route get established? Does my node have to question 8 nodes who question 8 nodes etc? Could end up creating *a lot* of traffic.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:48:07
It's not just about BTC, this should be a concern for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:02:20


A few hours? A $1 226 byte transaction would be about 25sat/byte. There are transactions with fees well over double that which haven't confirmed from more than a week ago:
and that's with us averaging more than 7 blocks per hour, so the difficulty is going to go up by a currently estimated 19% in a few days and the transaction capacity of the network will fall further.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:20:24
How is that routing going to work in practice though? Let's say there are 6 or 7 or 50 "hops" between me and the person I'm sending to - surely that creates an *enormous* amount of traffic with nodes querying each other as to whether they know the person I'm trying to send to.

Long-term, why would people value a coin that nobody accepts for goods and services (because the fees are too high) more highly than any of the other coins that *are* usable as a currency?
The "store of value" argument only works long term when there's something supporting that value.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:39:33


Literally nobody has been claiming that they are.
However with average fees on BTC north of $20 per transaction all merchant adoption is essentially dead in the water, and *something* needed to be done about a year ago to keep the network usable as an actual currency whilst L2 solutions are being implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:35:06
Mate, I've been around in this whole Bitcoin nonsense for more than 6 years now, and for the majority of that time Bitcoin has had a use case. First it was drugs, then it was cheap and fast international payments (and drugs), then it was cheap and fast international payments and money laundering (and drugs).
Now the merchants are dropping it because the fees are excessive, the darknet markets are ditching it because every man and his dog can connect the dots on payments easily and the "mixers" are a joke, and yet the price is completely parabolic.
This is a bubble. It sucks, I would love BTC to be worth $200bn, but it's a bubble.
If you disagree, ask yourself this question:
How many people are buying into BTC now because they have a use for it, and how many are buying into BTC now because the price has gone up so much and they want easy money?
I did alright out of Bitcoin in the early days, I paid off a big chunk of my student debt with money I made mining (used to do &gt;1BTC per day), and had I kept that I would have enough for a pretty lavish yacht.
But I'm not involved with it now. It's not because I don't think the price won't go up further, because it might, but rather because I don't understand what use case is supporting the price at these levels, given the regulatory risks and the competition from other altcoins and the privacy issues and the scaling issues and all that other bullshit. Price continues to rise even whilst fewer and fewer people are using BTC as an actual currency, and I can't see how that is sustainable.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:35:39

Ultimately, forks are going to be required at some point. Even with LN (despite its issues), even with SW, even with Schnorr signatures and all the other developments, forks are going to have to happen in future, that much is guaranteed.

People are paying &gt;$5 to make a single transaction and waiting *days* for it to go through. The network is, frankly, fucking useless for any of the things I used Bitcoin for back in 2011-2013 when I was heavily involved in it. [There are more than 80,000 unconfirmed transactions right now and a significant proportion of those are paying large fees](
Bitcoin is currently slower and more expensive than *every* other altcoin and also slower and more expensive than the traditional banking system. The whole point of BTC used to be that people could use it to actually pay for things...

You're assuming that the non-2x version of Bitcoin will be considered the "main" version come november. At present a significant part of the hashrate is slated to leave.

Because the capacity of the network has fallen now that a large number of miners are mining bitcoin cash. Expect a difficulty drop at some point but with two competing SHA-256 coins there will be periods of lower throughput regardless.

Inferior in terms of network decentralisation, yes, and also in terms of usability and cost.
My friends and I used to use it for settling up minor drinks bills even, I used it to make small purchases from the other side of the world without paypal etc, I used it for all sorts. I used to be able to send funds to a friend on the other side of the world for no fee or a very minimal fee and be quite confident that they'd have those funds within an hour.
Nowadays we've gone back to using bank transfers and paypal, it's cheaper, quicker and simpler.
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:29:07

@_date: 2017-08-08 14:23:12
You already can't send BTC cheaply or in a timely manner.
I stopped mining in 2012 and the bitcoin of today is tremendously inferior to the bitcoin of that time. Who is this all for at this point? I can use a bank transfer for a large payment or a credit card for a small payment and it's now both quicker *and cheaper* than BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:18:58
Bitcoin is useless for that kind of thing now regardless. For transactions less than about $500 the credit card processor I use for my business will have lower fees than those required to get a transaction confirmed in the next day, and credit cards are instantaneous.

Lol, so you think 8MB blocks mean a node would cost $20k due to hard disk space?
Let's examine that theory.
A *completely full and overloaded* hypothetical 8MB block blockchain would grow at 410.6GB per year.
You could buy a 6TB hard drive for less than $200 and store 6 and a half years' worth of the entire chain at max capacity.
$20k would get you around 400TB of high quality NAS and a machine to run it. 400TB would store an 8MB blockchain until your great great great great great great great great great grandchildren were dead and buried.
I can sort of understand some of the arguments about bandwidth and fast block propagation, but arguing that a node on an 8MB network would cost as much as a car is just silly.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:43:35




That's "average transactions per block" and BCC has just burned through 2016 blocks in a few days at a rate of almost a block per minute at times. In real terms it's at more like 5% of BTC's transaction rate.

I tell you what, back when bitpay first started and before my friends and I used to use it for tiny purchases all the time. The network is now so congested and the fees so high that 2017 bitcoin is vastly inferior to 2012 bitcoin for all but very large purchases.

@_date: 2017-11-10 01:18:16
Right, but let's imagine he's sending 92 euros in half an hour. As of right now that'd be a fee somewhere around 10 euros to have a good chance of getting it included in a block in that timeframe. The person on the other end then needs to send it to an exchange or some other method to cash it out, so that's another 10 euro transfer fee, another half-hour wait (plus six confirms), then another fee for the trade, and possibly another fee for the withdrawal.
Forget £5, I'd be surprised if you'd get any change out of £25.

Okay, so what is the ideal block size (or block weight, as it is now I guess) as far as you're concerned?
I just don't buy the "slippery slope" argument, it seems like an easy straw man to me.
Also yes, I get that Segwit allows for bigger blocks, but my concern is that the capacity increase that came with segwit wouldn't be enough to keep the network operating normally (ie, usable as a currency) until further scaling solutions (LN, Schnorr etc etc) are ready.
What do you think would be the maximum block size/weight that BTC could sustain before issues developed, and why?
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:24:11
I'm fairly sure that's a default setting, but even if it weren't that would be the only logical way to operate. If paying a fee didn't give your transaction priority over lower fees then why would anyone pay at all?

Just because something is the first of its kind doesn't mean that it's bound to continue indefinitely. Morse code was pretty revolutionary at the time.
I think cryptocurrencies in general are more or less bound to continue being used at this point, but that doesn't mean that any of the current generation of coins will still be in regular use in 20,30,50 years.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:17:33

Several things:
1- The S2X fork not happening was big news, and it would appear that some market participants are moving holdings from BTC to BCH in response (BTC down 5% and BCH up 30% in the past 24 hours).
2- There is [an enormous transaction backlog]( so it is likely that a lot of transactions to/from exchanges are waiting, so the market may at times be less liquid than normal.
3- Bitcoin's price is based almost entirely on speculation, and there are a lot of day traders out there trading based on "technical analysis" which may exaggerate price swings as day traders try to trade based on momentum.
4- The possible/probable/obvious (depending on who you ask) manipulation of the markets by ifinex (parent of bitfinex/tether etc) and the printing of tens of millions in new tethers recently.

I thought the app by default supports balances for both coins, so regardless of which coin you send it'll just update the balance for the relevant coin. BTC and BCH keys are the same so it shouldn't "burn" anything.

For the time being, the transaction is stuck, and there's not a lot you can do unless you either use a transaction accelerator [like this]( or if your wallet supports it you can do a replace-by-fee transaction with a higher fee.
Without spending more though, you're basically stuck until the mempool clears down to the level of your fee. Could be tonight, could be in several days. Welcome to the scaling debate.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:20:16


It is though, Bitcoin does not have enough capacity for the number of people trying to use it. That is what has driven the fees up.

It's just standard volume, plus a boost in volume from recent news, plus a drop in capacity due to some miners transferring over to BCH as it's currently more profitable.

Segwit only activated a couple of months ago, so I imagine a lot of businesses wanted to wait for it to operate in the wild for a while to see if there were any fundamental issues with it.
Meanwhile almost every block is full:
Also I'd really question the idea of having a block latency of still less than it was for almost all of the last 4 years as a major problem. Block propagation times were around double their current  level throughout 2014, throughout the latter part of 2015 they were regularly 5-10x what they are today. Did that cause the network to stop working?

The problem is that you have vested interests on both sides and a load of people in the middle who don't seem to realise that.
On the one side you have guys like Jihan, who are incentivised to keep transactions on-chain so that they get the fees.
On the other side you have Blockstream, who are incentivised to keep transaction fees high so that businesses will pay for their sidechains [quote from the CEO](

They are not required to pay you one rotten cent for any of their worthless tokens.
Other notable clauses:




This one is also super interesting as it basically states that they cannot be held liable for the value that they or their associates may have "suggested" Tethers have:












any stolen, lost, or unauthorized use of your account information any breach of security or data breach related to your account information; or




The standard excuse is *"Oh well they're required to have that for AML"* which is bull because they already have this robust AML clause:


Oh, and the TOS sets the venue for any court action as the British Virgin Islands, with their famously stringent corporate anonymity. Good luck pursuing them there when you've agreed not to pursue class proceedings and have signed an agreement saying that they don't have to pay you jack shit.

@_date: 2017-11-30 17:01:03
It's not actually, I hadn't made the connection previously that not only was the Tether hack related to other exchange hacks (like Bitstamp) but also the same person had hacked Bitfinex themselves previously... I think that's a salient piece of information that raises some awkward questions about the security at iFinex.

-A phone number
-An address
-The name of the company
There's also the fact that it looks exactly like an antminer...

@_date: 2017-11-27 16:15:27
That wasn't an audit. The document itself says as much. There were accounts there not held in Tether's name directly and Friedman didn't review the agreements surrounding those accounts, nor any of Tether's liabilities, nor did they look at any period before or after that. All of these things would be exceptionally easy to manipulate when you have access to multiple british virgin islands companies.
That is not an audit. If ifinex finally publish an *audit* then I will review my opinions then.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:25:59
You realise that BTC isn't fee free for Amazon either right? If they use a third party they're probably paying a percent or two, if they're doing it on their own they have to pay network fees for moving coin around, and they have to hedge currency risk or pay fees associated with selling coin quickly.
Also I doubt Amazon are paying even 1% to card processors. My store is tiny and I pay 1.4%
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:05:55


No they didn't, [they released that on the 30th of september](


Stop trying to move the goalposts, it's feeble. If Friedman put their name to an *audit* I would take it a lot more seriously. As it stands what has been produced thus far is *not* an audit, for all the reasons I have already explained.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:22:49
There's also the fact that BTC tends to average a little more than 6 blocks per hour (as hashrate increases) whereas the BCH difficulty algo should in theory stay closer to 6. BTC may start to catch up slightly. Not by very much, it'd probably take several years or more to catch up nearly 10000 blocks, but there we are.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:21:07


Half, for about a day or so until their difficulty algo adjusts it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:40:58
Well, also BTC tends to be more congested around midnight GMT - simply as the hours prior to this are peak time as both the US and European users are making transactions simultaneously and these are still two of bitcoin's largest markets.
Part of the reason for the mempool rise today is that miners have switched to BCH, and since the BTC blockchain is running more or less at capacity even a minor reduction in capacity (through increased block times) causes fees to rise dramatically.

In that case you really need to work on your reading comprehension. The bitstamp hack wallet was the first address in this whole chain to *make* a payment.

It seems that BTC's hashrate has jumped up a bit, or just some good luck as well:
Average of 9.33 blocks per hour over the past 3 hours, 7.33 over the past 12, 6.76 over the past day at the time of writing. That's an extra 17 blocks or so over the past day which will have cleared maybe around 30,000 transactions.
Now that the BCH EDA is fixed though it should stop a lot of the wild multi-day swings in hashrate that were the cause of some of the worse bits of congestion. Will be interesting to see how things go over the next 2-3 difficulty adjustment periods.

It's not an "all or nothing" issue though.
A pretty standard home desktop PC from 3-5 years ago with a decent sized hard drive could handle blocks a lot larger than what we have at the moment. Hell, there are plenty of ETH nodes out there and they're handling near enough double the daily transaction volume of BTC now.
Yes, if you wanted to handle the sort of volumes that VISA etc handle in blockchain form then you'd need some pretty crazy hardware and connectivity to deal with that, but nobody's suggesting that.
Personally, I think it's reached the point wherein high fees are more damaging to BTC than larger blocks would be. Hell, block propagation times are now lower than at almost any time in Bitcoin's history.


The concern I think is more that just as Jihan et al are financially motivated to try to keep as many transactions on-chain as possible (to collect the fees), Blockstream are financially motivated to try to keep fees high (as that drives demand for the sidechains for which they will sell access to businesses). Personally I'm a little uncomfortable with people who have a financial interest in the scaling debate (on either side) having significant control over development on scaling.

Lots of other coins do this.


Surely private coins like Monero are better at this.


Every other coin does this.


Every other coin and quite a lot of non-crypto payment methods do this.
Almost all other coins do this.
The same people own all the major hubs of discussion and a half-dozen individuals control more than half the hashrate. One single rather dodgy exchange (bitfinex) is responsible for a large chunk of all the volume.


"small scale" being payments under $4000? Because that's roughly the point at which Bitcoin becomes worth using at these fee levels.


Is what people have been saying since 2013.


Notably BCH is up 40% and BTC is down 7% in the past 24 hours.
Nobody is saying that layer 1 can handle all payments for everyone globally forever. Nobody. Not even on What people are saying is that the network can tolerate some amount of on-chain scaling, to keep the network usable for all of the things that currencies are used for until L2/L3/etc solutions are ready.

Aren't miners basically able to do the same thing right now? If you mine mostly empty blocks you can bring the capacity of the network down and push fees up so that when you start mining full blocks again it increases your fee income.
You could exclude outliers in the calculation (transactions with anomalously high or low fees compared to the mean), and at that point any attacker wanting to drive the maximum size up that way would need to control a large proportion of the network hashrate (as if they succeed in pushing the block size up then fees outside of their own blocks will fall) and the block size would rapidly settle down again after they stopped. They would succeed only in reducing their own fee income.
Or maybe there's a better way that it could be managed?

3- I come out of the whole thing having gone through an extraordinary amount of hassle and expense that I wouldn't experience going through Bitpay or Globee or just accepting more conventional payment methods.

When this happened back in August it led to periods of 1-2 days when BTC was getting maybe 3 blocks per hour, then BCH would adjust up again, the hashrate would leave, another EDA would trigger and bam, another 1-2 days of 3 blocks per hour.
With the transaction volume being fairly close to the limit most of the time as it is, this sent fees to the moon, and the backlog was such that it didn't even have time to completely clear between EDA cycles.
You can see the effect from last time (starting early august) here:
Somehow BTC and BCH were in a fairly fragile state of difficulty equilibrium for a while recently, but right now BTC is far more profitable to mine (~30% more) and so the majority of BCH miners have switched.
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:55:57

It's worth noting though that they're putting out a lot less empty blocks now than they used to. From the linked article, they were producing 8.2% empty blocks in 2015, 4.2% empty blocks in 2016, and only 1.8% empty blocks in 2017. Proportionally they're no longer the worst offender.

How? Surely that's just exactly the same economic incentive that exists currently, wherein miners are free to choose not to process low fee transactions. In reality, a miner would need to control a significant amount of the network hashrate to manipulate the fees with this block sizing method.

Bitfinex doesn't trade USD.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:47:02
It most likely depends on:
1- The scale of the ban (what's banned? will exchanges be allowed to re-open subject to licensing requirements? will they make it illegal to transact in btc/cryptos at all? will they shut down their local miners and if so when?)
2- How many people in the Chinese market already sold in the recent crash.
I do think some sort of crash is fairly likely, but it depends on the exact wording of any ban. If Chinese BTC users are forced to liquidate into CNY (and that means real money, no crypto-based IOUs so no USDT for example) then that would likely drive prices down hard, and would also likely create some significant cross-exchange arbitrage opportunities for people with accounts on both international and chinese domestic exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:33:27
Unless we see another big crash tomorrow after OkCoin and Huobi meet with the regulators.

@_date: 2017-09-21 12:05:05
The money miners bring in isn't even a rounding error to the Chinese economy. If they want to restrict bitcoin entirely in their domestic market it's a logical step to take, otherwise there is just a constant flow of new coin.

@_date: 2017-09-14 17:16:58
So? They can control the actual use cases Bitcoin has, and they can ban the exchanges. If you can't exchange Bitcoin for regular currency then merchants won't support it and without any use case the value would crash.
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:38:56
If the next BCH block isn't here within ~2 hours it will trigger another EDA adjustment and the BCH difficulty will drop rapidly.
If it comes within the next 2 hours but there haven't been 2 BCH blocks mined within the next 2.5 hours then that will also trigger the EDA.
Given the depths that the BCH hashrate has sunk to there might then be a series of 20% reductions in difficulty, leading to BCH being significantly more profitable than BTC for a few days and we'll see huge amounts of hashrate going back and forth between the two chains again.
Basically, it's a repeat scenario of what was happening throughout August.
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:36:44
So without replay protection you'd never really be in a stable "hard fork" situation with two functional separate currencies akin to the BTC/BCH situation?
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:08:20
I agree, but every decision you could make with regard to chain scaling has its downsides I think. Increasing the block size by some significant fixed amount encourages very low fees and means that those blocks are likely to grow more quickly than they would with higher fees. Leaving the block size as it is creates issues whenever transaction volume goes up or the number of blocks per hour goes down as the fee market is very rigid and a small shortage in available block space creates a large increase in fees, likewise a small overhead in available block space creates a large decrease in fees (for example with the BTC/BCH difficulty oscillations recently).
Whatever decision is taken it's likely that it's going to have to be looked at again in the future, I just think that a solution like this would be more optimal for longer than any given fixed block size.
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:01:13


So how do you scale that?
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:28:24
You can see the current state of the mempool here:
Transactions with fees lower than about 50sat/B haven't made it on the blockchain for about 12 hours at the time of writing. For your 5Sat/B transaction to confirm the mempool is going to have to basically clear. That may happen during the night in the UK/USA when the mempool typically shrinks, or it may take a lot longer (especially if the current China situation creates an increase in transaction volume as people rush to transfer or sell coins).

I don't get that logic personally, surely if 2X succeeds then it eliminates the major selling point of BCH (increased transaction throughput, greater on-chain scaling). If I were holding large amounts of BCH I'd be all over this  bollocks.
Realistically though, there has to be some way to have a block size limit that scales automatically going forward, you could (for example) have the maximum block size scale relative to the ratio of total fees paid to block reward in the last x blocks (and you could change that scaling with each block reward halving going forward). That way, hopefully, an equilibrium could be achieved wherein there are sufficient fees paid to incentivise miners to include as many transactions as possible, whilst also ensuring that the network doesn't hit a wall every time transaction volume increases or hashrate decreases.
Given the absolute disaster that it's been politically trying to get the block size increased *once*, something like this would ensure that we don't have to go through this bullshit again in 4 years time.
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:06:22
Possible scenarios include but are not limited to:
- USDT is exposed as a massive scam, Tether/Bitfinex go under, large amounts of currency disappear from the system entirely and multiple exchanges go down either due to a lack of deposit methods or significant margin lending against a now-worthless asset.
- Significant regulation in any of Bitcoin's major markets that makes it harder to transact in Bitcoin. If merchants won't accept your currency its value will fall, likewise if it's very difficult to convert between Bitcoin and regular money then that will make Bitcoin less useful.
- Fallout related to the november hardfork (depending on the outcome, could lead to a lot of negative articles about BTC and crypto in general).
- Users switching to other coins, as with ETH earlier in the year, either because of lower fees or improved features, reducing the demand for BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:14:51


Not surprising, this isn't the same that existed 2-3 years ago.


The fuck are you on about? It will be exactly the same chain that exists now, but with more transaction capacity. It has always been that the overwhelming majority of the mining community working together can change rules in Bitcoin. You want to talk about centralisation of power? *One guy* controls bitcoin.org, bitcoin.it, bitcointalk and @_date: 2017-09-20 13:22:57
The total of all BTC emission right now is about $2.6 billion per year (at $4k BTC price)
That would make BTC mining in china a ~$1.5bn/year industry based on hashrate alone. That is chump change to the Chinese government, especially compared with the threat Bitcoin poses to their control over the currency.
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:52:16


As someone who was basically absent from the BTC community for a good 3-4 years, I've found this phenomenon most interesting. It's amazing how so many of the big names who were really driving Bitcoin's development forward back then are now more or less "Enemies of the people!!!" on here...
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:53:55
It sort of is:
Given that you have pools like Antpool etc occasionally mining empty blocks having the average that close to the limit for most of the last year is quite startling.
Fees don't really take off until the blockchain is more or less full and transactions start getting stuck in the mempool for extended periods of time, and you can see how often that's happened here:
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:29:06

Major reduction in hashrate for both BTC and BCH - depending on how far BTC is from a retarget at that point it could slow transactions down significantly and send fees to the moon for several weeks. It would likely also trigger BCH's EDA mechanism and cause another set of hashrate oscillations between the two chains.
Additionally, depending on how those firms are liquidated there could be a lot of cheap mining hardware available after... or it could all just get thrown in a landfill somewhere.
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:12:08


In what possible sense? Are you trying to argue that back throughout August and May when the network was horribly congested that it wasn't at the limit?
^This is a better visualisation, you can see how much of the time BTC spent maxed out.
BTC is doing pretty well right not but in part that's because it's sitting at more than 6 blocks per hour (currently ~7/hr over the past day and ~6.6/hr over the past week). So the capacity of the network is elevated over its normal level.
If that capacity falls then you'll see a repeat of exactly what happened in August, the mempool will grow significantly and fees will go up a lot. It might also increase the rate of Segwit adoption, which would be interesting to see.

I'm more worried about Bitcoin's legal future than I used to be as a result of the whole China situation. I think we're about to see what it looks like when a country tries to ban crypto.

More companies support 2x here than oppose it, and many of the companies counted are minor nothing-outfits.
Doesn't measure 2x support.


The majority surveyed here were in favour of 2MB blocks and a majority were also in favour of dynamic scaling of maximum block size (despite the fact that these stats were gathered by luke-jr).


That's entirely meaningless, people use core because that's the client that is available. It's an absolutely terrible gauge of opinion.

I wouldn't necessarily put Kraken on the same list as the others there, they only have the USD/USDT market, they don't mis-represent Tether as being equivalent to USD or use it in other trading pairs. It's a pretty low-volume pair too.

So? They can control the actual use cases Bitcoin has, and they can ban the exchanges. If you can't exchange Bitcoin for regular currency then merchants won't support it and without any use case the value would crash.

It would make sense for them to do so if the aim of the action was to prevent people using BTC exchanges to circumvent capital controls.

A bit harsh, although yes BCH is vulnerable at present. The EDA is quite poorly designed, something like Monero's system where difficulty is based on the mean block time of the last 720 blocks (so that difficulty adjusts block-by-block rather than every 2016 blocks) would have been far superior and wouldn't have lead to this ridiculous situation wherein hashrate oscillates wildly between BTC and BCH.

@_date: 2017-10-16 17:32:50


How does it do that? If BTC got to that sort of size it would be relatively easy for governments to regulate it such that big companies and the like would have a hard time trading between BTC and traditional currencies. Also I just don't see many offshore companies choosing to transact on a public blockchain. If they want to trade privately there are other means (both other cryptos and other methods within regular currencies) that are more private than BTC.
I think cryptocurrencies are an important tech but let's not over-sell it.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:40:51
Isn't China roughly 65% of the hashrate? Could lead to 30 minute blocks, more at times if BCH activates EDA and the BTC/BCH hashrate oscillations start up again.

You've said it better than I ever will. It's so incredibly unhelpful. Hard to believe that this is an argument over *the right value for an integer in a piece of software*...

Honestly, how? Given that it's *the same* except for 1MB block limit being 2MB, how would that "undermine what Bitcoin is"?

@_date: 2018-02-01 18:06:50
Could not agree more.
Another question I would have for people is "how to you justify a particular valuation for BTC/ETH/whatever?"
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:21:41
Every day for the past few days blocks have been completely full during peak time. If transaction volume went up even 20% fees would skyrocket. Segwit allows for some increase and hopefully as its adoption increases it will relieve some of the pressure *for now*, but BTC should aim to scale such that it can handle the sort of transaction volumes that major credit card processors and the like have long-term, which means an absolutely massive amount of scaling needs to be able to happen.
Essentially the whole controversy comes down to a disagreement of how Bitcoin should look in the future. The "Core" approach would be small blocks, with the bulk of transactions occuring off-chain through options like the lightning network etc. This has the advantage that hardware requirements for running nodes remain very low, but has the disadvantage that fees are likely to rise in the short to medium term, which hurts adoption (just look at how much market share BTC lost to ETH when fees went sky-high earlier this year). The argument is that it is essential for end users to be able to easily run their own nodes in order to promote network decenentralisation.
The other approach (favoured by BCH/2X) is to increase the block size, which increases the number of transactions that can go through before fees start increasing (fees only really become relevant when the network is congested). This has the advantage of allowing for significant growth near-term before fees start increasing, which keeps bitcoin price-competitive with other coins for users, however it increases the hardware/connectivity requirements of nodes. With 8MB blocks, the chain would grow at up to ~400GB per year - a couple of years of that and you wouldn't see too many people running their own nodes, syncing the blockchain when it's &gt;1TB would take a long time and I doubt many users would bother. There would likely also be some increase in orphaned blocks etc as blocks would take longer to propagate. Supporters of this change argue that it's not necessary for the majority of users to run a node, and that keeping bitcoin price-competitive is more important than every user being able to run their own node.
The rest of the hyperbole is just this ridiculous political shitstorm that's come up with both sides accusing each other of being controlled by outside influences (Blockstream on this side, Jihan for BCH).
For my part, I think that neither side has it totally right. The ideal scenario for Bitcoin is that fees exist at a level that incentivises miners to include all the transactions they can in their blocks, but a level that doesn't make bitcoin significantly more expensive than other payment methods. Having a fixed block size basically ensures that this is never going to happen, as if blocks are full usage can't grow without driving fees to the moon, and if blocks aren't full then there's no incentive for users to include any significant fee.
I like the way Monero handles this with dynamic block sizes and a reduction in block reward when miners process blocks larger than the limit, however their system isn't really perfect either.

Roughly until the heat death of the universe.
(Not that that's likely, it's just *possible* - there's nothing to say that the mempool will shrink, but FYI it usually does when it's night in the US and Europe).
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:06:24


Are you seriously trying to suggest that the Chinese government et al could easily disrupt a chain with 2MB or 4MB or 8MB or whatever size blocks, but not one with 1MB blocks? That's a ridiculous argument. If the Chinese government wanted to disrupt bitcoin they could simply make it illegal to transact in bitcoin.


It was an example, but also if people are paying several dollars for a transaction that still takes hours what incentive to they have to use Bitcoin?


That's a myth. It was true in the Satoshidice days but less so now.
The average dollar-denominated amount of BTC transactions is now well into the thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:24:04
S2X is arguably the biggest threat to BCH, as if it's successful it removes a lot of the incentive for users to switch to BCH as its major selling point (increased on-chain scaling) will be lost.
If 2X wins I would expect to see the price of BCH drop significantly.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:44:57
Why not? If there's say 20K BTC on its way to exchanges that's stuck in the mempool, that's over $110 million in sell-side volume that's waiting to be executed.

Nope. They just call it "USD" but it's actually Tethers. There's no actual exchange going on, and you can't withdraw USD.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:59:35
This isn't very clear - as in you made a trade which went through but the funds from that trade didn't reach your account? Or you made a withdrawal and it's not reached your bank account?

Would they have enough hashrate for a functional 51% attack?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:27:10
Even 24 hours is quite a bit of variance when you're only talking about 15-20% of the hashrate. That's only like 20-30 blocks per day. Seems to be mostly F2Pool and Slush. Presumably it'll also fluctuate due to certain pools switching between BTC and BCH (does F2Pool do that?)
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:30:27


Before fees got to that level you would have lost incredible amounts of market share to ETH etc. Just look at what happened earlier in the year when BTC's fees went consistently high...


In that case they'd be better off using something like Monero if they need privacy, or any number of other coins without such high fees if they don't.

Realistically if it's just a straightforward port of the Core client but allowing for a doubling in block size then how much development does it really need?
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:59:34


That's extraordinarily unlikely either way around for a fork like this without replay protection. If one chain has minimal hashing power for a week plus as in your example, then it would be basically unusable throughout that time (and quite possibly for a long time after) as the transaction capacity would fall dramatically. At that point, people are going to be using whichever chain allows them to actually make transactions (in some reasonable timeframe and without insane fees).

Presumably, were 2x to come out of November as the dominant fork, much of the development would switch over from the current core chain to that.
At the moment is there much need for ongoing development of 2x? It's not pitching itself as anything other than a straight port bitcoin Core with one integer changed is it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:56:24


When? We've been talking about this since at least 2014. The entire reason for all of these stupid fucking forks is that a capacity increase has been coming " Soon^tm " for at least two years now.


Then why is the network full?
Every single day this week there have been transactions that have taken hours despite paying fees over 1 USD. The entire selling point of Bitcoin that brought me into it in 2011 was that it could be used for sending money internationally and making purchases from anyone anywhere quickly and cheaply. Nowadays it's not worth using BTC for transactions less than a couple of hundred dollars or that you need to happen quickly.
Oh, and these mempool backlogs right now are happening with BTC mining about 7 blocks per hour. When the difficulty adjusts later this week the network stands to lose a significant amount of its daily transaction capacity.
The arguments about hardware costs etc are one thing, but I don't know how you can possibly support an argument that there's no demand for bigger blocks when people are regularly paying multiple dollars to process a single transaction and waiting several hours at minimum for it to process.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:42:35
Yeah for sure, I'm just saying that as a bunch of pools are currently mining a lot of BCH the percentage is likely to fluctuate once those pools go back to the BTC chain, and also just looking at a 144 block window it's bound to fluctuate by quite a lot, probably better to look over a week (although I guess you'd have to add up all of F2Pool's blocks from before they stopped signalling at this point).
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:43:44


Presumably such a situation would be highly chaotic without replay protection so it's likely that they would suspend trading until a clear winner emerged.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:45:13
Mind explaining that one? What makes you think that average transaction size would go up so much? They've had an 8MB block with 37000 transactions (although that appeared to be a test/spam).
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:38:24
Although with the state of the mempool (and the upcoming difficulty increase and possibly more hashrate oscillations between BTC and BCH) there's a good chance that transactions made days or weeks before the split with low fees end up executing on both chains.
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:40:01


Then mine ETH or XMR, y'know, chains people actually use. Who the fuck will be lining up to buy BTG?
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:27:48
It's possible that it doesn't fork at that block though. Plenty of people plan to stop moving coin around then due to the risk of no replay protection, so it's entirely possible that you won't see a &gt;1MB block immediately.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:37:55

Depending on the state of the mempool at the time of the fork, I can see it being quite a few blocks before the 1X and 2X chains actually conflict. Lots of major players planning to suspend activity temporarily around the time of the fork may mean that it takes a while for a &gt;1MB block to be produced post-fork (unless there are transactions in the mempool or somebody generates a couple thousand low-fee transactions to force it which may also occur).

What exactly is your objection to a 2MB block limit instead of a 1MB limit?

Any number of things. Other coins that improve on BTC, government regulation of BTC (for example if the US banned retailers from accepting it or exchanges from offering it that would be a huge impact), or just a change in market sentiment.
Crypto markets in general are highly volatile and more than a little irrational, because everything is basically just speculation on potential future uses. It's sort of like the NYSE circa-1999

Why would there be any development on that fork prior to November? Serious question...
If literally the only change is changing a 1MB block limit to a 2MB block limit, then surely the logical thing to do would be to take whatever the up to date version of Core is in November and change the values in that?
Why would the people behind 2X put extra work in this far ahead?
