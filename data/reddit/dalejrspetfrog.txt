Thank you for these wise words.  I'm small time chipping away at buying one full BTC.  Been stressing a lot about future, savings, and acquiring wealth.....anyways....thanks for the words.  Good timing for me.

Does anyone use NEO in China for currency purposes?
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:11:31
Are there exchanges for neo to fiat in China?    
Basically I'm just curious in asking if there is any applicable use for crypto beyond speculation in China at the moment.  Thank you for answering.

Completely agree.  Think of your education as "free mining" once you pay it off.  Your education and work capacity will generate way more money than BTC will over your lifetime.  
That being said I'd pay off at least 1/2 of your loans to get the ball rolling and then ride out the BTC roller coaster!
Congrats on both of your successes!

GDAX is how I purchase as well.
No complaints with CB.  Super easy inroad.

I own my own business and really want to start accepting bit coin.  Do you immediately transfer the BC to fiat to keep the accountants happy?  (I know that defeats the purpose of BC acceptance) but my biggest concern is attracting attention for an audit due to holding onto BC after receiving a payment.  
Capital gains, etc, all that.
How are most businesses that are accepting B.C. keeping the books easy?
