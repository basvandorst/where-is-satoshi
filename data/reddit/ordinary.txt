Tbh look at EVERY fucking year since bitcoin was a thing
It drops big time mid-January
How are any of you surprised?
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:43:21
And she’s going back up, boys!!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:30:38
Except not really
More like buy bitcoin
Forget about it
Come back in a year with twice as much money
@_date: 2018-11-12 02:46:46
Before you sell come up with a plan for how you spend/invest the money
My opinion is hold until at least after the spike that is probably going to happen around the new year
Also make sure your bitcoins are offline and in a hard wallet ASAP. Like, right this moment

I don’t fucking get y’all
How the fuck are you trading?
This shit is amazing. Literally was looking forward to today all last week 
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:34:24
Well hodlers did
But margin traders may not have
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:29:04
What? That’s retarded.
I short bitcoin when it makes sense because I’m trying to increase my BTC holdings in the short-term - BY MAKING FUCKING MONEY
It literally has nothing to do with any principles or any bullshit. I short when it makes sense and I go long when it makes sense. In this way I’m able to double my fucking profits.
It’s fucking simple. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:23:46
Yeah but you can still make money on shit pumps brah 
I just did :)
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:43:03
Well you gotta make sure you jerk off before you trade
@_date: 2018-07-20 13:18:33
Goddamnit. Bitcoin be all like “$7400? r/thisismylifenow”
This shit is torturous 
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:32:37
Well personally I’m not long anymore. I’m considering shorting right now to somewhere around 7k, if it loses downward momentum around there
Then wait it out for a week or so to see how it behaves 
@_date: 2018-07-20 23:07:44
I’m not badmouthing bitcoin at all, what? In fact I’m lending to its stability and therefore credibility 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:24:43
Cool, then let’s short!!!
Edit: it actually doesn’t look anything like a “classic” bull trap on the charts. The daily is a gorgeous reverse head and shoulders, though the weekly does seem to indicate at least one more return to 6k so maybe you’re right... Overall I agree jumping in this month will be risky.
We’ll see how far all of the positive rumors will carry it
Either way making money is no problem - movement means dollars my friends

Accumulate by using the pendulum swings and margin trading to your advantage brother
It’s practically magic. It’s like rubbing two dollar bills together to make a third
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:22:26
The reverse head and shoulders on the daily is picture perfect
