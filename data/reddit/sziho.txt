Every time somebody says that, the next morning When I check the price it’s up again like 500. 
To me it seems that Asia likes to buy when somebody say “wait till Asia wakes.” Or you mean the price will go up when you say ugly?

Classy coder is a bot, just ignore it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:18:23
why would you sell before the hearing is beyond me
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:50:11
Same here. I bought when it was 8.5
My two regrets so far is I didn’t invest more and that I didn’t sell half when it was 12. 
So I bought some now and hodling

So anybody’s who commenting “ah itt will drop below 6k” or “ah it will be around 100k by the end of the year”
Or  12k by monday. Please for the love of the crypto gods, comment also based on what. Otherwise we will automatically assume you pulled out of your ass. 
Not judging, I just don’t think it’s valuable info and it’s rather distracting. 
So here’s my prediction. 
Even though cryptos were around for a long time now, the world is only catching up now. If you go on the street and ask a random somebody 50% chance they will say it’s witchcraft. And this is why it’s important to talk about it. 
So the more and more ppl will understand it and regulations by governments are settled the price will become more stable. 
The us congress had s debate on valentines day. If the crypto world world truly are in danger of crashing, then why would their defence department invest in upgrading their systems to support cryptos on quantum computers. 
Not to mention all the miners who destroyed the VGA market and made it very Very hard to buy a gtx 1080 Ti. Now they are probably part of the resistance since they have hardware investments in it as well. 
The banks hate it probably, since it can hurt their business so I am expecting a lot of media fear mongering. 
Also don’t forget 
Koreas: “we will ban bitcoin”
*Korea buys bitcoin*
Korea: “Oh, we won’t ban bitcoin after all.”
Still read the news politics and tech. But know who controls them. 
Please share your opinion. I don’t mind if being told I am wrong, quite the contrary I love a healthy debate.
