Me as well. I have $230 in Coinbase, and I have no idea which wallet to switch to. It’s handy to have a wallet app that is easy to navigate. Gemini won’t verify me, and neither will Bitstamp.

According to the majority on here, everything is wrong with Coinbase. Yes—card purchases are my only option, because wallets only give me so many choices for a bank. My bank is Black Hills Federal Credit Union. They also aren’t permitting my transactions to Coinbase anymore, so I have to call them ��

What I mean is that I can’t lose something like $1,000, so I plan in investing in the hundreds.

Okay now I’m seeing that I can invest $2,000 tomorrow, and in a perfect world if the value doubles in two months, I have $4,000 and I could invest $500 more. If it continues—another 100% and I’m at $9,000, and so on.
Here’s a dumb question: 
Can you explain to me what causes the value of btc to increase?

Gemini has not verified me yet. It’s been a month.

I could set up a $200 each month plan to invest. Is this wise, if I’m trying to end up with quite a bit of money in btc (I want to have atleast $5,000 invested overall)? Of course, I would watch the numbers, and only invest if the value is headed up.

I understand how frustrating it is with this many noobs, but can someone explain how to turn your bitcoin into private keys and/or send a link to an explanation?
