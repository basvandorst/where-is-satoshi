Wtf is this stupid shit.
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:00:31
Alright... reddit needs to stop using the word wholesome. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:36:30
Seriously. If you lost everything that was 100% your own fault. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:32:07
Cry me a river. Read up and invest with knowledge. If you lost everything I have no sympathy. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:12:01
Wow what a witty response. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:46:58
Wow yeah, I don’t like talking about memes at parties, I must be such a buzzkill.
 Have you even been to a party? I’m gonna bet the only parties you’ve been to involved birthday cake and blow up fun castles. Drinking 3 beers and throwing up at best. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:06:55
That’s right, a little bitch like I expected.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:29:48
They definitely hate the term bcash, I didn’t realize it was so taboo there. Is there anything to bch? Or is it just riding the coat tails if BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:20:09
What a beta bitch. Go back  to t_d with the rest of you.
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:22:33
Seriously. Been here since $600. This has happened so many times it’s funny at this point. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:52:15
Calling everything buzzwords? Did you just regurgitate some response you’ve read before? It doesn’t apply here. Just another sign t_d users are little teenage cucks. You’re going to look back on this when your 20 and feel embarrassed as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:14:18
Aww no your funny. It’s cute how hard you try. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:00:21
Lol, no. I own a home. I am 30. That’s not who’s in that shithole sub. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:27:51
Nah, wimpy 12 year olds with no friends, pretending to know about politics isn’t my scene. You should hit it up though, sounds like you’d fit right in. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 11:03:15
Lol swank memes? Found the 13 year old. 
T_d is the most cringy shit I’ve ever seen. “Swank memes” pretty much sums it up. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:41:16
Hmm interesting I did have a little before the fork, how do I go about claiming it? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:20:28
You realize this sub is 90% pro trump  kids still in high school  right?
@_date: 2017-04-28 02:40:13
Local bitcoins has a steep mark up but I was going to resort to that. Thanks for the link. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 02:43:07
Kraken does not work. Should I use tor or something?
@_date: 2017-04-28 02:43:37
Honolulu bitcoin meet up lady? What's that!?
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:56:52
Cool thanks btc bro! What time?
@_date: 2017-09-16 22:28:17
Teenagers came and really dumbed this place down. Any suggestions for real discussion?
