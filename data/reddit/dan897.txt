Electrum multisig is great because it doesnt require a full node like armory does.

I think its personal Preference. I dont think you can say how many... I t will be different for everyone. On what kind of security they want vs ease of use. For example an offline only old laptop that only signs transactions and then sends them to an online computer via QR code is "very" secure. Because your private keys are never exposed to a computer with internet access. However the usability / ease of use is higher than just using a normal wallet. I think trezor kind of fits in the middle here. Allowing easy use on a computer without exposing your private keys.  
I guess the question to ask yourself is... Is $100 investment worth protecting how ever many bitcoins you own and how much they are worth now and or could be worth in the future and of course any more bitcoins you could aquire. Not to mention you can use other coins with trezor too. If you answer that as a yes then get on! Its too late when your wallets have been emptied because of a keylogger or something else.  Ofcourse the alternative is using a paper wallet or again an old laptop without an internet connection for signing only.  
Or you could get one of the cheaper $20 hardware wallets. Its personal preferance. I own just over 5 BTC at the moment (bit its constantly increasing) and i purchased one when i went over 2BTC because i saw the $100 as a worth while cost to protect my investment.

IT means you dont have the private keys. When you made the wallet you wrote down the seed words right? Recover the wallet using them.

Ok i get the interesting bit. But moving coins does not necessarily mean cashing out, might wanted to just split it over wallets.
Also wouldnt it be difficult for him to cash out? His wallet address' are known and government body's ext could try to trace the transactions to who he sold them to and try to trace him?

Try changing servers tools &gt; network..
mine is node.arihanc.com if you want to try that one
@_date: 2015-08-04 18:44:27
So sorry for sounding stupid but if he or it or the entity had moved coins why would it be news anyway?

If you know the address you could check it on blockchain.info or another site like it.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:36:05

Generally you have an online portion as a watch address using the xpub (On the offline go Wallet &gt; Master Public. Then with this string XPUB go to your online computer and load up electrum. Go to New/Restore Standard Wallet &gt; Use pubic or private keys. paste that xpub... Now this is a watch only wallet i can watch for transactions and balances but has NO private keys. Using this wallet create a transaction which you store on USB in a file. You take that file to your offline tails load up your wallet and go tools &gt; import transaction.. Sign it and save it back to the USB. Then you go back to the online electrum and click tools &gt; load transaction (picking the signed version of the file) and transmit it.
Hope this helps

Most likely pulled from a full node doing the calculate command.
bitcoin-cli estmatefee 5 (estimate what i should pay to be in the next 5 blocks / KB) so % by 1000 for per byte.
0.00320777 (is the current answer) = 0.00000320
Considering Mempool is nearly empty i think the bitcoin core has an issue with estimating correctly.

That's going to the address of the recent cryptovirus xD

People claiming its there's but unable to supply proof... So yeh just the usual i guess. No one has contacted me with a signed message from the sending address(s) yet.
