you should focus your efforts elsewhere as all you are going to accomplish is spending a lot of money on electricity with nothing to show for it.
bitcoin network never really "needs" more or less hashpower, the difficulty self adjusts. so unless you are willing to spend the kind of money it takes to be a serious miner there is no point to it.

depends if BTC wants to be "the one". not that there even needs to be a "the one" there could be dozens of successful crypto currencies running side by side used to represent the entire wealth of our global civilization, it doesnt have to be just one coin. But if Bitcoin can appeal to all the reasons why some other today-rinky-dink coin might attract new users and keep those users focussed on bitcoin then it may be able to remain as "the one".

i think if the majority of the hashpower refused to build on top of spammy attack blocks generated by rogue miners then it would be fine. as long as the majority of the hashpower wants bitcoin to remain viable then it should be fine. at this moment the majority of the hashpower, if it didnt want bitcoin to be viable, could simply stop including transactions. so we already have to rely on miners to do the right thing for the sake of the coin.

@_date: 2015-06-07 18:14:05
miners are already trusted to bother including transactions. they do it because they have money to make from fees. why would they make stupidly oversized blocks unless there was enough fee to justify it? what is the compromise to full nodes other than temporarily having to look at an oversized block? i'm assuming that this large block would inconvenience the majority of the hashpower, and they would not mine on top of it, it would end up on not-the-longest-chain. in that case couldnt the full node now just delete the oversized block and forget it ever existed?

and what if miners made it a policy to not build on top of stupidly oversized blocks with a number they come up with as the threshold for where things have gotten stupid. so if some rogue miner decides to make a 1000MB block the rest of the hashpower just thumbs their nose and keeps building on the branch of the chain that doesnt include that oversized block. Why wouldnt that work?
@_date: 2015-06-07 18:28:09
so then why would any miner ever bother to include a transaction that doesnt have a fee? there is literally nothing in it for them, unless you count "keeping bitcoin alive, because we want a functional money system that people want to use" as part of a reason for miners to include a no-fee transaction. seems reasonable to me but maybe I'm missing something. If thats the reason they include any no-fee transactions at all then why would it not also be the same reason not to mine an oversized block and/or not to build on an oversized block that some other miner made.

first of all its not even a problem so not sure why you are trying to solve it, and second your solution is faulty since the miner could just make up 50 transactions that move around coins they already own just to satisfy this new requirement.

for 1% of the DoD budget they can blockade the network by outmining it. If they really want to fight bitcoin, they can and will do this. I would like to see the hashpower grow to require more like 1000% of DoD budget to outmine.

@_date: 2015-06-12 02:06:25
if i make up 50 transactions, dont broadcast them, mine a block successfully that includes those 50 transactions and then broadcast that block, then anyone who receives the block can immediately start building on it. they know the 50 transactions that i created in secret as soon as they finish downloading my block. and they need to finish downloading the block before they begin mining a new block anyway because they need to validate it. as long as my 50 transactions are valid, it will be accepted.
if we agree on that then i think i misunderstood your original assertion.

to understand where bitcoins come from requires a bit of a technical understanding of the protocol, which I am not sure if you'd want to get into here, but suffice it to say the Bitcoin system is all about keeping a big, verifiable ledger up to date, through a "difficult" process of adding new pages to said ledger and each new page comes with a reward of new bitcoins granted to the successful accountant. But you don't need to worry about any of that when you just want to use it to receive payments without chargeback risk. To further eliminate even exchange rate risk you can use a payment processor like Bitpay for a fee significantly lower than credit card processing fees. And no there is no transaction fees for you to receive bitcoin payments directly.

the algorithm defines a problem that is to be solved (find a block hash that is a lower number than the 'target'). the difficulty of the problem is adjusted by the algorithm based on the speed of blocks getting found. the successful miner or pool doesnt receive the block, they successfully create (aka find) it, and for this they receive the block reward (plus any transaction fees as well). You repeat part of a sentence starting 'The more computers participating', the first version of the sentence is better.
bitcoin wallets can be traced to a person unless the person takes special steps to prevent it, which the average user likely isnt doing. 2140 is the original target date for the last block reward, and i hear 2040 as a date when like 99.9% of all btc will be mined by. but in 2024 it will probably still be getting 3.125 BTC per block
i only picked on that divisibility item because you said 'can be infinitely divided' but then right after that you said the smallest unit was a satoshi. anyway there currently is a very real limit to the divisibility and it might be worth mentioning that and the fact that this could be made even divisible in the future if truly needed.

by the time BTC is worth something very significant, comparing it to central bank money will probably be meaningless. how much inflation will have affected those central bank currencies by this time in the future when BTC is worth "a lot" ? unknowable.
However there is a better baseline commodity to compare to for value, something that has held its relative worth for thousands of years and that is gold. Some people think BTC could settle down at about 250oz gold per BTC.

miners reject a change by not installing the new version of the software. for pooled mining, it is the mining pool operator himself that gets to decide if the pool will support the new version of bitcoin and if he doesnt like it he can choose not to change it. on the other hand, if he does change to a stupid version and the people mining in his pool dont like it, they can leave and go start mining for a competing pool that is mining for the preferred version of the protocol.

Also, when he said he sent the btc, you could have asked for a transaction id.

if you know that the majority of the hashpower on the network has seen the version of the transaction that your customer wanted you to see, and you listen for double spend attempts and dont see any, then there is a very high chance that that the legit transaction will get into a block and it will be very low risk to let the customer walk out with the sandwich with zero confirmations.

wait, so according to this article you can do a mobile checkout from taking a picture of the product. so this seems to be a totally new concept in "checking out". Presumably if you do this to pay for an item while in the middle of the store, you would not need to stand in any regular checkout line, you would just be able to walk out of the store? What about security tags, I guess you need to still stand in that ole' checkout line anyway. And if store security staff thinks you are stealing the item? How would they know that you'd paid. Overall sounds like an interesting new experience as retail since forever has involved going up to a till, tallying up an order and paying the bill. this could totally change the whole flow of a retail experience.

The individual case here has the bitcoin seller being made aware that his customer is involved in criminal activity and then _still proceeeding_ to sell the guy bitcoins. The bitcoin seller was stupid, plain and simple. As soon as the customer mentioned illegal activity he should have cut ties and he would not be in this situation. As far as "regulatory capture" goes, bitcoin cannot be regulated any more than the wind can, so it really should be a non-issue.

Actually bitcoin refers to the cryptocurrency that started it all and "altcoin" is the generally accepted term for things that are not the original bitcoin but copy its design and change some little thing otherwise. "Cryptocurrency" is maybe the term you want, but "bitcoin" has a specific meaning here.
US Dollars, Australian Dollars, etc are not just "dollars" (Euro much??) they are "fiat currencies".
The bitcoin that suits you the most is probably the trollcoin. Get a healthy helping of premined trollcoins, throw in some quarks, check out  for a list of all the not-bitcoin "bitcoins" as you'd call them. Hrm looks like something called "Tagcoin" that I never heard of is doing well today.

transactions are broadcasted to the network and relayed among peers. presumably some nodes that are also mining will see the transaction shortly after it is broadcasted and add the transaction to its 'memory pool'. these are the transactions that should be included in the block if the miner is successful at solving it. transaction hashes are included in the merkle tree of which the root hash is going to be included in the block header.
a valid transaction can only get into one block. after that its inputs are considered 'spent'.

I don't think tax collectors will even know what they're missing. This de-funding of the nation state would be the natural consequence to the invention of crypto-currencies and other types of decentralized governance. We will find more effective and less coercive forms of government. Centralized top-down government has served us well for thousands of years. I see it as a tool for keeping a functioning society, but new tools are emerging and I think we'll be doing it better before too long.

So focus on the CC fees savings, and make your policy clear that due to exchange rate volatility risk all refunds will be in current USD value. Bitcoiners that have bitcoins and want to spend them with you are most likely already familiar with the fact that the price swings around a lot, will be happy to be able to spend with you at all. The flipside is that if the BTC rate went down then customer would get more BTC back than they had paid, volatility works both ways, and you just need to embrace the volatility not fight it, which is why you need to simply peg to USD at this time. Maybe if USD becomes the more volatile unit you could flip that around, heh.

some people around here have low tolerance for newbies who haven't done their reading. the shortest yet fairly accurate answer to your question that I can think of is that there is no way to reverse the history that the blockchain ledger records, and only the person with access to the keys that control the bitcoins in question can make them move from where they are now.
the only real way to reverse a transaction is to have the person with control of the funds voluntarily (or, you know, via intimidation and/or violence) reverse it.

the majority of the hashpower could choose to switch to classic right after a difficulty adjustment. that way the losing chain becomes really hard to build on top of with high difficultly and cratering hashpower, taking a really long time for each new very full 1MB block to come out. maybe so little hashpower remains on the small blocks blockchain that the 2016 blocks required to next difficulty adjust just never get mined, since there isnt much point in bothering when there is a totally viable alternative where all the existing coins can still be used!
In this scenario i guess the 2MB chain coins stay as whatever people call "Bitcoin", and the 1MB chain coins go to zero, because their ledger is effectively sealed.

if you had coins on the exchange when the hardfork happened you might only get to withdraw coins from the 2mb blocks fork of the chain. that transaction that they broadcast to do your withdrawal might not be also valid on the 1MB chain, because it might involve outputs that only exist in 2MB blocks chain. so if you wanted a valid transaction to move your coins out onto the 1MB chain that might need a different transaction. "Your coins" on the exhcange are just whatever outputs the exchange decides to use when processing your withdrawal, as your balance there is really just an entry in their database.

neither will be compatible with one another.

the thing i'm talking about only makes sense if there is still some new block production/hashpower working on the old chain and if the exchange produces a withdrawal transaction that has some inputs that only exist on the 2mb-blocks chain. But then their accounting would be messed up, if they've given you stuff that only works on 2mb-blocks-chain they can't just come up with other outputs for you that work on 1mb-chain, now that I think about it more ... well they could but why would they when they've satisfied your withdrawal.
i think if you wanted to be sure that whatever withdrawal transaction they sent out for you would work on both versions of the chain they would have to make sure it only involved inputs that were valid on both chains, which hopefully would be easy for them to do for a a little while anyway. its all probably pointless and not worth the effort though since it does seem to be a really limited and unlikely use case where it might be needed.

I like to think that Bitcoin will be able to stay ahead of the curve but I'll be happy if anything at all is able to replace national currencies as the go-to means of doing business for everyday people.

so who has a version that has 256MB block size max because I want to run a node that does that. I need windows 64 bit binary please (no way in am I dealing with dependency-hell and attempting to set up a build environment for myself on windoze).
I dont care if my client relays a 256MB block and I dont care if miners mine one. I would hope that miners would see that building on a chain with a block like that at this time is counterproductive and ignore such blocks in favor of mining on top of smaller alternative chains, but I dont really care that much. Lets get binaries with stupidly high limits out there and see what miners do. Fuck the debate, lets see what software people want to run.

Bitcoins are tangible in the sense that the ledger entries and keys that control them really exist in the form of organized information. They generally are not, however, corporeal in the physical sense. I've also heard it argued that bitcoin has no intrinsic value, however I don't subscribe to such arguments as I believe that there is no such thing as intrinsic value and that all value is subjective.

do you think there should be any block size limit at all? do you think if the block size was removed that miners would mine on top of attack sized blocks and allow them to remain in the main chain? and if they did could you accept that if thats what the hashpower wants then thats what bitcoin becomes?
@_date: 2015-07-04 23:11:03
yup and miners that mined on top of attack-sized blocks will create orphans unless the majority of the hashpower wants spam attack blocks to be in the main chain. ... and if they DO then i guess thats what the fuck bitcoin becomes. and maybe thats OK for the occasional 1GB block if miners want to mine on top of it!!

blockchain exists on every full node. you start up the app, it finds some peers via dns seeds to start with, then once connected to some of those can get more peer info. the app can attempt to punch a hole in the firewall with upnp but if you reach out and talk to some peers from the dns seed lists you should be able to transact. when you braodcast the transaction to any peers, they will relay it, a miner(s) will receive it and include it in the next block if they are feeling nice. then your recipient can see that the transaction is confirmed. your recipient will also likely receive a unconfirmed relay of your transaction within seconds of you sending it off to some peers.

because I like having choices. I like knowing that if bitcoin goes down the shitter because of whatever reason that there could be various other functional alternatives that people could start using. I would love bitcoin to be "the one" but i'd like to also have other options in case it doesnt work out. also in the history of evolution and whatnot there are usually quite a number of diverse creatures participating in the ecosystem that all find niches and make the whole thing work, and i'm fine if that happens with crypto currencies. my main motivation is i want to see people choose to not use central bank fiat currencies in their day to day lives and so lots of choices of non-national currencies to use seems fine to me. apps will make converting between various cryptos invisible and painless, people wont even need to know what underlies the value transfers they are performing.

The bizarre global civilization that will arise out of this will operate well with Bitcoin and only after the freedoms and benefits of a bitcoin based money society are fully realized will there ever be critical mass enough to take it to that whole nother level and do the pure mutual credit thing.

However, China country is a nationstate with a central bank and a very authoritarian central government that tends to kill you if they dont like what you are doing. using bitcoin in a place like that could be unwise. after all, bitcoin undermines the very existence of the peoples bank of china and the republic can't exist without that.

nope. the point of mining is not to make your transaction go faster. and your tiny addition to the mining power will not have any meaningful effect. your mining should be based on a business decision of whether your mining income is higher than your mining costs. if the answer is yes you should be mining, if the answer is no, you should stop.

Sure bitcoin can replace any central bank. It is poised to anyway, slowly over time. In 20 years people will laugh at the idea of central banking as they conduct all their transactions with decentralized p2p public-ledger money similar to Bitcoin. The problem is though, central banking is one half of the main means by which a "Country" asserts its dominance over a people or territory. (the other half being the armed thugs they pay to carry out the dirty work using said central bank money) ... so essentially if a country's people start using only Bitcoin, the very concept of that country even being a country is in jeopardy. Which might be a good thing if you happen to not really believe in the idea of countries any more.

if you're concerned that your pc will be the first one to broadcast a transaction to a known 'bad guy address' or something, there are ways to send your transaction out over Tor instead of plain internet, in which case you can skip the anonymizing so long as you havent somehow attached your slave number to the bitcoin address you are using.

the topic mentions "bail outs" as in, a money funnel from the central bank to some institution. bitcoin doesnt have a central bank, and nothing in the bitcoin space will be bailed out except perhaps by a collective effort of charity by those who give a crap. the whole idea of a bail-out is some top-down kind of thing that wont happen in bitcoin land. and the point is that as bitcoin takes off, the very idea of having a central bank will go away. and without a functioning central bank the idea of a nation state becomes somewhat tenuous.

Abe88's original text: (from 
Bitcoin is a protocol designed around a ledger that lists all bitcoin addresses and balances. A bitcoin address is a pair of numbers, one is listed in the ledger, the other number is kept private and used to send money from the address.
Computers hosting the ledger listen for balance transfers and compete to write the transfers to the ledger. The competition takes shape in a lottery where processing power buys tickets.
About every ten minutes a computer wins the lottery then the transfers they've collected go into a file and are written to the ledger. Additionally, fifty new bitcoin are created and credited to the winner's address.
The file the winner created containing the transfers is shared throughout the network so hosts can put the transfers in their ledger and begin a new lottery for upcoming transfers.

It is more dependant on factors like how many different transactions from your wallet it would have to use to assemble the amount(s) you want to send. If you have to compile 1000 small transaction inputs to make your large transaction that would be more data than if you only had to assemple 1 or 10 transaction inputs to do the same transaction. So it really depends on the history of your wallet addresses and how they've been used by you to receive funds.

I think if the Bitcoin system lasts the hundred years it will need to last to even get to the point of no-block-reward, where the transaction fees might matter, these problems will be solved by then. And if there is only ever 21 million BTC and again the system is still alive in 100 years and some not insignificant percentage of humans still use the system, then I think its reasonable to imagine that a single satoshi might actually be worth something and be considered a ridiculously large transaction fee and the developers might need to add more decimal places for even smaller subdivisions for even smaller viable tx fees. I'm curious to see what will happen with the live system when the block reward gets halved at the end of this year. I suspect the only side effect will be a nearly instant doubling in the market price of the BTC all other things being equal.
@_date: 2012-06-04 21:52:36
I predict that if the system doesn't get destroyed by external factors that the price will be at $10+ the day the block reward halves, probably with a slow rampup to that level since the market is aware that the block reward will be halving, and can very much price it in on our way to that.

not really sure how it works. i believe the miner who mines the block would have to include it in the block or can arbitrary messages be encoded into transactions that any miner can cram in a block for you? Could be some interesting 'extensions' to bitcoin if anyone could add custom info to any transaction they are signing and broadcasting. i need to learn more i think about the technicalities of the transactions

none of the fundamentals have changed recently so ... there is no reason for it to rocket up. the only thing that makes sense for price increase without some obvious new source of demand is the market pricing in the halving of the block reward come december. which would put us at a required price of about $10 by then to satisfy demand. current price levels seem too high too soon, so i wouldnt bet on them lasting at this level until at least december. probably will bounce around between 6 and 10 until then. maybe if say a large file locker, or a popular casino started accepting them, that would be impetus for new demand but for now ... i think its just some people with money getting into bitcoin for the first time and pushing the price up temporarily.

the short version of the explanation here is, if it can be reversed, it cannot be used to buy bitcoins. Why? Because too many people have been defrauded out of their bitcoins by scammers using reversible payment methods. Case closed.
Bitinstant is a faster way of getting cash into an exchange for pretty low fee, or you do the dwolla thing generally. Me, I'm in Canada so I do a cash bank deposit directly to the cavirtex exchange and then execute a buy order. Real fast that way but can't deposit cash on Sunday lol.

just coins that are controlled by the new addresses which are not included in the backup will be unavailable if you restored from that backup. you could forward funds to an address that you know is in the backup for convenience. overwriting newer wallet with older one would lead to loss of any coins controlled by newer addresses from the newer wallet. i believe if you use a deterministic wallet like electrum then you only need to do one backup because any new keys will always be predictable from the wallet 'seed' (or so i understand)

Thank you. Your musing about a track on a Tiesto mix made me think of a track I have that I hadnt listened to in a while nor could I remember the name of. So I dug through my music collection for an hour looking for the mix with the track. Finally found it. Then thought to myself "golly I'm glad I have a backup of all this music" and decided maybe I should double check my backup works. WHOA NOW dead backup hard disk! Ran off to FutureShop and bought a 3TB external disk and come home to do backups again. Phew. And I wouldn't have bothered even checking integrity of that old backup disk today if it wasnt for YOU.

armory is neato. I played with it a bit to test the idea of creating a new address and exporting the private key in base58 text. this way i can send bitcoin to an address and then hand someone a piece of paper with the private key. they can then input that into their armory and take control of that bitcoin. so papercash transaction possibilities. i totally got it to work as well :D but the memory footprint of 2.5GB due to the alpha-nature of the current release and the fact that it seems to only know about whatever the most recent block that the satoshi client had when armory started up, makes it a little unwieldly right now.

supply and demand economics suggests that when the block reward is zero, the only transactions a miner will bother to include will have some transaction fee. the marketplace of miners willing to include transactions in blocks will adjust the "price" of having your transaction included in a block through some kind of competition. someone who is willing to include a fee higher than the market average will probably have their transaction included in a block faster than someone who does not do this.

I've done so a few times. I did it in the past before they jacked their fees. I did once do a bill payment to fund my account, but now they require "verification" to do that. Last time I checked they do NOT require "verification" for you to deposit cash via RBC (or other banks they allow) into their account to fund your account. RBC asks you if you have an account and you should be able to say "no" and deposit cash without presenting any identification.

Decentralized payment networks on top of bitcoin implies having to trust new 3rd parties. I prefer my transactions to be in the blockchain directly, that way there are no shenanigans. Mining pools and exchanges are probably the only ones that will _need_ to run full nodes. Anyone else would be free to but realistically when bitcoin is the worlds reserve currency and also has replaced all value transfer services like western union etc. the transaction volume will be huge with people that still only want their tx in the blockchain, regardless of whether 3rd party services/payment networks on top of bitcoin become successful or not.

its a WAG number based on the amount of above-ground gold vs the amount of potential bitcoins that will exist. 10oz is super-conservative, it could go to 200oz gold per bitcoin. if you wanted to value the entirety of all the gold in the world as being about equal to the value of the entirety of all the bitcions that will exist, 4billion oz of gold divided by 21M bitcoins = ~200oz per bitcoin.

the hash that qualifies as a solution has to be a valid hash of the data in that block .. so no they can't just reuse the block hashes because those block hashes dont match their forgery data. ... block hash is computed from the data (transactions) in the block, including the pay-myself-50-bitcoins-out-of-nothing transaction, and the nonce (just a number to add to try new for new hashes with), and the end result hash must be below the difficulty number at the time in order to be considered valid.
@_date: 2012-08-02 01:33:55
your transaction is too big, too many things going in or out, and so you have to pay a fee based on the how many. the miner gets it for bothering to include your big transaction in his block.

Yes because if you want to BUY the captcha solve service you pay no less than $1.35 per 1k solutions (if you know someone selling @ cheaper then I WANT TO KNOW NOW) and the slave laborers that do the typing get between $0.8 and $1.2 of that. So if you can pay the workers more than $1.2 and at the same time sell to the buyers for less than $1.35, you can enjoy the $0.15 per 1k all to yourself. I'd code it buy I'm very busy.

Bitcoin isnt something you really use to buy stuff right now, the same way you dont really buy stuff with Gold or Silver. Around the time you see people buying new cars with gold bars, you'll see Bitcoin used for a lot more stuff too, because it has obvious advantages over Gold. But right now, with Greshams law in full effect, there are a boat-ton of crappy federal reserve and other central bank shitpaper out there chasing after goods, and until that money supply dries up we wont see Bitcoin or gold or silver or anything _other than_ central bank shitpaper used for conducting all that many transactions.

there is already a reputable venue for exchanging canadian national currency into and out of bitcoins ... cavirtex is the name of it.
'canadian tire' money is something completely different, it's issued debt-free by a corporation and tied in value to the canadian dollar. they are like coupons you get when you buy something from that store with cash or debit (I think as a way of saying, "thank you for not incurring credit card fees on us"). I shop there from time to time and do collect the canadian tire money notes (i have a 5c one on my desk right now, lol), and so I could see myself totally taking advantage of turning them into bitcoins instead of using them at canadian tire. Canadian Tire probably wont take too kindly to this new unexpected usage as they'd previously asked some other people who started accepting them to stop ... but good luck suing someone who only deals in bitcoins to stop, lol!

the blockchain is hosted by all nodes. it is the ledger. it shows the origin of every bitcoin and what private keys hold what bitcoins currently. only the person with the private key for any given account can forward the bitcoins that are held by that account to another key. if you are able to hack someones laptop and get a copy of their unencrypted wallet.dat file then you'll have access to whatever bitcoins the keys in that wallet.dat control. if the person with the laptop was not stupid, they would have encrypted their wallet and/or taken other methods to avoid being hacked/robbed.

I like calling it an experiment. An experimental super-ledger. With the potential to end central banking forever. Encrypt your wallet if you run a desktop client or use 2 factor auth for an online wallet like blockchain.info (&lt;-- probably easiest to get started with, that or coinbase.com). Not a short term thing, long term and still quite risky. Not advised to put more than 5% of your savings into it at this time. Unless you like big risky crazy awesome.

totally but its kind of hard for me to do work remotely for someone under a pseudonym for cash. they'd have to mail it or something. slow, painful, could get robbed by a postal worker etc. instant value transfers worldwide with ability to hide asset is why the genie is out of the bottle. and like you said it can't be inflated by a central bank so it actually (can) holds its purchasing power. if enough people decided they felt like not funding government any more by using bitcoin for everything and keeping the books encrypted, there is not much i can see government doing about it. 
central banks have been destroying currencies for as long as they've existed. also the whole 'income tax' shit is a relatively new thing anyway ... and now pretty much can be defeated. thats why this is special because gold and silver aren't going to be efficient enough to work with to destroy central banking .. too easy to counterfeit (tungsten filled bars, etc) and difficult to secure and spend in an efficient way.

Tor+instawallet should be pretty good, but you've got the problem of the exit node from tor to the clearnet which could be malicious and feed you modified javascript. now if you had a hash of the proper javascript source code before hand and could compare that to a hash of the code for the site you got over tor, and as long as the hashes match then yeah you should be golden. i'm not sure how easy it is to do this but if you could generate your transaction completely offline and then somehow use some kind of tor hidden service to broadcast your already prepared transaction, that i think would be the ultimate means of being nearly 100% completely anonymous without too much effort. (but i dont know if the tools for that exist yet)

From 
Author information and Datestamp not appearing in original article either.
Virtual economy looms as digital cash grows up
IF THE price of gold halved overnight while the cost of mining equipment ballooned, the global economy would be plunged into chaos. This scenario is about to play out in the online peer-to-peer currency Bitcoin, but rather than disrupting the digital money supply, it could be what Bitcoin needs to be taken seriously.
Bitcoin is maturing rapidly. Last week blog host Wordpress.com announced it will now accept Bitcoins, adding blog themes to the list of things you can use the currency to buy online, which already includes T-shirts, jewellery and illegal drugs.
Bitcoin has no central bank or authority. Instead users running the Bitcoin software form a decentralised network that processes transactions. At the same time, their computers attempt to be the first to calculate the results of a difficult and regularly changing puzzle and so receive a small amount of Bitcoins as a reward (see "How to be a Bitcoin miner"). These can then be spent or converted into cash. The process is called mining because of its similarity to striking gold.
The mining reward was initially set at 50 Bitcoins by the currency's mysterious creator, the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, but to prevent inflation it is designed to halve every four years until the total number of Bitcoins is fixed at just under 21 million, double the current number in circulation. It is impossible to predict exactly when this "halving day" will take place as it depends on the computing power of the Bitcoin network, although it is thought that the first is due on 29 November.
No one is sure what the effect of halving will be, but with 1 Bitcoin currently valued at around $11, miners look set to take a significant hit to their profits unless the exchange rate adjusts.
"Seeing what happens to the price of Bitcoin will be interesting," says Gavin Andresen, lead developer of the Bitcoin software. "Everybody knows when it's going to happen, so if we assume everybody is purely rational, economic models tell you that nothing will happen because everybody will have already anticipated that change."
Another looming shake-up complicates matters, however. Calculating the Bitcoin algorithm is like entering a lottery and the more powerful your computer, the more tickets you get. Early adopters simply used the central processing unit of an ordinary desktop computer, but mid-2010 saw a shift to using more powerful graphical processing units (GPU). The Bitcoin algorithm is designed to adjust to changes in the computing power of the Bitcoin network by altering its difficulty every two weeks, equivalent to changing the odds of the lottery, which keeps the supply of new coins roughly stable.
But these GPUs will soon be outclassed by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). As the name suggests, this is hardware designed to do just one thing: compute the Bitcoin mining algorithm. "They are the endpoint of Bitcoin mining," says Josh Zerlan of Butterfly Labs in Kansas City, Missouri, one of a number of firms promising to bring ASICs to market before the end of the year.
Many worry that a limited supply of ASICs will allow a cabal to take control of the Bitcoin network. But the true impact of ASICs plus the halving might be to dissuade those running Bitcoin on cobbled-together computers for spare change, making the currency a more professional endeavour, which is therefore more attractive to business. "A lot of people see Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme," says Zerlan. "I see mining becoming a professional activity."
If that happens, a lot of people who bought cheap GPUs to get in on the currency's gold rush will be looking for another way to make money. CoinLab, a Seattle-based startup, wants to exploit that. The plan is to take advantage of the unused GPUs by paying their owners - in Bitcoins or other currency - for their computing power, and then sell it on to those who need cheap access to number crunching. "We are providing something good for the world to do with all these GPUs," explains Peter Vessenes, CoinLab CEO and executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation.
The fact that companies like Butterfly Labs and CoinLab want to make money from Bitcoin shows that it is becoming more stable and reliable, says Andresen. "The surrounding infrastructure is really starting to mature, and I'm seeing a lot more well-funded projects as opposed to fly-by-night outfits who maybe shouldn't be involved in the financial transaction world."
Even the European Central Bank has taken interest, last month publishing a report on virtual currencies. It says such currencies will have little impact on real-world financial stability for now, but if the popularity of Bitcoin and its ilk increase, central banks may have to start regulating them.
That is unlikely to go down well with Bitcoin's libertarian supporters, but could help wider adoption, says Elli Androulaki, a security researcher at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. "For Bitcoin to be valuable, banks will have to get involved."
Widespread use could threaten another Bitcoin trait: anonymity. Although Bitcoin transaction records are public, there is nothing that links a Bitcoin address, where coins are stored, to an individual. When Androulaki's team simulated the use of Bitcoin in a real-world setting they discovered that the timings and amounts of regular purchases - a cup of coffee every morning, say - could be used to link addresses in 40 per cent of cases, thus revealing the total number of Bitcoins in a user's possession. This doesn't immediately give away their identity, but if one address has been linked to a person in a public setting, the rest can be linked to them as well.
Clearly, Bitcoin still has a long way to go before it gets anywhere near the mainstream, but it is doing well for such a young currency. "I still tell people Bitcoin is an experiment, so don't invest time or money that you can't afford to lose," says Andresen. "I'm hoping a year from now I can stop telling people that."
How to be a Bitcoin miner
The Bitcoins that make up the virtual currency are stored under a unique alphanumeric sequence called an address. To make a purchase, users transfer coins from one address to another. Details of that and other transactions are then broadcast to the Bitcoin network for inclusion in the public record, which is what makes the transaction official.
New sets of transactions, known as blocks, are only added to the public record when a user's computer crunches the numbers to solve a complex puzzle, which gets easier or harder to solve depending on the computational power of the network. It is designed so new blocks are generated roughly every 10 minutes.
The person whose computer solves the puzzle receives a reward, currently 50 Bitcoins, injecting new money into the currency, which they can then spend and start the cycle again.

I'm happy to pay to play and live in the glorious city that I live in and have access to all it affords.

small and simple, sure, might introduce some people to it. For a while I was writing anti-central banking and pro-bitcoin slogans and stuff on banknotes, usually on the figurehead's forehead or in a speech bubble produced by them. Sometimes I would insult the notion of "Canada" on the bills too and scratch it out and replace with the word "Garbage" (Bank of Garbage) etc. Just silly/childish/angry things mostly depending on my mood when looking at the notes in my hand.

Bitcoin cuts out middle men. We can loan our bitcoins to business or crowd-fund worthwhile endeavors on our own and cut the bank and its spread right out of the deal. Also further to your original argument, I dont think a central bank is acting in my interest, I don't want it managing or having any say on the money supply or interest rates, and I'll be happy to see the idea of central banking (and nationalism) buried in the past where it belongs.

just change it so "while some consider it a ponzi scheme [dead link citation] others [link to ponzi scheme article] would disagree in that a ponzi scheme by definition is run by a central agent [citation to history of ponzi schemes that did this] who promises a return on investment [citation to list of ponzies that promised a return] and bitcoin satisfies neither of those accepted criteria."

something like that yarr. no debt though. just basically signing over control of existing coins. new coins come into existence through the block rewards of the mining process, issued debt-free from nothingness (there is no input to block reward transactions) unto the successful miner.

In order to lend bitcoins you have to actually have bitcoins. If you can't re-title them to your borrower because you depleted your reserves of deposits, you cannot lend what you do not have. What you _can_ do is lend out your depositors bitcoins to a borrower at a higher interest rate than you are paying your depositors. But you still have to hope that your depositors don't all come at once demanding their deposits, because if you lent them all out you won't have them to return to the depositors!

I think it will take more than a hack at a website and some stolen keys to take down the Bitcoin. More like, the bitcoin system will march on and central banking and nationalism will fall by the wayside.

1) they look up the address on blockchain.info, or if you only use addresses once then its a mystery to everyone how much you really control. its kind of hard to assert that you really control any bitcoin address unless they have a copy of your wallet with exposed keys.
2) dunno i think there is a program called ABE for blockchain inspection and data mining otherwise you write some code to do it yeah.
3) encrypt it and your private keys are safe on disk. yes back it up. keep the backup fresh as your new transactions will create new keys that will need to be in your backups.
4) "hackers" or insiders took copies of unencrypted wallets and swept funds out. not a bitcoin problem, more a PEBKAC issue.
5) up? more use cases for bitcoin and more people using it for those use cases. down? breaking the encryption or other fundamentals or perhaps if some amazingly innovative new alternative open source digital currency system was released that blew the socks off bitcoin somehow (i dont see it happening in the next 40 years).
6) anyone operating any business anywhere that is a normal, profitable business that also accepts bitcoin. i accept bitcoin. do you accept bitcoin?
7) it was a stock exchange. buy and sell virtual equities (or some such, i never did it lol). some things on there were apparently actually not scams.
8) bitfloor is supposedly an exchange like any other exchange. load your account with USD or BTC and use it to buy or sell USD or BTC with other users who have matching buy or sell orders in the system. Presumably (i've never actually used it.)
9) SHA256 hashing and ECDSA encryption. Military grade. plus plus.
10) yes, highly unrealistic considering even if the internet gets shut off the block chain can be etched in stone and sneakernets can shuttle around usb sticks with the latest transaction data. any attempts to make bitcoin illegal will result in streisandification.

any economist who subscribes to keynesian theories is by definition not a smart economist. the question of whether people will hoard their bitcoins instead of spending them relies on whether or not greshams law is in effect, and right now greshams law is in full effect with shitty crap like FRNs and Euros being readily accepted by merchants all over the world. In such situations yes people will and should hoard their bitcoins and get rid of their lesser forms of money for day to day transactions. Should the lesser forms disappear from the market, then Bitcoin will be used for day to day things, deflation be damned. The great thing about a deflationary currency is the fact that there is no need to charge interest on loans as the value of the repaid amount will be higher in the future even though the numbers of units stays the same.

this is a good and accurate visual description of how the process flow works and the pieces that come together to create a transaction and put it in a block.

I buy Bitcoins and then give away mBTC to things I like. This is all to be done before the central bank fiat money hyperinflation thats set to start steamrolling sometime in the next 48 months (could start tomorrow). When that gets underway Bitcoin will suffer a hyper-DEflation as people start to realize that Bitcoin is unstoppable and kicks the ass of form of money ever invented before.

i prefer to use a higher powered rfid reader system that you can embed in a door frame that has a lot of traffic moving through it. that way you dont have to be so close to the rfid chip to read it, its far less obvious that you are being scanned, and we get a LOT of cardz in a short time. Can tear down and set up elsewhere quickly and easily too and runs for hours on standard lipoly cellphone batteries. 
But I digress, this actually has shit fuck all to do with Bitcoin and much more to do with idiotic system designers that think encoding personal financial access information into freely readable rfid chips is a good idea.
We had to shut down operations in Canada since all Canadian cardmakers re-issued non-rfid cards (chip and pin) to their customers and shit like paypass is cancelled due to this security failbag.

Isnt the BFL stuff using discontinued chips that the only reason they could sell for that cheap is because they are buying up old stocks .. and now they can't get any more old stocks of those chips at those prices and so they arent shipping any more units .. likely ever? and also their bitstream for the BFL forces you to run through their centralized system and mine in a pool of their choosing so they can skim a small amount of mined BTC that your equipment mined?

na ... government needs to ban bitcoin for many reasons. number one is that it threatents their very existence. number two is that when they try to fight it, it will give bitcoin stupidly high amounts of publicity. number three, as with everything else they try to suppress, the outcome will be twofold: utter failure on their part (as with the war on some drugs), and the jacking up of the price of bitcoins (again, as with the war on some drugs). So overall, government trying to fight bitcoin is good for bitcoin. in the end bitcoin wins and nationalism falls down as a stupid idea that we dont need anymore.

Bitcoin is more of a diamond. It has a pointy end on more than one side, where it can randomly be used to jab central bankers in the eye. And like a diamond it will require much pressure to release the remaining 12 million bitcoins into the environment. I wonder, will people demand only bitcoins minted after the reward halving? Because those would be "harder" bitcoins and rarer and thus perhaps worth more? Or will it show itself to be truly fungible where old, easy bitcoins are just as good as new harder bitcoins? Only the free marketplace can decide these things.

theres only 9 million bitcoin in existence and the price is determined purely by free market supply and demand factors, not anyones intentions other than everyone acting in their own interests. if a rich mofo decided he wanted bitcoins he could move the price up hugely overnight just with a single massive buy. ... i think these recent price movements is just the market pricing in the fact that the rate of supply will cut in half by december and thus the price needs to double to so that supply can meet demand at that time. i think the correction will overshoot a little past 14 and then come back down to 10-12 by jan. thats my guess lol.

you dont need to dive into bitcoin all at once. gold and silver have a very long history of use as money, those are the safest bets for long term value storage, given the history. But bitcoins are great for fast electronic value transfers. So, you should probably store most of your wealth in a diversified portfolio including precious metals, bitcoins and whatever else you think might be good, and use all these things as you see fit. I think bitcoins being accepted at retail in general will be a wonderful thing. If you decided to buy 50 million dollars worth today, you will move the market and push the price up significantly if you do it too fast :)

you wont be borrowing anonymously. the lender needs to know where you sleep so he can come enforce the contract if required. If you don't want to reveal that, good luck finding someone willing to lend to you. as for those that ARE borrowing and you want to understand the lenders business model? Its pretty simple, give depositors a lower interest rate on their savings, and demand a higher rate on loans made to borrowers. The difference is the profit.
@_date: 2012-06-01 00:03:11
the very fact that he wont disclose his business model leads us to believe there is something scammy going on. even if its not scammy, whatever market inefficiencies it must exploit cannot be sustainable in the long run and as soon as he is disintermediated he will not have a business. he wont share his business model because he doesnt want to be disintermediated right away!
i dont think he's actually producing any good, or performing any real service, so he is not generating any real wealth. likely operating as some kind of middleman parasite type thing and when people figure out however to get what he does for free they will do so and he'll have to find something else to do.

if everyone decided to use bitcoin, everyone could avoid paying taxes by reporting no income and it would be near impossible to prove in a court that someone is hiding bitcoin ownership/earnings. bitcoins can't be stolen by force when properly encrypted/secured/hidden. so if everyone stops paying for the state in this way, the state runs out of money and dies.

i would encrypt it into a truecrypt volume or something like that before uploading, but otherwise there is really no concern. if you just use the built-in encryption of bitcoin-qt client that should also be pretty safe from someone being able to use that wallet to spend your coins, however i understand that the builtin encryption exposes the public keys in your wallet which could be used to identify transactions you might have been party to. which is why i suggest using external encryption as well.

copying information is not a crime. breaking into someones computer to copy information is the crime you would be charged with. the fact that what you stole was keys to bitcoins may or may not play a role in any legal proceedings. i'd like to think the fact that you stole something that is recognized to have value similar to money would be taken into consideration in any legal proceedings, but IANAL. if you copied the wallet.dat and the guy looks at it and says "everything is exactly where i left it" then you didnt steal anything ... yet. it then becomes a race between you and him as to who forwards the coins to themselves. if he doesnt know he's been hacked, then you can forward them to yourself at your leisure. if he moves his money around a lot, you'd want to send the coins to an address only you control, quickly, to complete your theft.

mining pools and exchanges could very well make up a significant portion of the full network nodes that mirror ALL transactions.

there should be a private key on it, under a hologram or sticker or something. somehow, and sorry i dont have specifics i've never did it, only know its possible -- anyway, somehow you can input that private key to your bitcoin client software or an online-wallet type tool and use it to claim the bitcoins controlled by that private key, and transfer them to a bitcoin address/key of your choosing.

dont you have to go through THEIR servers to mine with them as well? that alone sounds sketchy as hell.
Edit: I can't find the source on that. Other threads I'm reading about a guy setting one up to mine in btcguild with cgminer with this bitforce single, so i guess i'm wrong, and not sure where i got that idea in the first place.

yes. Bitcoin is deflationary by design. Thats not a bad thing. It means you get paid "interest" so to speak simply by holding it because it should be worth more as supply remains constant but demand goes up. Thankfully the 8 decimal places of divisibility is just for now, it can be further divided as the need arises :)

weird. I take payouts from my client to the tune of USD$3.5k per month on my personal paypal, and also often end up handling business expense stuff with forwarded monies to the tune of another $1k or so per month. So far no probs with paying large (&gt;$500) payments for services from my personal paypal. Although I did do the bank-account verification process, may have a bearing on it. Also I am in Canada, if that matters. Anyway I hope my client can soon start paying me partly in Bitcoin. Hahahaha.

The blockchain is what, 1.5 gigs? so 10 minutes it should take to download on a high 15mbit speed connection ... but it seems to take my clients a lot longer than that.

at present, the best you can do is claim that you do not recall the passphrase required to unlock the wallet. or you have a 'decoy' wallet that is in the obvious place with a some pocket change that you can give up instead of being shot over a poor memory and instead have the motherload stored in a hidden wallet.dat file that is also encrypted with a different passphrase and its not sitting in the filesystem in an obvious place the theif would look. theres really a lot of plausible deniability with anything to do with bitcoin and encryption, so really this kind of robber scenario can be jam packed full with as many lulz as you are prepared to prepare for.

I have no experience in that arena so I can't really say. I mean theoretically, I dont see why not. Get sufficient amperage power supply to the facility where it will run, possibly can cool itself in winter but will need some serious energy devoted to cooling in the summer.
And when you said electricity was low I was thinking zero. But if you have to pay the electricity in any capacity, it could very well turn out that the old GPUs burn more electricity than they generate in bitcoin. you'll need to run the numbers for what the particular cards are. Its sounding dubious now and you might do a lot better to use the $ to buy newer equipment that can actually turn a profit when there is a nonzero electricity cost.

bitcoins are entries in the public ledger. your wallet contains the crypto keys needed to transfer them to someone else. most people that have bitcoins do not want credit card transactions because of potential fraud due to the fact that credit card transactions can be reversed. if you find someone however (and i hear quickbitcoins takes cc) ... when you buy $65 worth of bitcoins from someone (or on an exchange) the seller is making an entry in the ledger that re-titles those $65 worth of bitcoin to a key that you control. now they're yours. dont lose the keys. ;) (there are different ways of backing them up depending on which type of wallet you choose to use)

i agree with this. i'm of the mind that any major problems discovered in the bitcoin system will be found and resolved by bitcoin stakeholders without having to start a new project. but a new project could just come along and attract users away, but presumably this other system would have to be 'better' in ways that make it even more resilient than bitcoin, enabling all the same thing that bitcoin is enabling.

All businesses should be able to make a 2 to 3% profit. So the price of mining a bitcoin will be 3% less than what you can sell it for on the market. From now until bitcoin dies. It will fluctuate a bit, but on average, 3% profit. Thats what I say.

{Bitcoin is|Crypto-currencies use|Decentralized money uses} a {protocol|system} designed around {a ledger|a transaction history|an ever-growing public record} that lists all bitcoin addresses and balances. A bitcoin address is a pair of {numbers|digital keys|cryptographic keys}, one is listed {in the ledger|in the transaction repository|publicly on the internet}, the other {number|key|identifier|piece} is kept {private|hidden|secret|secured privately|away from public eyes} and used to {send money|send currency units|execute title transfers} from one address to another.
{Computers|Machines|Devices|Smartphones|Pirateboxes|Meshnodes} hosting the {ledger|transaction history|public record} {listen for|receive|record|take note of|store} balance transfers and compete to {write|encode|insert} the transfers into the {ledger|transaction history|public record}. The competition takes {shape in|the form of} a lottery where {processing power buys|GPU cycles buy|SHA256 crunching buys|computer performance buys|hashing power buys} tickets.
{About|Roughly|Approximately} every {ten minutes|six hundred seconds} a {computer|machine|device|GPU|processor} wins the lottery and then the value transfers {they've {collected|noted|recently seen|been exposed to}|they care to include} go into a {file|datagram|packet|collection|bundle} with other recent tranfers and are written to the {ledger|transaction history|public record}. {Additionally|At the same time|In addition|Furthermore}, fifty new {bitcoin|currency units} are {created|spawned|forged|discovered|revealed|granted} and credited to the winner's address.
The {file|datagram|block} that the winner created containing the new transfers is {shared|sent|posted|made available|fired off|repeated|mirrored|passed} throughout the network so {hosts|machines|devices|computers|nodes} can put the transfers in their copy of the {ledger|transaction history|public record} and begin a new lottery for {any upcoming|the next {batch|group|bunch} of} transfers.

i think its good in the sense that it will put the idea of bitcoin into far more minds. some percentage of these newcomers will take the effort to understand the functioning of the system, which is good for the overall critical mass required for mass adoption to take place. i think its bad in that its a little sad that many peoples first introduction to bitcoin will be from this sillyness. i'm confident government won't figure out how to stop bitcoin (without shutting off the internet) until its far too late for them to do anything but join in mining and benefit from block rewards ;)

if you created a new wallet without backing up the old one the old one is quite possibly lost. i'm not really that familiar with multibit, but it should be able to show you the addresses it knows about for receiving and if the address you used to get the free coins is not listed in it then it wont be able to access them. normally transactions should show up instantly and then be allowed to be spend after 10 minutes or so (after 1 confirmation)

give it time I suppose. only 7200 new coins were created per day before, now 3600 ... but more than 7200 have typically been being sold daily, so its not just "new" supply being sold. Miners might want to hoard coins until the price rises to the point where it covers their mining costs, or just get out of the mining game, depending on how they think things will go.

prior deflations involved unit scarcity. when a penny is the smallest unit and its actually worth something, they disappear from the marketplace and there is no money circulating. but bitcoins solve this by being theoretically infinitely divisible and currently 8decimal places divisible in implementation. when a single satoshi is actually worth something then we'll need to allow more than 8 decimal places but for now and the near future the current divisibility should avoid any deflationary evacuation of money supply from the marketplace.

Bitcoin is going to make the concept of a national government obsolete since a) there will come a day when coercion to pay tax simply stops working and b) they wont be able to forcibly steal anyones bitcoins either. So basically nation states will run out of money and go away or become severely reduced in scope. Intellectual property will be truly a dead duck then since the enforcers of it will have shut down due to lack of funds. As for your idea of stealing bitcoins by cracking private keys, this is certainly possible, yet so difficult/improbable as to be considered only a minor threat. anyone seriously worried about their keys being cracked would simply do well to split their holdings into small pieces over multiple keys such that a compromise of any given key was a small enough loss to not worry too much about.

You are right. Initial download of the blockchain is slow as fuck and Bitcion.org could link to a weekly torrent snapshot of the complete chain that anyone with high speed coul download in 10 minutes. And then have that support in the clients built in for initial chain download. But what we have works and this is not a high priority right now, as the general focus for dealing with the block-chain-download problem is not just the time but also the space and so there is work being done on thin clients that talk to a block-chain-server as opposed to dealing with the whole block chain download in the first place.

Buy some proper hardware and be prepared for it to take months/years to pay for itself. Its very risky too because at least 3 companies are supposed to ship ASICs "soon". Assuming at least one of them does, it will be big change in difficulty. And if one of them doesnt, some one else will eventually produce a sha256 application specific integrated circuit and so if its not you producing it, and you arent buying one of those, and you arent ALREADY mining with top end GPU or FPGA, then you are taking huge risks. Might as well take the money you were going to spend on hardware and just buy some bitcoins. Theres only 10.5 million more to mine, ever.

using a 3rd party service to host your bitcoins like that you will never even see your private key and you dont give it to anyone. the 3rd party website created a private key for you, and kept it to themselves and gave you a public key by which you could fund your account or load money onto that site or whatever. the sites also let you withdraw those coins to wherever you wanted, whenever you wanted except that didnt mean much after they got hacked/ran off with the money.

you are 100% correct on that matter. to address your original concern with accepting no-confirmation transactions, i'm not sure the best solution but my idea is to only accept transactions that have been relayed by the 5 biggest mining pools (dont just trust your customer's device to relay the info). that way you can be pretty darn sure that the transaction will be included in a block before any double-spend attempt. how to implement this? I'm not sure. you'd need to know the ip's of the big mining pools and have a way to tell your bitcoin client to only listen to those peers.

without central banks dictating interest rates and money supplies there would be no such thing as the "business cycle" (Keynesian idiocy). I welcome the day when the entire central banking system comes crumbling down. It will be like humpty dumpty -- nobody will be able to put it together again, and it wont matter because of the Bitcoin. We're on a timescale of less than 10 years before that absolute and utter failing of central banking and another 7 years of hell after that while they try to do something about it. And in that time Bitcoin and general alt-currency usage will surge. When the police and military find out their pensions wont be honored, things will be rough for a while.

i think pools could do this if they wanted to, only include transactions that have fees they like. why dont they? i dont think theres really any incentive to ... it certainly wont force anyone to pay a fee as there will always be someone out there willing to mine for block reward only (for a number of years yet anyway) and i dont think there is any real advantage as a pool operator to excluding no fee transactions if they are within the expected kb size limit. but i have questions about they handle a constantly changing data set with new transactions coming in and also how that relates to changing nonce values. i think there can be a lot of dynamics in the mining process and find it fascinating to think about.

Nope. Did you find a backdoor in the code? Neither did I. Not that I'm super-pro, but also neither did the super-pros. Get a grip on the kinds of output running some data through a SHA256 produces. Then think about it more, if you want to target a certain SHA256 output, at least a result lower than some magic number. ... Thats mining. The magic number to be lower than is the difficulty, which is decided by the network rules. And how to affect the results of your hashing so you can try for that magic number? Add a nonce and change it for each attempt. Its not _that_ hard to understand in a basic sense.
Also if the hashing algo's are found to be weak at some future point, we can, and will, implement the latest greatest at that time.

(EDIT or write on the cash some base58 encoded bitcoin private key info with a note saying "double your money by using this bitcoin private key" .. and if they dont bother and just spend the note, whoever eventually gets that note and bothers to care about the bitcoin private key info written on it can be the one to claim those bitcoins .. still gets the message out so to speak)

yes the satoshi client is the one from bitcoin.org
also you should know that your client will broadcast this transaction and your ISP could maybe see that fact. You generally have plausible deniability about whether you originated the transaction or not however because the clients also relay transactions. Now beware that even with wallet encryption enabled in the satoshi client your public keys in your wallet are exposed. Theoretically law enforcement could use the fact that a valid transaction involving certain addresses was at least relayed by your network (from ISP logs), and the fact that the pc they seized from you contained a wallet file with public keys matching those involved in the questionable transaction against you. For better protection use a good VPN that wont log anything and use full disk encryption with truecrypt or similar (or at least keep your full bitcoin installation including wallet on an encrypted volume.).

bot probably got itself banned and maybe doesnt have the budget to deal with the necessary proxies and captcha bypass required to maintain such a concern on an ongoing basis. 
the user that posts the "transaction confirmed" or whatever info/spam messages needs to be dynamic, as in it needs to be able to create accounts on the fly (including solving the captcha) to post via proxy these messages because otherwise it will just get banned and stop working.
and if reddit doesnt like the private message spam that will be the user interactions with the bot, it might make more sense to do things like create and fund accounts outside of the reddit site, perhaps via an email account instead of reddit pm.
the interface between the user and the bot where one funds ones account maybe could be outside of reddit, if reddit doesnt
would need to use something stable, but that could switch to perhaps out of band means in order to with people for account funding, privately, and something different that can create accounts to do the comment spam "Transaction confirmed!" (or whatever) part.
the bot is a nice concept but i think it may have some issues with spam. maybe just notifying the sender of the tip privately. and not sure if tips can be sent privately with it either or if you have to post a public comment to cause a tip to be generated.

whichever wallet has the address you used to receive the free bitcoins is the one you'll need to watch. if you created a wallet, used an address from it, and then deleted that wallet, the coins received by the address from that now-deleted-wallet are likely unrecoverable. .. but it also sounds like you might just need to wait for the QT client to fully sync up before it shows that it has received anything. (painfully slow unfortunately, version 0.8 coming soon should help a lot with that). If you use an address from your multibit you should be able to receive them right away (due to it being a light, non-full-node client)

if everyone was using bitcoin .. and people still need to eat and repair their homes .. then some bitcoin related economic activity would still happen. prices would go down. ever smaller amounts of bitcoin would continue to circulate. savers would enjoy increased purchasing power for their stored value. all would be well and good. right now, all are not using bitcoin, and bad money will chase good out of the marketplace until bad money (central bank shitpaper) dies its horrible death that it is mathematically predetermined to eventually do

IMO Bitcoin can help build a totally awesome world, worth living in, and central banking systems are the evil usurious taint that has enslaved humanity and created the horrors of the modern world, and if we bury central banking (and this idea of things called "countries" as well) in the past, and use bitcoin to transact, it will be a really great thing. But every piece of economic or political news that could be related to bitcoin in that bitcoin can help solve the problems being discussed in the article/video/whatever, in my opinion, does not really belong here in this subreddit unless it directly mentions bitcoin. If you want general news of the type like this video, sgtreport.com is all you need to visit. I'd really like to see the subreddit here stick to things that actually make a reference to Bitcoin. ... Maybe I'm off base on that. And I do appreciate the sharing etc, just hoping to not have to wade through lots of stuff I'm already aware of looking for the bitcoin mentions.

OPs post does sound confusingly worded. I first read it as he wants to give reddit gold to someone, and he wants to do it by giving bitcoins to someone who can buy the reddit gold and give it to the person he wants to give reddit gold to. 
But it could perhaps be interpreted that the OP has reddit gold and wants to give that up in exchange for bitcoins. But then, that interpretation only makes sense if one can have reddit gold and sell it to another user, and I didn't know it worked like that.

You're not going to be able to mine for a meaningful amount of bitcoin using cpu mining any more unfortunately. ATI GPU's are still useful but the difficulty is moving such that FPGAs are currently the best way, and very soon (after they ship) only the new ASICs will be profitable. Otherwise you'll end up just spending more on increased electricity usage that you'll earn from mining.

I am not trying to be a dick here. I just want you to not have expectations that are not grounded in reality. In today's reality, people are unwilling to pay for recorded music. At least for anyone I deal with personally that is the case. So my suggestion to you is that you do what all successful musicians have to do these days to guarantee income -- live shows.
You could charge Bitcoin as admission!! And I think thats an exciting idea. You could also accept bitcoin donation on your website. But I would not try to make it where people _have_ to pay to get your recordings. Think of your recordings as promotional materials. Offer USB sticks loaded with your music for sale in Bitcoin at your live show too. :)

Because you SEE, the reason Bitcoin is taking off is BECAUSE of the exchanges like mtgox where you can turn cash into bitcoin so you can buy ILLEGAL SHIT on the silk road, etc. What else reason, other than idiot speculators, is there to actually convert fiat money into bitcoin? to buy shit you can only buy with bitcoin of course!! so there will always be a market for bitcoin as long as it is the required payment method on sites like the silk road. and so anyway as long as there is a market for bitcoin and it can be treated like money, I'll be willing to accept it :)

Ripple is an example of a mutual credit system, yes. Probably the best existing implementation that I'm aware of in fact. I'd like to see the ideas of ripple moved into the Bitcoin p2p/shared-public-ledger space. I might dedicate my life to making some such possible and a reality. Unfortunately I have 10 years of child support payment in $CAD and my landlord every bloody month wants more $CAD, so I have to spend my productive time foraging for $CAD instead of working on or thinking about cool shit. Ahh life on planet earth. Fun times :D (and this is why I'm a loser, and why I fail).

what you are doing (as far as I understand things) is adding your "pay myself 50 BTC out of nothing whee" transaction to the last block, and the nonce, and then hashing it. and if the hash is a win according to difficulty, then that block is considered valid and you won the 50 BTC, or you will have won it for your pool (more likely).

thank you for the insight and sharing about the guy who lost access to 10k BTC! oh my. Tangential question, the 9999BTC that got sent to address C as change, could he have taken that and immediately sent it back to address A for consolidation, and so then be able to safely discard any info about keypairs for address C? (assuming also that he would have had to sit and wait for all tx to complete before abandoning the info of address C)
@_date: 2011-12-28 17:47:56
The way to convet Bitcoins to cash is to sell them for cash. This can be done on various exchanges (pick the one that deals best in your desired cashout currency) where you can offer them for sale for a price, and if someone buys them you'll be able to get the exchange to send you a cheque or wire transfer money to your account or some such. Or you can use your bitcoins to buy prepaid access cards of various types from the vendors that sell them, though this may involve more fees.

no no, douching around on reddit is how i procrastinate and put my mind off the fear of eventual eviction for not earning money. At some point this fear will override my desire to not work on my regular job and i will work and earn some money. kind of hoping that some BTC will appear in my client and then I could step off the feartrain, stop procrastinating and get down to _real work_ (on shit that matters!) ...
do you have any BTC? wanna send me some? fractional? anything? i have a zero balance right now. I earned so far on mtred 0.02 by mining but I'm gonna try to get that to at least 0.04 before taking my payout. Anyway maybe I should just go live in the forest and mooch wifi and forget this rent/money shit.

this is genius. this is such a great idea, and just the start of this idea too. i can see it taken to a whole other level with selective morality, like a list of things you can decline (hardcore vegans for example might not want any btc that ever paid for meat) and there could be various ratings agencies and stuff and oh boy this crypto-anarchy thing is so neato.
@_date: 2011-06-09 21:26:25
I think Ripple is a neato idea but based on a chain of trust is only useful if you have people you trust around you that can link you with the things you need. I think Ripple will eventually take off, but not until more people find a way to use it.
Whats most interesting about bitcoin to me is that people are actually using it. Since seeing the exchanges crop up, I have personally decided I will accept BTC as payment (among other things, my list is at chws.ca) and I take comfort in knowing that if 65BTC magically appeared in 14KE9rQTYEvL8RinYhTYgPq3atoU7493aA (HINT, HINT) that I could pay my rent and expenses this month with it (after converting to national fiat).
An interesting idea that just occurred to me would be a precious metals/BTC exchange running on TOR and using anonymous snail-mail remailer for inbound (and perhaps outbound) metals. This service should be impervious to attack using current technology.

if nobody is working on this, I just want to put it out there that I also think its needed, and that I think I could develop something for this if I could justify spending the time on it. Right now I have to earn money for rent and food every month and I do it by freelancing. If someone wants to give me a flow of BTC (equivealent to $2000CAD per month is all I need to live comfortably) I will work on these kinds of things exclusively. I would love to pay my rent with BTC! (which I understand I'd have to convert BTC to $CAD first but I have to do the exact same thing already with the $USD my client pays me through paypal anyway).
So someone hire me with BTC as a pocket coder. cmon.

then you got /usr/sbin/bitcoind
can run "bitcoind --help" for more info
can run "bitcoind -daemon" to start as daemon
then get more help "bitcoind help"
stores its files usually in ~/.bitcoin/
and that is where the bitcoin.conf file should live, with settings like:
    rpcuser=something
    rpcpassword=p4ssweRd
    paytxfee=0.00
-- 
then you need to talk to it ...
here is some perl code I wrote that leverages existing JSON-RPC libraries to do some talking to it ... 
(shows some examples of calling my bitcoin rpc function ... and then the bitcion rpc function itself ... sorry for any extra crap that is in there, this was being used in a test Bitcion IVR/phone-banking style interface thing I was experimenting with for fun a couple months ago)

Naa its not really like wow gold. The only source of new BTC is from creating new blocks in the block chain. Also its decentralized. And can be sent to other accounts no matter what exchange site they prefer to use. And minimal/nonexistent transfer fees.
Wow gold has 3 distinct sources of injection (quest rewards, direct mob drops, and vendoring of items) into the economy with no upper limit to cap inflation, and relies on the realm server(s) to create it. And cannot be directly sent between realms (with the sole exception of what's in your bag during a character realm transfer, generally with a very high USD transaction fee attached)

Right, this is all well and good, and I'm sorry that your girlfriend is working for a shit scum sucking company for too little money. Been there. I hope that situation improves. But again nobody is really using ripple that I know of, and its been around for a few years now too. Again I like the idea of Ripple and I'll put it out there that if someone wanted to pay me via ripple I'd be willing to accept it _only_ if I knew I could do something with it, whether that be convert it to gold/bitcoin/national-fiat or whatever, or spend it in kind on other real goods and services. Today I can take Bitcoin and turn it into real money or patronize real businesses with it. Therefore I am willing to add Bitcoin to my list of accepted payment methods at this time. To me today Bitcoin is real money just as much as any central bank money. Maybe one day Ripple will get to join the club :) Mutual credit is a more sensible way of issuing the money supply too I believe, because with mutual credit the money supply should exactly match the economic activity it is needed for :) Maybe bitcoin will be the bridge to cross over to a worldwide implementation of Ripple :) There now we are thinking HA. Just think about that :) Ever read the book The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson? Uncanny how things are going in that direction.

bandwidth is not a big thing with it. the amount of data is very little, just lots of attempts at doing hashes of the block + nonce to get a hit. if you already have good hardware how can you justify not mining for mt red right now? like if you're not gaming. ... you could be running guiminer and contributing to mt red and also get yourself something (or donate 100% to mt red if you feel super awesomely inclined to not personally possess any BTC). me, i have a shit pc, 9600GT, 16MGH/sec and when I'm not playing SCII (like when I'm sleeping) this thing is hashing away. ... i have 0.1BTC after a week with mt red! I also donate 1% to mtred, yay me! haha. i'm sure you'd get better results with the real hardware you have ;)
@_date: 2011-06-18 05:48:51

how? miners work in pools and the pool interface is underground on TOR. they get their work tasks and report results via TOR. .. I think they can remain hidden.

well the price seems to be marked at 1BTC, so "enough" is 1BTC, and you need to gain control of it. I've never used cryptoexchange but if it works like the other exchanges then you'll need to load some national currency into it somehow (with cavirtex i can pay a bill online to load canadian shitpaper dollars into it for example) and then i place a buy order at the same price as the lowest currently-for-sale price, so i'll get it right away. then you got a Bitcoin in your trading account and you can send it off on its merry way -- to your own wallet, or even directly to the merchant that wants it for the badge.
@_date: 2011-06-14 06:49:30
yes, if you are mining by yourself, you have a way, WAY less chance of ever seeing any successful payout at all whatsoever. But if you _do_ get lucky, you'll get a 50BTC payout (at the moment.). ... kinda risky to invest in solo mining ... no real reason not to join a pool and share in the wealth, more reliable payouts faster. join mining team reddit!

When you are mining with a pool, any blocks you discover as part of that effort will be awarded to the pool and then the pool operator is responsible for giving out correct portions of the 50BTC to those who contributed hashing power. Because my contributions were so small I was only really eligible for about 0.01 BTC of each of the blocks that were found heh.

Not mandatory, but miners are free to not include tiny annoying feeless transactions in their blocks. The official client softwares will enforce a small fee on tiny-BTC-amount or large-KB-size transactions, but there is I believe no network rule that says you have to include it, and so hacked clients could feed a bunch of crap to the network yes but if this became a problem then miners would probably start only including transactions that had suitable fees.

well no. record of a extension of credit in the block chain. or a record of revoking credit too. then transactions could find a path of credit to the destination. .. this would, i think, have to be something bitcoin-like but separate from the actual bitcoin block chain, since additional info (unit of account) would need to be stored in it and no actual bitcoins/dollars/hours would be involved, just accounting ledger entries between parties that trust each other enough to extend some credit to each other.

Prediction: at some point when we near the 21M coins mark, there will reach a consensus about raising that number and changing some other minor details to keep things going. The key point is consensus of source code and thus enough of the network will agree to the new changes to make them a reality. It will be solved in creative ways that most will agree on. And it will be good!

Interesting point about the mindset of those who do pay for music. Fair enough. Myself when I hear a track I like and get the name of it though its a hop skip and a jump over to isohunt discography or grooveshark+grooveshredder to download a copy for posterity. I do sort of view myself as having a bit of a mission to bear witness to excellent art and spreading it around for the enjoyment of all humanity, but thats just me.
And I suppose with the current tools charging bitcoin for admission might be hard unless all your patrons and yourself all had their computers with bitcoin client running and on a network. 
I wonder, are there any paypal-type services for bitcoin yet? Ones where you can load up a balance and as soon as that balance is verified you can use the service to instantly pay vendors? (vendors would trust this service to deliver the payment, in the same way they currently trust paypal) That way simple mobile phone based apps could be set up to push transactions around and should make charging admission at a live show very doable for anyone that has a web-capable-cellphone (payment provider could even offer a touch-tone IVR interface of some sort for people with non-web-enabled phones). I suppose such a payment processor probably needs to exist before you can accept payment in bitcoin for goods on websites in a simple way as well. Fack I kind of wish someone would pay my rent so I could work on that stuff now.

Yes and no. You dont need to have the full block chain to receive them, but your client wont realize you control them or let you spend them until it is updated. If you just want to check that they were sent to you properly, you can use sites like blockexplorer.com or blockchain.info to see that the transaction was included in a block and they are now titled to a key/address that you control.

how does the network decide what the appropriate new money supply should be? Bitcoin is inherently deflationary because the max supply will never exceed 21M ... hardcoded ... right ? so then to have something different, with a forever increasing supply of bitcoins ... how to regulate it? in real life the money supply should match economic activity if you want to maintain price stability. ... so that might be a starting point for thinking about the issues.

7200 new BTC are minted every day (maximum) in the theoretical 144 blocks that should get calculated each day. Whatever hashing power you bring to the table as a fraction of overall hashing power in the network is what you can expect to get out of that potential daily 7200BTC. In my theory anyway.

Another fun thing to note is that I never donated to a goddam thing before I got into Bitcoin. But sending chunks of Bitcoins around is just so damn easy and feels far more rewarding to me than jumping through hoops to send people central-bank crap.
@_date: 2011-06-09 20:40:38
i thought wallet files just store the pub/priv keys? so 'out of sync' would only mean that some wallet file you created new keypair in that doesnt exist in old file? in theory you should just be able to collect ALL your keypair from all your wallet and merge into a new wallet right? People seem to be confused about where the actual "bitcoins" are stored, and the only real answer I can come back to is the bitcoins exist only in the block chain that makes up the shared ledger, and the only thing that matters that you store personally is your keypairs. lose your keypairs and you lose access to the bitcoins in the network that are bound to those keys. I hope I have that right otherwise I'm building up an erroneous understanding of the system which would suck for my brain.

the problem with your idea is that the block its trying to hash has a payout of 50BTC aimed at the pools account. if he finds a hit, its only going to validate the transaction to the pool account anyway. and if he goes solo it doesnt matter the valid transaction will be part of a block with 50new BTC going to the pool account. He'd have to be hashing a block with a 50BTC payout transaction pointed at his own account and so he would just mine solo from the start.

there are certain theoretical attacks to ECDSA that can only be made when the same address has produced multiple signatures.
So sending multiple times to a single address would be fine, but sending multiple times FROM a single address could expose you to the potential attack (attack that has only been realized when a very bad RNG was used in part of the signing process, afaik)

hrm, well to compare to my results, I've got about BTC 0.11 so far from participating with mtred since the morning of the 8th (about a week now) with my measly 16MH/sec. I'm using the guiminer software. So just going on those numbers but with your MH/s rate, you should reasonably expect to get about BTC 0.015 over a week, I would think.
What GPU are you using? (EDIT: I see you answered that and 2.3MH/s is what others have got with that 8400GS GPU) Mine is a 9600GT card and 16MH/sec is what is expected from that. The better/newer cards are pushing over 300MH/sec :(

my crappy old 9600GT card gets standard/pathetic 16MH/sec and I was mining with MtRed for about a month and a half and I earned about 1.5BTC for my efforts. Would have been twenty times as much if I had a more modern card that does 300MH/sec+

stuff is mostly private company backend things. I build a SQL abstraction system that is as good or better than what django had a couple years ago. I built a captcha relay system before I found out about decaptcher.com .. I build a multi process spambot that posts to statusnet installs and wiki pages in bulk, bypassing captchas etc. I wrote a proxy scraper that does OCR with tesseract on the port numbers of hidemyass.com list. I wrote a gmail account creator and added phone verification relay to the captcha relay thing I made. I wrote a craigslist account creator (but their phone verification uses reducefraud.com so I had to stop because I dont have deep pockets to proceed on that with paid-for-local-area DIDs etc) .. I wrote a bot to create 4chan thread on /b and keep it alive by getting people to go to the captcha relay site and fill the captchas that the bot needed to complete to post, and using public proxies to post. worked good. I ... did stuff. lots of stuff. over the years. always to solve problems or for lulz. 
I will probably have to put some clothes on soon and go out and convince some local company to hire me if I want to stop working for the spamclient. :( oh well. hey leaving the house might be good tho, I might get a chance to ride the pussy train. Oh yeah speaking of pussy I build a human child, or at least seeded one. LOL anyway I expect nothing I will just continue to create my own destiny and continue to be super-lazy about it and otherwise just enjoy the culture and experience of being human here on this ridiculous planet.

While this is nice and all, it can be trivial to arrange with your client to be paid outside of the site, and deal with that risk yourself. Yes it is a violation of the site terms, for both you and your client, so you dont _talk_ about that on the site, you just exchange skype names/whatever and take the conversation there and then negotiate your pay, and bill for a very small number of hours at a time to build up trust. I never let my client owe me too much money before being paid the next invoice, that way you minimize your risk to at most one unpaid invoice.

and i believe that it being illegal would increase its value not decrease it. prohibition makes the banned item exciting and dangerous, and therefore popular with the youth.
if bitcoin was illegal such a ban would be incredibly difficult to enforce for anyone who already has some bitcoin, and nested networks of secret cash-only deals (like drug deals!) will bring newcomers in ways that can't be pinned to identities very easily.
it is not like a stop-and-frisk illegal search would turn up bitcoins on your person if a person takes any steps to hide them, and they will continue to flow freely across borders. countries can try to play whack-a-mole but they'll invest their entire economic output in trying to stop bitcoin! and they'd still fail.

encrypting it doesnt generate new addresses. but new addresses will be created when the 'key pool' is exhausted. the bitcoin-QT client doesnt handle keeping you up-to-date about which address you have backed up or not very well, so a best practice (if not very cumbersome) is to back up a copy of your wallet after every transaction. (because "change" will get sent to an address that may not be in your backups). I kind of hate that but this is one reason why we're still in beta.

there is no official bitcoin price, so it is not an issue. There is only what people are currently buying and selling it for, on various different exchanges. The last price of a transaction on whatever exchange is about as official as it gets, and you're free to choose which exchange you think sucks the least, which right now I hear a lot of people are choosing Bitstamp. If you are using software to do USD exchange calculations for realtime pricing updates, you get to choose your price source, or rely on your merchant-services API to make the choice for you.

asdjfsjhfkdjs says ...
That's normal. Those are unfilled orders – somebody has announced that they're willing to part with their bitcoins for 6100 CAD each, but nobody has taken them up on that offer. If you make a market order, it always gets filled with the cheapest coins available, so that offer isn't going to make a difference until all the cheaper ones are gone. (And then only if someone thinks the coins are worth it...)
If you look at the bottom of the mtgoxUSD orderbook, you'll see that there are a handful of coins available at prices like $1 million USD, $1 billion USD, and about $13 trillion USD. It's really more of a joke than anything else, but I'm sure they'd be willing to follow through on the offer if you took them up on it.

It hit a low of about $2.50 around November 18 2011. It took until the beginning of March 2013 to hit its old high of ~$32 again. 
That is more like 15 months from post-bubble price low to exceed all-time-high.
Do you think we've seen the post-bubble low from this spike to $266? In 2011 it took 5 months to hit the bottom after the bubble burst, and if history repeats then we haven't seen the bottom yet.

your wallet (bitcoin qt v0.7.x presumably) is downloading the entire block chian. its kind of heavy, you could try 0.8 release candidate for a better experience or use a lightweight client like multibit instead. your nvidia card is weak for bitcoin mining so expect progress to be painfully slow if not counterproductive if you are paying the electricity bill. satoshi was a psuedonym for either the person or team that created bitcoin ... while some folks have suspicions about who the real person(s) behind the original source code release might be, it is not known for sure (and when you put out an idea that has the power to kill the power base of nation states and central banks, you probably dont want to attach your real identity anyway).

they are totally and utterly completely different things. 
Bitcoin-qt is the "mainline" client aka the "satoshi" client, where you run a node on the bitcoin network yourself and host a full copy of the blockchain ledger. you also have your own wallet.dat file on your PC with this, and should definitely encrypt it with a passphrase right after installing the software (option in program dropdown menu).
Blockchain.info a website offering cool statistics and information about the bitcoin blockchain, and also a pretty damn good and secure web-wallet service called "my wallet".
Bitcoin-qt can not directly acccess your blockchain.info wallet. I believe you may be able to export private keys and load them into the site somehow but never tried doing that, so there may be indirect ways of doing it.
@_date: 2013-08-05 23:41:23
it is a ledger where people can move units as small as 0.00000001 btc between accounts in the ledger by signing them over. miners record those transactions into new pages of the ledger so that everyone can agree what is really in the ledger, and as a reward for doing so, they get to keep transaction fees and a bonus block reward (fresh new BTC).
@_date: 2013-01-03 16:44:51

First example: Person A can't know who Person C or D is or what they are selling unless Person C or D want that information known.
Second Example: Of course, the 1667 BTC could belong to the casino, or it could belong to anyone else. You can't really know. Now, if the casino continually uses the same address publicly and you follow a blockchain trail to an address like that, its probably the casino. But if its just some random address, you can't really know who controls it.
Third Example: You could easily say that you lost your keys to that address in a boating accident. Or yeah you could just pass them on to a new key that you have only on paper or in an encrypted file, etc, so you can deny that you still have it at all and claim that you spent in on hookers, etc.
Bonus question: I'm pretty sure the QT client will choose random addresses to pull from, possibly selecting for lower mining fees (iirc coins that have been sitting around longer have less mining fee requirement), but other implementations will vary.

Sorry but your post is genuinely funny. Are you at least using version 0.8 or newer of the bitcoin client? It really should sync up faster (hours, not days) if you have that version or newer.

No, buying them is the easiest way to get large amounts of coins. Bitcoins are stable in that they are based on a protocol that does not respond to or care about government rules. Yes you can have as many different accounts/addresses as you want. Paypal is reversible so nobody will sell you irreversible bitcoins for your paypal, but you can find someone on localbitcoins or other sites who will sell you a bitcoin or a part of a bitcoin for cash. Bitcoin is only equal opportunity in that anyone with the equipment can mine for them, and some portion of the bitcoins that people hold simply won't be for sale for the 1% to buy, and why would 1%ers want to buy into a currency they can't control anyway? (Goes against their M.O.)

Unfortunately the ability to choose which addresses you send from (a feature that would be called 'coin control') is not a built-in feature of the QT client. It just sort of picks addresses that have enough funds to make the transfer and sends from what it feels like, and sends 'change' back to new addresses you have that you didn't even know you had. Less than ideal in my opinion. I hear that you can use the Armory client (which is a separate thing that goes on top of bitcoin-qt) if you want a higher level of control.

right. so you can move it to another address. or send it in pieces to multiple other addresses. and nobody can know who controls those other addresses that it gets sent on to. in fact when someone sends you 500 BTC, they dont even know that it is going to an address you control. it could be going to a payment processor that you have hired. there is plausible deniability at every step.

if you try do these transactions one at a time, unless you have inputs that exactly match the output, you'll need to wait for the change to confirm. A better way to do this kind of thing would be to create a single transaction with multiple outputs (an output for each of the 10 addresses you want to send some coins to, and a 'change' output to sent all unspent input back to some other address you control)

@_date: 2013-03-29 03:30:32
To answer your questions succinctly ... it gets its value from the market, scarce supply and increasing demand. You get it by trading something you have like dollars for the bitcoins that other people have, or get brand newly minted ones by solving new blocks (ledger pages) in the block chain. It cannot be just inflated because new ledger blocks have to follow strict rules and producing them is computationally difficult. If you have any background in computer science and/or understand what public key crypto is and what a hash function is, you should read satoshi's original whitepaper.

Its not "excessive" until it is so far beyond a coalition of governments financial ability to purchase ASIC equipment and out-mine the existing miners. If we get to that point where we are so far ahead of any possible computation attack on the part of governments, then we can call it excessive. And we best keep it that way :)

The end result will be an overheated phone with a battery that no longer holds a charge, and approximately zero bitcoins. You need ASIC hardware to mine any appreciable amount of bitcoins and not spend more money on keeping the equipment running than you earn with it.

people can try and ddos, but generally will have to pay a transaction fee to get their transactions included in blocks, especially small spammy-looking transactions. as for bitcoin 'theft', many (including me) argue that there is no such thing and that all incidents of claimed 'theft' are just inside-jobs trying to pass themselves off as being hacked, so as to run off with the coins they were trusted with.

Then tell him you read the bitcoin source code and that according to the source code its not a single person issuing them, its a decentralized p2p network. Also let him know that protocol rules implemented by that source code cannot be changed without the consent of a majority of the network, that nobody is promising any returns on bitcoin, and that the lead deveopers of the code have repeatedly stated that bitcoin should not be seen as an investment but instead an experiment.

in Canada you can use the cavirtex exchange and deposit cash at RBC or scotiabank to fund your cavirtex account (3$ fee to process cash deposit) and then buy some on the exchange (3% fee for low volumes). So its pretty quick and easy and gets you close to the market price. 
Cavirtex used to have much lower fees (no fee to process cash, 0.5% trading fees on any volume) and thus are ripe to get competed with by upcoming toronto bitcoin exchange and ferroh's exchange but since those dont exist quite yet, cavirtex still works really well.

Talk about a ledger, made up of pages. New pages have to follow strict rules that everyone who reads the ledger agrees on. As a reward for creating a new ledger page that fits the rules, accountants get a reward of new bitcoins. And creating a new page is difficult, and because of this difficulty and the rules about how many new bitcoins are created with each new page, there will only ever be 21 million of them.
Talk about how entries in the ledger are re-titled to other owners using signatures. And the accountants who are struggling to create the new ledger pages verify the signatures and include the transactions in the new pages.
Talk about how each page is linked to the past one, so pages cannot be inserted anywhere, it forms a complete historical record of all bitcoin transactions ever.

i'm pretty sure that is correct, initially it is supposed to generate 100 addresses, and i think those will get used up also when it sends change to itself (to addresses that it made for you that it doesnt tell you that it made for you!!) so pretty well every 100 transactions or so you should back up.

If I am wrong, please somebody more familiar with the scam post here and inform us, because it has always been claimed as a fact repeatedly within the bitcoin community that paypal has been charge-backed after people have sold bitcoins for it and that is why nobody sells bitcoins for paypal.

On the mining pool, after you've done enough work to have earned some fractional coins, you'll be able to use the pools web interface to transfer funds out of your pool account to wherever you want like your local bitcoin wallet.

1) hash of the block of transactions + nonce. if it is low enough number produced by hash function, you win. (see current difficulty/target)
2) coin is ledger entry. single "coin" is 100 million base units aka satoshis. 25 fresh new coins awarded in coinbase transaction to winning miner.
3) every time a new block comes out it includes the new transactions, and the longest block chain wins. so as more time goes by and more blocks are released it becomes ever more difficult to try and rewrite history.

you need to figure out which of the many ways of buying bitcoins will work best for you. Some questions that can help you to find that method are 1) What country are you in where you want to buy Bitcoin? 2) How much Bitcoin do you want to buy and 3) What is the precise form of "money" that you want to pay with? (cash in hand, wire transfer?)
@_date: 2013-01-17 01:53:34
maybe. but how does a dead person send bitcoins to you anyway? presumably the keys to the coins were encrypted with a passphrase only the person who died knew. otherwise anyone with access to the keys could have swept the funds before they died, no? at any rate, it would be best to set it up such that no information about bitcoin inheritance falls into the hands of the state, then you can ignore tax sillyness.

Regulation is laws created by a authoritative body of a "country" that affect some activities that people do, with penalties for disobeying the "rules".
Bitcoin is a protocol and as such it cannot be regulated any more than Bittorrent or HTTP can be regulated. On the other hand, Bitcoin exchanges can be regulated. If you do not wish to be affected by regulations then you will be required to do business only with companies or individuals who also don't give a crap about regulations. Like on localbitcoins or toratm.

if the exchange rate continues to go up, the default fee in the reference client will be reduced exactly like it was last time when the default fee was 0.01 btc ... and if you dont like it you're free to send a transaction that has no fee attached (and wait while no miner bothers to include it because of not having a sufficient fee).

yes the fee goes to miners, for the service they provide of including your transaction in their block. (they dont need to include your transaction, so may as well give them an incentive). Yes, today there is a block reward, but once at some point there will not be any block reward and the fees will be the miners only reward. Yes the fee should be more dynamic and smaller to allow reasonable micropayments. The default fee has changed several times already to get smaller as the market value of the bitcoins has gone up. I think about now is due for another change to decrease the "standard" fee from 10k satoshis down to maybe 1k satoshis or something.

My guess is that the exchange rate plus the 3% fee that cavirtex charges on low volume traders has a lot to do with the pricing difference.

Who knows, but having some Bitcoin and Silver on hand for when it does enter its period of hyperinflationary collapse would be wise. Right now, there are many things you can do with bitcoin that you cannot do with central bank money, and so those benefits might be best to focus on at the present time. Such as funding things your government might not like, or sending large amounts of value to recipients in other countries with next to no fees and a complete avoidance of capital controls.

you dont need millions of users to agree. all you need is the 51% of the miners (mining pool operators) to agree on protocol rule changes. everyone else can take their time to upgrade clients and until upgrades happen maybe outdated clients reject blocks but its a pretty simple matter of realizing you are out of date and to upgrade if you want to handle new protocol rules and accept transactions that use them.
@_date: 2013-06-26 00:35:43
no consensus needed. every solo-miner is free to include whatever transactions he feels like. keep in mind, most people are mining on a pool and its the pool operator that sets the transactions being mined for those blocks.

its called 'Cold Storage Spending' in mycelium, and its a way for it to just use the printed private key to sign a transaction (and send change back to the same key), without having to actually import the key into the wallet app. So if my phone gets stolen later there is no trace of my offline-paper-wallet key in memory. I don't know of other apps that offer this, but I'm sure if any don't they all will implement it soon, because its pretty cool.

This is not the reason they should offer discounts. They should offer discounts because when they accept bitcoin they are a) not subject to high creditcard/paypal merchant fees and b) not exposing themselves to chargeback risks. Something in the neighborhood of 3-5% right now of all normal merchant prices is to accommodate those existing fees and risks, and so _that_ would be a reasonable default pay-in-bitcoin price discount.

Bitcoin miners control the means of production, that is the hashing machines, and sell the product of their factory output (bitcoins) to the highest bidder. They are also competing with one another for a fixed amount of btc per day, and they will do what it takes (including taking risks) to get access to faster equipment to get a bigger piece of that pie. If they had to have human workers to produce those bitcoins, they would pay them the lowest possible amount in order to gain the most profits. 
This capitalist controlled "means of production" you speak of is capital factory equipment and other heavy machinery that is purchased often with loans with the loan-taker taking on a significant risk, and if he fails in his business venture, he pays the price. Anyone can do it, you just need to be smart and make the right kind of sales pitch (to a bank, or crowd-funding sources, family members, etc) to get access to the resources (typically money) required to procure the equipment you need to start up your business.
The future at any rate, is all this "work" that socialists want to do is going to be done by robots.

Why would selling 0.1 BTC be difficult? What kind of currency do you want? Find an exchange that deals in the currency, create an account, transfer in some BTC, post a sell order for the amount you want to sell (at the price of the highest offer if you want to sell it ASAP), then withdraw the fiat currency to your bank account or whatever. Might lose some to withdrawl fees on such a low amount, might make more sense to find a local buyer (or advertise yourself as a local seller) via localbitcoins

You can use an external program to sign and broadcast a replacement transaction that has a fee and that one should get picked up. Electrum won't let you do it I dont think but you should be able to export the keys to a program that can .. I think someone wrote a python script that can do that. But I forget the name of it. Gah I'm not super helpful I guess. ... Like the other guy said you basically need to double-spend it with a fee attached so it gets picked up (but electrum doubtlessly wont provide that functionality) or just wait.

If these people send out information that is not valid according to the bitcoin protocol rules then it will simply be ignored. If a bunch of miners decide to adopt new rules, and mine blocks that violate the bitcoin protocol rules, then those blocks will be rejected by everyone that operates under the standard rules.

I strongly believe that there should be a simple option to turn this off for any given transaction being put out by the QT client. A simple checkbox on the send-payment screen that says "Send change to originating address". But NOOOO ... :( Of course you can still manually send all funds back to the address you want them in every single time after making a transaction but that gets real annoying real quick. (Not to mention potentially error prone and expensive with additional fees)
@_date: 2013-10-10 15:37:21
it would seem likely that cavirtex will implement this option sometime later. once they have the first step in place, adding an automated way (say a special deposit BTC address or something) for you to auto-sell BTC and have it loaded into your debit card will be rather easy.

the hashrate is inferred from how fast blocks are solved based on the current difficulty. there is no direct way to measure it. And there is no way to know exactly what devices are doing how much of the hashing.

All that is required is that the laundry service send you back coins that are not connected to any transaction flow that your dirty address participated in. So at a minimum, the laundry would have to have the amount of BTC that you want to launder already on hand from some other source. And yes, ideally there would be other activity happening other than your laundry request. Such services would hopefully have many different wash cycles happening for many different clients all at the same time. And random dissociation and chunking-over-time of transactions should obfuscate things nicely. 
And sure, don't merge it into a single address holding exactly the amount that you wanted to launder. Split it into 2 addresses of 2 random amounts.

The network effect.
Your favorite network protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc) are good examples. Same with telephone system. Same with Facebook and Twitter. Any one of these things can be cloned and nobody will care or use it unless it offers some major new benefit, in which case everyone will just switch over to the new one (use Myspace much lately? Gopher protocol much at all?)
The dominant network is the one that rules until something truly superior supplants it.

Drug prohibition pushed up the price of drugs therefore bitcoin prohibition will push up the price of bitcoins. By virtue of being forced underground the whole business will become riskier. More coins will get destroyed via police raids etc. They will become more artificially scarce than they are now and that will push the price up. ... Yesterdays glitch was a testament to the resilience of the current dev team and pool operators. Under prohibition such glitches might be more difficult to sort out as certainly coordinated communication on the matter would be taking place outside of public freenode IRC channels. At any rate, the exchange rate is down 10% from previous highs ... not the biggest hit it could have taken considering the potential magnitude of such glitches.

People that work a "job" for a regular business that reports their "income" to the state tax authority will of course have to keep doing this. But freelancers that work under assumed names with no SSN/SIN attached to their work can avoid taxation by demanding their client/employer pay them in cash or bitcoins etc.
Grey and black markets (aka System D) play an increasingly important role in the economy, and these businesses tend not to mind keeping their books to themselves.

Miners that want to earn a profit need to use efficient hardware, simple as that. Neither nVidia cards nor AMD cards were purpose-built for Bitcoin mining but for a long time AMD cards happened to work well for it. These days its all ASIC though and you need to get the latest equipment at the earliest stage of its release in order to make a profit before difficulty increases make your equipment obsolete. Mining is becoming extremely competitive. 
If you want to get some bitcoins to hold, best to just buy them.

- i've got dividends paid to me every wednesday for as long as i've had these shares (3 weeks now). so far the average return seems to be about 1.7% per week going by the past 3 weeks. (note: havelock keeps 5% of the dividend payout for fund management fee)
- the dividends have been different each week (the first week was right after a large hardware sale apparently), and the price has fluctuated from my original price up to over 0.026 and back to where it is now.
- this is only available for purchase via btc (and with havelock it only takes one confirmation before funds are available to spend on shares! I was surprised by how fast it all was)

It goes into the pocket of the exchange as payment for the service they provide. From there they might do things like use it to pay for server costs, pay employees, buy small private islands in the pacific ocean or even sell it into their own marketplace. I can only imagine it has a negligible effect on the market since it is such a small fee. Except on cavirtex with their 3% fee on low volumes where the effect on the market is to cause small fish aka casual buyers/traders to really want to see Libertybit become successful and take their marketshare in Canada away.

The nutshell explanation is they have a list of daily pre-generated secrets, the hashes of which have been published and blockchain-timestamped, and your dice roll is the first bytes of a hash of your transactionid+todays secret. the current days secret is published the next day so you can verify. But really you should read the "verification" page linked at the top of satoshidice.com for a detailed explanation of their implementation.

you create your own new address (keypair) for yourself and you use the private key that btcquick gave you to sweep the funds to your new address. if you ever transferred the funds _back_ to the address btcquick provided the funds with then yes of they could take them, so you wouldn't want to do that.

I'm not sure how you can prevent someone from lying about the exchange rate in order to store whatever they wanted in the blockchain for exchange rate difference. If there is a central exchange being used to determine the prices, that exchange could be manipulated (someone could hold Mr Karpeles at gunpoint and command certain database entries be made and published, etc). Also, what good is pegging against fiat exchange rate in today when trying to value against a future fiat exchange rate? Fiat currencies notoriously hyperinflate and become worthless, so what then of the pegs when the currencies/exchanges they are pegged to in the past are now meaningless? Better peg to a basket of commodities instead maybe ... or just _let_ market forces do their thing and let the speculators deal with themselves. I think you just need to give this bitcoin free market experiment more time (like 20 more years). MtGox could shut down or go crooked tomorrow, fiat currencies could hyperinflate tomorrow, etc. Seems all the external factors would make it totally unworkable. Bitcoin is so nicely self contained right now. All the centralized exchanges could get droned tomorrow and yet bitcoin could carry on just fine. 
(In fact, if you want to get the speculators out, drone strikes on the data centers that the exchanges use might be the right solution)

depends how they are sending the data to your server. it might be the whole body of their post, or some post variable, i haven't reviewed their api docs. they should have a way to help you test your integration so you know it works, that way you can mess around with it.

forgive me please. It was total sarcasm, bitcoin wont help at all with those things. the point is that their idea of a 'resource based economy' with no price mechanism and no free market is nonsensical.

or maybe, if our system of government and finance wasnt this giant thumb being pressed down on everyone we could work to survive for 8 hours a week and spend the rest of the time sailing or making art. seriously who is this "we" that is going to provide this money to ... us all .. after governments are de-funded and cannot effectively rob the citizenry through forced taxation any longer? and how will it be decided what house each person gets? because I obviously deserve a nice 5000 squre foot home on the beach with a great view in a temperate climate. And I'm sure everyone else does too! I don't see it as realistic and workable. On the other hand, I see crypto-anarcho-capitalism as an inevitability and am under the belief that when governments are about as meaningful as the catholic church has become (from what it used to be!) that humanity will be able to get a lot more done with a lot less effort, and hence less work for everyone to survive and more free time for sailing.

A decentralized ledger currency system with a mathematically predictable supply inflation that doesn't lend itself to being controlled by central planners is pretty counter productive to everything these statist control freaks stand for.

A credit card is tied to a national currency and can be charged back. Bitcoin is its own currency and is irreversible. Nothing 'backs' bitcoin the same way that nothing 'backs' gold or the USD.

"cheaper" doesnt mean much unless their ratio to btc is improving. might as well just buy btc. anyway the point of those other coins is to pump them and then trade them for btc when they are overvalued. because btc is all anyone really wants.

when they crack a million per, then they'll crash back down to 200k per, then they'll slide back up to 600k per where they will stabilize such that a single bitcoin will always buy a "nice house" in a "desireable area" kind of like an ounce of gold has always bought a "nice suit".

i think that would help. i dont know if there is a limit to the number of inputs or outputs in a single tx. the 1MB block size is a problem. but I think it would be fine to bump that to 100MB. and there are other possibilities for blockchain pruning and dht/partial ledger mirroring etc.

I've got a script that produces a page of 6 unique private key QR codes and prepares a transaction to fund them with, so all I have to do is print them out and push the funding TX onto the network and then I've got these nice little give-aways. I should be set to actually give some away soon, and will report about how it goes on here after some time.

Alice's client created the private key at the same time as the public key, and kept track of it. When alice told someone to pay her, she provided a public key for which she knew she had the matching private key.
The output that Alice created for Bob is a message signed by Alice's private key that includes Bob's public key and says that whoever controls the matching private key can spend that output (which should hopefully be Bob).

imo since you did so well already sell $500 worth and hold onto the rest. if it crash then you lost nothing, if it gains more then you still have 7/8 of your holdings in the game.

Because MtGox is obsessed with KFC and MLB. I mean KYC and AML. (But chicken and baseball are more fun than regulatory bullshit).
The account bitcoin tip sets up if i remember right is on blockchain.info which makes it safer than mtgox, since mtgox has a history of having been hacked and losing customer funds (once upon a time anyway) where blockchain.info has a so far untarnished history of pure awesome. plus that in-browser encryption and the fact that blockchain.info can't even access your funds if they wanted to ... unlike mtgox
