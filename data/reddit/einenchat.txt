yeah I guess my question stems from not knowing much about how something like that can be effected. Coz as u/ebliever has correctly identified, collateral posting cant be directly into the other party's account.. it needs to be held separately such the 'claim' of the lender can only be activated in the event of a default event.. hence the question
Edit: so I guess can also be posted with title transfer altogether.. this could get interesting!

you reckon CBOE or such indices would be open to provide custodian services?

I see - and am guessing there will be established escrow account providers.. cool..thanks!
Edit: ok found a few of these.. I suppose - at institutional level - might need to even vet the escrow providers to onboard them as a counterparty.. hmmmm
Edit2: Think the legal framework needs to be set.. currently the regulatory docs supporting collateral as ISDA and GMRA (or NAFMI) will need to modify them to accept BTC as legal collateral.. am going deeper into the rabbit hole

yeah - thanks u/ItsNotTheButterZone also put the link above.. although from what I read, it seems like 'marketplace' which brings together lenders to ppl who want to use BTC collateral .. so every user could potentially have their own estimate of haircuts.. but that's still useful nevertheless.. cheers
