They will lose everything 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:22:53
Probably too much and expecting to double it on November 16
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:02:30
Those people short overvalued stuff. They will kill BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:54:11
I can't imagine a future with a world dominant Cryptocurrency Called B2X. It's an ugly name. I heard coinbase would call it BTC 
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:02:20
Very useful article indeed 
@_date: 2017-11-09 12:56:28
Holders should not be so happy. The price rose from 3k to 7k only because the average Joe wanted free money from the fork. Now this speculation is off, and as you see, since the call off the price is going down. It will take a few weeks to go back to 3/4 k 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:18:09
Don't be a Clown. None of you uses or plans to use BTC as a currency, you just hold it as long as the price doesn't crush 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:44:48
It can however also lose a lot especially after a huge run. People should accept this fact without fear but I think many will freak out (omg I got in late and I am the looser in the room). There space to go down to 3000
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:23:59
It can have value. It went from 0 to 7000. It's going back to 400 / 500 that's already a huge gain and a fair value but now you are in a fullfledged bubble 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:27:41
Suckers in 1999 were robbed by the dot com bubble, these new suckers will be cleaned by the bitcoin bubble burst 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:39:06
Look, every bubble pops. I just wish I can be short when it happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:00:19
What is that he said that is false exactly?
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:52:50
Of. Stupìd. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:17:53
That useless CEO paid by taxpayers money can only shame and shut the duck up, we all remember what he did.... 
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:53:58
You can die parasite 
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:54:31
Of course. They can all die
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:06:20
Remember, China is going to ban bitcoin every weekend 
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:34:18
Coinbase support is non existing, Coinbase is a shit 
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:15:06
Ah ah ah the bankster is in trouble I gues
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:33:52
Finally they will be able to short bitcoin and beat it down to death
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:06:35
He will die soon, I almost sure. God will punish him for all his evils
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:20:24
It's the end, bitcoin will fail 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:10:50
in fact is going down
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:12:12
on the contrary...
@_date: 2017-09-12 19:03:42
Nobody is panicking, that was the China bannning exchanges dip. JPMorgan is already dead, living thanks to taxpayers subsidies, and should not have any saying on this matters, it's just laughable an opinion by such a scam bankster 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:14:10
segwit2x is not going to happen
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:14:29
No, seriously. Late comers lose everything 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:01:21
He is becoming object of jokes, no more a scaring voice. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:58:37
Ah ah ah 
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:38:38
Never trust a Gipsy 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:11:42
yes , when people don't have arguments, they INSULT :)
you , don't have arguments and bitcoin is going down
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:42:30
The rise in BTC from 3000 to 6000 is due to external investors and alt investors buying it to be able to get "free money" through the forks . If this opportunity ceases the buying spree will come to an end.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:15:22
it's better to sell all BTC on Coinbase ?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:54:10
Very good, Dimon said it will crash. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:40:48
You describe a intergenerational ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:12:09
Of course it was only stupid people would not know it
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:26:29
Everybody is buying bitcoin, the bubble will not make all these people rich, like always inky a few get the money at the end 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:56:54
See? It's tanking, what I was saying earlier today.... 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:16:51
Yes, it's all a giant scam
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:00:19
Imagine if Warren buffer or jemi Dimon are right and you bough after a +5000% run up and end up Losing everything. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:11:56
Yes, it might not happen, let's see 
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:51:40
Take out of that market cap all the government subsidiary and taxpayers money... Let's see what's left
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:13:25
no, it's probably not coming, but why are you guys freaking out? wasn' that bad to have a fork ? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:35:20
I am hearing from many sources that Segwit2X fork might not happen. That would be bearish for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:26:34
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:21:29
I always believe people from the future, how dumb can be someone who doesn't!? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:10:39
Oh wow what an intelligent post
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:11:10
It is
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:19:28
