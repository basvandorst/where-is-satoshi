I thought this was a bamboozle when I saw this earlier. Can't believe you actually went through with it you glorious bitcoiner.

Not that I know of, and any method that would get you close to that would be a repetitive grind. That's fine if you don't mind the grind, but I prefer to just play the game and ignore the income.


The game rewards this type of behavior. When you begin an import/export it alerts everyone else in the server and shows them your location. They get money or xp for killing you and taking your vehicle. Avoiding other players is part of the challenge. If the server is too full, you could try switching to a new one.  If you don't want to play with other players, why not stick with single player? The campaign is great.

I'd love to try out a livestream lobby. I'm a pleb on xBox, so I don't have much choice in servers. 99% of the time, other players shoot first and ask questions later. It's very rare for me to be near another player without them shooting at me.

I've played mostly solo for three years. Not much, just a few hours per week. My character is level 85. Found that I make about $50k/hour on average between the different activities in game. Most of your big purchases like supercars or businesses cost around 1-2 million. I buy something big every few few weeks.
I generally stay away from other players, and haven't spent much time doing missions or races online.  I like the freeworld activities like importing/exporting cars or motorcycle club missions. It's been a fun casual game for me to pick up when I'm bored.
