To elaborate: if you lose a private key, you lose the only way to transfer bitcoins out of that address.
Losing btc can also mean that a hacker got a hold of above key, transferred it to an address with a key they own/know.

The recipient doesn't verify the transaction but the miners do!
**Or rather, does the hash function require use of the private key therefore its mathematically impossible to perform the transaction without the private key?**
Yes exactly, the private key is used to sign the transaction in way that miners can verify ownership based on the signature and the address.
One can even sign a message with the key to prove they own an address without even sending a TX (

Dus you try this?
Can't imagine this wouldn't work, because basically your phone is doing thé same with it's camera. The logic is in thé program reading the stream...

What has driven you to go AWOL and let other devs take over your project?
I as a programmer always feel like a father for the code I produce, so I can imagine what it feels what Bitcoin is to you. 
So what made you decide to let others be the stepfather of your baby?
Edit: 
If you want to prove you are thé satoshi, you could always transfer 0.0000001 Bitcoin from within the genesis block to a random address and show us the tx....

Oh my, I'm exactly like you!
A colleague mentioned the high exchange rate of bitcoins.
I recalled fiddling with it a couple of years ago and searched my PC for it: et voila-&gt; I found my old wallet.dat.
Imported it and thought I had like 10 coins it, but appearently I mined 100 (2x50BTC in two weeks in the days of july 2010)!! So booya, no debt anymore and stashed the rest on my savings account.
I am now a happy man and needed this unexpected piece of happiness.

Been there, done that.
I got burned by a ridiculous low stop-loss.
What I learned is to not panicsell and it cost me around 4 btc. 
With this crash I was amazingly calm and even bought some, so I can say it worked!
I know it's a tough pill to swallow right now, though, but don't dwindle too long on how much you could have made (hell, I could have earned much more if I didn't cash out some in thé $260 top in April, but otoh I paid off debts l had).

And we will dub this crash:
"The Google Translations gone wrong"-crash.
