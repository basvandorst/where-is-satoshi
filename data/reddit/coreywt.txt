He doesn't say he's including the value of the forked coins he should also have (BCH, BTG etc) but that's still high even if you include those

No if you had $1 which increases 57.353% then you have $1.57. Think about a year ago, the price was around $4,000-$5,000 and is now $6500.

I gave up on my Blue and Ledger and took their offer to return my Blue. Got my reply from support to send it back today. Think I'll buy a Trezor T with the refund.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:12:29
I think they gave everyone time and a fair chance to withdraw their coins before they shut down, but I don't remember. I got out of the market for a few years before they shut down.
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:39:45
I'm embarrassed I bought a Blue like a sucker, believing the statements that it would get a firmware update with passphrase protection soon. And now the Nano S gets an update to hold so many more coins, and protection from the newly announced vulnerability that presumably the Blue is also susceptible to as well?  I have a Trezor as well and I'll be sticking with Trezor.

Ledger claims they’re still supporting the Blue,  and announced that they will be announcing an update to the Blue at some time in the future (with passphrase support and protection against the new vulnerability). Of course they first said the Blue would be getting the update in December. They also said now all Blue owners can return for a refund. I’m taking them up on it.

Gemini is good if you're eligible where you live, if you can get over their repeated "scheduled maintenance" always during US primetime.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:11:01
Nope, the Ledger Blue doesn’t have the passphrase feature (Nano S does). Just one reason a lot of Blue owners (like myself) are pissed off and done with Ledger.

I argued a point with support once, it ended up they decided in my favor after initally saying no, and they replied to me FIVE MINUTES after I responded to their initial fairly quick response. Given the weeks-long delays I'm used to from other Bitcoin companies' support teams, I was pleasantly shocked.
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:24:33
And they're selling a 2-pack. I was just thinking about getting Cryptosteel but I like the looks of this better. My concerns: how do you punch both sides, is there gap in the middle? Is it really that easy to punch AND durable enough to survive most anything?

All right, I stand corrected. I was thinking of the Trezor T and another wallet I had where this is true, but on the original Trezor apparently you have to enter the seed on the site if you want to restore. But about that selling point that “your private keys never leave the device”—keep in mind that’s effectively not true if you restore/recover your seed that way 
@_date: 2018-07-01 22:21:29
if you entered your seed words on a website—you’ve been hacked. You should never enter them anywhere other than the Trezor itself (or another wallet)
