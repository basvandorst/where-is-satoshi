I think that is a possibility, but I would also imagine that the bitcoin wallet user base is a fairly narrow one, and there could be an advertiser interested in just having that presence.
Another concept would be to approach one of the larger companies about sponsoring wallet development, and, in return, some functionality could be tied in to their service. Imagine a secure wallet, with an open source code, that had a buy/sell functionality tied to coinbase.
The current wallet development environment stresses function over form because the current bitcoin users don't need bells and whistles, and haven't needed someone to hold their hand. Unfortunately, I don't think unpaid developers will have the time and resources to make bitcoin a user friendly experience without finding some way to commercialize the process, as we are seeing with multibit.

It does seem feasible, though, to have an ad-supported wallet. I'd be willing to imagine that a single ad slot on a widely used wallet would generate enough revenue to provide incentive for continued development.  Plus, if you make a conscious effort to screen advertisers, the click-through rate could be fairly high.

But, in all seriousness, I agree that we should leave Dorian alone. The identity of the real bitcoin founder is irrelevant, a this guy got caught in the crossfire of one of the few internet phenomenons that actually has staying power.

Core bitcoin users now are not the core bitcoin users of the future. Plus, objectors are under no obligation to take part in the trust-based system, at the cost of being able to use the convenience of the service. The overall bitcoin ledger is still public, the service just locks up the btc that they will be working with off-chain. The key piece will be the service provider being able to prove that their network holds the value that equals or exceeds the sum of the user accounts. Easily verified.

I would probably stash the private key in a few places and get the public key QR tattooed on me as a pattern of large and small dots.

That was exactly my feeling. It was a huge risk going with them, that risk paid off, and I'm happy to be out. I've seen a pretty gradual reduction in their payout %, which seems in no way tied to either BTC price or trade volume, which seems a pretty good indication of where they are headed.

I wouldn't say that the analogy isn't completely inaccurate, as keeping cash on your hand and keeping your bitcoin in a web wallet are both approximately the most exposed state possible, and are the default state that you receive the currency after acquiring them from a financial institution, in the sense that you literally do nothing to secure it once received.

This is like blasting someone for not feeling comfortable carrying around 10 grand in their back pocket. Sure, there are people that have no issue doing that, but there is risk associated, and everyone chooses to mitigate their risk differently. Props to you for believing in coinbase, but excuse me while I go generate a wallet on my non-internet connected TI-89 calculator in an underground bunker near the core of the earth.

I did the same thing. I invested something like 2 BTC back in Feb. The whole thing ran it's course, despite my being weary of their process. I earned about 65-70% on my investment and was returned all of the initial investment. I decided not to reinvest, though, on the off-chance that it was a very involved ponzi. I'm more than happy to take my earnings and run.

Say what you will about his evangelism and personal opinions, I think it is safe to say that he is an expert in his field, which probably rules out his being an idiot.

while the statistics should even out in the long run, increasing difficulty/network hashrate means that it won't. If your hashrate stays constant and the network hash rises, your investment becomes less valuable over time, hence higher frequency payouts are worth more.

Look, I just unsubbed from r/bitcoin. Both sides are full of bullshit egos,  and it's become an echo chamber of negativity. It's gotten to the point where productive conversation can't even occur,  and the mods encourage and participate in the negative attitude that perpetuates it. As a casual bitcoin user,  I don't have a stake in any side of any argument,  but I've grown completely exhausted of the polarized way that these conversations end up,  and the false pretense that, in this case,  Theymos has set up in claiming that he isn't trying to be spiteful,  just speaking the "truth". I don't owe him anything for running this sub, and, in my perspective, he is doing a great job of running it into the ground. I'm more than happy to have my front page clear of these toxic battles that accomplish nothing other than drive people from the conversation.

There's definitely nothing random about you being a jerk, it's very specific and intentional. It's attitudes like yours that tarnish this community.

Well,  that's certainly true, and unfortunate,  as it is so readily accessible to the public.
