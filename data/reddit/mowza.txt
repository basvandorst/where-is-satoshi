Crypto is short for crypto currency. Currencies are what you use to buy things. The normalization of crypto IMO is to use it. Other people could also say that you can buy things anonymously and to do so you’d need to use Crypto, like on Silk Road.

I bought 30 at $10 and used them like a currency.  Oops.
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:20:23
The best way to look at it is you were using a crypto currency as a crypto currency not some sort of bond. Also neither of us would have possibly held all of it as it went up.

Just thinking about those that bought near 20 and we’re mortgaging houses and what not. Ouch!

All mine was spent on rare psychedelics and pharma grade MDMA for Coachella 2013.

That's what I thought...silly me.

I had 30 BTC I paid $10 and under for and spent them all and some new age speculators made fun of me for using them. Well obviously I would have loved the 600k but are they a currency or not!?

The quickest way to become a millionaire is be a billionaire and buy an airline.

Thanks!  I just used bitinstant while I'm waiting for my bank to verify and it sucked.  Can't wait for coinbase!
@_date: 2012-11-23 23:51:20
why would you use two?  I signed up for coinbase and am waiting for my bank to verify. 
@_date: 2012-11-22 20:12:55
thanks homey!  I just looked at bit instant and the fee is 1.29% for transactions under 100 and .89 for over.  Is that considered a lot?

“I spent all mine on Silk Road in the run up to Coachella 2012.”

No diversification is bad.
@_date: 2018-07-03 03:01:29
Dad you really had 30 bitcoins for $300 and used them for weird things on Silk Road!?!?

So if I don't invest in a security that I deem to be a poor investement and then write out why I thought it was a poor investment you could then just respond with..."you're not trying to be helpful".  You just gave his comments even more of a boost with that craziness.

What was?
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:42:48
wow!  Cheers mate I appreciate the hand holding haha

It's probably more like blowing up a town to get the safe in the convenience store.

So you have a code reader on your phone attached to your wallet?
@_date: 2016-05-27 14:02:40
How does this work?  I had bitcoin in a wallet and made online purchases...how does it work in a store front?
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:38:00
I wish I could go back and not make those SR purchases for Coachella "fun" when Bitcoin was at $10.
