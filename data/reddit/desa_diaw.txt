We are all Satoshi Nakamoto... except CSW, of course.
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:31:00
Thank you.  :)

Thank you very much, Jonathan.

You were treating Marc Cuban to lunch...

How do the pools send the work? Or, receive completed work?

Wake me up when we hit $1500...

Musk apparently is building a crypto research facility.

CSW and CA are conmen. CSW is dangerous.  CA is an idiot.

I'm thinking more along the lines that the Bitcoin blockchain - however improbable - stops working. Software bug, developers revolt, external attack. 
Where does my tangible asset end up?
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:07:44
Where do the funds go that the new investor has just invested in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:38:07
Thank you. 
Ok, so there may be some chance of recovery, through a fork. How would this work?
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:37:35
I downloaded the book a few days ago, after listening to the author's interview with the head of the Mises Institute. 
Thank you.  :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:00:43
Those are very fair odds. :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:47:39
Thank you. So, we receive a fraction of a Bitcoin.
What exactly is this fraction of a Bitcoin, that we have purchased?
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:56:03
Thank you. :)
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:36:10
Can you perhaps exlain this, in a bit more detail? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 06:55:30
Now, if I may ask, what happens to my new tangible asset, recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, if this blockchain stops working, for some reason?
@_date: 2019-01-03 06:59:45
Ok, so there are around 80,000 witnesses to this tangible investment.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:54:49
Thank you. Stunning answer.
So, it is our contribution towards the Bitcoin system - a vote of confidence. Is that a fair summary?
@_date: 2019-01-03 06:57:24
Freedom - from what?
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:06:21
Assets shouldn't be bubbles, though. Sound investments should be linked to solid companies. :)
The speculative assets would be the same as buying the nebulous BTC token/label.
@_date: 2019-01-03 06:58:32
Yes, that seems to be true. Thank you. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:45:33
Thank you. It does seem that the Bitcoin blockchain is amazingly robust.
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:13:15
Very neat graph. I seem to remember seeing something similar some time back. 
Something feels so very wrong about that linear-log curve. Let me chew it over and find the logic flaw - it will be there. Basically the rising asset cost is scaled back via the log function. If only the rest of finance would scale the same way.
I'd really love to see the major historical bubbles plotted the same way - for comparison. ��

When an investor buys Bitcoin, what is he/she actually investing in?
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:43:55
When we purchase this Bitcoin, what do we actually receive, in return?
@_date: 2019-01-13 12:14:32
Yes, I do feel the same. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:51:44
Great. So we have purchased a tangible asset that is a % of the maximum 21 Million supply of Bitcoin.
We know that it is tangible, because it is recorded somewhere?
@_date: 2019-01-13 03:29:55
HODL if fine during the growth phase of a bubble. In the falling phase, care must be taken.
A useful exercise is to plot most crypto coins, over a long 'max', timeframe. The bubble effect applies to most. Compare to historic bubbles, for a visual.
What extends the tail for BTC seems to be:
1.  Miners balancing against their break-even point.
2.  Miners hoping for an up-swing.
3.  Whales using buy/sell walls to manipulate towards profit.
4.  Investors hoping for the next upswing - inverted Bart.
The historic charts appear to show that BTC is a bubble.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:08:59
What precisely is the Bitcoin investor buying?
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:45:57
Thank you. Excellent answer.
So, we are buying into/investing in, Bitcoin technology?
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:44:21
Thank you everyone who has contributed their thoughts, so far.
We've come fairly far in understanding what an investor understands we are purchasing, when we buy Bitcoin.
Now, lets move forwards a little.
When we invest in buying Bitcoin, how does our investment link back to the technology development team? 
Which team is the investor supporting?
How does the price we pay feed back into ongoing technology development? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:30:35
Oh dear - so, my tangible asset, indelibly recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain - ends up with zero value. Vaporware?
Is there any chance of recovery?
@_date: 2019-01-03 06:56:48
I tend to agree on fiat and where it seems to be heading.
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:33:17
Thank you, for your kind reply. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:28:54
It's poss8ble that we may see USD 1500 at the bottom. ��
