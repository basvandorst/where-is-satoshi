@_date: 2017-03-18 15:52:02
not sure if this will going up again

Have that ever happened before? I was introduced to bitcoin 1 month ago
@_date: 2017-04-02 02:02:15
When was the last time you paid for the gold? Because that fee is from March 21st
@_date: 2017-04-02 14:17:57
I wanted to send 5$ to charge my steam wallet.
I have 509k satoshis and it doesn't let me pay because I don't have enough money for the fee.
I have heard in a video that CoinPayments only asks 20k satoshi fee if you're making a small transaction and 10k if it's a bigger one. But I don't know if I should use that wallet,  I'd like to hear some user's experience first :P

No, that's why I'm asking, I mean, what would happen if I have just 0.005 BTC and I want to send them all to another wallet to buy a game, will it just don't let me send it?

The problem is that I can't verify my PayPal account :'(

I don't want to use coinbase anymore but which wallet should I use?
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:22:00
blockchain takes away a certain amount of money that you receive from pages (faucets)
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:22:59
To be exact I had to send 486k, leaving me with a balance of 23k still not enough for the fee
@_date: 2017-06-08 13:50:04
I have that small amount because I already changed my wallet and I'd rather spend the sat I still have on coinbase instead of transfering them to my other wallet since I would lose near of the half in only fees
you dumbass
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:40:01
don't use coinbase unless you want to spend 1$+ from frees 
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:42:18
don't use coinbase
the fee is fucking insane, is currently more than 1 dollar right now
I'm still using it because I need to spend the 295k satoshis I have in, I already changed my wallet but I won't lose 50-75k from only fees, fuck it
@_date: 2017-06-08 04:39:07
the fucking coinbase fee is insane
I need to retire 243k satoshis (because I changed my wallet),  I have 295k and this fucking shit doesn't let me to
so it's aprox 52k satoshis from fees, (1,3$)
FUCKING THIEVES
