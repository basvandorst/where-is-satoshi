44.  I used to be up over 100 pretty regularly.   Not entirely sure what's changed.

I've been banging the table for the last year at people telling them that if they wanted in, now was the time (while we were hovering around 5k).   I was buying a couple times a month, but no one else would pull the trigger, finally a friend bought $200 worth from me at 11,500.    
This pattern has repeated I believe 5 times now.   It's almost like clockwork now.

 [   
Throw the IP address and select port 8333.   It'll tell you if it's open.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:56:27
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:11:35
Have you run a port check to ensure that 8333 is open and responding?    
Also, has the blockchain fully downloaded, IIRC, it won't start accepting incoming connections until it has the blockchain downloaded.

I personally don't keep any in the exchanges.      
Exchanges can get hacked, or become defunct.   (see Mt. Gox, Binance, Coinbase)  
I feel much safer keeping my BTC in my personal wallet at home.   Even if you run a node, your small fish and most likely no one is going to bother trying to break into your wallet.

This happened to me.  You have to redownload the entire blockchain.     
Run bitcoin from a command prompt being ran as administrator and add the -reindex argument to it.    Or go to your shortcut, right click it, go to properties, and add -reindex to the end of the "target" within the quotations   
Target : "....\\bitcoin.exe -reindex"  
Once you've done that once, go back in and remove the reindex flag, or it'll redownload the blockchain every time you open bitcoin.

You can run your own stratum pool.  This is what I'm doing for HamRadioCoin when Ispace takes a dump.
Granted... it takes a windows machine.  But it works.

Is there a BFGminer port for Bitmain?  I ran your BFGminer back when I was using getwork asics and GPU, then got out for a while and came back with Antminers.

For the same reason that banks had to close during the recession.   A run on the bank (exchange) could mean that the exchange is unable to pay its debts back to the users if they get enough users at once wanting their money/BTC.

Not an option here.  Cash or check is the only way to pay our utilities in my town, and I hate it.  Literally every other bill I have is paid online or is automatically debited to my account.

I don't see how if I don't give you any of the connections that I currently have established.

If mining ceases.... bitcoin dies.
I don't ever see this happening though, at least not in our lifetime. 
After all of the bitcoins are in circulation, then the miners will be rewarded with only the TX fees.  
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:21:05
I'm in the same boat.  I don't even bother checking the price usually anymore.  $300?  Cool... $1300?  Cool.  
Then again, I'm also not a day trader.
@_date: 2015-09-26 07:09:34
I don't think I realized that option existed.  Last time I used it was with an Asicminer blade and had to use the http-port option to use it as a stratum proxy.    If I would have known I could have done it that way I would have been doing it that way from the beginning for my HamRadioCoin backup.
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:28:24
Yes.   If something were to happen and Coinbase were to become compromised, and every last BTC was drained from their coffers.  There's no way they would have the capital to recoup that loss.  They would more than likely go under, and anyone that had anything there would be left out in the cold.  
How likely is this scenario?  Honestly I don't know. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 16:41:15
My node right now is consuming &gt; 5Gb of memory... I've never seen it get this high.   Yesterday is was hovering around 4.2
@_date: 2015-10-28 17:49:06
That's true... But I'm liking this sideways movement of today.  
Looking at the 30 day, it looks like the price was trying to do a parabolic jump, like it did 2 years ago.   I'd be happy if we sat here at $300 and just let it cool off before moving much if any higher.   
Slow stable growth is what we need if we don't want to be seen as a flash in the pan like so  many outsiders saw bitcoin as 2 years ago.  
I would hope that consolidation could happen closer to $280, but that's being optimistic.   If I wanted to be really optimistic I'd say that we'd go sideways for a month and have all of the consolidation here... but that's more of a pipe dream than being analytical.
Just my 2 bits.

It's up for debate.   It's for the people that will try to get a second mortgage on their house to buy, or their rent/food money.   Seems silly to most people, but there are people that have and still do it.  
This is something you'll hear in any market especially volitile, be it BTC or penny stocks.

I know I'm not being throttled as I am the ISP tech, and the quality of my connection is enterprise grade.  I'm leaning more towards the speed of the hardware.  It's my File server, DHCP, DNS, and has a few other services running on it too.  I guess I'll find out for sure when my new processor gets here for my upgrade.
@_date: 2015-11-15 16:23:03
Oh no!  It sounds like a standard investment with a 5 year turn around instead of a 45 year turn around... whatever will we do?!

I'm not entirely sure.  I've also noticed that I haven't been the first relay in a tx since the 1st.   I've restarted my node since the first and show 70+ connections...
@_date: 2015-11-11 17:40:50
I know it would be tough now. But if you have the TXID's you may be able to get them to credit your account by contacting support.   I was able to do this with Betarigs when my account glitched hardcore.
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:31:21
Not just that, but if they were to take 10s of thousand BTC and convert it at market price, it would cause the market to drop, therefore, they're losing money, not to mention if they did it all at once, it could cause a flash crash.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:21:56
Usually yes.  However if a 300 trade is made, and then someone puts in a sell order below 300, the ask now becomes under 300.
@_date: 2015-10-26 17:44:26
That's my fault ... I stopped reading at the first line, due to that being all I could see on my mobile.  
So, yes, exactly what you said.
@_date: 2015-10-30 14:48:16
For the most part no.  However most of our debit cards are linked to checking accounts because banks here will charge you fees for too many withdrawls of a savings account.  I write one check every month because my utility company refuses to accept cards.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:33:13
I didn't know we could do this...  Running a full node has advantages that I didn't know about yet. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:03:27
My whole purpose for the mobile wallet is to easily accept bitcoin for wares.  At the end of the day, they all get funneled into my cold storage, or into the wallet on my node that has 3 backups.

I'm curious as to why I never see up to 125 connections.  My firewall allows over 1200 concurrent connections at a time, and I never seem to hit close to that.  
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:58:51
Now that we've solidly planted above 300... Beings that it was resistance for so long, even if just a mental resistance, it should now become our support line.
Looks like our resistances from here up are at every $10 increment. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 19:40:36
Find me.  I challenge you.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:20:49
This has been a major resistance for us for sometime now it seems.   If we can get above it and stay above it for a bit, it should become our new support level.

As someone that just got into bitcoins recently (i.e. 2 days ago)  I started looking into the butterfly labs stuff... I had no idea that they were within 2 hours of me.  I may have to go down and see them.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:09:39

@_date: 2013-04-12 02:07:10
Posted 2 days ago... we have plenty of time.  Everything will be fine.  If things don't get better by tomorrow... we should probably all hide from lalicat for a while.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:44:39
We could all only hope.  I just got into researching bitcoins and mining a few days ago.   For where I'm starting, this this whole bubble pop for me is something great I think, I do really feel bad for all of the people that bought in at over $100 at this point.  However, I've done the same thing with the stock market, live and die by rule 1, which we've all read probably 50 times by now with this situation.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:21:05
I think it's a pretty fair guess as well.  That would put it back around the average.  Look at what the market did in 2008.  Plummeted, and then worked it's way back to the average growth.  Same thing the other way, exponential growth, and then drop back to mean growth.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:13:52
Really... they're not bad rules to follow.
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:30:37
That would make sense, except that this is an off grid setup, with an oversized array that is already purchased, so the electricity can't be sold back.  So the electricity is free.  
Regardless.  It's bought, paid for, shipped, and should be here this week.  Since that's already done, I'm going to go ahead and run it.  FOR SCIENCE!
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:15:02
The real reason I'm curious about this is I'm looking into a joint venture mining with my boss, as he and I are the only 2 in the company that know anything about them.  Power and hardware will cost us nothing,  but I didn't/don't want to build a powerhouse mining rig if BFL is actually capable of making good on all of their preorders, which would make our rig obsolete within the first month or 2.
Honestly, we'd probably pre-order a couple BFL ASICs if I knew enough about the company to be comfortable with them.
*EDIT* And now seeing on Ebay, people are selling their preorders for a higher price in order to essencially line jump in the queue.  The 5 Ghash/s machines are going for nearly twice their pre-order price.  This makes me even more leery of BFL.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:40:01
Increased?  It went from .05 to .01 recently.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:11:47
Regardless, Bitcoin has recovered from each of those crashes.  stronger than ever every time.

I've started buying asicminer blades.  Luckily they're going to be powered via solar for the most part.  My plan is to acquire a new blade every month until I fill an entire backplane, from then I'll see where I stand.
