Man, even if it was an insider, they should prepare and have measures in place to prevent this. The technology is here with Bitcoin and proper procedures on how to store it securely is well known. There had to be multiple failures along the line for something like this to occur.
A fiat bank wouldn't put all it's cash in a damn draw with the teller, no, they'd put that shit in a vault. Why is it that every time one of these exchanges get robbed it's like a vending machine shooting out money. 
If multi-sig is implemented correctly then no exchange should ever have full control of your funds, shouldn't be able to move a penny of your shit without their consent. Then the attackers would not only have to compromise the exchange, but also each individual customer it planned to rob.
Why in the fuck do Exchanges keep choosing to run their business with all these liabilities by holding onto Customer's funds solely? This is idiotic. The last thing I would want to do is be the sole target for all of these funds and ultimately the sole one responsible. I personally don't like holding money that is not mine, I don't want to be held responsible if something happens to it. If I was an exchange right now, I would do my damn best to figure out a different way to conduct business without having to be the one holding all the damn money. We already know it can be done.

The company clearly fucked up, people just don't get $70,000,000 dollars stolen. Come on. 
This should not have been possible, period. Let me restate that, this should not have been possible. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:15:18
What the fuck is the point of using BitGo at this point? 
Obviously the way they implement their shit is totally fucked up. Looks more like a dumbass "Certified" or "Approved By" sticker. 
All that company did was further the incompetence of Bitfinex by lulling customers into a false sense of security here. Maybe customers wouldn't have trusted the platform with so much money if they didn't stamp their bullshit approval on it.
Because no matter what, obviously the shit wasn't secure.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:12:20
Customer base? The customers are going to salvage what they can and never return to this joke of a place. All trust and hope is lost at this point.
That's like wanting to be a patient for a Doctor who just killed all his previous patients by accident. It's safe to say, that Doctor is no longer a doctor, or should be for that matter.
They fucking failed, and spectacularly at that. This whole Security Theater bullshit with BitGo lulled people into a false sense of safety and having them think their shit was safe there.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:17:48
Yeah, that would be an amazing deal for both sides. If only the attacker could somehow have reassurance of not being prosecuted, but I don't think this is possible, especially considering human nature. 
If the guy gives the money back or not, he's still enemy  right now.

Wow, yeah.. Purse just definitely shit all over this complaint.. no way the counter-party had their ID.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:50:56
Yeah, all those exchanges they bought were waaaaaaaayyyy less than this.
This is like buying a burnt down building that will cost you $70,000,000 to take down, then build a new structure on top of it.
The other exchanges stand to profit more by just letting this place fall apart, the customers will come to them anyways.
This is a very shitty situation, but it just goes to show that the whole system is fucked up. We have the technology in Bitcoin, it is totally possible for exchanges to OFFLOAD all of this massive risk by utilizing Multisig CORRECTLY. They choose not to, because then they wouldn't be in control of the funds (not having any power).
This whole BitGo thing is a fucking shame, what was the point? Security Theater at it's **best.**
The only reason I would see any other exchanges stepping in to try and manage this catastrophe would be to save face for Bitcoin as a whole. I don't see this happening though, these doomsday scenarios happen all the time, it just makes the other competitors bigger. We've seen it with Bitcoin Exchanges and we've seen it with the darknet markets.

There was no cold storage. Cold storage means not connected to the damn internet, thus no signing.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:01:07
Man, come on, dollars get robbed and stolen all the time.
The thing here is simple, people left their money with an incompetent individual / business. 
The procedures here are just plain fucked up, it's like instead of having a bank vault with all the cash, just put the shit in the draw with the tellers. 
It is not like this is some hard to solve problem with securing these funds. The majority of all the funds on this exchange were not going in and out, you need to keep a damn bare minimum online that is able to be instantly signed / zapped away. You should honestly have to refill that shit 10x a day.
If Bitcoin Exchanges are going to have the damn security and business model of a vending machine, then they need to start leaving a whole lot less in the damn machine.

Check out Localbitcoins.com volume over time. They are arguably one of the most influential exchanges. When a buy/sell happens, money actually changes hands, rather than digital dollars being updated in an internal ledger.

Unfortunately there is a thing known as civil asset forfeiture. If they have reasonable suspicion then they can just seize your money, and then *you* have to prove that you obtained those legally. 
No criminal charges may be pursued when they do this, but you still lose all your dough. It's some bullshit laws that they utilize to seize money in the "War on Drugs" and cash.
So the question is, can you sign a message using the Bitcoin Address that mined those Bitcoins.
Also this would work the same way with Cash as well. If you have a million dollars in your trunk worth of fiat, get pulled over, then you'd be in the same position. They'd seize the money using CAF and you would have to prove how you legally obtained this amount of money. In most scenarios, the amount seized is normally just a handful of thousand bucks. After an average citizen has his funds seized to the tune of a few thousand dollars, he's in a tight spot to even be able to hire efficient legal counsel that will fight to get his funds back. It may end up costing more than what he would be returned in the first place. 
I don't agree with any of this shit and how it works, but unfortunately it is how the system works.

1% over spot? Doesn't sound like much margins, especially when you got to pay the female PR lady, oh yeah, not to mention yank back the referral bonuses. People put in work for those referrals, and last time I checked, real gold doesn't get erased.
And why is that crazy that I think they should ask and obtain everything they need before accepting money? Is this a mouse trap for money or a legitimate business? A bank wouldn't let me put money in an account before I actually had a verified account. Which we all know about the downfall of banks, but at least they give you all the fine print upfront. 
It's not about so much of proving your identity, which I mean, still come on no good reason too, I mean they ship the gold to your damn house. Last time I checked I didn't need to give my first born son away or give blood in order for the USPS man to deliver me mail. 
And the old "oh, if you don't have anything to hide then why do you care?" phrase, what a joke. There is a reason that houses are made out of walls instead of glass, I hope you can guess the first one.

Bitcoin users do love unregulated trade and finance, but the problem is they get lulled by companies pretending to be "Regulated, Compliant, and Honest™". 
All these fly by night companies with an awesome Board of Shills need to be treated just like the bottom feeding forum scammers they are.
Sending to shit companies like this is not any different than sending to shit scammers on forums and such, people just need to realize this.  The people who have fucked Bitcoiners the most were always the ones who were "Legit, Regulated, Compliant"... cough *GAW, Mt. Gox, BFL, Cryptsy, Neo &amp; Bee, Bitcoinica... I could go on forever...*
No one would trust a random user on the internet with their Bitcoin, so people need to realize that these fucking companies are the same, they're random users on the internet who just completed an online filing to get a business name registered. Oh, wait, I forgot they spent $50 at GoDaddy.com too, so they could get up a sweet website.

Then why the fuck they stealing $10,000 dollars and yanking back referral bonuses?
They got nothing but the bullshit they are feeding you with a spoon.
They don't have a million active customers, get that bullshit out of here. They need to decide if they want to sell gold, scam investors, or scam customers. You can order whatever amount of gold you want from ProvidentMetals with Bitcoin, cheaper too, just give them a mailing address. 
So why not come up with a reason why they don't generate a deposit address until after you verify the account? Why would they even want to have to deal with the burden of filing reports, handling funds, and all the other bullshit when someone doesn't ID themselves? It's because they don't want you to ID yourself after you put money in. They want to rob you, simple shit.

Okay, spout off with the excuses and then try and turn it into an advertisement, whatever. If you want to pretend you are a legitimate high-growth omg company then start acting like one.
Banks don't setup accounts for people and let them drop their life savings into it before making people sign papers. I mean they suck, but they are pretty up front about how the process works.
Send the guy back his Bitcoin at least, I mean shit. Even Coinbase lets you get your damn Bitcoin out when they decide to shut you down or reject your shit.
How about making someone verify all their bullshit BEFORE generating them a deposit address? Oh, wait, I know why. You don't do that because you would literally lose 95% of ALL INCOMING DEPOSITS.

This is completely bullshit. They could send the guy back his Bitcoin and continue pretending like they are a legitimate financial instution and the police.
They allow anyone anytime to start dumping tons of Bitcoin to them by providing deposit addresses. It's awfully funny they don't ask for all of your private sensitive information and first born until you go to get your money back. It's simple why they do this, they're a shit company trying to steal funds under the guise of "AML/KYC" bullshit. This is similar to how Mt. Gox was not sending wires out because of "the traditional financial system" and Roger Ver getting on video and giving the whole spill to buy more time. This is completely unacceptable.
For the guys who are going to be like: "Ohh.. but investigation... crime.. yada.."
That's complete bullshit. So owning $10,000 in Bitcoin is suspicious and now it is your job to steal that money? Sure, it may be your responsibility to report suspicious activities, yeah, we get that, but stealing funds is different. Look up the hackers from Sheep Marketplace, they sold millions to Coinbase. Coinbase filed SARs and alerted relevant authorities like how they should, but they still proceeded to let the users have access to their funds, especially Bitcoin. Anytime Coinbase shuts a users account down they let the user withdraw their Bitcoin out.
This company is a sham, if you aren't up to date on what this company is about just do a little Google-fu about their whole referral scam. All these new users and registrations they were boasting about were simply people trying to cash in on a referral bonus. This referral bonus was just an elaborate marketing scam because the company actually took back the vast majority of bonuses from it's users! Sounds scammy to me!
They claim millions of users, but I've been trading in Bitcoin for years and I don't know a single respectable Bitcoin trader/user who uses this place. They don't even have a fucking business model for crying out loud. Just take a look at the numbers and financials of their last quarterly reportings. Wasn't too long ago that they even claimed an overall financial loss, probably why they are stealing referral bonuses back from their customers.
I hate regulation and overzealous compliance just as much as anyone, but these new criminals fly that flag to pretend to be legitimate while fleecing all it's customers. Do a crowd fund / IPO just to raise ad money to get your scam out there to rob everyone. The reason we even have these regulations is because shit companies like this.
So go ahead and send the PR lady in to do damage control again, go ahead and pay her this weeks profits from the company to keep this shit under control or you could maybe just steal some referral bonuses back to pay her salary too.
@_date: 2016-06-03 07:24:44
We're talking about bitcoin, this lesson is called risk awareness and avoidance.
Shit is simple guy, you don't generate a deposit address for your Customer until you have whatever the fuck it is you need and then approve them for an account. So why would they not do this? It's because they know people won't put money into their ponzi scheme if people had to be molested like that in the beginning.

Bro, come on. Coinbase paid out millions of dollars to the people who stole the Sheep Marketplace coins. They never froze the funds or anything.
This is a blatant deceptive tactic used to steal and manipulate customers. They are probably running a fractional reserve.
It's funny they had no problem accepting more deposits, it wasn't a problem until they went to withdraw.
Also "links to darknet" is a bullshit excuse. It takes real proof before you go stealing people's shit, and even if they were tainted (which it's likely every Bitcoin is tainted.. i mean come on.. only a limited supply) it doesn't mean he is associated with them.

These guys don't even have a legitimate business plan. The 1% won't even pay for the damn PR lady to get on here and do damage control for her co-workers. They're so damn sketchy they steal a few dollars they promised you for bringing new victims to the site.
And as I stated before and I'll state again.. They should require everything they want up front before generating a deposit address for a customer. Why in the fuck would they not do this? It's simple, the scam conversion rate of deposits would drop like an anchor in the ocean. I mean shit, come on man. This is elementary shit, stop shilling out.
I mean Coinbase doesn't even do this shit, they at least let you get your Bitcoin out after they close your account. 
This whole hold shit for X amount of days is just bullshit legacy financial system jargon. The only reason legitimate financial institutions hold funds is because they are the ones at risk if shit is reversed or charged back, this doesn't happen with Bitcoin. They could file SARs, call the feds, or just keep pretending they are financial investigators AFTER they send the funds back to the owner. I mean look, Coinbase cashed out millions of dollars from the kid hackers who stole all the funds from Sheep Marketplace. You know what they did? They filed a SAR and went on with their fucking day instead of pretending to be the police or investigators.

@_date: 2016-05-22 00:19:04
Are you buying or selling?
Sometimes you just have to be vigilant on watching for ads on LBC. For instance, from time to time I purchase Bitcoin @ 1% below spot via CBM in amounts up to $50,000. My ad doesn't stay up long (maybe an hour?) because other users see the good deal and quickly initiate a trade.
You actually should create your own ad on LBC instead of replying to others. Set the rate that you would like to purchase or sell at as well as the payment method. This is the best way to go about it.
Using services such as Bitquick puts you at their mercy. If something fucks up, it's completely up to them to see how they handle it. You also are susceptible to 3 letter agencies getting the down low on all of your transactions. Any company that is operating in the USA (Coinbase, Kraken, etc) are all obliged to hand over every damn single detail they have about you. They go above and beyond what a regular financial institution would give when it comes to handing over it's customers records just so they can stay in good graces. 
I guess it's up to you to decide what you need in a transaction. Everything has a trade-off. If you want fast and convenient, then Coinbase might be for you. If you choose to use Coinbase then you are at risk of losing your account at any minute, very limited buy amounts (don't plan on buying more than a few thousand a week!), and no privacy whatsoever. If you want privacy and a good rate, then you are going to be dealing with another individual who is in the same position as you, except he needs the opposite of what you do (selling or buying). Depending on who you are dealing with, this can be a pain in the ass.
Go ahead and setup some ads on Localbitcoins or Paxful, you'll be surprised at the activity of peer-to-peer Bitcoin exchanges. It is how Bitcoin was originally intended to be used, unlike these wannabe quazi-PayPal services.
