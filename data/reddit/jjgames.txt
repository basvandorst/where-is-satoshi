Curious, how you chose the locations?  The one in Denver seems kind of random but I know nothing about the market.

There is no listing fee or sales fee.  Nothing is paid to the marketplace.  
  
There is a 0.5% fee charged by our payment processor.  That doesn't go to us though that goes to Stripe, our payment processor.  
  
Sorry for any confusion.

This is a good point. I don't think the same thing would happen with a fiat currency.  
Do you think the increase in spending is just caused by publicity?  People decide to spend the currency because they are reminded they own some?
 
Maybe an increased wealth effect?
