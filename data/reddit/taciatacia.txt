From the article:




But if you can break the device (implying physical access), why can't you get a fingerprint from the user (obviously not far) and sign with the server second key?

you mean like replacing the firmware by a rogue one, waiting for the user to swipe, and sending all bitcoins to yourself?
But I guess it's not possible to change the firmware unless it's signed by Case, like Trezor.

It's not really multisig as two keys are related to a single point of failure: access to the user. 
Imagine that you know someone with a Case containing 10 BTC:
1. take a fingerprint (on a glass or whatever) and build a fake print
2. get access to the Case and empty it in one minute
Real multisignature requires a hacker to get simultaneous access to at least two different devices (your computer and your phone, or your phone and one hardware wallet, or two different hardware wallet).
Can someone explain me the merits of such choice of architecture because I'm at a loss.

What happens if I lose/break my Case, and that when I reach out to you to recover my key with my fingerprint, you do not exist anymore? 
Does it mean I must monitor the survival of your company, and immediately empty my Case if I suspect you are going bankrupt?
