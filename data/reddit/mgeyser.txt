If bitcoin were actually being used as a currency it wouldn’t ever change price. 1 bitcoin will always equal 1 bitcoin. People measure the value of bitcoin in terms of the currency they want to use. If you measure USD by it’s value in bitcoin it’s just as volatile. 
Bitcoin won’t be a successful currency until it is popular enough to be accepted by at a minimum 20% of the everyday vendors you would normally purchase goods from. At that point it won’t be volatile like it is today, but we are a long long ways off.

If it’s under $100 you are fine leaving it on coinbase. When it becomes substantial consider moving it to a paper or hardware wallet

Bitcoin doesn’t require any specific amount of electricity. The amount it burns is based on the number of people who choose to mine it. The number doesn’t make transactions any quicker. No matter how big bitcoin gets there will never be a minimum hash power required.

You have a good point. Indexing yourself among many other commodities is a better judge of volatility than comparing against only one. But I still believe that there is a scenario in which bitcoin becomes less volatile than currencies like the bolivar within the next 10 years. That won’t happen unless it becomes adopted globally by at least 20% of anyone who accepts payment for business, be it b2b or b2c. But at that point I would argue that certain countries will greatly prefer it to their own national currency, but the well regarded currencies you speak of will be the last to adopt it fully due to their strength of national economy.

Not sure how this is relevant to my comment. Can you explain please?
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:53:21
The point isn’t that you are stealing the commodity itself, it is that you are stealing the VALUE of the commodity.

Sounds like you’ve gotten lucky and are just hoping to do it again. Why 5k and not now? It’s down 50% from a few months ago. Seems like trying to rely on luck to me...

Paintings aren’t fungible. Your argument has no validity.

You are mostly right but that isn't always the case. Sometimes the fed buys back securities from financial institutions using bookkeeping entries into their reserve accounts. In the case of Quantitative Easing programs they were not borrowing this money. They were using newly printed money (digitally of course). 
If I could suggest two pieces of reading before you write your reply they would be these two articles:
The second one should be very relatable, but the first has more in depth info on the subject.

But that was the whole point of my comment. Yet he responded as though I was saying something different. And he did so in a juvenile manner. People here really need to learn civil discourse and reading comprehension.

It could certainly use a lot more usage as a currency, but the overall metrics have all been rising. Number of people mining bitcoin (hashpower), number of transactions, number of wallets created, and even ancillary metrics: number of wallet providers, number of exchanges, number of merchants accepting it, the number of people subscribing to reddit and other crypto news services. And I’m sure all of the above will continue to grow. 
I feel you are focusing too heavily on number of people purchasing it.

It feels different because its value is based on network effects. It’s the same reason people couldn’t wrap their heads around Twitter IPO with no revenues but billions in valuation. The internet has changed the valuation paradigm and bitcoin is an extreme example of that. The value is in the network! 
@_date: 2019-12-15 07:36:52
Honestly though if everyone worth $100k put a fast food meal worth of money into bitcoin that would be pretty amazing and I think A substantial amount of money. Especially if everyone worth 25k put just a dollar in. 
At least they would be learning about it and using it. And we should encourage any use of it in my opinion.

The idea is that he has other things he could do with his day to earn more than 1 cent / 24 hours. He might even have a way to spend his time that earns him more than stopping to pick up a $100/bill. Probably not true, but still possible. You are right to subtract the truly “passive” income.
@_date: 2019-04-22 17:47:34
This is a concept more people need to understand.
@_date: 2019-12-03 08:23:41
Let’s just say you are constantly being given the choice by trails of money to either pick up $110 or $100. In order to gain the most amount of money, you would continually skip out on picking up the $100 in order to gain the $110. Thus, you are in a sense losing it, but still gaining more money in the process.

I was going to give you a well thought response until you typed hurrr in quotes as if I said it. You are clearly immature so I’ll just point you to google. It’s really not hard to find useful value cases for bitcoin if you spend 10 minutes reading about it. Reddit is hardly the forum for lengthy discussions.

Thank you for your service.

Crypto produces value for anyone trying to send small amounts of money to the other side of the planet. And that’s just one type of value it produces...
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:20:02
Assuming the software never improves this would be true. The software is already being improved upon. The holding value part is kind of silly, it’s an emerging market it can’t go slowly and steadily up. Look at the long term trend. When it’s actually used as a global currency it will be more stable.

Well that’s a stretch. It’s matter of fact that you will lose on average in Vegas, in fact you are very unfavored. There is nothing to suggest the odds of a crypto investment. Now whether you believe the odds of crypto are in your favor or not doesn’t matter. What matters is there is an extremely distinct difference.

It’s 10k now so it only fucked them if they sold
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:34:19
I think you should look up the expected value formula and definition. Your odds of a return are based on the total number of outcomes and how likely those outcomes are. In Vegas every game you bet a dollar you have an EV of less than a dollar. In roulette if you put a dollar on red your EV is $0.947. In crypto this is far less black and white. But even so, insinuating that only 1 out of 1300 cryptos will be a good bet is a bit ridiculous when you consider the overall growth of the space and that very few people have lost money if they have stayed in the market for a few years, regardless of their coin choice. I don’t think it will always be that way, and every coin certainly will not survive. But a healthy diversified portfolio in well researched products is not comparable to a weekend in Vegas.

Good thing it’s a censorship resistant currency...

I think it’s easy too! But it’s not convenient. I can easily carry a credit card around and any shop will swipe it for money. I carry a hardware wallet around and pretty much no one will accept the currencies stored on it for anything.

The number of miners has nothing to do with the transaction speed. The algorithm self adjusts based on the total hash power(I.e. number of miners) so that blocks come in on an average time of 10min per block and each block is a fixed size. Fees are based on usage. Because block size and time is fixed, if more people want to use the network then the network can process those people have to start out bidding each other to get their transactions chosen for processing.

What percentage would you say? Hard to put a figure on I’m sure but would love an estimate. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:10:53
Try to get someone to believe that your bitcoin cash is a real bitcoin and pay you the same for it. I don’t believe you could do it. But if you can please tell me and I’ll make us both rich ;)

That seems way easier than comparisons to USD. I have my new reference for explaining bitcoins value. Thanks!

This is how market sentiment changes over time. Patience on the buy side is rewarded during bear markets. When patience stops being rewarded people start to fomo. Sorry for the random response I just find it all so fascinating.
