I think anonymity and privacy should be baked into the protocols of the Internet, so that anyone can run any web-site that contains anything, and not fear government intrusion.
It would be great if the government did the right thing simply because it's the right thing to do. Instead we have to use tools like:
- encryption
- TOR
- VPN
- DNS over https
- public key pinning
- cryptocurrency
- blockchain
to drag governments, *kicking and screaming*, into doing the right thing.

I like the idea of the technology.
I like the ideal of a decentralized currency where everyone helps participate. Buying and selling Bitcoin on a trading site is not participating in the technology. Mining is participating in the technology. Add with Bitcoin I cannot mine.
Once it was discovered that you could use a GPU to mine Bitcoin, the developers should have migrated to a stronger hashing algorithm - to ensure that the average individual can still contribute on their CPU. I want the digital currency that has a difficult to prove easy to verify algorithm. I want it so that GPUs and ASICs cannot be used.
The LiteCoin people understood that, and moved to the well-known memory hard function **scrypt** in 2011. And while they had valid reasons for choosing it to only require 128 KiB of RAM (e.g. it fits entirely in the L2 CPU cache, helping it run as fast as possible on the CPU), it only requires 128 KiB on RAM. This means that it could still be very parallelizable.
It **should** be 2  GiB of RAM.
- you not going to get custom ASIC advantage when you need to randomly access 2 GB of RAM
- video card bus bandwidth is such a throttle that it's doesn't help that your video card has 8 GB of RAM
- for someone with a modern desktop, two gigabytes of RAM out of your 24 is not that much to sacrifice to the cause
- the Google password hashing competition realized that it is the feeling of ram at maximum RAM bandwidth where are CPUs have their advantage
- fill RAM at maximum bus bandwidth with a very fast, very simple, hashing algorithm, optimized for x64 instruction set (rather than the various ad-hoc algorithms that scrypt internally uses)
- malware would not be able to hide 2 GB of RAM usage
- the appropriate verifier algorithm which makes it easy to verify, and difficult to prove
Ideally the Litecoin guys would admit the issues they have, note that their chosen parameters and chosen algorithm of a scrypt didn't work out in preventing the emergence of custom minors, and retune for a more egalitarian algorithm.
- There are other coins that try to thwart ASICs
- but they all still in embrace gpus
I want the coin that goes all in on fairness, equality, and a decentralized currency that everyone with a CPU can participate in.
**Edit:** Bonus Reading
- [Argon2 and Egalitarian Computing](
Equihash was an earlier algorithm by the same authors. All equihash-based coins like the *idea* of making BitCoin decentralized again. But none of them want to kill off video-cards as miners. That would probably make too many with hardware investments grumpy.

The problem happens when the bank fails, and nobody will accept those bank notes. I've now lost my entire savings.
With a central bank, everyone will accept the currency notes, because everyone uses the same currency notes.
It is on par with me dumping all my money into SploogeCoin, and suddenly nobody will accept SploogeCoins. We need to standardize on one digital fiat coin.

The problem happens when you have multiple people trying to update the balance. The problem is that in order to change the balance, even a human on paper, would have to:
- read the current balance
- subtract 100 from that value
- write the new balance
Now imagine you and i are both updating the balance. You want to subtract `100`, i want to subtract `0.01`:
    Balance  You                    Me                  
    =======  =====================  ========================
       1000  
             Read current balance  
             balance=1000
                                    Read current balance
                                    balance=1000
             Subtract 100
             newBalance=1000-100
                       =900
                                    Subtract 1
                                    newBalance=1000-0.01
                                              =999.99
        900  Update balance to 900
                                    Update balance to 999.99
     999.99
This same problem would happen if two of us were updating values in ink on paper.
The solution is to take exclusive access to the balance. Nobody else is even allowed to *look at it*, while i'm doing my subtraction:
     Balance  You                    Me                  
     =======  =====================  ========================
        1000  
              Acquire X lock
     1000(X)  X lock acquired
              Read current balance  
              balance=1000
                                     Acquire X lock
                                     Blocked on other process
              Subtract 100
              newBalance=1000-100
                        =900
                                     
       900(X) Update balance to 900
          900 Release X lock
       900(X)                        X lock acquired
                                     Read current balance
                                     balance=900
                                     Subtract 0.01
                                     newBalance=900-0.01
                                               =899.99
    899.99(X)                        Update balance to 999.99
       899.99                        Release X lock
Concurrency is such a horrendeously hard thing to get right. It's why the smart developers know not to try to use threads. The smart developers are smart enough that getting concurrency issues correct is extraordinarily difficult.
- 
**Edit**: A downside of such a lock is that it kills system performance. People cannot read a value, even if they have no intention of doing a calculation based on it. Another technique might be to have people who are allowed to `Read` the balance, as long as they swear they will not do anything with that calculation. Now we can restore the ability to "see" the old value for people who just need to see it. If they want to update it, they must first acquire the `Exclusive` lock.
Another technique is *Lock-free*, but wastes resources.
- read the balance: 1,000
- subtract my amount: 1000-0.01 = 999.99
- Swap the current balance with the new balance, only if the old balance is still `1000`
- If the swap failed, it means someone updated the balance behind our back. Read the new balance and try again.
**Lock Free**
The real trick is the atomic swap operation.
    DebitAccount(amount)
    {
       oldBalance = CurrentBalance;
       newBalance = oldBalance - amount;
       
       //Swap the new balance in, but only if the Balance is still oldBalance
       //This function will replace Balance with newBalance,
       //but only if Balance is still the oldBalance.
       //The function returns the original value of Balance
       if (InterlockedCompareExchange(Balance, newBalance, oldBalance) != oldBalance)
       {
          //Balance was updated behind our back. Redo the calculation
          //This is a downside of opportunistic "lock-free" locking, we
          //may have to waste resources doing the same calculation again
          while (true)
          {
             oldBalance = CurrentBalance;
             newBalance = oldBalance - amount;
             if (InterlockedCompareExchange(Balance, newBalance, oldBalance) == oldBalance)
             {
                //We finally managed to swap in the new balance. We're done
                break;
             }
          }
       }
    }
We allow multiple readers, but we risk wasting a calculation. If the calculation is difficult, or we don't want to suffer a denial of service attack, a lock-free algorithm might not be useful.
We use the Windows primitive [`InterlockedCompareExchange`]( which generates a memory barrier instruction in the CPU. This only works in memory, but all relational databases work in-memory anyway. The data is only saved to the hard drive during periodic checkpoints.
**SQL database**
If you were just using SQL Server, and wanted the safe *balance update* code, we start with the **BAD** code:
    UPDATE Accounts
    SET Balance = Balance - 100
    WHERE AccountNumber = 12345
This has the concurrency race condition. We need to hold a lock on the account balance so that nobody else can read it while we update:
    UPDATE Accounts WITH(HOLDLOCK)
    SET Balance = Balance - 100
    WHERE AccountNumber = 12345
Concurrency is an **extraordinarily** difficult problem to solve, or even recognize. It is perfectly understandable how anyone would get:
    balance = balance - 100
wrong.

The accusation is that a company *"controls"* Mike Hearn.
That means that Mike Hearn does not believe what he's saying - that he's being controlled.
- that he actually believes that the 1 MB block limit is a good thing
- that he actually does not believe that the block limit should be raised
- that he actually believes that people should be able to reverse their transactions 
- that he actually believes that higher fees is the solution to transaction volume
- that he actually believes that 14 hour wait times is not unreasonable
Someone isn't being controlled when they are speaking their mind. It just means they have an opinion different from yours.
I just **really** hate when people cry *shill* - as if the possibility that people can have different opinions never occurred to them. It's a pet peeve of mine.
**Edit**: people get so in love with their crypto currency that they'll do anything to defend it. BitCoin is a great idea, and the world would be better off to rally around one currency. But at the same time the downside of BitCoin was that it chose SHA256 as the proof of work. SHA is easily  parallelizable in hardware. This gave people with custom ASICs and the capital a mining advantage. 
I like how LiteCoin did everything exactly the same as BitCoin, but changed it use scrypt as the proof of work. Scrypt was designed to stymie parallelization or custom hardware. It's a shame the original BitCoin didn't choose an algorithm that's hard to implement in hardware, or didn't switch to scrypt as soon as possible. Everyone world be on a much more even footing. But BitCoin didn't, and now we're stuck with it.
 I don't like the idea of fragmenting the crypto currency ecosystem - everyone printing their own money - we need one to take off. While other currencies might solve some problems, and I only know the details of LiteCoin, people should stick with BitCoin. But it doesn't mean you can't move forward with BitCoin
- have the lite clients that Satoshi talked about - prune off transactions going back to the genesis block so you don't need the entire irrelevant history on clients
- raise the artificial block size cap again (used to be 256kb, now is 1024kb). Make it like the difficulty - automatically goes up with average block size. Nobody got ddosd when it was raised from 256kB, but there wasn't 53% with huge hardware interested in it.
Ideally the block chain would fork into using scrypt - rendering my ASICs useless. But it's a better way to go. But if people can't agree on a minor configuration change without people crying 


Then there's no hope of any real changes.

[Neither]( You're thinking of [Bear Stearns]( as well as Fannie and Freddie.
After bailing out three banks, the government was sick of it - and let Lehman Brothers fail. That was a ***huge*** mistake - which after caused the economy to almost die after 3 days.
In the April of 2008, the Fed bailed out Bear Sterns, and then in the summer dealt with Fanny and Freddie. In September, Lehman and Meryll were in trouble. The Federal Reserve was sick of bailing out banks and they wanted to send a message: no more bailouts - no more money. 
Day 0 - Sunday, September 14th
On **Sunday** September 14th 2008 it was announced:
- Bank of America had agreed to absorb Meryll Lynch and all it's debt
- but also that Lehman Brothers was being allowed to die
Day 1 - Monday, September 15th
Panic. Lehman Brothers was allowed to die. If Meryll and Lehman could fail, who else might fail?
 Nobody knew who was next. Everybody was afraid to lend anything to anyone. Banks were no longer lending to other banks. The stock market crashed
Day 2 - Tuesday, September 16th
With the credit markets frozen, the insurance company AIG burned through it's savings and was about to become insolvent. The government bought up 90% of AIG, infusing them with $89B.
Day 3 - Wednesday, September 17th
The stock market crashed again - more. Credit was harder and harder to come by. Nobody was lending money.
Day 4 - Thursday, September 18th
Commerce is grinding to a halt. Everyone wanted their money out of the money markets. The Fed tried to infuse the money markets with $105B so people could continue to operate. The economy was in meltdown. 
We're no longer talking about mortgages, and big banks who had toxic assets. We're talking about every bank, that does anything, with anyone. **Nobody** could get a short-term loan.
- The safest, most rock solid banks could not borrow money. 
- You couldn't get a car loan.
- Small businesses couldn't get a loan to buy a new oven
- Corporations would not have been able to make **payroll**
Nobody expected that allowing Lehman to go into bankruptcy would cause a complete meltdown, but it did. And if it wasn't halted, the entire financial system of the United System would melt down in a matter of days.
Day 5 - Friday, September 19th
Hank Paulson needed to stop the meltdown. He needed to restore people's confidence **right the fuck now**. He wrote up a one-page memo, and went to Congress, saying he needs $700 **billion** in cash, and to have it approved before open-of-business Monday.
Without it: nobody would be able to get a paycheck next week.
Without bailing out the banks: the economy dies.

The system is tuned so that (on average) a *"block"* of transactions is generated every 10 minutes.
- the size of a block of transactions is limited to being `1,000,000 bytes`
- It takes (on average) `627 bytes` to store a transaction
That means that BitCoin is limited (on average) to:
- 1,000,000 / 627 = `1,596 transactions per block`
And since a block is generated (on average) every `10 minutes`, it means that BitCoin is limited to:
- `229,834 transactions/day`
The size of blocks started small; but [since 2009 has hit the limit](
- 
Limiting the[ transaction volume that BTC can deliver:](
- 
That is with today's limit of 1MB per block. The maximum size of a block has changed over time (e.g. [256 KB in 2013]( It was the intention of the original designer of the protocol that the maximum block size be periodically be increased. Hell, [*originally* it was 32MB:](
    MAX_SIZE = 0x02000000; 
It was time for *yet another* block size increase; this time to **2 MB** - hence the name: 


But there was much opposition to increasing the block size to 2MB. People who have set up huge BitCoin mining farms don't want twice the data flowing [over their slow, government firewalled, Internet]( 
So a compromise was created:
- we'll make the transactions slightly smaller (sacrificing some minor security detail) 
- and in exchange we'll increase the limit to 2MB anyway
It's a **take your medicine** type of situation.
- people opposed to raising the block size limit get to be happy
- while we raise the block size limit

In order for Bitcoin transactions to *complete*, it requires people donate computational resources on their own computers.
The incentive for this, as well as the mechanism whereby Bitcoins initially come into existence, is that every ten minutes (on average) ~~50~~ ~~25~~ 12.5 BTC are given out to winner of that block.
But the BitCoin algorithm also dictates that new BitCoins will not be created forever. Every four years the number of BitCoins awarded for solving a block is cut in half. (It's actually every 210,000 blocks - and the algorithm is designed such that each block takes 10 minutes to solve)
In this way, it is expected that by the year 2141 the reward for solving a block will go to zero:
- Initially: 50 BTC per block
- 11/28/2012: 25 BTC per block
- 7/9/2016: 12.5 BTC per block
- ...
- 2141: 0 BTC per block
This means that no new BitCoins will come into existence after the 2141. The supply of BitCoins will then be finite (with BitCoins being lost as people lose their wallets, or forget their passwords).
The incentive to participate in solving blocks will continue to exist - as the person who solves a block of transactions gets to collect all the transaction fees from those transactions.

i really should. i have a bank account of money, but nobody to share my life with. Being 40, and single, and never having had a girlfriend, means i don't want to do anything.
So, for fun, i bought 1 BTC at the $300 peak, the day before the big crash.

- i don't want to tell it at $1,000, because it might go to $10,000

The deflation is the issue. The rich man can hoard his cash, then causing deflation. Products are then even cheaper for him, while my wages also deflate.
And now his reserves can buy even more, and he can acquire more coin wealth, by being the entity with the reserves. Gaining more power.
The beta, and early, UO experimented with a closed economy. People began to hoard gold. Some got extraordinarily rich, which let them own more of the economy. Eventually there was little gold left for anyone else. And these wealthy few controlled more and more. Everyone else was starved out that they had to redesign an economy, where they constantly printed gold, and constantly destroyed gold, so that hoarders couldn't control the entire economy.

Given one person with 20,999,999 BTC, and everyone else left to divide 1 BTC.
That one person could destroy any business, or person, of his choosing.
With less than one ten-thousandth of a percent of his savings, he could control any market he chose.
He could buy every car, and force people to buy them from him. He could buy all milk, medicine, clothing, internet service, gold, and dictate the supply.
Unless, of course, we impose restrictions on a rich person's ability to own all factories, businesses, banks, stores, service providers, farms.
And then he is the single person to which anyone has to come to if they want a loan. Anyone who wants to buy, or build, anything has to come to him.
i assume such problems would never happen in reality, but BTC will never become popular enough to actually accomplish such things with. You'll never be able to buy a car, or a factory, or a city, with BTC. And if you could, the people with those BTC would be forced to pay income and death taxes in order to redistribute wealth.
But in an unregulated economy such problems exist.

Bitcoin *cannot* replace the world's currency.
The difficulty is adjusted so that it takes 10 minutes to solve a block of transactions. The number of transactions in a block is limited based on the size of the generated block. Let's assume a high figure of 1,000 transactions per block.
    (1000 transactions/block) / (10 minutes/block)
    = 100 transactions/minute
    = 144,000 transactions/day
That's a current limit imposed by the BitCoin protocol itself.

The issues created by a fixed monetary system are not an abstract set of rules that were designed by "elite and privileged intellectuals". 
The pressure to *not* spend my own BTC causes real problems for an economy (i'm certainly not going to let go of my 1.4437 BTC). If BTC is all there was, i would spend as little as i could get away with: electricity, internet, natural gas, water, gasoline, insurance, food. i would cut back on everything else, because the *instant* i spend money: i lose money. 
This means that everyone else gets less money
- the hairdresser has to 66% pay-cut, as i'll only get my hair cut every 3 months, rather than every month
- Newegg will lose 12% revenue, as i won't be buying that new hard-drive this year
- Wendy's won't be getting a visit from me twice a week for my spicy chicken sandwich plain and diet coke. Maybe once ever 3 weeks
- the grocery, and corner store, will get less money from me: i'll hold back on the steaks, and Peanut M&amp;Ms
And all these cuts cause all the employees of these places to receive less money; probably let some people go. With more unemployed people, they'll no longer frequent the places that my employer works for. That means there will be less work coming to my employer. Maybe i won't get a raise this year. So now i have even less BTC (since in this fantastical world i am paid in BTC).
So i have to cut even more. Feedback continues.
i'm not cutting my spending because Krugman said i have to; i'm cutting my spending because it's in my nature. And i don't **care** that i'm only hurting myself by spending less. 
That's when you have someone who will intentionally try to stop this death cycle. Perhaps they will dump BTC onto the market: stopping the deflation, making me realize it's ok to spend now. Perhaps they loan, or give BTC to people, encouraging them to spend BTC.
The point is: these are not actions **dictated** by *elite and privileged*. These are things that we will do, and economists know it ahead of time.

A bitcoin client is not required to have the *entire* block chain.
From Satoshi Nakamoto's [original paper](






transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree, with only the root included in the block's hash.  Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.




generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in

**Edit:** Figured it out. GUIMiner doesn't support mining using a CPU or nVidia CUDA; only OpenCL (e.g. ATI). That's why it "has nothing to mine on", it has no OpenCL video card it can mine on - so it quits.

In general, a hash is designed to be a fast, one-way function. And while the concept of a one-way function is great for password protection, the "fast" part isn't. It is preferred that the salt+password be hashed a few *thousand* times.
In fact, it is best if (when storing passwords) you don't use a *general* hashing algorithm (like SHA2), but instead use an algorithm designed with passwords in mind:
- PBKDF
- BCrypt
- SCrypt
But the strength of the BitCoin mining algorithm doesn't come from the speed of hashing, but from the imposed, and constantly adjusting, difficulty.
A miner has to try 4 billion ways to hash some transactions (4,294,967,296 to be precise). If they they get no solution, then they have to try the transactions in some other order, or with a new timestamp, or a new comment in the special "coinbase transaction" and try another 4 billion times.
And if they manage to get the answer too quickly, then everyone else will just increase the difficulty.

The recipe calls for 3 centiliters of vanilla. Then bake at 232 centigrade in a 23 centimeter cake pan.
So i'll add my two tablespoons of vanilla, pour it into the 9" cake pans, then set the oven to 450.

You can spend BTC enjoying a dinner and a show.
You can spend BTC enjoying gambling.
After both you end up poorer. As long as you enjoyed yourself: that's all that matters.

That's not what i'm talking about. i'm talking about the guy who lost 5 BTC.
If i go to a strip club on a Saturday night and drop $500, it's no more or less a valid form of entertainment as if i went to a casino and pulled a slot handle 500 times.

Levi Straus didn't become rich, during the gold rush, by mining gold.
Selling supplies to miners is the real money.

Buying bit coins is never a bad idea. They are a technological revolution that will change the world.
That, and the fact that I have no good or service that anyone would want to pay me BTC for.

i only have 0.7 BTC now.
And i have no way to mine any further appreciable amount.

I'd lose money:
- 3% fee on the buy transaction
- 3% fee on the sell transaction
- $3 inter-bank transfer fee

I bought at $197, after watching it from $50.
Nobody told me to though.

The whole

It's not. i'm not arguing that prostitution is wrong. Or being being forced to be prostitutes is wrong.
i was just pointing out that sometimes being forced into prostitution is ok, when the force is the kind of force that is ok.

Wait. If I have 20 BTC, and give someone 0.5 BTC, I actually lose 20 BTC?

There are a finite amount of physical resources, which can all easily be purchased. Then he can turn around and sell the product for "as many bit coins as you have"
I shall buy every dairy farm, and every cow on the planet. 1 BTC outta do it. Now I will charge 1 BTC for a glass of milk. What's that? You don't have that much? That's OK, I'll take your 0.00000000000001 BTC.
I now own every automobile factory. You want to buy a car you buy it from me.
I've purchased every patent related to smartphones. Anyone who wants to buy a phone buys it from my company.
Nobody is allowed to own ASICs, or video cards anymore. You see, I just bought nvidia and AMD, and they no longer make video cards.
I'm tired of having to pay other companies for barrels to ship my oil in. I'm going to buy that barrel making company - and all barrel making companies - and they of course will not sell barrels to my competitors.
