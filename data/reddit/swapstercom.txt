If you try to send to a bad address it will almost certainly fail and tell you the address is invalid.
Now -- losing passwords and such is a different story.

How do you find out who to buy and sell from with Dwolla? Are these friends, or is there a site that connects you?

In a few weeks... Swapster.com will launch. It will be instant - but only if you have Dwolla.
There WAS... eCardOne. It was a debit card. You send Bitcoin to the service and you get cash for use on the debit card. I think that was Liberty Reserve. The eCardOne.com has the funny "This Domain Has Been Seized" image. Ugh.

Ditto.... I have used it for almost a month... and CampBX will not let me withdraw my bitcoin until my Dwolla deposit has aged for 31 days (which sort of defeats the purpose of instant payments).

Swapster.com will provide the service in a few weeks. It is Dwolla centric - so you need a Dwolla account to pay and be paid.

Dwolla is an online service that lets you make or take instant payments from other people. You open a Dwolla account, fund it with money from your bank - and once you have it in Dwolla you can send it any where instantly. You can send it to friends, email addresses, businesses, etc. The nice part... instant payment and max fee of $0.25 regardless of how much you send.

That's... just, like your opinion, man!

Opportunity. Huge.
Worst thing about Bitcoin... Wallets are scary.

Sounds like a money pit with no bottom. Come on... I don't agree with the laws, but the laws were in place, and breaking said laws was the risk the guy took.

All mined bitcoin on the paid for machines belongs to the owner of the machines. The benefit goes to the owner and no one else. It is stealing.

I signed up... asking for a lot of sensitive information with no detail about who you are. I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole.

lol.... good one.
