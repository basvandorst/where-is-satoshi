The stairs seem to go sideways lately...

For those of us believing cryptocurrency is just a financial instrument and not thinking "*they are out to get us*", nothing really happened.
But hey, maybe I am just saying this because.... *dun dun dunnnnn*

Bitcoin isn't all that wanted anymore is my biggest hunch. More and more new investors start with the alt coins like ripple and so on. Less demand=lower price.

All I am saying is that it is not just "noobs panicking". It is also investors minimizing loss or taking profit. 
And yes the wording "noobs" and underlying message is not only cocky but IMO also wrong.
People posting here with either the religious message or the condescending message: get off your fucking high horse and start talking *sense*.
Edit: tiepo
Edit 2: nobody actually got worse off by taking profit in my book.

Rule  never long term invest with money you need on short notice.
Zero fucks are given.

Yes, let's call him a newbie because he is telling something I don't want to hear. Have you ever heard a stock investor say "hodl"? No? Ever asked why?

People here seem religiously entangled with their precious bitcoin. Language like "hodl", talking about "they" and shaming other crypto's is not safeguarding your investments. Talking other people into holding on until the bitter end is *not* sane advice.
Any investor knows when to cut down on their investments, maybe to get onboard later in time again, earning by riding the waves as suggested by is sane advice.
People talking about "noobs panicking", suggesting they know what will happen are the worst IMO. They will end up with nothing.

Excuse me for saying this, but this religious adoration of anything bitcoin is starting to become a bit ridiculous.
*Nobody* knows what will happen with a financial instrument as new as bitcoin. Additionally, on a technical level, computers will have advanced so much in the next 20 years, the current mining and block chain security will seem like a joke.
Sure, I hope my investments will perform nicely, but to assume everything will happen by itself is simply ridiculous. 
The blockchain will *have to innovate* to overcome the problems we encounter currently with high fees and slow confirmations. 
This is a prerequisite for having the bitcoin evolve further. And nobody can foresee if these prerequisites are going to be met in a timely fashion.
Let the downvoting begin... ��

I wouldn't go as far as calling the drops "attacks". Wether one likes it or not, the bitcoin in a financial instrument, attracting a multitude al different people. Price fluctuations belong with financial instruments like this.  If you do the math, nobody can just hop on board and get filthy rich without people bleeding for that. Where one gets rich, another man gets broke, simple as that. The value needs to come from somewhere.
Sounds familiar? Here in EU we call that pyramid games or heck... maybe even banks :-)
