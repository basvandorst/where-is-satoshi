Why not quote the whole sentence? Because they're making a killing with the fees.
If my small startup made just under a million $ revenue per month why would I risk everything for a potential heist to get away with a couple million.
That's like having a steady high salaried full time job and stealing the equivalent of a yearly income when you know you'll be caught and fired.

All valid points... I just wanted to point out that they sound more like capitalists than criminals to me.
Not saying you can't be both... =D

The article said $700-$900k revenue in fees per month in mid-2014.

No, I think that Pantera Capital wouldn't invest in an entity that doesn't have securities and a disaster recovery plan. Maybe I'm wrong and Dan Morehead doesn't know what he's doing.

They got for example $10 million from Pantera Capital. I'm not saying they can use that money to cover the losses, but I'm sure there are plans in place for disaster recovery. The hedge fund has the highest interest in saving Bitstamp to preserve their investment and has the financial power to back it.

You're right, that money will have been spent and/or planned for other things. But there's now a hedge fund with a lot more money and a vested interested to at least make their $10 million back.

I'd say it's highly unlikely that the price stays exactly the same but up or down are good guesses. Don't forget that it could also go up/down by a lot or not much.

The flaw in that logic is that to recover the potential loss through fees, Bitstamp would have to see the same volume in the future. I think it's more likely that a good number of customers will transfer their BTC elsewhere to do business. Also the blog implies that 100% of fee revenue is profit, which is wrong since they'll have some expenses.
