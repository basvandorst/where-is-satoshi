Buying bitcoin is more helpful to future success of bitcoin than investing in bitcoin-based businesses.  You don't need to worry about the businesses -- any time there is a profitable investment out there, every single profit seeking individual has the incentive to capitalize on it.
We create these investment opportunities by buying and supporting bitcoin.  If there are a ton of people out there with bitcoins, the businessmen will come.  They will cater.  We create the opportunity for profit... and then the profit motive will take over from there.  It's simple as that.
So, I saw you said in response below:


Don't be fooled!  You are directly supporting bitcoin!  Buying and promoting bitcoins is literally the most direct, productive support you can give to them.  It's entirely unnecessary to expect you to be involved on the supply side in the bitcoin economy.  As long as there is a demand side, the suppliers will come.
I mean, these arguments are so ridiculous on their face.  Which is more likely to grow the currency?  Are consumers more likely to *adopt* bitcoin, just because your business accepts it?  No.  Are businesses more likely to *accept* bitcoin, so that they can sell more products to those who have Bitcoins?  Yes.

Exactly.  Active trading is worthless.  It's gambling.  Active mutual funds don't outperform passive mutual funds - and they actually do worse with transaction costs.  It's one of the great anomalies of human irrationality in the Finance / Accounting research areas.  Why do people actively trade, despite it being demonstrably unprofitable?

@_date: 2014-04-25 13:52:16
Haha, that is actually an extraordinarily pervasive source of market inefficiency.  It is a fundamental human characteristic of our psychology: heads I win, tails it's luck. 
This psychological bias in humans leads us to be more *overconfident* over time.  This overconfidence can be observed throughout the market: hedge-fund managers, CEOs, your neighbor.... human beings on average all become less rational as time goes on, precisely due to the effect you just recognized.  We attribute success to our own efforts, and failure to luck.  Over time, our ability to make unbiased assessments, estimates, and predictions gets worse.  We overestimate returns on our investments, we underestimate our risk... 
So, congratulations on identifying a behavioral bias in this random bitcoin supporter that is actually present in every single human being?
Oh, and the funny thing is, the reasoning he used to make his prediction -- his "intuition" -- is no less valid than anyone else's reason for buying or selling!  It's all a friggin gamble!  This is a stochastic process!  So why criticize him for having an intuition?  He had a reason for buying back then, and it looks like a profitable decision.

Unless I misunderstood what you were saying.
I'm not talking about the currency market itself.  On the exchange market, you have bitcoins, so you are a potential supplier of bitcoins in that market.  (Although, merely having bitcoins does not make you a supplier in the currency market.  You could still want more bitcoins, placing you firmly on the demand side).
I was referring to a sustainable, functioning bitcoin economy.  Goods and services being exchanged with bitcoins as the primary medium of exchange.  We need consumers ready to buy goods and services with their bitcoins, and we need businesses ready to supply goods and services in exchange for bitcoins.  
In this market, bitcoin is merely the medium of exchange.  You aren't "supplying" bitcoin to the businesses.  The businesses are supplying you with goods and services, and you give them bitcoins in exchange.  Ultimately, goods and services are what the economy is about: bitcoins are merely the medium for exchanging those.  You are on the demand side - you demand goods and services - while the businesses that make things to sell to you are on the supply side.  (The inverse of this is the labor market: companies have a demand for employees to make their products, and individuals are the supply of labor.  In this case you would be the supplier.)
With this understanding of demand and supply, it is easy to see why demand will always create supply, and not the other way around.  Think of it: when you're on the demand side, it means you have MONEY that you're looking to trade for goods or services.  Businesses want your money.  They'll make whatever it is you want in order to trade for your money.  Everyone wants money.  But goods and services are subject to the tastes and purchasing power of those with money who would trade for them.  If all the consumers want tablet computers, companies are gonna make tablet computers.  Consumers don't want typewriters anymore?  Companies stop making typewriters.  Wherever money flows, is where investment flows.  Pinkberry discovered that Americans really enjoy frozen yogurt with various toppings.  Now, every goddamn street corner has a pinkberry or knockoff: yogurtland (the best lol), Menchie's, Red Mango, Snowberry.... oh man I've seen like 4 or 5 different other ones too but I can't remember their names.
But yeah, demand dictates EVERYTHING, because suppliers want to exchange their goods for cash.  They want the consumers to choose THEM to trade with.  It creates incentive.  It's the same reason why police cracking down on drug suppliers is pointless as long as demand exists.  You take down a drug kingpin, toss him in jail, and suddenly there's a job opening to be the one supplying the multimillion dollar demand for drugs.  
So as long as we have a strong demand to buy goods with bitcoins, suppliers will come.  Infrastructure will come.  Don't worry.

Come on, we need more productive discussion here.  This post contributes nothing.  You assert that the fundamentals are not ROCK SOLID without giving any support to that claim whatsoever.  
You then claim to know that he is making a "sub-optimal" financial decision, even though you don't have NEARLY enough data to make that assertion.  You don't even know how old he is (major contributing factor for risk-tolerance).  You don't know his wealth, his income, his other investments...
Why can't we just stick to discussing bitcoin?  And the FUNDAMENTALS of bitcoin?   Rather than making completely baseless and pointless assertions about others' financial strategies?

Nah, the infrastructure will come into place to make it really easy for them... just like everything else.  Old people have money, and society wants to get at that money, so we'll help em out.  We'll come up with some sort of simple bridge to connect them to the future.

It's an irrational belief that is widespread throughout the population.  Are you making a semantic statement?  Is it not a fallacy?  per wiki:


Well, the arbitrary distinction between "your money" and "house money" certainly qualifies as poor reasoning, given that they are the same in any real aspects.  To treat them differently is irrational, and thus poor reasoning.
And the vast majority of people are simply... wrong.  They are suffering from innate psychological biases that push them towards irrationality.

Bullshit.  Ecosystems depend on all members.  A successful bitcoin economy will need 
A) people with bitcoins looking to buy
B) people with other shit looking to sell for bitcoins
C) other technical infrastructure to keep everything moving along, like miners and bitcoin ATMs and the like
To pretend that people with bitcoins are less valuable than the rest of the components of this economy is erroneous.  In fact, "speculating" may be the most valuable investment in bitcoin.  Because you know what?  Anytime you try to create a new system like this, you run into the "chicken and the egg" problem.  Same thing with electric cars.
"I won't buy an electric car because there are no recharge stations!"
"We're not going to install a recharge station here because no one has electric cars"
You know how you can get over this problem?  You can either try to grow both sides, slowly, building outwards... you know, like Tesla making their super electric highway in California or whatever they mentioned...
OR: You can have a whole group of people who were like "FUCK IT, WE'LL GO FIRST."  That's what speculators did.  The bitcoin shops, the bitcoin infrastructure, NONE of it would have been possible without the "speculators" acting first.  
Thought experiment: Right now, electric cars are reeeeally impractical, especially depending on where you live.  In some areas, they are completely unusable.  Yet, if everyone in America went out and "speculatively" bought an electric car... don't you think we would almost instantly have an electric car infrastructure boom?  Of course motherfuckers are gonna build electric charging stations now!!!  The entire industry would blossom instantly, and those "speculative", previously USELESS purchases, would then be extraordinarily useful and usher in a new era.

Sounds like everyone has confirmation bias.  That's how these biases work.  Everyone has them.  They are innate and unnoticed.  That's why genuine, impartial scientists still use double-blind experiments - they don't even trust themselves to not influence the results... despite the fact that they are AWARE of the bias and they could conceivably compensate for it internally.  
But nope: even rational, genuine scientists, who are aware of confirmation bias and seek to eliminate it.... even they know that the only way they can avoid it is if they make themselves ignorant until the data has been collected.  
So, yeah, pointing out something that every human is subject to in everything no matter what... not super useful.
And the main thing that renders your comment completely useless is the fact that, in predictions about the future prospects of bitcoin, NO ONE HAS ANY CLAIM TO TRUTH IN THEIR PREDICTIONS!!  That's the kicker!  We can lay out plausible stories, we can have facts to support certain arguments, but we're dealing with a stochastic event.  We can evaluate arguments, we can consider conjectures, we can create beliefs about possibilities... but we can't ever claim to know who is correct.  Even after the fact!  Even the most compelling predictions, that end up coming true, are the result of stochastic processes.
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:45:30
No.  All that counts is having a functioning bitcoin economy.  You need consumers, producers, and infrastructure.  You need a big cycle: bitcoins move from consumers, to producers, to consumers, to producers, etc. etc., all using the bitcoin payment infrastructure.  
Now, go back to the moment before bitcoin was created and none of this existed.  How do you get it started?  We need all those components.  We need the producers and consumers to get the cycle going, and the infrastructure to move the money around.  Which comes first?  It's really tough to get started, because you need all those components in order for it to be successful!  And in the absence of even ONE component, it will not be successful.  It's a tough situation.  It's sorta similar to the anti-evolutionist arguments about how the eye has "irreducible complexity" - each part of the eye is worthless without the entirety of it, so how could it just evolve step by step?  
No one is going to seriously invest in payment infrastructure, if consumers don't have bitcoins and businesses don't take bitcoins.  So we can definitely rule that out.  Satoshi got us started off somewhat, by creating the bitcoin themselves, but we'll need a lot more infrastructure - ATMs, banks, phone apps, all the shit we take for granted in the US Dollar economy.  
(As annoying as bitcoins can be to send, store, etc. sometimes.... imagine how much more annoying it is for PHYSICAL DOLLARS to be exchanged in the same way?  Our infrastructure for the US Dollar has basically involved removing it from the process entirely because it's so annoying to deal with.  Bitcoins are already digital, imagine how spectacular they could be with supporting infrastructure - software and hardware)
So, are the producers going to be the first ones to start accepting bitcoin?  Obviously not.  They are trying to exchange their goods, for money!  If no customers have bitcoin to use as money, they would not ever start taking it.  Go ask Amazon why they don't take a currency you just made up.
So, the only solution: CONSUMERS MUST BE THE FIRST TO ADOPT BITCOIN.  Clearly.  There is no other solution.  And of course, the coins start out valueless.  If they eventually become widespread, they will be valuable!  Thus, speculation buying!  And ideological buying!  And all sorts of buying!  But notice here: starting with CONSUMER SPECULATIVE purchases is inevitable.  To use it as a criticism of bitcoin is an analytical failure.  
So yes, seeing as how the CONSUMERS in our economy must go first, seeing as how there are no PRODUCERS taking bitcoin yet, and no serious bitcoin payment infrastructure or understanding in place....  of course consumers can only buy bitcoins!  They can't spend them!  Obviously!  The logical reasoning makes it inevitable.  And the fact that it is inevitable means it gives us no information about whether bitcoin will be successful or not...
So, if consumers keeps buying Bitcoins, keep driving attention, keep driving more speculative purchases, etc.... then the Producers will slowly start to accept Bitcoin!  And the infrastructure will slowly be developed!  And then, actually PURCHASING things with your Bitcoins can be super easy like the US Dollar is now.
(Actually, Bitcoins could make us realize how inconvenient physical dollars are in ways we never appreciated.  We kind of get stuck in this mentality where the US Dollar, and paper cash in general, assumes "default" status, as if it were one of the laws of nature.  This makes us truly oblivious to the drawbacks and annoyances of the US Dollar for the same reason we don't actively lament the fact that we cannot fly.  The laws of gravity prevents it, and there is no criticizing that which is literally unchangeable.  I can think of so many ways, just in an infrastructure and transaction friction sense, in which Bitcoins are so much more convenient than US Dollars or physical money.  And yet, I am SURE there are going to be ten million more ways that I can't think of yet... once we no longer need physical money, we will better realize its limitations)
So, the observations about Bitcoin's trajectory thus far:
A) So many of the things people complain about are inevitable and temporary.
B) Given that these criticisms or "drawbacks" of Bitcoin are inevitable, they give us no additional information as to whether Bitcoin will ultimately be widely adopted or not.
One thing I would like to make extraordinarily clear is that without the speculation of the early adopters, Bitcoin would never succeed.  They were the ones willing to buy Bitcoins, and hold Bitcoins, and promote Bitcoins, and mine Bitcoins.... all for something that is essentially USELESS unless they can get a functioning market.  They were paying the price and taking the risk to try to create a functioning market and functioning currency.  They are the foundation upon which everything is slowly being built right now.
And there's another point I'd like to make clear, because it's extremely relevant in many areas of society: **Investments Follow Investment Opportunities**.  Not the other way around.  A million dollar idea isn't an idea you spent a million dollars to come up with.... it's an idea that was so good, it made you a million dollars.  Whenever there is an opportunity for profit, investments will flow in.  You know, this is the major flaw with "trickle down economics" and all that jazz about calling rich people "job creators."  Having a bunch of money doesn't create investment opportunities.  Investment opportunities attract and create money.  If you have no profitable investment opportunities, your capital is useless.  And if there are profitable investment opportunities, people will find the capital and make it happen.
This is how bitcoin works.  If we create a profitable investment opportunity, then we don't need to "invest in bitcoin businesses" as you say.  If anything, buying and holding bitcoins does much more to help the future prospects of bitcoin than "investing in a bitcoin business."  Buying and holding the bitcoins is risky and speculative!  It's not a sure-fire investment opportunity for a commercial business.  But once we create that ecosystem, once we've built *enough* infrastructure, once there are *enough* people with bitcoins, once it becomes widespread *enough*, the money will flow into the bitcoin businesses so goddamn fast.  People don't turn down opportunities for profit.  We need to create the conditions to demonstrate an investment opportunity, and we can get any fucking business we want to cater to us.
Relevant example from my field: The IRS had a tax holiday for businesses in 2004, allowing them to repatriate their cash holdings tax free.  They were allowed to bring the cash back into the USA tax free under several conditions, one of which was that the money had to be used for hiring and investment, etc. - an attempt to stimulate the economy.  Well, apparently Congress, in their infinite wisdom, forgot how difficult it would be to restrict the use of a fungible asset - fungible meaning: "oh, yeah i know we brought back $1 billion from overseas accounts, and I know we spent $1 billion on on a crazy party for our executives with hookers and blow, but that wasn't the same $1 billion we took from overseas.  We spent the billion we brought back on hiring and capital investment, like you said.  We burned a different billion dollars on that crazy party."
Anyways, researchers in finance and accounting investigated the holiday and they had some interesting findings.  None of the extra money was *really* used on hiring or investment, as stipulated.  Nope: companies used the cash to repurchase their own shares or pay down long term debt.  And the study's authors remarked: having money to invest does not create opportunities for investment.  And any worthwhile opportunities for investment will be taken, regardless of whether businesses have cash laying around to fund it.  That's what finance is for.  You see an opportunity to make money, you either borrow the cash or issue equity and you go take advantage of that shit!!
It's the same simple incentive structures that can completely explain Bitcoin's path up until this point.  It can be completely explained by economics, incentive structures, and simple logical reasoning.  Bitcoin isn't suffering because ers are buying bitcoins instead of "investing in bitcoin businesses."  Profit opportunities will be exploited, we don't need to ensure that.  We just need to entice them - and a ton of people with a ton of bitcoins and a ton of interest will do just that.
@_date: 2014-04-25 14:28:30
Incorrect.  It wouldn't be "smart" to invest in infrastructure, if all the "dumb" people hadn't bought massive piles of bitcoin already.  The speculators created that incentive for investment in infrastructure.

That's not how businesses make decisions.
Despite your arrogant assertions, percentage of bitcoin sales is not the "only important stat."  
Businesses seek to maximize profit.  Thus, the only important stat is: what effect does this have on net income?  If the extra profits from using bitcoin outweigh the costs of doing so, then they will continue to do it.  
Note that this doesn't just refer to bitcoin sales, and this doesn't just refer to the current moment.  They get valuable free publicity from this decision.  And even if bitcoin sales aren't profitable now, they may decide it is worth the investment for potential long term gain.

Ha!  Except it's still all gambling.  A diversified portfolio eliminates idiosyncratic risk, but you still have systemic (market) risk.  You just reduce the variance on your gamble, but you're still basically gambling.  (At least, gambling on the direction of the stock's movement.)
Making financial decisions to maximize one's utility is a very complicated process.  You didn't really contribute any knowledge or understanding with your statement.  You make a whole bunch of unsupported assertions, not very helpful!!  Basically, your entire contribution is "a diversified portfolio eliminates idiosyncratic risk and I think that is the optimal thing for you to do."
And a diversified portfolio can still be really risky.  It just won't have idiosyncratic risk.  And there are definitely other reasons to have a non-diversified portfolio besides "liking to gamble."  (Which, by the way - risk preference is a value judgment.  And, in many situations, higher risk is financially smarter.)
This topic is way too complex for you to give a decree about whether someone should or should not invest their money in a particular allocation.  Seriously, so many variables to consider to find the "optimal" investment.  So, for you to just assert something as optimal or true with no support contributes nothing to anyone's understanding.  
Instead, if you'd like to offer specific insight or knowledge, try that instead.  Such as "a diversified portfolio eliminates idiosyncratic risk but does not eliminate systemic risk."  That's what really needs to be said.  Because again... in your follow up you said 
"Unless you like to gamble, portfolios should be diversified. That's really all that needs to be said."
Which is better, because instead of making broad judgments and assertions based on insufficient data (like in your first post), you stick to make a specific point.  Unfortunately, you forgot to actually.... include information or actually make a point!  
In the future, if you think someone is making the wrong decision, just offer them whatever information you have that makes you think it's a bad decision.  That's it.  You don't need to try to sway them or judge them or exert authority over them.  Just share your relevant information and carry on.  All you've done here is toss these unsupported assertions around and tell people they're making poor decisions, without even really one piece of actual knowledge.  Not even in your followup!

Anything is reasonable if you can reasonably support why it is the most desirable course of action.
However, be careful though.  The key word in that phrase is "if you think it will continue to decrease."  Selling is reasonable only so far as you can *reasonably* justify a future prediction of price decline.  And those kind of predictions are very speculative, at best.  You've entered gambling territory.  
That's why it's dangerous to say something is "very reasonable" given a certain set of beliefs.  It's ultimately only as reasonable as the justification for the beliefs.  And that's what amuses me the most about the "will it go up, will it go down?" drama on r/bitcoin.  Everyone pretends to be making these rational analyses with carefully considered decisions... but with how much certainty can anyone predict what will happen?  
Each side tells stories predicting the future of bitcoin, they have carefully selected evidence supporting their arguments... and yet, really, it's all fucking completely stochastic.  No one in their "analysis" could ever claim to have anything close to a comprehensive idea for the future of bitcoin.  And the possibilities are so vast, you could come up with millions of stories and facts and evidence to support whatever side you want.
Everyone should just make their own decision about buying and selling bitcoins, using all available data.  Statements like "Selling is very reasonable if you think it will continue to decrease" are literally entirely useless.  Selling can be reasonable even if you think bitcoin will increase, and selling can be unreasonable even if you think bitcoin will decrease.  And ultimately, is there really any objective value to whether someone thinks bitcoin will go up or down?  It is quite literally impossible to say with any sense of objective truth or theoretical/empirical support.  That second half of your sentence is completely arbitrary.
This is why r/bitcoin shouldn't get caught up in the financial planner aspects of bitcoin.  Let's focus on making bitcoin successful... and not discuss investment strategies.  Everything I've read on about investing is so laden with error, triviality, and arbitrariness that it kinda concerns me.

Uhh, maybe?  We'll have to wait and see on that one. Don't be disingenuous and try to switch gears...

There you go!  Now that's proper reasoning.  I pretty much agree with everything you said.
I don't care what the price is.  I can't foresee bitcoin *not* becoming the next big thing.  It is practically there already.
And regardless of the financial aspects, I will sure as hell do my part to help push it along.  I can't wait.

Exactly.  For any startup - whether it's a company, commodity, or even a new idea - shifts in market value (stock price for a company, or acceptance for an idea) are not indicators of fundamental value or future expectations.  We learn more about the market participants than we do about the new item.
If you are buy-hold in bitcoin, the price is completely irrelevant.  You know the concept of a non-scale victory in physical fitness?  Your weight is essentially irrelevant, except as a usually poor signal for other items of interest (attractiveness, fat content, health, etc).  Well, we in r/bitcoin need to focus on the non-scale victories.  I could give a fuck if bitcoin is at $2 or $1,000.  The determinants of its success are the real circumstances and events in the world.  
I don't check the daily price level.  I listen to the general attitude and the environment.  Every bitcoin ATM that goes up adds to the real value of my bitcoins.  Those are good predictors of future success.  Every time another company accepts bitcoin, every time some person whom I would have never expected brings up bitcoin, that's a real value gain.  I don't care if it goes up or down right now.  That doesn't predict bitcoin's success.  The current price is just a noisy signal that represents the weighted average of the beliefs of market participants about the value of bitcoin.

Uhh, not analogous.  The real analogy would be two middle class people working at the same job - where one used to be homeless but turned his life around, and one used to be wealthy but fell from the ranks.  They are in the exact same job now, make the same money, in the same boat.
Those who lost money... have already lost their money!  No longer relevant for rational people!  And those who made money... have also made their money!  No longer relevant!  One may have bought at $182, and one may have bought at $800, but Bitcoin is at $500 now.  They both have $500 bitcoins.  Same boat.  Their decision to buy or sell is essentially aligned.

Well, according to the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, basically all trading is gambling.  Markets already incorporate all available information into stock prices.  And if the price for the stock is correct, you're just gambling.  The past has no predictive power for future stock returns, in this sense.
We know that this hypothesis is flawed, and subject to multiple anomalies / timing issues / human behavioral biases.  But these anomalies cannot be exploited without large, diverse investments, and even then it's to limited financial gain.  The idiosyncratic risk of individual investments overrides all of these anomalies.  They can only be observed statistically on a large scale.
Any type of active trading is gambling.  Just invest passively, take the market, and minimize your gamble.  Create your investment portfolio to match your desired level of risk, and that's it.

This is irrelevant to his post.  He was posting about how bitcoin's fundamentals and outlook are strong.  He was giving people reason to have confidence that this currency will be successful.  He wasn't giving financial advice on portfolio allocations and diversification.  
Regardless of whether you think bitcoin will flop or be wildly successful, financial portfolio allocation is a completely separate issue.  It could make sense for someone who thinks bitcoin will flop to buy.  It could make sense for someone who thinks it will succeed to sell.  These are financing issues, which should take into account SO MANY unique personal variables and circumstances.  Income, wealth, risk, hedging, future personal plans, financial goals, risk preferences, etc.  These are components of financial planning.  
But portfolios and allocation is a completely separate issue, one in which advice cannot be given out on the basis of bitcoin alone.  We can discuss the currency and its fundamentals, its future prospects, even price expectations for the future.  But no one should ever be giving "buy or sell" advice, or diversification advice, etc.  To properly advise someone in this matter, you need much more information than just bitcoin price expectations


I was concerned with you giving financial advice before, and this passage grossly exacerbates my concerns.  As mentioned earlier, simple calculations show his average cost is $181.  No one who should be giving financial advice would have missed that.  
But what concerns me the most is the second part: **there is no such thing as playing with house money.**  You need to realize this.  He bought at $181 a coin.  His coins are currently worth $480.  He has already made his profit.  If bitcoins go down, he will have lost his own money.  Same goes for those who "bought at $1200" and who apparently "have every reason to be panicking right now."  
What reason do they have to be panicking, versus those who bought cheaper?  If you bought at $1200, you already lost that money.  Right now, the guy who bought at $181 and the guy who bought at $1200 are in the same boat.  They both have coins worth $480 dollars, and they're both hoping they go up.  They both have $480 at risk, of their OWN money.  One already gained value, and one already lost value, but their possesions are equal at this moment.  They both have the same at risk and the same to gain.
Here's an interesting example of this irrational "house's money" fallacy.  Do you know the show "Cash Cab"?  People answer trivia while getting a cab ride, winning money for right answers.  At the end of the ride he gives them a chance to go double or nothing on their winnings with one final question - they've usually won about a thousand dollars or so up to this point, risk free.  Now, many of the contestants end up taking the double or nothing final bonus question.  But they could have walked away with a thousand dollars - their income was already +$1,000.
So, let's say instead of you being lucky enough to get a ride in the cash cab, let's say your boss at work gives you a $1,000 bonus.  As you're walking home from work, the guy from Cash Cab approaches and says that he can't do any more cab rides, but he'll let you wager $1,000 dollars on a trivia question.
Purely financially / rationally, these situations are entirely equivalent.  You get a $1,000 income gain, and the opportunity to wager $1,000 on a trivia question.  Many people end up doing the bonus double or nothing question on Cash Cab.  But I bet not a single person would wager $1,000 of their "own" money on a trivia question - even if their total wealth was the same in either scenario.  Hugely irrational.


Uhh, you just said that people who bought at $1,200 have "every reason to be panicking right now" and now you say that bitcoiners have too much emotion?  I agree that letting emotion cloud rational judgment is not optimal, but you don't seem to be providing the appropriate advice to correct their course.  "Cutting your losses" is such a meaningless phrase in a true rational analysis.  Losses are in the past.  Rational decision-making is focused on the future.  We use data to form expectations about the future, and then we plan a course of action based on those expectations.  Thus, the past is only relevant in that it can provide data for making expectations about the future.  
Whether you have lost money already and are considering "cutting your losses" is the same as whether you've already made a bunch of money and are considering "cashing out."  Regardless of whether you've won or lost in the past, the rational objective is the same: assess your current situation, form expectations about the future, and determine your best course of action.  
Your financial advice is not useful because it assumes that everyone has the same values and circumstances as you.  One should evaluate their current income, their overall wealth, their future risks (both financial and otherwise), their beliefs about the future of the currency, their values, etc.  Even from a purely financial standpoint, circumstances can make all the difference.  A young person can afford to take on a lot of risk, so for them, having a 95% bitcoin portfolio might be advisable.  Those near retirement: I wouldn't recommend it.  You're also forgetting that people have different preferences for risk: some people are risk-lovers, and they would load up on bitcoin!
Although I would actually disagree with the fact that bitcoiners are "treating their holdings with way too much emotion."  This isn't buying corporate bonds or facebook stock or something.  You're not just buying rights to future cash flows and hoping the stock price goes up.  It's not even similar to risky financial securities.  We're not buying stock in a biotech and hoping their miracle drug passes FDA approval.   We're not trying to find the next "Apple" or "Starbucks" to get extraordinary returns on our investment.
Bitcoin has the potential to completely revolutionize human socioeconomic structures.  I'm a young guy, and bitcoin is my only investment.  I didn't just buy it because I think it will be successful (although I do) or because I thought it could potentially make all of us bitcoiners a LOT of money (again, another belief I hold). 
I bought bitcoin because I wanted to support it.  I wanted to make it successful.  I like what it can do for the world.  For once, I was able to make an investment in something that I truly support, from a philisophical, economic, social, and idealistic basis.  I was never so glad to invest all of my money in something as I was for bitcoin.  If it ends up making us all a ton of money, that would be really awesome.  But if it doesn't, I didn't lose on my investment.  I used my resources to try to further something I support on a personal and philisophical level.  I donate to support things I truly believe in.  I use my limited resources to try to shape the world in the direction I think is best.  Bitcoin is like an ideological donation that could end up paying dividends... big time.

Says who?  It is quite obvious that monetary policy can influence worldwide economies.  A bad economy can most certainly be a bad economy because of fiat currencies.  Fiat currencies enable all sorts of things - they allow excessive government spending with ease, and they allow governments to take money from citizens at will to pay off state debts.  Your claim that local currencies are more stable than BTC could ever be are unsupported and likely fallacious.  BTC is inherently more stable than fiat.  It's entirely predictable and not controllable - neither claim can be made by a fiat currency.  


So?  Those are unavoidable consequences.  Regardless of whether Bitcoin ends up being wildly successful or a massive failure, those are simply inevitable steps along that same path.  Any new currency will be extremely volatile and have low trading volumes.  Any new currency will not *instantly* have infrastructure in place to make all transactions as quick as the established currencies.  
What is your point here?  We learn nothing from these examples.  Success or fail, any new currency will go through that.


Bitcoin has remained what it was supposed to be.  Bitcoin hasn't changed at all.  You're attributing all these human reactions and interpretations to the coins themselves.  Bitcoin is the exact same as when it started... and it can fulfill the exact same purpose.












Do you not realize how your "analysis" provides no insight whatsoever?  Of course people spend those currencies!!  They are established!!  Is it surprising that Bitcoin is not used as widely as US Dollars right now?!  What argument are you making?  What insight do you provide for the future trends of these currencies?  What observations have you made here?
The circumstances you've described above are inevitable for a startup currency like Bitcoin - regardless of whether it will be a success or failure.
And you criticize the "speculators" for not using their bitcoins as a currency... but don't you see?  It is *precisely* those buy-hold speculators who are keeping bitcoin alive, and progressing it down the path to success!!
Obviously, a functioning bitcoin economy needs consumers with bitcoins, producers willing to take bitcoins, and infrastructure to process bitcoin transactions.
We need all three!!  And one is practically useless without the rest.  So who are the ones taking the stand to get things going?  Who are the ones taking the risk, and be the first to invest in the new currency?  THE "SPECULATORS"!!  These fantastic bastards are buying bitcoins, promoting them, and increasing their fundamental value and likelihood of success!!  I mean, fuck, look at how far Bitcoin has come the past couple years!  All because of those "speculators" you lambast.
Think of this: does the infrastructure come first?  Do the investors come first?  No.  The investment *opportunity* comes first.  Speculators create the investment opportunity by promoting and holding bitcoins.  The profit motive, that invisible hand of the market, will do the rest.  Investment follows opportunity, and the speculators, the early adopters of bitcoin, are creating that opportunity.  
And come on... "very few of you are using Bitcoin as a currency."  Once there are businesses accepting it, with convenient infrastructure, do you *seriously doubt* that any of these people won't be using it as a currency?  Of course they don't use it as a currency because IT'S FUCKING DIFFICULT AND ANNOYING TO TRY TO DO SO AT THE CURRENT MOMENT.  Right now we're stuck to like, novelty shit.  We can't just actually use it easily when we want to pay for shit.  We go out of our way to buy a pizza from that one pizza store that takes bitcoin.  We buy something on overstock instead of Amazon so we can pay bitcoin there.  I got reddit gold a couple years ago without realizing they took bitcoin, but as soon as I saw the option in checkout, you better believe I used my coins!
But fuck, man.  You've made a bunch of observations of things that are inevitable, regardless of bitcoin's eventual success or failure, and then you misinterpret them as indicators of Bitcoin's impending failure.  Seriously!  We gain NO NEW INFORMATION from the fact that bitcoin is volatile, or that there's not much infrastructure, etc.  It's like going to earth a few million years ago, seeing that none of the life was intelligent, and thus concluding that Earth could never have intelligent life.  You need un-intelligent life *before* you can get intelligent life!   Observing a prehistoric Earth with non-intelligent creatures gives us NO INFORMATION about whether Earth could eventually have intelligent life.... since that is a necessary prerequisite for both outcomes.
You pretend like you're being insightful, but you're being trivial at best, misleading at worst.  You're kind of just being a hater.

This article is RETARDED.  the currency is very volatile right now.  large shifts are to be expected.  This isn't inflation in "contrast to the deflationary trend."  
What a completely retarded, nonsense, waste of time article.

Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized.  You're missing the point entirely.
Who would make them worthless, without a centralized authority?

On what grounds can you say this?  What is your support for this statement?

~~Why not?  It is inevitable that any "Currency of the Future" would have extremely high volatility when trade volume is low.~~
~~If Bitcoin is widely adopted and used enough to generate high trading volumes, then the price will stabilize.~~
~~This is not something that is unique to Bitcoin.  This is basic economics.  And this will go away once this currency becomes the "Currency of the Future"!!~~
~~edit: added your initial post.  i'm trying to make that a thing I do now.~~
edit 2: It appears that I was not clear enough in my initial posting, due to the number of downvotes this comment has received.  Allow me to try again:


**Any new, emerging currency such as bitcoin will have extreme volatility.  This is inevitable.  This is not unique to bitcoin.**
Prices are determined by the markets (currency exchanges).  Supply and demand in that market create an equilibrium price.  With low trading volume, this equilibrium price is going to be extremely volatile.  Look at [this graph]( of trading volume over time.  At one point in November 2013, trading volume was $1.4 million.  In mid December, trading volume spikes to over $83 million!  Thus, speculation and manipulation have significantly more pronounced effects.  These effects can dominate the market!  (clearly).
Liquid markets are the key to a stabilized price point for any asset.  The current volatility is inevitable and not unique to Bitcoin.  And thus, your statement that the "currency of the future" wouldn't be one that loses 45% of its value in a few hours is both correct and incorrect.
You are correct in that a major, widely adopted currency should not lose 45% of its value in a few hours.
You are incorrect in saying that this is a reason why Bitcoin would never be the currency of the future.  You are incorrect in assuming that bitcoin would still have 45% value swings if it *did* become the currency of the future.
It is absolutely inevitable for an infant market to be volatile.  This 45% loss really tells us nothing about Bitcoin's long term prospects.

A central bank only serves to control the supply of a fiat currency.  Bitcoin has a fixed supply.  There would simply be no central bank for bitcoin.  It would not be possible to have a central bank for Bitcoin.  And Bitcoin cannot be manipulated in the way that central banks manipulate fiat currencies, seeing as how it is deregulated.

You have made several assertions for which I see no support.


Why must a currency be regulated?  Still no answer for this.


What point are you making here?  I assume by "real" you mean "fiat."  And yes, all fiat currencies are regulated by central banks.  That's kind of the definition, and major difference with bitcoin.  No regulation, no management.  Fixed amount of coins. (Eventually).
And just think of what kind of power that bestows on those central banks?  We are all forced to use US dollars as a medium of exchange here.  We earn our incomes in USD, we buy things in USD, we store our value in USD.  And yet, this central bank has complete control over those US dollars.  Were they to print massive quantities of money, as has been done in the past, they could literally steal your wealth at will.  
Look at what happened to Russia in the mid-90s.  Government needs to cover deficits, so they print a bunch of rubles.  With that act, they are essentially stealing wealth from anyone who has rubles, and transferring it to themselves.  Rubles had a 943% inflation rate in 1993, 337% inflation rate in 1994... all that wealth that people had in their rubles was rapidly reduced.
You should consider this when making your assessment as to whether central banks are desirable.  It's an incredible power to have.


You can't have a global currency going rampant without some sort of law that limits usage. It goes against its nature.
These... again... aren't really support for why a major currency must also be regulated.  They're just not.  You haven't really raised any facts or points.

It's not so much about whether these college kids are correctly predicting Bitcoin's future.  We're not banking on their correct analysis.
It's that constant exposure and discussion and relevance can only be a good thing.  Those will undoubtedly increase bitcoin's adoption.

Ahh, I see.  You seem to be a bit misinformed about monetary policy, but it's confusing stuff.
Hyperinflation is a product of fiat currencies, with central banks that control and increase the supply of money.  
There are a fixed amount of bitcoins.  There can be no hyperinflation.  No control over supply.
