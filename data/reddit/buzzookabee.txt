do you really believe that? the NFL is under a ton of fire for injuries to players, if the solution were as simple as "take off your pads" it would have been done by now.
this is also ignoring the fact that rugby and American football are completely different games. American footballers hit very hard with the goal of stopping the opposing player completely, where as in rugby there's more finesse involved so the hits aren't as brutal to the body.

This only changes the bash used by terminal sessions, this wouldn't change the shell used by Apache (for example)
As stated elsewhere, this vulnerability isn't a huge deal if you're not running services that are open to the internet at large. Changing your terminal shell, while a fun learning exercise, isn't going to help if you have Apache running cgi scripts that execute bash.

I'm sure they've already done market research on the name Gnome. they probably just don't want to jump straight into losing whatever money they spent on it without trying some attempt to keep the name.
hopefully with enough noise/donations they'll just move on to a different name.

changetip does all the actual tipping using off chain transactions, so no, Bitcoin isn't necessary at all for the service.
I could easily whip up a service that does the same thing strictly in USD that requires a credit card to "top up" your account.

oh I absolutely agree, I just wanted to point out that whenever a company does something weird money is usually involved.
as to why they didn't stop with the name when they found out it was a registered trademark? I'm guessing some exec took this on as his pet project and likes the name, but who the hell knows.

so i always start on the bitcoin blockchain, move to a sidechain, then possibly back to btc, but btc is always involved. thanks!

Correct, my point was that Aussiehash's steps above don't help in those scenarios, as the unpatched bash is still on your machine and is still going to be used by dhclient and others.

I really enjoy the fact that with micro tipping I don't really have to care about things like this, since it's such a small amount!

no what i’m saying is that you can’t consider bitcoin’s current implementation of digital scarcity to be a valid solution to the problem, because if people of any real scale were using the network, including the miners necessary to support them, we’d be using way too much energy. that shit doesn’t scale.
bitcoin already uses too much energy, but sure, i’m the one making no sense.
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:35:45
damn dude you need to read up on the tech you’re evangelizing
miners use energy to confirm transactions. without miners confirming transactions you have no network.
users rely on transaction confirmations to know they were either paid, or their payment was received.
the more users you have, the more miners you need to keep up with demand. no one will wait 40 minutes to pay for their coffee.
so in order for bitcoin to scale with growth, miner count needs to scale with that growth, thus energy needs grow as well.
@_date: 2019-01-13 17:29:05
it’s hardly solved digital scarcity considering the amount of energy it uses, especially considering it uses that amount at non-mainstream usage levels

The answers to  so far haven't been very good, so I'll make an attempt.
Mining doesn't affect the *value* of bitcoin, it is necessary to make bitcoins *valuable*. Bitcoin's blockchain is a string of transactions, where each transaction is verified to be valid (you're spending coins that belong to you, you haven't already spent them, etc). The miners take pending transactions, perform a computation with them, and that computation results in a value that is easy for others to verify as correct, but is really hard to actually compute. This value ties those transactions (grouped as a block) to the previous block of transactions when it's added to the blockchain.
Since this computation is expensive (time, power) it becomes hard for others to change what is already in the blockchain. The fact that others can't change it adds trust to the system; you can trust the fact that address XYZ has 4BTC actually has 4BTC.
TL;DR: without mining, it would be trivial for people to "duplicate" bitcoins and make them worthless.

why not just use bitinstant -&gt; bitcoin address? You could use bitaddress.org to create an address from tor that wouldn't be traceable to you

Transactions are stored in the blockchain, not in your wallet. Wallets only store the public address and private keys to said addresses.

unless I'm mistaken, 2fa is only offered on web wallets, so how would local software access your wallet after logging in? there is no .dat file that they can just steal.
They'd have to have software that has infected the browser, allowing it to execute in the context of your web wallet's session (cookies, etc). Not impossible, but I think it's easier said than done, given a modern browser.
edit: and even if we were talking about local .dat wallets with 2fa, they're still going to be encrypted on the disk, even after you enter your password. You'd need to be able to write malware that is capable of reading the decrypted wallet in memory, which even the earliest versions of windows would prevent.

do you have more info on this? i've been wondering what sort of options there are for bitcoin on point-of-sale systems and this sounds intriguing.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:04:03
any implementation of 2fa shouldn't be allowing reused codes, so I don't really think this is an issue. The only way it could really work is if you were MITMing them, took the code and prevented it from hitting the web wallet's service, then did your wallet sweeping shenanigans.

In the future this might be less of a problem, Satoshi outlined a way for bitcoin to support escrow functionality directly at the blockchain level:
tl;dr - the funds get transferred to the seller but are 'locked' until the buyer signs off. If the seller doesn't send the goods, the buyer can destroy the coins.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:57:10
aren't 2fa codes temporary and only used once? how would a keylogger swiping a *used* 2fa code help them?
@_date: 2013-01-05 00:58:10
a minor point: you said that the poker website didn't need any of your info, and while that's true, it's not actually *anonymous*. When you transferred that 1BTC to him, that transfer is now visible in the blockchain for **everyone** to see. That means everyone can see 1BTC going from your address to the poker site's address.
Anyone that wants to can do some forensics on the blockchain and see what else you've used that address for. A truly dedicated person could potentially link that address to you, and it's no longer anonymous.
This is why bitcoin is referred to as "pseudonymous" - the addresses themselves aren't something that directly tie to you, but indirectly they might.

Nothing can be done to a bitcoin account without the private key. If a gov't has ways of making you reveal the private key, then they can effectively take your account/coins. How a gov't could do this is limited only by your imagination. For example, torture would probably be a pretty effective way.
