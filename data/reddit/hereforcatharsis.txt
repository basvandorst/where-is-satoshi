And here is the butter conundrum.  
When the cost to transport your currency is valued higher than the actual  currency itself, its worthless.  
What is gold worth to me, personally?  Nothing.  Market caps and buying power are all that I care about.  You know what it takes to write a dollar transaction to a database?  Fucking nothing.  Buttcoin takes throwing random large primes across farms of servers to validate 1 transaction.  
You ever wonder what crypto would look like with a bunch of idiots trying crypto?  Bitcoin.  And thats why itll fail.  Its like claiming the square is a better wheel than a circle, as ling as we spin the wheel 1000% faster.  
Dont evem come at me with an economical perspective when you dont understand why the basics of your currency is retarded.

Bank fees.  Alright, i just transferred 2k from my savings to my checking account.  Didnt cost me anything.  What, costs me like 20$ a year to have a bank account.  Huge fees.  That single transaction is like what, 4$ on BTC?  For a single fucking transaction?  And a fee needs to be spent on every transaction?  We arent talking some bullshit "convienience fee" we are talking to literally use the platform.  Any sort of real life transaction fee is imposed by the seller, not the medium.  


You get that btc doesnt scale right?  Like at all.  Thats not how math works, unless you guys are banking on hardware to have a giant leap (like giant) in the next few years.  This is honestly something im ignorant of, but you habe to fix the underlying power issue for this even to be considered.


I never said that.  I said 1 BTC = 1 BTC.  1 house =1 house unless you can find a buyer.  
Its a bubble imo.  A really sexy bubble.  I think people making bank are fine.  I dont think the advocates are fine though, those people are retarded.  


Hell yea.  I coulda INVESTED in BTC years ago and I didnt.  Hell, I could invest now.  I could also become a Scentsy seller, but I recognize bubbles when I see them.  I hope you arent a holder and you actually come out on top fam.  The underlying tech is just fucking stupid to me.
