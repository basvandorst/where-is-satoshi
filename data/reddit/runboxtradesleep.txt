Invest your money in trying to get better. Take a trip to a third world country with good medical care. You can keep $40k, $20k or $5k of the BTC but it won't matter if you drop dead on your toilet.

Erm..get on a plane to Singapore..open a DBS account..with which u can open any exchange account...then go there on a budget flight once every six months to deposit cash into it..the tourist cash allowance is reasonable...could be more if u sell some gold jewellery or diamond everytime u come...

Wolf of Wall Street is abt a market manipulator in small stocks that eventually got sent to jail..
The crypto trading scene is full of outright pump and dump groups that advertise openly, founders who shill their coins on TV, huge allocations in ICOs to founding teams, hacks, dozens of hidden charges, Binance’s dust that forces you to buy their coins...number of ppl jailed: 0
I love the tech but as someone who works in regulated markets..it’s amazing more ppl haven’t gotten scammed in crypto..caveat emptor...

Guaranteed scam...hate this guy..

Lol this dude is an investment guru who lives in Ottawa...how’s the Lambo dealership there?....is tether a scam?..absolutely..is bitcoin going to drop 20% from here?...probably...does your “I told you sold” post actually transmit any information..fk no...please go back to chopping wood or whatever the fk it is you guys do in ur little town...

The post is really short so I'm shocked you didn't actually read it. I'm asking about regulation of the exchanges, not Bitcoin itself. It's like you saw the word "regulation" and typed a response. Try reading "Thinking, Fast and Slow".

Order books change constantly. Just saying.

You need to get out of the house more if you think owning crypto is a source of manhood.

Reddit is also unlikely to give you any credit for this insight. Average Redditor has $500 he is “HODLing to the moon” while people are trading $500k tickets. Reddit is a good place for tech news but it’s a barren wasteland for trading. Probably for the best given that crypto is more like venture capital and less like listed equities. Not sure there is any value in trading.

Assuming that:
A. They all bought over the same time, not over twenty years.
B. That the Chinese miners and Asian whale holders don’t have a level in mind where they are happy to sell and get out of the technology.
C. The new American buyers of Bitcoin actually held it instead of selling or using it.
I actually ran out of fks to give about a silly hypothetical question. If the citizens of a large country all bought one asset together at the same time it would go up, yes. All else being mysteriously held equal.

It was envisioned as a currency and is now transitioning to store of wealth to hide incompetence in the primary objective...this reminds me of early search engines that became portals when Google started kicking their butt...forget bitcoin and think abt who is functioning like the Google of crypto...

The comment chain literally proving the point of the original post..."use other coins then"..."no one cares about fees"..."decentralisation incurs a cost"...lol

Lol don’t be a donkey..the first thing people will do with their crypto millions is hit up a party like this...what do you think ppl want Lambos for?...Singapore Grand Prix? ��

Nicely done dude. Try to keep track of what you do well and do badly. That way you are developing a decision making process to help yourself in the future (vs gambling). Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:35:29
Nicely done.
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:41:59
Your last sentence is the clue to all of this noise. If the market breaks everytime there are big orders, then it will amplify the moves. There is a reason exchanges for other stuff are regulated.

I'm not the donkey who can't plan my taxes. Perhaps reflect on your pervasive arrogance and how it's landed you in this situation.

You are practically the definition of an idiot. Crypto currency trading is a sub culture within a subculture within a tiny tech savvy population of Asia. The people trading it are either v rich or v educated. Your assumption that it's Asian ppl and not automated bots out of Asia smacks of lazy stereotyping. Or you bought at 1.24 ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:23:20
You do not have enough liquidity to pay your taxes. That is the very definition of overstretched.  I'm not American so have nothing to add to the tax debate but you should really consider managing your counter party risk better. Every crypto exchange is at a material risk of getting hacked and you losing serious cash.

You will not get the credit you deserve for this insight..well said..
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:49:21
Huh?...he's talking abt the flaws in the "always HODL" model and you are coming back with short term speculator concerns. We are all bullish here man, but try to read the post atleast ��

Lol only Americans have mothers on crack bro...starting to think maybe you need a passport ...
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:03:02
You are very right. If we control our urges for pointless material shite life would be easier..

You didn't know to save before Bitcoin?
