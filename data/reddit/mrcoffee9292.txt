For perspective:
*2008*: In September 2008, Lehman Brothers collapsed as the financial crisis spread. For the year, S&amp;P 500 falls 38.49 percent, its worst yearly percentage loss.
*March 9, 2009*: S&amp;P 500 closes at 676.53, its closing low after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis and the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy.
A potential game changer: ryptocurrencies are seen as bringing innovation to the payments-services sector; furthering financial inclusion; and facilitating greater efficiency in cross-border transactions.  Beyond Bitcoin, the wider adoption of cryptocurrencies is still in its infancy 
**I think a lot is here to stay but two things stand out:**
1. Facilitating greater efficiency in cross-border transactions; with the efficiency of block chain contractual and confirmation reliability  
2. ICOs: Companies have another decision to make when it comes to raising money. According to a *Reuters* article published in February 2018, hundreds if not thousands of initial coin offerings (ICOs) who are seeking token buyers - entrepreneurship and a new medium for raising funds.

 The tropical fungus *Ophiocordyceps* infects ants’ central nervous systems. By the time the fungi been in the insect bodies for nine days, they **have complete control** over the host’s movements. They force the ants to climb trees, then convulse and fall into the cool, moist soil below, where fungi thrive. Once there, the fungus waits until exactly solar noon to force the ant to bite a leaf and kill it

I think the idea is open source crowd funding - collect enough assets from hype and marketing a daily dividend, and then part of the dividend comes from revenue received on loans

I think a little study  of basic history would prevent you from continuously running head first into brick walls. 
Pre 1913, minting / printing of currency was localized. Young JP Morgan and other modern day "big bad banks" decided how much liquidity would enter the system. There were 6 busts, 1907 mos intense, (and bailouts) mid 1880s to 1913. The governement tried minting money for a period - which was understandably a disaster. Finally the Fed, as we know it, came into existence following the 1929 depression.   
Controlling liquidity via 1) fed funds rate and 2) open market policy - they are able to raise or lower bank reserves requirements. Also known as, raise or lower the amount of money in the system.

First the central bank, the Fed, does not print money. Only the Treasury Department can do that.  Imagine with me, if the President, Trump, could just call up the mint and tell them to print another trillion dollars, he could do that and either distribute the money or cut taxes, so there'd be incredible political pressure on him to do so.  That would quickly lead to hyperinflation and devastation of the economy.  They tried that setup in Weimar Germany and in Zimbabwe, it didn't end well.
The only way to keep the money supply under control under a fiat currency system is to have a mostly autonomous body in charge of the money supply. 
That's the role the Federal Reserve fills. What it does do is regulate the amount of liquidity in the system.
The fed cannot print money, it can 1) lower fed funds rate (Requiring banks to hold less catch or borrow cheaper from the treasury) 2) open market policy?: Simply buying bonds and putting liquidity into the system.
The most normal tool is control of Fed Funds Rate:
* A bank would like to **lend every dollar it doesn’t** ***have*** **to hold in reserve**. So, as soon as the FOMC lowers the fed funds rate target, banks comply. They then reduce all other interest rates.
* That makes capital more affordable, so businesses and investors are more likely to borrow. If the return on investment is expected to be higher than the interest rate, then investment will look like a good idea. In this way, high liquidity spurs economic growth. That’s just like adding money to the money supply.
The"biggest scam in history" was able to 1) Lift this nation from it's knees and spur activity at a time when the entire system was on the brink of collapse 10 years ago. Also, this scam, by 2) keeping inflation regulated at a target of 2%, that 50 bucks you have in the bank, you can expect it to be worth something reasonably close to that next week. And 3) No depression since it's creation in *it its current form.*
Maybe your right, we should end that scam that has kept this country growing consisitently even rapidly since 1929.

That thought would be original if we were all on our farms in 1902. The idea and creation of the Federal Reserve was born because of the exact question / comment you just posed. It is independent of both the whims of the bankers and the brilliant politicians. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 20:42:18
Bitcoin has been free sailing. Lol. Your confusing monetary policy and free market policy. I am all for free markets.... the common denominator in the transactions between market participants should be regulated. i.e. the fed was born

Please, please don't tell this story in real life. (I am uncomfortable just reading it). I can see your friends and co-workers -- Leaning in / Edge of their seats, smelling blood, ready for the punch line!!..... Then, nothing. I guess people will force a smile as confusion sets in. Poor father...

I mentioned FOMC --- C = Committee... yes the committee meets 8 times a year. And yes they literally set the "Fed Funds Rate" by writing on a piece of paper how much it costs banks to borrow money from the fed. So they literally set a rate at which banks borrow from the US Treasury -&gt; leading to a rate at which they lend (to the public/economy) -&gt; leading to what interest rates are in the market place. 
Straight Quoted:
"The federal funds rate is the rate at which depository institutions (banks) lend reserve balances to other banks on an overnight basis. Reserves are excess balances held at the Federal Reserve to maintain reserve requirements. 
The fed funds rate is one of the most important interest rates in the U.S. economy since it affects monetary and financial conditions, which in turn have a bearing on critical aspects of the broad economy including employment, growth, and inflation. The fed funds rate also influences short term interest rates, albeit indirectly, for everything from home and auto loans to credit cards, as lenders often set their rates based on the prime lending rate.  The prime lending rate is the lending rate at which banks charge their customers. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year, to set the fed funds rate, and uses open market operations to influence the supply of money to meet the target rate. A calendar of upcoming and past meetings as well as press releases from those meetings can be found here."

Yea, like institutions, pension funds, even individuals think of bitcoin as safe. 
As of last year there was $4 Trillion in Municipal bonds and $11 Trillion in Corporate bonds outstanding. \~52% is individuals, individual investors, when it comes to the massive bond market. 
Bitcoin has a long way to go. And GOLD lol.... Gold doesn't produce anything, doesn't have any intrinsic value, and damn sure doesnt pay a dividend. So funny to me - people keep gold as a hedge against economic crises such as joblessness, market crash, etc. But it is important to note that there are not likely to be many buyers of gold when most people are cash strapped in a slowing economy. 
I'd rather own Johnson and Johnson... which has increased it's dividend every year for the last 50 years.

Agreed... It seems that buying crypto became simple. But, in general, accessing it gets expensive and cumbersome.
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:20:58
Many responses are focused around either safety or greed. I don't think greed applies here, as earning 6-7% on your investment is not aiming for the moon.... this is not some "Double your coin in 2 months!" scam. This is essentially partnering with a company that offers crypto backed loans, thus partnering with a historically proven business strategy. Also, I would look at NEXO. I have used them in the past with a fantastic, clean, safe experience. Both as a borrower and a lender. ( I don't know if allowed to post referal link but here you go...[ ). Either way, it's smart to hold and not trade. Best of luck!!!

What is your process? Buy it at exchange and move to wallet? Or have you found an easier convenient method
@_date: 2019-09-22 23:46:11
Yes, and collect consistent dividends that those gold bricks pay out to investors.
@_date: 2018-11-07 05:49:56
So you hold ETH in MetaMask and then you can spend (via loan from NEXO) up to like 50% or something and they hold your collateral?
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:53:19
Well yes, but the idea is short term overnight loans for balance sheet purposes. This certainly does not go on indefinitely. 
You own ABC bank. Because of a few new loans, and some illiquid investments, you resort to the repo market to access overnight liquidity. 
The next day, mortgages are paid, investments mature, and your cash crunch no longer exists. 
If you knew you had a long term cash need, you would issue bonds/preferreds/notes etc. Not rely on repo market.

For USA - an awesome service/app is Crypto.com. Download in the App Store. It's a wallet, you can receive a debit card linked to your wallet, and you can also purchase crypto. IF WANT TO USE PAYPAL: xcoins.io. Super easy instant purchases with paypal. Best of luck!

You get fiat. 
So deposit one bitcoin, at $10,000for example, and up to $700 can be deposited to your bank account. ACH to Checking account is how I did it.

Nexo has created a successful business model based on Crypto backed loans and lines of credit. On crypto-currency held in your Nexo wallet, you can instantly receive an asset based line of credit. (Similar to a line of credit against a portfolio of stocks &amp; bonds)

Well, just like investing in oil or any commodity, you don’t actually take delivery of the barrel. In most cases, people invest in gold and hold it in a bank account. 
In some cases, yes your right. But that’s not feasible to have everything converted to gold bars. If people own bars it’s for long term/legacy planning/etc
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:31:53
I think it irresponsible to come to a blanket conclusion like that. Especially when comparing two asset classes that are on opposite sides of the spectrum.
Take municipal bonds for example:
* (A buyer) Provides funding to a municipality (city, school, airport, etc) in return for regular interest payments. Pre-defined return. Very low risk. Interest/income is federal tax exempt. Regulated and rated. Safety and tax free income is goal.
* Portfolio's we analyze, for example, an intermediate to long term municipal bond portfolio, is yielding between 3% and 4%... So, for someone in a higher tax bracket (30% bracket), the tax equivalent yield is over 5.5%.
* High volatility. Not an income producing asset. Unregulated. Undefined risk profile. Soon to be taxable like capital gains. Capital appreciation and inflation protection is the main goal.
I don't see how two things could be more different. BTW, the year to date return of intermediate municipal bond portfolio is \~10%. Tax free income, safety, and, for the last decade - capital appreciation. I would argue that long term bonds are one of the best/safest places to be for US investors....
Inflation is not something to be concerned about. Further, if we tilt toward a recession, yields will fall, interest rates will go down, fed will cut rates, etc. Above that, US interest rates, I would argue, are high right now. Our rates are high relative to the rest of the world. (EU countries are borrowing money at much lower rates that US right now... There's no reason France, Spain should be borrowing money at cheaper rates than U.S.).
So looking at purchasing bonds right now, most people think rates are too low. However, I would ask: Could rates fall further? Yes. That means that holding bonds would be great, as prices of bonds increase when rates fall.
I don't think holding crypto is a better store of value than a portfolio of bonds
