Wait i'm confused, why would you even want to? Surely there are alternatives to binance with open registrations?

I see, thanks helpful, thanks! Any place I can find real time graphs like these or should i plot them myself? And if so, where can i find the most accurate data in CSV format or something?

Lmao you really value honesty don't you

I used the MICK (my identity check) app, i remember there being a page on bitpanda that stated per country which documents were allowed for verification. Maybe you're in one of the unlucky ones that doesn't accept EU IDs... Which would make little sense since it's the same one in the entire EU. Try looking for that page (i can't see it anymore since i'm verified)

As a nooby, are there any proposed technologies to resolve this right now? I understand there's segwit and LN but these will only make their own transactions easier, not actually "lighten" the rest of the network that doesn't adopt them, right?

If you're in Europe, Bitpanda. Easy as dirt and literally 20 times the customer support than coinbase has (because coinbase's is virtually unexistant -- Still waiting for my support ticket from 8 days ago to be answered)

And most importantly, its massive advantage over coinbase: excellent customer service and easy verification process. Took me less than an hour to get verified on bitpanda, took me 6 days on coinbase. My support ticket got answered within 2 hours as well.

You can verify on bitpanda with just your European ID card, you don't need an international passport. It took me less than an hour. Highly recommend it for beginners. Plus they support segwit and are really valuing customer support and user friendliness.

When does it stop dipping though?

Ehhhhhh...... Not so sure. Bitcoin isn't exactly great for the environment, which is exactly the best reason to become vegan. Hard to see parallels there.

Lol. I'm just gonna assume you're a troll now and go on my merry way. Have fun!

It's so easy to say this though. Tons of people live "life on easy mode", none of them do even a fraction of what he's done. He's turned what he had into something exponentially bigger, revolutionary, visionary. What have you done with what you have?

I mean it's a horrible thing to assume, but let's be honest here, it's thailand. A bachelor white guy moving to Thailand generally raises some questions. I've worked in development aid, and you'd be appalled if you knew the sheer numbers. It's too disturbing to even think about. But i agree it's not something to throw around lightly.
Also he offered his help, he was in contact with the Thai officials and he had done tests. The reasons he didn't actually ship it over was a logistical miscommunication. He showed his emails on all of this. Don't act like he was a dick in this situation, he still did way more than you or me would ever be capable of. The accusation is a different matter though.
