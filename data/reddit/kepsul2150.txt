check again. It looks like the front end is somewhat operational, but trading and transfers have come to a halt.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:46:19
Because there's nothing good to hear about vaporware.

I'm glad you got your's working again, unfortunately not even switching it to dark mode makes my chart appear.  If anyone knows of any mirrors i could try out, please let me know.

An unrelated and obviously an isolated incident, but mtgoxlive.com seems to have died on me sometime yesterday.  All that shows when i load the page is it says mtgox live in the top left like normal, and the help/options are available, but the rest of the page is blank. if anyone knows the cause of this i would be most appreciative.

The seller will still have to accept the purchase.  This might work if the seller hasn't caught wind of the huge price drop.

The difficulty just went up less than a minute ago and just made it over 38% harder to mine BTC.  At this point you're either ASICs or out of the game.

You need to understand that the amount of BTC/blocks mined per day is the same no matter how much hashing power is on the network.  What you need to calculate is how much of a percentage your miner is of the entire network.  Sure, a Jalapeno running right now would generate a good amount of BTC, but that's because it's only competitor right now are the lucky chosen few to receive the first ASICs miners and the soon-to-be obsolete GPU miners.  Think of it like several dogs going after a big steak.  The bigger dogs are gonna get a bigger chunk of that steak, but adding bigger and bigger dogs isn't gonna give you a bigger steak.

I have to expect to see a dump on the market as Avalon liquidates their newly aquired ~60000 BTC.

Doesn't this mean there could be a possibility of a 50% attack?

Are you using the manual mining in easy miner? if so it should look something like:
"bfgminer -o  stratum.btcguild.com:3333 -u YOURusername -p YOURpassword"
Also try to change it between bfgminer or cgminer if you havent already.
Happy unfortunate cakeday btw!
