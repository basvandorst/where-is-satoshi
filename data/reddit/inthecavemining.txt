SegWit has it's own fee structure outside of on-chain fees. Jesus how do people not understand this?
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:33:35
I would argue the opposite. Assuming that mining will magically remain profitable with current block size (or 2 MB) in the face of mining subsidy halvings is the short sighted approach. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:44:34
Your entire premine is false. There is no proof what so ever that node owners are exceptionally sensitive to storage or bandwidth requirement. This is just an assumption that has been propagated by core.
It's exactly as likely that larger blocks would increase the user base of Bitcoin and that the increased user base would lead to an increase in node owners. 
Pretending that larger blocks equals less nodes had no anchor in reality. 
For most of the civilized world even a 20 fold increase in block storage cost would be less than $5/month and decreasing over time. 
Comparing it to gravity is stupid and childish.
I am also not disregarding holders. But sitting on 100k BTC and simply wait to get richer I think most would agree is less a support of the Bitcoin ecosystem than investing $100 million in securing the network. 
Agreed on the miners. But it doesn't account for the miner hostile attitude of core that doesn't even want to meet the mining community for a conversation. 
Most disturbing to me is that the issue of miners somehow being third class citizens didn't arise until China became the mining majority.

The amount of users on exchanges is irrelevant if the blockchain can't support ON CHAIN activity to the audience. Source: MtGox, BitFinex, Cryptsy etc.
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:16:52
Oh dear, do you believe that exchange trades happen on the blockchain?
And, 'make a lot more money'? Reward halving happens for a reason, so blocks need to get big enough to support mining. That's how bitcoin is designed. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:49:30
Sure you can. And you can also make it seem like it's strange that some troll is banned from a slack development channel dedicated to the development of a specific software. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 01:49:10
No. It's 'Bitcoin is a store of value and we don't care about fees or usability for more than 1000 people as long as it's decentralized." vs. "It's already not decentralized, let's make sure a LOT of people can use it". 
@_date: 2017-02-28 12:33:14
That's exactly how it's intended to be. I don't even understand Charlie's argument, WE KNOW that's why they are blocking it. Because down the road, the effective fee space has to allow for more fees to make up for diminishing miner reward. How are you figuring this out now???
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:40:31
OK, SegWit does not. But the payment services that will become standard for smaller transactions and are enabled by SegWit will collect fees from transactions and not directly benefit the miners. 
This is why miners looking forward to the next block reward halving and ahead know that larger blocks for on-chain transactions will be a necessity to keep mining financially viable. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:55:21
You make valid points to a large extent. But I still claim that the 'third class citizens' stamp on miners is unfair and reckless. And the only reason miners were viewed this way in 2010-2011 was the fact that bitcoin wasn't worth much and there was virtually no attack vector. 
The Satoshi Round table was a joke in my opinion, and Core (or part of it) still has to at any point apologize for trying to trick miners with their Hong Kong Accord BS where part of core signed documents they had no authority or business signing, only to break an agreement they had no authority entering into.
I do agree that there is little 'incentive' to run a node for common users. But that doesn't matter for the sake of argument since that incentive is as little today. The simple fact is that miners are more incentiviced to run a full node than anyone else, so that argument falls on its on unlikeliness. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:07:43
The idea that there is a direct correlation between block size and centralization is entirely unproven and so far nothing more than a theory. 
I also consider investments into the infrastructure of Bitcoin far more important than buying and holding as a means of speculation. 
That said, obviously miners aren't the only stake holders. But it's idiotic to pretend they can be disregarded.
@_date: 2017-02-22 18:40:46
And how is that different than when the exact same thing was done using Core? And how is it different than buying miners to push hash rate in a certain direction. 
It's binary voting, it has no intent. How is this hard to understand?
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:05:57
Not at all. I would fully expect it plastered all.iver if it happened in core. (It has). But that's beside the point since that post would also be wrong. 
The entire system of signaling as a product of miners, nodes, and capital is constructed to entire that the stakeholders are the voters. 
If you spend money on mining, Bitcoin or nodes you are a stakeholder. Period. 
There is no illegitimate or fake data. Just like buying shares in a company entitles you to attend share holder meetings no matter if you intend to hold the shares, speculate or just want your voice heard.

Group psychology is a hell of a drug. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 14:50:43
You can dress it up however you like, but fact remains. Miners do not want to trust a possible increase in Bitcoin value when the proven option is to allow more on chain transactions. 
What would you want? A guaranteed 10,000 times $5 or a "most likely" 100 x $500? 
Ideal if course is a mix of both. But I can certainly, considering cores history of not even considering block size increase in a meaningful way understand why miners who have $100s of millions invested in hardware wants to just trust that core somehow has their best interest at heart. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 04:09:52

No "it isn't though". That's an idiot accusation by core supporters. BU just happens to be the latest larger block hard fork proposal, and if core would commit to actually helping miners instead of pretending they are usless we wouldn't even have an alternative. SegWit + 2 MB hard fork would pass unanimously and there are ways of making it painless with wide support. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:50:54

How is this a question? On the Butfinex website in leading up to the hack it was stated that they used BitGo multi-key to protect customer funds. It was stated that BitGo insured customer funds.
Neither of this was true.

@_date: 2017-03-10 16:52:49
Just pointing out that trading obviously has the opportunity to earn you more money than simply holding given that your trading strategy beats the market. 
A failed trading strategy will not, obviously but the entire point of trading is to beat the return of the underlying instrument. 
The fact that many traders have a negative return over holders doesn't change that fact.

That's a terrible dumb argument since core already has a 80% share of nodes and likely to increase. It will get harder to switch, not easier and miners know this. Apparently though you are either too dumb to understand it, or just a shill for SegWit.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:09:42
And you seem (like so many people that don't understand what underpins the actual value of bitcoin) to think that any of that matters if the nodes and exchanges 'validate' a chain with minority hash power and floundering economic value. 
Seriously, if you don't understand that the hardware that secures the blockchain also secures the value, you shouldn't be in bitcoin at all at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:06:19
This isn't a one way relationship you dunce. If miners are supposed to 'do their job' they need an environment that guarantee that their investments in hardware is profitable long term. Aka. Bigger blocks.

Doesn't matter. Since SegWit activation is at 95%, and we are about.. oh, 40% of the way there. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:10:01

Why are we discussing this in circles. A correct multi-signature setup doesn't hand a key to an API, thus allowing 190,000 Bitcoin of customer funds to be stolen. 
No one can be dumb enough to argue that. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:12:56
Prove? They BROKE THEIR OWN TOS! And when they lost $100+ million they stole it from their own customers and replaced it with shit tokens. 
You have to be a damn retard to think that's even remotely legal.
It makes ZERO difference if they give every single customer $1 million dollar in 5 years. They forced customers to accept an asset with lesser value than what they had. That's a crime. Period.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:42:29
Ha ha ha, Exchange that sole $100 million from their customers introduce a second scamtoken and people are all like 'Woohoo, awesome'. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:11:47
That's why I don't think they ask companies to embed them. They discover or buy zero-day exploits, and simply ensures that the company in question cannot patch them, or patch them only in such a way that their malware can circumvent the patch. 
Gets you around that pesky part of the equation.

Pointless to discuss. Bitgo offer customer insurance as a default feature of their enterprise solution. Had the solution of multi-key been setup correctly it would have prevented the hack and Butfinex customers would have been covered by the BitGo insurance. Neither of these were the case. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:06:22
It works real well both ways. 
1. Stop pretending that miners are 'irrelevant' or that we should force them out because they happen to be predominately Chinese.
2. Don't try to change the rules for SegWit activation because the proposal was crafted badly and it will never reach 95%
3. Sure.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:29:42
What? They removed it because they were lazy and gave their API direct access to their cold wallet. This enabled the theft of 190,000 BTC which they then stole from their own customers. ALL of this is fact and a crime.

"won't be hard to replace" Uh-huh. That's why Chinese miners have a 70%+ part of the mining capacity. Cause miners elsewhere are just too lazy to replace them. 
The disconnect between reality and some alternative where 'Hodlers' are the true heroes of Bitcoin in this forum is absolutely mind blowing.
The reality is that if Chinese miners wanted to 'destroy bitcoin' (no idea why the hell anyone would destroy their own livelyhood but that seems to be the theory) they could simply turn off their miners for a week. Confirmation time would go to infinity with 30-40 min average block time, and it would take 3 months for difficulty to reset. 
But no, miners should just sit down and shut up and be so thankful for all that 'free money' their $200 million USD investment earns them.
Want to activate SegWit tomorrow? Just spin up 20k nodes and buy $500 million in ASIC, 'its easy'.

In short. No. There are as many people arguing that Bitcoin is a "digital gold" that doesn't need micro transactions (I think they are wrong) and that status quo is better than SegWit only. And you can't simply dismiss them.

I totally agree that it won't happen without L2 solutions. But I would also argue that you can't just "please the masses" without taking into consideration the fact that we also need a financially viable ecosystem of hardware
My entire point at this intersection is that the best solution would be a "split th difference" solution of dynamic block size increase + SegWit. 
We start with 2MB on-chain blocks + SegWit which results in 4MB+ blocks and all the L2 channels we want. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:40:36
For miners it's about not trusting core to follow through with block size increase in the future. They aren't blocking SegWit because it's a bad idea, they are blocking it because core sees it as the only needed solution. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:39:22
This is a total 100% fallacy due to the fact that miners secure the network from attack. Miner chain will always be economic leader, that is what the people that scream the loudest don't get because they are coders and 'bitcoin purists' but have zero clue as to what the market actually values.
