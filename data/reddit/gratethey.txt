Of course, bitcoin to cash is pretty much instant (and you'll make a little bit of money) with [LBC]( you're definitely at an advantage in receiving BTC.

Don't hold, sell.  Then buy again.  Then sell, then buy again, etc.  As long as you're using exchanges that offer arbitrage, you'll make a small return on your bitcoin instead of it "sitting under the mattress."

Could be later today, as long as 3–5 business days, or never.  Coinbase is awful.

[Coinbase]( ought to work if you use it with Authy/Google Authenticator instead of cellphone confirmation.

This is awesome.  I think that this is what I'll point colleagues towards when they ask what bitcoin is.  Because bitcoin is still something that is largely experienced and not explained.

Yep, [Coinbase]( is pretty much a one stop shop for buying, selling, wallets, receiving, etc.

What website?

Sounds like a neat idea.  Why wouldn't you sell your bitcoins for a markup though, and use that money to pay off your traditional credit card?

Their marketing says that 15% is a good bet for brand new accounts and 5% is guaranteed.  Somebody who recently signed up would be able to tell you if that's true or not.

I just wish I could be selling bitcoin for $827 a piece.
