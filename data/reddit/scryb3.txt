Snarky replies aside, you do make one important point. I agree that we have grown beyond the point where Theymos should be seen as a "most trusted" member of the community. 2 years ago it made a lot more sense.
Today I would like to see these keys be updated to be a multi-party system that requires at least 2-3 non-affiliated signatures before use and have the keys distributed to multiple bitcoin foundation, DATA, and other self regulatory bodies, but I have a feeling that an alt coin will design and perfect a system like that before bitcoin is ready to adopt it.

The group ended up pivoting to an advertising concept and the bitcoin angle got the axe. I got a little closer at the STL Startup Weekend with a payment app that could accept butcoin, but that project has not moved forward and a few issues with the base concept will likely keep it from coming to market.
I'm working on other things full time, but I'm still active in the bitcoin community in STL, come sign up at meetup.com and visit our group sometime! If you want to start something, I'll happily give you my best guidance and any contacts I have that are relevant.

"losing" a couple hundred dollars and "failing to gain" a couple hundred dollars are very, very different things. If prices are set in a fiat currency (that you normally do business in) and the refund policy clearly states that you will be refunding the same "dollar value" if they paid some other way, then there is no loss to the customer except standard volatility risk with the bitcoin they have **after** the refund. If there is still concern that bitcoin refunds could be a problem, you can optionally (or exclusively) offer fiat denominated checks in the mail like you likely do already (and make interest on the refund for a week before sending it out.)

* "P2P Based" assumes they know what P2P is, change to "Peer-to-Peer"
* ditch the background graphics, they detract from the text and the most readable panel is the bottom middle
* What is "Check Why" doing down there? Is it a brand of yours? maybe you need an (r) or (tm) if so?
* "Benefits for Clients" - Clients of whom?
* you say "no fees" at least 3 times, but also say "transaction fees measured in pennies", and have a "1% for cash USD outs" which might be confusing. The Cash Out box is the clearest. Not exactly sure how to address this, but you might want to say "no merchant fees for bitcoin payments" or something...
* USD should always be capitalized, the "no fees" entry has it lower case at the end
* "safe 100%" should be "100% safe" but that could be misleading...
* "new clients" is more appropriate for the hairdresser example or other service industry, restaurants have "Guests" or "Customers" most places
* "Bitcoin Merchants Effectiveness" seems clunky, maybe replace the last word with "results" or "experience"
* "us dollars" should be written "US dollars" (

The demurrage cost is negative overall for the system, but if people stopped losing bitcoins it would become mildly inflationary.
Confusing transaction fees (paid by the sender at time of transmission) and other types of costs is a specious argument to begin with. It's the same as calling inflation a tax, they both take spending power from me, but they are not the same thing (or even directly related on a personal basis.) Another example would be calculating a CC effective fee rate that included inflation or share price of Visa in the equation.
In order to have a valid comparison you have to either compare the whole system to another whole system, or the whole system to other parts of itself (fees vs inflation vs losses.)

Power can be used as a proxy for hash rate, but the analysis needs to go deeper to reduce confidence interval. Right now it is huge. An estimate of the percentage of mining equipment vs other tenants/uses along with the Datacenter PUE (usable computing watts vs input power) and research on the hashing hardware in use (usable watts to hash rate) could be used to close this gap significantly if you are interested in taking this further. 
This has the potential to be a good high level metric that could be helpful in seeing shifting hashing capacity over time, at a minimum you should go after the hashing vs non-hashing number so you can directly compare "power investment" between sites. 
Just some constructive thoughts, hope they help

This is only true in proportion to their existing holdings that have interests in maintaining the status quo. Bitcoin may be a hedge in case their desired outcome fails (along with 95% of their portfolio.)
Of course many actors will want to see even a small investment grow, but being invested does not automatically equate to support for Bitcoin.

The amount of trust that bitcoiners have placed in "unsupervised" (by government/shareholders/board/etc) entities is astonishing, especially given the trustless transaction mechanism that we trying to create. I think it qualifies as textbook irony.
I personally was spoiled by reversible transactions and have had a few site closures and "1-way transactions" with bitcoin, but the maturity of bitcoin companies and vendors who accept it have grown a lot since 2012.
I think a lot of folks have gotten educated in the last few years on how to walk the bitcoin high-wire, and the difference between having a net and not.

Additional response: We would not have voting if consensus was how democracy worked either. There would be no point since the consensus was reached first. This a key reason that bitcoin will be stable, the difficulty of gaining consensus of a diverse population to change things later will be immense. Democracy would simply require a &gt;50% attack and then the whole network would give up on the 49% side.
@_date: 2015-03-13 16:23:47
The 51% attack is an attack on the network, not the unit directly, so the equivalent would be crashing SWIFT and other similar interbank networks.

You are both correct in different ways. The debit card itself is hardware, so is the terminal it is used with, and the servers running the middleware and backend software at 2-4 companies between you you and the merchant. These are however, useless by themselves, and require software, people, and contracts to tie them together. 
The OP also has confusion about what a "killer app" is. It is NOT necessarily a piece of software, it is the application &lt;verb&gt; of the innovation to a problem that solves it well enough to justify the cost of using the innovation. In the case of bitcoin one could argue that "international remittances" (everything from organized services to address exchanges over email and more) are already a killer app for bitcoin, but the cost of learning and using it are still fairly high, so there is room for a "more killer app" of Bitcoin to come along. Like that described by the Original Poster. 
So to be clear, I have concluded in this post that a debit card is hardware, a system, an application, and to be honest something of a "killer app" for my bank account back when it was a new thing... So yeah, you can always use English to misunderstand someone when talking about something this complex, but the real art is in communicating in spite of all this and helping to build a great community.

actually, if they do and cause this result, what are the total rewards over time compared to no action? 30 second block times would generate 13 bitcoins per minute for 12.6k BTC in 16.8 hours, then 3k more over then next 2.8 days and then hitting equilibrium at the second difficulty change. Not a bad little windfall when the equilibrium rate should be ~900/day...
Of course this is only a viable option because the playing field was so tilted in the original assumptions, in a more realistic scenario (51/49) the momentary gain would be tiny, and not worth such machinations.

Who said this was democratic? It's not. NOTHING gets done in bitcoinland without agreement from a significant number of others.
Bitcoin is built by convincing others to do what some people said, and then those people convincing still others. Over time additional maintainers have added more diversity to the conversation, but they have also made it harder to achieve consensus. As this happens in an open source project you start to find the people that are good at communicating the need and rationale for changes and they generally build a core group of agreement before attempting to drop it on the rest of the community out of the blue. Instead of just having a bunch of random code contributors you start seeing them as community leaders who can rally many other developers around their cause to accomplish some very complex tasks.
Linux is not where it is because Linus Torvalds writes perfect code, it's because he knows how to work with others (even if his style does offend some, it works within his community.)
Luke-Jr does not show most of the qualities I see in someone who becomes successful at helping lead a large open source development effort, which is unfortunate because he is a talented and ambitious coder. Perhaps he can see the gap and learn to fill it, but I'm expecting to see him continue down this path, alienating more and more of the community until someone (or ones) get fed up and become an alternate Gentoo fork maintainer that does not even want his input.
Open source is a social enterprise, those that forget this do so at the peril of their push acceptance.

As the size of the network increases, so does the cost of reaching consensus. In 2020 the likelihood is the network will be larger, and this would prevent any large consensus that will negatively impact the existing value.

easy, no need to stress out.
You helped bitcoin by making it a tiny bit more scarce (your coins are not going from trader to trader on MtGox or another exchange) which will help the price find a more natural level for something that is really pretty rare.
More importantly, don't waste your money, then we will have a whole new set of pets.com type bubble companies that can't survive once the novelty wears off. 
Keep looking for things that you DO want to buy with bitcoin, and then buy and spend coins as needed while keeping your "stack" of coins intact, or using them as a float, and paying yourself back. As long as you replenish your coins (and maybe hold them a week or 2 to get a little extra profit) you can spend as much bitcoin as you like, and not worry about the rising price. (Coinbase is a perfect compliment for this, since I can buy the coins, then use float during the transfer wait)
If you know how to do save&amp;spend, doing bitcoin&amp;spend is almost the same.
Now if someone will just manage to make a bitcoin debt card...

I think the reason you got downvoted is that you didn't make the point that this was a personal problem, you implied it was a problem for ALL users.
1 year ago I was in the same boat, now I have better services available to me and can get dollars to bitcoin and back out for a merchant with a total of 1% + $.15 (at least until they exceed $1M on coinbase.)
I'm still not proposing that this is the ONLY way I'll pay someone who does not take bitcoin yet, but I can offer it at a lower cost (less fees) and risk (no chargebacks) if the retailer is interested.

It matters when selecting the NEXT block to build on, IIRC the miners prefer to build on a block with higher difficulty by default.

Because you can get a lot more coverage from a CC company when you can do a secure delivery of a file and track that delivery vs. telling them to trust blockchain.info. The owner has optimized his protection against fraudulent chargebacks and so far it seems to be working, to the point of winning vs. some jerk in Argentina that has taken down at least one other CC:Bitcoin exchanger with chargebacks.
I've talked with the owner a couple times and had a couple minor issues (Google Checkout freaks out if you don't use it for months and then blow it up all at once, anti-fraud on the google side was the biggest headache and that only took 2-3 days to resolve.) but overall the service has been great. Every time I have elected to pay the higher fee to use them rather than waiting on Dwolla/Gox or some other combination, the price has moved MORE than 7% within less time than my traditional transfer would take, for a net gain after fees.
I've spent well over $1000 with them, and will continue to do so when it makes sense, I heartily endorse this service.

Excepting black swan events, I suspect that many miners will mine at a small loss if they think BTC is still rising in price. They might put expansion plans on hold, but as long as the operating electricity cost is covered, it makes sense to continue running in hopes that value appreciation will help pay off the capital expense eventually.
Put another way, I think rising price is more likely than reducing hashrate. Although both are certainly possible, I think the psychological factors of the "game" will keep many folks from turning off any thing that is earning even a little bit.

**TLDR;** I don't think bitcoin mining hardware is a billion dollar business next year, maybe in 2015...
This might be true for an unbounded system, but ASIC's are not free, or instantly available...
Difficulty of 15 billion = ~107 Petahash in the network
ASSUMING that supply could keep up with a 20% rate we are talking about 267,500 nextgen miners at 400GH each at a total cost of $1.5-3 billion in hardware alone. AND production for the next difficulty period would be an additional 53,000 units, followed by a 64k period, 77k period, etc.
Electricity costs are unlikely to get better than .5w/GH in 1 year, and the miners above would be consuming 53MW, or about $70M a year in electricity at a difficulty of 15 billion.
Personally I think that it is unlikely that the exponential growth will continue unabated, reality will interrupt that graph BADLY over the next 12 months, and diminishing economic returns may also impact growth rates after the initial ASIC difficulty surge. 
I doubt that ASIC market penetration will come close to demand within 1 year, difficulty above 1-2 billion seems unlikely, but if the BTC price goes high enough we could see some massive difficulty spikes next year.
Whatever happens it is certain that the ROI on mining vs holding will be a marginal game and those that make the right moves fast enough will be the only real winners.

* Users should be able to authenticate with facebook, twitter or other social media accounts using oauth
* Users should not be presented with duplicate navigation options, currently every button shows up twice on every page (text black bar and orange buttons)
* Employers should be able to select a display name different from their username
* Employers should be able to see a full preview in step 3, leaving the "How To Apply" blank (as is implied is fine) looks very odd on the preview page
* Re above, default text referencing the best way to apply would be helpful
* Users should be able to find the "Apply Online" button more easily, the grey bar is too subtle and it should be replaced with a big orange "APPLY NOW!", centered, directly under the job posting.

You should look at some of the Bills of Materials that count as 1 system that we deal with in Enterprise IT. I have had single line items that take up a whole row of cabinets and cost millions. It's fairly obvious that an "Expansion chassis" allows you to add more hashing blades with this system. The Data Sheet tab also clearly refer to them as "Expansion Cases." You appeared to be being purposefully obtuse in your laundry-listing of "all that is wrong" post.
I did miss the slimline DVD in the middle bottom, the resolution is pretty low. It's not listed on the datasheet tab, so there is no guarantee that it actually is included rather than just a stock photo, call and ask if you care about a $29 part. It may be there because there is a whole computer lurking in that chassis, but there is not any detail about the controller in there, so that's just speculation on my part.

RTFM (Read The Fine Methodology)
Equilibrium 51% Attack Cost: This is a metric attempting to calculate the 51% of the total present value cost required to attack the Bitcoin network through majority hashing power (51% attack). The metric is meant to be viewed as a snapshot in time as if an attacker decided to invest in attacking the network under the current conditions. 
BRIX Score: "Bitcoin Robustness Index" - The relative rank of Bitcoin's 51% attack cost compared to annual military expenditures among all nations.
This metric is equal to 51% of the present value ("PV") of all future revenues derived from bitcoin mining using current Mt. Gox prices. Revenues include both block rewards and transaction fees. The purpose behind using PV as a measuring tool is to approximate the incentives to miners to build upon the Bitcoin network. The measure can be viewed as an aggregate of all the cost-benefit analyses done by individual miners. We believe this is superior to other methods of calculating the attack cost, including variables such as current hash rates and current capital costs, because the model is independent of technology advancements. Under the equilibrium model, miners will continue to invest in equipment until they reach the point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue (the point of profit maximization). Under perfect competition (which is applicable to bitcoin mining), this point will also be where aggregate cost equals aggregate revenue. If we assume the variables that can affect mining revenue are held constant (exchange rate &amp; transaction fees), then we can calculate aggregate revenue by discounting future cash flows. Since we know aggregate revenue equals aggregate cost, by calculating 51% of aggregate revenue we effectively calculate 51% of the aggregate cost to miners. 
Thought Exercise
One of the more prevalent rebuttals regarding this solution is to attempt to calculate the cost to purchase a particular ASIC miner and then extrapolate that cost until it was equal to 100%+ of the current network hashrate (the "Extrapolation Method"). This extrapolation method generally produces an estimated 51% attack cost much lower than our metric. However, the extrapolation method assumes one of two possible acquisition methods that when examined, do not survive scrutiny. The first acquisition method would be for the malevolent actor to produce their own hashing power. However, most extrapolation methods don't account for the time to produce the hashing power and therefore that hashing power will have continued increasing toward the equilibrium level as they introduce their own hashing power. The only way for the malevolent actor to gain majority hashing power in this scenario would be to have superior technology or other methods to produce the hashing power more quickly. In an industry of perfect competition and the commoditization of hashing power, this is unlikely except in the most extreme of scenarios. The assumption that a malevolent actor cannot outpace the production of the entire rest of the ASIC industry seems to more closely mirror reality, and is built into the equilibrium method. 
The second acquisition method for the malevolent actor would be to purchase hashing power from other miners in order to divert current hashing power to their cause. The only way this acquisition method would reach 51% at a cost below the equilibrium model is where the selling miners to make irrational negative NPV decisions. The point where a miner will become indifferent to keeping their equipment or to sell their equipment would be the point where the PV of their discounted future cash flows is equal to the purchase price. However, this is EXACTLY what the equilibrium model represents! Therefore, it is unlikely a malevolent actor could acquire majority hashing power through this method at a discount to the equilibrium model.
This metric is meant to represent a model at equilibrium. Therefore it represents a snapshot of 51% of the incentive to miners at the current price and current transaction fee levels. The idea is that miners are willing to invest in the network as long as it is profitable to continue doing so. We assume the following:
Rational Actors: We assume all mining participants are rational actors and strictly pursue profit maximization. We ignore all other motivations, including political, emotional, and reputational. All other heuristics and biases are ignored.
Static Variables: We assume that the variables in the model are static, and therefore represent a 'snapshot in time'. There are no growth forecasts for either price or transaction fees.
Perfect Competition: We assume that all miners and potential attackers have access to the same technology, resources, and information. There is no technological advantage for any party that would exclusively decrease mining costs or otherwise acquire mining equipment faster.
Discount Rate: 15% Our model discounts future cash flows by 15%/year.

Coinlabs is working on something similar, IIRC. I think it comes down to a need for researchers to pay the public computing cloud for their work efforts instead of just hoping for donated cycles. At least that is the case if you want to tap into this kind of hashing/computation power...

Pick one, Time or Money.
Right now BitCoin is expensive in one or the other, you get to pick which you want to optimize for.
Once you have used btcQuick enough to get Silver or Gold level the turnaround it's pretty predictable (as long as you remember that 1 guy runs the show in the US, and does not stay working 24/7) and the fees are far less than $5-6/coin (more like $1.40) which given the rates the CC companies charge is pretty low margin.
Same for VirWox (although I still don't like the small-change issues) when you get down to it, they provide good time-value compared with cheaper alternatives.
Personally I use some Dwolla for regular payments (scheduled payments happen ON  the day you create the schedule, awesome for pay-day) and CC on btcQuick (for more tactical opportunities like IPO's or price dips) when I can see more than a 7% advantage over waiting 1 week. Coinbase might be getting more of my trade, but I have to wait a month to really know if they are better for me.
Welcome to early-adopter land, everything is under construction, and if you think you can do better (like the guy from btcQuick did) you should try to do so, you might become the next big thing!

I think you should write a proof of your points into a professionally laid out report and provide a 1-page (HARD!) executive summary of your key points and benefits of investing in bitcoin and potential valuations quoted from media sources (Max Keiser is good for a $100k-1M/bitcoin quote or 5.)
If you show the initiative and point to verifiable information (FINCEN, Malta Hedge Fund, IG Markets Futures, etc) they are likely to be impressed with your initiative and thorough report. If they are not take the report to the competition and get a job with them taking advantage of the opportunity ("and the idiots at my last firm could not see the opportunity") 
I expect their ears might perk up if you tell them that the Exante Bitcoin Fund in Malta started with $3M which is now worth over $18M (80k coins)
Looks like a big opportunity, good luck however you go!

* $1 worth of bitcoin at $200 (for easy math) = .005 bitcoin = 5 mBTC (milli-bitcoin) = 5,000 uBTC (microbitcoin) = 500,000 satoshi (smallest possible unit of bitcoin today)
* There are 8 decimal places available, so there are multiple stops between full units (like dollars) and the smallest (similar to cents, but you would need a Winnebago to haul them if they were physical.) It's a good idea to use these abbreviations instead of saying .0000025 BTC because it's really easy to mis-count the number of zeros and send too much or too little by a factor of 10 (or 100, or more if drunk.)
* The word "cents" is discouraged, since it denotes 1/100th, and also can be conflated with USD value. (and calling things that are not issued by the US government dollars or cents can get you put away for counterfeiting)
* So to recap, 1 BTC = 1,000 mBTC = 1,000,000 uBTC = 100,000,000 satoshi.

it says right there on the item that it requires membership, and if you never view the membership item you don't even see the most basic information about the fee structure.
So either you ignored the instructions to buy the bronze membership (or use the free "REDDIT" code that was released a while back:  OR you failed to even understand the fee structure under which you were buying.
I actually think the message was "I don't want to follow your policies" and "I don't care if you go bankrupt because of chargebacks" so you really can't blame him if he's not going out of his way to make YOU happy.

I don't see the "SDICE is Tied To Fiat Prices" argument as being very compelling.
It is true that some folks will be willing to buy (and gamble) less bitcoins as they are worth more, but by definition that will mean that there are more people interested in BTC that are driving up the price (and using SDICE for he first time.)
To me it appears that at least in the near-mid term, SDICE should at worst be flat, and it should go back up 15-20% once the recent glut of shares is gone and short-term profit taking is complete.
With 30-50% estimated dividend rates, it's unlikely it's going DOWN...
Don't go overboard, only invest what you can afford to lose, past performance is not an indicator of future performance.
@_date: 2013-02-22 04:28:18
You might want to consider pegging your fee to the Dollar or the Euro instead of fixing a BTC price. With 50% price increase this month, it's obvious that prices will have to be adjusted on a frequent basis, better to let a script handle that and use the current price than risk over/under-charging.

Oh, they exist in practice too, try passing a forged check sometime. Or overdraw your account for a a few hundred dollars and don't fix it.
If you are trying to make the point that the banks are more restrictive than the law requires them to be, I will certainly concede that this is the case. That's because the VAST majority of banking laws actually apply to the banks, and they have to figure out how to do business in a very uncertain environment.

I'm pretty sure that the network would only propigate and build on the HIGHEST difficulty block.
The more interesting question to me is "how do you measure 2 hours?"
If this change was made I think the network would be under continuous attack with folks trying to convince the other peers that THEIR block is from more than 2 hours in the future by faking timestamps or other means.
IMHO that's the real risk with bitcoin, messing up the game theory that underlies it and makes it antifragile.
@_date: 2013-04-28 16:26:25
... which could mean the mixing service would lose all their honest members/coins and become a pure pool of taint for taint transactions.
Not assured outcome, but it could be that the tainted coins will tend to collect in the black market portions of the network, while un-tainted coins will be hoarded and reserved for use within the honest portion of the network.
Thanks for the thought experiment.

If you are interested in investing in SDICE, this IS the time to do so, IMHO.
The price was .0073 a few days ago, it's now stuck at .0062 because of a 3M share dump with poor communication, but that DOES mean that 1M shares are still available at ~17% under par.
Get in while folks that bought at .0044 or .0055 are taking a modest profit, or from the 3rd tranche, it's there for the taking as well.

I think this "speculation or spending" argument is a fallacy right up there with the "money or nothing" arguments we hear from some corners. It's a false dichotomy where in fact both uses are viable for bitcoin at the same time. 
Saving bitcoin does not reduce the number of units available for commerce in a meaningful way, even if 99% is "hoarded" the remaining 21 trillion units are available for trade, and more can be created (without diluting savers value) if needed by moving from 8 to 12 (or more) decimal places.

I'm not sure why you think it does not make economic sense. The ROI for the first adopters is obvious.
You also seem to have missed Avalon shipping, and ButterflyLabs is way beyond a scam at this point.
It's not like anyone is talking about shipping millions of mining rigs, but if the price of bitcoin goes up enough to justify that many, they will ship them.
$17 seems to be settling in well, and soon enough it will break up or down again, but generally the price will rise as more folks learn about it and want to own a few coins.

Think about what you are asking for...
- Please give me money now, for something I want to ship later, when your bitcoin might be worth 2-10 times as much.
Selling goods in bitcoin already requires a discount to promote some people to spend it, the level of discount required for a slow shipping item would likely be beyond what you could reasonably offer.

If you can get the price that low it would be awesome, but I think $149 or $199 would sell too if the chip was faster. maybe make a "standard" version with this exact hardware, and a "pro" version that is twice the price, but 5-10x the calculation speed (maybe a faster and/or more durable print head too)

Sellers who want to "cash out" can do so within 15 minutes of accepting the order with no exchange risk.
Why would they hold bitcoin longer if they need to exchange it? Your entire premise leading up to "the dump" is seriously flawed.
Trying to use existing (and very slow) systems that are built around assumptions like daily or monthly clearing completely ignores the electronic and programmable nature of the bitcoin system. 
It's like complaining that you will have to open each envelope on every spam email that is delivered to your door to let your email spam filter check it. You could build a system with that flaw by having someone print and snail-mail you your email queue, but WHY?

The FT reported on the recent tightening of controls in Indonesia, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Russia. ... In Taiwan the access that foreigner investors have to certain bank deposits has been restricted. The FT cautioned that imposing controls has a downside including the creation of possible future problems in attracting funds."

this is a common way to exchange BTC when there is no need/desire to wait for confirmations. As long as the seller can be trusted in the short term the buyer can spend the coins right away (to their own wallet or to make a purchase) rather than waiting for confirmations.
If you are buying private keys to hold you should import them and spend them to a trusted address rather than leaving them in the compromised one.

If you don't want to spend bitcoin that's a different thing altogether. The point of the post is that you CAN spend them and eliminate exchange risk, not that you NEED to.
Even in your case you could send the money to the exchange, and then wait a few days to make your purchase, but if there is no reason you want to do this I understand why you would not go to the trouble.
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:38:30
Let me answer a bit more realistic scenario first. FAR more likely that at least 10% would still be online, reducing the impact by an order of magnitude. This would still mean 1 block every 1.6 hours (likely .5-4 hours because luck will be a big factor) per block and readjust in ~140 days.
Note, that the difficulty adjustment is limited to 0.25-4x so the difficulty in 140 days would adjust to 2.5x ideal (assuming **NO** hashing power comes online again)
IF we ever actually see 99% of hashpower disappear then we would be running at 100x of ideal difficulty, so it would actually take 4 difficulty adjustments and ~1950 days (5.3 years) to come back to a 10 minute block (again assuming that there is no added hashpower.)
Some possible actions in the face of this disaster:
In theory if the bitcoin network was mature to the point that there was a large off-blockchain clearing mechanism available then we might see the end of **common** use of the bitcoin **network** for **fast** transactions as solutions like Ripple are used more for transferring funds between sites and internal transactions are handled locally (extension of what coinbase is doing for microtransactions with off-blockchain "clearing", just extend it to every major wallet provider and exchange)
This *"limp-along"* strategy shows that a functional network with slow transactions is possible, and could be used to address the "disaster"
If 99% of the hashpower goes away that is a **great** incentive to but/build additional mining hardware. Returns on mining equipment that survived the event will also be 100x what was expected (assuming you can get some) so it should skyrocket in price and resale of working equipment could be quite lucrative.
This *"new hashing gold rush"* strategy shows that there is tremendous incentive to create new hashing power and normalize the network.
Thirdly there is the chance of developer intervention. With the cooperation of enough miners the dev team could put in a 1-time difficulty change at a specific blockheight to allow the network to get back on it's feet again in a hurry without leaving a long-term attack handle behind. It's also possible that a permanent change could be made to handle future iterations of this event, but I think that it would be considered unlikely to repeat AND leaving any "if this happens then the difficulty rules change" code behind is **asking for trouble.** 
This *"bow before the power of the core devs"* strategy is MOST likely to create a forked coin, but the others could as well.
In short I think there are economic/market correction fixes for most scenarios where the bitcoin network is seriously damaged, but if it gets really, really, really bad, it can be fixed it in a 1-off or perpetual manner (with some risk.)

Daily turnover is over 10x the new supply added each day (25 * 144=~3600 new coins a day) and we have over 40k public blockchain transactions per day (
Even assuming that new coins entered the market in a perfectly efficient manner the new supply is nowhere near the demand at the current value, so the value will keep going up overall (while the demand keeps going up, causing accelerating growth unless new demand stops.)
Don't wait for it to stabilize, just mark your goods at $ prices and do the conversion on demand. That way with the current trend you can bank more at then end of the day than you actually sold due to price appreciation, if you hold some of your BTC for a week or 2 you might even find a way to undercut your competition (at a risk of course.)
As always, past performance is not an indicator of future performance, do not invest more than you can afford.

You make the case that there should be as few restrictions as possible, consider that the restricted uncertainty is a primary feature of Bitcoin, and any place you try to remove "protocol restrictions" you are also increasing uncertainty and risk of an exploitable weakness.
You may also want to re-examine the way your frame your slippery slope argument. The 21M coin limit is immutable in bitcoin itself, but is only a measure of the static money pool, not the bitcoin economy in motion. Including securities and loans denominated in bitcoin we will certainly have more than 21M claims on bitcoins, but there is no risk to the core protocol because of this.

I just realized that there might be a good reason NOT to use standard scientific unit breakpoints with bitcoin. 100,000,000 satoshi/coin = 100 * 100 * 100 * 100, so 4 equally sized 100th units will fit more elegantly than 2 1000th units and 1 100th.
Not sure if others will agree, and there is also a lack of names for these units beyond centi, but the 4 evenly sized units are something I'd never thought of before.

Or the value of bitcoin will have to increase such that the existing fee is sufficient to pay for operations...
Or the existing fee will be astronomically high and need to be lowered because bitcoin hits $100,000 ($50/transaction)
Or (most likely) the fee limit will continue to be used only for anti-spam purposes, and will be lowered as needed to remain relevant in a growing open market of transaction fees based on what senders WANT to pay based on their needs. Eventually this market-based approach should lead to a meta-stable state where adding a fee of a given size predictable gives one an immediate, 4 hour, 24 hour, 7-day, 30-day, etc. confirmation time SLA. Clearinghouses or similar institutions will also be able to contribute to stable and predictable confirmation rates by partnering with miners to get their customers blocks mined within this SLA on a different fee basis, likely long-standing commercial agreements.
Whichever way it goes, the days of predictable "I put in a no-fee transaction, and it goes in the next block" are over, and they might be numbered for minimum-fee transactions too.
