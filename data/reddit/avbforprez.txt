Because what the world has been asking for is a special type of extra money, that costs a little bit more than normal money despite being accepted nowhere.

Isn't this already the case (serious question)?
Having dabbled with BTC to the tune of double my money early on, I have nothing against it. That said, I always read that 25%+ of the coins are owned by a handful of people, and the volume of unused coins is 70-80. It's "market" was almost entirely based on trading/currency, or at least that's how it came across to me. 
The early adopters with that 25% or more of a billion $ market are likely self-aware enough to realize that tasking enthusiastic new-adopters with selling it could work out. Everyone spreading the Bitcoin message is largely doing so because of a belief in what it will be one day, and because their true...liquidity?...depends on that sales pitch to the world being a success. 
TL;DR - of course the Bitcoin market is/was/will be crooked as all hell. Its early enthusiasm was largely from people outside of "normal finance," to be very euphemistic.

TL;DR - lots of people are not aware that they have a speculative currency and that they're needed to increase the perceived value of said currency in order to cash out ("future').
Bitcoin can work, but as it chugs along I'm legitimately surprised at how infrequently this aspect is discussed. As it stands now, Bitcoin is not something even close to spendable without proactively looking for places to use it. It's the biggest sales pitch of recent history, but it may work because the salespeople don't realize they're the pitchers. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:26:32
There is actually a foolproof template for Bitcoin scams that I'm surprised isn't used more often. It is as follows:
1. Are you receiving Bitcoin from other people?
EDIT - There is no way that the person shown "finishing" their cross country run actually ran from Miami to San Francisco. Absolutely no way. Unless the definition of "running" is taking a few selfies, walking around a bit, and then getting back in a car. 
Like pretty much every Bitcoin company, this seems far more likely to be a scam than a legitimate organization. Obviously some of the money has gone towards what looks like an ambiguously active food bank, but the lack of photo and video documentation supporting the claims is extremely suspect.

Real answer, even though people think I will be trolling - immediately take out 95% of what you have in there and accept that you were hasty and foolish. Nobody from your family or friends will care about Bitcoin or see it as anything other than a scam/ponzi/pyramid that you were taken in, even though you think it's neat and the future etc etc.
Maybe meet with groups or people who have fallen victim to scam investments and learn how to move forward. In the near-imposible scenario where Bitcoin goes to whatever moon price people claim, that 5% will end up being a lot.
Negativity about Bitcoin the technology isn't allowed here via downvoting, but I'd be surprised if this experience hasn't opened your eyes to it. eGold has been done before, it always failed. Paper alt-currency has been done before, it failed.
If you lose 50% of that money, which it sounds like you have, your family will be rightly hurt but not broke. If you don't get the fuck out now and lose all of that money, or god forbid do something like put more in there.....you've ruined their finances.
Accept that you've gambled away the money and that this perception of what you've done is reality.

It gets better, more from the BC crew
That's the "address of the incorporator", not the business. It's his house. Based on the names I suspect it belongs to his dad.
What you want is the "principal place of business", 1999 Massachusetts. 
This is a vacant wooded lot that they let homeless people put tents on. AKA Satoshi Forest. AKA swamp land that floods regularly, which is why it was vacant.
The "outpost thrift" location is 4406 N. Palafox Street, Pensacola, FL. Google's displayed number (4482) is wrong, the correct address can be read on the mailbox. Link: 
I should feel bad, but this is all the public paper trail that they want people to follow for some reason. Another oddity comes from the open letter thingy where he mentions the resident agent:
3) Mailing to me, instead of our registered agent, caused a delay in receiving the notice until the middle of October, as it had to be forwarded to me in Orlando.
He's saying he doesn't operate the day to day affairs of the charity, and none of the other corporate officers live in Pensacola to do business out of his registered office. One question is why doesn't he take a more active role in the charity, while the other obvious one is whether he even lives in Orlando at all given Florida's laws.
The part I feel bad about is noticing that the owner of the parcel listed as the business office has the same last name as the individual who wrote that open letter. Do his parents really know what he's up to while identifying their house as his non-profit's business office?
@_date: 2014-11-21 04:07:20
Interesting comment from the Buttcoin crew:
If you check out the articles of incorporation (
) of a firm, and find that they operate out of this ramshackle piece of shit ( it might raise some red flags. Does that represent the "outpost thrift" lease they disclose?
Since I have no clue about these people or this charity, I couldn't tell you. However, misreading the word "registered" as "resident" gave me flashbacks of Nevada, where out of state corporations have to pay a fee to a state resident to vouch for them with the department of state. Annual fee, sort of like the thing the charity owner talks about getting nailed on before he got his articles of incorporation reinstated on the 15th.
Which should lead to the very obvious question, why is their registered agent a different person at a different Pensacola address? The relevant Florida statute says that the Registered Agent can be:
1. An individual who resides in this state whose business office is identical with such registered office.
2. A foreign or domestic entity authorized to transact business in this state, having a business office identical with such registered office.
Just going by the language of  it doesn't appear these people even reside in Florida. I don't necessarily blame them given the property they list as their business address. (edit: it's almost as if they're using the legal loophole that they don't have to file actual non-profit reports because they don't solicit for USD to get away with just collecting butts - and oops, that last link was for LLCs. corporations should be the same though.)

This review makes me want to see it right away:
Who are bitcoins for? If you go by stereotype, it's narcissistic libertarians who see themselves as visionaries punished for their daring individuality by a tyrannical government whose raison d'être is to stamp out personal freedom wherever it can because, uh, for the heck of it, I guess. Nicholas Mross confirms the cliché in The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin, a circle-jerk for bitcoin zealots who speak primarily in self-deluded Silicon Valley PR drivel. Mross's brother Dan is described by his wife as "chang[ing] the world and mak[ing] it better" because he hosts a bitcoin server in his basement. "It's the smartest people in the room that are the most excited about this," declare the Winklevoss twins, who just happen to own 1 percent of all bitcoins.
The doc divides the world into two kinds of people: the prophets and the rubes. At a New Hampshire convention, Dan sips from his coffee, smacks his lips, and sighs, "Tastes much better when bought with bitcoins." Alternating between talking-head interviews and animated PowerPoint presentations, Rise and Rise does offer fascinating details when it suspends its relentless cheerleading to chronicle the online currency's mysterious origins, sensational growth, and troubling ancillary industries (e.g., money laundering, gambling, drug sales, theft of bitcoins). Though the Mross brothers cop to the currency's checkered history, the film never offers a serious exploration of bitcoiners' naïveté or regulation-phobia. Thus, rather than the currency itself, the film's most compelling subject ends up being the separatist psychology of its self-regarding fanatics. By Inkoo Kang

You forgot to mention that Ross told them "please take a picture next to the dead body that shows the following numbers: 123456789" (he made up some specific code).
And then after creating a professional grade staged murder scene, took a picture with said numbers and sent it to Ross. To PROVE THAT THE MURDER HAD TAKEN PLACE, WHICH HE RECEIVED AND ACKNOWLEDGED.
