Way more than that...
.2^100 = 1 / 7.88 x 10^69

Coin age shouldn't zero out when a coin is involved in a transaction. That is a weak implementation. Coin age should be a secondary accumulation that is assigned to each address.  If this were the case, even if one person had 90% of the coins, the minority share could still sit back and accumulate enough coin age to force their own blocks (and transactions) through.
Then coin age would in effect become a secondary currency that could be combined and traded between addresses (to facilitate block creation among smaller addresses).
Other side effects would be that during high traffic periods (with presumably high numbers of fees) blocks would be more rapid, as people are attempting to collect the available fees faster spend coin age, and during low traffic periods blocks would spread out more.
The attack you are talking about would be completely ineffective assuming there was any minority position that ever owned any coins.  This system so obviously is superior to PoW it is incredible that all coins haven't adopted it as the long term strategy after initial seeding.

Conceptually it seems like days destroyed would be a fairly constant number.  Yea, potential days destroyed would build up over time, but at some point they would be spent at a roughly constant rate.  If you were to compare two currencies one could be transacting far more commerce, but recycling largely the same coins and have fewer days destroyed than another coin that sits around then was moved internally at an exchange.  Days destroyed doesn't really represent any kind of economic measure, but is a great way to prevent spam in the blockchain by prioritizing transactions with the largest coin destruction.

You only control a fraction of coin age.  Assuming clients use the chain with the highest coin age expenditure, your secret chain would never be used.

So at best this supports some kind of 5-10 block deep checkmarking, and since PoS coins can have 10 second blocks while being functional, they will still be faster than PoW while being more secure.

There are actually significant changes in bitcoin on the horizon to allow two-party escrow services.  Essentially you place say 100 bitcoins in an account that can only be accessed when both parties agree the transaction is complete (goods arrive, programming completed, etc.).  There is no way for the buyer to receive the items without paying, and no way for the seller to get the money without performing the services.  It will be revolutionary for anonymous internet transactions.

And people will stop shopping at Walmart, McDonalds, Amazon, and other "legitimate" businesses.  Government attempts to legislate against bitcoin will only put more of the market underground.

I've always thought that the block rewards should decay to 1btc/block.  That would insure that even though money is leaving the system through accounts being lost and people dying etc., the system will eventually approach a situation where bitcoins created = bitcoins destroyed.

How do you know it didn't happen?  The largest mining pool (BTCGuild) got the block.  The success of a fork of this type is based on the square of mining proportion divided by the remaining network size, so pools below a certain threshold would do better to continue mining normally.
Someone who has lower power cost will indeed be mining earlier in a block's life.  It's not a risk if you are giving up a trivially small collection of transaction fees.

Or very often when the basic block reward goes to 0 and transaction fees are the primary incentive to mine.
It's also yet another incentive to centralize mining.

29 BTC from GPU's?
That's ~40,000 mhashes running for 2 weeks.  $1000 bucks in electricity...  Probably another $5000 in destroyed cards from crappy miner settings.  There should be way more anger over this.

You must also consider factors such as velocity.  There was a study done a while back, Bitcoins so far have an average transaction velocity per month in the ~6 range.  Cash is very close to this value, and both seem to act as substitutes.  M0 is around $1 trillion, and I think the US dollar generally dwarfs any other currency.  Adding the rest of the cash from other currencies might come to another $1 trillion.
There were some initial guesses that were saying the entire $50 trillion global economy divided by the number of bitcoins, but this seems absurd given how money actually functions.

You could also have a reverse transaction to encourage confirmation.  So let's say I'm selling something for 10 BTC.  They send the money to the two factor account.  I send the goods.  There isn't really any incentive for them to now validate the transaction, especially if it is anonymous.  But if instead I charged 11 BTC with a 1 BTC refund on confirmation we've dramatically improved the incentives all around.

This assumes a constant increase in difficulty, which is absurd.  Difficulty increases over the next month will likely never be matched again until we get quantum mining or something else.  2X nm chips are essentially mature technology and once those have some market penetration, network growth will at best be liner.
