Sounds like they’re committing fraud. If possible, try sending your bank images of them giving you their btc address, a vid of you accessing your wallet and all the relevant transfers etc to show that it was you who sent the coins and them who received them.

Great idea! Especially if it is for companies looking to help out the crypto ecosystem rather than traditional businesses, let me know what you think?

Maybe be your btc to a new wallet ASAP if you are worried, if it’s a substantial amount then maybe consider a hardware wallet. 
Don’t worry, you’ll be fine!

Wow, the type of regulation thy talk about in this article is actually good and I personally would want it. 
‘We need compelling reasons for crypto firms to locate in the UK’ 
Jheez, this is big. The UK WANTS crypto firms. 
And they will establish a policy which protects consumers without influencing price. 
This will draw new money to the space, as one of the main reasons new money isn’t flowing is that crypto is open to scams. 
Bravo, United Kingdom, bravo.
