I don’t know bout putting funds in. I only joined them to cash out and since he’s asking bout cashing out figured I’d tell him a great choice for that.

Well tbh I started investing around end of October /17 and I’ve done so well. I haven’t needed to really deposit anything else since then and when I did I did use Coinbase here and there.

Yes! Crypto is an alien currency. People just don’t realize.

Hands down I have 1 source.
You can direct deposit to your bank in 1-3 days they even have e transfer just not active atm. 
Very legit. Needs verification obviously. You can use Equifax and be approved instantly.

From gatehub my transaction history. 
Yeah they haven’t even initiated anything at all to the address in my transaction history with them. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:46:57
I’ve messaged them like 6+ hrs ago and still nothing from them either. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:27:59
Did u email them? If so any response ?
It’s actually unreal cuz I can’t track it anymore after XRP which says its successful and they haven’t started the next transaction to the btc address I requested. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:46:13
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:05:05
It’s never been sent I’ve been checking on blockchain.info
Pretty much they’ve received it and never started the transaction to my address 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:35:09
Thanks .... I’ll def stay away from there after this situation. Their fkn fees are stupid high too 
0.0020 for a btc withdrawal disgusting.
