An initiative for streamlining ETF approvals was introduced in 2008 but quickly sidelined by the financial markets meltdown.  The effort was revisited by the SEC early 2013 and may be used by the twins and their Bitcoin ETF.  The novelty of Bitcoin may mean they can not claim the necessary exemption to fast track, but I'm sure that the twins know time is money.  An amendment to their ETF proposal was already submitted in OCT 2013 in order to clear up confusion at the SEC examiner's office, so, realistically, the SEC could announce their approval before the China deadline.

There is overhead for miners to attach transactions to blocks so there is an incentive to find blocks without transactions to reduce the chance of an orphaned block.  I believe there is work to make the incentives better for the miners or at least reduce the incentive to mine without transactions.

Right now, adoption of Bitcoin is in its infancy.  For the USA to crush Bitcoin, which they can not allow to exist long term, they need to issue something close enough and have mainstream acceptance.  If its easier to grok than Bitcoins, Bitcoin will lose, even if Bitcoin offers significant advantages.
