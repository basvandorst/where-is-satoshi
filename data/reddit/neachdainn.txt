Protip: look at the address... it may look like coinbase, but it is not.   They’re just trying to get you to enter your account info (if you had an account), so that they have it, and can empty your account. 
This is why 2FA is important.

It’s a real thing, and a good catalyst for learning about lightning. 
As for onboarding, where are you located? For a lot of first timers looking to get their feet wet, CashApp (US) and Newton (CA) are super easy ways to buy your first BTC and transfer to a wallet. If you’re looking at more substantial purchases, exchanges are best, but take more time and have more hoops to jump through.

Day trading is gambling. The odds are that your stack will disappear. 
Compare ROI for day trading vs. just holding since the start of the year, and you’ll likely find that holding offers a better return. 
After all, the house always wins when gambling.

I think there are genuine use cases for several cryptos. Some will function well as a store of value, others will shine for every day transactions or more specialized ones. 
Dozens, or even hundreds of cryptos? Nah, those are just shitcoins with the express purpose of making a select few rich. 
As someone wise once said.... SALVE hodlers.

Of course it’s a scam. 
If you really feel like your life is incomplete without opening it, go ahead... on a computer at the library, that you’ve never used for anything crypto-related, and for the love of sweet baby Satoshi, do not provide any personal information. 
Or, just make your life easier and delete the message.

I think any study you find will be horribly biased for one side or the other, but [this]( one is an interesting comparison, if for no other reason than comparing BTC to an entire financial system, rather than just a network (Visa) that still has to piggyback off the banking system.

Thanks, fellow hodler!

BlueWallet is a pretty decent custodial wallet. Easy to use.

Transactions are lumped into blocks, and the block reward (12.5 BTC) is rewarded (plus transaction fees) when the block is solved. 
While it is theoretically possible for one miner to solve a block, the odds are astronomical. That’s why miners join a pool. Combined, their hash power is high enough to solve a block, and the miner gets a percentage of the block reward, proportional to the amount of effort they contributed. Different pools have different rules, but that is the jist of it.

I don’t think there is much to be conflicted about. 
If one day, you woke up and Coinbase ceased to exist, how would you feel knowing that your coins are gone. 
I’d imagine that would be enough impetus to start controlling your own keys.

I’ve actually been having a hard time finding an OTC that is willing to pay a premium on freshly mined coins. They may charge a premium, but they certainly don’t offer one.

Network fees both ways, plus whatever your exchange charges on withdrawal, if they charge anything. 
I transfer all my DCA purchases off exchange ASAP. I don’t mind paying fees as they are pretty minimal as long as you can set your own priority.

I’m sure it happens, but based on the current difficulty, the odds are about 1 in 1.89e21 using an S9 hashing at 14.5th/s.... so, yeah... pretty low odds.

Check out Newton.co. No fees, easy to use, integrates well with your bank. 
you’ll be stacking sats in no time.

DCA. Buy what you can afford to lose, when you can afford it.   Taking out a loan to purchase a speculative asset with a history of 80%+ losses isn’t my idea of a sound financial decision.

That’s per 10 minutes, and the number would be 189,000,000,000,000,000,000/1, if I counted decimal places correctly.
@_date: 2019-06-09 02:04:08
Yup, that’s the jist of it, but it’s playing the lottery, with astronomically poor odds.
@_date: 2019-06-09 03:10:35
All hinges on your hashrate as a % of the pool. You’ll also pay a pool fee out of your payout. At the end of the day, if your power is cheap enough, you can make $, albeit not much. 
Mining is very much about economy of scale.
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:06:03
Even better, waste heat from ASICS to cook your pizzas! I’m sure there’s some way to do it using math and science.

Excited on getting my wife set up to accept lightning/btc at her market stall. Even if only one person uses it, the visibility and conversations help increase mainstream adoption. 
For myself, the prospect of being able to purchase while traveling without having to carry tons of cash, or get absolutely reamed by CC fees is exciting. It’s still a ways off, but tech like lightning makes a huge difference in the feasibility of using crypto in everyday situations. 
@_date: 2019-06-18 04:09:13
Maybe. Maybe not.

I’ve been pleased as punch with Newton.co. Cheap and easy, direct payments to/from my bank account. iOS only at the moment, but the app is stellar.

In Canada the far-right, immigrant hating demographic has latched onto the yellow vest movement. Not in principle, of course, but as a way of pretending that they stand for something beyond their blind hatred of anyone that doesn’t prescribe to their political views, or has a visible difference in skin colour.

With free power, it can be a fun hobby, but that’s all.

Newton.co integrates seamlessly with your bank account, and works pretty darn slick for DCA.

There seems to be some debate as to if the hashrate actually dropped.  Some places showed it, others did not. It is basically back to normal now.

The most popular choice from a non-custodial standpoint is BTCPayServer. You host your own payment server, so the transaction is trustless. 
Plenty of other options out there, many are custodial.
