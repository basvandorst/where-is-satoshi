Facebook is a company though

Haven't checked but is there really another sell wall at 17.8? Is it as bad as it was at 17.25?

His calling "Bitcoin Cash" "Bitcoin" is purposely deceptive.
I agree with your last paragraph which is why I'm dumping my BCH into BTC. I believe in BTC, whereas BCH, in my opinion, was a bandage solution on a temporary problem.

Your "what-ifs" are irrelevant. Roger Ver himself has stated that he is promoting Bcash as Bitcoin. On a Reddit post in r/BTC.
Imo, dumping Bcash is a good idea. Get rid of that trash fake.

I can't, sorry. I know next to nothing about it.
I did find this page [Lightning Network]( that seems to explain what it is/does.
Skimming through it, seems like transactions can occur off the blockchain. Definitely going to look into itcand there's a video at the bottom too.
If someone can still explain, I'm open to that too

He just made rent for several years, meaning he won't need to use that money for several years. 
If he won't need the money for several years, what's the harm in half now/half later?
No one is saying it won't go down, they're saying the reward vastly outweighs the risk

The lambo speaks?! **glorious**
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:12:42
Good point, didnt think of that

Your five year old should probably be more inquisitive. He/she would learn a whole lot about the world 
@_date: 2014-01-24 04:10:29
I would imagine that more vendors accepting it and making news would result in more people becoming involved/interested and buying in
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:45:42
You're going to be a hoot as it continues to drop before bouncing back up.

Not sure actually but they're still sealed.
Are they supposed to have .01 BTC paper wallets inside?
@_date: 2018-11-18 02:17:11
Woah, I had no idea. 
Any reason why this particular issue sells for more?
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:18:03
I don't know if I will detach myself entirely buy I will definitely try. Thank you

I just set up a Coinbase Trader app on my phone last night with a limit order in at $275 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:17:16
Good advice. Thank you
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:30:51
Oh awesome. 
Do you know if I would be able to begin a recurring buy starting, say, today and cancel it tomorrow after my purchase of less than .1 BTC has gone through?
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:39:23
Didn't work :(
Got an email error message saying minimum is 0.10 BTC
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:18:11
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:32:34
There's a couple of things they have you do. Check on their website to be sure or Google "Coinbase instant BTC"
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:51:34
Thank you! I'm actually really excited about this 
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:24:56
I read two posts that seemed most relevant and neither of them had a fix. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:11:33
Just verified the exact spelling against my CC company and I input it with that spelling. It did nothing :(
Guess I'll be waiting 6-7 days for my BTC until they come up with a fix for it
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:34:16
Jesus, that's nearly 1,000$ USD list price for a PS4
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:59:40
Definitely. I got mine late but 5 minutes after I emailed them
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:19:47
Which in the end will mean good news for Bitcoin as its price will only continue to rise, correct?
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:57:42
They must have set a minimum very recently and quietly
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:29:53
All I can think of on this picture is how bitcoin is wearing its enemies skin
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:57:44
I wonder if purchasing bitcoins on Coinsetter via bank account will get you the BTC instantly. I hate that Coinbase only does it if you have a credit card tied to your account
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:50:53
Hm. So setting up a recurring buy for say $50 every week does sound like a good idea, I just feel that I might not feel it's "at a good enough price" and just cancel it before it goes through.
I will give it a shot though and set this up to see how I do.
Thank you! 
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:16:34
It's called Coinbase Trader. I was a little hesitant at first since it asks you to login to Coinbase so it can make purchases under your info, but since I move my BTC into cold storage right after I receive it I just went for it
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:57:03
Got it. Thanks a bunch good sir/maam
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:15:25
Ah ok. Well, I feel safer now
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:52:58
This is true. It is an investment and I truly believe it will be worth much more in the future, but maybe since this is my first investment I'm very much on the rookie side of it. So while waiting for a crash or steep drop might seem like a good idea to me, it's probably not
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:23:12
Just sent out an email. They're always on time except now. I hope this gets resolved ASAP
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:08:10
Ah, it all makes sense now. Thank you!
