I completely agree with you, but IIRC the IRS doesn't need warrants.   They can walk into your office and demand every receipt for every cup of coffee you purchased with a business credit card.

"If only my family bought gold when it was 10USD an ounce......" &lt;le sigh&gt;

I think that was kinda that idea here for many.

So.....purely out of curiousity (hai IRS) if someone had a wallet and, say, was pulling out cash from that wallet in BTC at a Bitcoin ATM.....that would be under the radar?

Or just forgot about $20 worth of fake internet money they couldn't do much with.  When I woke up and realized BTC was $6000 each I scrambled to get back into my old wallets and was very pleasantly surprised.  Suddenly interested in bitcoin again.

I think the small time stuff is not going to be an issue.  Rules are rules, but the IRS has never audited a garage sale.  I'd think of it that way maybe?
EDIT: has the IRS ever asked for individual eBay user data to see if anyone is selling grandpa's old baseball card collection at a gain?

I think its pretty obvious that this is a completely different animal than anything we've seen before.  Its not stock in Hewlett-Packard.  Its not a Yen.  Its nothing humanity has dealt with in the past.  Its entire history was supposed to be impossible.  
You can't make magic math money.  Can you?

Its that way in almost any state with a sales tax. I'm on a border and my state has no sales tax.  Anyone who crosses the border and buys a book at Barnes and Noble is technically supposed to pay sales tax on it to their home state.
