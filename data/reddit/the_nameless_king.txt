The return is the document you file.  A refund is only given if you overpaid.  
All rich people file returns, very few of them get refunds.  
For example, no one is asking to see trump's tax refunds.  They want to see his returns.

Depreciating currencies are extremely bad for the economy because no one lends.   Try getting a car or house loan when a currency is contracting.  It's impossible.  
That said, bitcoin is an amazing payment network.   Its essentially more capable than Western Union in getting money from A to B efficiently and it technically does so without having any paid employees.  
But, its a shit currency.  If you want to test that theory go try to buy a cup of coffee.  It will either take two hours to confirm or they won't accept it at all.

I'm just standing here on the street trying to sell my BTC.  Nothing is happening.  I must be doing it wrong. 
It's almost like I need electricity and internet access to complete any transaction with bitcoin.
With stock I can sell it online or call my broker to sel it.  I don't have to have internet or electricity to buy or sell stock.  I guess it's less versatile.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:32:47
Don't focus on the coffee then since it's too small for you to worry about, imagine a CAR purchase.
If you bought a car last week with 25BTC you would probably want to hang yourself right now.  By waiting one more week, you could've gotten twice the car, or paid half as much BTC for the same car.  That, is too volatile to be useful.... yet.... 
I bought a computer monitor from Newegg in mid 2013.  That monitor now shows up in my wallet as over $9000
 purchase as of this morning.... Look, I've learned what a deflationary currency can do to your mind when you hold it long enough.  As such, I'm holding it for probably 10 years minimum before I ever spend another satoshi.
The beauty of a distributed ledger is that you can see every single transation you've ever made... of course, this is also a curse, when the currency depreciates.

Haha, no.  That's like saying a Honda Accord is worth more than gold because it costs more than 1oz of gold.

Ask yourself, is one BTC worth more than one good delivery BAR of gold?  not even close....

The price can move $50 or more in the time it takes to confirm a coffee purchase. 
Edit:  To explain why this matters, let me give you two big reasons why people like you say, who "replenishing my bitcoin either before or at the same time as I'm making the purchase" are being a bit ridiculous.
1) If the price is moving like it has been (hundreds of dollars up and down in the space of a few hours), literally buying a $3 cup of coffee can cost $3.50 or $2.50 depending on when you buy it during the day.  I don't want to have to stress over my coffee purchase time based on what's happening with BTC pricing, I just want my fucking coffee.  I don't want to have to hedge or arbitrage every single transaction. By the time the transaction has actually been confirmed and you order your new bitcoins to "replenish" you could have gained or lost money just while standing at the counter.  That's incredibly stressful, not very useful.
2) The method you propose requires TWO transactions you have to wait for instead of one simple action of handing over cash to a hot barista for your cup of joe.  TODAY, if you use bitcoin to pay, you have to 1) scan and wait for confirmation while your coffee gets cold and 2) go onto an exchange and buy more bitcoins to "replenish".  This is literally twice the work and much LESS liquid than just handing a barista $3, the technology is supposed to be easier, not more difficult.
I'm a long term hodler of bitcoin (since late 2012, I actually bought a cup of coffee at a coffee shop in NC for .5BTC in January of 2013...yeah, over $1000 cup of coffee and getting more expensive daily), I've said for awhile that I will keep on hodling until I can buy a coffee seamlessly with BTC and not have to jump through extra hoops to get my caffeine fix.  The rest of you can keep using your coins however you wish and I'll freeload off of your network effect.  Cheers.

I think we agree on how to use bitcoin we just disagree on whether or not it makes sense today.  In my opinion, one day it will when volatility is all but gone... but after using it and every purchase feeling bad later I'm not at that point.  Every time the price rallies, I cringe at ALL of my previous purchases.  You are comfortable today knowing you could be spending a house worth of value on dinner, I'm just not there. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:46:07
I'd be happy to do that if the price wasn't so volatile day to day.  
I do it all the time with currencies when I travel abroad, never once have I woken up to find out my British pound has lost 10% of its purchasing power from yesterday's exchange.  
I'll just hodl and let you guys take the risk of buying in and out of the currency.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:02:22
Sorry, we're not communicating.  
I get exactly what you're saying, I'm just explaining to you why it's not realistic.  
It's not realistic because you're comparing the value of a fiat currency ($) to the PRICE of 1BTC, which isn't just a currency, but currency AND ownership in the network.  BTC is not solely a currency, it is a payment method network.  It is akin to stock in a privately held company where every accounting transaction is made publicly immediately.
Owning BTC is basically like being the CEO of Western Union, you have the ability to purchase things, but you also can control the network upon which they are purchased.
Even you yourself admit this by saying you'll replenish your ownership of the network after using it.


When you forego cash to buy something, you're trading currency for an item.  When you trade BTC for something, you're trading a FINITE share of a network AS WELL as a currency for that item.  That has meaning.  We can't print more dollars, BTC are finite, which means simply, as adoption increases, you will have to spend more dollars for the same BTC.
The value of the NETWORK is increasing as more people adopt it as a payment method (notice I didn't say as cash, but as a PAYMENT METHOD), 25BTC today is a lot more valuable than it was in 2012 because you can use it in a lot more places and it is more recognizable.  By contrast, cash today is a lot LESS valuable because of the amount of new dollars printed.
The reason for the price volatility is the network effect, and we are very early in the S-curve, so using your BTC is just like an owner selling Western Union stock BEFORE it went public.  Sure, you're welcome to do it, but FUTURE YOU will hate you for it.
Hodl.  You'll thank me, learn from my PAST SELF who hates the CURRENT SELF for spending BTC like you back in the day.

No, because gold is an an element, it cannot be copied.  It has tangible benefits only attributable to gold.  It can do certain things that other metals cannot do as well, therefore, they are not identical substitutes. 
Gold is not reliant on infrastructure to be gold, in fact, the worse the state of infrastructure (society/banking/etc), the higher the value of gold.  Bitcoin is the opposite, it requires electricity and a network, it requires acceptance and confirmation.  Gold is elemental and rare, hence it's value.
Another example, Silver is the best conductor of electricity, lead is a very poor conductor, trying to use lead instead of silver will not work effectively.  They are not substitutes. 
Bitcoin is a great method of payment, but a better method of payment could be designed and adopted.  It could also be cracked by quantum computing.  If someone could turn lead into gold, it would be worthless, alas, alchemists have been failing for 5000 years to accomplish this task, bitcoin doesn't have as much history.  Computing power is increasing, bitcoin is at risk.
I own both BTC and gold and I worry much less about gold ever going to zero than I do about BTC.

Sorry.  I would've replied sooner but I was waiting all night for a transaction to get confirmed and it used up all my data so my phone is running slow.

@_date: 2017-06-06 11:55:58
Haha, your own example proves you don't know history.  
Loans did exist before 1913, with interest rates above 25-30%.  The only people taking them were governments.  They were short term military loans, they were guaranteed with gold.  The people making the loans would literally hedge by loaning to both armies that were fighting with clauses that whoever won would pay back the loan plus interest from spoils.   The only way to pay back loans was to literally kill the other side and take their gold.  For example, the French banks loaned money to the Confederates and the Union during the civil war.  They knew one side would win, and their contracts made sure the other loan was hedged.  
There were no house loans, people paid with indentured servitude, that was literally the only "credit" for the common man.  If you wanted someone to pay your fare from England to America, you had to work for them... for years... before you were allowed to be free of your "debt"....  
Just imagine if you'd loaned your buddy $100 of bitcoin 5 years ago (10BTC).  He owes you $28000 now.  What's your recourse? It's not like you can just take the bitcoin back from him by force.  You'd learn from your mistake of loaning and never make another loan in bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is a great store of wealth, it is a terrible currency for a loan due to its deflationary nature. 
I gave a coworker 0.3 bitcoin in 2012 to show him how it worked so he could buy a cup of coffee with it, today that's about $900.  That's a mortgage payment for me.  I'll never make the same mistake again. 
If it's such a good currency for lending, why am I not getting emails everyday with companies looking to loan me bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:23:06
How about this, if you send me $20,000 today, I'll give you one year of my employment in 30 years.  In the year 2047, I'll work for you without any cost then since you've prepaid, whatever tasks you need, 
I'll be indentured to you from Jan 1 2047 to Dec 31 2047.  Deal?
Since dollars are so inflationary, you know that you'll never be able to afford a person that cheap in 2047. In fact, you'd be crazy not to accept the deal.
I'll PM you my transfer information when you accept.

Ok, so loan me 1BTC and I'll pay you 1BTC in 5 years.  In fact, I'll take 10BTC, go ahead and go trade $28,000 cash for BTC and send it to me, I'll pay you 10 BTC on June 6, 2022.
Of course, I might get hit by lightning or blown up at an Ariana Grande concert or something, but that's just the risk you take, right?

You aren't paid in bitcoin.  Nor will you ever be.  Because there's no bitcoin creation like with fiat.  Bitcoin is fixed, fiat is created to keep deflation at bey.

Consider a 30-year fixed rate mortgage on a home, the most common long-term debt in the USA.  
You as the borrower pay the same amount every month $1000.  This was a lot of money when you took out the loan in the year 2000, but in 2017, it's not too much money, thanks to inflation (inflation increases wages as well).  In fact, your mortgage payment goes down in REAL value every year, thanks to inflation, allowing you to build wealth in other ways.  What used to be 30% of your monthly take home, is now 15% because of inflationary price rises in your wages.
Banks want to get their money back so they need you to keep people interested in purchasing, in an inflationary world, people work and spend what they make rather than HODL, in a deflationary world, there is almost no demand for goods because people would rather HODL than buy anything.  
For example, why would you buy a car for $20,000 this year when it's going to be $15,000 next year for a newer, better car?  Deflation kills purchasing.  If no one buys the car, no one is needed to make the car, which kills jobs, which means the car builder can't pay for his house, which means he defaults causing the bank to become insolvent, which means the economy comes to a screeching halt.  All of this is avoidable with an inflating currency.
The whole reason everyone says HODL all over this sub is because they know it's deflationary.  No one is calling for people to SPEND their coins, because they know they can buy more with them next year.  Deflationary currencies like bitcoin and gold make excellent stores of wealth, but horrifically bad currencies.
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:42:27
Just Imagine if you'd taken out a loan in bitcoin 5 years ago from me to cover rent for a month. 
You asked for 100 BTC (at the time about $1000 total loan).  I loaned it to you with a fixed payback schedule of 10BTC per year. Because I'm a nice guy, I didn't even ask for interest.  
Enter deflation and the time value of a deflationary currency.  This year, due to deflation, your payment to me is the equivalent of $25000.
You will almost certainly default, or commit suicide because there's no way you'll ever be able to pay me back. 
On the other side of the transaction, I'm super pissed because I no longer have my bitcoin since I loaned it to you. I would be able to pay off my house with $280,000 in BTC but alas, I was stupid for loaning it out to someone who would never pay it back.  When you default or kill yourself, I'm fucked, so I'll probably kill myself. 
We both have been fucked by deflation.  That's why no one loans a deflationary currency.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:50:56
I've sold a couple houses.  The bank didn't "represent" anything. They wrote me a check which cleared.  They had to have that money in hand to make the loan.  Remember you aren't loaning a seller anything.  You're paying them.  
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:05:47
BTC is a deflationary currency, that's literally what it does, deflate.  It is the perfect deflationary currency, since it is decentralized.  I have a Masters in Economics, the world has never seen a perfect deflationary currency like BTC.
Every new person that learns about it deflates it, every dollar traded for BTC deflates it further, every coin lost on an old hard drive deflates it further... it can't be replicated or have more coins added, so it literally can only move in one direction... deflating...  The cost to mine them goes up, yet the production continues to fall, we know exactly how many will be found and when.   No surprise gold deposits or lakes of oil under some old farmland... Nope... perfectly exponential deflation.
Since it's such a good deal for you to loan, I wonder why you're not jumping at the chance?  It's almost like economically, you know loaning BTC is a terrible fucking idea.
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:30:48
And when I get a loan on a house for $100k and only pay $20k down I've just counterfeited $80k, right?  After all, I didn't have it, I went to someone else for it, who wrote a check.  All I did was agree to pay them at some point in the future. That is, it came out of thin air. 
Credit isn't counterfeit.

But alas, they aren't incentivized to save FOR THINGS. 
Look at the posts here, HODL HODL HODL... not for an item or future service, but because spending coins at ANY TIME in BTC's history would've been a long term mistake.  You don't want to be the 10,000BTC PIZZA guy, do you?
As such, the real message is NEVER SPEND YOUR COINS, YOU WILL REGRET IT.
If people aren't motivated to spend, the economy fails.  If goods and services aren't actively sought out, innovation goes away.  Why buy a car if it'll be "cheaper' next year as coins deflate.  Of course, now the car company goes out of business, putting people out of work who don't pay their mortgage.  Now that people aren't buying cars, TESLA goes out of business which means we don't get cool shit like solar roofing.

The US has had periods of both inflation and deflation... deflation was much worse from a human toll standpoint.  With a deflationary currency, you get things like indentured servitude as the only way to get a loan.
Inflation allows you to pay back money with interest knowing there will be a pool of money to choose from in the future.
With a deflationary currency, you (as a lender) know there will be less currency to go around in the future, so you won't lend what you have today because the chance of the borrower being able to pay it back gets smaller over time, instead of larger.  I could've paid back 10,000BTC easily 5 years ago... today, I've literally got no chance.  Why would anyone loan me BTC to buy a house?  
 
You (as a borrower) know that there will be less currency and that you'll have to work harder to pay back that loan in the future than you would today, so why would you take it?  I know I've got no chance to ever own 10,000 BTC again, even though at one time I had hundreds of them and thought nothing of it.... it's sickening.  Sure, if you offered me 1000BTC loan I'd take it.. with no intention of ever being able to pay it back....
Once you've been around the block a few more times, you'll see.... it's a great store of wealth, it makes for an absolute shit currency.

Why buy food today when it's going to be cheaper tomorrow?
Why sign up for a rental agreement when you know you could get a bigger apartment next year for the same price?  As a landlord, why would I rent you a 12-month lease today, when I know I'm going to have to charge you LESS next year, why wouldn't I just sell the property to you instead, then buy it back next year for less... why would I own...ANYTHING?  Why would you buy it from me?
People forego spending if they think it will be cheaper in the future, they only spend if they believe it will be more expensive in the future, which is why inflationary currencies work.  
The future you suggest is one in which people only spend money on things they need for literal survival, which frankly sounds pretty fucking terrible.  
Internet?  Don't need it, it will be cheaper next year.
Cell phone?  Don't need it, it will be cheaper next year.
Vacation?  Don't need it, it will be cheaper next year.
College?  Don't need it, it will be cheaper next year.

Sure, but loaning a guy $100 to have him walk and not pay you back and have no recourse to every get it back and seeing that $100 become worth $28,000 and keep on appreciating sounds pretty fucking terrible to me...
Hell, even having him give you $100 in cash today sounds pretty fucking terrible as well.... he'd literally have stolen $27,900 worth of gains from you... you'd want him dead.
At least with house loans and car loans, you'd have a house to take from them, but who is going to put up $28,000 of collateral on a $100 loan... that's the issue... it's a fucking TERRIBLE currency for loaning, and that hasn't changed since it's inception.... it's extremely deflationary... the only risk-off trade is HODL.....

BTC is a great store of wealth and information, however, it's a terrifyingly bad currency.
