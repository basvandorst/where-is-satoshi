No. Just no.
Everyone please DO NOT download this third-party 'Coinbase' App.
Wait for Coinbase to release an OFFICIAL app for iOS.

I agree with your well-thought-out theory except this part:
"Some genius who works for the US Government and smokes a lot of reefer finds out silk road is in the US. Pitches a grand idea to his higher ups "Hey, this site takes this shitty thing called Bitcoin. Let's nab the site creator and all his bitcoins. Dump a ton of money into it to jack the price up. Then auction off his BTC a year or so later. Then drop bombs of regulations on them bitcoinz
Take yo money and run."

Viacoin/ClearingHouse was the first recommendation that popped into my head after reading the post.
Looks like I was beaten to it...several times.

Sweep: Transfer the funds ONLY from one paper wallet to a wallet
Import: Transfers the funds AND private key of one paper wallet to a wallet
Sweeping is preferred, but as long as the private key of your imported paper wallet is never compromised, you'll be fine.

no because everyone knows aliens are behind Bitcoins.

Conversely, you could also be the sly fox who sold Bitcoin at $235 when it was actually $221. Just sayin.

What a misleading title.
Kim Dotcom is clearly referring to Blockchain technology..not specifically Bitcoin's blockchain.

because theyre looking at the yearly chart...making this 53% 'price rise' insignificant

Is this after accepting the new regulatory terms? Or is all my info already there since from the first time I verified my account identity over a year ago? 
Basically, am I 'safe' if I dont reverify my identity as its asking me to do now on the website? (i cant buy/sell bitcoin for now it says verification incomplete even though I was able to buy/sell no problems in the past)
