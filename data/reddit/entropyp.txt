It will be 2140 before all 21 million Bitcoins are in circulation. There are currently 10,800,000 Bitcoins in circulation. Times $30 and the market cap is roughly $300,000,000.
VISA/Mastercard spend about $200,000,000 *each year* on advertising alone. A $300,000,000 market cap amounts to peanuts.
If the Bitcoin market cap were $1,000,000,000 today, each Bitcoin would be worth about $80.  
If the Bitcoin market cap were $1,000,000,000 in 25 years*, each Bitcoin would be worth about $50.
If the Bitcoin market cap were $10,000,000,000 today, each Bitcoin would be worth about $800.  
If the Bitcoin market cap were $10,000,000,000 in 25 years, each Bitcoin would be worth about $500.
The market cap of Facebook is roughly $68,000,000,000.
Meaning ...
If a global financial system with censorship resistant properties is worth:
- SIX times less than Facebook **in 25 years**, the price of Bitcoin will be about $500.  
- SIXTY times less than Facebook in 25 years, the price of Bitcoin will be about $50.
- 120X less than Facebook in 25 years, the price of Bitcoin will still be about $25.
I repeat, we are comparing a global currency and financial system, aka the very fabric of a productive society, against fucking Farmville.
The market cap of Apple is roughly $430,000,000,000.  
If Bitcoin had just 10% of Apple's current market cap **in 25 years**, each Bitcoin would be worth over $2,000.  
And again, here we're comparing a global financial system to an iPod.
Very interesting times ahead.
Edit: in 25 years, 20 million coins will be circulating AFAIK, for all intents and purposes that's about as many coins as you'll see in your lifetime
