Stimulate conversations with OC. Not facts that everyone knows about btc.

I did this yesterday. Down 2k ����
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:38:13
No shit. Your acting like I haven’t been into coins for 5 years. Even if I just got in last week I would know it has no real value. 
P.s. you don’t have to reply to every post in the thread with your guru knowledge.

Check back in March.

My god it’s 9900... I shouldn’t have bought more yesterday. I thought we hit the wall at 11k -_-
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:24:16
I hope today it doesn’t get down to 8
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:00:52
Maybe to someone who is a first time reader... Try searching in this sub how many people have said “bitcoin holds no real value”. Now try posting something of value that hasn’t been said in 100000 other threads.

Go back to WSB you pleb.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:24:39
Naw if we got them a while ago we would have all sold at 1700
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:47
I don’t understand why everyone is mad! I’m happy I got my fork coins!!!
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:29:51
Ur such a fucking pleb
@_date: 2018-03-29 06:09:07
Haha yes. Once the alien cyborgs take over the earth and L. Ron Hubbard returns BTC will be a universal currency worth 1m ea. But only after all the noobs sell and one person controls it all.

Quarterly taxes would be April first no?

2 people with 2 jobs need 2 cars... and with no credit and I get a discount for Paying a year up front. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:52:42
Lol pussy is temporary. Btc is forever ❤️
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:36:16
Hmmm maybe your right. Fuck I could just get 2 Honda’s for 1k each... and I guess double the deposit would fix the credit issue. The thing is that my income is fucked on the books also. Looks like i hardly make enough for a $2000 per month apartment. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:01:23
I have 7btc right now. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:33:59
Hmmm the appreciation of btc in the last 4 months hasn’t been impressive. Since I’ve been in it I have seen a dip last this long. Last one was what? 45 days? It’s been 90 days and it’s still fucked
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:32:45
Because the jobs we have we are required to both be mobile at the same time. Unable to share. She does have some money, like 4K lol. And she holding like $1000 in btc also. She bought in during the hype when I told her not to. Plus I promised her I would buy her a car after this last year of hell I put her through. Not to mention in the last 3 days I completely destroyed her current ride driving it from state to state. Had to abandon it in the middle of AZ as I blew a head on it and it got all fucked. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:00:22
I get a discount if I pay up front. Plus no credit rn.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:55:16
I need more info
@_date: 2018-03-25 07:00:38
Yes sir. I am definitely rethinking the situation
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:28:49
Bahaha I try to justify it this way. If I was single I would be visiting rubmaps.com 2x+ a week, which is $150 a visit. $1200 a month on Asians or a cute white girl at probably the same amount that puts out more and does chores. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 11:28:03
Buy gold online for btc then sell irl
@_date: 2018-03-25 04:02:58
Ya by July it should be 12+. I just can’t wait
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:31:41
Yes! Sell everything you own and move to a small village in Japan and harvest rice. You will realize that hot sticky rice buns are the reason you came into existence. Then go to a monk momentary and devote your life to the ways of garlic bread. Cheers.
