The government tells you there is "No inflation", so you believe them? the biggest crooks of them all?
But actually, healthcare and education are skyrocketing, but those are not counted, why?The inflation has been hidden from you, how? Well according to [wolfstreet.com](
"These are the good times, but why are subprime credit cards, auto loans, and short term installment loans blowing out?""Ok we've got a situation in subprime consumer loans. The delinquency rate on credit-card loan balances at the nearly 5,000 smaller commercial banks in the United States - this means all banks except the largest 100 - is blowing out,  according to Federal Reserv data. In the third quarter, the delinquency rate at these banks rose to 6.25%. That's higher even than during the peak of the Financial Crisis"
The subprime loan data has been removed due to Hedonic Adjustments (as well as Healthcare and Education) meaning the government ha cut this from their inflation reports. Those reports are then accepted and distributed by CNBC, The Wallstreet Journal and Financial Times etc.  While the inflation actually is 8% - 9% or even higher...
Since you believe in your government, feel free to ignore certain evidence and accept serfdom.

Adam Smith did not...  
Civil disobedience comes in some forms, they are non violent and has been classified by Ronald Dworkin as such:   










(copied from wikipedia due to laziness)  
Since I feel that bank loans and the entire Fiat system is immoral then refusing to pay them back is a way of civil disobedience.  
I break the "law" and will not pay them back because I feel that the system is dangerously wrong.  
This is about not accepting a system that steals from you... If you agree or not is up to you, but I will not pay my loans and taxes and I accept any punishment for doing so.

@_date: 2019-12-23 11:59:24
I have told my mother what bitcoin is, yes. That is because she is also in debt.  
I am not sure you understand the system behind fiat. Currently, we the people are being robbed. This is done with loans and debt. Your 20$ bill was created by paper, its value is just that of paper, nothing else. The government behind that 20$ bill sets the value and if we do not agree, they will go to war over it. 1971 Nixon removed the gold standard, which lead to free printing of paper money. The more of something the less of the value it has.  
Wealth today is being stolen by cheap paper money, land, gold and other resources ar being bought. This while we pay for healthcare that gets increasingly more expensive. student loans, mortgages soar and places you and I in debt. On top of this you have an income tax. The whole system is to keep you in bondage.  
That is because you are not in control of this system, you are not printing the money. The one who does makes his friends and their children, politicians, bankers, and corporations richer.   
This while your wages remain the same.
Therefore it is an obligation to not pay tax, to not pay you loans, because if you do, you support a system that is broken and infected.  
Educate yourself and start using bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-23 22:04:32
You are wrong.  
It used to be like that before 1971, when the gold standard was removed. It used to be that way before free money printing. It used to be that way before fractional reserve banking. However the days of Jessie James are long gone.
If you save money in a bank, you are an idiot because you rely on a flawed banking system.  First the interest on your savings are not high enough to match the currency inflation. Also they will charge you a fee to have an account. Your savings will also be gone when the banks collapse.
Some actually are forced to take loans. Healthcare and education is not cheap unless you live in a socialist country like Denmark, then its free. So the reality for the common man is usually debt.  
Stealing your safe... your reasoning is... flawed
@_date: 2019-04-26 11:24:41
... well only because of a deal made with them oil producing countries to only accept dollar for oil, hence it is also called 'petrodollar'. If this did not happen, the dollar would be much weaker. Specially since the gold standard was abolished by them 'special people' that now control us.   
... and destroyed is a bit... wrong since we are still here.
@_date: 2019-04-20 23:50:28
Okay...  
For instance Venezuela is an OPEC country and they are being bullied by the US. (dollar issues)

Fine, I did not give you credit for the point you made regarding the asset hedges. Frankly because I found it stupid. Why, you may ask. So I will indulge you but first can we agree that, when you are born, you have nothing and in fact, until you start your first job, you are a cost for your parents.
I propose that you might not have an entry position in any company that pays well, lets suggest an average salary working an assembly line. Not everyone is a doctor or work for google, but you get a little Christmas bonus.
All this is fine, if you live with your parents. But you want to move to your own place, preferably in a "safe" area. This means either renting a place or buying one. If you rent you lose half, if not more of your pay check or you get a mortgage, which also would cost you half if not more of your pay check each month. Now add in living expenses, car, insurance etc... You quickly realise that you might only have 200$ to save if not less after your expenses. How much real estate, equities, commodities can you get for this? Hence I found that this point was  stupid. We should also remember that the market is bloated, real estate prices are increasing so even if you have saved a year and now have 2400$, you are still far from able to get said assets.
On the other hand, government assets are also being sold to private investors. The billionaries know that land, gold, etc are good assets to own when the system fails, and they can afford it. Most of us are not billionaires but debt slaves.

So, the Dollar is also called the "Petrodollar" since the rule used to be that petrol could only be bought with "dollar".
Hypothesis : Would the process of debt be sped up if petrol could be bought with Bitcoin? due to the dollar losing its position?
Hypothesis : Would not the Saudies or UAE or any OPEC country really benefit if they change from the "petrodollar"? - Mainly due to creation of money(dollar) vs finite oil
For instance Venezuela is in a pickle due to the US embargo/conflict. Venezuela is an OPEC country. It is mentioned often that Venezuelans are turning to Bitcoin. If I am not mistaken they tried to issue their own crypto, which they seemed to have botched. If they had accepted Bitcoin, maybe the situation there would be better.
In regards to the FED, they are worried about these things as could be seen in Libya where Gadaffi wanted to issue an African "gold standard" currency. This would have undermined the value of the dollar. We also know what happened to him. It also seems as Venezuelas leader is next.
In addition, we can see of the latest veto from president Trump in regards to the Yemen war, that he is running a smooth business. The business is War and materiel is being sold to the Studies, for oil or dollar, which in essence is oil. The reason was the recent statement that the Saudies threatened with pulling out of OPEC. This could not be accepted and a rumour that nuclear plans/weapons were sold has risen.
Meanwhile in Turkey, they have stopped buying from US and went Russian instead on their materiel and thus the US now want to throw them under the bus. Turkey was also blamed for working with an organisation to smuggle oil recently, but this could be a rumour.
So, if the business is War, Oil and Dollar. It makes sense to undermine anything and or anyone that goes against the established power to be. Thus, to solve many of these conflicts my Hypothesis gives food for thought.  
Edited Adendum: I have been reading lately that China, Russia and others ar buying Gold? Could someone explain as to why and is it related??
@_date: 2019-12-31 15:23:50

So an all time high says nothing.. there is 30 million people in Venezuela. Remove old, young and non tech savvy people. Remove those without electricity and/or means to access the internet. And then you get an idea that the Venezuelans might have, maybe heard of Bitcoin. Lets say that a few could or can buy bitcoin as well as have the means to use it.  
So if there are 100 people able to trade it out of 30 million, and it increase to 150 people, you have hit an "all time high" ... so keep this in mind when posting these links.
