The genesis coinbase is untouchable. The subsequently mined coins are not, and they may have been mined by "satoshi"
Anyone mining in the first few years could mine a lot, no problem. I remember having a P4 that could mine about 0.1 BTC a day by itself. Any state-actors who may have been involved at the time and did not sell their mined coins will be very rich now.

It's very possible the CIA recognizes the drawbacks of fiat currencies and created Bitcoin with the properties that it has intentionally.
While they lose the edge they have over total control of the ecosystem, that's what is required to build such a system. The benefit to them is that *when* bitcoin becomes the world reserve currency, they will have a LOT of it, possibly making the US government the wealthiest entity on the planet, by a large margin. 
If this is the case though, you won't hear about it until long after Bitcoin is the standard or the network completely dies.

When I bought my first bitcoin, I had to transfer money to an exchange where I would buy Linden Dollars (Money for the Second Life game), and then could sell the Linden Dollars for bitcoin. It was a weird process, but it worked. There was nothing close to what something like Coinbase is today (Maybe Mt.Gox? Bit of a stretch) but the market found a way for the buyers to get what they wanted.
Bitcoin survived before regulation and it will survive the inevitable attempts to regulate it. That's the whole appeal anyways.

Anything that's bigger, they deal with my actual company (They get an invoice, it goes on the books, etc). My company does offer a 5% discount for paying with BTC and we are totally fine with that. 
I don't consider it a loss. I don't worry about the BTC to USD rate.

Actually, in the leaked NSA documents, Tor was a source of great frustration for them because they CAN'T crack the encryption. They have ways to detect certain users, but it's more of a hit/miss solution rather than actually being able to tell who they are. Anyone using Tor properly is truly untraceable.

Obviously they don't mix for instantaneous transactions. It makes sense if you were a buyer paying with credit card to get BTC because you could charge back and walk away with cold hard cash.

I still can't wrap my head around the market for this. 
Anyone who's technically savvy enough to set this thing up is technically savvy enough to go buy their own RPi and set it up at 1/5th the cost. It's not effective as a miner, so obviously it's geared towards developers however developers tend to be smart people who can just download the blockchain themselves. Bitcoin is already dead simple to develop on top of, so this doesn't really provide anything new in that layer. 
Seriously, anyone dropping $300 on this would be better off buying an Intel NUC, installing Ubuntu server and hooking it up to a broadband connection for a day while the blockchain syncs.

It has nothing to do with Ethereum, just some jackasses who want to pump their margins.

They won't is the answer. Even the current election system isn't *truly* anonymous. If you have some "god-level" access to all the election systems, it wouldn't be hard to know who voted for who. 
There's a tradeoff between anonymity and authorization. If you only want an auditable, limited set of users to vote in your system, it will require a centralized registration point and that kills anonymity.

Yes. This is why gold has value attributed to it. It's unique. It's generally unforgable. These properties make it generally "easy" to assess it's value in the context of everything else. 
This is less of a bitcoin topic though, more of just a "what is money" sort of question.

Bitcoin gives you all of the above properties, and then some. 
It's more portable than paper money and more naturally limited than gold. It doesn't have any of the counterfeiting issues of paper money. It is not reliant on any institution/organization to continue operating. All money has value because of "social perception", but that perception is often rooted in real reasonings (Such as scarcity). 
Unless you're talking about a moneyless world, we need money, bitcoin is very much about rejecting fiat money. If you want to reject fiat money, you need an alternative, and that is bitcoin.

*Trust* is a fundamental problem in computer science. The revolution of the blockchain is that we can eliminate this trust, the tradeoff of this system is that we need proof of work. That's why we "waste" energy. 
The wasted energy is fundamental to healthy network operation. If you want a system that is trustless, you need something that you can rely on without trust (i.e. The laws of mathematics).

You are absolutely correct. Your history with bitcoin is not dissimilar to my own.

I consider my bitcoin to be 100% a bet that the central banks *will* fail. I hold it for the exact same reasons that many people hold gold. I spend bitcoin, because it's an easy, secure way to send money without dealing with all sorts of red tape. 
The old rules of money don't apply to Bitcoin because Bitcoin doesn't play by those rules. It won't play by those rules. If you don't see how bitcoin can easily replace both gold and fiat currencies and how it offers all the advantages and lacks the disadvantages of both, you must have misheard something in Bitcoin 101. 
The supply and demand of fiat currencies is based on the trading power of nations. We came up with this system because it's more flexible than gold, but it requires centralization (of varying degrees). This causes money and trade to get caught up in all sorts of political and social quarrels. It requires there be a trust between nations for their currency to be "good".
Bitcoin eliminates that requirement of trust. It's not a debt-based system, it's a real money system that give us the positive properties of a gold-based currency but with the elasticity and portability of fiat moneys.

Credit card transactions are a pull mechanism. They need MORE security. There's no problem at all transmitting a bitcoin transaction over an insecure network. Major problems doing that with a credit card.
And the good thing about cryptography is that we can change the algorithms without breaking the protocol. Unless someone develops a 0-day quantum computer (In which case, we've got bigger problems anyways), tech that can break today's encryption doesn't mean it can break tomorrow's encryption. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:02:17
A bug/exploit of that sort would likely be with an underlying technology of Bitcoin (Such as an exploit in asymmetric key algorithms) rather than Bitcoin itself. 
While you're right about that possibility making bitcoin worthless, if such a scenario happened we would instantly be able to exploit much larger systems (Government classified materials, encrypted data transmissions, etc). 
Regardless of bitcoin's status at that point, the world would be fundamentally changed forever (assuming we survive). Bitcoin would be among the least of your concerns at that point.

Some quick things:
1. Bitcoin is a technical protocol spec. It does not have any motives or intentions other than what it's users project onto it.
2. Bitcoin offers a way for me to store my wealth independent of any state/entity. I don't have to have faith that the US government will be around tomorrow to back my purchase, my bitcoin is going to be there regardless. I don't want to trust anyone I don't have to.
3. Bitcoin is limited (to a precise known quantity). Bitcoin is not going to degrade during long-term storage. Bitcoin can be easily sent to any one in the world with no intermediaries. Bitcoin is easy to store.
I have bitcoin because it is what I think fair money looks like. It is how money should work. I want to transact with someone on the other side of the planet as easily and readily as I can talk to them. I do not want to rely on my country's (Or, even worse, another country's) government to back up my wealth. I do not want my money to be tied to any sort of political/economic pressures.
Plenty of people/entities share these ideas and will see that Bitcoin is the only system that provides all of these properties. That makes it *invaluable*. Bitcoin is gold for the post-physical era.

You mistake bitcoin for being a product, like aluminum foil who's value is determined essentially by cost of production plus a profit percentage.
Bitcoin may work like that now, but that's why coins are still &lt;$100,000 each. Bitcoin's service isn't wasting electricity, that'd be a stupid product. Bitcoin offers us a way to have money independent of any state. It allows for wealth to be preserved and exist independently of any country, organization or other fallible/mortal entity.
The electricity waste is merely a way to safeguard the network against malicious actors. The bitcoin network spends so much power that even major nation-states would have a tough time catching up (independently) to a significant market share. This prevents any *one* from controlling it, which is a benefit for pretty much anyone/anything that uses money, except the people who make "money".

Bitcoin isn't about the technology, it's about the blockchain. 
EDIT - The downvotes either mean you're all dumb or you misread. I frequently hear people these days say "bitcoin doesn't matter. It's all about blockchain". That's not what I'm saying. That's a stupid thing to say. 
Bitcoin matters because of ***it's*** blockchain. The technology/protocol spec that is verifying current blocks is irrelevant, and we can swap it out whenever/however we want. Newer blocks can have whatever data we want in them. Bitcoin matters because it's blockchain provides an immutable ledger, regardless of the technology on top.
So, I will say it again: Bitcoin isn't about the technology. It's about the blockchain.

afaik, the satellites are read-only, but that's fine. The blockchain needs a lot of bandwidth to download and satellites make sense for that.

People using these systems probably have other ways to broadcast to the Bitcoin network. This is not something intended for "average" users. This is some of the first steps towards a "meshnet" type of communication system for Bitcoin. 
In the event of a major Internet outage event, If I can download the blockchain from space, but then broadcast my transactions out through some alternative means (Shortwave radio, LAN&lt;-&gt;LAN networks, sneakernet, etc), then I can effectively use Bitcoin without the internet.
The real appeal of this technology, when implemented at scale, would be to have connected "hubs" such as a small village community center. Not everyone would need to have a satellite, but the community center could have a satellite connection and it could broadcast that information over some local wifi or something. 
Remember, a key point of Bitcoin is that Bitcoin has no opinions about how a message gets relayed to it. It's ultimately just a box of "unsorted mail" and then we all do some math on our computers to sort that mail into a data structure (i.e. The "blockchain").
To use Bitcoin, you need to be able to download the blockchain, you need to be able to get stuff into that "unsorted mail" pile. That's it. These things do not need to happen on the same connection or even remotely the same way. 
Sending a Bitcoin transaction in the future might be akin to writing your transaction down on a piece of paper and just "throwing it to the wind" and assuming that someone, somewhere will pick up that note and relay it to the network.
