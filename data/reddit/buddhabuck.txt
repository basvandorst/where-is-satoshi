Using the analogy, the ledger-writers are trying to write individual pages in the ledger-book, each page holding a collection of transactions. Each page has a unique ID at the top, a line that reads "Continued from page ____" which has the ID of the previous page, a special hash nonce, and one of the transactions is "Ledger-writing fee: 25 BitCoin to MinerBob".
When that page is copied and sent out, everyone can check out the information: Is the previous page in their ledger books? Does another page in the ledger books reference the "previous" page (not necessarily a bad thing)? Is it properly signed? Do any of the transactions on the page already exist in the ledger books? Do all the transactions on the page validate? Does the hash nonce solve the mining problem? And is the 25 BitCoin ledger-writing fee reasonable?
If it doesn't check out, the page can simply be dropped and ignored. Another candidate page with the legitimate transactions will come along soon, and can be included in the ledger books. That one, however, will have "Ledger-fee: 25 BitCoins to MinerJane" instead.
The system is set up so that a new ledger-page is written in a verifiable way approximately every 10 minutes, even though a lot of ledger-writers are trying to write ledger-pages. Associated with each page is a mining problem that depends on all the data on the ledger-page, including the special nonce I mentioned above. A hash of all the data on the ledger page (including the nonce) has to meet certain conditions (which can vary over time) in order for the page to be valid. Most of the work of ledger-page writing goes into finding a nonce that makes the hash valid. This proves that the ledger-writer did some work to write the ledger-page.
