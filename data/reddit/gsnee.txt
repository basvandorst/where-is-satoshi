You can buy with no fees on GDAX.

GDAX is Coinbase.

My theory: people don't fully trust it yet...
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:03:32
I'd say that's perfect. Thanks!

Well, that makes sense. So how does the price fluctuate. Maybe that's what I don't understand...

I just don't have the money. I got my self in some debt that I'm trying to get out of now. I did once buy a small amount of BTC but sold it about a week later because I needed the cash. I'm just not financially stable to be able to "afford" a loss of money if the market were to disappear. But, I can see the finish line of debt and the starting line of BTC!

Is unstable a way to explain it?

Sweet. Thanks.

Same thing happened to me from GDAX to my offline wallet. The transaction is just pending and will be for a few days since they were having problems the past 2 days. It'll show back up either in your coinbase wallet or your gdax wallets(??)

Also, what is a good site to view the exchange rate for BTC to USD?

As for mining, why won't it be profitable? That's one of the things that I'm having a hard time figuring out. And for verifying transactions, is it just bitcoin transactions? Or all transactions over the net?

I think at this point I need the advanced. answered my questions pretty well so maybe you could expand on those a little?

Here's how I look at it. The value of currency fluctuates constantly, no matter what currency you use. So would the customer expect more money if the value of that currency dropped? Probably not. So why give them more BTC just because the value dropped? Just MHO. I think you did the right thing by returning the same amount of BTC.

Sorry for the possibly dumb questions, but since the mining is so hard to get into, will it eventually drop since more people aren't seeing the ROI?
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:47:54
Awesome thanks!

I definitely like your projections. I'm pretty new to bitcoins and after researching a bit, it is almost nearly impossible to predict difficulty. You may be close, but i was reading a prediction from the beginning of this year and said that the difficulty would only be at 2 million instead of what is today at 908,350,862. On the other hand, just 3 months ago someone predicted the difficulty at 1.5 billion. 600 million over what it actually is. So who knows....
