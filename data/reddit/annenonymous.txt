I didn't recommend a response. 
My general feeling about this is that journalism/media has huge amount of power and it uses it many times in unethical ways. This is a huge problem, and we should fight to fix that. In thas context, maybe doxing a reporter is the lesser of two evils.

fuck that. Newsweek author uses journalism to do something potentially very irresponsible.if there isn't some price to that(no death threats, but something), future journalists will use their power in the same irresponsible manner. 


It does matter that journalists(and porfessionals) behave ethically, and the excuse "it will happen anyway" is a lousy one.

With all due respect "giving people what they want" at the cost of exposing nakamoto and his family to potential crime doesn't seem like a good tradeoff. And she could have solved the mistery in general terms without exposing his name and family.


Again: what real journalistic value exposing him and his family to those risks had?  it's onlyh about peeping into other people's lives , and journalism shouldn't be about that.

It's one  role of society to moderate/channel negative human impulses.

This looks interesting. Does anybody know some revenue models from the point of view of the user?

Bips, that's an interesting project. Do you might know a revenue model from the user side for a bitcoin ap?
