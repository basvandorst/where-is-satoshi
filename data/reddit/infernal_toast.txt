If you want to test it, just make an EIP918 pure mined token smart contract with difficulty that adjusts that way (using Solidity) and launch it on Ethereum ropsten or mainnet network using the many soliditySha3 open source miners and try to mine it.  
I see your approach to just twiddling knobs , especially since there already are halvenings which is basically what you described but only they are dependant on the supply mined not hashrate.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:11:06
Most RC20 tokens as they stand today yes.  However OP is envisioning a future world where owning a token does give you dividends, voting rights, and literally ownership in a real company or something else.  Anything else really .  This is entirely possible but there are some legal and political hoops to jump through .  This is the way the world is going and it is more logical than storing all of that ownership in a centralized database - that is for sure

Yes exactly.  Technically, all energy is 'wasted' depending on the individuals viewpoint.  Luckily energy is constantly beaming at us from the sun and being collected as heat and as energy by plants and now by solar panels.   Bitcoin isn't 'wasting' energy because it is actually performing an extremely useful service to millions of people.  Humans are corrupt and can't be trusted and Bitcoin solves that better than any system before it.     Since cars are also providing a useful service to millions they are not wasting energy either.

Typically forks have been attacks yes but in general, forks are a necessary and natural part of Decentralized consensus.   Just remember that the fork-end with the most work put into it is the TRUE variant according to Satoshi.  Therefore BTC is the real 'bitcoin.'

Could this go a step further and allow software merchants to check the block chain for transactions to them from that public key?  This could then use the blockchain like a licensing server.

Layers can be built on bitcoin to make it seamlessly easy for the layman to use.  Patches can be pushed to fix flaws in the current version.  Why throw away the current blockchain to start a new one?  There is nothing wrong with it.  Who is to say that this new "bitcoin 2.0" won't use the current blockchain and just fork off of it?  Anyone who is vested in the current ledger will be very reluctant to just throw all of that away.  
If you had to work low-level with our current credit card system and copy/paste a bunch of account numbers to transfer money, it would be just as difficult.  Once there is a layer for bitcoin that is as easy as a credit card, your arguments become less valid.  This tech is just in its infancy though, it took many years for credit card technology to develop on top of the dollar.

Even if bitcoin was banned, it wouldn't die.  Not by a long shot.  Black market exchanges would pop up, an underground community would develop, and even if the price went down you could still launder large sums of coin over borders just as easily as one can today.  Also, the protocol could be forked to an extent that it fit through a loophole in the legislation.  These people are pretty naive.  They need to update their laws to modern technology instead of trying to stifle innovation with litigation from the Dark Ages.  They could be trying to snuff out a golden age.

indeed we will see.  Other chains are switching to proof of stake because they see the writing on the wall.
Fact is, it costs a LOT of money to secure a chain with PoW.  Millions of dollars per day.  That can come from either inflation or from tx fees but it needs to come from somewhere.   Saying that this is not true is scientifically wrong. 
However I will also say that its not that big of a deal because 51% attacks are not a deal breaker, we will always have btc historic chaindata, and forks can be used to upgrade the network.  It will be OK, im just pointing out that this train may have to switch tracks a bit because it might be headed into a wall.   Software is adaptive when it needs to be.  Im not against BTC i love BTC, i just point out possible  issues when i see them for the GOOD of the system.  You cant cure what you dont diagnose

Btc transactions are few and far between , limited at 7 per second and that will likely never increase.  They are special and will be only  for humanity's most important trustless transactions.  Lightning and other technologies allow for much greater efficiency.  
Not only that, but mining does not directly pollute at all (unlike refining gold or driving cars or livestock.) Mining only consumes some energy , and the way you procure this energy is the REAL problem.  Let's talk about making energy in clean and renewable ways.

Bitcoins ruleset is a Centralized set of rules though and everyone agrees on them ��
Did you decide to implement segwit? No a centralized group did.  Imo that's even kind of worse because the rules can change. With a smart contract the rules can never ever change . It's better.  
BTC is always number 1 crypto. I'm just talking about different tech that's mildly interesting

I'm talking about a smart contract owned by nobody facilitating atomic swaps of currency.  It's actually decentralized dude and there are hundreds of them.  No you cannot use actual BTC with it (a huge negative for BTC right now) but you can use other pure mined currency with them.  Specifically pure mined PoW erc20 tokens. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 04:35:17
In case someone here is new... that WILL NEVER work.  Lets see why.  
Fiat is totally FUNGIBLE with reserve-fiat made by banks.  We cant tell the difference between real fiat and reserve-fiat, so its all the same and equal.  
However, it is impossible that any other token or coin or currency EVER be totally fungible with BTC.   It is just not possible.   We wil always be able to tell that it is not BTC, but some cheap made up piece of garbage.  'Reserve BTC' (lmao)  will always be  easily distinguishable from the real thing and therefore cannot exist, it will be priced at 0.  
@_date: 2018-10-22 19:54:49
Don't be so salty.  I am atomically swapping pure mined currency in arbitrary ethereum smart contracts that are deployed in agreement with the counterparty.   You are trading pure mined currency on Centralized Exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.  It's okay it's just the way it is :) 
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:51:50
A smart contract with no owner is not Centralized. It's a trustless software program in the Ethereum network.  There is no centralized control, and in the case of a pure mined token, all of the tokens have to be minted using PoW there are none given to a monarch or deployer.  You don't know what you are talking about.  Read EIP 918 and get back with some real criticism.   After you do, you'll realize that now it's possible to trade pure mined cryptos on a truly decentralized DEX contract, atomically, like etherdelta and forkdelta.  This is not a matter of opinion it's a fact.
I hope one day we can trade BTC on a Dex too but right now it's restricted to centralized platforms only. :(

The brand for monster energy drink is worth over 20 billion...... that's a single soft drink company....

@_date: 2018-10-22 18:08:03
Right but the central authority is a non-owned permissionless smart contract that no human has any control of.  Oh and you can agree to select whatever contract you want or the parties can even deploy their own contract they agree upon , like a copy of the forkdelta exchange source code.. Solidity.    I have done this myself.   
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:12:21
Well with some medium-grade programming skills I'm sure you can figure it out. Any language will work, python JavaScript whatever. You need to download the entire blockchain and write a function that will query the balance of an address and make sure it is very quick.
  Then you need a function that will convert a private key to a public key .. use a standard library for this.  Then you need to write an infinite loop that tries tons of private keys (similar to yours ). It tries them by generating the address for that key, looking up the balance , and breaks out of the loop if one has more than 0 Bitcoin on it.  It would then print out the private key and address also.

Right now, tx fees on bitcoin amount to $140,000 per day, while the block reward (inflation) amounts to $7.2 million per day.  Tht means that tx fees are 2% of the total security incentive, and security is directly and linearly coorelated to the security incentive.   Therefore what I am saying is true.   Its not speculative its math.  
144 blocks per day * $4000 * 12.5 btc per block = 7.2m .
in a few decades, that 12.5 btc per block becomes less than 1 btc per block.   There is no reason at all to suspect TX fee revenue will increase.  What do you think

I agree with all of that too.   I agree premines and dev rewards are bullshit and should never happen.  I agree everything should be pure mined.   None of that invalidates my argument though.  Now we have determined that both PoW and PoS have issues.

It won't replace the Dollar, it will do what gold does but in a much better way. Bitcoin is already here. It's already real. People are using it to pay for goods and services, to send money to their families, and to store their wealth.  It's a tool and it is a success.  Use it if you want. Also I totally think it will crash to $2500 or lower in the future.  But it is also the perfect world currency and the first currency humanity has had which is owned democratically rather than by totalitarianism.

Bitcoin has more proof of work put into it, Bitcoin cash is the 'fork' with less proof of work put into it.  Therefore by the definition in the Satoshi whitepaper, the fork with the lesser amount of work put in it is the failed fork and the true mainnet as a continuation of the genesis block is Bitcoin.

I don't have time to help you.  But I will say that if you think the Dollar has retained it's value over the last 8 years you are a fool.  The cost of housing has doubled.  The cost of tuition has doubled. The price of stocks has doubled. The price of healthcare has doubled. The price of crypto has more than doubled.  So you tell me.  Has the price of all those things doubled or does your precious Dollar have half as much spending power?  Peculiar predicament you are in there.  Wake up because there is a centralized organization printing dollars.  Do you know how much they are printing?  What if it is a lot?  Hm.

Well obviously token projects with a centralized owner/deployer would never make good currencies like bitcoin.

The problemo is, as you add more and more miners, the difficulty (nonce) automatically increases to keep the block time around 10 minutes.  So adding more miners won't get you increased throughput, it just makes the network more secure so it is harder to attack.  That is why we are stuck at no more than 7 tx per second or so.  Certainly you could make the difficulty easier so blocktimes were shorter than 10 minutes, some other coins do this.  Certainly you could fit more transactions in a block but that is what we fight so hard against because it promotes centralization (Segwit2x).  The only good secure way to scale a blockchain is either sharding, or, similarly, sidechains.  As far as we can all discern.

Bitcoin is more 'living' than most biological viruses.  Not only it is a set of replicating data, it has processes that it carries out.  It also feeds on massive amounts of energy.

@_date: 2017-10-16 18:06:29
They are quite similar but Bitcoin has some clear advantages.  Digital Fiat account balances are fragmented; each bank stores it's own record of your balance which they control.  They can seize your funds or prevent you from access.  The Bitcoin records are in a single shared database and decentralized (like a Torrent) so nobody has control over them.  You can always access your funds as long as you know your 'secret passphrase' (private key).  Furthermore, the total supply of Bitcoin is fixed at no more than 21 million coins. (  You can have a fraction of a Bitcoin though.  )  Digital fiat can be infinitely printed by the treasury and so its spending power drops dramatically through each generation ; a hot dog used to be 5 cents now it is $5.  
Certainly Bitcoin is not very easy to use (right now) due to the need to fiddle with cryptographic keys but it will be built into the backend of many services once scalability is improved.  Blockchain technology is revolutionary and it requires a form of valuable currency to work.  Anyone saying they are 'implementing blockchain' without Bitcoin/another major coin will find the following: 
1. Their block chain is centralized and therefore would be better off being a traditional centralized server or
2. Their decentralized blockchain is very vulnerable to attack because their mining power is so weak/incentives are not in place

Well bitcoin is a 'push' system while credit cards are a 'pull' system.

Multi-sig, if properly applied, will help a lot to prevent stolen private keys.  Credit card numbers are not even multi-sig today!  Also, services can be built that provide you with a second- or third-opinion on whether or not that address you are about to send your coins to is a fake or the real deal.  This is no joke.. we are seeing the failures of credit cards as technology and the internet become more sophisticated and bitcoin has a lot of potential to solve these security problems.

Gpu mining is one of the best ways to promote decentralization, the whole point of crypto.  Unless you think every average Joe is going to buy an S9. Before ASICs Bitcoin hashrates were very spread out globally.  Now, not so much.

Supply and Demand. Maybe someone will start a new company manufacturing GPUs to help keep up with the demand.  Its simple capitalism.  New tech makes new demand.

Yes this is all true. It was also all true when everyone was posting memes of the dog drinking coffee with the house on fire, the roller coaster dropping, and everyone spelling doomsday as we fell to $2k.  It will remain true the next time Bitcoin crashes.  Cryptocurrency as a technology has and will continue to have massive implications. It is extremely empowering to the human race and thus will be extremely ~valuable~ to the human race.  For the most part as soon as someone 'gets it' they believe the same thing.  Have you met someone who understands cryptocurrency and how it fits into computer science who also doesn't believe in it?

Oh yeah that's certainly the easiest way to acquire them too

Tokens work on true decentralized exchanges like Forkdelta, Ethex, and more which dont even have hot wallets at all. 
Also now there are pure mined PoW tokens.  That's the future

That's true but if you aren't a poor you could start a production facility.  Elon Musk has built a production facility for SPACESHIPS and SELF DRIVING CARS on his own accord.  Don't try to tell me that building GPUs is harder than that.  It's hard, yes, but not that hard. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 05:08:09
Exactly.   Either way you are just totally gambling.  
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:53:55
Yeah when the hell did that happen?  Maybe its smart ppl trying to get normies to dump so they can buy more 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:39:13
Not possible to fit the run from $0.30 to $3000 on it 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:53:52
Imagine... Being in 2010 buying $4 Bitcoin and thinking about a grown man crying because it hits $3000.   
Boo. Hoo.
Im so sorry for the 100,000% gains over those last 8 years.  Must have been so painful for you.  
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:50:01
Spending Bitcoin is selling it.  You can either sell or hold.  Those who held are happy...
@_date: 2018-12-19 05:32:24
Because its a pain in the ass and requires you to be there M-F 8-5 which you CANT be because you work??? um or you could skip all of that BS and just use bitcoin  ...lol
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:29:58
Or you can just create or own private key or, if that's too hard, buy a hardware wallet!  Having actual control over your hard earned money is a liberating feeling.
@_date: 2018-12-23 22:27:09
Society runs on greed. Nobody would go to work if they didn't want to earn money.  
@_date: 2019-05-22 20:39:26
Ethereum let's anyone make their own bananas!  It's like banana inception.
@_date: 2018-12-06 22:01:42
I think ppl want to learn but they can sound condescending when they ask questions.   Or just flat out mean.    
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:37:33
Actually if they bought Pepsi or Apple or Amazon or Microsoft stock it would have been equally easy to earn one million dollars...... So what do you mean 
@_date: 2018-12-02 15:12:55
Too bad that is done through a completely centralized entity who take full control of your BTC private keys and gives you an IOU on paper in return 
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:19:35
You are mistaking the crypto community and a bunch of shitty ICOs.  Shitty ICOs have tokens made from NOTHING and are not crypto, not even part of the crypto community.

It's an unbiased scientific chart. Do you have another you wish to share ?

ITT: Volumes got to 0.1% of total Forex volumes and that is 'a tremendous amount' 
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:34:25
A whole hell of a lot faster and cheaper than moving REAL gold wouldn't you say ?

Is your coinbase api enabled? It uses no authentication so it's very insecure. It's super easy to write a script that tries to execute malicious actions on tons of random coinbase api keys. Idk what they were thinking when they made their api. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:58:11
If you are a big blocker you are in luck! Just use Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:05:10
and then there is always Litecoin which uses scrypt.
@_date: 2013-12-31 18:33:54
You don't and that's the whole point. It can't be manipulated by 'the liberals. ' It was created specifically for this reason.
