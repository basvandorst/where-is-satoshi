Yeah but when you think of it in opsec terms, if it's a group of people then there's more attack surface.  If it's one guy working securely from a random apartment with the windows closed with perfect opsec and language-to-language translation based grammar obfuscation as some other posters here have suggested, it could be reasonable.  the software itself doesn't require a team to make, it could have easily been made just by him.  the idea that it's a team is, in my mind, propagated by people who don't understand how software development works.  once you understand bitcoin, if you're a good enough dev experienced in cryptography and networking, you can make bitcoin.  and so could satoshi have done without a team.

Not only was he intelligent enough to create something as revolutionary as Bitcoin while also being aware of how important it was, but he also managed to not let it get to his head and try to become a public tech messiah.  It's really altruistic and Satoshi is a great role model.  I suggest we start acting like him and just giving our fruits away for free because it's the RIGHT thing to do.
I hope he's alive and well and uses his immense Bitcoin stores to help the world when the time comes.  I hope he hasn't been caught by some evil government regime.

Not a stupid question
It's because Bitcoin is designed as a decentralized networking protocol.  This means that it works from a sort of swarm of nodes each doing the same thing.  You can't hack them all at once since they're decentralized and owned and ran by different people.  And even if you did, the result would be that we'd just switch back.
