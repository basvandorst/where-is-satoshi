What are the odds that bitcoin is going to go one way or the other?
You tell me, dude.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:20:27
Yup hard pass on that one

Now I know why the price is rocketing.
Look at all these young’ns

It’s really slick and fresher looking but far, far too subtle.
That wouldn’t have made the cut in any actual corporate setting, I’m surprised you actually put it forward.

How is it without your consent ?
You don't want to pay taxes, don't work... move to another country.
On the other hand, if you want to benefit from infrastructure, programs, education and yes "free" healthcare, you pay whatever taxes are owed. There's definitely consent.

@_date: 2017-08-10 18:44:40
stop thinking that way.
You know all those people who bought apple, microsoft, oracle or some other shit in the early days ?
Well 99.9% of them don't have the stocks anymore, they sold along the way.
And the only reason they bought early is because some shmuck sold them his shares.
It's absurd to look at the past and hate yourself for that one decision to sell or not to buy because it actually doesn't come down to ONE decision it comes down to countless. Every single day you would have had to resist selling along the way.
Don't be so hard on yourself. If it really is early days of bitcoin, you're FINE!
Best moment to buy bitcoin was years ago.
Second best is RIGHT NOW!
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:41:08
spot on!
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:18:21
bah, don't be like that.
We have to learn to accept a profit for what it is.
Yes it COULD have been higher.
We ALL could have bought back in 2013.
We could have also bought early Microsoft and Apple and become wealthy beyond measure.
All of that is hypothetical.
OP's gain isn't hypothetical, it's real. That's a *really* good thing.
Well done, OP!

Thankfully people like you don't craft our laws, and we can protect ourselves from rampant white collar crime (non violent) intellectual property (non violent) wrecking the environment or hurting animals (non violent) disrespecting the property of someone else (non violent) stealing (non violent) and various other obvious crimes.

If I could travel in time or influence the past I would *absolutely* funnel amounts of bitcoin to my 2013 self!!! 
Anonymously, so I don’t startle the jittery fuck.
My point is, the person’s proposed explanation makes even more sense with retrospect, but he posted it in 2013!
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:23:39
Regular Waking Up listener here.... it's a very painful episode to listen to.
It also bears reminding he has a very strange position on climate change.
Essentially, climate change is pretty much real, generally... but we shouldn't do anything about it. Because it's impossible to know precisely when it will be the most economically advantageous time to do so.
In other words.... the roof is leaking... definitely leaking, maybe badly... and it's degrading the whole house... but we shouldn't fix it, because maybe a cheaper roofing material will become available soon.
