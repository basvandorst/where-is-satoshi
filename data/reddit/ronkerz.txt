Same. It can reach 1$ and wouldn’t give a fuck. It’s just money. And I would have wasted a lot of money if it reached that low. The only thing that excites me is the technology behind bitcoin and the community.

In the end, you are bitman: The anti scamming superhero
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:19:45
And his address?
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:19:00
Tbh I don’t think I will ever sell my coins. I have done it before regretted immediatly. I am better off holding them forever so I can look at muh glorious internet money. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 23:13:06
Haha I just beat the devil out of it.

I did the same over the past month. Just spending 10-20€ every week to it but I am noticing I am getting less and less when the price is increasing.
@_date: 2017-02-03 11:50:28
3 or 4 days ago I sent 20€ to my other wallet and the fee was only 26 cents
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:18:33
I litterally can't wait for this to happen so I buy more bitcoins for less money. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 13:47:54
Ayy, if you were dutch you could use this website  to check which bitcoin seller provides the best deal. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 12:09:41
Get rid of your antivirus, windows defender is enough
@_date: 2017-02-03 13:54:09
Even better, linux is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:16:25
Can you me this website or app?
@_date: 2017-02-12 08:04:52
Not sure but I don't think telnet is encrypted thus not secure.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:00:00
What ticker do you use?
@_date: 2017-02-02 11:55:28
Where are you from OP?
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:26:33
Thanks for the answer. I am still not sure if I should sell everythjng or buy more. I guess time will tell.
@_date: 2019-11-24 21:24:10
I love the artwork and animations, good job. Are you planning to port it to iOS later?
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:54:19
Oh it's just a digital currency called: FREEDOM. Nothing really special really.
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:03:10
What operating systems do you all use to keep your bitcoins secure? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:31:58
They are still sad if you don't give them some love once in a while :(

Does he have his own satallite? How?
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:09:33
I never knew this existed.  So this is what they mean when the price goes to the moon?

You don’t necessary lose your fortune when you are banned on this subreddit.

spray paint, they probably cut the logo out of a sheet of paper and sprayed over it on the ground
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:06:00
tell me more about your sexual experience.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:35:28
I forget I had some Bcash around because of the fork back then and last night I sold them all and dumped the money back in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:06:47
I sold when it touched 1600. I haven't seen it that high before and I doubt it will ever be that high again. No regrets at all.
@_date: 2019-12-03 21:41:02
And then hope your camera is able to scan the QR. You need to get really close and hope the camera is able to focus well.
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:32:40
You never had it in the first place. They just let you win so they can rip you off comepletely those websites are designed to scam people. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 21:10:54
Not in one atleast
@_date: 2017-04-02 11:48:34
It's just a phishing site ofcourse they make it look legit. And those results are just partners of them probably. It's hard to trust anything these days even if it's on google. I have seen many websites still on google even though they are widely known to be malicious.
I am using the reddit app but I have no gold? Was a limited time thing?
@_date: 2018-11-27 11:54:41
How much does 40k even cost, holy shit OP
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:05:45
This is by far the most trippy thing I watched today, thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:07:35
You can either hate me or thank me for cheap coins.
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:07:45
I use Wirex but I haven't heard anything from them about suspending cards. Maybe they will in the future, eu laws with credit cards are changing.
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:41:49
Everybank in the Netherlands have shitty interest rate. It’s almost nothing now. Once the interest rate goes in the negative I will go all in on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:33:08
Yes you can, there is an android app called Wifi Analyzer which allows you to do that. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:18:31
I ordered two pizzas with fiat last night and bitcoin went up $1000 in a day. Explain.
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:29:30
Sell? You mean buy.
@_date: 2017-09-09 08:14:04
Brilliant! A big mac isn't backed by the federal reserve so it isn't fiat money? It's not currency at all, just genious.
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:04:41
Try Coin Cap, also features alerts 
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:03:10
It’s very sketchy if you get blocked when you ask a question. I am using breadwallet for years and works fine but the same thing. Bcash support is still in development, although atleast you have access to them now. Support is great though.
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:32:30
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:08:13
If bitcoin hits 100k I will still hodl because one day it could hit 1 million ��
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:14:44
Don't we all regret we didn't buy more!
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:10:33
And this is exactly why this technology is invented. Very resourceful of you to find it out this way. I mean most of us just buy it because it could be worth a lot of money later but some of us tend to forget that it IS money.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:51:42
Sorry for the confusion but that was not what I was asking. I am curious to know how did you find out about this technology?
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:46:15
I fcking love those designs. Do you ship to EU? If so how much are the shipping costs?
@_date: 2017-09-01 07:11:39
I wouldn't recommend taking a loan for something so volatile. I mean sure you could make a profit of it but If you don't, you will have to pay a lot of money back which you don't have I assume, otherwise you wouldn't consider taking a loan in the first place.
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:29:41
Jesus this is getting complex but here is my opinion. I don’t think bitcoin could ever replace a currency because of the reasons you mentioned. People want to hodl, it’s usually the main reason people get into bitcoin, because it might be worth a lot later. So what would the solution be? Having 2 currencies.  People want to save but they need to spend it also to live. So people use a currency to buy their daily needs and use the other currency to save. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:04:30
Noobquestion: what is 2x? Did another fork happen?
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:03:58
Yep. That makes you potential target for hackers.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:25:34
I am using breadwallet for the last few years and I absolutely love it. The private keys are stored on your device so there is no server to be hacked. Just make sure you write down your recovery phrase since that is the only way to recover your wallet if you lose your phone.

That classic runescape scam... The memories.. The sadness... The anger... Beautiful.
