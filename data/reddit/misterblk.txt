shit son, you again?Go cry somewhere else if you have no knowledge how to invest.If you bought ATH and sold  now it's because you are stupid and not because BTC is dying.Stupid fuck
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:50:20
well then you should go on real exchange with real volume and real traders so you wouldn't be so amazed by 130btc sell lol
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:52:21
nop, just know the market, just watch after we go to 13k and crash down like never before,or maybe we test 17k but unlikely
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:00:34
loool, in the middle of bear season,says we are at the verge of bull run,just remember you heard it here when we dump to 6k or even lower
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:17:30
like i said before, i only hold 1.5btc now for scalping, everything else is in fiat, so no im not "salty" im waiting to buy the second dip when you weak hands sell it to me
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:00:38
"If price break above 9300 it is the sign of bull" and i make this statement based on absolutely nothing.Funny 
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:32:18
testing 9k tonight kids,hold on to your hats we are in for a ride
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:28:57
it was 130 btc...normal volume on bitfinex is 100+ every minute, you should go look at the bitfinex charts not gdax if you want to see real market movement
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:35:03
the price should test 6k pretty soon,maybe even lower if we break it.And 99% of people doesn't understand that,talking about wave progresions when they dont know shit about trading.See you buying at 6k!
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:50:10
it will test the bottom for sure, never ever in crypto currency's life after a big drop it just went back again, it doesn't happen
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:17:57
lol kids getting exited over 130btc "wall" getting eaten, go watch bitfinex at these times where 4k+ walls get eaten in half a minute, these 100-200 btc "walls' are not walls
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:12:45
the futures doesn't do anything when they finish,they are such a low volume that it doesn't affect bitcoin price in any way when they finish.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:44:23
Actually i have 1.5btc left for scalping and everything else in fiat to buy the second dip.So yeh..see you crying on the next dip :))
@_date: 2018-03-10 22:29:15
you died
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:36:12
I like how the btc is dumping and everyone is OMG btc is dead!! and then it's starts rising and everyne TO THE MOOOOOON, but they don't understand the market and think that it wont crash one more time to test 6k, and if you try to tell them they call you names and say you are stupid lol, crypto world is the best
@_date: 2018-02-28 10:44:47
it did,then we went back again
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:32:41
save the graph and look at it in a week ir two when we crash down to 6k again
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:48:58
3months, like you,MR redditor:)) just don't start crying again after it drops down and you sell low and buy high again lol
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:54:24
because people don't know how to invest and giving they'r money away,but can't complain, that's why it's such a profitable market
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:27:02
someone sold 4.3k btc on bitfinex last crash
@_date: 2018-07-14 08:44:37


dumb money is capitulating, the end is near!
@_date: 2018-07-14 08:24:12




pick one you inbicil
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:29:34
we broke 2.5k btc wall in 2 minutes lol so no it's not gonna be hard
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:25:43
let them buy, if people dont know anything about crypto and investing let them buy at the tops and sell at the bottoms
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:49:25
omfg you made like 10 post here and in almost all of them you said that you lost 60% of what you put in and that you will loose more, lool, you suck
