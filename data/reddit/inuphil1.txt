That's why Coca Cola is one of the biggest companies on earth and much more profitable then Louis Vuitton and co. The range of possible customers is much wider.

Hashpower speaking BTC is Bitcoin. Regards to design BCH aligns more with what Bitcoin was, way before the august fork as it was intended ever since as a digital scares form of cash. Essentially **they are** **both Bitcoin**. Eventually one of them will win. End of story.

I get your point it is not fair. But at the same time it is not fair to break NY Agreement and intentionaly refuse what the community ones wanted to do. Non of both forks is the 'real' bitcoin. Bitcoin lives in both of them and the one that wins will remain the only one. Simple.

Yea be cash.

Yes only what suits your bias is good. If something like that happend to BTC you would be outraged.

Man it was really simple to get that airdrop and no whatsoever confusion. You obviously could not load the airdrop onto a BTC Wallet it only worked on a BCH Wallet. There was no confusion with that. On there wallet app it clearly says Bitcoin Cash.

Reality says different. Many projects that want to attract people to crypto. What does BTC do? Have a science project that want to solve a 30 year old problem in routing that not even could be solved in IRC, instead of spreading BTC to the world. Compete if you want to keep the glory. Thats crypto. Free market. You don't choose for others you don't say don't do that. People will just do. Time will tell.

You guys are getting insane now.

They are both Bitcoin deal with it. Miners don't like the way the project got so they forked. Simple. It was a chain fork. Not a software fork. You can not compare it to Litecoin. Which was the first software fork of Bitcoin. Forks are meant to be. Feature. Remember. Not flaw.

She doesn't even want to understand Crypto or Bitcoin let alone lightning network. She just want to be able to pay for stuff without friction. Simple.

Yes. Heavily expanding ICO. No hardcap. Probably. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:42:53
Exactly.

Is the universe also a scam?

Don't mentioned whitepaper at all. It was set as a Cash System. Settlement is more different then that. Where is my argument flawed in that? As I said they are both bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:35:24
Private yes. Until it scales. IRC. Internet. 30 years of routing problems unsolved. Am really curious, is there now a solution to the routing problem? If not. There goes your privacy.

So what is this then?

As of history we can see that 'truth' belongs always to the winner and that 'truth' can be manufactured and manipulated by censorship.
So you show only what is 'true' which can be halftrue or could be completly false. How do you know when you don't see the entire picture? Do you believe in 911? How can we? Documents missing? Still true because the systems says so? 
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:20:01
Agree, but if it is worth billions and shape the world would the 'truth' not hold itself up? So nobody should worry if anyone makes different arguments about something technical, econmical and in anything that relates to game theoratical aspects compared to Bitcoin? Meaning shouldn't the arguments speak for themselves so why censor at all? Just tired of proving them wrong or is it just an attempt to shut down arguments that could be valid and should be thought through? 
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:38:57
Okay good. I can not predict price, but I would not say it will affect BCH miners, business etc. as they will try to probably continue. Bitcoin is still the most populat gateway for all fiat and not BCH so Bitcoin still moves the whole cryptomarket. We will see if that changes if we see for example binance fiat gateways, if they affect the price of the most popular alternative coins compared to Bitcoin or not. But to say if some popular figure is no more affects price is rather bizare to me.

Yes I know a lot at stake but as you say it does not justify it. Just for example brigewater associates one of the most successful hedge funds currently. Why are they successful? Because they allow intelligent disagreement in their process of trade ideas. If we truely want to make anything better, intelligent disagreement IMO is a ressourceful thing to do. Doesn't mean anything should be implemented. Let the best arguments win rather to censor everything that is opposed to your own thoughts and believes.

It is a business of course it can be assigned. Are you saying you are favoring the thought of killing someone just because you don't agree in what he is doing ��
