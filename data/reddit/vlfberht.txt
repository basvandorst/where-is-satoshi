Ability to comment properly work is important indeed.

I've had no problems with Chase. How was it confirmed? Or are we to believe strangers on the internet out of hand.
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:34:53
Yep. They are slow. ACH is used to debit bank accounts, and ACH has chargebacks while bitcoin does not. This means they need to be fairly certain that they'll get your money before they give you theirs.
I'd also add that Coinbase is funded by Andreessen Horowitz. I don't trust Coinbase so much as I trust their investors to protect their investment.
That said, I still don't trust them with more than I'm willing to lose, just like a classic physical wallet.

It seems many are still not aware that insurance is already available. [Elliptic Vault]( is underwritten by [Lloyd's of London](

Send them an e-mail. Ask them to whitelist your account and honor the original transaction. If you don't have terrible info out there, you'll probably get the coins at that price.
Do you still have your money? Then they didn't scam you.

From [PSA: Chase closed my account due to activity with Coinbase](


My account is fine. As far as I can tell, this is pure FUD and is eating it up.

The latest reports about Chase are totally unsubstantiated. Give me one good reason we should believe these people:
Both of them have posts with over two hundred karma with no evidence.

Do you seriously expect them to put bitcoinaverage.com in their S-1 and prospectus?


@_date: 2014-02-26 15:55:40


I see someone rationalizing their decision and planning to make the same mistake again. Proving the existence of your coins doesn't prove their ability to keep them.
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:27:29
Me neither.

A subpoena doesn't indicate suspicion of wrongdoing at all. It's just an order to testify or produce evidence they might have.

"You save XX%"
Pretty much similar to how brick and mortars jack up the reference price for sales. You're not saving 50% at Macy's.

The guy yesterday is claiming it was a personal account.

Which is regulated by the state.

Those they do officially with no shame. This is a free time project by a Google engineer.
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:57:12


Did you expect them to use bitcoinaverage.com?

The fiat withdrawal issue was a giant red flag.

Said the habitual troll.

The subject is Circle. The feds want to know what they know about gox. There's no indication of anything more than that.

Because his life doesn't revolve around Bitcoin? To each his own.
