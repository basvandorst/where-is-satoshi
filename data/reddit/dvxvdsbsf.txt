You're right. He's right too.  
Nobody owns the name. But fraud by deception can still apply if there is a clear attempt to mislead the customer.  
IE. I cannot advertise bitcoin for sale, take your money and then give you a rock. A clear pattern of doing this would be fraud.  
Where the line is between Bitcoin and rocks I'm not sure, it would likely need some legal precedent to establish whether Bitcoin Cash can or can not reasonably be defined as "Bitcoin"

This simply isnt true. Bitcoin cashes core proponents (Ver et al) want to increase blocksize indefinitely, without delay. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:39:39
This is true, but the way Ethereum is programmed is not what allowed the contracts to be hacked either. That was because of the way Parity programmed their smart contract. A more accurate eqivalancy perhaps is calling PHP exploitable because some websites do not parse PHP in their login forms before sending it to a MySQL server. This is not a vulnerability of PHP, but one of the website. The bug with Parity was not a vulnerability of Ethereum, but a vulnerability of the contract

you mean the DAO fork? Yes, their contract was buggy too.  
If you mean "why the old side of the chain had people stand by it", thats because some people believed that 'code is law' with crypto, and the rollback shouldnt happen.   
That doesnt mean that Eth is any less immutable than BTC though. If concensus votes for a roll back to a certain block height, it will happen to Bitcoin too.

I'm no Ethereum maximalist by any means but I feel that summary is a little unfair.    
EXPLOITS AND WEAKNESSES       
 
Those arent weaknesses with Eth. They were badly implemented contracts. Its like saying Bitcoin has exploits and weaknesses because MtGox was hacked.  
NO SUPPLY CAP    
Bitcoins hard limit can be forked out too    
NOT AN IMMUTABLE BLOCKCHAIN    
Eth is immutable in the same way BTC is. BTC is mutable in the same way Eth is. If the devs and community go with the side of the fork that rolls back transactions the same can happen to Bitcoin. We can roll back to any block if there is concensus.

I'd like to point out that people who treat it like a get-rich-quick scheme are missing the point entirely. The tech is very real, very valuable and a true paradigm shift.   
People who treat it like a get rich quick scheme are just the most easily noticeable because talking about tech makes your average joe switch off, talking about 10x returns in a year makes people want to have an opinion one way or the other
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:37:07
there is no such thing as 100% decentralised. Decentralisation is a scale. For it to be 100% decentralised it needs to be split across each and every piece of matter in the observable and non-observable universe, and beyond. Which is clearly absurd.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:29:16
that's just untrue. I live somewhere where average daily wage is $5. They save using cash under the pillow or gold on their necks. Gold is useful because if there is an emergency they can take it to a pawnshop and get a loan based on the value of the gold, but this eats away at their savings as rates are predatory, and they usually cannot get the money together to pay back the loan.  
In Africa, one of the main things many save for is a bicycle. Bikes open up oppurtunities but on a daily wage of $2, they save for a long time to be able to pay the $20-25 for a 2nd hand refurbed bike. They cannot get loans because they have no proof of a consistent $2 per day, since traditional banking is inpractical for that. With a crypto-banking statement, they can show proof of earnings, and maybe get a  loan to pay for the bicycle, accelerating their business and improving their lives.  
     
So basically no matter how little they make, there is a need for saving money. There may be a desire for loans. Micro-banking is a perfect fit for crypto-currency, they could even do it without a mobile device using internet shops or 3rd party services built on top of existing facilities like you get a mobile top-up   
  
Edit: also relevant:

It is highly volatile because it is a low $ total in circulation with unregulated markets and few derivatives in place to reduce volatility. Increase total held by 10 more widely distributed amongst people who wish to use it day to day and add some derivatives and suddenly you'll see volatility reduced somewhat.   
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:17:46
its easiest explained to people if you describe it as fake dollars I find.   
Imagine the housing market. Someone prints a bazillion fake dollars in their basement and buys half the houses in the US. The price of houses goes up as there is high demand.   
But then, someone finds out how to spot the fake notes (Tether audited and failed)  
People realise one guy owns half the property in the US paid for with fake money and will likely have his assets liquidated and property sold off on open market (since fraud is a crime). Also, there will be no future fake high demand as he can no longer run his scam. People panic sell their properties since they know the price will crash.

**Bitcoin is supposed to be attacked.**  
If we find ourselves needing to appeal to centralised sources of power to "*save Bitcoin*" and "*protect it from attackers*" then it has already failed as an idea.   
Embrace the attacks, they make Bitcoin all the more stronger. Let BCH use the most popular Bitcoin related account on the most popular social network to try and undermine the power of the system. If it succeeds, Bitcoin was never worth anythign in the first place. If it fails, then Bitcoin has added another immunity to its system.  
Think of it as a vaccine. You might no like the little prick, but it's making you all the stronger for it.

Yes I have heard this from Dapp devs repeatedly. Noone likes solidity... There were ways for Parity to get the contract audited though, and they declined. They were negligent and paid the price.   
Any programmer can have the contract audited, and in future, if not already, they will be able to insure their contracts against vulnerabilities.   
 
It's an annoyance, but I wouldnt call it a vulnerability of Eth.

This is not how I understand it. Please correct me if Im wrong but it is the mining nodes which are the core of the network, all non-mining nodes do is relay transactions to and from mining nodes. A 51% majority of miners will still be able to impose their will, and the minority will be forked off along with the non-mining nodes that side with them   
So since miners have power to create blocks and non-mining nodes can only relay transactions then they really do nothing to secure the network      
UNLESS    
*you actually use that node to personally validate your own transactions*.  In which case it secures your bitcoin, but not so much the network.   
Again, I hope someone can step in and correct me if wrong. But this is basically what I have heard from Luke Jr core dev himself, unless I grossly misunderstood him.

thankyou, I do think Eth is more centralised in many ways, mainly the Ethereum foundation, and Vitalik as a flag-bearer, but on the scale of decentralisation those things aren't too dreadful. The Foundation works in Eths best interests, and decentralisation is at Eths heart so if that is threatened further then value will quickly fall. Vitalik would be a big loss, but over time Eth could recover, there are many great minds working on it.   
I dont see it beating Bitcoin as the decentralised store of value/currency, Bitcoin is laser focused in that respect.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:53:47
Bitcoin is designed to operate in a no-holds barred environment.   
Attacks like this were always going to happen. The public will learn from this attack that there really is no representative for Bitcoin, and future attacks of this nature will be less effective. Hence why I call it a vaccination.     
I'm not sure how you suggest Bitcoin "adapt" to this sort of attack, market retaliation was a built in factor of Bitcoin- those who understand it's nature will educate the misled and stand up for it when they can. I guess that includes making appeals to centralised authorities when applicable too though, people can fight for Bitcoin in whatever way they want- that also is part of Bitcoins design.     
I just see a use of resources attempting to persuade Twitter that the  account is stealing a 'brand' which is not protected as futile and a waste of time, and in the long run, being attacked in this way will be a positive for Bitcoin.   
An alternative future is one where people trust and respect the  account as a champion for Bitcoins core values, and then sometime in the future the owner is outed as being a child molesterer, or governments condemn the account as promoting money laundering, and twitter bans it, or any other number of scenarios. A userbase which understands bitcoins mechanics now is better for future growth. Perhaps you could argue that a future attack would be less effective and allow Bitcoin to grow stronger roots now, I dont think either of us really know which way is 'better'  
Either way though, it will happen eventually. Embrace it, after this chat, I will also embrace the backlash to it  :)

Bitcoin is not 100% concensus required for the main chain to roll back. 97% of Eth holders voted for Dao fork.

Yeah segwit 2x was not a safe proposal, a rushed increase and very dangerous. I have watched a fair few videos featuring core devs, and the ones I have seen they all I believe agreed that a blocksize increase would be good to explore, but it's something that should be done very carefully and *not* rushed. Perhaps there are more that disagree with that though, there are over 100 core devs right now IIRC.  
  
Watching the vid you linked now. I agree with what he is saying, that on-chain scaling does not seem to be sustainable indefinitely. Perhaps 2mb would be good though, and be sufficient to allow more growth until 2nd layer solutions refined.  
It is indeed a 3-4 year deep can of worms haha :)

1. Bitcoin is not just for the people who code it.  
2. Calling people names is childish, ironic given you were calling him a child for having an opinion.  
3. Bitcoin *does* need to work on it's utility as a currency, that is is percisely why LN is being developed  
4. Downvoting me won't change these facts.  
5. You will get much further by sticking to facts than calling people names, all that will do is alienate people who disagree with you, not convince them otherwise.        
I agree that Ver should not be calling BTC cash "BTC". If he thinks his side of the coin is the real Bitcoin, then he has already "won". His side of the coin exists, people can use it. That is all an altruistic proponent of Bitcoins ideals should want, for the option to be there for people.  
It does not need to be the leading coin in market cap, just existing is enough.

Narrative? I agree it is a narrative for some, and I am tired of their fallacies. But for many many users who are getting frustrated with high transactions it is not just a narrative. I was fine with paying $2.75 last week to move 5 figures in 24 hours (3inputs). I am not so happy now I had to wait roughly 6 hours after paying $60 to move 4 figures yesterday (2 inputs)   
Also, Bitcoin is supposed to not just be fit for purpose, but fit for purpose *while under state level attacks*   
I mean, I agree with pretty much everything you are saying, except it is not just a narrative. I guess we just have to wait though, the tech is coming.

Futures are regulated, ticker is regulated, allows for one of main SEC objections to be struck off (no reliable price metric)  
Also another objection to recent ETF application removed (no underlying instruments)  
   
Also ETN is different to an ETF, its shares in a fund like a bond or debt note. It led to overpriced purchases of Bitcoin with price being around 1.5x that of Bitcoin due to limited shares issued. Demand was so high investors were paying 50% premium over BTC price to get it in their portfolio. So an ETF would remove that bottleneck

 the good thing about Bitcoin mining is that it can be carried out on site of energy generation. The energy does not need to be transported anywhere. We see mining taking place *inside* hydro-electric dams, and we could eventually see off-planetary solar powered mining very easily.  
 If this sounds like a lot of effort, remember what mining secures.

all nodes cost money to run though, so all suffer centralisation in that sense. A raspberry pi and basic internet connection are vastly cheaper than 1000x$1000 (the total value of Dash needed to run a Dash node) so perhaps Dash nodes are already centralised beyond what Bitcoin desires

I thought these would be, but if not then ETFs which are backed by actual bitcoin as per the winklevoss March'17 proposal are almost inevitable, eventually.   
The futures market and tickers allow for one of the SECs main objections of the winkleoss ETF to be struck out, that there was no accurate price measure not subject to unregulated market manipulation.      
If we were to only receive cash based ETFs then there would indeed be incredible buying pressure and a need to hedge that risk by sellers though.    
Disclaimer: not an expert. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:06:00
Vers idea of scaling is just increasing blocksize repeatedly. He sees no problem in the network centralising to just a couple dozen nodes. He is putting fee size and trans speed above the security and decentralisation of the network. Oh, and he benefits from covert ASICboost which gives him unfair advantage and compromises network centralisation and efficiency

this is a common misunderstanding of how market cap works. If all the buy offers on the exchanges were pulled and price instantly dropped to effectively zero, no money *left* the market cap and yet suddenly 500 billion of market cap is now zero.     
Likewise, if I submit a buy offer for 1/100th of a bitcoin at $10 higher than the current market price, and that buy is untaken, it does not mean that all existing coins are now worth 10% more.  
 
Market cap does not correspond to total invested in the marketplace

yeah all this stuff in the OP about massive volatility and doubling of price due to futures is a bit off base. The futures have fuse breakers built in, its something like if the price rises or falls more than 10% from the daily price then trading is paused.  
Futures are expected to lower volatility, but increase liquidity and most likely buy side pressure.

It may seem like splitting hairs but treating bitcoin as a purely speculative asset is overlooking its fundamental value. There's no need to make this an argument, I simply stated that *if the price were to stop going up, it doesnt mean it is then too late to buy Bitcoin*. It has value beyond being speculative.

Imagine someone was building a boat that was immune to any weapon on earth, and could sail anywere in the world within an acceptable amount of time with no way for anyone to stop you from doing so. Its taking them at least 1 more year, so you cannot use it yet except for very slow and expensive tugboat drawn rides which last far too long and are not really enjoyable.   
   
Someone else comes along and says they have a boat which can take you to the exact same place where you are planning on going, and it is ready now, but it will be in a poor condition in a year from now and wont be able to sail as far or wide and will be pretty much susceptible to any weapon thrown at it.   
    
Do you rejoice that the world will have the perfect boat soon, or do you say you may as well burn the 1st boat to the ground, as you can get where you need to go using the 2nd boat?   
   
Remember, Bitcoin is not about making something which goes up in price non-stop. It is about making something which can do amazing things for the world for a long time to come. Price may take a hit while people use the 2nd boat for now, but the 1st boat is the one which will stand the test of time.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:09:05
I agree with you wholeheartedly. I sure hope they are a non-representative minority, but I just keep bumping into them somehow!  
I think a lot of people have just gone too far in opposing Ver and BCH, and now oppose everything that they have ever said or supported. I too see the contradiction in developing LN while claiming high fees for users are good, so it hurts my brain trying to understand why people are saying such things. I can only put it down to people trying to say anything to justify the current state of the BTC network and put down BCH. BTC is the winning coin for me, but that does not mean it is faultless right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:26:17
I dont like this argument. Its almost like:

 "If your job treats you like shit, cant you just leave it?"  
etc etc  
Bitcoin is not a game, yes participation is voluntary, but it carries very high importance to many people. If the government took over bitcoin somehow tomorrow, would you see nothing wrong with that too as people can "just choose not to use it"? Or would you be *pissed*

That sort of talk will get you banned from all the crypto subreddits these days. I guess the drama is a crucial part of the bitcoin evolution process though. If it cannot survive in the presense of drama, then it is dead already. Kind of sucks but its a necessary evil hey.       
You seem to have a far better grasp of LN than I could hope to so I cant comment on that. I think the risk of increasing blocksize incrementally and cautiously is overstated, but that there is also no rush to do so. Bitcoin is not a company and development should not be done with coin price as it's priority.     
I do feel that the future holds a variety of scaling solutions as you say, cities do not rely on any one solution for traffic management, neither does the internet. These comparisons should hold true on Bitcoin too as they share a lot of characteristics.     
Anyway, I'm just repeating things which I'm sure you've heard before so I will stop.

Don't use being anonymous as a reason to use it. Thats asking for it to be associated with drugs and terrorists and all sorts, a conversation about policing and banning it will ensue every time if you lead with that.  
What you should do is say it's a currency which gives you absolute control over it, no entity can interfere or confiscate those funds. It is a digital currency with absolute freedom from any banks, governments or companies. You can then follow up with other benefits such as being impossible to forge, easy and relatively fast to send worldwide, an unalterable ledger, etc etc
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:36:50
Vers philosophy is to continually scale on-chain and avoid 2nd layer solutions. He is fine with a couple dozen nodes   
I've also held BTC since around $220, seems we got in around the same time. The last 3 years have been frustrating to say the least I agree. Development has been slowed to a snails pace as debate and conflict took center stage and most of peoples efforts. As long as we walk away from all of this with at least one chain which resists centralisation then Bitcoin the idea has still succeeded. It doesnt have to be the Bitcoin core chain we see today. So really we are just debating whether Vers vision or Cores vision is closer to the spirit of Bitcoin. After much soul searching I feel it to be Cores vision, as node centralisation and rapidly increasing blocksize is an area where you cannot reverse changes and may soon run into severe difficulties worse than slow transactions and high fees.   
Also to rejig and interrupt development so drastically by shifting it to BCH would add more years to the roadmap alone.   
I want the solution to be here and now too, but the best longterm solution seems to be as Satoshi did say, keep the block size small for as long as possible. In time, we can remove those limits. But we do not need to rush it just to keep the price and adoption flying up fast. We certainly do not want to actively seek to increase blocksize as fast as possible.   
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:17:31
thankyou, I forgot that miners are nodes. Maybe we could limit voting to non-mining nodes, take a snapshot of active non-mining nodes *before* casting the vote, or use nodes with a certain uptime over past x days/weeks    
Would this address ost of the issues you mention? Or would node centralisation still occur as many nodes can be owned by one entity
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:09
it's not 'whether it reaches a certain price', think of it as agreeing to sell that coin for an agreed price. But you dont complete the sale yet, you do it some time in the future.   
This market will be cashed settled though, so youre agreeing to buy a wad of cash worth the same as one bitcoin from the seller, for a price you agree now. If BTC goes up in value past what you agreed, you made money. If the price goes down and Bitcoin is worth cents when you complete the sale, you paid $15k for a bag of cents.  
Hope that makes sense

that may be true yes, it stops some people from buying. If it were stable though, some people looking for growth wouldnt be buying. So it kind of works both ways  
  
Stability is different to size of coin price though.   
You could say the coin price is in a bubble due to x y z reasons but without context the price itself isnt a reason for concern.  
I agree it is in a bubble (or at least, was!) but then so are Facebook, Tesla, Apple, the reason being that many people buy them just because they see them as historicaly well performing, and not because the price per share is good or they understand the underlying assets well enough

So if I opened two twitter accounts, and posted the same thing in support of Greg Maxwell on both, that makes Greg a sociopath too?

Ah so we're talking semantics of price/value then. But you agree the value can be worthless even though OP refuses to sell. If noone is willing to spend a cent buying it, it's a pretty solid indication that it has no value.
@_date: 2018-05-28 12:02:57
Well what we were really debating is what the person you replied to said:   


 
We can see Bitcoin is very clearly designed to be a currency/payment method as described by Satoshi himself     


So I stand by my statement that making it unpractical for payments under $5/$10/$50 (where is the line?) is making it a pretty poor currency, for the internet or otherwise. Whether it is suitable for a cup of coffee or not is a good litmus test for it's practicality for day-to-day transactions and general usefulness as a currency.

I was with you 100% up until you said "It actively misleads people"   
It doesnt do anything, it is certain individuals who are doing that. It's like how posts a comment by a random individual from on their sub-reddit and says "look what Core are saying now!"     
@_date: 2018-05-09 07:58:33
Except that's not true, its when an equilibrium is found between the purchasing power. One person with enough money could prop up the price against the rest of the world selling.
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:29:29
Theoretically, if it is worthless then noone will bother. Bitcoin testnet coins are $0, how many of those do you have   
But really my point is, it doesnt matter if OP refuses to sell or not. His money won't prop the market cap and price up as he seems to think. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:18:18
nope, just someone tired of bullshit being thrown by both sides
@_date: 2018-05-28 07:36:32
They fail at being a global currency for those reasons. Bitcoin is supposed to be a global currency. If we start to say that Bitcoin can not be used for purchases under $5/10/50/$1k(?) then we are cutting off bitcoins legs

Ah but that is a different scenario. Zero buy orders, zero sell orders. Basically a non-existant market. We are talking about just OP and some others refusing to sell, and noone buying.  In that scenario the price would trend to zero
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:53:45
I don't feel that's enough to make the whole concept of the coin a scam, not in the context of the claimed ideology of the coin (wanting to be what Bitcoin was originally designed to be).    
If the big banks tomorrow managed to get the longest chain/most hashpower behind their centralised, anti-libertarian fork of BTC, would you be fine with them taking the name Bitcoin, or would you still consider the truly decentralised chain to be the real Bitcoin regardless? I suspect you wouldn't object to it being called something with Bitcoin in the name, and I doubt you would call it a scam for doing so. That's pretty much the real, imagined or feigned scenario (depending on who you ask) going on in many BCH supporters heads right now. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:54:42
I agree. Although I wouldnt say BCH are innovating more than BTC, they are just exploring easily implemented, more trivial things.
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:30:28


 
But I'm willing to give my toenail clippings away for free, since pretty much everyone else is willing to accept a payment for them, no matter how small, they are worthless to me. That is prices being bid down.       
Free markets have prices being bid up and down simulataneously until parties agree upon a price. 


I dont dispute that, that doesnt mean it cannot become worthless though. I dont think it will, but my opinion does not influence fact any more than yours or OPs does
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:52:55


Funny how simply saying that *"Bitcoin should be usable as electronic cash"* gets you labelled and looked down on these days. How times have changed.      
        


I'm far from one to kiss Satoshis ass, but this is an odd statement. I mean I assume you have'nt surveyed everyone else to make such claims. It seems like just an attempt to rubbish "Satoshis vision" and push this debate into "BCH vs BTC" territory, with all the pre-canned arguments that entails. Sorry, I don't want that, I won't bite.    


  
You were just chewing me out for assuming he wanted Bitcoin to be global, now you are telling me what he meant by "cash". Satoshi, not because I am appealing to a sense of authority but because you brought up what he meant by that, many times talked about low fees and other things which would imply the same utility value (or even better) as paper cash    
 
     
My simple, humble opinion, is that Bitcoin would be well served by aiming to include low value payments like the typical coffee payment. It would enable people to donate modest amounts to causes such as wikileaks or PETA if they choose without facing government scrutiny. It would allow people to send small amounts across borders to their families regularly without being branded a terrorist or having their funds frozen. It would be suitable for a number of other use cases and it would be a pretty damn good currency. Sure, we can choose to make it impractical to encompass those payments to make it *ever so slightly secure* for the higher value users, but there is a trade-off and the law of diminishing returns is very much a factor.          
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:01:43


Exactly. So it could.
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:36:57
No I think this is perfectly acceptable. Noone is getting tricked about anything, addending "core" to Bitcoin is not able to confuse anyone from doing something unintended. It's entirely different to describing BCH as Bitcoin, which I was personally against.   
@_date: 2018-05-06 22:11:35


   
You already spent time. I'm asknig that you spend less, by actually answering the question instead of derailing the conversation. But you wont. If you check my post history, I have criticised Ver over many things. I don't like the BCH approach. I'm a fan of LN and other core developments. I hold a significant amount of Bitcoin, and sold my BCH a loooong time ago, keeping a small amount as a hedge.       
The only concern troll here is you, you throw out strawmen like no tomorrow so I tear them down and show you how Ver has flaws. I know he has. That doesnt mean I will resort to the same bullshit as you. You have fun with it though
@_date: 2018-05-21 06:49:30
It doesnt matter how unlikely it is. It is possible.
@_date: 2018-05-10 08:57:19
"Because it is MY coin and I am trying to scam you"   
It comes down to intent again yes, and brings me back to the points about context of the philosophical battle being bought (or acted out in pursuit of scamming people)     
I have said before on Reddit, you can probably find it in my posting history, Roger Ver saying BCH is BITCOIN on his website is very sketchy legal ground. He has every right to say it is BITCOIN CASH and that it is closer to the original vision of BITCOIN than BTC, as BITCOIN is not a protected brand and thats how open-source software can evolve, eg LINUX implementations. If he wants to say BCH=BITCOIN then he needs to follow that with a clear disclaimer about what he means by that and that it is not the same definition given by the average person in the market, or open himself to accusations of fraud.    
He probably came to the same conclusion, hence changing the ticker on his site.
@_date: 2018-05-06 19:31:37
Usually people say that when they have proven their point, not when it has fallen flat. I hate this style of debate you are using. It's very American high school. Choose an opinion and then assault everyone else with anything vaguely resembling an argument until they give up on you so you can say you "won". Like I said, find me the fraud and I'll call him a fraudster. Instead you come at me with shit like "concern troll" which I don't think even means what you think it means, and now here we are talking about what a concern troll is and how the pest control 2000 was sold by other fireworks resellers several years ago and the ethics of doing so when the whole fucking point we should be talking about is fucking miles away from that, it's the approach to scaling a crypto-currency should take. People like you are a massive cancer on crypto and basically every other topic that exists, and the reason people like Trump can take office as they have.   
It's exhausting dealing with you and people like you, it's a waste of time and I usually make it a rule now, never reply to insincere commentors, you will only get insincere comments 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:17:58
I wouldnt say he created BCH to scam people. He created BCH as he thinks its the best way to scale BTC, and he sincerely thinks that BTC has been taken over by corporate interests. He has bent some rules and broken some laws to push BCH in any way he can as he perceives this to be an all out war between decentralised money and a hijacked Bitcoin.      
Now, whether or not his perception of reality is true is open to debate.  But I wouldnt say he is a fraudster either way, just someone who has possibly waded a little out of his depth on the tech side and isnt afraid of breaking rules to achieve what he wants.    
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:57:03
I have no idea what you mean by that
@_date: 2018-05-05 17:19:26
find the instance of fraud, and I'll agree. You cant just call things you dont like, fraud
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:29:13
that's the exact same argument I have used in the past. I agree. It doesnt make rocks a scam though, it makes the person selling rocks a scammer. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:17:02


Not necessarily. I mean most people won't give it away for free to make the last price $0, just in case it becomes worth something again, so in that sense the last traded price would be an amount above 0. But really people who say they would buy as much as possible at 1 cent are kidding themselves, they are the same ones who say they wish they had bought at $x.xk but then when the price hits that again, they dont. Putting a significant amount of money into an asset which is next to worthless is a very difficult decision to make,far harder than just saying you would.    
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:03:55
if people stop buying altogether it will go to zero. It doesnt matter if you refuse to sell or not, if noone wants to buy it anyway
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:44:56


I really meant the chain with most pow behind it, which is the same as you say yes. Sorry.  


Yes absolutely, but I'm just playing devils advocate really. The people calling BCH Bitcoin, for the most part, are not doing so with the intent to scam but to fight what they see as a corporate takeover of Satoshis implementation. I don't think it's fair or accurate to call it a scam coin in that context. Are they misappropriating the name? Maybe. But that doesnt make it a scam, imo.
@_date: 2018-05-05 18:29:35
ok so the fact that most of that is misrepresented nonsense or other, albeit questionable acts which are absolutely not fraud doesnt raise any alarm bells for you?     
"Antpool = Viabtc conclusive proof" for example.   
Have you even looked at it? It's not proof, not even evidence, not even slightly suggesting they are the same entity. Actually look through the links. I have.

The cognitive dissonance some of you guys caught up in this "throw shit at the other side and see what sticks" is absurd. Concern troll?

@_date: 2018-05-21 06:46:50
The last price traded is not necessarily the current price or value though. Imagine a painting by a new artist. It sells for $10. He then becomes president of the US. That painting is now worth significantly more, even though its last traded price was $10.      
Things can change in value without the exchanges or last traded price reflecting that. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:27:11

@_date: 2018-05-09 20:26:22
Ah ok, if working with that logic then how about this scenario.   
BTC evolves into a coin which is under banker control via subterfuge and misguided concensus. Libertarians fork away, but the BTC under banker control is too heavily integrated into the system to lose hashpower and remains the longest chain. Again, that's pretty much the same sort of situation many BCH supporters perceive to be reality now. It would be a real stretch to call the coin which forked away from that banker coin a scam, just because they chose to keep Bitcoin in the name. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 09:19:05
What I said was:   


Im not asking the government to enforce anything. Just saying that it allows for discussion on television explaining how Bitcoin has no central website or company behind it and how that might educate a few people.

I have no problem with it being presented like this. You may not agree with it, but it is a philosophical debate in which this is a perfectly acceptable statement to be made. Rebutt it, or don't. Call for censorship, and don't be surprised when you end up being the one who is censored one day

Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:50:39
if the free money was paid in cash, would you buy BCH with that cash? There is a tendency for people to rationalise not doing anythign in situations like this, it is part of the reason many see buying BTC as risky- ignoring the fact that not buying it is risking USD going down in value relative to BTC.  
Ignore where the chips land, and think about where you would put them if they werent placed automatically

this exact same thing has happened on betfair.com, and the law was unquestionably on betfairs side.

@_date: 2017-08-15 07:17:59
Just a thought while Im having a sandwich, so please feel free to ignore me.  
One of the often touted disadvantages of BTC is "what if you dont have internet?" Well how about a server that uses a different method for receiving transactions, eg cell phone signals. Its all just 1s and 0s right. You would need to create a cell phone app (which works offline) that sends out maybe an SMS to your server, which then converts that to traditional data for BTC transaction processing.   
Would be pretty good for the developing world!

I was happy with the idea of higher block capacity at some point in the future (NOT the rushed S2x implementation) with 2nd layer solutions if neccessary. But the idea of claiming that "high fees are good for bitcoin" while pushing to create off-chain solutions to lower those fees does not sit well with me and comes across as purely manipulative, especially in light of Adam Backs email regarding pushing for off-chain solutions 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:52:09
Ok, so an immutable blockchain + cheap transactions = more value than just being immutable
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:12:50
That is true yes. In the case of BCH, the concensus is that it is not "Bitcoin", however Roger Ver does like to pretend it is. He is happy to confuse the situation by outright saying to people "Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin", implying it is the same one they hear about in the news hitting $8k per coin. At what point does that become fraudulent? Anyone can fork Bitcoin, if I make a fork and call it "Bitcoin" and then start selling it to people for $6.5k "special offer" that would fit very well under "fraud by deception"  
It is similiar to me getting a lump of fools gold and trying to pass it off as real, hey they share the same DNA right? I can totally see your point but I feel he is stepping over the line of advertising it as "Bitcoin based" and possibly acting fraudulently

So if that amount is higher than you can afford, you will simply move to another coin I assume. As will many others. Perhaps BTC becomes significantly less popular as a result and loses  spot, loses miners, loses users, and loses its appeal as a store of value to a more widely used (and therefore stable) currency.

A. "I'm going to buy some Fireworks"  
 
or  
B. "I'm going to buy some agricultural grade explosives"     
   
OPs post was inflammatory and highly suggestive of saying Ver is some form of terrorist. I'm not the only person to think so. Call him a criinal, call him irresponsible, call his acts highly dangerous and profiteering with little respect for others safety, that's fine by me. But let's not try and mislead the people here who skim the headlines

I never disputed the fact that he is a convicted criminal or that his actions were irresponsible. I am saying that presenting what he did using the terms used is purposely misleading.    
I have no problem with that law. I have no problem with his conviction. I do have a problem with trying to impress upon people that he was selling explosives for nefarious uses when they were recreational fireworks.    
The exact wording used by the OP is intentionally misleading. That's the problem. Or would you say that we should describe him with the exact words one could use to describe an AlQuaeda operative?     
Just so you understand what I am saying: He broke the law. It was stupid, irresponsible, dangerous. But he was not "manufacturing explosives" in the way one would reasonably interperet the OPs graphic. Trying to paint him as some sort of terrorist is pathetic and no matter what side of the debate you stand you should be able to say it is disingenuous. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:13:30
nooo I didnt mean those sorry :)  
Companies which build on BTC network. Services and retailers built around blockchain, BTC in particular. Primarily miners and nodes though which have invested a lot of resources into making the network physically available.    
Also number of users! The relative value of a network is represented by "Metcalfe's law", which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). You can think of it like facebook I suppose. It is connecting people. The people on Facebook make it worth more, if noone was there, its valuation would be almost nothing as it wouldnt be backed by real users. There would be no asset (the users) to make it worth bothering with

What I meant by that is the law being broken is not so important as what he actually did to break that law.  
It absolutely matters that it was only fireworks, that is why the OP would never have said 'fireworks' in his infographic instead of "agricultural grade explosives". He wouldnt have said this as it wouldnt have given the desired effect, that Roger Ver is some sort of borderline terrorist.  
We need to be intellectually honest or the discussion falls apart. Case in point, here we are talking about this, instead of something more constructive!

I have had long and frustrating discussions with people on this subreddit who will outright tell me that "high fees are good for Bitcoin"  
Like I get that miners need to be paid and it represents the security of the network and all that jazz, but BTC can lose its place as a store of value if a bigger market cap is built by a coin with better day to day use cases.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:59:22
It's pretty widely known that it was fireworks he was making, if he was making explosives in the normal sense and not just the legal definition he would have served much more than 10 months.  
If you want to argue that "Bitcoin Cash is bad because Roger Ver sold explosives" then your argument is weak. I want to hear real reasons why Bitcoin should do this or that or something else. Not character assasinations.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:50:54
and a vast percentage of bitcoin holders expect the issue of rising fees to be addressed at some point  
note: in a way that doesnt increase centralisation or compromise on it's core values

oh? That's not what I have read, source please?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:34:52


That is true, but he is not just thinking. He is lying to people to get them to purchase BCH. I say this completely neutrally in terms of BCH v BTC, (in fact I was standing up for Ver in this forum just the other day over some rubbish people were using to make him out to be something he is not, and I have openly criticised core decisions)   
 
I can see things getting ugly for him if he continues to advertise a coin he has a vested interest in, as something it is not. It's fraud by deception, and crypto being regulated or unregulated is not going to change that fact.     
Back to the gold analogy, Gold is decentralised and the name is not trademarked. However, if I were to fork by making a 0.001% gold and 99.999% fools gold alloy, and then try to pass it off as gold via Ebay, I would be charged for fraud. This is how I see calling a crypto Bitcoin when it is a fork of bitcoin that society has agreed is not bitcoi, and doing so for personal financial gain.

there's literally zero difference. If you hold old fashioned currency in the first place, you were betting against bitcoin.  
Holding altcoins to trade against $ is betting against bitcoin. Doing anything except putting all of your assets into bitcoin is betting against bitcoin to a degree.  
EDIT: I'm being downvoted for simple logic, lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:26:02
"Bitcoin" is "Bitcoin". "Bitcoin Cash" is "Bitcoin Cash". It's a clear distinction, so telling people that "Bitcoin Cash" is "Bitcoin", is false. Or would you not have a problem with a website advertsing their "Ethereum Classic" for sale as "Ethereum"
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:16:22
Also with 24:1 leverage and $300 capital, if the BTC price went down from 7,000 to 6,987.50 (down just $12.50) you would be liquidated and lose the lot.

You do realise more people selling, and fewer buying, is *decreasing* the number of holders? If your statement is true, and it seems to be just conjecture, it actually proves my point.     
eg. 10 people sell their coin. 6 people buy that coin. It has gone from 10 holders to 6.   


I didnt realise there was open statistics on who were the buyers and sellers of BTC at any given time. When I say you are grasping I mean you are just making things up which you feel fit your narrative of this being "good for Bitcoin"

Yes. I sold my Tether a long time ago and I avoid exchanges which use it.

if I had $100k in a chinese exchange now, as a resident, I would most likely withdraw it in BTC though. Not to bank, assuming its a ~5 day transaction time and could be subject to a lot of delays or holds. So there might be a lot less selling-off than anticipated. Dunno, just a thought

If you dont understand metcalfes law thats not everyone elses fault!  


The value of a network goes up as number of users goes up, so the value of Bitcoin is proportional to number of users.  
     
Bitcoin has the utility value of *being able to transact with others on a network with certain valuable properties*. Think of it as buying space on a phone network. With fewer users, airtime would be less useful/valuable. As there are more users, that airtime has more value.  
  
You are not buying shares of a company, so dont compare it to that. You are buying a network based currency. Sorry if thats not simple enough for you, I cant see that broader analogies will stay true to reality.    
 
Now that said, it becomes very hard to put a price on it per coin as "one bitcoin" is an arbitray measurement, but I feel it will be directly related to the amount of funds flowing in to Bitcoin at any given time vs the funds flowing out. At some point it will find an equilibrium, that is the price at that point in time. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:18:21
yeah its increasingly likely that Tether is a big issue here   
Google "auditor quit" and the only results are cases where a) the auditor found falsified information and could not continue in good faith b) required information was not given, the reason for that 9 times out of 10 being that they were covering up some sort of accounting malpractise.  
Crypto needs to wean itself off from Tether somehow or we will be under its shadow until it blows up. Even if they prove they have done nothing wrong, without drastic changes this can happen again in the future too. Tether needs to go.

It's possible, but if you are sick it's perfectly possible that it will clear up on its own. However, it's often wise to get it checked out, and treated. The whole reason Bitcoin exists is because while it's perfectly possible that banks, institutions and governments will never rip people off in future, it's better to not have to trust them. "Don't trust, verify" is very much at the core of bitcoins philosophy.     
Whatever you think the extent of the effects will be on the market or not, we should agree that Tether is a cancer on the whole system and we should cut it out

A radical new product? Its a token, a gift voucher, an entry in a database with a corresponding bank balance. You might be confused by terms like "Omnitoken" but I and others certainly aren't. Qualified auditors/accountants will tell you that checking over such a simple business set-up should be a very simple task. A business with 1000s of different liabilities, offices worldwide, operating under several jurisdictions with millions of staff and hundreds of thousands of products can be audited successfully, so auditing Tether would be so easy it's laughable that you use that in their defence. Honestly, I'm laughing at that right now.     
Back to the more interesting part of your question. How can Tether change to satisfy me?   
They would need to be auditable by anyone at any point in time, which is frankly unrealistic unless the funds were split over a number of transparent public accounts which I do not believe is possible, yet. I don't believe there is any room in the marketplace for a company like Tether, who can just print however much cash they want and expect the market to just "trust them" instead of verifying what they say is true.    
Why do you trust them? They wouldnt trust you...

you will not lose any bitcoins by just holding them in an exchange or wallet or anything else. BUT, if you hold them in a wallet like electrum (not an exchange or online wallet) then you will receive a NEW type of coin too, bitcoin GOLD or the S2X coin, for each hardfork.  
You can then sell those for more REAL bitcoin, or keep them or whatever.   
So basically, should at least have them in your personal wallet, not a website

@_date: 2018-02-08 13:32:19


I think thats close but not quite accurate. I'd say, that in other words he is saying; banks have not shown interest in holding crypto-curencies specifically, but the introduction of derivatives may mean banks will hold positions in them as they are on the same platforms and baskets that banks currently trade on. Its not that they will *accidentally* hold positions against their will, its that they could hold a position in crypto for similiar reasons they hold positions in any other derivative.       
His keeping an eye on that is presumably to make sure it happens according to regulation, ie no manipulation, fraud or misselling.     


Im not sure what he means by that. If you are implying that by "entirely speculative" he means they have zero actual value, then I would say that's probably not what he means. I think he means their *current prices* are based on speculation, as in there is not one fairly priced currency of which the price is an accurate representation of its *current* usage only. Therefore, its price is based on speculation. So he can believe that the currencies have value/utility, but still believe that the current prices do not represent current usage, and are based on speculation instead.   
Hope that makes sense

yeah he's totally wrong, it's nowhere near a win-win situation (sorry legalgreyarea). Its very clearly win-lose as he could lose up to 90% of his stake quite easily if 2X coin is worth 10% of BTC as BCH was (and thats being optimistic on behalf of 2X)
He *could* hedge the bet quite easily as there are no shortage of people willing to take drastically less favorable odds thenhe is for this wager EG. receive 50 2X coins for every 100 BTC wagered, in which case he could arbitrage the bet and win either way. He is a shrewd cookie though and would probably be able to see that any hedging would be forfeiting a great deal of value on his bet.

I know you were yeah, but the topic of conversation here is what was said at the Breaking Bitcoin event, and whether it is proof of anything. It wasnt, and to say it was is a lie. We need to fight lies with truth, not fight lies with more lies. Otherwise what the hell are we fighting for.

I have read that thread. I agree with everything he says. But I also agree that people should not take it *too* seriously. They are his opinions. They are my opinions too, but they are opinions.  
Bitcoin is a honeybadger and dont give a fuck about opinions. If 2x wins out it wins out. I really dont think 2x will go anywhere, like with 99% certainty (and I say this as someone who has also "been in bitcoin from 2014" so take that as seriously as you want too I suppose) BUT what matters is the economic forces, not opinions. Not even facts about the big players matter. Economics and game theory do.

You are 100% correct. People take a guesstimate by trying to gauge who might buy how much... You have your multi-millionaires who may have $50k worth each as a portfolio hedge so add those up, then the average joe will hold say $100 x 500 million people perhaps so add that up, etc etc  
Then you divide the total by how many bitcoins you think still exist at that point (max 21 million if you assume none have been lost forever) and that gives you the total price per coin.  
Its a very rough science though and no one answer is much better than the next!

Guilty as charged. I knew it might have been interpeted like that but I was pushed for time and just left it how it was. I honestly didnt mean it personally, sorry.     
I was really just poking fun at the phrasing you used "I’m highly skeptical that Craig S Wright is truly Satoshi Nakamoto", as if there's a chance but you're just on the side of it not being him. All evidence suggests strongly, pretty much without a doubt, that he is just a conman. His claims are ridiculous and all evidence he produces falls down under scrutiny as forged.

@_date: 2017-09-07 16:33:04
where stability is reached depends on where you think the top is though, its circular reasoning :)  
It all depends on how much money gets spent and held in bitcoin at at one time, 1 mill per coin was projected value if it becomes very intrinsic in global economics and pretty much beats out the USD if I remember rightly.   
Where we are present day in relation to % adoption up to $250k seems doable. That would put market cap at only ~5 trillion, "only" around 60 times higher than currently
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:02:20
If you want to secure your bitcoin beyond trusting it to a third party, you need multiple backups, in multiple locations, perhaps with none being sufficient alone to compromise your wallet. They need to be secure against hacking, burglary, fire or flood. The only places to keep it currently are unregulated, immature facilities with a history of being compromised.     
That meets my criteria of 'difficult', does it not meet yours? Bitcoin is basically a bearer bond, but less secure in that it can be duplicated or stolen remotely. It is effectively no easier to store than gold, besides being smaller per lb/oz/kg

"It's likely we'll have larger blocksizes. But certainly not at the rate that bitcoin cash people want. "   
That's fine by me. The Core side of the debate has, to the best of my knowledge, been that the blocksize will increase, but conservatively, cautiously with respect that changes would be very difficult to reverse.   
This thread is to see what sort of response people here would give to the question though. I want to know what the average reader here believes. It seems to be "no more increases, ever"

I should have said how investing via Robinhood does not afford you any investor protections. An ETF would enable people to invest in BTC using for example their pension or retirement funds without having to gamble on the future of Robinhoods security. In that way, it increases investor safety. It improves general accessibility of investing in Bitcoin, which as you said before, is a qualifying factor for granting an ETF

I'm not really disagreeing, much!    
    
The hashrate didnt go that crazy btw   
   
You would be hard pushed to pick the date it hit 5800 from that graph. The %s of hashrate change are not what one would expect if the majority of miners were dropping off, the majority of China and also much of the rest of the world.        
But I'm really just saying the actual cost of mining in china is not easily ascertained from published utility rates. If anything I would expect them to be much lower, given Chinas style of doing business, and several other factors

@_date: 2018-07-27 18:46:47
There's nothing there to really disagree with either of us though.   
It says many miners operate at a cost of $8k per bitcoin. At the time of that article, it was just hitting 8k, and many miners (most likely those same ones who pay $8k per coin) were turning off their hardware. So they turned their machines off pretty much straight away, suggesting I might be right.       
Other miners pay less than $8 per coin, and those, most likely, did not turn off their machines, explaining why there are still people mining    
The majority of Bitcoin mining is done by professionals or managed pools who would absolutely stop the momen it became unprofitable.

If you are saying that the majority of miners would mine at a loss, then I respectfully disagree.   
Historic hashrate dips, or lack of, arent worth much in this debate as the price has not gone low enough to reliably conclude anything. I think the majority of miners know where their break even point is and actively manage their miners.

It's not childish when you consider what is being fought over. Companies normally have regulation protecting the brand from being diluted. Decentralised products and the self-appointed protectors of those brands have no means of protecting names, they rely on social compliance, which means social manipulation, which means a whole bunch of seemingly petty stuff like troll accounts, disinfo campaigns, name-calling and so on.

I think theres an important differentation to be made. Forking should definitely be encouraged I agree. However, deceptive practices should not. What Ver is doing by calling BCH Bitcoin is an idealistic land grab which is fine imo, if it were the only consequence. He is doing it in a way though which can confuse and mislead people, which some could argue is fraud when he has a personal stake in it's adoption. It's like if someone forked Linux, and stood to make money on each install. If that person called the real Ubuntu something else on their website Ubuntu.com and called their fork "the real Ubuntu", people would say it was scammy. Thats my gut reaction to what he is doing by misrepresenting the names without a prominent disclaimer on the site along the lines of "Most people call BTC the real Bitcoin and BCH Bitcoin Cash, we believe that BCH is the real Bitcoin and BTC is a bankster scam"

have to concur. Seems great oppurtunity to buy
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:47:38
I dont know why youre being downvoted. This seems immature and contrary to the NYA agreement which everyone seems to agree should be kept to. This proposed edit should be discussed by all sides instead of pushed/sneaked/campaigned through from out of the blue

They have crippled withdrawals, making it impossible for people to get their BTC out before a split. To then turn around and say they wont be giving people their forked coins is OUTRAGEOUS and Im surprised there isnt more being said about this obvious conflict of interest between resolving account issues in a timely manner and holding onto peoples coins as long as possible

My worry is that Jihan will continue to attack the network using whatever methods he can in an attempt to make BBC look like the better option. Isnt he actually capable of a 51% attack already, once you take into account all the pools he owns/holds a majority in?
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:55:39
yeah, with amounts under 2k Im not having a problem, but a lot are if they switch IP a lot or just randomly. Not lifting the limits is a good way of stopping whales from withdrawing though, there is no reason my verification and EVERYONE elses should take over 3 whole flippin months :P

our survey said :  
Top answer :)  
Accepting bitcoin would give them more profit. 
One factor is that it can be quite hard to open a new amazon account and place an order for things like gift cards or e-delivery goods these days due to all the fraud checks. I know, I have tried to buy a gift card for my sister using a debit card on a new account. It was a nightmare, they ended up cancelling my order. With bitcoin, you have 99.99% certainty there is no fraud going on.  
I am totally with you that in its current form though, it is basically useles for this. The fees are just too damn high, for both the customer and the retailer when converting back to fiat. If those fees could be reduced, and waiting times no longer than an hour or so for procesing, then its a strong competitor for fiat in terms of customer experience and retailer fraud prevention

fair response :) 
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:11:42
ELI5 what this means for BTC please
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:23:10
volatility isnt a problem really. Its fees and and big companies being slow to implement big changes
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:00:50
thats another method theyre using then. They started this several months ago, many suspect they are short on funds. Enhanced verifications have been taking 4 months+++, which is outrageous. Without that, you cannot withdraw more than 2k per day. A lot of people hold a lot more than that in their Polo accounts after the boom of early '17

Im doing the same as you. Im a young father with some stashed in a buy to let property and an emergency fund. Im actually over 50% in crypto... I can see a lot of good reasons which to me make typical investment advice obsolete. This is a paradigm shift in the making. It is like we are investing in the internet at a time when its still uncool to go online.
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:21:29
false. There are technologically more advanced coins, but there is technologically more advanced money than paper money. Look where we are though
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:12:42
100% assumptions

by controlling as much of the development and implementaion of the ""open source"" project as possible. Its quite simple logically tbh. Eg openoffice runs on linux. If you take over linux, you would be able to force the hand of openoffice developers.

This sort of rhetoric is stupid and everyone is only continuing it because they have done so for the past 3 years and don't realise it is time to STOP.  
Aug 1st is approaching and there is no need for the divide any more, both sides of the debate have drawn their lines and what will happen will happen. Continuing to attack the middleground is damaging BTC as a whole
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:51:24
I agree. People are just trying to take sides and throw shit at the other. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 02:23:41
fightin talk
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:00:53
I agree, Both sides have become riddled with immaturity and mud slinging. It should be intelligent debate, its more like toddlers squabbling. It just seems to be the american way of doing things though to be honest, pick a side and bash the others skull with whatever you can find
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:37:01
hes looking out for you bud, the expression "dont give a shit" could reasonably be taken for "zero interest whatsoever in knowing anything about it"

bad answer, evey single successful company or business or even wealthy individual minimises their tax exposure in whatever legal ways possible
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:55:51
I know yes, and perhaps it is true of chinese message boards too... but all the mud slinging is coming from well-versed english commentors.

some of the most honest, yet useful investment advice ever written on anything anywhere

ITs funny too because everyone knows that Jihan will continue with the blustering until his back is against the wall as with LTC.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:11:38
nope, bitmain drawing line in sand on blog post. "We aint afraid of no split"

if the funds were deemed to be highly likely to be present beyond reasonable doubt and were also classed as a terrorist threat, they could feasibly just waterboard you for a few years yeah
