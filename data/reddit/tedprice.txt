I think it's reckless. 
I keep my tax-sheltered retirement accounts in boring big companies (I am still losing to the S&amp;P dang it!). However I am lucky enough to max them out and still have cash on hand. So I have a biased opinion.
I think you will be kicking yourself if you don't seize this opportunity and go with your gut. This is an opportunity for you to get to retirement faster or at least put more away than you would have.
What I would suggest if you have the risk-tolerance:
Take out what you can afford to lose, right now, put it in BTC and on a hardware wallet so that you don't panic sell.
Immediately, reduce your lifestyle expenses and start replenishing your 401(k) or IRAs -- if you can.
Downside: you lose your money that can be replenished through working harder or taking extra jobs on the side or cutting your lifestyle back for some time.
Upside: you get life-changing money
Hope this helps and I am not trying to be a dipshit know-it-all. Honest question, honest answer.

I think that what you are missing is that this is the Goliath to bitcoins David. This is the title shot we have been waiting for. If the united States confronts bitcoin but is ineffective in shutting it down the US will need to deal with Bitcoin through legitimizing it, recognizing it as not a fad or fake or thin air but a first rate first class citizen in the global economy. Its an acknowledged threat to the US reserve status. Now lets see if its as impervious to government censorship and control as we say it is. Lets see if the holders hold.

(bias: I have some bitcoin)
I bought a gift for my niece on Amazon today.
1. I opened a credit card account
2. Then I waited 2 weeks to get the credit card
3. Then I verified the credit card over the phone
2 weeks! I went to Amazon.com, found a gift and went to make the purchase:
1. Then I entered a random 16 digit number
2. Then I added an expiration date
3. Then I added a random CVC number
4. Then I added my address, required to verify the credit card
5. I made the purchase
[Of course it's not that simple, Visa takes over and does some heavy lifting]
1. This transaction takes 3 days to settle. After 3 days, the charge shows up on my credit card.
2. I am able to pay my balance, but how? Oh right I connect my checking account.
3. After adding my checking account I can pay the balance. This takes an additional 3 days for the transaction to settle.
Man, oh, man. This is....we are....this credit card stuff is hal9000.

So you are calling my comment stupid then clarifying you don't fully understand my comment on inflation. We are doomed.
You seem like a nice kid who may care to learn so here go.
If bitcoin hit's 100K or 1M, it's not going to do so because institutions and sovereign governments thought "lets dump all of our money into bitcoin to make all the kids on Reddit rich!" It's going to be because of global economic upheaval, which will most certainly include a new economic world order, which will include......debasing the dollar and...inflation.

I respectful disagree with almost all of this. And most of the disagreement comes in the form of fractional reserve banking, the debasing of currency, and how loans are made and to whom they are made.
bitcoin has to be explained as much as fiat has to be explained. it's all based on trust and the eagerness of the holder to learn.

I don't know what a "scam app" is.
So... with regards to digital payments, I think I have just become numb to how bad the experience is. Every time I want to pay a babysitter, there is cash (which is great) or "I can pay you with paypal/google pay/apple pay/venmo/square cash/zelle" -- that is terrible. 
They all transfer the exact same thing...dollars. Where did we go so wrong here? While btc/lightning is one more app to have, it at least offers a bit of sanity: any wallet can send monies to any wallet -p2p- because the underlying protocol is the same.
Can you, at least, appreciate this sentiment?
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:03:16
This is true. 
I guess my contention is that, to get an apples-to-apples comparison, I would like to see Venmo be able to transfer money to Square Cash or Google Wallet. That won't happen for obvious reasons and I am not suggesting they should. What I am saying is that the walled-garden approach is not good. We are left to use a confederation of dollar-wallets, that still require us to authenticate our identity take a couple days to connect ACH accounts and 3 days to settle withdrawals. You would think Zelle would be a no-brainer winner-take-all for this reason but banks... go figure.

I didn't respect the stablecoin, but had a change of heart. Stablecoins, in some form or another, will have to have an important role to play in Bitcoins future. They must.
I was, at least at one time, a very rigid goldbug libertarian. But the reality of, say, a gold backed currency is that price fluctuations might be erratic. In very real terms, I could walk into the store to buy a gallon of milk, it could be $2 when I enter the store, then someone tweets ;D, and it's $10 buy the time I get to the checkout. And what about salaries? Stable prices and stable coins will connect the global currency to the local currency.
Having said that, I went from being a goldbug to a bitcoin maximalist and I am very keen on it's future. We just need to convince the rest of the world of its power. ;)

"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private" -- That means anywhere the U.S. government has jurisdiction, the dollar must be accepted as legal tender. It cannot be refused. I know, airplanes only take "plastic" for in-flight purchases, but the dollar is still the dollar. 
See the comments below. You are correct the government won't give you anything tangible because it's not a commodity currency. I know that we are getting into the weeds.
This isn't an apples-to-apples comparison, but these fiat currency -- many times -- reach for arguments and make claims that are not based in reality. Can you imagine if you and I signed a contract and I said: "that contract means nothing, it's just a piece of paper." I would be right in my head. And then I would be prosecuted.
In the math, I trust.

"Since fiat currencies are not backed by anything, even gold anymore..."
This is not true.
Fiat (read "by decree") currencies are back by the governments that issue them.
Commodity currencies are currencies pinned to an underlying commodity like gold or silver.
Bitcoin is not backed by anything either. 
Liberty Dollars (which were illegal confiscated by the us govt a decade ago) were private issue soars backed by gold.
I am big on bitcoin, believe in the s2f theory, etc. But we have to approach this matter with a honesty.
The U.S. dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Its purchasing power may rise and fall, and it can be printed out of thin air, but that doesn't mean it isn't backed by anything. When "faith and credit" disappear (see Zimbabwe) then it is backed by nothing.

Bezos ain't silly. The first thing he would do is buy up all the bitcoin under $50000. Then he'd make the announcement and dump said coin.

Its not needed. However, it certainly did well in establishing itself as an alternative coin with a solution, however dubious, to the extremely high fees last year. Coopting the bitcoin name also helped and Roger is quite the promoter. Its not going anywhere.
It could also be said that a lot of altcoins may lose their purpose with the introduction of side chain and future n layer tech built on top of the bitcoin blockchain

My attention is piqued.
What's the practical difference and econ consequence betwixt bit.wage taking my monies from a contracting job and buying btc?
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:26:40
3 Steps:
1. Install Square cash, use it to buy Bitcoin.
2. Get a ledger Nano S
3. Transfer Bitcoin from your phone to your Nano using the easy to use instruction provided by each service.
4. Store Ledger in a $50 fire proof gun safe; split up your 12 key words, tattoo 6 on your 3 year old's left arm, the other 6 on your 1 year old's right leg.
There is always someone that accuses me of shilling Square. It's cool. But really: Jack Dorsey is a champion of Bitcoin and Square cash is a legit service that doesn't cost any fees in or out. "Conbase" (narf!) is not a friend of BTC, charges fees, etc.

This is the only place we should be buying. I was called a shill the other day but the jack dorsey is a Bitcoin maximalist and its free to buy and withdraw bitcoin from the cash app.

There is absolutely zero benefit to anyone involved. Zero. It would be a sacrifice for the sake of "priming the pump," getting people to use their bitcoin over lightning network.
I know about Bitrefill and the vouchers -- I guess that is a better option... you saved me a lot of dev time ;D
Chicken and egg:

Not to go down the "link or it didn't happen" rabbit hole on this one however, I was told that "some banks" are not allowing customers to store their bitcoin keys -- not wallet keys -- in bank vaults. It essentially dovetails with the universal "no storing cash in a bank vault."
In practice, you go into the vault, the vault usher leaves you alone, and you can do whatever you want. In this particular podcast, the interviewee was opening a new vault. The the manager said: "what do you plan to store in the vault?" the response was "bitcoin keys" the bank said: "nope no cash or cash equivalents", so the interviewee responded something like "body parts of my victims" and the bank was like: "I suggest two vaults."
