And if everyone did this we would abandon Fiat which was entirely the point years and years ago.

I bought it because




Both are tech or politics depending on how you want to look at it.


I would guess most BTCers who have HODL do believe in technology and a BTC future.

Thats perfect.
Thats the goal.

Cryptomania has taken hold, so people are mining shitcoins that will be dead by the end of the year.
When those die, you will probably have a significant population that will stay away from crypto forever. Not a big deal because those are cryptosuckers that fell for TRON, LTC or some BS ICO. They didnt plan on using the crypto, so its no loss to the community.
I expect only ~3 major cryptos used by companies, BTC(reserve rare currency), a smart gen 2 coin(like ETH), and a untracable coin(like XMR). There might be more, but they will probably have niche usecase like USDT or Binance coin. 
Computing power for BTC mining will probably increase, but will have major mining facilities.
ETH/Gen 2 might be able to make use of computers not doing anything, but they would need to provide value outside of currency.
I dont expect mining to continue like it is forever, we are in this explosion where everyone is placing bets and seeing what happens. Once the money for shitcoins dries up, I expect mining to change considerably.

I was thinking you probably only need 1 of those screens hooked up to a decent laptop to mine something. If you have access to thousands, and the computers are all different, some might be useful while others are running windows XP.

Maybe all currency is flawed, Fiat seems the worst, 4%+ inflation a year?
I'll take deflation as a peasant. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:05:36
Speak for yourself. My buddies and I trade it nearly exclusively.

What is the solution for a house fire that destroys your wallet and your backup keys?
Thats why I have my money in multiple exchanges.

Gold was essentially deflationary and it was used for 2000 years.
Yes you cant pump an economy up with inflation like you can with fiat, but whats wrong with saving money? Economists tell me that saving money is bad, but thats for the macro economy. What about myself?

OKay, I'll try, but I'll probably ditch this account before 2020 since privacy and stuff
"Anarcho Capitalist predicts that Bitcoin will reach $55,000 by 2020."
I expect 2018 to be a meh year for Bitcoin never breaking 20k, and awful for Alt Coins. 2019 will be the year alt-coiners change to Ethereum.
However the hard fork to POS causes ETH to lose its gigantic 2nd place hold. BTC will be safer than the divorce for weak hands. This will happen AFTER the ETH fork when they realize its worse than any BTC hard fork.
For the 12 year in a row, Alt coins die, HODL Bitcoin only.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:37:01
When alt coins start to die(which they ALWAYS do), people will convert to BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:07:04
Whatever you get paid for this week, you put that USD conversion into BTC.
Or whatever % your finances can handle.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:11:25
Its still super new. Give it a few more years. Only last month did we find out the US wasnt going to ban bitcoin.

I agree.
Bitcoin is rare and the entire world values it.
USD? 2% inflation? Whod you ask? The government? bahahhahahaha (4%+)
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:16:42
Hes wrong, but if you want to see why we trust Bitcoin only, compare that to Litecoin, Shitcoin Cash, and DOGE. 
Bitcoin is distributed the best of any.

Anyone want to do reddit investigating, this comment thread seemed a bit negative for reddit
This user in particular gets upvotes despite constant shitposting(and comparing bitcoin to tulips)
I completely expect russian style propaganda machines on crypto to spread FUD and spread Pump.

Europe is a bit outdated on tech. They are all style and tradition.
To explain, I work in the tech sector and Europe is far behind. There are a few niche industries they excel(or excelled) like Processed Food and Communication services, but between Auto and Tech, the companies have poor reputation. A brand name fabric from an Italian company refused to increase the width needed for a new application. As a result, we went to a competitor who would. 
We wanted the brand name, but the application was more important.
You can see this in European Autos as well. Lots of pretty interiors, tech is low.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:08:51
Saw your post history and compared it to Tulips...
"misunderstand" huh?
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:06:01
Replenish it?
I dont mind spending bitcoin, but I also put more USD into it later.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:27:38
Oh grandpa, you should google Federal Reserve, Inflation, Fiat Currency.
Then, when you understand why we trust rare numbers more than government corruption, google
Layer 2 cryptocurrency, Coinbase, Lightning Network

Why? I havent seen almost any bugs in weeks? (can someone link me pls?)
Plus, after blowing 0.15 delicious Bitcoin on a pump and dump shitcoin, I'd much rather play around with BTC than waste money day trading alts.
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:31:23
I agree, and I think thats why Gold didnt inflate to infinity.
Bitcoin is currently solving a money transfer problem and an inflation issue. 
Once the value for bitcoin raises to 100k or 1m+, fluctuation will be mere percentages.
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:33:39
LTC legit?
What on earth would make you say that?
It was dead until the coinbase insider trading pump. 
It has all the flaws of Bitcoin and none of the rarity. Why would you take LTC seriously?
@_date: 2018-07-03 13:45:28
Does anyone think blockchain tech is actually awful?
  
More expensive, slow, and there is no room for forgiveness.
Bitcoin (and currencies) need this verification, but for apps, people do not want to pay. We trust centralization. Heck, not even bitcoiners care that much, look at coinbase.

This is the easiest buy of my entire life. I cant even short Tesla because bitcoin is such an easy buy.

But if its internal, that removes the trust, and that was the entire purpose of paying the validators.
@_date: 2018-07-03 15:21:55
That was my point, I dont think there is a use.
