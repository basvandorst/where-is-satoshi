*Just my hypothesis*
We are waiting for the Bitcoin guardians to stop selling bitcoins. 
Back in early 2014 when the price of bitcoin went from $200+ to $1,200 over a 4 months' period, the guardians decided to step in to prevent Bitcoin from attracting too much attention from the regulators. Should the guardians did nothing then, Bitcoin might have been banned outright for fear of disrupting, even replacing the present financial system. 
When will the guardians stop selling bitcoins? When regulatory environment becomes clearer not just in New York but everywhere else in the major financial centres.

* Choose a better title. There is no mention of ECB or Euro in your text anywhere.
* Bitcoin can be a store of wealth. In Greece's situation, bitcoin is well suited for Greeks. But there are a number of practical problems for the man-on-the-street. 1. What is bitcoin? 2. Where to buy bitcoin? 3. Where to store bitcoin? 4. How to convert bitcoin back to the currency of the day?
* But undeniably, awareness of Bitcoin has grown. We will see a price increase. We will see more Greek adoption. We will see mainstream media reports. We will see further awareness. We will see further adoption around the world.
* But until the day comes when Bitcoin is as easy to use as cash or credit card, the use of bitcoin for daily payment transaction will continue to be elusive.

To be more precise, you are referring to the Greek central bank. However, I assume you know that the ECB has resumed that power?
Now, transitioning to Bitcoin removes monetary policy from **everyone**. With that, no party can manipulate monetary policy because they can't and so, government will wholeheartedly use fiscal policy to improve the economy. 
The problem with monetary policy is that economists think they know best. But from past records, this is not so. Therefore, monetary policy should be the least of all policies.

First off, in order to use blockchain as a recording system for smart contract etc, you need to create a transaction which will expend a small amount of bitcoin. In order for blockchain to work and continue working, you need good miners. By good miners, I mean miners who profit by protecting Bitcoin. That means that they do not intend to engage in 51% attack even if they have significant hash power. Regardless, the price might need to increase so that more could be invested in the hashing power to protect the network. When large institutions start to use blockchain, they will want a network which is secure. Many measure security by hashing power, I think it may also make sense to consider bitcoin market capitalization, which in turn determines how much investment will be made in the mining hardware.
Bitcoin is also money. So you can record an item in blockchain and transfer its ownership to another person, while at the same time demanding payment for that item through wire transfer for example, or you can transfer the value via bitcoin. The benefit of doing so might not be obvious now but when bitcoin as money becomes more popular and acceptable, it will happen naturally. So I do not see a distinction between the 2 different groups of users you mentioned eventually.

Frankly, no one knows why the price of Bitcoin has been on the decline. What we do know is that Bitcoin as an ecosystem has been strengthening. You see new applications coming up everyday, with VC funding at an all-time high.

This is the problem. The max discount merchants can give is the credit card processing fee, which stands at 2-3% currently.

@_date: 2014-09-01 01:39:18
The sad fact now is that there is no real incentive for consumers to pay using bitcoin. They will be better off paying via credit cards, in view of rebates and fraud protection. Instead of merchants eating the whole pie, it makes sense for consumers to have part of the pie. It will inevitably grow the pie itself, since more merchants and consumers alike see the cost saving benefit of bitcoin as a payment method, and thus jump onto the bandwagon. 
I have started a project on Bitcoinstarter for this cause:  The project is waiting for moderation at the moment. 
I hope I can do something to increase bitcoin adoption via this project.

Suppose all transactions take place in the blockchain, there will be tax events and non-tax events. Whether or not it is a tax event will depend on the regulation. If an individual sells another individual an item, it may not be taxed. If a business sells an individual an item, it may be taxed. Both transactions are recorded in the blockchain. What a tax office will need to do is to differentiate tax transactions from non-tax transactions. Today, the blockchain does not support that. It does not mean that the blockchain cannot be modified in future to support that.

Today, businesses can understate their revenue and get away with it because they can choose not to record a transaction even though it had taken place. If the transaction had taken place in blockchain, the record will be there and no one can modify it. This is the point. The tax office can then use the blockchain to check against the declared income. 
You are right when you say that there are non-tax events in the blockchain. That's why there may be a need to differentiate between tax and non-tax transactions. How to do that? A transaction will need to be tagged, whether taxable or non-taxable. It can be done in the blockchain itself, or maybe as a sidechain project, or maybe an addon to the blockchain. Clearly, more thoughts are needed on this.

10 years ago, Peter had the vision of creating a global common digital currency. He failed. Today, bitcoin is on track to achieving this vision. Yet, Peter does not think that it will succeed. Coming from a man who shared the vision he had, it will be wise to listen what he has to say.
There were 2 reasons he gave: (1) The current payment system sucks; and (2) Relative to the dollar, bitcoin does not have the status of the world's reserve currency and is not backed by the US military supremacy. For (1), it is improving everyday. The world's finest brain is working on it, the problem is clear and the solution keeps getting better. For (2), if bitcoin is backed by people's will, wouldn't it be better than the military? If the majority of the people back it, it naturally becomes the world's reserve currency. Case in point - Gold is not backed by the military and it is valuable because everyone thinks it is.

Inflation and an increase of monetary supply are not the same.

Not a meaningful comparison, I would argue. 
Organisations have been using their private systems and opening up their access to other authorised organizations. Enter bitcoin and the *blockchain technology*. Suddenly, everyone is alerted to the hype. But they cannot live with a decentralised system. Hence, the concept of a private blockchain.
IMO, the more meaningful comparison should be between existing private systems and the private blockchain.

First, realise that wealth is an abstract concept. In the past, wealth is represented by how many cattles you own for instance. Today, it is more about how much you own in real estates, stocks, gold and collectibles.
Enter bitcoin. Add bitcoin to the list above. 
Does it change wealth/income inequality? Early adopters are rich now but are they richer than Bill Gates and Warren Buffett? In the long term if bitcoin does enter mainstream, will investors not buy bitcoin and keep it as one of their assets? Will bitcoin replace any of the assets as mentioned before?

I did not say so. In fact, I do not consider blockchain to be an efficient database.


Best for someone in the financial sector, specifically in the securities area to answer this. 


If you have only a single database to manage, sure. If there are multiple databases, and each database belongs to a separate entity, synchronisation becomes a problem. I say my database is correct, you say your database is correct, so whose database is correct? Is that reliable? I do not think also that commercial databases are more secure than blockchain. How much does it take for an external hacker to steal data? How much does it take for an insider to amend data? Comparatively, how much does it take for data in the blockchain to be changed?

All valid. Would be sensible to consider if they are show-stoppers or potentially get better over time. Also, consider if the current currency (for bitcoin) and/or recording system (for blockchain) is superior or inferior to Bitcoin. If inferior, the Bitcoin show will go on; if superior, Bitcoin will die naturally.

Using blockchain for donation purpose certainly promotes transparency, an attribute welcomed by charity organisations. The point to consider is: At what cost?
Is it feasible for ALL donations to go through the blockchain? If no, the most likely scenario is that donations recorded on blockchain will only be for bitcoin donations, which at current stage constitutes only a small portion of total donations.
Nevertheless, good to highlight the transparency aspect for charity organisations. Added one more reason to include bitcoin channel for accepting donations.

Fact: The Chinese controls the majority of hash power currently.
Does this mean measures should be implemented to crub their influence? I don't think so. What happens if another country controls the majority of hash power tomorrow? Do the same thing again? 
I agree there should be measures but they should not be country or miner specific. They should be targeted against hashing power, i.e., exploring ways to change the Bitcoin protocol such that no single entity is able to control a % of total hashing power. For example, given that F2Pool today controls 21%, can that figure be restricted to 1% by changing the protocol? Likewise, no other miners should control more than 1%. In addition, miners should not be able to collaborate to combine their hashing power. But we can allow a single legal entity to form multiple mining entities, subjected to the maximum hashing rate rule.

* Obviously, you will want to have some bitcoin. If Bitcoin is to succeed, bitcoins will increase in value.
* If you have so much money to burn, buy yourself an island and build the required infrastructure to demonstrate the feasibility of Bitcoin, as a payment system, as a currency, as a record management system, etc. So for payment system and currency, you will need to have a small town where the participants in the community transact mainly with bitcoin. For record management system, you will play the role of a government registering proofs of ownership and arbitraging disputes. 
* I am sure there are other uses for Bitcoin and bitcoins. The more informed ones can help me out.
* The key thing is to establish a jurisdiction free from existing control, and then you can run the experiment and demonstrate to the world the superiority of Bitcoin over existing mechanisms. With a billion, I believe you can do it.
* People interested in Bitcoin will flock to your island looking for inspirations and wanting to fulfill their ambitions. Your island will be a magnet attracting VC funds, bitcoin start-ups, top developers, top IT companies and eventually central banks observers.

You need a reference to understand bitcoin more effectively. Use USD as example.
Most of the USD in existence is in the form of a digital currency. They exist in the banks' database records. Only some of it in physical notes and coins. Comparatively, bitcoin is all digital.
Some people and institutions are into USD as investors and speculators. If they long USD, they hope the USD to appreciate against other currencies. Vice versa if they short USD. Similar to bitcoin.
USD is a widely accepted legit currency. Its volatility varies. Recently, it is quite volatile with the QEs and Financial Crisis. Bitcoin is not yet a widely accepted legit currency. Therefore, it is more volatile than the USD. When it becomes a widely accepted legit currency, it will be as stablized as the USD.

What Gordon Getty means is that the leverage by banks is the root problem. When you have fractional reserve and products like subprime which extends fractional reserve and obfuscate its fundamental basic value, what you are creating is a network of debts that keeps getting bigger until it inevitably bursts. No one knows when exactly but like all bubbles, it will burst.
Compare this to bitcoin where the M0 is fixed, I know that the bitcoins I have now are the bitcoins I have in future, i.e., its value will not be diluted at the whim of the central banks. To be clear, the so-called bitcoin banks can practise fractional reserve but I know that if they go bust, the value of my bitcoins will not be affected simply because bitcoins cannot be printed at will.
Simply put, today the central banks and the banks hold too much power by virtue of their ability to print money and lend out money they do not have. When things go wrong, the solution becomes more wrong. Bitcoin shifts the power back to the people.

It is also a mindset problem. He keeps on saying that Bitcoin can be copied and it is not backed by anything, and therefore it will not have value. He fails to understand value is determined by perception directly and technical capability indirectly. If people thinks that bitcoin has value, there will be a price for it. If people thinks that gold is worthless, gold will be worth 0. The reason that people thinks that bitcoin has value is because it solves a problem they have, like moving money at any time, any where. The only reason I can think of why people thinks gold has value is because everyone else thinks it has value and is shiny.

In Bitcoin, we have the blockchain and then we have the miners who are adding new blocks onto the blockchain, and then the blockchain is being downloaded and maintained by thousands of nodes. 
Before we get to the 51% attack, we need to establish the equivalent of the blockchain in the current financial system. And the answer is not straightforward because there is no single public ledger. There are multiple national level ledgers maintained by the central banks where only the highest level transactions are recorded. So can there be a 51% attack on these national level ledgers? Technically yes but practically almost no, because would the central bank hack themselves? Perhaps only in extreme case where the books need to be modified?

Again, the price is determined by demand and supply. Whether it will double, triple or remains the same, remains to be seen. 
If miners lose money, they will take some ASICs offline, and hashrate falls. And yes, security level lowers, and that is a bad thing. But we need to consider the threshold level of security or hashrate, below which, the network will be unsafe. I don't think anyone can come out with an accurate figure at present.

That said, it is good that the Bitcoin Foundation pays the core devs, so that there is an incentive for them to continue working on the code. (Hey, if you have received your pay check, you need to produce something, right?)
What if the core devs decide that they have had enough and decide to do something else? Then we should thank them for their contribution to Bitcoin and trust them to hand over the project to the new team. I don't think we need to worry about the new team because Bitcoin is open sourced and certainly it is bigger than the core devs. If individuals don't fill the gap, there will be companies stepping in because by then, their fortune would have depended on it.

Yes, if you have USD, you can withdraw USD. Trading has been stopped, so you can't trade alt coins for USD.

Good analysis and coming from Forbes. People, if you have not noticed, the sentiment from the media has pivoted. This means that we are no longer in the "laugh at you" stage. Time to stock up more bitcoins before everyone else does.

Ah... Sounds great!
But why is QR code the predominant payment method today? Why can't developers copy Apple Pay (not sure what technology they used) or Visa payWave (I believe they are using RFID)?

Halvings will be a problem to the miners if the price doesn't rise, in terms of profitability. It will not be a problem to the rest of us. 
But some have predicted the price will rise, because remember price is determined by demand and supply. When newly minted bitcoins half, supply lowers, and if demand remains the same, price will inevitably rise.
@_date: 2015-03-30 12:39:18
QR code is a clumsy way of making payment. Is it possible technically to have payment methods similar to Apple Pay or Visa payWave?
@_date: 2015-10-23 11:49:32
For people in front of the vending machine, better. 
For friends paying on behalf of the buyer, QR-code is better.

You are right to say that without devs, there is no Bitcoin. And yet, I will argue that **if there is Bitcoin, there will be devs**.
I don't track who have been actively contributing to the codes in GitHub. And yet, I recall that Andreas Antonopoulos in the 2014 Texas Bitcoin Conference said that if need be, he will amend the codes if Bitcoin comes under attack. Context: Someone asked him what would happen if there is a 51% attack.
I would not say that there is not exactly people lining up to code on the project. I would say that the spotlight tends to be on the *core* devs. This is not surprising, as with any given projects. **When someone recognises you as a core dev, it is more than a flattery, it is an acknowledgement of your standing in the bitcoin technical community.** With that, opportunities open and it becomes easier to be a CTO or the likes of a bitcoin (or alt coin) company.
No one says that the whole development team should step down. And no one can stop any core dev from stepping down. And when they do, I am saying that we need not worry about Bitcoin development. **If Bitcoin is indeed so fragil that when the core team is gone, the protocol collapses, then I say forget about Bitcoin, go back to fiat.**

Presumbly, the sender needs to send bitcoins to Wrte.io (which will then forward to the receiver after subtracting for a fee) before being able to send email to receiver successfully, which leads to a chicken-and-egg question.
Spammers will just ignore the email bounce-back message.
Most of the legitimate users will not understand they need to use bitcoins before sending email.
To be clear, it is a good idea. It is just that it is a little ahead of our time.

For a balance view, it should be noted that 


Instead of buying from Coinbase (the brokerage), you can buy from Coinbase (the exchange) which charges no trading fee now or Circle which has been free-to-use all along.

This. Somewhat unrelated, what if you are able to pay vending machines with bitcoins using QR code? No more coins, only mobile phone! If you run out of bitcoins, take a picture of the QR code, send it to your friend and ask for a favour to help pay for it.

Pardon me as English is not my native language.
Central banks can of course introduce as many QEs as they want. But it is meaningless because with each QE, fiat becomes more worthless. Gradually, people will use another currency and will ignore QEs.

If you think of bitcoin as gold, it's not hard to imagine the creation of paper bitcoin (or certificates) issued by financial institutions, which are not backed by bitcoins but the promise that they will honour its redemption, on terms dictated by themselves. Why people will prefer certificates rather than real bitcoins is beyond me at present.

I expect a deeper integration in their existing e-commerce platform with bitcoin than just superficial integration with BitPay or Coinbase. So this will take a longer time. 
When it is done, Amazon and Alibaba will pay attention and follow suit. And then, bitcoin will truly be mainstream. Beautiful.

I'm all for increasing the number of transactions per second but not increasing the amount of gabbage in the blockchain. People tend to put in unnecessary things into the blockchain if the size limit is increased.

The figures are probably exaggerated. The journalists took the number of investors claimed by the company and multiply by the maximum loss among the reported victims.
Furthermore, considering bitcoin market cap of $3 billion, it is hard to believe that $400 million is concentrated in an unknown HK company.

I've said before and I'm saying it again. Multi-Sig is not useful for personal wallet. If only you yourself own the coins, it does not make sense for multiple parties including yourself to sign transactions. It make sense for commercial wallet like exchanges though, where no single party own the stash.
@_date: 2015-02-14 05:10:43
What is striking is that the number of bitcoins accumulated has increased from 110,000 BTC a year ago to 135,000 BTC now, at the same time that the price has been dropping. This means that while demand is huge, supply is even more huge. What this graph does not tell us is where this supply comes from.

Paypal tried to create a world currency and they failed. Maybe Google will have better luck, who knows? But if Google creates Googlecoin, I hope it will not be felt like a slippery slope down the infinite currency warm hole. And what will stop some other qualified person from creating a currency similar to GoogleCoin?

By far, Tim Swanson is one of the best anti-bitcoin candidates for a debate with Andreas Antonopoulos. He knows the technical stuff and he can argue well, on paper and in person. It will be a blessing if indeed such a debate takes place.

The best deal for trading is CNY/BTC. 0 trading fee and minimal spread. OKCoin, BTCChina and Huobi. Not able to trade using USD is not an issue. You can always withdraw BTC and when you want to cash out, sell BTC in a USD exchange.
