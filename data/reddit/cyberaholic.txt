29!  
Today - the day when Bitcoin and Black Friday collide!  
P.S. I really want this mug! It's very cool! :)

Went through all the 3 links. Didn't understand what is the outcome of the analysis though.
Related note: I was a heavy user of CoinSecure since their prices were far lower than the other Indian exchanges at the time. I'd withdrawn my BTC holdings but left some INR in their wallet before this hack happened. Also, on a lark, I'd set up some trades to buy Bitcoin at a price that was far lower than the last low, thinking that in the off-chance it'd fall that low, I wouldn't mind picking up some more BTC.
As you might know, on April 6 2018, the Reserve Bank of India announced that all institutions under their influence (viz. banks) were to cease all relationships with cryptocurrency exchanges within the next 3 months. With that, the BTC market in India crashed, and crashed hard. My trades on CoinSecure got triggered, and my INR got converted to BTC.
I wasn't worried... I knew that I couldn't trust the GoI to make the right decisions when it came to bleeding-edge tech like BTC, so this wasn't too much of a surprise. What was surprising though, was that people were panicking... it was the first, and probably last time, in my life where I've seen the entire Indian market dumping BTC at a whopping 30-40% discount compared to the international price.
Also, I was a bit lazy... so I let the BTC stay in the CoinSecure wallet. Then the 13 April 2018 hack happened. Thousands of us realized that we'd been locked out of our accounts - there was no way to log in to even check our balance, let alone withdraw. However, to CoinSecure's credit, they were posting updates on their website - they informed about the developments, the police complaints, and to their full credit, their plan to make customers whole from this loss.
They emailed instructions to all their users, offered to pay us in INR for the BTC we had lost (based on their exchange's 13 Apr 2018 price), and gave a solid 45 window for us to sign &amp; courier documentation that absolved them of any further liability. I did my bit, and then after a couple of months, the money reached my bank account.
\*\*The silver lining?\*\*Even though I hadn't lost a lot of BTC, the money that came back to me was at a 20% profit compared to my buying price.
*P.S. If there was ever a time for this hack to have happened, it couldn't have happened at a better time for me, as I got saved coz of the RBI market crash and dollar cost averaging.*

20%? Nah, if he wants to be mentally prepared, consider 50% in 6 hrs.
You gotta feel your stomach drop, then learn how to NOT click on sell, and then slowly watch it recover over the next few days.

Ummm... think there are high chances he's not alive anymore.

Shouldn't take more than a few days for a storefront to set up a digital gateway to accept crypto.
And if those stores want to hold crypto, it takes 10 mins to put up a wallet address, and a form that lets you submit your sender wallet address and an order confirmation number.
