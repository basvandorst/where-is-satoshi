Its really simple. Look at the bearish moving averages!!!!
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:12:54
[ from Yesterday’s update]: If the 7-day EMA of $8,183 continues to act as support for Bitcoin, the next target to test will be the 200-day moving average, which currently resides at $8,585.
Breaking the 200-day moving average would provide Bitcoin with the ammunition required to rise to around $9,300- $9,400, although once it reaches this range we anticipate significant selling pressure to re-emerge.

Agreed although it’s not likely to fall so low. If it did, it would be a great opportunity!
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:43:49
And here comes the troll gang :D Mitch all you’re doing is showing everyone how sad, bitter and threatened you are.  And by the way, please stop misinforming everyone about bitcoin. At least we try to keep things real.

It’s sad you have to try to stalk people and you clearly can’t even do that properly. LOL!
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:01:02
Interesting. Thanks for sharing.  The math actually suggests a crazy floor to ceiling price of $22,000 - $162,754 sometime post May 2020 halving....let’s see... of course we don’t have a crystal ball ����‍♂️

@_date: 2019-10-16 19:00:02
Clearly... how ironic coming from you. Never mind. It’s not worth it. Good riddance! Please stop wasting time trolling people under different reddit accounts.

Very apologetic ‘voodoodog’... no pun intended

Jokes aside, your points carry some validity although saying TA is BS isn’t fair. TA is probably the most misunderstood art.  Many people lose money  because they follow TA blindly and because they don’t apply sound risk management principles.
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:43:59
And there you have it folks: BTC plummeted to a low of $9,653.
@_date: 2019-09-26 20:01:33
It’s called hedging and you should learn more about it!
@_date: 2019-09-18 19:14:10
Probably bitter because you have no clue how to apply TA. Don’t give up your day job Mark!
@_date: 2019-09-26 20:20:40
Shorting is risky if you don’t understand how to apply it or if you’re speculating... no doubt... but if you understand how to hedge your exposure, it won’t  matter whether bitcoin rises or falls.
