kinda but the ultimate goal would be hoarding as much as i can below the $500 price point.

if i win the whole sum of PowerBall, i will Dump 90% of that money into buying up as much Bitcoin i can possibly can. 
this would be a gift to all the holder of BTC and the future of BTC survival.
i only need 25 million to live happy ever after. PowerBall is at 1.5 Billion right now i believe.

Bitcoin wont be able to handle the massive inflow of new comers at its current state. there need to be something done so that Bitcoin perform more transaction per second.  
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:57:25

kinda of confusing me here, is this the money that the bank will use to start there own blockchain or whatever they gonna call it? 
 would this money be investment into Bitcoin itself?
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:01:34
do you know what it is?
@_date: 2016-01-14 02:23:22
i always feel that if I buy BTC and hold it. i am actually doing something good for humanity and people who were born in poor corrupted country.

if governments want to do 51% attack, they are not going to use current chip technology. they would want to develop there own or buy latest mining chip (s7 Ant miners). there is no way Antminer will sell them all the Mining they need to get 51% at one go. developing new chip technology on time, isnt so easy. any big government run project always tend to delay, takes longer and cost alot more than its suppose to. by the time they have those chips ready, difficulty wont remain the same. there will be newer mining chips in the market. 
the probably most easily way is to shut down Big mining farms. however you can not shut down everything, there will always be really big incentive for small mini unlicense farm that run in the peoples home. because the difficult came down due to big mining farms shut down. the more big mining farms get shut down, the bigger the incentive to mine bitcoin due to low diff.

open up a circle account as well, just in case. 
BTC reward halving to 12.5/block 
in 2016 June 23, Est. Time
@_date: 2016-02-09 03:42:15
i just use circle to buy and use Local Bitcoins to Sell. 
just to be in the safe side when you are unloading alot of BTC. we are talking about 100k + worth of BTC. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 18:15:21
even if there is a backdoor, you will need to physically have access to the trezor. however if it did got confiscated, all you need are the backup codes, you can transfer your funds out. so its a race against time. eveything shouldnt take more than 5min to do. 
Trezor is still much safer than a mobile phone. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:50:28
Only in the short term, in the long term that money is nothing. his 500 BTC holding would be worth way more than what the banks gave him. 
he will regert, BTC will succeed, we will moon so hard. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 20:20:44
its open source now, go on GitHub
@_date: 2016-02-18 03:59:42
like inflation is not enough to take away our wealth, now they have to add new tools to the game. like 
"Negative Interest Rates". 
@_date: 2016-02-06 06:08:26
Bitcoin is not an Altcoin, if an Altcoin like LTC get a PUMP before halving. BTC will definitely see one too, the only thing is it would be much bigger than before. 
a month before or so people gonna start hoarding like crazy. you can already see it now, the trader on BTCe is normally $10 cheaper than other exchange, just recently that the trader on BTCe dont want to dump theirs coins as much. which is why price is higher than other exchanges. all the traders are getting prepare for this epic once a 4 years pump.
@_date: 2016-02-08 02:43:33
alot of money gettting pouring in, because they believe in the future of BTC and these prices are very very cheap A.T.M.
@_date: 2016-02-09 03:49:34
like what?
i am using location bitcoins and circle right now. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:43:23
they got greedy and wanted to make more money
@_date: 2016-02-09 00:38:55
its does, you just have to think alittle harder. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 07:03:41
Trezor is way safer than your phone, it depend on how serious you are with your security. 
No backdoor in the Trezor, 
your phone have a BackDoor ( depends on model, make, etc)

Quitting BTC before 2016 halving isnt a smart idea. at least wait and see however thing play out before quit.
Year 2025:
Mike Hearn: 
yea i could of being really wealthy right now and retire early, if i were to hold my 500 BTC. 
however i choose to work for the banks and hold their stocks which i only see a 2-3x increase, and cont. to work for them up until i am 66yrs old. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 02:58:26
@_date: 2016-02-17 04:44:29
use both circle and coin-base, 
i heard people getting banned from selling BTC regularly on Circle. so my suggestion is to sell ONLY on Local Bitcoins. once circle ban you, you can not get back to circle anymore FOREVER. so be smart and reduced your risk of getting banned. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:07:32
its smarter to be patient and add on more to the collection than to take a big loss. 
if you looks like the history of BTC, Patient holder are rewarded nicely. just when everyone thinks BTC is dead in 2011, price gone nowhere for a 18-20months. BTC came back and became alot stronger than before. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 05:29:43
its a price for being invisible/under the radar.
@_date: 2016-02-20 01:09:17
they still accept Bitcoin. LOL
@_date: 2016-02-19 05:54:22
i see a bright Future for BTC because of Governments trying to Ban CASH and allow Banks to do Negative Interest Rates. 
that and 20% Off in amazon, Starbucks is more than enough to motivate people to Learn/Use BTC. 
@_date: 2016-02-14 19:12:45
you already see that in-effect within the last 24hrs.
Mike Hearn is not big enough to have an major negative effect on Bitcoin. 
if BTC hits "All Time High" in 2016 or 2017, Mike Hearn will look as dumb as Professor Bit-corn. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 01:51:16
Love the concepts, but dont know how to start downloading files and paying micropayment for uploaders, etc
wasnt easy to use, there was no "how to" or video to watch. 
so i was loss
@_date: 2016-02-09 00:41:45
i would hated if Coinbase win, because i am forever ban from Coinbase. which means i cant spent Bitcoin with the company accepting Bitcoin through Coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 03:30:42
anyone shorting BTC at these levels are insane
.thinking it will go back to $250 in 6months is pretty insane.
