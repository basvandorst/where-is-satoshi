Oh black friday, would it really dip for black friday?
Did it dip on black friday 2016?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:49:43
I'm just seeking advice, it's all over me after all :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:21:34
It's risky, i'm confused between "let's go for it" and "don't wanna work at McDonald's" ��
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:19:03
So what u recommend, to buy or w8?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:34:57
Hopefully it dips, I would buy immediately...
My fear is it continues growing.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:38:04
I'm completely ready, tomorrow I will deposit cash anyways, and decide to buy
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:31:23
That's exactly what my thoughts are
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:19:38
What would u do if u were in my shoes?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:41:28
The thing is that I freaked out it would go lower which was completely stupid
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:40:55
It was a bad experience 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:28:29
It would cost me more on fees...
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:28:55
I will wait till tomorrow anyways and decide
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:39:43
Reading this sentence only made my confusion worse.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:44:40
So would BTC go lower on black friday? As people would cash out?
Did it dip on black friday 2016?
BTW it's not even half my fortune so i'm investing what I would lose :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:40:27
Wise words ����
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:43:16
I'm worried there's no "incoming dip"
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:18:01
Yea for sure no one know the future, I don't wabt it to rise and miss it, again.
So what're ur thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:23:24
Anyways if I decided to buy it, I have to w8 until morning to deposit the money, hope it doesn't rise 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:42:05
Just seeking advice, it's on me after all, goodluck to u 2!
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:18:39
HODL is hold right?
Sorry I'm a bit new to cryptos ��
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:20:05
So u recommend buying now?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:22:02
Thanka, so u recommend buying now?
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:39:08
I will w8 until tomorrow and decide anyways
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:30:54
I would pay more on fees...
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:28:04
Actually been through this with etherum, it's painful to watch it rise again...
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:45:35
Too many reasons to buy yet to many reasons too wait - Ugh!
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:34:16
Had a bad experience with etherum, bought at 340$ and sold at 290$ and now it's about 333$ I guess, so I won't do the mistake twice, probably do as u said, BUY AND HODL, till after a few months, or years and sell
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:30:23
I'm willing to HODL, but I don't wanna buy and see it lower the next day
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:24:00
That was before like 4 months?
It was the first time to trade, newbie mistakes
