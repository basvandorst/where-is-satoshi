At least they had a safe cold storage it seems.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:11:03
But figuring out the code and opening the safe isn't stealing.  
It might still not be moral (or perhaps legal), but it's not *stealing* to have a look...

Or didn't bother, and just forgot about it and now they are desperately searching through old backups...

True. So it's actually more of a transparent safe so you can see the content (but it's still a lock on it).

Just a canned response that didn't really address your actual question. :/

1 address != 1 person.
@_date: 2014-06-30 07:33:43
I got it too.  
I can add that Hotmail/Live/Outlook luckily sends that e-mail straight to spam. :)

I think he meant operate a typical microwave interface (the type without the plain simple power/time dials).
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:33:28
Divide the two numbers.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:32:47
Then time to start mining? :P
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:46:38
If I give you 1 money and the fee is 0.5 money, then the fee equals 0.5/1 = 0.5 = 50%.
So if we transfer 1 whole BTC from one address to another, and you choose to pay a total fee of e.g. 0.0008 BTC then that equals a fee of 0.0008/1=0.08%

Depends on size of transaction...?
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:15:35
Yeah, there is a record of the transaction itself. But doesn't mean I will get my goods. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:36:47
Thanks. Will try that in the future. 0.00001 took one hour. -.-
6/6 confirmations now. Hopefully they send a confirmation e-mail or something when they recieve the payment.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:44:18
I tried placing an order on that site, but the 15 min invoice timer expired before my payment went through.
I paid using my Bitcoin-Qt wallet.
Is there any way of getting the money back (or the product)?  
This seems like a bad thing when shopping using bitcoins - that you can actually lose all your money because the confirmations are slow?!
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:09:57
Well, I'm up to 1/6 confirmations now. Perhaps they will send me my stuff when it gets 6/6. I hope so.
How much "transaction fee" should I add to my bitcoin transfers if I don't want them to take &gt;30 min?
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:10:27
Thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:30:57
At least you might be able to run Crysis at max settings... :)
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:02:03
Perhaps a noob question, but what is "fiat? I assume you are not talking about cars... :)
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:30:18
Thank you! :)
