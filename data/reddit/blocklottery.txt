Hey guys, just wanted to share the site I just finished developing. Its a lottery game based on found blocks in the bitcoin blockchain. The draw numbers are calculated from the most recent blocks and are completely verifiable. Just wanted to get your opinions on the site and see if you guys would be willing to support the game :)
The site allows you to claim the numbers you want then submit a payment to play the numbers.
You can also simply submit any multiple of 0.005 btc and the site will generate you random numbers
To play multiple times with the same numbers or random numbers simply submit a multiple of the minimum bet:
Random Numbers: 0.0005 * number of plays you want
Custom Numbers: 0.001 * number of plays you want
Comments, questions, and concerns are welcome I will answer all responses.

Good for you! None of what we are doing is illegal as bitcoin is not a fiat currency.

I have lowered prices for tickets since the jackpot is currently small. Prices are now 0.0005 for random tickets and 0.001 for picking your own numbers.

We pay out a larger percentage of the jackpot. Bit millions also charges more to pick your own numbers. Ex. ฿ 0.10338756 will give you 10 plays to 10 33 87 56 we offer the same deal but you can choose to play 10 33 87 56 one time instead of having to pay for 10 rounds. 
We are just trying to get some footing and it takes ticket sales to make the jackpot grow. 
UPDATE: I've also lowered the ticket prices because as you stated the jackpot is low.

If you want proof of legitimacy, first person to buy a ticket gets 0.01 btc sent to their account.

Which is exactly why I'm here. We are trying to get word out about the site. I didnt develop the whole site to run off with your 0.005 btc. 
You have to start somewhere and I chose to start on reddit I'm just here looking for support and like the lottery itself, take a chance.

All payments are automatically paid when you win. Currently a majority of the transactions are myself and friends. you can verify our address on  
As I said I just finished developing it so many of the transactions are tests. but all money is now in the pot to win.
