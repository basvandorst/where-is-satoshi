You are trying to push a narrative that isn't true. The majority of people that support bitcoin support segwit, and LN, and responsible updates to bitcoin core that are peer-reviewed. The only people that disagree are bcash trolls/shills, like you.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:51:08


Correct, this is one of the main differences with bitcoin as opposed to traditional financial transactions. However, the reverse is also true, "Nobody can charge you money or make a payment on your behalf." ~bitcoin.org


Right, because the entire process is transparent to you. That's the goal with lightning network.


You are comparing paypal with bitcoin exchanges, which is not a fair comparison. A fair comparison is comparing paypal with bitcoin wallets, which are secure and cannot be frozen. Have people made fake wallets to attempt to scam people out of cryptocurrencies? Sure. Have people done the same with every other kind of financial bank/site/app, including paypal? [Absolutely.](


Right, because your money isn't leaving their ecosystem. All they have to do is update their internal spreadsheet. Which, again, is not a fair comparison to traditional bitcoin transactions.


With bitcoin, your payments are protected by a 17 exahash/s network. Seems protected to me. ;) To address your actual point that your payments are "protected" in the fact that you can dispute them, you are correct. There is no way to do that with bitcoin. This is one of the trade-offs for having a global, peer to peer, decentralized payment system.


My point wasn't how many tx/s are happening, my point is that bitcoin is growing and people are using it. You ignored that point. To counter your point, you forget that bitcoin has only been around for 9 years. Credit cards have been around for [decades.]( Additionally, bitcoin is just the first layer in a financial transaction medium protocol stack, which lightning network builds on and fixes any tx/s limits there are currently. One of the cool things about bitcoin is that it's being constantly developed and improved, and it can adapt to any challenges it might face in the future.


Again, my previous point was to show that bitcoin *is* being used. As another metric, coinbase alone has [more than doubled its number of users this year.](

[No,]( they [didn't.](


Not yet.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:57:49


Those aren't chargeback times, those are settlement times. Educate yourself before you make arguments, please.


The end goal isn't for users to type in "0.0003029 btc to starbucks" in their mobile wallet to send a bitcoin tx, it's to be completely transparent to users. In order to accommodate things like that, we need lightning network.


You *have* read about the [ad hominem fallacy]( haven't you? You're only hurting your own arguments.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:35:41
Because the companies behind the initial bcash fork were the same companies benefiting from ASICBoost. Additionally, bcash **does not** have a fix for ASICBoost.

Google "ASICBoost". Bcash was a fork off of Bitcoin because miners were unhappy that segwit patched ASICBoost. Now, Roger Ver and his goons are trying to confused people into thinking bcash is Bitcoin.
This is not a conspiracy, [this is a fact.](
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:55:10
Personally, I believe noobs see bitcoin cash as a "cheaper bitcoin", since they don't understand the technological difference between the two, which is why the price hasn't crashed extremely low. Noobs want to invest in "the next bitcoin" but don't want to do research. Also, the price is probably market manipulated to ensure it doesn't crash extremely low.
Additionally, who do you think has more investment capital? Users, or companies?
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:00:09


You're making arguments which aren't true. Today, you could send a bitcoin payment from yourself to any one else in the bitcoin ecosystem, anywhere in the world, in under an hour. This is something you simply cannot do with the traditional banking system.


Actually, there are many cryptcurrencies which all have their own unique use case. Although at this point bitcoin is not unique in its protocol or transactions, it is unique in the fact that it was the first and has the largest, non-corporate dev team.
A couple examples of unique crypto use cases:
ETH: Decentralized computer
ZEC: Completely anonymous transactions
Again, cryptocurrency is a very new idea and I am excited to see where it goes in the coming decades. Also, if you don't like bitcoin and think it's price is unfounded or is going to go down, feel free to short it on any of the major regulated exchanges which offer that, including CME and CBOE.

Additionally, bitcoin lightning tx's do confirm in seconds.

Edit: also, you've only been around since 2016.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:17:06


Incorrect. Although Visa/credit card payments seem instant, they actually take [24 hrs to 3 days to settle]( - slower than bitcoin settlements, and other cryptocurrencies are even faster.


Oh, you mean a centralized authority which has a [history of freezing accounts]( No thanks.


I'm assuming you mean ACH, not wire transfer. For ACH, settlement also takes [several **business** days]( - also slower than bitcoin!


If nobody uses it, [why has the number of transactions doubled over the past 2 years?](
Of course, all of this is ignoring the fact that lightning bitcoin transactions happen within seconds, which blow away all of your arguments as well. :)

@_date: 2018-01-07 00:22:02


Right, because the companies produce products and have value. Cryptocurrencies have value because of their unique use cases, such as the ability to directly transfer monetary value from one person to another on the opposite side of the globe, in less than a minute.


Please, keep making points. I need to keep my debate skills sharp.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:33:47
There's two bitcoin networks - testnet and mainnet. Mainnet is where the actual bitcoin transactions occur, etc. Testnet is where developers can test out new features or things like LN without any financial risk (basically, testnet is the pre-prod environment).
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:02:26

@_date: 2018-01-09 03:53:51
Then you clearly don't understand what ASICboost was. It was a **flaw** in the bitcoin protocol, which has since been patched.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:02:37
I sincerely doubt there are many users that actually believe that. Satoshi and his whitepaper aren't Jesus and the bible, they're guidelines. The cool thing about cryptocurrency is that it can and should adapt and improve. All it takes is a little bit of research to realize that bcash propaganda is exactly that - just propaganda. Noobs don't always do research though.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:03:59


I would argue that you are blinded by your disdain for bitcoin which stops you from viewing it objectively.
Alternatively, you're just a paid shill. Either way, you should take some tips from who was a much better debater than you.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:05:20


You mean when companies go bankrupt and their share prices plummet to $0? I sure want stocks then!


Again, like I said earlier, the value isn't backed by anything because it is intrinsic. It has a unique use case as opposed to any traditional financial transaction medium. Is this worth $16k a bitcoin? I don't know, but I do know that it's worth *something*.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:17:47


No, it's not.
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:41:37


Except even Bitcoin is much faster than a wire transfer.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:44:08


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that segwit was a requirement for LN? In which case, bcash wouldn't be able to implement LN.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:58:10
Most likely because they believed the propaganda that bitcoin "is failing", etc.

It's very kind of you to propose this. In fact, I've been upgrading my audio equipment over the past year.
However the main problem is my lifestyle, not the equipment. I travel continuously (have been for 4 years). The videos that are not on stage are made in whichever Airbnb or hotel I'm staying at each 2-4 week period. I often have very little space to work in and the acoustics are terrible.
Furthermore, I can only carry very lightweight equipment. Half my luggage allowance is A/V gear almost. I can't fit a nice big Sennheiser studio mic for example. I use lavalier microphones (Rode, Sennheiser) but they're omnidirectional and pick up the reverb from the hard surfaces in the room.
Anyhow, thanks for the support. Doing my best to improve production quality!

The easiest way is to just rent a server/vps and set it up remotely. Setting up a physical node takes much more time/effort. However, if you want to make one as a personal project, more power to you.

By all means, feel free to make your own.


You should read the article before you make an uneducated opinion. Open and close is for the timeframe you use, not an opening and closing price like the stock market.


You can easily do that by [charting an MA]( for bitcoin.

It gives resolution to the price movement. A 1h candle is comprised of 60 1m candles. When you zoom in from 1h to 1m, you can more accurately see how the price moved.
Go to tradingview and watch a 1m candlestick chart vs a 1m line chart. The end of the line moves all over the place, because the price fluctuates in that 1m. The candle graphs the entirety of the price movement from the beginning of the minute (open), to the lowest price during that minute (low), to the highest price during that minute (high), to finally the price when that minute ends (close). With a line chart, you have no idea what the high or low were during that minute (apart from hovering over with your mouse and reading the prices).

Prior to Segwit, there was a flaw in the bitcoin protocol which allowed miners to mine easier/faster than expected, called AsicBoost. Bitmain (a mining company) patented AsicBoost, and shipped it with their miners. In addition to allowing easier mining, AsicBoost encouraged mining low transaction/no transaction blocks, which obviously goes against what bitcoin is designed for. The Segwit update, among other additions, patched this flaw in the bitcoin protocol, and made Bitmain mine at the same difficulty as everybody else ("play fair").

How many people do you think actually understood the intricacies of UASF? Yet it's not hard to understand that it forced a miner to play fair. Just because people don't understand the technical aspects of something doesn't mean they can't understand the overview.

It's not that it matters any more than any other price during that minute, it's just what you use to chart the candle. If you didn't have open and close (or high/low) you wouldn't have wicks. Again, I encourage you to go watch a 1m candlestick chart so you can see how wicks are made, etc.
