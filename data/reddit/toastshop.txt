Were educated people more or less likely to vote Trump? Who are the idiots again?

But one is for unnecessary sport, and the other one is for unnecessary food while simultaneously destroying the planet we need to live on. Not a fair comparison!

There are other online payment providers than PayPal. PayPal shouldn't be forced to work with people it doesn't want to work with.

It's not a new thing is it, like I told you I understand the graph 
Tell me how the title of this post relates to the graph, which is notable cos it's using a different scale to every other bitcoin graph regularly seen and not cos it's zoomed out

that axis is pretty misleading

I don't know why this is disputed

Well yeah but 'a fraction' in this context means 'a small amount'. Like less than 25% down.
