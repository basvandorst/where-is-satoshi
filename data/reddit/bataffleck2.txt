i don't want more btc or bch or b2x. I want more value (as in value in USD$)
if btc (and b2x) messed up so much that they both dropped to 500, while bch has miner support and goes up to 4000, why bother?

the longest chain will live. the other will die out.
currently both BTC and BCH are competing. the one backed by the most mining hash/nodes will continue, the other will die out.

he said, "im gonna wait till BCH is higher than Bitcoin.. I assume it gonna be a close fight and the price will met at $2500 in coming weeks.. if it happens, i will convert my BCH to bitcoin, hence double my bitcoin"

well not yet. but we have hundreds ICO this year alone, mostly using ethereum erc20 token, on ethereum blockchain.  among these many ICO, 90% Are either scam or failed to deliver.. 
but the 10% will have real world use. 2% - 5% will be big (no source.. just gut feeling, based on 90s dotcom bubble experience)
and ethereum is the backbone of those successful erc20s. they will make ethereum ecosystem more solid as well.
if you say, well no dapps yet. well yeah, but lots of companies already putting their stake here. so im optimistic it gonna happen. 
that's from ecosystem &amp; future potential
from mining vs developers: too much drama in bitcoin. nothing special on ethereum side, but bitcoin has too many drama. 
 just for scalability issue, we have so many drama since 2014 while ethereum has clear plan on metropolis fork, Byzantium &amp; konstantinopel &amp; raiden 
but tbh,  this doesn't give much score to eth imho..  just.. I dont like drama lol. but I do understand sometimes it just unavoidable.
well in the end, it is the potential of smart contract in general. the magnitude of usage of it: notary, banking, gaming, logistic, copyright, cloud computing, exchange, property... every single sector will be distrubted by newcomers with smart contract ... and those new comers will likely to use ethereum erc20 (as we have already seen in icos)
so, as I said. a better (smarter) bitcoin. but hey, I could be wrong
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:11:04
people here are mostly pure holders. 
average joe that refuse to learn just wont gonna buy&amp; hold bitcoin. even with coinbase.
so if they buy ETF instead, and spike up the price.. I don't mind 
just make sure to spread your profit to ethereum, gold, property, cash... before the dump  
but meanwhile bitcoin will prevail. this ETF cant kill bitcoin. the only thing that can kill bitcoin is better bitcoin (ie. ethereum)
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:55:20
from what we see on gold ETF, silver ETF, people use em mostly for trading. holders will keep the physical or at least the 100%-backed gold account.

just so you know... If you hold.. we will go to 3000, 4000, 10.000
but like.. in 5-10 yrs time.
and there will be big fall in price in between. dont let it get you down. (hint: buy during that time)
like now, we are having a big jump in price... but this massive jump will eventually become too unsustainable...  we will go down. and fast. maybe to 1500.. or even 1200.. before the price get stable in.. lets say 1800 ish
the stabilization process will take very long. like a year or more... during that time, it's as if nothing interesting happens. just goes up slowly.
and then suddenly another jump in price...
and so on..
but if you want to be here for a long game, you will learn to ignore the big jumps and the big falls, and watch the stable periods. and that stable periods has been rising constantly since 2009

@_date: 2017-05-30 10:16:57
i disagree. you should be able to deal with everyone, anywhere, public or private. 
any miners should be able to run any software they want.
economy incentives is the main key. economy incentives and decentralization is the spirit of bitcoin. not openness, not trust, not honesty.
(which is why it confuse me. eric L said he wont tell miners what to do.. so why complain wih jihan doing what he did? and.. he has zero trust on jihan? great. this is bitcoin. you don't need to trust anyone)
decentralized mean shit if we get to say what jihan has to do. yes he has patents etc. but economy incentives is the main key.
and if.. IF... jihan main goal is to destroy Bitcoin.. (he is like The Joker or something) 51% attack etc and make the value drops... well, then bitcoin deserves​ to fail and we can put it under "failed experiment."
there's always people like Jihan, and if we rally stuff like BIP148s everytime a kid like jihan shows up. then bitcoin sucks. 
but I believe it's not.

who's we?
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:11:57
when everyone is so super optimistic with the price.... be cautious.
we are probably at denial/ bull trap right now.
when suddenly lots of newcomers come (like you maybe), we are at "public" phase.. whenever the "public" phase starts, it's already a bubble. 
it's ok though. the cycle repeats. you may be part if public now, but you are part of smart money later... heck, you actually are now, compared to those who haven't even heard of btc. and that's a lot
   
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:23:57
lol, if I may suggest, learn from past "bubble &amp; burst."
there was a time when bitcoin goes up to $39, and then fall back to $2.. TWO DOLLARS
And a more recent bubble (2013), the price goes up to 1200, and down to 400-600.
what's​ important for me though:
- price before the jump.
- price after the fall.
 
again, google the historical price chart, and learn from it.

@_date: 2017-05-30 16:01:57


it's not a crime. it's like protesting milos or.. breitbart. they got freedom of speech. 


never did. but apparently his support is due to his personal Feeling towards jihan then? just "in spite of"...  not due the virtue/tech benefit of the BIP itself. lol


for... inflation? make supply higher​ than demand? so the value drop? (that's what happened when gov. print money... anyway I lost you here.. im slow)
so.. what, they dont have insentive to push 21M? do you have? I don't... why maximize the supply when the demand is still so small. (small demand: no public adoption. I still can't use btc at my local 7/11 --- that's my benchmark)


if they can't get enough money... I dunno.. stop mining? 
this is back to my point of public adoption. miners, coinbase, developers, everyone surely agree on pushing on public adoption. increase the demand tenfold.. increase number of transactions (and the fee) exponentially.
right now the only party focusing public adoption is... coinbase (and kinda bad at that lately, usually they are great). 




aww cmon, BU is not thaaat bad... well... but anyway,  I compared him to joker earlier. I throw it out earlier. When I say "sane miners", I wasn't referring him.




seems to reckless. forced. not a solution for decentralized currency. But I maybe wrong. my problem is that most people who support it were just in it in spite of Jihan. it worries me. 




 at least we agree he did not say: 'NEVER EVER lift the limit'
 &gt; but he never says what is the criteria and not to mention he doesn't have the knowledge that we have now.
and what is it that we know now? that lifting the limit will doom bitcoin? no we don't know that.
 that segwit is way better solution? in what way? (other than no hardfork, which is not necessarily better) I'm not
convinced. who controlled segwit? will it be decentralized too?

@_date: 2017-05-30 13:28:10


I say it wrongly. what I mean is. closed door meetings are expected and can not be avoided. so why bother protesting like eric here? 
any proposals should have very heavy scrutity. regardless how it made.
censoring will not go unnoticed. and will make people chose other method. btc is not the only big player in the field anymore. people going out = price drop. as usual, economy incentives is the protector here.


that was... very gullible of him. of course they are not. we are not. no one is. each person is for his/her personal gain. hence the trustless concept.
his mistake is stated in the beginning: he see this as cool tech and not as money. 


err.. no. both you &amp; any sane miner want price to be maximized &amp; public to adopt BTC.. 
yes miners want the fees as high as possible, but it can only as high as the market (you) can accept it. else they move on to the next big crypto currency. and public adoption is a no go.
yes.. there's a need to balance the fees vs number of transaction. ( low fee - high transaction vs hi fee low transaction.),
but until public adopts btc, we are still in miniscule number of transactions. the focus (both sane miners &amp; everyone else) is public adoption.


seeking control means btc drops and his investment &amp; patents gone. right?
well... lets see? again, if btc as a system cannot manouver facing guys like this. it's a failed experiment. but I believe it can.
i just think delays, blockstream, segwit.. are not the solution. just lift the 2mb limit. it was intended as a temporary limit anyway. 
if it's gonna hardfork so be it. BIP148 also gonna split the chain too. might as well do the cleaner split.

this is my problem with current PIB148:
-  no one talks about the advantage from tech /economy point of view (well except luke's medium.. but not enough.. mostly it talks only the disadvantage if not running one)
- everyone seems support it just in spite of jihan in particular. 
- and ad hominem stuff: oh you are those guys! oh you are chinese miners! oh troll!
dammit man, if im troll, Im the one who do ad hominem crap.
kids like jihan will shows up every year! yes he got patent n shit, but that doesn't matter. bitcoin principles will make sure he wont be able to control it. and BIP148 seems rushed and reckless. and enforcing the will of minority (hence the question: who's "we"?) to the market. this worries me

what do you mean? there are already several implementation. maybe not worldwide, but moving there steadily.
the latest one is humaniq, which managed to get 4500 btc invested. or 5million USD at that time. 
also it (ethereum I mean) has good numbers of people&amp; companies doing stuff in development.
you think root gonna suddenly accelerate in front of eth?
heck, there's even BOScoin (blockchain OS coin). I don't know much about this, still lesrning, but slightly different​ implementation of smart contract. but managed to get 6900 BTC raised just in (less than) a day.
the field is not empty. lots of experienced players with LOTS of money. lots of scammers too. which no doubt will targeting root as well
you think theDAO was bad for eth? (well yes..) but whatever that didn't kill eth, will make it stronger.. there's benefit even from bad experience.   
but I do rooting for root as well (heh!)

mean line is can be steady OR exponential (btc mean line if you see it from the beginning till today is exponential), 
but it can also goes up &amp; down determined by  the fundamentals/property of bitcoin. it's alive.. lol
let me copy paste my comments to other dude.. wait.. 
ok, here it is:
basically, short terms (this diagram) are affected by human emotions (fear, greed, etc)
while long term (shown as mean line , dashed grey) affected by the fundamentals /performance of the commodity itself. it can be steady, it can be moving up exponentially, up &amp; down... sideways... etc.
what I mean is, 
short term:
say, apple stock, went up during iphone release then drop again.. cos people rush to buy the stock then sell.. greed/fear. this is what happen to Bitcoin during last few days (imho)
long term:
but for apple stock, the mean line steadily &amp; exponentially rise up.. thats because the performance of apple as a company (yearly profit, employee satisfaction, costumer service score, independent reviews of their products etc) is bloody good.
it can also (steadily or suddenly) drop because the management sucks and made crucial mistakes... or the product is no longer the best not because of their fault, but because samsung is just better (just a sample)
bitcoin? what are the fundamentals? widely accepted (for a crypto)? yes.
great developer team? mm... too many fighting &amp; censorship,no?
solid algorithm? sure. but now we are making a second layer that might not be as solid. i dunno.
low transaction fee? hmmm... still low.. not as low as it was..
short confirmation time? not anymore. it can be for days.. or even cancelled (if you use coinbase)
and how about other crypro coins? are  the other competition with better fundamentals?
are there "samsung" here?

dont do anything with those coins until the dust is settled. HODL

there can be multiple peaks/bulltraps.  
remember catipulation usually follows by despair, despair is near or even below mean price. which is the price before the jump happened (1300)
as long as we are above 1700, there's no fear. its still way higher than the price 4 weeks ago. what's to fear?
fear is below 1700.

we are in a bloody big bubble that will fall sharp in matter of weeks (being optimistic),  we have super long transaction delays and still havent figure out how to increase a block in a proper way. it's been 3 years. and the only solution is somehow to have minority taking decision for majority.

you got mixed up between Bitcoin being decentralized and a fork of bitcoin software maintenance being centralized.
what's the difference between bitcoin core centralized team and BU centralized team? ot any other teams.
the fact that any miner CAN Run (without coersion) any software they want.. is decentralization.
 jihan free to do whatever shit he does... major players can have any bloody hidden meeting they want.. everyone can run whatever variant of btc software and download/running  the blockchain
... those are consequences of decentralization 
btc is decentralized.. hence trustless. so why eric complains that he do not trust jihan? it's good. don't trust anyone.

i think we have passed that.. maybe the first bull trap. do note, even though it is not indicated in the chart, there can be several "bull traps" and several "new paradigms" before the massive dip.
after going thru these kind of situations several times (in btc &amp; precious metals), I learn to focus on the big picture instead: the mean (here represented with gray dashed line)
if I play short term I usually sell a bit when everyone is buying (clue: when major news site start repoting btc price... prepare you exit, the "public/mania" phase is about to start)
but not now, im holding for a long run now. super long run. but I do spread to other coins &amp; ICOs just for fun.
and I wait for the massive dip. i predict it will fall all the way below mean line.. (despair, it's not always fall below mean line though)
if you look into all time btc price chart (vs USD), you can assume the mean line is  around... around 1000-1200ish? yeah.
ill start buying again once btc fall to 1300-1400ish, bit by bit.

chill dude.. even Microsoft had their bad underperforming days..  
imagine coinbase is your local bank which only have 5 counters... what happened now is like thousands of people rushing to cash their check/open account/ buy stuff &amp; sell stuff in that bank. and people just keep coming....
and this is after 3 whole years of very slow yet steady business.
the bank is understaff, unequipped for that volume, and very unprepared with the amount of work need to be done.
people say the bank need to hire more staff, need bigger vault, more this, extra that.. to accommodate the thousands of new costumers.
lets say  the bank did just that: spend its money/resources to accommodate current (Very High) number of transactions.. 
borrow some money, rent bigger building, more staff, more computers, borrow even more....
then bang! the bubble burst! no more transactions! what will happen if tomorrow/next week everything goes back to normal? or even a massive drop like 2013?  the bank will go bankrupt no? or at least a financial problem
now we don't want coinbase to have that problem don't we?

this reminds me of michiko kaku's video on levels of civilization.
- level 1: planetary (as in having moonbase &amp; going to mars etc.)
- level 2: between solar systems
- level 3: inter-galactic
we are at the end of level 0, trying to reach level 1..  if we as human can just focus our effort instead of fighting among ourselves.
we are in the single very crucial phase:
- either we make it and move forward to level 1 (and maybe stay at level 1.. or move up).... or,
- we failed. and crashed hard. dooming ourselves. since there is no option of staying in level 0. not when we use the earth resources as we do now. either go up to level 1 or... well...  we went mad max.
what currently happen in bitcoin is same as that. we are at level 0. reaching level 1: our moonbase, our Mars colony. amazon level of transaction.
level 2 is conquering solar systems. nation wide. (lets say US)
level 3 is, well.. everyone else.
once we reached level 1, level 2&amp;3 are just matter of time.
but we are at the end of level 0, fighting among ourselves: censoring opposing ideas, ridiculling different opinions. each group in their own echo Chambers.
if we can get thru this, we will go to the moon and beyond. or, just like any other investment.. once people no longer desire it....it can go worthless. a failed experiment.
just because we are at 2000, doesn't mean we can't go zero next year. what we  do now will determine our future
we are in the most crucial intersection. what a fun time.

dude, I bought Bitcoin when it was $60. 
from zhou tong. that scammer (im one of the lucky few not getting scam)
i also spread my investment on other crypto currency: like litecoin, peercoin, ethereum, and just now: Boscoin. some I cash it and buy silver &amp; gold and other portfolios
some sucks to oblivion, some gain even more profit than btc, like ethereum. heck I even double my bitcoin by playing around with lite&amp;peercoin in 2013 bubble
this is not childplay where "oh you are not from bitcoin! you are from ethereum"
we grownups treat Bitcoin (and other  investment) as.. well.. investment.
investment means I believe in it. and when I lost confidence, I move out. right now, I see how USAF implemented by minority as a bad move. right now I have more convident in ethereum 
I used not to mind the "echo chamber-ish" environment in this sub, since I (and every other grownups) can read opposing ideas in other subs. but forcing ideals believed by minority to the majority? i disagree. 
I will leave some of my btc around, but as any other investors will suggest you: dont put all your eggs in one basket 
especially in one basket you know have a lot of problems to agree on how to increase the bloody block (for.. 2? 3 years? man..) and currently has hours of transaction delays... when other basket can add a frickin contracts into their blocks
oh, and I lost my access to my 1st account "u/bat-affleck" , cos I keep changing my android apps and reddit forced me to change password etc. I didnt connect my account with any email, so I cant use it now. lurking for a year or so, and now im back commenting

people will use the one with the best features. 
right now some of the obvious ones are number of mercharts and transaction time.
bitcoin is king for the first one. litecoin is great on the latter. ethereum is runner up on both categories.. 
never ever think just because it was the first, it will be the default choice. remember kodak, nokia, Ericsson, MS windows mobile, friendster. we are far from public adoption.

lol, nice! 
you reminded me, i just realized I still have 250 doge too.. yep 250.. lol.. like 0.00001 usd or something.
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:22:01


yup, but it will take hours for confirmation if you want to spend that one cent
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:34:46
hmmm... ehtereum? no? yeah i think btc is king in that sector too
@_date: 2017-06-28 09:33:32
yea, that's true
@_date: 2017-06-26 06:25:16
and the name. the name super sucks lol

is it possible to have this included in khan academy? for wider audience. i dunno, just curious.
@_date: 2017-06-13 04:43:28
for all we know, jihan might already own gazillion eth. therefore both might be win-win instead of lose-lose.
dude is greedy. but he is also smart. im sure he got exit strategy. scary
@_date: 2017-06-26 09:36:55
yep confirmation. thanks for the correction.
I think we should not compare with visa/Master card. maybe with mmm..western union?
no, should compare it with bank transfer... or..ideally.. cash.
cos visa is a 3rd party that gives guarantee/costumer protection.. you don't wait for 180 days after making 10K usd payments using visa. 
with bitcoin, a 10K usd transaction without confirmation for 2 hours (it happens) will make you nuts.. a bit apple vs orange i think.
