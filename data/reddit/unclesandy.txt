Kind of a dumb statistic. We can make the statement too that the US dollar has crashed against any appreciating asset. Does this mean apple stock is as good of a store of value as Bitcoin? Not to spark an argument of what assets truly have value, but this is irrelevant data. The irony is at the end of the day, our bench mark for "value" of BTC is the USD anyway. Yet we all bash the US dollar, and we all buy and sell cryptocurrency to accumulate more US dollars in the end.
If we all hate and bash on USD so much, why are we all so thrilled when Bitcoin is worth more of it? 
Note: I have been buying and selling crypto for years now, and do support the technology entirely.

Wether or not it's possible to say this stat is true, it's useless anyway. Look at the market cap of Bitcoin vs. any traditional market, and the life time of the markets. You can't even compare the two. Because that is exactly where this statistic is headed....

The fees are so minuscule I don't understand the shock and awe?? Taker on cb pro is 0.3% taker, up to $10m.  Fees should be a well established part of your strategy, they are something you must work around.

It is legitimate.

Completely irrelevant information.

Robinhood also has a tremendous lag time behind current prices. I highly doubt they aren't scalping in between.

So we bash the value of the USD in one post, yet here we praise profiting in USD?
