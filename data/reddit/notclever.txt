Speculation markets have existed a lot longer than Warren Buffett, I'm pretty sure.

Yeah, BTC is like... the antithesis of what Buffett is about.

OTOH, nobody knew that BTC wasn't going to crash a year ago, and there are no underlying fundamentals to indicate to anyone one way or the other, so this is a hindsight problem.

This is a big part of what people don't think about, I think. These modern behemoth companies weren't really showing indicators of becoming behemoths when they went public. Apple, Netflix, Google, Amazon, all of them started in a specific niche and then made a shitload of money by expanding in a relatively unexpected way.

If that's the story I'm thinking of, didn't he commit suicide because he had millions in bitcoin in a wallet on a hard drive that he threw out or erased or something?

The law, ultimately. I.e., if you have your credit card stolen, with various caveats, you have no liability for purchases made on your stolen card. Someone definitely eats that loss, but it's not you.

Different protections for each payment type.
Basically, when credit cards were created, the fraud protection laws were made very consumer friendly when choosing where the burden was allocated. Banks didn't really know what they were getting into.
Ever since then, every time a new payment method is created, the banks have lobbied for more of the burden to be placed on the consumer (things like requiring the consumer to notify the bank of a fraudulent charge within a shorter window, etc.) or the merchant.

Because we don't live in a totalitarian state where you get arrested and put through a kangaroo court.

That's not true, though. You're only at risk of dying if you are doing something violent that is threatening lives of others. Cops are never enforcing traffic tickets with the threat of death.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:38:10


You said it was enforced with the threat of death. Threat of force is not threat of death.


Well yeah, if you decide you need to pull a gun on a cop to "defend yourself" that's going to happen. The entire point of cops is that as a society we've chosen to allow them to use force to maintain order with the general understanding that the justice system allows you to non-violently dispute any charges made against you.

Because, as I mentioned before, we live in a society where the law is constructed to authorize the police to use force to arrest you, and to allow you to pursue release through the courts. The law is also constructed so that resisting arrest by force is in itself a violation of the law, and police are authorized to escalate the force used to arrest you based on your resistance.
In other words, (1) you don't *need* to defend yourself physically from being arrested because if you haven't violated the law then you can secure release through the justice system and (2) you know that the police are legally authorized to use force against you and that resisting them forcefully is a very bad idea for you.


This is a totally different scenario then the one we are dealing with in this thread, and it's pretty irrelevant to the discussion.

Wasn't your entire point that it was basically justified self defense to hire an assassin to kill someone that might turn you in to police for breaking the law? 
From a moral standpoint, it's pretty important to distinguish between a scenario where you are defending yourself from a private actor that is trying to kidnap you, and a scenario where you are defending yourself from being arrested by the police for violating American law (especially if you're a white dude).
