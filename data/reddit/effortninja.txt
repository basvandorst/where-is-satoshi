they have their own trading algorithm so I expect their prices to reflect a ton of variables, including availability of coins and market rate at other exchanges, as well as demand from CBs own buyers.  They don't publish volume so I'm guessing it could be a combination of difficulty sourcing coins and higher buying pressure on CB itself. 
TLDR they wanna make money

Real wall st money is waiting for clear regulatory guidance and wall st-level exchange infrastructure.  
Individual investors who also might be pro wall st traders don't pay 'retail' price.  They are buying from large holders off-exchange to avoid massive slippage, and also BTC exchanges are rightfully seen as shady since the GOXXing.

Liquidity - by definition it's hard to spend coins which are properly secured on your own machines or paper wallets.  Leaving coins at a 3rd party assures they are able to be moved easily.  In this case, traders need to quickly buy and sell coins so they leave them on exchanges.
Some people think 3rd parties provide more secure storage but I think that's a myth, especially when someone can securely store coins with just a little research.
I suggest a hotwallet for a small amount of coins you want to move quickly, for purchases or tips, and a secure cold storage system for your long term holdings.

Off the top of my head I suggest downloading the electrum client over the QT client, since you won't have to download ~10 gb of blockchain.  
Practice safe computing habits, try to stay away from shady sites that could steal your coins.  Coinbase and blockchain.info have been reputable so far if you want to go with a hosted wallet, but trusting any third party introduces risk that they could fold like GOX.  
I personally have a tiny bit of coins in a less secure "hot" wallet, and savings in a locked down "cold" wallet.  Also have wallet apps on my phone to transfer in person between friends and for businesses that accept BTC in person.
As far as aquiring BTC, it depends on where you are.  Again coinbase is good but only if you are in the US.  Be careful of in-person trades.

You don't have to assume any exchange/delay risk at all, you can price in dollars and receive dollars from either of those two companies.  I believe you get a direct deposit daily but my information is likely outdated.
I've made multiple purchases using both intermediaries exceeding 1K USD and no problems at all.  Tigerdirect, overstock, and amagimetals combined must exceed 1M/month in BTC sales so I'd say coinbase/bitpay are trustworthy and large enough.

25k to them sounds like an insignificant amount.  I'd tell them to use coinbase's vault for the majority of it, and maybe a little bit in a coinbase hot wallet for messing around.  Set them up with 2FA and make sure the extra withdrawal protection from the coinbase vault is active.
If they want to get more technical then a trezor would do, but if your  concern is simplicity at a reasonable level of security then CB will do.

We are in an inflationary period in the history of BTC.  The course is pre-determined by algorithm and will be approximately on track even if there was only 1 miner left.

AFAIK there is no way to choose which address to spend from in the QT wallet.  If you make a payment large enough, coins from multiple addresses in your wallet could be combined, linking them all together.  The blockchain.info app on my phone lets me choose which address to spend from.

I think in the infamous yoga ball video, they pinky swear that they cant trade in their own exchange, because it would be illegal.  we see in the leaked documents that they were in the stages of doing just that, arbitraging their own exchange to fleece their customers and get out of the hole they dug for themselves.

The ~12% drop since you bought isn't out of the ordinary.  Check the historical price charts here: 
If you are losing sleep over the drop, you've over-spent and should sell until you have enough money in BTC to not care if it goes to 0.  High risk high reward.

saying there is "nothing to stop the mass issuance" is incorrect.  And many people have changed the variables of BTC, they're all the altcoins. 
I'm sure that a fork of the existing BTC network enacting a mass issuance will have detractors, and the resulting fork won't be called bitcoin.

1.0  No reason unless BTC provides added value compared to the legacy system.
2.0  Value is subjective and bitcoin users and their spending habits are still easily tracked by both financial and government institutions.  If you dont care about pseudonymity, then I suggest reading  to see if you agree with what value it can provide.
3.1  cash back - not a part of the bitcoin protocol.  Bitcoin users can choose merchants like gyft who offer cash back on all btc purchases (cash, btc back?).  BTC remains analogous to cash not a credit card, and third parties can fill the roles which credit cards provide with cash.
3.2  fraud protection - not a part of the bitcoin protocol.  users don't have to give this up if they go through a 3rd party just like they would with cash.  The choice is still there.  Also see 
3.3 price matching - again bitcoin merchants offer this and there is no possible way to include this in the protocol.

Unfortunately I don't think a reddit reply can effectively convey all that you need to learn.  I suggest reading everything on the sidebar, and probably avoiding the wikipedia (but the BTC wiki is ok) and most news articles.

Here's what you should do:
Sketch up a few endgame scenarios for btc (BTC Singularity, BTC limited use, BTC Shadow Economy Only, BTC Dead).
And assign a percent probability and best guess at price for each scenario.  
Calculated a weighted average price based on your guesses.
Check if your calculated price is lower or higher than what you can get BTC for.
Buy or Short BTC based on above.
Update your original guesses based on an ever changing BTC ecosystem.

@_date: 2014-05-20 14:29:15
Do you have something to sell, or skills you could put to use for BTC?  Any friends you know have BTC?  
If you have linked your bank info at coinbase, the easiest way to get BTC would be to buy it there, but don't put in more than you're willing to lose.
Maybe play around with a small amount on a client directly on your computer, until you feel safe enough to properly secure your wallet.
The wiki is also a good place to start
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:09:44

MTGOX hasn't been the highest volume exchange for a long time.  It was a shell of it's former self.
There is a chance that existing exchanges will do the same thing.  This is why the first legit exchange in the US operating under oversight of the law will make a killing.  The NY bitlicense and 2ndmarkets NY exchange are trying to do just this.
Faith in BTC hasn't been shattered.  Can't blame a protocol for weakness in 3rd party services.

newegg had them in stock in 1 hour increments at least twice last week.  AFAIK they are still being manufactured so you should have luck just checking religiously.  The 5770 is also pretty power efficient and you will be able to run a few of them from a low cost power supply.

Gox running on fractional reserve, suddenly the withdrawal delays are making sense. 
Conspiracy theory: Gox is the whale, pushing up prices with fake dollars.  Panic buyers fleeing gox get less coins than they would have in a real market, since the 'price' is so high.  Bonus - Gox gets their cash.  Gox is out of cash but still has considerable BTC reserves, so a high price is only beneficial to them.

+1 for coinbase, at least if you are in the US.  Your coins will only be in their hotwallet until you transfer them out after you buy them.  Beware of change transactions when using paper wallets, but otherwise you seem to be taking the right steps and asking the right questions.

I think of transaction fees and miners/blocksize limits as a secondary market that will need to find balance within bitcoin.  As we approach the blocklsize limit, miners have an incentive to include transactions with fees, and users have the incentive to include fees for high priority transactions.  However as Davos has said, transaction fees are voluntary and only enforced via client and not the bitcoin algorithm.

"Currency Equivalents" to me would mean something like seashells or another random item whose only function would be to exchange for real currency.  So if I sold BTC for seashells and then immediately exchanged them for dollars in a tongue in cheek exchange, I would be a money exchanger.  Money equivalent could even be a house if I turned around and sold it right away.  Maybe they mean something like a prepaid visa or moneypak.  The end result would be exchanging BTC for USD.

There is always a chance that value could drop by a huge amount.  For instance, if governments of the world declared it illegal, or blocked funding portals like exchanges from the legacy banking system (like they did with poker).  You can wait for a crash, but there is really no predicting what will happen.
If you have friends that have BTC, buy them lunch or something in exchange for a few bucks worth?  If nobody you know has any, sell some of your stuff or your labor at I'd bet that a lot of the faucet and free BTC sites have some kind of malware that targets your BTC wallet so it is probably safer to store any that you have at coinbase or even the blockchained wallet.  Do that until you are absolutely confident in your PC security.

AFAIK the upgraded jalapenos are pre-overclocked from BFL, but also use binned chips which naturally have more overclock potential.  I think 9 is possible but you should be careful and upgrade cooling.  This guy got 9+ by tweaking the firmware to a more aggressive level:
In these low difficulty times it's worth it to make hay while the sun is shining and reduce the life and power efficiency of your jalapenos and then throttle down in the future when they are hashing right at the edge of efficient returns.

Use mined coins for goods and services, and fincen guidelines do not apply.  So actually use bitcoin as a currency instead of a speculative investment.  If you must exchange for dollars, stay under the fincen threshold of 1k per day and you are OK.  Don't forget to report your cap gains and pay taxes.

Over there you can check exactly how much slippage you'd incur for any given USD buy or sell.  The bottom graph is the orderbook which I'm guessing you can figure out how to read.
Also, stay away from Gox, it's a black hole.  You won't be able to buy 50btc from coinbase within a month.  Might have more luck at bitstamp or find someone to give a duffel bag of money to at localbitcoins.

Getting something of value (BTC) from free sites is shady at best.  Mining difficulty has made it a specialized profession.  The question comes down to how does one make money.  Provide value to someone and get paid for it.  Maybe or would be a good place to start.  Or just accept the friction of buying BTC with your local currency.  Imagine if you had started when you first tried to get into it a few years ago.

1. Stability and liquidity.
2. Evidence from bitcoinstore.com shows exchange rate increases actually boost sales.  If BTC rises in value, people are more willing to spend because its money thats burning a hole in their pocket.  Everyone has an exit price.  If BTC eventually hits $1000 or more, the holders will be for the most part a new batch of people (plus those true believers with balls of steel who sit on a massive unrealized gain).
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:02:51
In the DPR Bust warrant, the FBI expressed frustration at the ability of BTC tumblers to obfuscate the identities of wallet holders.  These are almost certainly going to be illegal in the future.  
Your best bet may be to just avoid exchanges and transact directly in BTC to buy and sell goods and services from vendors who won't collect personal information.

BTC has properties of currencies, commodities, and international payment clearing systems.  It is none of those but can replace all of them.
BTC can remain anonymous if you never link your BTC address to your identity, even in communications you believe are secure.  Every BTC knows every address that has ever owned it.
Transaction fees (banking fees) can be avoided by using localbitcoins but the individual seller will probably charge a fee too.
Satoshi is the nickname for the lowest divisible unit of bitcoin, currently 1/1,000,000th of a coin.
Vendors must constantly adjust BTC prices to make up for volatility.  So far this has been rewarded as the value of bitcoins is near all time highs.  No guessing what the future holds, so vendors are taking speculative risks.
The value of a BTC is dependent on many factors, but as long as you own the private keys, they can never be taken and no more than 21 million units will ever be created.  Stable value won't be seen until a level 3 bitcoin economy emerges and goods begin to be priced directly in BTC without exchange rates.

you can use the QT client but it will never sync as it would be offline.  However the addresses it generates can still receive coins and you can use a blockchain monitor like blockchain.info to see the balance of your address from a different online computer.  You won't be able to spend them without either syncing the client (need to go online) or exporting the private keys to another system or an online wallet.

I only know the QT wallet, if you spend only a part of the contents of an address in a paper wallet after importing, the rest will be sent to other addresses in the client.  This is done under the hood and people have deleted their clients (and wallets) in the past, thinking that the remaining balance is still in the paper wallet.  
According to blockchains technical FAQ 
Change is given back to the first address in your wallet.  This may or may not be the paper wallet.

You are correct on the tardness, but my comment was tongue-in-cheek.

Another reason they are just like gold: 
Bitcoin price has done in two years what gold has done since 1973

I would love to see an official US auction of BTC, just for the absurdity of it.

Probably traders moving BTC from exchange to exchange.  Just a guess.

I'm glad BTC monetizes "good" mining.  Double spending with giant stacks of asics would make them virtually worthless as BTC would plunge as well.

You will be forced to pay sales tax when you register it, at least thats the case in California.

public auction after the trial is over.

You were a good spokesperson for trendon shavers, how do you make the jump to being a good spokesperson for people who run away from pump/dump style schemes?

I've been using dwolla-mtgox.  The initial verification was about 2 weeks, but now transfers are done in a few days for a 25 cent fee.  Face to face cash is always the best.  Bitcoin-otc is also good.

What a blockchain fork means in this case is that some clients disagree on the recent history of transactions.  Depending on which fork is longer at the moment and which fork ends up being agreed upon by the network, transactions made in this time frame may end up being nulled.
A technical problem is a huge risk in terms of investment and confidence so I expect the price to fall in the mid-short term.  Mid to long term price depends on how the devs and the mining community handles this.
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:26:47
understood, let me know if you need anymore briefcases of money.

I had a similar experience wearing a professional looking bitcoin polo on a business trip.  US DHS agent asked me about it.  This was right after the SR bust so I was prepared to get grilled but it was really an informal conversation.  I was let go without incident.  Then people on the plane asked what bitcoin was, if I worked for them, and if I had drugs.  I just wanted to sleep.

The 1000 exception does not apply IMO.  reference:
Anyone selling BTC for USD is a MSB regardless of transaction value and must register as such.

He can use bitpay and it won't matter what the price of BTC is.  Then he could choose to convert only a certain percentage to USD or BTC if he wants to hold BTC.
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:23:52
Agreed.  The price of the blades is falling faster than what they would be mining.  Best option in this case is to wait.

I think of it as an alternate reality game which becomes actual reality once a critical mass of people are playing.

Very possible, should be easy enough for a pc homebuilder or even a non-technical person as long as you can follow the guide here:
My 5 GH/S Jalapenos are now running at 7-8 GH/S each after following that guide.

Can you publicly sign a wallet with the approximate amount of bitcoins to back up your claim?
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:41:20
Assuming BTC really gains widespread acceptance, 1 or 2 whole BTC would comfortably put you in the 1%.  
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:53:22
You can always pay it forward to which is an awesome cause.

Yes it would be a great lesson if she has access to a computer.  Give her a couple hundred satoshi to play with (Change her client so it displays satoshis, and she will be super impressed with with a balance of 50,000), let her follow the price, watch the value grow (or fall) together.  Pay her allowance in BTC.  You can teach her about saving, investing, the economy, etc.  Much better investment than a snickers bar.

bitcoin are pokemon cards that cant be copied or faked, and can be sent over the internet.  There are less and less cards being made every year, and humanity has been playing the older version of pokemon since we could count.
