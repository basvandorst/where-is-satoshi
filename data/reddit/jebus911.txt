Almost all of the VC money has went in to new ways to dump bitcoin. Bitcoin is awesome, this whole bubble was bullshit though. People got played by the whales

This is Oleg Gutsol, head of e-residency global growth. He's in the mothership slack, says its a direct quote

Leaked audio from a public room. Thanks man, I know you took a risk getting that
