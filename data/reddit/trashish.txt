I see there’s a certain consensus that we must avoid miner centralization or worst monopoly.  I see people proposing to “regulate competition”  [by changing the rules of the game]( for miners. Couldn’t this cause miner to lose confidence and certainty about long term investment strategies? Couldn’t this be introducing a poisonous policy making attitude in the head of coders?

I think common resources tend to end in tragedy. Land is a finite resource as the 21m bticoins. :-) Distribute,  redistributed but a least give it to someone or it will be negletted or worst badly exploited.

imho the blockchain, in its innovation, has value and is attracting investments in form of fees from unforeseeable reasons and businesses. Those fees are cementing its stored value. May be blockhaining my last will is simply a more primary need than buying a coffee. Why obstructing this?
The day those services will stop “investing their spam” on the blockchain will be the day they’re saying: we believe the bitcoin blockchain is not immutable and resilient anymore or so much.

Yeah, that is what is hopefully happening. I was wondering if there could be an even better way for a government to take advantage of being a determinate first mover and doing things like hoarding Bitcoins and redistributing to its citizens at a later stage according to their savings etc...

Or it’s also possible that Kleimen and Wright used their forensic knowledge and super computer to trace SN and gain access to his email account and started first [harassing/extorting early bitcoiners]( found through SN private email exchanges. That same information would be usefull, now that Kleimen is gone, to decide to impersonate SN and easily bamboozle Gavin. “Hey mate, do you remember that time I wrote to you about…”
