I don't understand. Why are people so eager to pay for physical products with Bitcoins? Are these people from countries where credit or debit cards aren't accessible?

Are there any future plans to lower the transaction fees and time for bitcoin?

I think he’s talking about a possible crash in the US stock market. Don’t know if that’ll help or hurt the crypto market though...

I don't know but my ICX bags are getting heavy, the Koreans were supposed to buy them all up and make it moon by now...

There is a hard limit of 21 million bitcoin that can be mined, ever. So that will have a big effect on the price. With such a limited supply, it's not unreasonable to say (insert figure here) is a low price. The market's sheep are panicking hard right now, but the rebound will be that much more sweeter. 
Edit: it's so cool that someone downvoted without a rebuttal or offering anything of value. If you think I'm wrong, change my view... I'm open to hearing the other side

If they did sell 1%, then doesn’t that mean it’s over and done with? Why are some of the opinion that prices will continue languishing until the truth is found out? At this point I don’t trust that exchange at all and think it’s trivial to just move to another. I guess I don’t see why it continues to have an effect

Bought some at 14.4k, then again when it dipped at 12.1k, then again yesterday at 9.9k. Bitcoin is far from over

That’s like asking, who bought after every other crash happened in the past? It still kept going even when sentiment was low.

Yes, that is true, but it gets harder and harder to mine as time goes on. There's only approximately 4 million left to mine

Why? What’s happening Monday?
