The hash rate looks worse because of the way scrypt is vs sha-256, but Litecoin has a ton of ASICs mining on the network, making it one of the hardest networks to attack after Bitcoin and maybe BCH.  If you're not a fan of BCH, it's the closest thing to Bitcoin that actually works at the moment.  It's not like it's hard to change between between them.  You can set up a website to take Litecoin just like you can with Bitcoin, and it is available on lots of major exchanges.

Yes.  One of their US distributors Blokforge is starting 821 sales on Jan. 12th at 5PM MT, which is 7PM eastern.  I don't think pricing is announced yet though.  It is technically a presale, but it's not like Bitmain where they take 2 months.  You'd probably have it in hand before the end of the month.  They will sell real fast though.  I tried to get my hands on some 741s they put on sale a few weeks ago, and by the time the website loaded properly and I got it in my cart they were already sold out.

Canaan is selling pallets of them on their website for $164,550, which includes 60 miners, 60 power supplies, and 3 controllers.  This makes it around $2,600 a unit for just the miners.  I'm not sure if distributors like Blokforge get any discount, but I'd guess Blokforge would sell for between $2,600 and $3,000.  The price of each batch varies with the price of bitcoin though just like the price of the Antminers do, so the next batch might be more or less than this.
Just for reference, I think the last batch of Antminer S9s went for like $2,700, although they are listed at like $2,350 now.  Maybe they sold a small batch for that price that I missed, not sure.  You have to consider the lost profits of waiting 2 months though when comparing the prices.  Assuming that the network hash rate keeps growing, the most profitable months will be the ones in the near future.  It only takes around 100 days at the current difficulty and bitcoin/USD exchange rate to make your investment back.
When Blokforge sold the last batch of Avalon 741s, they had a maximum (not min) of 2 per person to help their stock last longer.  I think the 821s will be the same.

Canaan Avalons are decent competition.  The new 821 is coming out soon, and is almost as efficient as the Antminers.  While they aren't quite as efficient, they will probably be cheaper, they are a lot more reliable, and you can buy from local official distributors that take credit cards and have already cleared customs.  I'm trying to get a couple assuming they don't sell out in like 2 seconds like the last batch of 741s did.

Some people here shit on Coinbase because of a political decision that they made, but at least if you are in the US, they are the easiest exchange to set up an account, deposit USD, and then send your coins to your ledger nano s wallet.  No, Coinbase doesn't have SegWit right now, but the hardest part of starting out in my opinion is getting verified by an exchange and loading in USD, and Coinbase should be able to do that for you with the least amount of issues.  It will cost like $25 or something in fees, but it will work.
Also, if you don't want to pay fees,GDAX is an exchange run by Coinbase for trading, and they will pay your fee for you to move the coins to your wallet on your ledger.  Once you have coins in Coinbase, you can go on GDAX and transfer all your coins from your Coinbase account to your GDAX account instantly and free since they are the same company.  Then, when you withdraw from GDAX, they will send your coins to your ledger wallet and pay the fee on your behalf.
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:08:14
Actually, Coinbase holds 98% of the coins they hold in cold storage, and the remainder is insured.  It's pretty damn safe compared to many other options out there.  Unless you're using a hardware wallet, your computer can get hacked just as much as Coinbase can.  And since you aren't insured, you're not getting your money back if it happens.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:48:15
Blokforge takes BTC, LTC, BCH, and bank transfers from anyone in the world.  They also take credit cards and paypal from US customers.
The new 821s are 11TH/s at 1200W, which is less than the 13.5 TH/s at 1300W that the Antminer S9s do.  A 841 model with more TH/s will be coming out by the summer as well.  Right now, an 821 will make you around $26 per day and with my residential electricity cost in the US cost around $3.40 per day in electricity.  
For me anyway, the lower performance is worth being able to use a US distributor, having to wait 2 weeks vs. 2 months for delivery, and accepting a credit card I could do a charge back on if something went really wrong.  They also have like a 1% failure rate after 6 months, where the Antminers have like a 10% failure rate.  If you wanted to invest in dozens of miners the Antminers might make more sense for you, but if you're like me and only want a few imo it makes sense to go with the Avalons.  I don't want to risk having my only machine break a day out of warranty and need to be sent back to China for repairs at my own expense, which is hundreds of dollars plus another $150 or so for the shipping.

It's a good stop gap then, but something else still needs to be done if bitcoin is supposed to become mainstream.  I know things can't change overnight, but bitcoin is going to lose a lot of marketshare in the meantime if it has fees many times greater than pretty much every other coin out there.

They are insured though (or so they claim anyway), and they are also based in the US.  An employee stealing all the coins would be the largest theft ever in the US, and they'd be straight to the top of the FBI most wanted list.  If it was based in the Cayman Islands or something, it would be a lot easier to get away with.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:53:17
That's what I thought when I bought one coin for $1000 almost a year ago but pulled the trigger anyway.  It went back to like $750 soon after and I thought I messed up, but look how it turned out.  Who knows if history will repeat, but aside for the one crash in 2013 it has never stayed down for long.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:23:43
I've been in the same boat for a while, but I just ordered a hardware wallet, mostly because it is also very safe but I can get any coins resulting from future forks that Coinbase doesn't support.  Coinbase is huge, they are insured, most of the coins are stored offline, and they are based in the US.  All of those things mean coins stored on there are very safe from hackers, and if they tried to cut and run the FBI would be on their ass in a second, considering it would probably be the largest theft ever in the US.
Still though, while I don't trust my hard drive at all, your phrase can still save you if your hard drive dies, just like if you lose your hardware wallet.  What I don't trust my computer for though is for it not to get hacked, which is essentially impossible with a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:02:21
I didn't say you should cash out before then, as there's no difference tax-wise before or after January 1st.  But if your portfolio isn't properly diversified due to how much the market has changed recently, now's the time to do it.  You don't want all your eggs in one basket, and now's the last chance to fix that while deferring taxes.

Oh, totally agree.  If you're posting on Reddit to validate any knee jerk financial decision, you probably shouldn't be doing this in the first place.  You need to invest with a plan of what you are going to do in any situation, especially one's like this that happen like once a month.

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:36:34
Despite what people say, it is quite safe.  For one, they store 98% of their coins offline, so the most a hacker could get is 2%, which wouldn't be enough to make them insolvent.  Also, they are insured for theft, so even if the 2% got stolen it would be reimbursed by the insurance company they use.  Lastly, they are based in the US, which means the FBI would be on their ass incredibly hard if they decided to steal billions of dollars worth of coins one day.
A downside of having your own wallet with all your coins in it is that you could screw it up.  If you forget your log in credentials or store them on something that gets lost or breaks, you're out of luck.
A downside of holding your coins on Coinbase is that when there are forks, like bitcoin cash or bitcoin gold, they may not support the forks, and you might lose out on the value from the resulting new coins.  Also, if their site crashes, you cannot do anything with your coins until they fix it.  If you are looking to day trade, this could end up screwing you over.  If you are holding long term though, it isn't a huge concern.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:45:37
Still a small percentage, but it impacts anyone who uses bank wires, western union, moneygram, or things like that which all charge much higher fees to send money places.

It could be a group of people.  Also, Coinbase can up your limit.  I'm not sure the max and how it is calculated, but they just sent me an email yesterday saying mine got raised.  I'm not sure if it is because how long I've been with them or how much I have with them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:18:00
Coinbase is insured against theft that is their fault.  So if someone hacked coinbase you'd be okay, but if you gave away the password to your account or something and lost your money then you wouldn't be covered.  And they are based in the US, so if they just ran off it would be the largest theft in the history of the nation and the FBI would be all over them.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:55:09
I mean, by not supporting it they were holding millions if not billions of dollars worth of other people's coins.  I'm quite happy with the $3k I got under my control today...

You can load cash into some exchanges so it is ready to use when you want.  With Coinbase, it is even FDIC insured up to $250k while they hold it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:56:52
I suspect a huge portion of it.  Not so much now, but back when they were a couple cents lots of people forgot about it.  I have a friend that lost what is now millions of dollars worth when it was worth about $20.  It's not an uncommon story, but it is part of the reason the value of the remaining ones is where it is.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:01
It's not the worst news ever.  It just makes it the same as trading stocks, bonds, or other securities.  It was something that was going to happen eventually regardless of this particular tax bill.  And besides, it's taxes you'd have to pay at some point anyway if you ever cash out.
Also, if you trade a coin at a loss, then that goes against your other gains.  You can defer up to $3,000 of losses every year, so if you put a few grand into a coin that ends up crashing and switch it for another, it will cancel out an equal amount if gains when you cash out more profitable coins.  Still though, if you want to rebalance your portfolio and don't plan on cashing out for a while, you should do it before January 1st.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:10:32
The reason you get your money back from a bank if they get robbed or otherwise go bankrupt is because they are insured as an institution.  Your Pounds aren't automatically insured by the government.  If someone steals your wallet out of your car you aren't getting it back.  Same goes for if you leave it in your friend's car and that gets robbed.  You did nothing wrong, but your money is still gone.
Same goes for bitcoin.  If it is held by someone who isn't you and isn't secured or insured, it's just as gone as the cash in your wallet that got stolen out of your car.  Some exchanges are insured, and some are not.  It's up to the user to decide what risks are worth taking.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:14:44
Yes, it would cover you.  It is the same insurance that overs every US bank, and you don't have to be a citizen to use our banks.  It covers you up to $250k if the bank loses your money somehow.  It doesn't apply to bitcoin obviously, but if you put in US Dollars and coinbase disappears or something you will be covered.

That really isn't true.  They keep 98% of their coins offline, they are insured, and they are in the US, meaning the FBI would be on their ass if they tried to pull anything.  They are certainly more secure than an exchange based in the Cayman Islands that is uninsured and doesn't keep most of their coins in cold storage.

Honestly, for most people, Coinbase is safer than holding your own coins.  Every day there's posts about people who got hacked, forgot the password to their wallet, or managed to screw up some other way.  In a world where crypto currency is widely adopted, the vast majority of people aren't going to be holding their own coins.  There's a reason banks exist, and that reason doesn't go away with crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:34:45
You're right, since if you rank people by percentiles of wealth rather than income it has a weaker correlation with how well people are living.

And also, I don't get the end game of some people here.  If Bitcoin became the predominate currency in the world, we'd still have the 1%.  In fact, the wealth would be even less evenly distributed.  The only key distinction is that we would be the 1% rather than other people.  It's not like everyone would just give their Bitcoin out to the poor.  Bitmain would run the world, and no one really wants that.

Robinhood is not going to go bankrupt over Bitcoin.  It's such a small amount of what they do, and they are rolling in cash.  I don't really see how it is that dangerous.

It's less likely to screw you than any crypto exchange out there.

While I agree the fees are too high right now, most transactions at the grocery store already have like a 3% fee in the form of credit card fees.  The confirmation time is a bigger problem which will hopefully also be addressed.  However, for small purchases, the transaction wouldn't have to be confirmed before the person could leave the store.  It leaves room for some fraud, but people also use stolen credit cards and write bad checks.  They are issues that need to be worked out for sure, but it doesn't have to be instant or free for it to be usable in normal situations.

[Here's]( the wiki page on like-kind exchanges.  There was an article from CNBC or something that I read about how it applies to crypto currencies.  The IRS treats them as property, so that's how they are taxed.  It's a little murky, but going between two crypto currencies would most likely qualify as like-kind.
Edit:  [Here's]( a Forbes article that makes it sound a bit more murky.  The IRS hasn't ruled on it one way or the other, so until they do you'd probably want to talk to a CPA about it rather than risk it.

Right now, crypto currencies are treated like property when it comes to taxation.  With the exception of real estate, "spending" any amount of crypto currency is like trading a baseball card or something like that.  If you spent $100 on a baseball card 20 years ago and now it is worth $1000, you owe tax on $900 if you sell it, but nothing if you trade it for another card.  It is considered a like-kind transaction, which means you are only taxed on your gains when you convert to cash or cash equivalents or buy real estate.
The thing is though that the rules will almost certainly change if bitcoin becomes common for every-day transactions.  If the government starts treating it like a foreign currency rather than a piece of property, the benefit goes away.

I think in a prolonged slide in the stock market we'd see more people getting into crypto.  Probably not with all the money they had in the stock market, but maybe as something on the side in hopes of giving their portfolio a boost.  Still though, at a point a sliding stock market would be bad for crypto if the economy gets to a point where people people are losing their jobs or their homes.  Crypto thrives on people with extra cash to throw around.  No sane person is going to dump the money they have left into crypto if they can barely pay their mortgage.

I know Coinbase is sometimes at fault, but I wonder how many of these issues are because people screw up the wire transfer on their end?

Good comment.  It seems like the guy did break the law.  People are all up in arms here, but there's a reason laws exist for banks.  If you're a bank or are acting like a bank, you can't just snap your fingers and say the laws don't apply to you because you don't do anything officially.
Only thing I disagree with is the lawyer thing.  I was in trouble with the feds myself, got a good lawyer, and ended up with probation and a sealed record rather than at least a few years in prison and a felony record.  $500 an hour was definitely worth not being fucked for life.

It's the tried and true buy high sell low strategy, or at least that's what it becomes when people try to time the market like this.  In retrospect it's easy to tell people what they should have done, but at the same time you can bet that people with extra money to throw around are buying at every new low the price reaches.  The reality is that no one knows what is going to happen next.  With the price did last week is not a good indication of what it will do next week.

No one claims the market is random.  However, it is efficient, and if the market sees patterns that indicate something, people immediately capitalize on that information and make it useless.

I'll give it to you that hodl is a dumb meme, but holding investments long term is a sound strategy for investments in general.  People who play the market do worse long term on average.  Think of it this way: playing the market is a zero sum game.  There are a few people with huge amounts of bitcoin that can manipulate the market with the amount that they have.  If they can use that advantage to increase their holdings, that means that everyone else collectively averages worse than if they just maintained their position.  Now, that doesn't mean you should never spend a penny or adjust your portfolio, but if some people have an advantage and you aren't one of those people, it means you're starting from a disadvantage.  If you keep your position relatively constant, you're somewhere in the middle.

I'm pretty sure they already do.  When I've sent coins out of there, I've seen them being grouped with other transactions, and not just the fee.  I forget if it was BTC or LTC, but the last transaction I did was batch with another one that was far too large to be a fee.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:01:33
Lets be real though, the crypto markets are just as if not more manipulated than traditional markets.  It's because there's less people who own a higher percentage of the total market cap.  It's easy for whales to move the market, while it's harder for even an investment bank to move a blue chip stock.  I don't think crypto would benefit from regulation, but regulation does lead to more stable markets and less obvious scams.  Bitcoin's not as bad, but what goes on with some alts is extremely dubious.

Only USD is FDIC insured by the US government.  Your coins are covered by Coinbase's own insurance.
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:29:55
The whole concept of TA relies on the market being inefficient, which there is little evidence to support.  The fact is that unless you are using very advanced computers to detect patterns that no one else can see, you aren't going to do anything with it.  It's because if obvious patterns emerge, everyone sees them and tries to capitalize on them, almost immediately wiping out the advantage.  While someone out there might have the resources to do it effectively, by the time anyone drawing triangles in MS Paint notices anything it is way too late for that information to be useful beyond what simple luck would give you.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:46:12
FDIC insurance does not cover coins at all.  It only covers the USD on there, up to $250k per user.  Coinbase is insured for all of the coins in their hot wallet.  Their cold storage coins aren't covered, but they won't get hacked either.  They could only realistically be stolen by employees, and the FBI would be on their ass in a second if that happened.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:51:44
There are other trading strategies besides using TA.  However, anyone who trades often using any strategy is already starting in a big hole since transaction fees eat up your profits if you make any and don't get refunded if you don't.  There's also big players that can manipulate the market, so everyone who isn't them is going to under-perform the market on average since it is a zero sum game.
As for why capitalizing on information makes it useless, it is because acting on predictions affects the outcome like the other guy that replied to you said.  An easy to understand example is how the prices of most other coins seem to largely rise and fall in lockstep with Bitcoin.  I can observe this, you can observe this, and everyone can observe this.  So can trading bots, and they will immediately start buying and selling whenever Bitcoin makes a move, and leave you with little to no time to capitalize on it.
The biggest dead giveaway that market advice people give based on TA is useless is when they share it with the public.  It's either bullshit from the start, or it was previously useful information that now everyone knows because it is all over Twitter.  Anyone who has figured something out for real is having their trading bots capitalize on it without telling another soul about it.  The rest is either people trying to actively manipulate the market in their favor or people that don't understand what they are trying to do.
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:50:48
What it comes down to is that Coinbase will do a safer job holding coins than 95% of people would do on their own.  A hardware wallet is quite safe, but there's still a chance you lose your seed.  A software wallet can be compromised by malware.

You're not wrong, but if coins were stolen from cold storage it would almost certainly be from an inside job.

For every guy that gets lucky, there's someone else who loses out.  It's all confirmation bias.  The people who make piss poor moves based on the TA they do don't brag about it on Twitter.

This is why.  When you point this out, it tends to bring out the BCH group in force.  I own Bitmain hardware so I guess I'm a bit of a hypocrite, but I wish they had more competition.  I tried to buy Avalon's new offering but they raised the price of the 821 way above the Antminer S9 and the specs were still slightly worse.

Investing long term shields you from the volatility though.  If you buy it with the expectation that in 5 years it's going to be more adopted and intrinsically worth more due to increased utility, the path it takes to get there is irrelevant to your bottom line, even if it tests your sanity.  The only way you actually realize these insane gains and losses is if you keep entering and exiting the market, trying to time it right.  Historically, Bitcoin is like most other investments that on average increase in value over time.  It's a lot safer to just ride it out than it is to try to catch every peak and valley.

People who believe in technical analysis inherently believe that markets are inefficient.  Personally I don't buy it, but that is what they are banking on.

Hell, just the name of the site screams confidence.  Nothing like using the Magic The Gathering Online Xchange to hold tons of your money.

It is when companies do secondary public offerings.  Stable companies try not to, but it's a way to raise capital.  Companies have to sell it to their current investors that the increased capital will leads to gains that outweigh the dilution of ownership.

The only way this makes sense is if you don't consider illegal drugs as wrong.  I'm against the drug war myself, but regardless, what he did is still illegal whether we think it was wrong or not.

A lot of alt coins are straight garbage, but competition is healthy and a lot of alts don't compete with bitcoin directly.  It's smart to diversify and hold more than one coin.

It looks that way when you check some of the addresses.  However, there's no way to tell if some of the money is just the people sending it to themselves from different accounts.  When you look up some of them though, you see tens of thousands of dollars going into the accounts.

Some of these crypto scams make a ton of money fast.  Like, some of the stupid ones on twitter where people send small amounts of coins in hopes of getting large amounts of coins sent back can make tens of thousands of dollars in a day.
