Cybercash doesn't refer to bitcoin, but to Monero.

Look, we get it.  You are a CPA, and these letters went out, now you are trying to drum up business for yourself all over reddit.  Yeah, we get it.
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:06:00
You really dont care, yet you are posting all over the place telling everybody you are a cpa?  LOL, GTFO.  You are the last person I would hire.

You must think the government is super efficient or some bullshit.  Why would the government want to accomplish something with one letter, when they can send three different versions?
@_date: 2019-07-28 14:42:44
The reason for multiple variations is because....drumroll......their data is shit.  BTW, that was a good writeup.  Several things "clicked" for me after reading that.

They stole cash.

This is probably the best property of bitcoin in a sea of really bad properties.

I don't think Finney ever would have tweeted "Running bitcoin", if he was Satoshi.
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:51:21
Yeah, watch the show.  Watch your surveillance coin sink.

Bitcoin is a garbage safe haven asset.  Too easily traced, too many companies tracing it, zero privacy in transacting, zero privacy in amounts transacted.  Bitcoin is easily monitored by government.
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:44:51
Yeah, ok dumbass. How else is price discovery supposed to happen?  lol, fuck.
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:46:50
Correct me if I am wrong, but this does not make bitcoin fungible.  Coinjoin transactions  are identifiable.

Gemini:  An exchange that joins the financial market in fleecing people through high fees which in turn increases monetary friction.  Fuck these guys.

Have fun with KYC/AML to actually get the bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:45:41
This is what should have been done from the beginning with Brave.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:31:55
Enjoy your surveillance coin.

I wonder what sort of things happen on April 1st?
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:52:53
It changes for the better every six months or so.  That is good for everybody who uses it.

Get that Brock Pierce shit out of here.

Shit, these posts get old.

You mean you are trying to convince somebody to have an interest in a surveillance coin? Why would you do that?
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:53:58
Bruce Fenton you goofy fucker.  Whats your favorite thing about Brock Pierce?

Nah, you have to upload identification, etc., just like with an exchange.
From Coinme's FAQ:
Why do you require KYC?
Customer security is a primary area of focus for Coinme. Verification of identity is required to prevent fraud, money laundering, or criminal activity from being involved with the Coinme service and keeps our customers safe. It also adds an extra layer of security by ensuring no one but you can gain access to your account.
As part of our commitment to safety and security, all customers must submit their IDs through our verification process.

These coinstar things are shit.  Just wait until you actually need to obtain the actual BTC.  KYC/AML up the ass.  Exchanges with no KYC/AML are where its at.

This is misleading.  You don't get a tax break on crypto you already own.  Only after establishing residency in Puerto Rico do you get the tax advantage.

A little late, but how do you feel that localbitcoins is profiting off the misery of your people?  Don't you think that is kind of lame, I do.
