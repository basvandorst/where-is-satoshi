Considering most budget GPUs are around that much, you are out of luck. Unless you already have a gaming PC with a GPU inside you will not be able to buy a "rig" but maybe a few dollars a day depending whichever GPU you get, I would start out looking at the GTX 1060

Well you wouldn't want anything too loud so you're probably just limited to a one or two card PC. You could use it also for school work.

Yeah, one of the required settings in the bitcoin.conf is to reindex the whole blockchain, just gonna have to wait, it's normal

A service that let's you send a lightning payment to your BTC address. This then allows for you to receive payment in other channels
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:09:45
My way around this is to send to lightning conductor and receive a Mainnet transaction. This way I can receive back through that channel

That doesn't seem like 5 years worth if you remembered that much of it. An extra character placed anywhere in the existing string.
95 characters * 24 spots it could be in. 
Correct me if I'm interpreting wrong.
