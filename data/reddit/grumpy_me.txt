It's meaningless even if true, what it probably isn't.

Taking financial advice from Kim Dotcom.  
Sounds legit
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:44:42
Hope you wrote it down somewhere
@_date: 2014-10-31 19:48:44
No, it wasn't. Just think about it! A one minute block was worth a random value between 1 and 1,000,000 Doge until block 100,000. That means you could have bought all Bitcoin in existence after ~30 minutes of Dogecoins creation

@_date: 2014-11-01 13:27:32
Think! 
@_date: 2014-12-18 09:48:07
Must be true.  
  
But funny nonetheless
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:33:21
Not comparable. The divisability doesn't change the "character" or overall specs of the coin.  
  
You could compare it to block size, which is changed constantly
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:32:00
That's a matter of implementation. There is no factual limit...
@_date: 2014-12-31 18:34:32
Ppl don't really care, they all hope to sell right before the drop and get rich..
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:56:14
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:35:36
It's a possibility
@_date: 2014-11-23 21:25:34
No.  
To undo a transaction in block  you have to reissue reissue that block without that transaction, and then catch up and surpass the valid chain to make your folk the valid one.
That gets exponentially more expensive the more blocks you have to reissue.   
But to actively attack the network with double spends etc you only need 25% of the network.  
By selfish mining and not publishing the blocks you find, you can create a valid fork, you control, with only 25% of the network.

Are you seriously ignoring, that those people sent 36,913,000 to the government in USD.  
@_date: 2014-11-05 10:48:53
for gods sake, write it down somewhere,
you will forget it!
@_date: 2014-12-05 02:05:14
If that would be possible, you could transfer coins to side chain, double them, send back.   
  
So,... no.  
  
Ps. Bitcoin only exist in transactions.  You receive bitcoin with a transaction, and you send coins by spending that transaction.  
  
In the same way transactions to the side chain, have to be spent to send bitcoin back to the main chain. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 09:58:33


why not?
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:43:51
That's because you don't know what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:33:57
Depends on the fraction.  
  
(Couldn't help myself)
@_date: 2015-05-25 12:32:47
that's a very specific question

"Just the two of us..."
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:55:25
Afaik they can action of anything they get their hands on, without having to ask the original owner. They simply pay out whatever they received in USD if he claims them.
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:46:39
Small errors can cause large losses when dealing with crypto currencies.  
We should be as precise as possible and not tolerate lax behavior.  
Thanks for your info.

This, all the time, all over Europe

Only if the price goes down
@_date: 2015-05-28 10:24:17
Why would you keep sending money to an address that might be compromised, after the first time ?

~~341,51  USD~~

@_date: 2015-08-29 13:32:23
Should have been 241.51....

I  read:  


  
and it made sense to me
@_date: 2015-08-30 11:47:00
They aren't going to seize your credit and debit cards because you have the possibility to cash out more than 10k USD.   
It's idiotic to a whole new level
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:02:21
Because he didn't care to add enough transaction fee, shape shift traded the coins at a loss.
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:06:16
What wallet? 
@_date: 2015-07-25 16:47:34
Just talk to your local bank. Most ideas here are ridiculous.

TdIfsB12$iWi%%=52312&amp;Justice4All doesn't look random to me. It's probably the first letters of some phrase mixed with some other stuff. That reduces the real entropy by a lot...

Uber is centralizing all taxi services world wide
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:19:07
I wouldn't recommend it for ppl who are new to crypto.  
  
In your circumstances you want to keep all your incoming transaction unconnectable.  
  
Not only a new address after each transaction but also washing them afterwards.  
  
You don't want your customers to be able to find out how much you're worth..  
@_date: 2015-04-02 04:42:27
Like, when Reddit got together to get the Boston bombers
@_date: 2015-11-08 09:27:58
You sent the Dollar to Circle and not to your brother.   
  
Long story short. All centralised services collect incoming transactions. Put some coins in cold storage and leave other coins in their hot wallets. If a user requests a payout they use coins from their hot wallet.  
What you did, is send coins to one of their hot wallets.   
It's like placing a dollar on a bank counter and leaving, without instructions.   
@_date: 2015-11-01 14:00:01
just like mt gox
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:43:53
@_date: 2015-11-07 08:52:50
This is a non issue. You are misleading people.
@_date: 2015-10-18 08:16:49
That's a great idea!  
What about you take a pay day loan and buy bitcoin with it, that way you can profit even more!  
Or cash in your retirement money, it will be worthless anyway once bitcoin goes to the moon!
@_date: 2015-03-28 21:59:19
Can you check if bending and movement of the box inside the packaging it's enough to loosen the seals.  
  
Personally I had the feeling that they went of with no effort. And I checked the seals since I found it quite curious.

There are easier and more secure ways to buy 500 to 1000 USD worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:59:09
It should be the other way around. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:45:36
Mine had two untampered seals, :o
@_date: 2015-10-10 11:45:31
Be realistic, that will never happen.
@_date: 2015-10-10 12:21:43
On how you lost 500 to 1000 USD worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:31:30
using the most centralised taxi service that is out there, is a bitcoin thing now?
