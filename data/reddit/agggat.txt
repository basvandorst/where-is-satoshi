Greed is fine. Stealing 100,000 would be greed. Stealing 800,000 is past greed and into lack of self preservation. It would be like stealing all the money in the world (6% in this case) and then immediately moving to mars where you're not going to be able to do anything with your money. Do you think there's any circumstance where he would get to live happily with 1/21 of all Bitcoins? The correct answer is no. 
The most probable explanation so far is a bug introduced into their custom wallet software mid game that started producing invalid private keys.

I'm a little confused. Does this website actually register the username into the namecoin blockchain? Are you able to go to the .bit address of the username you create here? I checked some random .bit addresses that seem to be registered in the namecoin blockchain and you can still create a username for that name on onename.io.
Have I completely misunderstood something?

Realistically Satoshi Nakamoto is:
* 4 to 8 men.
* In their 40's, 50's, and maybe some 60's.
* Most likely they are in a University setting. (There are quite a few good reasons why this makes sense.)
* Degrees/Focus among them probably include Computer Science, Economics, Applied Math, Finance, Cryptography, Distributed Computing.
On no planet is Satoshi one person. The only reason that is even an option is because we don't often associate a username to more than one user.
Bitcoin is deeply layered with extremely complex ideas. Each level requires thorough knowledge and understanding that can realistically only come from a group of people who have been practicing their respective fields for 20+ years.
And they've got all the keys to every last coin.

The fact is, an expert programmer wouldn't have coded it the way it is now. It doesn't follow the current standard for best program design.
Also, it's more than just cryptography that had to be deeply studied. Do you think all programmers just know and understand finance and economics? Money supply, deflationary currency, money minting. These are not just things you can come up with just because you're a programmer.

Stealing that huge amount of coins wouldn't make any sense. It's not discrete, it's not feasible, and it's really just unnecessary. Taking 800,000 and causing this circus vs taking 100,000 and probably getting away with it completely, doesn't make sense.

Nothing is going to be doomed. The people of China wouldn't even know about bitcoins if the the tv networks overseen by their government didn't air a pro bitcoin infomercial. The government may not have taken an official position yet, but it's in their best interest to support bitcoin so as to help displace the U.S. dollar as the de facto currency.
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:20:45
meh. the link to the online addition is fresh. it's good enough.
@_date: 2013-07-08 18:09:11
First of all, I never said devalue. I only said displace as the de facto currency because it's used for trade all over the world and even as the primary currency in some other countries.
Second. Even if the U.S. dollar is devalued it doesn't become worthless. If the dollar did become worthless I think we'd have a lot more problems than just paying back china. But, the U.S. would probably still have to pay back the debt with it's other holdings. Maybe even have a little yard sale. All tanks and drones half off.
Third. After you finish your fancy econ 101 this semester, sign up for English 100.

And I told him exactly that. But you see, he was of little faith and a misguided fool. All I ask now is that you join me in prayer for him so he may yet find the one true path that is Bitcoin. Blessed our God and Holy Father, Satoshi Nakamoto. 
Also. He tried giving me a way out back in September. As you can see, I didn't even dignify it with a response.

Why wouldn't they pay? Banks and other big business just settle accounts with each other. Why can't Bitcoin exchanges? 
And in the end Gox is big because it had volume which attracted more volume. If other exchanges get involved then the volume should get distributed among all the exchanges.

It's in the best interest of bitcoin. It would be good for the exchanges as well because there would be some security in numbers against regulation and shutdowns.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:29:47
It went from 266 to low 100's when i made the bet. I predict between $10,000 and Maximum $100,000 in 2014. Most likely $20,000 to $30,000. We're not moving by ten's of dollars anymore. We're moving by 100's. When we break 10K we'll be moving by 1000s. What do you want to bet?
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:05:00
where did the coins go?
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:53:18
Correct. Unfortunately, what that would have meant was that I would have had to cash out 5 bitcoins at $100 a coin. Fuuuck that.

There are plenty of mechanisms built into bitcoin for this very situation. We can send coins to a neutral 3 party who can't spend them, only mediate by casting a vote 1 way or the other. 2/3 votes gets you the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-24 05:20:59
I think it's relevant. Obviously they should start accepting bitcoin. (If they haven't already.) 
The entire article also reads like "We have this problem you see." To which the obvious answer is Bitcion.

@_date: 2013-04-24 05:51:17
So probably what's going on right now is that all the poor bastards that bought into the inflated $200 price have since been scared off (temporarily). Along with a lot of other potential buyers. What we're left with now are the real men. Those of us who have seen some shit. Slowly as we carry bitcoin on our backs and return it to glory, the boys that previously left us will find a pair of balls and assist us with our noble cause.
Basically once we get back into the 200's all those bitch ass pansies will buy back in and we'll see this shit happen a few more times.

If he bought 1K worth of bitcoin and it died and went to 0, I would have paid him 1K and he would have broken even at worst.

Down of course. You can't expect these gains to be sustainable for too long. We have to spend a little more time at each price point. Get familiar. See how we like it. Spend some $400 coins before we switch to $500 and $600 coins.
