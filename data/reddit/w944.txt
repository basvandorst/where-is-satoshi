Tough crowd here. You seem to be adequately well off to consider 5 btc an easy write off. Since cex is still a centralized exchange, a good letter from a good lawyer could help you to recover more then 0.37 btc especially since they admitted fault. Good luck.

That's a bit of an odd answer from your bank.
If that bank is the destination bank, they should have logs in their system. I mean, the cash has to enter their system, and then they check the destination account and see if it can receive. All the deposit info is the same as your other account, just the account number is different. So they will have logs saying they rejected it. Not having such a thing would be laughable. Go in person to their branch and talk with the branch manager, have them call their internal support if they need, make them work for a change.
As for coinbase not giving you visibility, they wouldn't have any until the return money hits back their system.
Legacy wire systems are a bitch to trace from what I read.

Your bank places a deposit limit on your account?
Ask your bank what happens if a deposit bounces. Ask if they got a deposit recently that they sent back. Call the bank, not coinbase. Not coinbase's fault the destination account has some limits.

I've been thinking about this very question for the past few weeks.
I'm a miner so that might skew things a bit, but here's a rough idea of my plan:
Since I started mining in Dec 2017, I have not broke even yet on the initial/ongoing costs that I put into this venture. So my absolute minimum sale price is when I break even to 100% of invested money. Now that would be with zero profits and is not an ideal solution, but if the prices go sideways for a few years I'll keep holding into this minimum is achieved.
If we do in fact get some nice bull action, my exit point depends on the velocity of the price action. Let me explain. I'm a believer in cycles in the price, and agree with what Bob Loukas is proposing with his 4 year cycles theory. It matches quite well with halfings so that makes sense. According to this theory the next top should be around Summer 2021. However nobody can predict the top timing so I'm going in with some flexibility, and a resemblance of a plan.
I made 4 exit points that would apply well to me in terms of price (portfolio value, not btc price). The most optimistic one has enough for me to sell my coins, pay the taxes on that, and invest the proceeds in some dividend stocks that will pay out annually what I make now in terms of salary: basically enough for an early retirement.
The lowest exit point covers just enough to pay off the remaining of my house mortgage and is about 10x lower then the above optimistic one.
Then there's 2 in between at equal intervals.
So the plan is to first break even, then reach the lowest exit point. At this point is depends on how close are we to summer 2021 and how fast does the price move. If I sense that we could go higher, I'll keep holding until my next exit point, and repeat until my maximum. Reaching my goal is an automatic sale. I've achieved my goal, no need to be greedy further. If however the price tumbles before reaching the next point I'll exit at the one below.
It does sound like market timing in a way, but I set some goalposts so I'm not going in blindly and fomo sell at a random point in time.
And as I mentioned initially, I'm a miner, so even if I sell my stack at any of my 4 exit points, my new stack will restart growing on the same day, and this stack will be for the longer term (~8-12 years).
If I had to summarize, make a strategy that makes sense to you: prepare several exit points, don't be greedy, be content with what the market throws as you and don't try to time the very top as that's impossible :)

@_date: 2019-07-01 16:04:56
Based on the 4 year cycle theory by Bob Loukas the next peak should be sometime in summer 2021, so you should hold at least until then.
He did mention that he believes this 3rd cycle could be the last bull cycle and the next one a big 4 year bear market. So I think this timeframe aligns well with your house purchase timeline.

The payment service will accomplish this by maintaining a private blockchain that records transactions from Square-managed wallets in real-time, allowing the POS system to identify the changed balances before the transactions are written to the public blockchain. According to the patent, this does not completely eliminate the risk of double spend attacks, but it transfers that risk from the merchant to the payment service.
The patent also notes that transaction latency could be eliminated by having user funds custodied by the payment network itself, allowing Square to simply update its internal ledger rather than writing any transactions to the blockchain.
Sounds like you send the coins to your square wallet first and when you use that wallet to pay they maintain a private chain with faster updates so they can do pseudo-crypto payments to the merchants.

The noise is deafening on those. Don't forget it's an industrial machine, not a living room miner.
 
The only way to lower the noise on the cheap is to underclock it and lower the fan rpm. But don't expect it to be quiet. It'll just be a bit less noisy. You can also build some sound isolation box using a cooler but that also will never make it quiet :)

Normal ebit e9 + fan from a antminer s7-ln + noctua na-fc1 fan controller. 
Not sure what's special about the s7-ln fans, but they give great airflow with low noise (relatively). I tried a few aftermarket fans but none came close to the s7-ln fans. 
Then set the minimum hashing speed in e9 web gui, and then play with the noctua controller knob to adjust the fan speed to the minimum speed where the e9's temp is slightly under the max threshold. 
It runs a bit hot because of the lower airflow, but survived the past 6 months so it can take it. Sound level is similar to a 1 gpu pc that's mining. Dramatic difference versus the S9 hurricane I also had :)

Oh, we've got a round earther here!
Tell me, how many satellites have you launched to prove the earth is round?
I could flip the question back to you as well, despite the fact we both agree on the facts that point the earth is round, without having to prove it ourselves. But we're deviating from the topic now. 
I don't claim to be a climate science expert, and am certainly not paid to be one. My expertise is elsewhere. But as long as some scientists bring up interesting theories to counter the mainstream narrative then the science is not settled, and name calling your debating opponents doesn't make you morally superior but rather insecure.
Didn't scientists in 1960s predict a massive climate cooling due to an ice age? Then in the 90s it was global warming. But then that didn't fit the newer data either so they rebranded climate *change*. There, that should cover all angles :)
You mention that modelling the climate is extremely complex, and that's true. Could is be that we still have not mastered it? That we still model based on some assumptions that are incorrect? Garbage in, garbage out as they say.
That correlation between temperature and co2, could it be there is another factor driving both? It seems we're quick to brush aside anything that doesn't fit the narrative.
In the meantime, we're expected to pay up more for wealth redistribution because?
Governments should be able to clearly explain that. And not just tax and tax because mentioning 'Green' makes some people's panties wet and these people will go along for anything as long as it has the label green.

Spread your risk: 
Open 2-3 crypto only accounts at different banks. Pay 1 or 2 bills from each per month for a while. Do a 1000$ deposit to each once. Verify all is good, then transfer to your main bank. Keep withdrawing every time few weeks with bigger and bigger sums. 
Also, do the withdrawals from different exchanges as well. Pick the top 3 and transfer more coins after successfully withdrawing. 
As long as you declare all the capital gains nobody will hit you with structuring. Sadly got to jump through some hoops to reach the legacy system.

I could of paid off my debt instead of starting to mine, but chose mining. With no risk comes no reward as they say :)
It is speculation, but as long as you keep that in mind it's fine. If your crypto speculation doesn't put you in a mortgage foreclosure situation I think you're fine. 
In my case after the initial hardware purchase, I refocused on paying off debt, with only having to pay more for electricity.

How convenient.
Nobody is denying that the climate is not changing. It is changing; until recently all of northern America was covered by a miles high glacier, and it all melted. (No cars back then)
What some are denying is that humans are the de facto reason for this change. And that somehow redistributing wealth by taxing and taxing we'll be able to adjust the earth's thermostat.
Then we have people who mix various topics into one: "Oh you're a climate denier, you must like poluted waters eh?"
What does that have to do with the climate debate? I'm all for cleaner environments and less polution, but some of the people pushing this green agenda appear as being members of some cult that are incapable of individual reasoning, only able to repeat rehashed groupthink soundbites.

I actually dug up some old receipts from last summer and here's an example from Monoprix:
1 chicken breast 7.67€
1 fajitas kit box 5.79€
1 onion 0.37€
1 red pepper 1.22€
1 green pepper 0.87€
Total of 15.92€ for one meal. Not including stuff that we assume one should already have like cooking oil or spices.
A crude average would be
15.92 x 30 = 477.60€ per month for one meal, not including breakfasts or lunches.
I guess you could save by eating more modest things, but I don't know how to your cousin does it for 350 for 3 meals a day. That's an average of 3.88€ per meal. Just the veggies from my example above represent 64% of the price of such a meal.
I guess your lunches subsidies help. 
For example I paid 10.50€ for a Cordon Bleu a emporter, but was told there's some program for French citizens where the government refunds 50% of the lunch fees for employees by using some coupons. But even 5.25€ is above the 3.88€ average.

1200 euros per month for a nurse seems a bit low no?
Especially when last time I was in Paris for a month I spent close to 800€ on just basic groceries.

I once had a work colleague that acted like Craig. Said he used to work at NASA and invented some important shit. Yet was at some crummy customer service job now. He told the wildest stories and everyone around kinda just went along with it knowing it's all lies. But he was always consistant in his lies, having repeated them so many times. I'm pretty sure he believed 100% what he was saying.

Don't take a loan. If your day job pays the minimum, paying out that loan will make you go under and create other problems should bitcoin go sideways for a while. Quick uptrend is not guaranteed. 
You are definitely going all in on this. It's not bad per se. Some say don't invest more then you're willing to lose, but 1) with no risk comes no reward and 2) if bitcoin is still an experiment it's not really an investment, but gambling. Which is fine either way, just keep that in mind. 
As for your question, there's no rush to get the most coins. You already have a day job. Great. Buy some bitcoin from every paycheck. 
Picking up a side gig works too, but requires extra time commitment to learn new things. With you working overtime it's going to be challenging.
Try getting a job upgrade. Learn new skills to get a promotion at your current place or a different place. Then you'll have more money to buy more bitcoins on every paycheck.

Learn the basics about amps, volts, watts and the standards of your country. 
Then calculate how much your s9 will use. 
Pay to have a new circuit added to your electrical panel that will support the amps you have calculated in step 1. Don't blindly plug them in the wall without doing calculations first or you might fry wires or breakers. 
Buy a PDU so you can plug multiple s9 onto one circuit.

Whatever you decide, I advise the following:
1) Order your hardware wallet now. Tresor or Nano S. They'll be ready for when you decide to buy (don't keep coins on exchanges)
2) Start with a small amount like 0.1 btc. So you get the hang of how transfers work, storage, seed restores, etc. Then some time later buy the remaining 3.9 btc

Except his question is a basic math question that's taught before grade 7 and has nothing to do with wallets and stuff.

Do you have the freedom to legally do any kind of drugs in the US? No. Why? Because they were made illegal. Thus your freedoms have limits. And these limits can be imposed arbitrarily by your government overlords. 
Bitcoin is no different. They could ban it for any number of flaky reasons. From terrorism funding to tax evasion or inability to be regulated. 
Now whether you would obey those laws is up to you. So in that sense you always have freedom.

These companies that you named are accepting payments from an intermediary that will accept crypto on their behalf and pay them in fiat instead. You of course need to deposit your crypto to that intermediary first. 
So not really 'accepting bitcoin'. Just another rent seeker that places itself between you and your transaction peer.

Hehe, funny you should mention silver. I held it for 5 years after the bubble, then sold at a loss. Then jumped into crypto. Same 5 years timeframe. This time I hope it pays off :)
