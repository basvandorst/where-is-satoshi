Post the details of the interactions and the transactions that you had with the scammer. Post the address that you sent the coins to, someone might be able to track it.

Question for the Bitcoiners, would you be likely to support this type of enterprise if they accepted Bitcoin? Zidisha does microlending to entrepreneurs in developing countries.

Doubtful. It will not become the default gambling currency in Vegas. Have you met tourists? Especially Vegas tourists?

Why don't you just sell it and take the cash?

Many of the larger pools offer merged or multicoin mining which is huge draw for miners. Though information on how to easily set up one of those types of pools is virtually nonexistent and requests for direction to those resources or help is derisively dismissed.

It would be nice if their editor took a quick second to check how Fremont is spelled.

What it looks like is that Satoshi Dice is semi-operational and not taking care of their webpage. And, because Blockchain allows users to send money directly to Satoshi Dice, this reflects badly on Blockchain.

Do you have a link?
@_date: 2014-01-05 22:55:09
The IP is located in Vegas, perhaps this is something that the Bitcoiners in Vegas can look into or should be reported to the police.
@_date: 2014-01-06 08:18:16
Yes, there is a link and boxes to send money to Satoshi Dice under Send Money / Games.

Imagine if your bank had a link to this mangled website and had a page where you could send money directly to this website. Wouldn't it make you question the thoroughness of your bank?

Even if they guy is just incompetent, with the way everyone is talking about hunting him down and making him pay wouldn't you go into hiding?

I was at the Inside Bitcoin conference in Vegas and asked Bobby Lee this question after the session. He said that a solution like Bitpay wouldn't be allowed in China because it is still using bitcoin as a currency.

Was it too far off of the radar for Paypal to pay attention to it?

She's from Tealet, a local Vegas company that accepts bitcoin. She's awesome. I met her at the after-party the Vegas bitcoiners threw last night.

Look at his other articles, he's a professional curmudgeon. He probably eats babies and has his coke dealer on speed dial.

Totally understandable. Thanks for taking the time to respond. I actually like the service and the app. I wouldn't be complaining about it if I didn't.

How do the FAQ pages load on your phone's browser? Are you able to get into the categories?
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:14:38
That lists addresses which can be a helpful number, but we all have multiple addresses. It would be interesting to know how many owners there are, especially with the growth in China.
If there was some sort of reference-able number of owners it could be used to court businesses to use it or investors to invest. "There are 6 million owners / users of bitcoin." vs "There are 11 million bitcoins." or "There are 11 mililon bitcoin addresses."
I know that it is impossible to know exactly how many owners there are, but an educated estimate isn't impossible.

Vegas is a nice place to live. There is great hiking, cheap housing, people from all over the world, great food, great entertainment, and the weather is nice most of the year. 
Disclaimer: I was born and raised in Vegas.

Regardless of how reputable they are.It is a pain in the ass to get USD into.  
  
- Interkassa is Russian only.  
- Perfect Money charges 8% and are based in Panama.  
- BitInstant doesn't work with BTC-e anymore, evidently because of a hack.  
- OKPay is 2% and I am still waiting for verification with them. They are based out of the Bahamas.

Andreas was lightening! He stirred emotions and put a worldwide perspective on bitcoin. The great thing about him is he appeals to both the libertarians and the liberals.

In order to do this I need my bitcoin to be as easy to use as my credit card. I need to be able to use it to where I shop and for buying more than trinkets, gift cards, and gambling.

Are you using a VISA? That is the only kind that will work.

Nice. It would be cool if you could plug in values, like preev.com

I wore jeans yesterday and I'm going in a suit today. I didn't feel judged or discounted because of it. It depends on what your goal is. If you want to be taken seriously you have to play the part for people with money and power. 
Say you are putting 8 million dollars on the line by investing in surety insurance, payment processing, mining equipment, or a bitcoin ATM. Wouldn't you have try to minimize risk?  A new wacky unknown like bitcoin already has a lot of perceived risk. Giving your money to a person who appears to not put a lot of thought into their clothing can increase perceived risk. 
I'm not dissing on casual clothing, just attempting to say maybe that was other people motivations. They wore appropriate costumes for their goals, but the costumes don't define who they are.  I went in jeans yesterday because I had a different purpose than I do today.

The "I haven't had any problems" responses don't contribute anything valuable to the conversation. They are only slightly more sophisticated than the "to da moon" posts. Any software or website will have people who have problems and people who do not. The problems that I've listed are with the app and the website. The issues that I've listed are clearly defined and are easy to reproduce. A finished product shouldn't have such problems with basic usability.
To the "I haven't had any problems" posters, we get it. You don't care that we have issues with a service / product that you like. Likewise, we don't care that you haven't had any problems. It doesn't make the problems that we've found suddenly not exist.
