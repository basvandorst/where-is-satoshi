MAPs Charity in the UK is getting pushed out of their building because the landlord wants to redevelop into luxury flats. The charity is trying to buy the house. Pineapple fund would help them out so much!

Ah ok so the hash rate can be used as a way to look at how much interaction there is with bitcoin around the world? so when you said wow look how high the hash rate is, you where using that as evidence for bitcoin's health being in a good placen at the moment?

That circus clown, has done some fairly interesting things when it comes to drawing attention to itself. In times like this we need to draw attention to the comments that are being made about this new legislation. Having a clown around might be very helpful!

ISIS have begun to sell oil from the Ajeel oil field, but this is coming from the Iraqi government so it might be scaremongering for more support.

Click is fairly big news in the UK tech scene. Nice to see Bitcoin adopting businesses getting some coverage from a mainstream media outlet like the BBC's click

all the links on the website that I clicked on worked for me?
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:40:25
What about if they are selling thouse bitcoins for goods and services and not fiat? does this make the value of bitcoin increase or decrease?

I'm starting a website that is going to be strictly based on crypto currency as the payment method. Has any one had an experience with integrating payment platforms into their websites that allow them to take bitcoin as payment. I have tried coinbase but they only work with US bank accounts which isn't any good as im based in the UK.

dyslexic reddit user alert i cant find it...help a brother out?
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:59:08
Thanks allot for walking me through that i really appreciate your time and patients  
@_date: 2014-09-04 15:01:37
I wasn't asking for your advice on whether it is a good idea or not....
@_date: 2014-06-19 16:05:44
Ah do you mean this subreddit? i guess that was a stupid question to ask to this subreddit....
@_date: 2014-07-19 07:22:35
I'm sure the protest would be a great way to get some attention, can you think of anything that can be done by us that live outside of America? This right here is what crypto's need if they are going to get anywhere, enough of the childish i'm on team doge or i'm on team bitcoin! fuck that, time to grow up and coordinate. Thanks for having the sense to reach out and bring out two communities together!
@_date: 2014-06-03 10:57:32
Ok so its to do with the mining of bitcoin. The higher the hashrate the more computing power that is being used to mine bitcoin, which in turn increases the difficulty?
@_date: 2014-07-19 08:44:23
I agree with you that this is grown up stuff but you never know this could be the coming of age for crypto's. If we can foster the right sort of communication and coordination across the different crypto-communities then we might just see a reasoned and well executed response with the legislators of america to ensure that crypto currencies are given fair regulation? What do you think am i being too optimistic? 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:09:26
Apple news me thinks

I think that when you apply the idea in this article to other things its likely to hold true to what the author was trying to point out with the analogy of war. Take for example climate change, if you dislike the way that your government's legislation such as subsidies affect the type of energy production that is used in your country. Then using crypto will take away some of that economic power to subsidies or give economic incentive to 'dirty' energy production? Does this make sense or am I not being realistic?

This is a great infographic thanks I kind of had this in my head but couldn't articulate it to other people now I can just send them this link 
@_date: 2014-07-02 10:00:44
Why is this not on the front page of reddit, great Bitcoin press, and more importantly this is your chance as Americans to fight back and your letting it slip! 
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:12:13
Well i dont like your positivity! 
Ok so we invent massively powerful AI, and this AI decides that we as humans are taking up too much of the worlds resources for our own pitiful needs or that oxygen which is essential for human life leads to too much rust on said AI's parts. So this AI decides fuck these monkeys and sets out to ruin us. If by this point the world is operating on digital currency systems (which i hope it is) wouldn't it be really easy for AI or a government in control of a powerful AI (to use a little less crazy example) to manipulate the system to its or their own advantage 
@_date: 2014-09-04 15:02:21
Thank you very much for these, i have spent the day enjoying these links! 
@_date: 2014-07-08 22:58:57
Also it must be noted that ISIS are currently holding a number of highly valuable Iraqi Oil fields, as well as having stolen like 200 million from some bank........yeah the bitcoin donations are really whats keeping them afloat, did they really think we where this stupid? 
@_date: 2014-07-02 09:54:14
Just donated, im not American but your system is fucked. I don't understand why that is not fully funded?? 
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:12:30

He was trying to get informative and positive questions upvoted for the benefit of all who where going to take part in his AMA. Although he broke a rule, he did not break that rule for his own gain, he was simply trying to get the people here at involved in his AMA in a positive way. 
I think this transgression can be pardoned surely?  
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:19:45
A real contrast to how these sort of events have gone down in the past. Nice to see good practice being employed by these types of websites
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:59:36
There is a project along these lines. It's called bitquence. Check it out

Yeah, I was shocked when I saw that it was his 6th Xmas inside. Now imagine how slowly the last 6 years have gone by for Ross.
