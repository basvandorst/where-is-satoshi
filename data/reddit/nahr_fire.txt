By what metric are they a dying company?

I've found escrow to be effective as security. But a trusted escrow service can be difficult to find depending on what you're buying.

Yeah it seems it's a term used for multiple different philosophical studies. I was mostly trying to use it the same way Immanuel Kant used it, which is to say when making a moral decision we must determine if the maxim we are prescribing is effective if we were to universalise it. 


Furthermore, this type of logic is very common and you'll notice it in many areas; from classroom teachers prescribing to students "if everyone acted like you were nothing would get done!" to vegetarians taking solace in their dietary choices effecting the world as while they can't have a meaningful impact through their own agency, society as a whole can.




So here we can see that the *aggregate effect* being referred to is this principle of universalizability while the response is a typical consequentialist take on the justification.

Universalisation doesn't make strict logical sense but it is a convincing principle for many people throughout  the world.
