Lots of the people who are anti-Gavin's proposal are not anti bigger blocks, but anti-forever inflating blocks. I personally believe we need far larger blocks, but that transactions do need to be at least moderately scarce.

If there are infinitely large blocks, there would likely be no real competition to get into blocks. Therefore most people wouldn't pay fees. 100,000,000,000 * 0 = 0
Of course, in reality it wouldn't be 0 but the idea is that if the block-size is close to the actual number of transactions (slightly under), to ensure quick processing people will pay small fees. 100,000,000,000 * 0.02 = a big number.
@_date: 2015-05-25 15:26:42
I don't think many people are particularly concerned about the storage/cpu requirements etc. Its arguing against a strawman.

Because security is directly pegged to miner income, and larger blocks reduce incentive to pay fees to miners. Reaching the limit requires development of alternative systems and leaving transactions at a premium. I know I for example am not against an increase in size but it must always be thoroughly in demand.
@_date: 2015-05-25 17:37:39
You started this with an assertion with no backing.
The ones I have spoken to care about the lack of incentive to include fees with high block-sizes, and the lack of incentive to develop other scaling solution (i.e lightening).

That is not relevant, we're not talking about how easy it is to store but the total value of fees being enough to secure the network moderately well.

Announce your business plan. If you think your business plan has to be kept secret because otherwise others will steal it you are probably too stupid to be in business (not just BTC, but in general). 
Let me explain to you how business "stealing" works: at the time MPEx was created (Feb 2012) there existed GLBSE already, which sucked at that time. Nobody flailing around in a cloud of stupidity almost mould-like in consistency seemed to be aware of it, but GLBSE sucked. And so Mr. P decided to make a securities exchange that worked right and was run correctly. 
So, pro tip  there's so much to do and so few people capable of doing it in Bitcoin that if your plan makes sense and you seem even remotely competent everyone else who is competent will breathe a sigh of relief. They aren't going to "steal" your idea of doing the absolutely fucking obviously banal, cause so much is needed I couldn't begin to tell you.
Pro tip  if you are incompetent, the people who are competent aren't going to steal your business early. They are going to steal it late, just like MPEx demolished GLBSE. They don't need early mover advantage, they will come to your market six months or a year late, break off your arms and beat you over the head with them until you are reduced to a bloody mess. 
So, forget about anyone "Stealing" your business. When S.DICE was announced, a bunch of forum muppets rambled on about how it's not worth its valuation because "everyone could do it". And I laughed at them then and so to prove my point that they're laughable idiots they declared that they shall do it! It's been months, who has managed to steal the business? You can't steal any business from the competent, and if you're competent yourself you don't even try to, cause it makes no business sense.
Thus, at the very least, step 3 gives you this measure of protection, whereby other competent people know you're doing X and so don't start doing X too. It saves our time and effort, rather than doing something twice do two of the fifty billion things that still need doing. 
Obviously your announcement will gather a bunch of crap from a bunch of nobodies. But lucky for you, you've been doing this by the numbers, and you have the list. You know why you don't care what Joel Katz says about anything: what people who don't run businesses say is irrelevant. You know why you care what piuk says about anything to do with the blockchain (do you?).

Because in theory people could stop paying if they aren't competing to get in blocks. Its not really an issue now because almost all the payment is the new bitcoins, but in the future fees will actually matter. I don't think anyone is suggesting we never raise the blocksize, just that it needs to be set not inflationary

I would say that stability has really got very little to do with decentralization, but volatility, market-cap, and liquidity do - in the future we will see an exchange that should be handling liquidity very well (hush). At this point in time an elderly man who worked his whole life to save a pension could be a whale, let-alone hedge-funds and similar cash-pooling schemes.
Basically, as we get bigger, we will get more stable.
However, through some centralized services we can offer low-cost stable BTC storage - for example pegged to USD/GBP/whatever 
~~altcoin~~ federally insured and taxable currency you so choose.
I disagree with Aant, bitcoin is more useful at a higher price, and it is an increase in price that will increase the number of users (not the other way around as some would attempt to argue).
In the end, it will be greed that causes bitcoins' success.

Exactly, that is what I'm saying. Most exchanges offer direct access to big clients so they definitely will give themselves direct access when doing on behalf of big clients.
We have four interfaces for working with our exchange. RESTful, WebSocket, FIX, and a binary protocol. Using binary protocol while using on-site hosted hardware would make your transactions *far* faster during periods of high volume than using other systems.

We need more fee subsidies - not the same level.
If today we were to no longer have fee subsidies, the network would become very insecure - a way needs to be found that meets the sweet-point of transactions being relatively low-cost while there is enough incentive for miners without the block reward.

Is it feasible? Yes. Would we want to do it? No.
Why? See below

Not very, as for recommended wallets if centralized I would say CoinBase vault, but ideally your own wallet!

Ah thats true, I assumed exit for some reason! Although there are still some bad things that can happen just from being a relay (if you do a lot of data, your ISP will likely cut you off, against T+Cs)

They had access to evidence gained prior to being moved off the case, and a motive to alter it - a good lawyer will at least be able to cast a large amount of doubt over any evidence gained during their involvement. Especially when you consider they almost certainly still had access *after* being moved off the case.

I find it hard to believe how confused some people are about why Paypal sucks. Just to make it clear I too hate Paypal, but their solution/reason it sucks is wrong. Lots of uneducated opinions in that thread (and I do mean uneducated as opposed to "disagrees with me").
Paypal has very little competition, because they are one of the only companies where you can make payments to *almost* anyone of importance in the world (not that people in Africa aren't important, but I don't need to do business with most of them). Their shady business practises wouldn't last very long if there were companies they had to compete with.
This is from [Peter Thiel's interview:](


So today, lets say you want to start off in just the major economies (sorry, had to exclude a couple of places like China because I know little of their laws). Where do you need to be licensed?
**United Kingdom:**
Technically you can be licensed anywhere in Europe but this is where most Fintech companies choose to get licensed in Europe. You have the best access to lawyers, FinTech thinkers, etcetera in London.
This comes under Electronic money regulations, and once licensed you can passport your license for free to the rest of Europe, as well as Switzerland. This will cost you a £5,000 fee (tragic) and you will have to prove that you hold 350,000 euros in liquid capital. Fairly reasonable but of course you have legal fees, and restrictions on what you can do (for example you cannot pay interest).
You have a number of reporting requirements but nothing too heavy, really all you have to submit is suspicious activity reports. (Over simplification, but that is the main one).
This process will take around 6 months.
**United States:**
You need 50 money transmitter licenses, and need to be a federally registered money service business. There are a large number of fees/capital adequacy issues. Most states require that you put funds into a special account that you cannot touch. 
The whole process takes years to become fully compliant. For example [Pre-Cash]( started gaining their licenses in 2006 and gained new licenses as recently as *2014*.
Reporting is a nightmare, have to report which direction the wind is blowing when a customer walks through the door.
You don't actually need to get a license, well done Canada!
You need to become a licensed Financial Service, there are two levels of this - Wholesale and Retail. You can have just a Wholesale license which allows you to accept customers who meet the following criteria:
































You need to have professional indemnity insurance, and be part of a dispute resolution that ASIC has approved of.
Fees are pretty low on this one, less than $3,000 initially. However reporting is a different matter, you have to report an awful lot of stuff. Every transfer over x amount, etc. Can be automated though, mostly.
**New Zealand:**
Sort of regulated, sort of not. 
You have to register yourselves with the CO, however there is no licensing of the such.  You need to register with a dispute resolution scheme if you want to accept retail customers.
I don't know much about reporting here, sorry.
Its pretty easy to get registered, in fact Bitcoinica was registered in New Zealand.
And the best part? With all of these countries you must have an active staffed office, with senior members working at it. Of course, this is a very short list, with just the countries I've taken a glance at, but the list goes on. Most countries have licensing requirements - in Pakistan of all places it costs $2,000,000 to become licensed - and that is not as a bank! South Africa, Mexico, Japan, they all have their own requirements.
And then you have risk. Banks are so over-regulated that they shit themselves whenever something is any one of the 50 shades of grey. Paypal found it easier to become a licensed bank in Luxembourg to accept debit/credit/other Euro payments than to work with banks directly as they could keep correspondent relations rather than current accounts.
And then you get people who say shit like this:


Bravo, you dipshit. Lets take a market that is already full of crony-capitalism, and further increase barrier to entry. Someone get this guy a Nobel prize. There is complete disregard for the actual functions a bank performs.


So. Many. Licenses. No you can't have one. Hate on Paypal, but please keep it accurate.

Nakamoto Institute, Qntra, Sian Jones, those are the best off of the top of my head.

Bit-X just created one, but they look pretty bloody shady to me (pretty pictures aside). There are companies working on it, other than XAPO who won't deal with people in the US (more accurately their card issuer won't because the USG is fascist)
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:18:00
Nakamoto Institute deserves far more credit than they get.

Thats a really bad idea on your home connection, good luck going on any site with CloudFlare, receiving cease and desists etc.
Far better to do it in a server environment where possible.
EDIT: Was wrong, they said relay not exit. Still though, better to do on a business connection than a home connection
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:19:36
I don't know, USG has a pretty bad reputation of doing things that aren't technically considered corruption but by moral standards would likely come under it, for example invading half the world and destabilizing governments in South America/Iran/Wherever.

Thats not true, they sell at a premium on OTC markets - they don't hold more currency risk than they need to.
