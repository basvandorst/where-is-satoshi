Yea this is awesome.

I almost agree, its just that there are a whole lot more bitcoiners who prefer the other name, including the ones who started the project. We're going to have to see which one works out.

Sorry this happened to you dude, a lot of people are dealing with the same thing. Read a post last night about a guy paying $13 in fees for a $20 donation to charity. Full disclosure I'm in support of scaling on chain, but crypto politics aside it always feels pretty wrong to hear things like this. Everyone will tell you to change wallets but that's not a real answer either. Every month fees will continue to climb higher until L2 solutions are in the wild and you can transact off chain.

This is the old "corporate" way of thinking where names and other information can be owned. Nobody is allowed to compete for Nike's name because it's legally owned and backed up by government force. Here there is no ownership. There is no force. There is only pure competition. In this analogy those Niikes wouldn't be counterfeit, they would be a valid competitor even if it is a stupid name / riding coattails or whatever else. If they suck, nobody would stock them (exchanges, etc), and nobody would buy them (market cap). Bitcoin was designed to resist being controlled.

Refusing to recognize the other side's investments and contributions to Bitcoin will lead you to that conclusion. The truth is these guys are actually some of the first people to work on and proliferate bitcoin.

You have every right to make that choice, I'm just pointing out its an unreasonable expectation. You want a business to make a name change that is vindictive in nature (if it was about noob safety we'd be hearing about bgold).
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:52:07
You can't always get what you want, especially when what you want is vindictive. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:29:20
Funny that  is Bitcoin Gold all spelled out. Clearly this is all about confusing newcomers.

You hit the nail on the head. The only thing keeping my private keys private is that I keep them to myself. As soon as an idea (information) is in the public it is no longer owned. 
"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it." - Thomas Jefferson
Jefferson also advocated granting temporary patents, but that is where the government force comes in. Bitcoin doesn't have that part, so the system defers to its natural state.

The "downside" of a network with no leader is, nobody owns its brand name. This is actually a strength of bitcoin because forks can emerge and if the main chain was to become corrupt for any reason, bitcoin can re-appear unscathed.

OB was BTC only for a very, very long time and thrived on the spend &amp; replace mantra of the early days. They started strong but numbers went backwards when the BTC community entered the "do not spend BTC" phase. Their platform depends on spending. If anything I'd say the Bitcoin crowd dismissed OB, not the other way around.

lets be honest. not being able to close your channel is not good for the user, which is not good for Bitcoin. How is this not obvious?
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:09:46
me too pls ;)
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:16:54
Surprised how many people think "this will leader to better decentralization". That hash power is not going to disappear or change owners.

but I'm talking about buying things directly in bitcoin say on openbazaar or amazon stuff via purse.io or gift cards. What about then?
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:56:49
buy the dip, on the next ath spend on stuff you would have bought anyway, note how much $ to replace on next dip. repeat.
BTW does the above remove tax implications? I'm technically not "cashing out" or realizing profit? or am I?
@_date: 2017-10-08 11:11:00
it doesn't work without a 3rd party arbiter or escrow involved. craiglist is a scammers paradise as it is.  Openbazar is the replacement so far.

I have that shirt but mine is all faded now. Good thing with this one is, I can reconstitute it with sharpies and it will literally look like new.

These guys are doing it:
Website doesn't have any info but here's an article:
They try to solve the adoption problem by requiring users unlock each new city. Until there are enough people ready to use the service it doesn't go live. So far it's being used in Austin TX, not sure where else.

`Big Blockers however seem to be okay with centralization` cmon really? I've read many posts and articles by big blockers exploring the centralization risk of segwit too. Whether or not either is true, its definitely not true to say one side or the other is actually supporting centralization. Destain for centralization is something that should unite both sides.
`that would make bitcoin no different than PayPal` we don't have segwit now, does that mean bitcoin is no different than paypal? obviously not true
put down the pitchforks and try to understand where the others are coming from and we'll all be a lot better off. When you go over the top people stop listening and trolls win the internet.

New dad here. Also feeling pretty good about the correction. Here's to lowering my cost average. This is my black friday.
