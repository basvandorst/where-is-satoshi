Quickbooks? Really? I wasn't aware they had support for bitcoin yet. I'll need to look into GNUCash.
Thanks!

That's a good question. How do you do that?

As a guy who works retail, thats all it takes for people to never come back in your store and go a cross the street to your competition.

Ahh government entering into the economy. Because that's where looters and liars like them truly belong.

Do I have a PhD in economics? No. Do I need one to see that income tax is a blight on mankind? No. Income tax is a tax on intelligence. A punishment for being to successful. Taking the wealth you and I produce by force and making into whatever twisted dream the government wants, like bombs or free colleges that will actually cost billions.

I've had a bottle of oil thrown at me because their weren't any registers open for me to check the man out. He threw it at me and walked next door and became O'Riley's problem. I wasn't punished. We laughed at him. Especially consider that $4 purchase that he was going yo make was behind a $3,000 transmission. So no loss for us.

Now we could just make the idea of an income tax irrelevant and just kill it too that would be nice

Because you can trust the same people who destroyed the dollar with thr safety its successor.
