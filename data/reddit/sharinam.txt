Brave was a pioneer of a crypto browser. Theres no doubt they're doing some great stuff in the privacy matter

This wasn't even convincing at the slightest

Nothing related (kinda) 
Deutsche Bank laid off a lot of people and a picture went viral with a man walking out with a bag that said bitcoin.

Being digital is fundamental to many areas - from ecommerce to publishing to supply chain and more. In this regards, I think the technology is making huge leaps for sure.
For example, Brave, an open source web browser, will soon be able to tip creators on reddit and Vimeo. This is **incredible** because it would allow content creators to reduce their dependency on ads, which inherently tends to reduce UX while surfing the web.
I think with any new innovation comes challenges - but the future of Bitcoin / crypto is quite fruitful IMO.

Think 20k will be the new bottom? Feel like its relatively small compared to the interest being generated
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:22:16
I'm thoroughly enjoying it yes
