@_date: 2019-07-18 03:55:25
It will go to the moon when you all stop selling for a loss when I drop so much bitcoin on the market at once that I can buy more back moments later so just let me know when you’re ready to stop selling no matter how much lower the price goes from when you bought in and then I’ll know I can’t play that shit anymore and we can both ride the wave to 1 mil BTC, the only question is how much are you going to let me have before then. Kthanksbye. Signed, EveryWhale.

How did you get that 75% ?
The solution of thin air you come up with ignores the fact that you have 75% which you seem to have gotten out of thin air. Bitcoin has value from the energy people expend to keep the network secure. Miners are rewarded for that.
Did you spend millions and millions of dollars paying for electricity and earning 75% of all mining rewards? 
Well okay, now you sell it and crash the market and you got your millions back, only other smart people were buying as you were crashing it so when you try to buy back, you might end up with less than you had before. It depends on how bullish or bearish people are. If it drops 70% I’m going to buy more than I normally would. If it drops 90% I’m buying a LOT more, so good luck trying to get your 75% back when the market recovers. Whales can and do make huge splashes from time to time. They can accumulate more by doing so, but sometimes they end up losing out by trying to trigger a panic sale that fails. 
Did you buy 75% way back when it was very very cheap? 
Well good on you, you get to decide to either crash the market or slowly withdrawal your wealth by selling off some of your assets over time as demand grows instead of trying to fill all the demand at once.
Hope that helps

If you have the time and additional funds, you can set increasing buy orders if the price is dropping at periodic points and sell orders too, so you can catch those dips for what you want to spend if they hit that point. This is better than actively watching the price as it removes the emotional fear and / or greed aspects. I.e. you won’t be tempted to wait for a better price and to buy and risk the sharp up swing

Maybe if you stopped looking at it as an investment and saw it as another currency you'd see the flaw in your logic. How is any of this different than exchanging dollars for, let's say, Yen. You would have to then admit that all money systems are a Ponzi scheme, only with traditional currencies it's the central banks who are the ones profiting. But wait... Those guys got a better racket anyway, they just print more money out of thin air and sell it to all the suckers out there. Now compare the two. Does Decentralized currency still seem like some 2-bit scam? 
If so, sorry you feel that way. I tried.

"How do you hang on to such a thing?"
Do you believe that this will one day be a global currency? If yes: FOREVER. If no: When you need the cash.
No one can predict the future, but looking back at the price history and what happens after old highs are surpassed... well it might just take off again.
Or it might not.
Personally, if my goal was to pay off a huge chunk of a house (or even the whole thing) and I had enough invested where that could happen in the next 6 months, then I would say it's worth the risk to wait. You're up 4X how about adding a 0 to make it 40X?
Good luck!

Well, no not exactly. You will have a recovery key, usually converted to a pass phrase of several words you can write down or just memorize if you're a maniac. You can store that in a safe location.
Remember, Nothing physically lives on a device. As long as you have the recovery key or phrase you can restore a wallet. That should be stored in a very secure location, or in a way that no one but you would know. I keep a small amount on breadwallet for iOS and have changed devices several times without an issue.
For example, there is a way to convert the key into the order of a deck of cards, and that deck order could be duplicated and the decks stored in a few places. It would be impossible for anyone to guess that the order of a deck was your key, but if you ever needed to recorder you can easily revert it back. There are dozens of small tricks like to to discreetly back up a key.
Also, you can have as many wallets as you like. Some people keep the bulk of their holdings in one then use a phone based wallet or an online wallet for spending. It's not complicated once you make the jump

Congrats to your friend on holding from 50
One idea: Have him figure out what he can afford monthly with current income, some amount that won't put a strain on lifestyle.  Use a calculator to figure out how much house that can buy, taking into account closing, taxes, and other fees. Cash out 20% that amount and use it for a down payment to avoid having to carry PMI. Now your buddy would have a decent home that will appreciate, an affordable monthly payment, while still keeping a majority of his holdings still in BTC during this critical period where the price may continue to climb to new highs.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:07:49
Would you still be pissed if it were phrased differently?
Something like: "We're out of our normal stock. You can buy at the regular price and receive it within 30 days. We're sorry about this delay! However, we understand that some of you may need one much sooner. If that is the case, we do have a a few in reserve. These are usually set aside in case there is an issue with new stock arriving on time, but if you'd like, we can release them with an expedited shipping fee of only $19.99."

There is a difference between trading platforms, web wallets, and personal wallets. If you keep coins on a trading platform or web wallet then they are at greater risk. For one, someone else has access. Secondly, they are at a higher risk for hacking attempts. If you're not trying to sell or trade, immediately transfer to a personal wallet. There are many good options from hardware wallets to smart phone wallets. The important thing to remember is you have full personal responsibility for your keys. If you lose them, you'll not be able to recover the Coins, there won't be a third party that will help you.

If you think it’s going up more, buy back in and mark how much of your BTC balance you lost. Sell again when you can think the price will drop some, buy back in and repeat until you recoup the loss. 
If you find that you’re mis-timing and losing more, then you need to do it another way...
congratulations you’re now a hodler, not a trader... 
Do this: Wait until the dips, make a fiat purchase, wait until the dips, make another. Keep track of how much fiat you invested. Eventually you’ll regain your original loss by the value of btc surpassing the dip points you’ve purchased at. 
Now if only I can take my own advice. lol
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:10:11
I'm saying that so far no other crypto has gotten close to taking the spotlight from bitcoin, unless one does, then it will be bitcoin that becomes the first household name and universally accepted. At the same time, if your goal is to substantially gain by being one of the pioneers, then you should keep tabs on the latest development.
I don't mean if another crypto rises to Bitcoin's status that bitcoin will suddenly crash to nothing. I mean if sometime in the future bitcoins growth seems to stagnate or decline and that change can be linked to the rise of another, then try to find out why. Similar, if something nee shows up that has promise, consider splitting your investment.
I watched litecoin as a likely threat because of the faster transaction times and the ability to still mine with aGPU during the rise of asics. Over time the chances of it becoming more popular than btc without any other fundamental difference seemed unlikely. I still actively buy and sell LTC for small gains since there are periods of high volatility, but I consider it a short term trading coin and not a long term storage of value that may one day be life changing.
Instead of LTC I'm watching etherium for many many reasons, one being what seems to be a very active community of developers.
I also check into others from time to time. Things like NXT, Monroe, and Zcash. I look for any buzz about anything new coming then read up on it. I'm hoping to see a flash of brilliance that solves a problem or does things in a totally new way.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:20:04
Not at all. Many believe, myself included, that crypto currency and blockchain technology will change the world. These are the very early days. 
The advice I give friends and family is buy an amount  that won't put a stain on your finances. Buy at any current market level  and maybe set up small recurring buys. Transfer it to a secure wallet. Don't fret over the price, even if it drops 50-60-70 percent. Just Wait. 
"Wait for what?" Some might ask. "When should I sell?"
$5,000? $10,000, $100,000?
The point is when this begins to change the word on any noticeable scale you won't have to sell.
One thing to keep in mind though is it might not be bitcoin that reaches world wide adoption. If you're ready to enter the realm, keep an eye on other blockchains and how they are innovating. It's possible something revolutionary may show up and very quickly grow to surpass bitcoin. 
Cheers and welcome.

Yes but even if it’s raising... let’s say something is at 100...then 110 then 120... you think “shit I better do a market order. Only then the price jumps to 300 right when you press buy then immediately drops back down to say 105. Well you just bought at this high. You’re screwed. If you look at the chart first and see it rising you can say let me buy at 135. If the price is 110, it will buy it at 110, same if it hit 120. This works just like a market order but supper it did that sudden spike, well now your order doesn’t fill it gets put on the book and when it drops again your order fills when it hits 135. Or by then you might say oh look it’s still dropping so you pull your order before it fills and replace it again for 105 and it fills at that price. 
People do get burned with market buys and sells. Just be careful you aren’t jumping in front of a knife

It is meant to be a deflationary currency. Much like there is only so much gold in the world. The less there is, and the less that’s mined, the more it will be worth.
Opposed to that is Fait currency like the USD. It always loses value because the federal reserve can and does print billions and billions more practically whenever it wants. This means if you’re tying to save money, it ends up becoming worth less as it loses purchasing power. There’s nothing you can do about it. The game is rigged so normal people won’t ever be able to save without the hidden tax of inflation eating away at it. The rich don’t have this problem because they don’t try to save money. They put it in stocks and artwork and such, things that typically always gain value.
Now with Bitcoin and other open deflationary currencies, anyone can own it and save it and profit from its raising value as the supply drops.

You pay more in fees usually and you don’t know the exact price you’re going to get. Market buy is is if you want to get in ASAP. Use a limit buy to put your order in the book advertising how much you want and how much you’ll pay. Typically you’ll get more for the same amount of fiat

So you know how to calculate percentages? Figure out what percent gain from your target buy price to 17 or 18k. Then multiply your investment amount by 1.xx where the xx is the percent gained for the sales price. That will tell you how much you’d have.
Example: 
1.	Current price $13,500
2.	Buy $1000 worth
2.	Target sell price of $18,000
3.	Calculate difference in price. ($18,000 - $13,500 = $4500 increase)
4.	Calculate what percentage different. ($13,500 / $4500 = 0.33333)
5.	Times your purchase amount by that percentage ($1,000 X 0.33333 = $333.33)
6.	Add that to the purchase price. ($1,000 + 3333.33 = $1,333.33)
And that’s how much you’d get if you sold at target price.

You have to calculate percentages. If you buy $100 at a price if 10,000 and then the price goes down to 9000 - it has gone down 10% - that means you subtract 10% from your original 100 which means if you sold you would receive $90. 
On the other hand if it goes up to 11000, then it works the same way, it’s gone up 10% meaning your investment is work 10% more. if you sold, then you would get $110

That's easy. You just need to come up with some other personal incentive for many to mine and to remain an honest actor.
Only I was kidding about the easy part.
As for the future. That depends.
One camp believes the original goal would be to scale up the amount of transactions per block so that thousands and thousands of transactions are included. Some want it to be unlimited or limited only to what is possible to transmit without issues. However, there is a problem if the blocksize didn't have some kind of cap to get users to compete to have a transaction verified. They do this by paying a slightly higher fee. One solution there would be to have a dynamic minimum transaction fee...maybe, I don't know.
The other camp wishes to keep the blocksize locked to a much lower cap than what could potentially be supported and use secondary layers for most transactions. In the situation the fees for the bitcoin transaction will be a lot higher. The belief is it would be more profitable and safer to use bitcoin as a settlement layer. But some think it's a way of allowing these secondary layer processors to hijack the miner income.

Care to define for the community "Good Evidence" and "Safe" ?
Here's a fun way of interpreting your reply...
"The way things are at any given time will always be better for me than when a hard fork proposal comes along and I don't agree with the technical changes or the result of the fork may counter personal incentive. This is fact  for every change, but instead of discussing the merits, risks, pros and cons, I have the ability to slap the "political" label on a hard fork proposal. Once labeled separately from those other hard forks I may like for one reason or another, I can use that label as the main reason why a proposal should be rejected. It's political! Yes, this might help foster support from others to reject it and to do my part in preventing a discussion of the facts. However, I realize there might come a time when a proposal comes along that I *do* support and I understand that others may use this same tired ass tactic and slap on the political label as well, so then I have to point out a secondary criteria for my rejection, one very vague reason that anyone wouldn't disagree with... shhh, yeah I know it's another tired ass tactic, I'm thinking... hmmm well, we all want any changes to go smoothly and instead of discussing the potential risks and mitigations like I might do for those "non-political" hard fork proposals, I need to use a word or phrase that draws on fear and doesn't have a metric to gauge. Ah ha! "Safety!" Yes, now things are always better than a "Political" and "Un-Safe" hard fork. Am I missing any thing? Oh right, one more thing. Got to think about the people who created the proposal, and the people who support the proposal, and the people who would just like to learn a little more about it from the community. Some of them might actually try to support the position and show they think it will be "safe". They fallen into the trap, good, but they might try to use *gasp* facts. Uh uh. Got to shut that down quick. Let's dig into the old bag of bullshit.... fuck, let's just say anything they present isn't worth the time for anyone unfamiliar with the situation to research further, that you've done the work, and while yes, the people discussing the topic might have evidence, you have determined it all to be "Not Good" and you're doing us all a favor by telling the community. Oh crap, I can't say all this... what would people think? Let's shorten it all up. *Ahem* Hey, you, guy with the idea.... 'Status quo is preferable over a HF motivated for political reasons without any good evidence it is safe' *Blow raspberries.*"

Good morning. In less than three months, full nodes from here will join others from around the world. And you will be launching the largest blockchain battle in this history of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin -- that word should have new meaning for all of us today...
We can't be consumed by our petty block size differences anymore. We will be united in our common interests. Perhaps its fate that that day is the 1st of August, and you will be UASFing for our freedom, not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution -- but from miner centralization.
We're UASFing for our right to scale, to active SegWit. And should we win that day, the 1st of August will no longer be known as NATIONAL GIRLFRIENDS DAY (seriously?), but as the day when the economic majority declared in one voice:
"We will not move to alt-coins quietly in the night!
We will not allow covert ASIC Boost without a fight!
We're going to HODL on!
We're going to softfork!"
August 1st, we celebrate our UASF Day!

Rise or fall, just buy what you can and keep up on the average... and I should have seen your username first lol

Man I wish I understood these charts lol
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:11:24
I'd say about Tree-Fiddy
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:27:43
I thought swills wouldn't send payments unless verified on gox

THANKS FUTURE SELF! I'M ON IT!
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:20:36
Sorry about your woes, but for starters you should read the goddamn rules. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:06:13
live and learn. Buy back in as soon as you can. Sorry about your pop. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:56:32
Holy shit, I just shattered my legs and broke my neck. Worth it. Thank you!

A retailer? Ha. We need to make this the official currency of the internet.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:44:13
But deflationary currencies discourage spending!
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:30:43
shit. I knew that not.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:25:47
I don't know what you are talking about, comrade. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:28:30
A distributed marketplace would be nice. Mtgox is great but it's a single point of failure. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:47:22
What the fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:23:12
Why not let the users set their own?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:43:17
dude feel free to transfer your BTC to me if you're checking out permanently. :-D
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:12:18
Nice to meet you, Mr. Noonerver.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:40:18
Wow. As someone looking to learn how to do what you do, where would you send them?
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:02:44
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:09:48
I didn't make any claim. I just like to cuss and pretend like I know what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:15:54
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:11:23
"...I wait till it's at the bottom and buy as many BTC as I can..."
Dude, I would love to know the answer to this. Please share. :-D
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:01:23
I don't think anyone knows how to use it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:51:26
Yes in the US. We need to be verified to send money. I missed the boat when they were 20 a coin. Now there's 8000+ people ahead of me. It's all good though, I believe that this will break through to main steam. When it does fractions of 1 BC will trade for $100 usd. I don't care how long it takes. I plan to pump a set amount of dollars into it each pay period.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:38:22
I personally am watching the Bitcoin ATMs closely. I think that's the best investment op coming up anytime soon. Not only will it earn a profit but it will bring in more people.
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:03:41
Yeah? How's that working out for ya?
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:51:11
I got that part. What are the vertical bars?
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:06:38
how many bit coins?
@_date: 2013-03-29 03:50:10
/Slow clap.
Hell yeah.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:57:22
Not sure he knew I was joking or not sure if he was joking about my joking. hmmm ;-D
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:22:49
seriously fuck these guys
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:57:02
Buy low and sell high. Penis.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:37:37
How long are you thinking of holding? 
Long term:
Buy (X) at current. If it drops buy more. If price drops more, buy more. Keep track of average.
Short term:
Sell what you have when you think it's topped out. Wait and hope for a comfortable drop to where you can increase position.
@_date: 2013-11-26 18:29:43
Isn't the point of local so you can, you know, do it locally and in person?
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:47:24
Yep and I'm one of them lol
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:20:20
Wow. That does seem dangerous. Is there a site which matches up people to do this? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:48:55
Why should I trust your site?
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:31:34
Believe in the system and you can't go wrong. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:12:10
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:38
I want it to continue so I can get a better entry point.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:07:58
I guess it is a bit risky to sell. I suppose it flips the other way. Maybe there are sellers looking for reputable buyers? Doubtful I know. I just don't feel like jumping through the hoops and based on my research it seems Dwolla might be the best option for U.S. citizens. Maybe there's a way to send from paypal to there? Or if there's a better option I'd like to check it out.
