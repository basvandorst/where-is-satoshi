What?!? That's all he does are you insane? I'm not going to spend the time googling this because it's so easy to figure out but holy shit that's an ignorant statement.

I'm most likely older than you kid, and I'm more than likely more aware than you are regarding our shortcomings as a nation. We're still talking about the guy that just "annexed" the crimean peninsula yeah? Take your edgelord shit and annoy someone that gives a fuck instead please.
@_date: 2019-07-05 23:55:29
You're a fucking moron.
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:17:17
They didn't get that far into the lie yet to answer your questions I guess.
@_date: 2019-07-06 18:14:04
Ok con artist whatever you say. You have a day old account, responded almost instantly to my post when it wasn't even in your inbox and said elsewhere that you'd gladly accept help if anyone wanted to give it. Just because you didn't just come out and say it doesn't mean shit. You posted here hoping that someone would give you Bitcoin so go fuck yourself you snake. Where's any proof that what you say is true? Oh wait there isn't and never will be... ��
@_date: 2019-07-05 06:29:09
Ah that makes more sense now that you explain it. Congrats though we've managed to summon a misanthrope and their 4 alt accounts it seems
@_date: 2019-07-07 08:22:13
Yup. Total bullshit for sure
@_date: 2019-07-04 17:01:39
He's not cool at all. He also isn't saying shit pertaining to crypto here. He's trying to undermine the US dollar worldwide to weaken our geopolitical influence. Putin is a butcher you shouldn't be glorifying his ass.
@_date: 2019-07-06 17:52:30
Because he's hoping that someone will feel bad for him enough to send him Bitcoin. The accounts a day old and I see this crap all the time here. Reddit 8s the perfect place to do this shit because the majority of the people here are indoor children with no street smarts and it only takes one sucker.

Directly to your right on the sidebar is a link to bitcoin beginners. I think that you'll find much more patient voices there. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:52:25
well obviously, but at the cost of the environment and the workers etc.  Like that's the whole reason that unfettered capitalism has to be regulated. Obviously the milk will get there quick and the price will balance but on the other hand it becomes a lord of the flies situation very quickly. I'm not saying that your concept is wrong just that it doesn't work in reality which is why these things exist in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:36:13
Alright you clown, your source is a website that was made to elicit donations? mkay. This whole point of comparing the rest of the world to the discussion is ridiculous. You still haven't answered my question and I'm not going to respond until you do. Explain to me how someone waiting tables in North Dakota can have a job waiting tablee when they live 25 miles from town without a car? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:54:53
wtf are you prattling on about now? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:08:26
I randomly logged in, saw it around 16k and bought more 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:02:04
What bubble are you living in? A car totally isn't necessary when you're waiting tables in a city with good weather perhaps. Talk to poor people in rural areas who wait tables about how  they might pull up those bootstraps and walk 25 miles to their job in the winter. As someone who has been desperately poor before your attitude is laughable and ignorant. 
@_date: 2019-07-07 08:23:23
That's the opposite of what you posted earlier you stupid piece of garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:56:45
You were the one who said asinine things about bootstrapping in the first place. Also while I respect you going on your little mission trip once or twice (talk about fucking "American privilege" in a nutshell) I promise that I've seen much more of the world than you kiddo. Actually I'm impressed that you actually did see some of the world and still have your head so far up your own ass. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:35:01
Yeah totally letting capitalists run free always works /s. There's a reason that we have to have anti gouging laws in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:12:04
I saw your deleted comment there good will hunting. Nice job. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:22:45
C'mon engineer you're smarter than that hopefully. Comparing international wealth (without sources obviously) to the working poor in America is disingenuous and you did it to gloss over the fact that your logic is flawed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:08:56
Again, I never once said that anyone couldn't $10 a month. Not one single time. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:59:04
Oh wow brutal response bro get back to your desk before your boss yells at you. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:47:56
That's a really great way to think. I'm going to borrow that my friend. 
@_date: 2019-11-05 05:11:18
90% of this sub has no idea how important bitcoin is, they just see a get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:58:48
People love their fucking perks and points but they truly don't understand that those perks come directly out of the pockets of small business's. I'm not sure why they don't understand that but then again people are extremely fucking stupid.
@_date: 2018-03-14 08:17:21
It's actually way, way worse
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:37:44
Well you can't even master two/too/to so that basically proves that women can't drive /s. Jackass. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:42:03
You're completely incorrect. First of all it's the "pappy van Winkle" brand that goes for the big bucks and second it is aged in the barrel for 15-23 years before they sell it so there is no way we will see an uptick in supply for the better part of a decade or two. Not to mention that they still haven't been producing much to preserve the demand. That's what their rip and Buffalo trace brands are for.
