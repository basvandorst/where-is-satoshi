Send a tip for the Bitcoin Song: 
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:33:59
"Welcome To The Blockchain" has been the anthem for a long time now...
@_date: 2015-12-27 05:01:01
we're now standing on the precipice of a global revolution   
of politics, economics, and government   
welcome to the blockchain   
verse 1: 
power corrupts and money is power  
 the power to control the money is one that is now   
in the hands of those who pretend we can't function without them   
so how can we do something about it? (huh?)   
working hard to get a raise, lifting that wage up   
inflation takes it like a hidden taxation   
manipulated interest rates to give the banks   
a way to create money with the loans that they're giving out daily   
that means our money is debt   
gotta pay it back more than a hundred percent   
it's no wonder then why the middle class is going under   
when the one's above them gotta cover and come to collect   
and many have no access to banking,   
making payments, or saving, so more fees are taken   
and everyday the gatekeepers are trying to stop change   
we can not wait, welcome to the block chain   
chorus: 
welcome to the blockchain   
things are about to change   
open up the gates   
systems get replaced   
bitcoin   
decentralize the trust   
security, transparency   
the network's run by us   
bitcoin   
verse 2: 
bitcoin is a decentralized ledger   
and the currency is its first enterprise ever   
secured by the worldwide incentivized network   
can't be stolen or controlled by any sized effort   
you can send it anywhere and instantly   
no one can intervene, no third party in between   
there's no counterfeiting   
algorithms control the outer limits of how many coins can get released   
programmable money, no government can seize it   
payments can be customized by sender and receiver   
contracts can be written cementing your agreements   
with terms that can't be bent once you consent then it completes it   
autonomous businesses are possible   
where profit is distributed among those adopting it     
paradigm shift we must adjust to the ending     
with the blockchain, bitcoin is just the beginning     
chorus: 
welcome to the blockchain   
things are about to change   
open up the gates   
systems get replaced   
bitcoin   
decentralize the trust   
security, transparency   
the network's run by us   
bitcoin   
bridge: 
now that we got control   
we're not gonna let it go   
my people all around the globe   
we gotta keep building, building, building   
now that we got control   
we're not gonna let it go   
my people all around the globe   
we gotta keep building, building, building   
chorus: 
chorus: 
welcome to the blockchain   
things are about to change   
open up the gates

security, transparency

Welcome To The Blockchain is really the only Bitcoin song that matters :)
@_date: 2015-12-27 04:15:22
thank you! and thank you for the tip!
@_date: 2015-12-27 00:13:55
Care to explain what you mean in regards to this song?

@_date: 2014-12-15 10:05:16
yessir...it's all original
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:39:02
you're right.. hope this helps! 
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:05:46
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:02:09
haha..how much is 1 standing ovation worth? ;)
@_date: 2014-11-17 09:49:30
I hear you, but the goal of the song was to be informative for newcomers while energizing the existing community as an "anthem" so to speak.  In order to do that, I felt it needed to walk that line...Thanks for listening and glad you enjoyed it!
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:28:12
was there any money lost in the exchange rate given by the woman you traded with in Thailand?
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:23:01
thanks! it didn't work but thanks anyways :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:28:27
well we did post all the information directly underneath....what doesn't need to type it in..they can copy and paste...as many have done...thanks though!
@_date: 2014-11-18 05:05:42
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:57:47
You also have to check to see if they have any BTC in their hot wallet before you try to send to Ripple...your transaction probably canceled.  Try it again...
@_date: 2014-11-17 09:16:05
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:32:47
thanks! feel free to spread the song around as much as you'd like :)

 Welcome To The Blockchain...a much better Bitcoin song
@_date: 2016-03-25 08:12:30
"Welcome To The Blockchain" is the only hip hop song you need about Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:40:58
thank you!
@_date: 2016-03-26 08:05:58
Welcome To The Blockchain is still the best song about Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-03-28 05:42:09
You should do one for "Welcome To The Blockchain" 
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:41:08
yessir..keep spreading it!
@_date: 2016-03-08 05:44:26

Hi, 34,000 people have watched this video and realized that I do not mean that some Bitcoin authority has designated it the official song of Bitcoin.  It's simply to designate it's intended purpose which is to be an anthem for the movement and the community.  
@_date: 2016-03-26 08:06:27
Welcome To The Blockchain is still the best song about Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:48:46
I'll have to check that out...thanks for the tip :)
@_date: 2016-03-26 08:06:19


@_date: 2016-01-18 22:41:15
Much appreciated!
@_date: 2016-03-09 00:29:55
Professionalism? You just called my actions purposely misleading and malicious for being one of the 6 other songs listed as "official bitcoin song" on youtube.....You're exceptionally hostile, extremely paranoid, and making an enormous issue out of a complete non-issue.  You're either trolling or you're being an asshole.  
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:40:52
@_date: 2019-03-14 22:19:59
really? that's weird...it's just a redirect to a Bandcamp page....thanks for being a rebel!
@_date: 2019-03-10 07:20:53
you are very wise! :)
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:41:54
hopefully...I think there's a lot of potential to redesign the transaction model for music. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:34:05
Are you just trolling? If someone was not allowing you to have thousands of dollars worth of your own money and won't return your messages...you wouldn't at least be annoyed? I just posted here to warn people of the incompetence or nefariousness going on over there....stop being a jerk for no reason.
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:59:50
If I recall I presented two possibilities....
A. They are incompetent and are having technical problems and are failing to provide support for those technical problems
or 
B. They are short on funds and are trying to cover up
It HAS to be one of those two...so I'm not sure where the rush to judgment is....maybe you rushed to insult without reading my post?
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:54:22
If you recall what Gox was doing up until their implosion was delaying withdrawals and having "technical issues" that prevented people from getting their money....so this falls right in line with what Poloniex is doing now...
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:56:49
Postponing withdrawals implies intent...If their transactions are failing...(like I stated in my OP)..it means they're just incredibly incompetent which is also a good reason to not keep funds there
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:39:15
If they're postponing withdrawals for ANY reason that means they're trying to cover up for lack of funds....
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:53:05
Will do definitely going forward....just trying to warn others about the situation..
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:40:56
24 hour lag huh? Even though my identical transaction on Shapeshift sent me my coins in about 10 seconds
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:42:40
exactly....there should be no delays on withdrawals for ANY reason
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:09:56
So failing to complete withdrawals for more than 24 hours (which apparently has happened to several people) is not a sign that something is going on with Poloniex?
@_date: 2019-03-13 23:50:22
yes...my old stuff (about 5 years old) is here [ . New album coming in 2019 called Free Machine.  
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:51:06
Maybe it has to do with amounts? I've been waiting over 24 hours...on 3 separate withdrawals made hours apart
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:44:39
weird...i'm using google chrome and it comes up with no problems
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:32:14
Butthurtness? I've been waiting to have access to thousands of dollars worth of coins for almost 2 days with no response from support.  I'm posting on here to warn others that there is either some incompetence or nefariousness going on.  Why the condescension? 
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:55:39
I used Gox for years without any issues also...
Over 24 hour delay with no response from customer support is not "bit of lag"...it is either complete incompetence or nefariousness. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:20:36
If it's a lag, then it's an issue with Poloniex's system...not with blocks being full....in which case the problem is incompetency which I presented as one of the options above. 
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:50:19
Gox was the most trusted exchange until it wasn't...same goes for Cryptsy, Mintpal, etc...
If they are not sending out withdrawals for an entire day they're either completely incompetent or they're short on funds....
Thanks for the name calling though..
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:10:44
Now you've got that image in my head...thanks for that.. lol
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:55:56
very bizarre
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:16:14
This is very possible
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:56:11
They have not done any proof of reserves to my knowledge...you are correct about BTS...
I barely avoided being burned by Cryptsy and Mintpal...
I don't know if it's widespread..but I know of a few other people who have had problems....but apparently a few others have had no problems at all...so who knows..
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:12:58
Why did this get tagged as spam? WTF?
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:39:06
fair enough...no worries....thank you!
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:14:59
This is genius!!...what sort of timeline are we looking at for release?
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:57:10
What does that even mean? An exchange fails to allow its users to withdraw for over 24 hours without any response from support and suggesting that they are either incompetent or nefarious is "crap"?
@_date: 2016-06-12 04:49:22
So you're going with the "they're completely incompetent" explanation?
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:26:36
Hey...thanks for the consideration....who is the artist? who is producing? how is it being released? etc...My schedule is crazy these days so I have to see if it's something I can make work..
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:48:38
Except that I've edited three comments in this thread and there are no asterisks on any of them.  
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:30:30
1. I don't have any orders outstanding 2. There is no wallet problem on my end. 
I withdrew my coins in 3 separate withdrawals, I confirmed the withdrawals via email...and 40 hours later it still says "Awaiting Approval"....and zero response from support....
The problem is either 1. Some error in Poloniex's system and thus incompetence or 2. Some nefarious action
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:34:17
Also a lie...you do realize that editing your posts after you've been called out for a lying doesn't change reality right?
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:29:29
You mean you made a factually incorrect statement which I called you out on....so you deleted it to shift the goalposts.  You can stop trolling now...it's "official"...you've ruined the thread.
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:11:49
cool story bro
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:07:23
You know for a fact that you edited the post after I replied....I don't know why I'm actually debating this with you....you know what you did...and I keep falling into your troll trap each time you throw out more garbage..
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:42:09
There are no asterisks for edits unless you yourself put them in....why do you insist on trolling? and blatantly lying?
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:28:39
You deleted your previous comment....so clearly you knew what you were saying was wrong.
Also it's not the "first line in the video"...it's the first line in the description of the video which facetiously states that...and absolutely NO ONE out of the 51 k people who have listened to it except for you is even remotely confused by that yet you continue to troll. If you like the song...great...if you don't...that's fine as well...but this stuff...is just pure idiocy.

Any system that does not get strengthened by greed will eventually be corrupted or will collapse in the long run anyways.  The way I see it, this greed strengthens the ability of Bitcoin's more revolutionary characteristics to change the world.

I lost about 50 BTC on there being stupid..and yes there were some VERY bizarre things going on with the blackjack....if you raised your bet after losing you lost 9 out of 10 times.  At one point I lost 43...yes FORTY THREE hands in a row.  Either I have the worst luck in the world or there's something very bizarre going on with their "provably fair" mechanism.

@_date: 2013-06-25 19:58:00
I sent them a message about it a few months ago and never got a response
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:28:36
It is in their best interests to carefully manage the distribution of XRP so as not to devalue it.  Especially if Ripple is successful, the current value of XRP would be pennies of what it would potentially be in a flourishing Ripple marketplace.  Why sell themselves short if they foresee their business being successful?
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:39:14
It appears they have temporarily halted it but will probably resume again soon

Just to again add to this conversation...I played a lot last year on bitzino...and I repeatedly witness the stalling and complained about it to the site owner...who insisted it was something wrong with my connection....on top of that I once lost 43...yes FORTY THREE hands in a row....while that is statistically possible it is incredibly improbable...and if you understand the statistical probability of turning certain cards in blackjack it is quite absurd how after several thousand hands the percentages could be so skewed.  I foolishly wasted 50 + BTC figuring out just how flawed their system is.
