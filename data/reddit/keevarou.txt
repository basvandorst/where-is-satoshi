I just maxed out what I can of loans and invested like 12000 in bitcoins 
If I can't pay the loan, they will write it off once in my life
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:43:03
No risk 
And the write off is just a forgiving of a loan from the government to write off debt 
And 2btc is not much in the grand scheme of things for most people

Thank you so much for such a lengthy and filling answer 
Coin corner looks like a decent place to buy my future bitcoins from now on!
I'm live in Europe 
The yes there is a decent amount of FOMO
I do not really try to do leverage and trading, just holding considering I know that I tend to mess up in the heat of the moment 
I looked for cashapp 
Sadly its not available in my country 
I reached my goal of "2BTC" so my future buys will be much slower and calmer, so I will either use coin corner or the local bitcoin site, theres only like 1 site in this country to buy bitcoins 
(Bank transfers taking 5-7 days) was a bit much to me for the initial buys,  for now I only have to put my faith on Skrill when the price goes up to 20k each again so I can cash out and move to bitcoins I can withdraw 
Considering I have ethereum wallet with the 2FA codes which is needed for transfer (saved on a memory stick and zipped the wallet with a strong password) to minimize the future risks

And yes its not a tax write off 
It's a lending write off which the government takes process off 
But its not called bankruptcy
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:16:33
That's why I have as an extra precaution to only plug in the wallet when I need it 
And I'm not sure If the encryption is strong enough, I just know its AES-256 since I use 7zip
So I add as many layers as possible of security 
Even though I know that the most secure is most likely hardware wallets like trezor and such
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:02:24
The loan writeoff is a one time thing only 
And its through the government
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:03:35
I would rather not disclose the country I live in 
But we got a system for people who get into debt and can't pay it off 
It's a one time thing, so the government would take the bill
In a legal sense its not bankruptcy
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:37:25
Oh I am conservative all right about my decisions 
Which is why I took up a loan, since theres no drawbacks 
If it fails I can always get the loan written off once and I dont have to repay it 
Skrill/paysafe is pretty well known here since you can buy skrill cards everywhere and paysafe is pretty well established 
Only negative is not owning a real bitcoin yes 
But for tax reasons it is considered a real bitcoin 
Better than to miss out is what my strategy was to be fair
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:58:12
I don't know why you say that
But ok
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:46:56
Well it is failsafe 
And not really defrauding the government either since its 100% legal and a right to do that
And saving and buying is less time efficient
Better to buy up a small stock and then buy up later again if bitcoin falls back again, double dipping
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:56:07
Nope 
My mother got a 70 000 dollars loan written off a few years ago 
She recently took up another 70 000 dollars loan
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:42:38
You didnt miss anything 
It's just a failsafe after all 
So no risk for me an all potential profits with bitcoin adventure
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:29:04
Didnt mean to flex, considering it's a small amount
But my primary concern is their legitimacy as crypto exchange, and how secure it is purely for hold, since that's the only goal for me 
1.5% seems reasonable since the other exchange I found is 1% I think and 5 days money insertion time +1% or 1.5% deposit fee
And 0.01% fee a month 
My usage for now is to just hold until price skyrockets, so most likely 1+ years
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:54:44
Thats the only part I'm afraid of tbh
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:36:16
That's my plan later on when bitcoins become like 20k each again 
It's only half laundering since I took up a 10 000 loan to buy it, so I got my plans with it 
And I need to check the fees for the local bitcoin site in my country, I just remember it being very expensive to transfer to and from there 
I just justified the "premium" over the possibility of bitcoin rising 10-20% with me missing it because bank takes 5-7 days to transfer
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:30:52
2.5% total fee to buy bitcoin/bitcoin equivalent seems reasonable to me and not a hefty premium 
 But thanks for the clarification
@_date: 2019-05-04 16:00:42
Thank you 
I will for sure look into that !
@_date: 2019-05-04 10:38:28
Those are very true points 
And I have been through it once.. *cough cough* wex *cough cough*
Hopefully skrill/paysafe won't do that 
But for now 
The eternal holding
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:51:52
I dont think its called bankruptcy
Its just that the loan/debt disappears 
That's all that happens 
So the liability just disappears
@_date: 2019-05-04 14:00:44
Its technically not bankruptcy 
It's a different thing 
So theres literally nothing to lose for me
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:54:20
Maybe not a tax write off 
But the government just pays your debt 
That's all there is to it 
I have seen it several times
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:40:01
Well, you are entitled to feel what you feel 
There are many different examples for this community 
Both good and bad, and even if you get your wish fulfilled, nothing would really happen anyway
But we both got the ability to post and voice our opinions, that's the wonders of internet 
So have a nice day bud
@_date: 2019-05-04 11:54:54
Why learn when I can use stupidity to take advantage of a system?
I do hope it works out too 
Most likely much safer than a Russian bitcoin exchange since everyone and their dog knows about paysafe
