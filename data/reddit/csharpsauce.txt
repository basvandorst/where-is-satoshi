Back when Silkroad was around, and people would ask me (because I was ALWAYS talking about it) why bitcoin had any value.
I'd say, well you know how like most oil producers require US dollars to buy oil?  Well one could say dollars are always redeemable for oil, which gives them value.
Along the same lines, you know how silk road requires bitcoin? Well would could say bitcoins are always redeemable in pot, which gives them value.

Remember though, the advantage bitcoin has is that it was the first.  Today it is struggling to keep up with transaction volumes and the community seems to have voted they don't want fix it.  Meanwhile Ether is outperforming, and is being used for practical purposes (while companies are dropping bitcoin).  If you're justifying your investment because the technology has potential, then I hope you're keeping an eye out because there's better technology out there.  It's an unpopular opinion here... but those are  the facts.

It will definitely stop for a moment at 11k on its way down.  $1k is my target price.  There's no reason why bitcoin should be valued more than Ether.  Ether is having no problems handling its transaction volume (outperforming bitcoin), it's being used for many practical purposes, and it has a more efficient mining algorithm.  I think Bitcoin will stick around, it's the first, it has momentum... but I don't think it's the future.

I'm going to get downvoted for this, because its somewhat negative, but imaginary internet points don't matter to me haha.
I got in at $8 via mtgox, and sold at about $1040 via bitstamp... I remember being floored when it went from $.10 to a $1.  basically... i'm just saying, I've been on the roller coaster a while.
I fundamentally believe that bitcoin has developed some revolutionary technology, and is setting some really important foundations for internet commerce.  I also believe something like bitcoin had to be developed before a better version could be accepted.   As an engineer, when I work with a new technology the first thing I do is create a simplified proof of concept, and then I let people play with it.  In the process problems are revealed, and missing features are discovered.  I view bitcoin as the proof of concept for digital currencies, and to that I think its been pretty successful.
But as a proof of concept, it also has shown some flaws.  Bitcoin is unstable, these wild price fluctuations that you and I have watched these past few years are fundamental to the currency.  More people adopting the currency won't make it better... probably only worse to be honest.  Actually, its not even a guess, we have a thing called econometrics, and we can predict it pretty reasonably.  Its been said a whole bunch of times, but I believe it to be true... bitcoin is a commodity for speculators to trade.  It has value because people want it, and can use it, but the amount of people who want bitcoins instead of dollars is still astronomically low relative to the amount of people who participate in our economy.  Now on one hand this means that there's still a bunch of room for bitcoin to grow... and hell, i'd bet it probably will.  But at the same time I think the growth rate will be smaller then in the past few years (my original point).
In business there's this concept of TAM (total addressable market) which refers to the total opportunity size that could theoretically be served.  Now in theory bitcoin has the TAM of the entire worlds economy.  If that is true, the TAM would be so fucking huge that a single bitcoin would be worth maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions.  Hell the US real estate market alone is worth 25 trillion dollars, bitcoin should be worth over a million dollars a coin by that measure (well not really... the math isn't that simple).  But the idea is there will only ever be 21 million coins, but actually a lot less because thousands of them have been lost, and the economy is mother fucking huge.  But my theory is that the TAM for bitcoin is NOT the equivalent of the worlds economy, but instead the equivalent of the total combined wallets of the worlds libertarians/computer science geeks/those who don't understand economics.  Which is maybe $100 billion.  Of course the price will fluctuate depending on the velocity that coins circulate the economy, which is ungodly slow, in addition to any other scheme someone is attempting.  It is the wild west out there.
Though none of the current altocurrencies have shown to be good alternatives, I have full faith that soon (maybe in the next 4 years?) a currency that makes economists/normal people more confident about it will come out.  When that happens, I think that currency really will be to the moon successful (though hopefully not in price haha).

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:22:32
This is how crashes work though.  Some big fish will profit take at $25k causing the correction.  The guy who got in at 21k will see a big loss, realize his doubt was for real, and get out to save his principal.  The guy who got in at 20k will see the writing on the wall, which will trigger the guy who got in at $15k... and so on.  The new money will stop showing up, so people will have to sell for less and less as they get nervous.  How many of the people who bought in recently got in for quick cash, and how many got in to make a long-term investment?  The market will correct itself.  And it won't be a small correction.  The market went up too much too quickly.   I'm betting on the correction bottoming out at $1k maybe $500.  I've been on the coaster for a long time.  I saw it happen when it first reached $30, I saw it happen again at $100, and again at $1k.  Same comments always, (much better memes this time though).  Bitcoin always goes up, but it doesn't go up at 2000x a year over the long run.

What was the real cause of the great depression, if a deflationary currency was not part of it?
Bitcoin only reinforces his point.  When you see these speculative bubbles, people are valuing the currency more than the things it can be traded for.  That causes the velocity of the economy to slow down.  It's a really bad thing for an economy as a whole.

One of my main interests in bitcoin is that it offers a way of doing business on the internet without having to go through a private entity.  Its the tendency of the internet to drive down prices to the absolute minimum... and frankly, in some cases I've had to can ideas because of the credit card fees.
I would be satisfied if governments would start creating virtual cash... and I would be even more satisfied if it was controlled by something higher than a countries government so I wouldn't have to arbitrary convert currencies.  Its somewhat paradoxical in my mind that we've managed to build layer upon layer of abstraction building an economy that is greater than the borders of our countries, but we still end up paying exchange fees.
The only unfortunate consequence, is I then have to trust a group of individuals to have "my" best interest in mind.  If the recent scandal with Strauss-Khan demonstrates anything, its that even the most trusted individuals are not perfect.  This I feel makes bitcoins decentralized nature an asset (as opposed to a weakness) Unfortunately though, that does not make his point about the issues related to decentralization any less true.
My take is that, bitcoin is not the answer to the problems that I think the world has.  But I'm really glad we're talking about it, and I think it had at least something to do with it.

Things have to be done in baby steps.  The world of tomorrow can't be had tomorrow.  I kind of expect bitcoin (and something like I'm proposing) to fail in the long term in their own right, for reasons I probably can't predict.  However I think the success they've had will the be beginnings of something larger!  I'm hoping today to start talking about what the steps are.   That is why i'm proposing this experiment.  I want to start building a foundation, and see where people take it.

The goal of my idea is to create a customizable system of government, so each person on this planet can get the freedoms they desire, and the quality of life they desire free from corruption, and exploitation by virtue of the architecture.
As a software engineer I have drawn my inspiration from that of Object Oriented Programming.  All policy is managed online via open source transparent software, and voted in by people registered to a global layer.  Policy is managed in an organizational unit.  These organizational units carry with them access to a pool of tax resources (which might be bitcoins). Entrance to an org unit is determined by the org unit, however no org unit can implement measures to prevent exiting.   Additionally org units can inherit policy (and tax resources) from other org units.  Each policy will define its own access privileges which govern how inheritance is handled.  A policy may be private (only applicable to voters who are direct members of an org unit) protected (applicable to voters who are members of org unit A, or any voter whom are members of org unit B that may be inheriting org unit A, but not applicable to say org unit c which is completely unconnected) finally a policy can be made public (unrelated org units can subscribe to a single shared policy, which may include tax resources).  Additionally policy can be overridden by any inheriting hive if it is marked virtual.  With this structure I’m hoping that as org units start faltering due to internal politics, corruption etc a replacement can be created, and people can move with ease.

@_date: 2011-06-06 20:26:38
yep! However it has to be done in layers.   There are policies which are regionally specific, that you just cannot choose to opt out of.  I think the idea is to make sure you have a solid division of layers between organizational units.  On the bottom is a global layer, this layer would have policy that is globally relevant.  Above that layer would be really basic structures that can be defined, and used by local governments (local as in city) perhaps you live in a city that has public garbage service.  Social policies etc would then be opted in/out by the individual regardless of region.
@_date: 2011-05-18 13:40:21
I think its potentially the natural progression of an economy.  The economic principle in the past, is that the economy is a zero-sum game.  If I get a piece of gold from you, you now have less, and I have more.  However the transition from a gold-backed currency to a purely fiat currency I believe demonstrates a transition in economic theory.  No longer is our goal to obtain the greatest share of the worlds wealth.   No longer do dollars represent wealth.  I believe today, they represent value.  There is only so much gold in the world, and oil etc... at any one point in time.  However the value we derive from this wealth is not zero sum, when I buy a gallon of gas, I am purchasing it for the value that it will provide me (not the great investment it likely is... ) for example some gas stations will charge more for full service.  Despite the fact that it is the same gasoline as the self serve station across the street has, it has added value in that of not having to pump it yourself.  In this sense value is quite arbitrary, so it seems reasonable that a currency representing it can be arbitrary.  If there is a flaw with bitcoin, it would instead be its tendency to deflate... In our economy we are always finding ways to do more with what we have.  The sum of value is (and can) always grow... so its important that the currency represents that.

Bitcoin is starting to be used for real (silk road) there definitely is value in it, and that makes it worth investing in.  That said, the volatility of the market is making the products themselves volatile, which to me reduces the value.  Personally the entire situation makes me reminiscent of the many bubbles we have recently witnessed.  The cost is greater than the value, and the growth is unsustainable.  I'd get in after it falls significantly... assuming it survives the fall.

Yeah, he'd have the buying power equivalently less than $4.  It was never in his favor to hold onto those dollars for long periods of time.  This is a good thing, because it provides velocity to the economy.
I believe you need a balance.  Freicoin for example is a great currency if all that mattered is velocity... but it gives up "holding power" which is another desirable trait in a currency, so its not a good idea.  A good currency would find a balance between these traits so as to provide a steady environment to facilitate a smooth economy.
I think that's possible with a different algorithm for mining coins, but thats a different conversation.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:03:22
And this ultimately is the problem with bitcoin in my opinion.  A currency should encourage economic growth, but bitcoin is the opposite.  Holding bitcoin doesn't help anyone, spending it does as it creates economic velocity.
In a good currency price should fluctuate with the changes in supply and demand for the actual product/commodity/services etc. Instead with bitcoin it seems the biggest pull on price fluctuation is the demand for the currency itself... which is not a good thing.

As is typical with any duality, this one is not necessary true.  To much inflation is a bad thing, as is too much deflation.  There's historical evidence for both.  An optimal system is one that is well balanced.   To be perfectly honest I question how balanced bitcoin actually is.
Here's the thing (and i realize this an uphill battle on this subreddit).  There are two extremes to speak of here.  On one side the economy drives the currency, and on the other the currency drives the economy.  I believe ultimately the (false) debate about whether inflation or deflation is adventitious breaks down to how you view the play between the economy and the currency.  As my first sentence of this comment started out, I think any duality is wrong.  You can't have just one side driving the other.  I have some ideas on how to modify bitcoin to satisfy this, but I don't want to side rail my point.

I'm not sure I understand, my understanding is the difficulty algorithm controls the target which controls how easy or difficult it is to find a coin... am I wrong here?


So that information is not really necessary... so lets take the quantity equation MV = PY.  The idea is that in nominal terms that quantity of money times the velocity should be equal to the price of all "stuff" in the economy.  So i'm not trying to make sure 1 orange is always one coin... the price SHOULD fluctuate with actual demand... however the price should not fluctuate simply because the supply of money is incorrect.
Clearly my post was a bit to early... so whatever... i strongly feel like there's a way to algorithmicly change the rate at which new coins are being mined, so that the number of coins in the economy matches the demand.

Yes, i'm aware its dynamically adjusted... its something like max target / current target.  I think you're missing my point...

I remember the days when 3 bitcoins would net you $5.
