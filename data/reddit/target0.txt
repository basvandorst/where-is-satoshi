Great idea. For some this may be very convenient. I use a small one connected to my keys. This could be a nice alternative. I lose them as fast as pens when they aren't connected to something. I like keeping it on my keys because you can't drive your car and leave the stick behind when it's attached to the keys.

Your money is in the right place, except it's still in your coinbase account, which you may want to move at some point. Tulip mania was inflationary, Bitcoin is deflationary.  Big difference.

A licensed derivatives exchange tho.... these are the kind of financial products that will help bitcoin.  These are the established legal products that make merchants feel better about accepting bitcoin.  Baby steps.  I'd rather hear about things like this than another merchant adoption story that's just another off-ramp taking fiat out of the bitcoin system.

so i guess the Don King event coordinator extracted every drop of hype from this one.  From the people who wanted to hear him speak, and those who wanted to bring the pitchforks out when he did.  then at the last minute pulled him.  I bet a Josh Garza dunk tank would be pretty popular there.

Torrenting needs to be stupid easy.  This what is really necessary for the technology to take off.  You still need to know a thing or two about computers to use torrents.  You dont need to know anything to use popcorntime though.  We always talk about apps being built on bitcoin.... popcorntime is a good example of an application built on top of a torrent technology that makes things easy for the average person.  People need to be using bitcoin and not even know it.
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:40:47
i think he did a little more than tell a few white lies.  there was a lot of money involved too.  Liars of this caliber deserve some time in a cell.  If you allow people to run scams like this with little to no jail time, then its going to keep on happening.  You need to crack down on scammers.  If the penalty for the crime still makes the rewards seem worth it..... then people will keep committing them.
I do feel people have some personal accountability in these issues as well.  There are new products and services popping up every day in the cryptocurrency space and many are brand new.  We cant go throwing our coins at everything without doing research or these scams will continue.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:07:33

@_date: 2015-04-30 13:18:06
Thanks for the tip!  I'm sure it takes a ton of cash to move the market around like that.  I'm sure its not whales alone making the market move.  they do have to trade the trend to make money.  I think we're starting to find that the trend is not playing nicely with these whales anymore because the greed is getting too high and shorters are starting to get nipped, as in our example.  I keep thinking this though.... and the price keeps going down.  It has leveled out though it seems... maybe it will stay this way for a while before trending up again.  If we see shorters keep getting margin called by these spikes up it might be time to make some longs again as the market is having a tough time pushing lower.

Hopefully things stabilize around this price range....then a slow rise..... Then some mooning again.  I think it's a good time.... But I thought it was a good time at every dip in this cycle.......so what do I know.  You may want to buy in increments over a period of time. It's called cost averaging.  Just buy $100 a week for 2 months...... Or 50 a week over 4 months depending on the scale you want to average over.  This will give you an average buy in price no matter which way the market moves over that time.  Number one rule is you don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:31:46
does everyone know that last auction is coming or something?

@_date: 2015-04-01 04:56:38
Total speculation alert....... I don't even believe this, but a potential scenario would be draper winning the entire auction (which he did)..... Then the govt buying all the coin back from him in a non suspicious way.  Using draper as kinda a middleman. Draper collects a fee for his service and the govt gets the coins back almost for free.   No slippage except for what was already priced into the market at the time of the auction.
@_date: 2015-04-30 10:00:10

@_date: 2015-04-30 12:12:02
basically you borrow bitcoin from someone willing to loan it to you at interest.  You immediately sell it upon receiving the bitcoin.  You then wait until the market goes lower, then you try to buy back in again at a lower price.  You get to keep the fiat profit made by the market moving down.  You pay back the BTC loan and the interest on the bitcoin you borrowed, and end up with some fiat profits.  Its a reverse process for long positions.
the reason this can not work forever is that market can only go so low.  If you take out a short and the market does not go down as you predicted it would by shorting, and the market goes up.... you then end up with a btc loan that is losing you money, on top of the interest you are already paying on the loan..... eventually you can get margin called where you are forced to close your position and eat the loss which is sort of what happened to the guy we are talking about... i dont think he was technically margin called but more like his position was liquidated automatically.....

I know they say "past performance doesn't gaurantee bla bla bla" but from what i've seen bitcoin is pretty fractal..... things repeat.  Its really anybodys guess but signs like this could be seen as bullish.  Lot of good stuff going on as far as bullish signs.  3 day ema crossing, 5 green 1w candles..... i'm hopeful.  Bears got me so beat up tho..... i think we all walk on egg shells these days saying things look bullish.  I really hope the current set up leads to another bubble or maybe some sustained growth at least.  I really like what happens right after the setup you outlined.

you can get a stop payment on the $1600.  I mistakenly bought 20 btc instead of $20 worth and was able to get it straight with my bank.  Coinbase was NO help.  Call your bank and get it reversed.  It might cost you like $30 to put the stop on it, but way better than $1600.

see.  Back in the day we used to use cd roms to install a program that let us enable our phone lines to make terrible noises and connect us to the "internet".

They get clicks.....  Nobody is clicking on the link that says "Bitcoin keeps on chugging without problems while transaction volume slowly increases".  Bloggers are competing for table scraps.... so arguments are going to come from the extremes to polarize their audience and hopefully get a click out of it.  If an article comes from an extreme side then people on both sides of the argument might click it to get a rise from it and reinforce their own beliefs.  Its the same with all news media.  Extreeeeeeme journalism!

Not that they knew it was the ATH but do you think you could resist digging up a time capsule if you knew it was suddenly worth thousands..... Not like it would be a forgotten about time capsule... Bitcoin isn't that old.  I would have realized I made a stupid decision leaving coin in there and done something about it.  I'm sure the first time you got in a financial pinch you'd start thinking about that btc you shoved in the ground.  Much like the guy who chucked the hard drive with tons of btc on it into the dump......that guy searched for that drive forever after Bitcoin took off. I think people are still trying to find that buried treasure... Digging through trash.

Pretty ingenious plan hiding in plain sight.  Could the ultimate plan to be to have it waiting just in case it really hit the fan globally?  It came out well timed with the 2008 crash.  Maybe it was feared we might not recover and they decided to deploy the technology when there was fear of a real collapse?

The more the merrier.  People should be involved as much as they possibly can if they feel interested.  Maybe the blockchain will become so big only large data centers will be full nodes.... One day.

And on that news the difficulty has jumped 7.75%.  I think the emperor is completely without clothes at this point.  Was there a legitimate cloud miner out there?  Was it just CEXio?  And I didn't even see a hash rate drop when they suspended operations.....  Are these cloud miners just really small fish we wouldn't notice in the hash rate chart?

I think if we saw those coins move the market would crash hard because everyone would know that huge mass of coins were back in play. I really hope he can stay away for a very long time.
