To expand a little, the security comes from the long block chain. The nonce is iterated until the hash of those components has the certain number of zeros to satisfy the difficulty. When this happens the block is solved, sent to other miners for verification, and you get the block reward. In order to alter a transaction in a previous block, someone would have to resolve that blocks hash plus the hash of every block that comes afterwards. So to ever catch up to the network and pass their fake blockchain off as real, they would need a computer faster than the bitcoin network.

I am concerned about global warming, to get that out of the way. I haven't seen any of the math behind bitcoin's energy consumption that I actually agree with. I'll do a little back of the envelope math. Lets assume the whole bitcoin network is run on older ASIC technology that has been superseded by more efficient hardware, like a 330mh/s USB block erupter. I'm sure there's a lot of regular CPUs still mining, maybe malware that hasn't been noticed yet, and some might still be GPU mining, but they're the exception at this point.  
  
To run the whole network on erupters, you would need about 130MW of power. That is a huge amount of energy compared to anything we deal with on a daily basis, but its very small on the global scale. A coal or nuclear power plant put out 100-4,000+MW. The hoover dam puts out 2,000MW. The Three Gorges dam puts out a staggering 22,000 MW. The Emma Maersk, a cargo ship, puts out 120MW, and its powered by the largest combustion engine in the world, not a mix of nuclear/hydro/solar/renewable with the coal and gas. This is an oversimplification since its based on power, not emissions, and ignores plant efficiencies, but Bitcoin is a drop in the bucket of everything in the world. If the network was run entirely on the latest generation of ASICs you'd only need 31MW, so we're already getting much more efficient and reducing the future power consumption of the network. Older devices will become unprofitable and be taken off line.

Several people I know were fucked over by Cryptsy when their trading engine allowed my friends to double trade doge, putting their accounts into a negative balance. When contacted Cryptsy admitted no responsibility, blamed the double trade on my friends' actions, and wanted them to deposit more BTC to make up for the loss. They simply walked away from the exchange instead. If cryptsy really allowed the buying party to withdraw those coins, they're missing coins. And this is only 2-3 people out of the 7-8 people I know of who trade alts. I have to imagine the problem is widespread.

They can stipulate up front they only take seashells, or bitcoin, or whatever.

Its mostly because the majority of your questions or critcisms are relatively minor ones in the grand scheme of bitcoin. Its like complaining that emails are too hard to send in 1995 because you have to buy an incredibly expensive machine, tie up a phone line, few people even have email accounts, and why would anyone ever need email anyway since we have the US Postal Service who will deliver a letter or information to *literally any business or home anywhere*. Surely people aren't going to give up a secure, easy to use paper letter for these electronic-mail messages that pretty much require a CS degree to understand. And then lets say you needed to use snail mail to setup an email account. You're complaining that an email account (buying bitcoins) is so hard to setup because it takes forever due to the flaws of the USPS.  
  So none of your criticisms are inherent to email (bitcoin) its just the state of the technology and industry.

Do you spend time looking at any live charts for the exchanges? Manipulation is completely obvious when it happens. Couple thousand coin buy/sell walls appear and disappear in minutes while large amounts of coins are bought and sold. If you are an early comer with thousands or tens of thousands of BTC, you can drive the price in any direction you want, especially in times of low volume between bubbles.   
  
Why is manipulation that hard to believe? Why wouldn't huge players with hundreds millions or billions of dollars to gain spend time and money to ensure they achieve those gains? We've just heard about the LIBOR scandal. JP Morgan drove trucks full of aluminum in circles to increase delivery times and jack the price up. Few if anyone has been punished in those cases, the cases that have come to light. How many scandals like that are yet to be uncovered? If you can blatantly manipulate markets that are supposedly regulated, bitcoin would be a cake walk.

Some will do that, others will buy and hold like they do for thousands of other conventional stocks. Actually, I think it will bring more holders to the table, because things like IRAs and other funds don't just trade like their ass is on fire.

Why would they need to announce they consider it bartering? Trade commodity A for another commodity/item.   
It might not take off for small every day purchases, but it could still be very handy for larger trades/purchases.

I don't understand exactly what your argument is. A few months ago, people didn't buy giftcards, or Subway sandwiches with bitcoin. A few years ago, nobody bought pizza with bitcoin. Up to last week, nobody bought space trips with bitcoin. We've seen nothing *but* businesses start to accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:29:06
If they use existing companies that run the gift card sections in most stores these days, then I don't really see it being a problem.

I don't know what my true overall political leanings are. Some things like welfare and min wage I believe can be good, but I'm also not sure printing money willy nilly is for the best interest of everyone. Your post seems just about as disingenuous as the supposed re-writing of history. Inflationary money has existed for hundreds of years, perhaps not inflationary by design, but inflationary none the less. Welfare has been around since Roman times. China had income tax in 10AD. The automobile was invented 15 years before your picture. Those points notwithstanding, you're taking one sole picture and trying to make a point about a country as a whole. I don't know the answer to any of the points about deflation, and gold backed currency, but god man, get your facts straight before you attempt to make a point.  
  
If the Olympic games were held in [Rwanda/Kenya/troubled nation], you're taking a picture of the nice, new, bright olympic park and saying there are no problems in [Rwanda/Kenya/troubled nation] because [picture].

But the current rate won't be current much longer. Also that 100,000 BTC is "only" 0.7% of the entirety of mined bitcoins, and an even higher percentage of total bitcoins still in existence.

Its impossible to run out of bitcoin before 2140. The rate of creation is based on a geometric series, and the amount of coins produced every 4 years is cut in half. If it wasn't for the 8 decimal limit, you could mine bitcoins for eternity.
