Yea, everyone is saying this today.  But there were plenty of rises and crashes before that you more than likely would have sold the majority at.  Remember it hit $1000 for a while back in 2013 and then fell to $200-$300 ish?  Or how about when it hit 5K and then tumbled back down to 2/3k.  There are so many "this is it moments, i want out" along the way it's really hard to say you would have the courage to ride it all the way through when you were so skeptical about the initial purchase.
Could you have been one of the people that lost their wallets, forgot their keys, or the victim of one of the many hacks/scams (mt gox, cryptsy, bitfinex)?  Would you have got into alt coins and lost/gained that way?
Could you have been one of the folks that actually *used* bitcoin (and contributed to its success)?
It's hard to say what would have happened unless it actually has happened.
Life goes on, enjoy it. :)

If you cant lose all of it, dont do it.  If you can lose all of it, does it matter if you should?

Real bitcoiners use unrelated metrics for measuring value and worth.

Having said that, I actually keep a dump of my private keys dropbox.  The file itself is encrypted via gpg with a strong passphrase, which is stored in a "block device" (holding all my other backup data) using LUKS and also a strong passphrase.  The encyrpted "block device" file is packaged to look like another file type, so using mime/magic to identify "target files" in a broad hack is less likely.  I think the one other thing I could do is split it and put into multiple accounts to make it even harder to put together.
And I even feel like that is a bit risky, but I cant think have a better way that would be 100% fireproof.  People say use, paper, hardware wallets, but all that can go up in a fire.  People do not recommend storing on exchanges, because access can be locked, exchanges can be hacked, it's all very risky.  But I also expect a reliable exchange to be more well versed in protecting your crypto.
I may even regret exposing my backup technique as now people know to look for that ;)
(If I mistaken about hardware wallets and the ability to recover in the event of destroyed/lost hardware, please let me know cause I would do that ASAP)
EDIT: If you're wonder why I dont just backup the wallet.dat, I do, but I dont trust it.  Private Keys will always be importable.

That's the spirit!
If it makes you feel better I sold my dash masternode at the start of 2017, for 20k, now valued at 1.1million.

\&gt; since 2008
Your "start" is in mid 2007 before the 2008 crash of everything.

What is the implementation used to generate addresses?  Software will change over 24 years, they may need to be able to go back to the original BIP documentation and implement themselves.
They also have to trust the seed phrase and/or keys will not be lost or compromised while in your hands?  You just made yourself a public target having access to at least 3 BTC.  That may not be a lot to some of us, but it may be some day, and it will be to someone.   You now have to watch your back for the next 24 years ;)

to point  when I buy altcoins i get round amounts, and if I end up with an extra 1e-8 ill buy 'one more' and then sell it to get the round number.
but yea, this seems fishy.
