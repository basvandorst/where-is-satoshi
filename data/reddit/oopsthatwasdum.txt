I am no sure who is downvoting this, I am offering .2 BTC to someone who has the expertise to do what may be as simple as solder a very simple cracked circuit board.

That is a good idea. I have a couple of the same model. They appear to be designed to be difficult to crack open (molded plastic around everything), but I'm going to give one of the test units an acetone bath and see if I can get to the inside after that.

Going to leave this here for future internet travelers. If you find that the metal housing around the USB-C connector is damaged at all, carefully inspect the pins on the inside for any damage or misalignment. It is possible for the power pins to make contact, but the data pins to not make contact. In that case, the yubikey will flash an error code, and yubico will tell you that all they can do is to replace it for you. A careful realignment of the pins using a magnifying glass and tiny tools may be possible. 
If not, then you have a harder job ahead. The plastic casing can be dissolved with an acetone bath, but there is a thick coating of some kind of epoxy or epoxy-like material over the connections from the board to the usb-c connector, that also seems to help provide structural support. Unless you are really good at soldering, and maybe even microsoldering, replacing the usb-C connector itself could be risky. 
Bottom line, just because you are getting an error code doesn't mean all hope is lost. Buy a couple more keys to practice on and explore, and you might still get lucky! Note, even if you can realign the pins or fix any damage, you should replace the yubikey as soon as possible.

Thanks for the idea. Unfortunately, recovering the yubikey is the only way.

Thanks. I realize the delicacy of this operation. That is why I am trying to find someone who is a pro at this by offering a bounty.
