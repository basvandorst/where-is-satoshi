I want to help make this happen. I'm not based in the states, so can host it. I found this thread by searching for exactly this. 
Here's how we can get it done. 
1. Choose a name.
2. Create a SubReddit for this with this name
3. Create a website that proves the legitimacy. I.e. showing the complete blockchain history for the lottery wallet, the available balance (winnings) and the history of payouts
4. Start taking payments, and start initially manually paying out every week. 
The prizes need to payout a significant proportion of the population. Due to the low overhead, i would suggest that the Maximum prize should be 25% of the pot, and then we payout at least 25% of the entries with at least the cost of the ticket to a total of another 65%. 10% of the pot stays to pay out the admins, the server costs and other stuff. 
Ticket prices need to be low to encourage people to take a chance. How about 0.1mBTC (~$0.10 USD) 
To enter, all you have to do is send at least 0.1mBTC to the lottery address, from there, we can work out who put in, and 
The draw resets every week, and winnings are payed out immediately. (possible because we have the money in the wallet) and not relying on Forex or trades to happen. 
We can then somehow, optionally connect the wallet id's to redditors to show that we are actually paying out real people. Maybe some kind of entirely optional sign up. 
Its low risk to us, as we are not paying out in advance, and low risk to users as its small change just now until we get some kind of critical mass. 
Note: Sorry for the new username, but even though I'm not in the states, I'd prefer not to have this too connected to my other accounts.
