Yeah, at the pace it's downloading, it will take me weeks to get the whole blockchain, assuming I leave the computer running 24/7.

I'm using 14.1 too, on a fast computer.
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:59:45
I'm screwed. But what else am I supposed to do, bury a box in my yard?
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:06:33
That might explain why all the altcoins are in such a ridiculous bubble right now, if these people are manipulating everything.
Example: Back in March, Bytecoin was worth 8 million dollar. Today, it's worth 800 million. That's ridiculous and not going to end well.

Well, I hope it will update. The last time I tried to get it to fully synch, apparently something went wrong while Bitcoin was active, thereby forcing me to delete everything except my wallet and my blockchain, thus I effectively had to start over.

Alts always rise more when Bitcoin skyrockets, but then they crash again when the bubble is over.
@_date: 2017-05-11 19:20:17
The big deal is the fact that it's taking me weeks to synchronize at this pace. This is the wallet that contains my Bitcoin balance. I can't access it until it's done synchronizing. I'd say that's a pretty big deal.

That doesn't work for me. I have electrum on my computer, it won't let me import my private keys.

If that's how UASF is activated, it's not going to be activated. Regular Joe Sixpacks like me won't bother with that stuff, Bitcoin is complicated enough as it is already.

I haven't got the slightest clue what I'm supposed to be doing myself. Assuming a 1 MB/s download speed, it's going to take days of my computer running consistently just for me to get a full blockchain and get access to my fricking Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:08:28
Thanks. I will look into pruning mode. Hopefully that will resolve this situation.
@_date: 2017-05-11 20:02:33
Thanks, very helpful.
The Bitcoin Wiki says:


So, I shouldn't be exporting my private keys, yet I can't access my Bitcoin without exporting them. Great technology A++++

In my experience, it takes forever. People like you and me were deceived back in 2013 by all these people who told us to install a full node.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:06:33
Thanks for the kind words, it's duly appreciated.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:10:34
Yeah I may be back eventually. I want to be out before the chaos I anticipate when the fork issue unfolds.
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:44:30
I cashed out through Bitonic, a big Dutch site that works with our local payment protocols. They sent me an email announcing they'll deposit the money on my bank account tomorrow, so how the bank will respond to this still remains to be seen.

Here you go:
Because most of the miners don't support segwit, they can quite easily carry out a 51% attack against the segwit chain. The effect this would have is to reverse transactions, thereby causing economic chaos. It could destroy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:41:30
Sure, but that's not the point. The point is: Individuals generally don't carry out bidirectional payments. I buy from a store, I don't sell something to the same store.
It's the big merchant and exchange organizations that have bidirectional payment traffic going on. As a consequence, this technology is only going to be useful if people make their Bitcoin transactions through such intermediaries, which has the effect of taking away the control out of your own hands.

Stop spreading FUD, one bitcoin will be worth 10 trillion dollar. It can only go up^up^up!

What is the meaning of life? Do dogs go to heaven when they die?

Buying something because it increased in a value so much is the exact reason economic bubbles form.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:35:52
This kills the Bitcoin.

Miners have a perverse incentive. As the block reward goes down, they depend on transactions to keep their operation profitable. The transactions only cost money when there's a permanent artificial scarcity of blockchain capacity. If you control a sufficient portion of the hashrate, you'll find it profitable to start increasing the number of transactions.
Satoshi never envisioned mining centralizing the way it has and the consequences that would follow. If you want this project to survive, you need to move away from POW or change the POW algorithm.
