It's amazing how many of these addresses are not multisig
@_date: 2016-08-25 00:21:04
Multisig and has a nice clean interface, I'm a fan.

The publicity would be exciting but it would perpetuate an image of an immature technology only used by criminals and drug dealers.

It's not so big yet to be a threat. From what I can see, a lot seem to be very interested in the tech and are doing deep research

In a user acquisition stage experimentation with the service is more valuable. IMHO there should be a 0 cent minimum and artists and submitters can choose what fee to apply.
Having a 9cent min reduces the total views and repeat users. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 11:10:30
9 cent minimum, although low, is not low enough.

I love the app, thanks. One strange bug when copying addresses to receive i found when pasted using IOS the paste included "bitcoin:" followed by the public address ?

There has been a lot of discussion regarding Bitcoin price as the value has fluctuated however something which rarely appears as part of the discussion is the influence of the technical development, perceived development potential and scalability/acceptance of future development direction.
How much do you think the developmental aspect of Bitcoin influences the market value? 
@_date: 2014-09-11 17:25:58
I created an account to experience the process up to the payment stage. I clicked on the pay with Bitcoin button, I was a little excited waiting to see a QR code and the page crashed.

I enjoyed this line.
"The list of horrors put out by these mildly esteemed bodies is a virtual cut-and-paste effort, looking for the most damaging words without revealing any true issues.  Where were these same bodies to warn us about the dangers of toxic subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations a mere decade ago" 
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:11:29
None, but this information wouldn't put downward pressure on the value.

I should; I had checked the Blockchain merchant map feature on my way in and its still up. I think it runs on Coinmap.

Great link, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:56:58
Thank you for your reply, I'll check out the site. 
Regarding your question I don't think it would make much of difference if Dish is available in China, information is instantly global. All it would take is one IM and someone with big funds to start trading.  
I would have thought news like this might support the price today but the market  appears to be acting as if the information was already known. I might be overvaluing it's significance in the scheme of things..
@_date: 2014-10-31 18:47:37
The price keeps falling because the regulatory environment has shown its stormy conditions, the rate of acceptance will be slower than had been considered over the last year and it's being reflected in the price.

This is a worrying sign, I hope this does not represent a wave of mainstream push-back due to Bitcoin's increasing popularity and viability. As Bitcoin grows we are bound to experience defensive measures by the current financial system to stem the tide. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 22:02:50
I like your idea have a biscuit @_date: 2014-09-03 18:48:59
It's very likely that The Fappening has increased Bitcoin searches due to the pictures being released after Bitcoin donations. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 15:26:14
Great, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 23:42:51
I would love for a fraction of Bitcoins to be called Bits! Alas it would be very confusing for the less technically or literately competent.
It's agreeable to assume the goal is to achieve an easily understood domination and so I like 100 Satoshi as a reference point, it seems like a very reasonable place to frame the scale. 
As for other options I would really enjoy paying in Blips.

There is a communications issue at the heart of a lot of these posts. All of these topics have been discussed before. Many problems have been identfied and many problems have been solved over the years in Bitcoin. 
I like this post because it reminds us Bitcoin needs to improve continuously. We also need to communicate to each new user in a simple manner where we have come from and are going to. 
Does anyone have a source on a Bitcoin roadmap? I do not k ow of such a thing exists.

The drop off in volume is closely linked to the increase in price volatility - it messes with people's heads.

The bitfinex hack makes acceptance much less likely.
@_date: 2016-09-13 00:01:28
Thanks for your answer. 
As I understand so far, the bitcoin blockchain is a record of transactions. But a limited amount of data can be stored after OP_RETURN Script function holding up to 80kb. This could be readable text or a hash.
Therefore the bitcoin blockchain records a fingerprint of a file or document that has to be stored elsewhere. 
Can blockchain explorers be used to scan blocks for information after OP_RETURN which then might trigger an event off chain?
