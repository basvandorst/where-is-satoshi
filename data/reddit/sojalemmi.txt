Yeah, that appears to be the consensus. I wish I woulda done better research before making my move, but I was just so excited to get started. I have been trying to use coinbase, signed up a couple days ago, just waiting for my bank account verification, pnc doesn't allow instant for some reason, and I didn't understand bitinstant real well till now.
Thanks for the response.

Well what would be a good way to get bitcoins then? It seemed like the consensus on reddit was that blockchain.info had the best wallet to start with. Is there something better? Or what is a better way to get funds?

Yea, I am short .17 btc and it is driving me crazy. I mite have to spend a bunch more money just to get a couple more bux into my account. I am so pissed off rite now. I just wish I could do an instant type thing.
I signed up to coinbase, but it is taking a while to verify. I just want to get all this stuff done with, and of course it can't be easy. Of course I am .17 btc short.

I have. But apparently nobody else who contacted support is getting any responses. Its a waiting game. I have already been waiting so much, I want to be done waiting. Everything was supposed to be good to go today. Now I am waiting again because I am a god damned .17 btc short.

Secondlife, eh? I really really want to be able to do something like an instant transfer, like VirWox that you are talking about, cuz I am lazy and I dont care much about the fee, i just need .17 btc QUICK! But you are saying I need to pay for secondlife to get there?

Have you ever wanted to take control of your currency? You can be your own banker and operate outside of the strangled financial system. You can buy or sell with no fees. Get in on bitcoins now, while it is new, be one of the pioneers. Now is the time to invest, get in ahead of the game.
BTC is a new form of digitized, universal currency. Cyberspace is the new frontier, we are entering the heart of the digital age, and BTC is the future of finances. BTC is safe and easy to use, and soon they will be even easier to acquire.
Remember when Paypal was just starting out? If you would have bought stocks then, when they were cheap, you could be rich right now for how Paypal took off. Well now BTC is just starting out, and it is all so much simpler than playing the stock market. You can buy coins and your investment is made. No trader fees to pay. No confusing mumbo jumbo. Just simple bitcoins.
There are more and more opportunities everyday for BTC, and it can only grow. Now is the time to buy. It is so easy that a child could do it after a 10 min. internet search, and soon, it will be as easy as using a credit card to acquire BTC.
That is my pitch. I hope you pick me, haha.
Cheers everybody, happy new year.

Just so I can get it clarified, will I automatically be notified some how about that tip that willem left me? Like, will I get an orange envelope that says something about it, with directions to get those coins into a wallet somewhere?
Thanks for your further assistance. I really appreciate it.

No, never heard of localbitcoins. I will check it out. I will check out bitstamp too. I have already looked at bitinstant, and for now that seems to be the option I will go with to make future deposits. I went to MtGox, but I don't have any proof of residency to get verified, so I kinda thinking meh.
I wish I was smarter, this stuff is not hard but it is confusing me. Reminds me that I'm actually dumb, haha. Oh well.
Thanks for your help.

Thanks for the responses, guys, I really appreciate it. Yes, I am a confirmed level 2 and ready to start making instant purchases. I just wanted to be sure this news was not to good to be true. I will never get BTC any other way, now that it is instant thru coinbase. I am so excited, so happy. SR, here I come, haha.

Yea, I have had an account since Jan. and I have already made a few transactions, so I am all set for instant BTC. I just wanted to confirm that this is really happening. Thanks for your response.
@_date: 2013-01-01 00:31:31
no, not yet. Looking into it right now. But in case I can't figure it out...how? hah. thanks.
EDIT: I think the bot or whatever might be down right now. willem said it should be there, where ever there is, when it is back up and running, hah.
Thanks for everyone's help, and thank you willem for your generosity. It really means a lot, saves me a huge headache, and almost makes up for the bitcoins I lost somewhere along the way. I love you guys.

I got verified right away. Based on what I saw other people saying, maybe you have insufficient data because you are young and/or have no credit history. I believe that is where they pull the info from, your credit history, so if you don't really have any, then there will be insufficient data for questions.
