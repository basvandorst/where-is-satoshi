this just a mere reflection of recent drop. but the bigger picture still remains same, bitcoin rules 
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:00:29
why do they decide what is legal or not? one's country government should make out appropriate system of law to make easy using btc and make all regulations in this field

1) Closed Ecosystem 
2) They didn't allow the Blockchain app on purpose it doesn't do anything but have a QR code to a Bitcoin Wallet through blockchain
3) Read only apps are work-arounds made by the community to help the apple user who want to use Bitcoin
4) Apple wants to maintain its monopoly 30% revenue share from the App store and does not see Bitcoin giving it a share of the cut
In conclusion Apple is just protecting its monopoly status and does not give a damn about the end user especially after Jobs died.

Give 1 btc away and invest the rest in altcoins

That's great! I'd love to get paid in bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:13:38
Why I am not surprised while reading this?? MtGox command were a big scammers

Blockchain for online wallet, use only for small spends
I like Electrum, think it's pretty intuitive to use
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:49:04
pretty funny i must admit.
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:52:52
great news for bitcoin community in st. ptsbrg...
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:48:06
It's not just important to me. It's the number one concern.
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:48:40
I think that Ireland is the first country that has own cryptocurrency
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:51:12
Berlin, London, Singapore, New York are all credible and likely candidates
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:48:48
And wallets/wallet providers should also be listed, or linked to, so that it helps people along better than just some instructions. Linking to the list of wallets on the bitcoin website would be a good idea.
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:19:20
Well even if the government get his piece of pie isn't that great that we it is the largest and cryptocurrency is using in China? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:39:17
I think this is where most of the bitcoin related taxes will take place. I think larger business will likely need to play the role of taxman by collecting sales tax on transactions, and income taxes on bitcoin (capital gains tax) will likely eventually fall by the wayside.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:05:34
are these ATMs are safety enough? by the way this guy looks happy
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:35:06
Lol ! No wonder they do it as they have such "Dark" name ! :)

I don't see how they could use any service other then one that controls the private keys. If the company that was providing this service had anything but 100% control of the private keys then it would be too easy to rip off the company.
I do have one question about this service though: what happens when you use this card for something like gas or for a meal at a restaurant. At these types of places the merchant will place a temporary hold on the account for the estimated amount of the transaction. Then several days later they will cancel the hold and present a new transaction with the actual amount being charged. What exchange rate would the customer have to pay? I am almost certain that the answer is the rate at the time the transaction is finalized. The problem with this is that it would essentially give coinbase (or whatever other service) inside information about future sales. If there is an uptick in the number of gas station and restaurant transactions then they would know there will be selling pressure in coming days and could potentially trade ahead of this happening.

of course it's CIA and when they want to finish the project
dump the 'Satoshi Nakamoto' stash......sorted

I really do not know. I don't know enough of the exchange's owner's goals to make an informed decision.
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:54:06
Not sure what you read, but...
@_date: 2014-08-30 15:53:05
This is expected because Bitcoin is spreading like wild fire. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:37:12
I don't think transaction times are that much of an issue. I think people think they are but those usually haven't even sent bitcoins before. 
I'm not sure what I'd change personally. Seems pretty solid to me at the moment.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:54:37
Additional damage for new depositors? what the hell does it mean?
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:48:23
Not bad, but a I think that it needs more about how mining works and the like. It is fairly good, but there all always be stuff that has to be improved.
@_date: 2014-07-28 05:32:55
They may very well aim to try and keep their money rolling in, or they could embrace it, or let said exchanges co-exist with no complaints.
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:39:58
very easy, put Vienna in the search box and press enter
the one you mentioned is probably in sector5 coworking workspace

The amount of total margin being used is public information on bitfinex. A whale could make their bitcoin be available to be borrowed, and when their offer is accepted they know that someone is using it for margin. They see the total margin in use from public data. If, when it comes time to renew the loan to traders, the whale declines and withdraws their coins from the exchange then there would not be enough BTC to borrow so people would be forced to sell to close their positions. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:46:35
I'll be another one 
@_date: 2014-03-16 20:26:48
It is just current situation and if you look back than you can see that there as times people also think prices wouldn't change but they did !

if only people could buy tickets to Sochi Olympics with bitcoins! It would be much better.
@_date: 2014-09-06 12:36:06
Blockchain.info has an app for iphone.
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:53:53
there is only one suggestion: forget about all of this!
@_date: 2014-07-14 05:01:41
Mark does need to "find" another huge pile of BTC, hopefully soon.
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:39:27
Sounds just like trying to spread a bit of fear because they fear it themselves. They obviously fear what they do no understand.
@_date: 2014-03-13 21:57:12
You are absolutely right! Kraken is awesome. Despite it is "young" I think it's gonna be the biggest service in teh near future
