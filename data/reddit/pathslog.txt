To be fair, Ubuntu is becoming very much Windomized. For the common user desktop, extensions are now being associated with "preferred applications". Links and shortcuts are now easy to create and the line between content files and applications is beginning to disappear.

I'm not sure why this would be considered so innovative. Seems like a rip off from the [SQRL]( project, which is an ongoing, active development.
It provides the exact same features, as well as the same pitfalls (ie: out-of-band auth, like the one presented in the video, is not realiable and there are no easy answers to resolve its isssues). Overall, I fail to see a significant relation between public key auth and bitcoin wallets and addresses. I don't see how it makes any sense to merge these concepts.

Regardless of who did the search, has it been established that the servers were "bought" not "rented"?
I'm used to seeing people rent servers all the time from companies that provide the hardware. If he was renting the server farm, I would expect the equipment to still be registered under the name of the service provider. Would Ulbircht have legal rights over the contents of a server he rented, not really owned in his name?

There's an infinite number of ways to screw up and lose cash from your wallet as well. The problem is not inherent to bitcoins. If it has real value, it just needs to be treated as real cash. Not just some "risky virtual investment fund".

This might've been answered in other threads, which I haven't had the time to read all of them.
But I'm certainly curious as to why would anyone leave large ammounts of BTC sitting in an online exchange wallet. Personally, I'd have bitcoins in that wallet ONLY when I needed them exchanged, and would immediately move them to a secure wallet once the exchange is done.
Besides convinience, was there any good reason for this practice that led to people losing thousands of bitcoins? Or can we just assume they were taking the risk unecessarily?
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:04:11
Not meaning to highjack the top comment here, but you are right. First, and importantly, people need to stop saying that bitcoin is a "virtual currency created out of thin air". This statement is fundamentally a metaphore and all it does is confuse the common person.
Bitcoin is real, based on advanced cryptography, maintained by real physical machines. Simplistically, it's just a public ledger kept simultaneously in many computers around the world.

The public ledger is their best allie against cyber crime. If they wish to get serious, they will USE the bitcoin network to their advantage, assign REAL experts to assemble their own servers mining for blocks and cross reference fiat transactions with bitcoin transactions in smart data mining.
If (or when) the FBI starts doing that, Bitcoin itself will eventually be disassociated from terms like "criminal" or "money laundering" and be considered for what it really is: the currency of the future.

@_date: 2012-05-25 12:26:23
I think you nailed it. This is pretty much all there is to say.
The only files exchanged in the Bitcoin network are the ones related to the ledger database. Everyone has a copy of it and everyone contributes to maintain its integrity in a distributed effort. The only way to disrupt the service is to corrupt the block chain in a massive, large (currently inconceivable) scale.
I don't see that happening anytime soon.
@_date: 2012-11-29 19:01:07
It's possible to begin a whole different bitcoin by specifying a new primary block. Not much use for a distributed network. It real strength is in the distributed nature and the number of users in it.
@_date: 2012-06-27 17:41:41
Yes, it's ambiguous. But given the nature of how Bitcoin works and that Freicoin is based on it, many would just assume that the 4.4% tax is being collected by miners. They are the only ones running the software in a way that helps to maintain and keep the network secure. Everyone else is just 'users'.
@_date: 2012-05-10 02:22:20
Transfering bitcoins around does not make them untraceable. The ledger is completely open and all coins **can** be traced all the way back to the original transaction block where they were first generated (when someone earned them by mining). This may take an excessive computing power today and the ammount of criminal activites currently using this currency simpy does not justify the expense..... yet.
The ledger by itself does not give away the user's identities, but it does leave a clear trail of where each of the coins are going. It's possible to see where they flow and which wallets are keeping them. So, unless criminals decide to use bitcoins in its pure form for all their negotiations and NEVER convert them to dollars or any other fiat currency, then **yes** it is possible to trace money laundering.
In order to acquire bitcoins in large quantities you need to buy them through an exchange... using fiat money. There's your entry point from real world. With enough computing power, it is possible to trace ALL THOSE COINS acquired at the exchange. If you are a criminal, you'd better stick with the bitcoin format for the rest of your life. At the moment you cash out into a fiat currency, the feds can pin point where they money is going to. Because **at that moment** there will be a real person receiving real dollars for those coins... and not just a wallet address anymore.
The only reason why bitcoin is giving us some anonimity today is because no government nor any official agency is concerned enough to monitor the ledger extensively.
@_date: 2012-12-05 20:07:24
I usually try to explain bitcoins in the simplest way. When we say bitcoins are virtual and they don't exist physically, that is **literally true**.
To understand bitcoins, let's imagine Bob, Alice and John want to start their very own bitcoin network. Since bitcoins aren't real, we just "pretend" they exist. It's like fake money from a boardgame. All they need is a ledger (i.e. a paper notebook) to keep records of how much each person has. For bitcoins, this ledger is a database of transaction records in your PC.
At the very beginning, we need to create bitcoins to start somewhere. For the sake of this explanation, let's forget about mining and we'll just write down on the ledger:
* Bob has 10BTC
* Alice has 10BTC
* John has 0BTC.
Now, if Alice wants to transfer 5BTC to John, again we simply write on the ledger, adding new lines:
* Alice transfered 5BTC to John
* Alice has 5BTC
* John has 5BTC.
Each line on the ledger has the signature of the people involved in the transaction so it can be verified. Verification is possible because the ledger is public. And this is the brilliance of Bitcoins... Everyone has a copy of this ledger for themselves in their PC, and there is no central authority controlling it. We say bitcoin is distributed because if you wish to make a transaction, this information is *distrubuted* to everyone in the network so it can be verified. And that's what keeps the system running. Millions of bitcoin programs running and making sure no one double spends their coins.
Everyone using Bitcoins has a copy of this ledger and transactions are sent to everyone so the entire network can verify and double check. Only after a good enough number of peers verify the transaction, you can spend the coins you received - that is, create new transactions with those coins.
So, in fact, the only thing that can be said to really exist is the ledger (**the  blockchain**) and the addresses that send and receive these "pretend" coins.
I hope this helps.

The way I see it, is that people keep referring back to "tangible" assets as if that was actually necessary for a currency to exist.. as if that was *good thing*... as if currency needed to be tangible, or be the promise of something tangible, in order to have any value. But I understand differently, actually quite the opposite.
Having a tangible asset to guarantee the value of currency creates a **centralized point of failure** to all economies that are based on that currency. Either by a strong force of nature or by uncontrollable events, if the people or institution controlling the currency are destroyed then all of its based economy and value goes down with it. If you control the source of money, you control the society that depends on it.
We **must** remember. The value of tangible assets is by itself an **intangible perception**. Gold has value, because we choose to see value in it, based on its natural properties that make it scarce and unique.
As a programmer, I understand *how* Bitcoin works. And I can vouch personally -- from what I already know -- that Bitcoin gives the same tangible properties needed for a currency, just as gold (unique, scarce, whatever). Except that, with BTC you take away the **tangible liability** of crashing or controlling an entire economy based on the destruction or will of a centralized institution. With BTC, there is no centralized control. Much like the Internet itself, if any group using BTC goes down, the rest of the community does not crash and burn entirely because of it.
If anything, money has long moved away from being "tangible assets" to a mere "promise of value" from financial authorities; a centralized structure that has given plenty of room for corruption and social manipulation of wealth.
BTC itself doesn't need to survive, but it will certainly become the starting point, when things began to change for the better. The real challenge for these new online currencies is to gain popularity and strength to overcome the mighty hand of financial institutions, who certainly have no idea how to survive in a world where they no longer control wealth, its and movements.

Bitcoin mining process is made more difficult on purpose as part of the effort to distribute a limited number of coins for early adopters and the prize accumulated into each block by transaction fees.
The block creation here could be simplified and allow clients to easily create blocks without much effort, minimizing CPU/GPU cycles. There would be no financial incentive, only the incentive to keep the network secure at the low physical cost of processing message transactions into blocks.

I would only add an extra note about anonymity, which tends to get confusing. Only the bitcoin system itself can be considered anonymous. Inside the bitcoin network, there is no correlation between wallet addresses and real people.
However, anything else outside the BTC network can be used to correlate your identity to your BTC wallet. So you could say "bitcoins are as anonymous as you can make them, if you know how".
For example, online wallets keep your email and personal info, which link you to your wallet. Also, correct me if I'm wrong, BTC transactions can be traced back to the timestamp and IP address that originated them. If you are not hiding behind a proxy or a secure network, you can be found by law enforcement, and bitcoins can be traced back to you.
So if anyone is thinking "hey! it's anonymous, so I'll conduct my illegal activities with bitcoins!"... the only reason you haven't been found yet is because no one is looking for you.
@_date: 2012-03-27 18:03:11
It will take sometime, but it will be intersting to see when computers are fast enough to allow this. Anyone with active coins will need to increase the size of their keys. Server farms will rush to find lost keys and some ignorant users who fail to upgrade their wallets will surely see their money fly away.

Well... terms like SHA-256 and public/private key encryption, etc... they may be too advanced for the general public. But if you're making up shit to avoid difficult terms, it doesn't make things easier to understand.... the general public still won't understand anything. It makes no difference if you say something coherent or just mambo jambo....
But it does matter to people who know how these things work. My grandma won't know the difference if you say IP address "342.987.988.2" or  "192.168.1.102".....
If it makes no difference to the general public, then you might as well spend the extra effort and please the experts with something that actually makes sense to them. That counts as extra points into creating a good image for the show.
Otherwise, you're just saying... "i'm too cheap to pay an IT guy for minimal consulting to make sure i'm not saying something stupid here".

But you do that enough times with large quantities of cash and don't they have enough circumstantial evidence to prosecute you? Correct me if I am wrong... but if they keep linking your financial life with criminal underground activities I believe they can bust you.
For large criminal operations, I don't think it will matter if you keep saying "It wasn't for me I was buying them for"... Even if that's true, at the end of the day, it's your name on the line and the larger the operation the harder to prove you didn't know anything about illegal stuff going on.

I'm not sure if I got the article completely. Doesn't it make sense to account for the difficulty level to solve blocks? The difficulty increases accordingly as new hashing power comes into the network. If the network generates 26Thash/s and you wish to input a new 27Thash/s power along with it, wouldn't the difficulty increase dramatically? You are pretty much doubling the hash power! And the protocol is designed to increase difficulty to keep block solving competitive as hardware becomes faster.
You wouldn't be able to solve blocks as easily as you did with 26Thash/s, so you would need a lot more than just extra 27Thash/s to accomplish this.
I am wrong? If this seems impractical as stated int the article, then the difficulty level pretty much makes it even more so.

I wish they would stop posing Bitcoin as a purely anonymous network. 


There's a potential privacy concern, right there. Privacy prevails on the BTC network today because no one is bothering to cross reference addresses and their transactions with the rest of the world. If you don't take extra steps to keep your originating IP secure, authorities can still trace the cash back to you.

I would guess the lack of a central bitcoin authority would make it quite impossible.
PayPal would become the target of endless debates of whether they are breaking the law or not on each and every country they're in. Politicians around the world (meaning: old people, usually not understanding of new technologies) would certainly try to come up with some wacky, nonsensical way of trying to regulate the virtual currency and PayPal would end up spending more on lawyers and political discussions about how BTC should be operated and what it means to that government's financial system.
They probably want to avoid that circus all together by completely severing any bitcoin related activities from their users.

I dare say it's most likely a project developed inside military and/or government by a group of researchers orders of magnitude smarter than your regular high ranking officer. They presented the idea internally. Their superiors frowned and dismissed the whole thing because they couldn't grasp the ground breaking concept. Finally, an official implementation gets rejected due to fear of the unknown. Why would they feel the need to break the current fiat system, which seems to be working pretty well for the ones in charge of the whole thing?
By that point, the group responsible probably had a prototype ready and working, so they silently released it to the world to see what would become of it. Couple of generations later, their story will be uncovered as classified documents are released to the day of light.

If the price of electricity rises too much, I would expect the protocol to be adjusted so it won't consume insane amounts of GPU power only to find leading zeros at the beginning of a hash value. I am sure smart brains out there will figure out a new math formula to keep things running at lower costs.
At the end of the day, mining is really just a mathematical problem. It was originally designed with a "leading zeroes hash" to provide some level of difficulty and randomness on creating new coins and finding transaction fees for profit, but the verification process that keeps the network secure does not rely on it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:19:11
You are forgetting a crucial detail. At the rate of .0000295 hashes per second you would need 24 DAYS to complete one single hash. Now, globally, one block is found at every 10 mins. And everytime a new block is found, you would have to restart from scratch for a new block.
You would never find a single block before anyone else. So, aside from the obvious subjective conclusion... empirically, this is useless.

I'm no stock market expert here.. so I would appreciate if anyone could clarify.
How exactly do 'market makers' do for the market, except manipulate stock prices to keep relative interests under control?
He keeps talking about BTC as if it were meant to be an investment, like people invest in the stock market. We need to remember the real intention of Bitcoin is to serve as CURRENCY, not a commodity. But this "investment" is based on the pure speculation that BTC value will keep rising unsteadily until it reaches a stable value within global economy.
So, yes, of course. There is no 'market order' at this moment. There is a window of opportunity where smart people can make real money.. and this opportunity requires your common stock market expert to think outside the box.
But ultimately, BTC is intended to outlive this frenzy. Eventually, all 21mi BTC will have been mined and if people want to make a profit out of it, they will need to use for what it was meant to be: A CURRENCY.

@_date: 2013-05-07 18:22:26
They are not necessary by protocol design. Mining software is hard coded to give preference to transactions with higher fees in order to accumulate more reward when the next block is found. This isn't necessary for the protocol to work. It's still just there as an incentive. It's a business decision to process some transactions first because of they paid a higher fee.
If, by any chance, miners find a new way to profit from mining other than transaction fees, their software can remove the part of the logic that gives preference to higher fee transactions and continue to find blocks just as before.
@_date: 2013-07-08 02:26:27
I was wondering that myself. If the cops seize your computer with a BTC wallet, they are probably not allowed by law to touch the wallet and corrupt the evidence. The wallet will just sit there in the evidence room until some expert is assigned to search and create a report of what he finds.
If there is a backup of the wallet ANYWHERE on the internet, this backup can be used to move the coins before authorities have a chance to cash them for US$.
This just goes to show how BTC may in fact be relatively BETTER as a currency in some aspects than gold or any piece of paper. As it stands today, law enforcement would need new legislation to allow them to temper with the evidence and move bitcoins to a government controlled wallet as soon as the hardware is seized. Even that might prove useless if the thief is prepared to move the coins remotely as soon as he is compromised (either by someone he trusts or automated scripts).
