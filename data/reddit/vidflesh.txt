That joke wasn’t funny; it was cheap. Not saying he shouldn’t have said it, but he should have gotten called out for it.
The Good ol boys club is due some air.

You seem like you feel like your world is getting small and that scares you. I understand that, not the same way you do, but in my own way.  You can say what you want, but someone can say it’s a stale joke too.
Oh shit or did I miss the sarcasm or something

I’m no expert, but I would think rap is much more diverse than to be surmised by the 90s term “gangster.” Tyler the Creator” “Kendrick Lamar” “Lil Dicky” to name a few.  Last time I checked welfare wasn’t only benefitting rappers. I mean, I’m black, and yeah I rap in the shower sometimes, but I hold a job pretty good. Come to think of it, I don’t even think I’ve heard the praises of welfare in rap since “First of the Month” by Bone Thugs and Harmony; was 1999. When it comes to anti-family, when I look around my neighborhood, I see a community with loving fathers and mothers, and loving single mothers that work twice as hard to show double love. You seem like someone who never listened to a rap song without the instant level of disgust that clouded your ears.
Our modern popstars are rappers there is no doubt. When they rap about bitcoin in the future, that’s how we know we made it.

If someone wanted to really understand bitcoin, possibly enough to become a core developer, what would they have lo learn? (And Im talking from scratch knowledge here.)

Well yes of course it is also a term of endearment among black people. But implementing a quick look at his twitter, Flocka uses it in another use case, which is not what black people have adopted it to be, but what that phrase has been constructed to mean since its inception by and oppressor.

Was replying to u/mackasfour and his reference to Flockas twitter posts about “minorities” 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:08:46
I sent them an email today about this. I am assuming this is in response to mine exclusively.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:51
Well nothing exists on its own, not even the word itself. And I’m saying that the way Flocka uses it in most his posts is non-endearing, and 
u/mackasfour  thinking that nigga and minority are simple synonyms is wrong. Because I’m black and I call white people nigga if they are being one. But that’s my own personal attack on the word and trying to detach it from black history alone, for the fact that doing so would break the word, broaden it, and relieve black people from the burden and undue responsibility of carrying the history of the word alone.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:23:39
Flocka never mentioned minorities in his post, he mentions niggas, 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:16:37
If you are referring to the use of Nigga, I hope I’m not bursting your bubble when I say that anybody can be a nigga, even white people. Nigga is a state of mind, either existing  in the accuser or the accusee. Adopting the term minority makes you a nigga in my mind.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:33:11
For that redditor to equate Nigga with minority I think is false.

Caring of cultural good-taste can be perceived as being a follower and having a lack of will.
