Although all of the comments are "YES" I believe that "NO" or at least "not really". 
Lets say the government has one big wallet that it uses to pay suppliers. It wont use funds from each receiving address to pay each supplier.. QT or what ever software they will use will take funds from (probably) several receiving addresses and pay the supplier. Most chances are that your taxes will be used to pay some obscure random supplier. Same as "hey.. this dollar bill was last time held by the grocery store across the street"... imho not very interesting.
A democratic tax system where you decide where your $ goes can probably be done with blockchain / "programmable blockchain" but that is one economics/social experiment which is a bit scary to try :)

ELI5: if i send BTC i expose my addresses. so i am stealth when receiving but not stealth when sending? i wont know starbucks's balance but the barista will know mine?

the main reason imho is due to fees.
if the average minimal fee today is 0.0001 - 0.0005 BTC than at current prices the fee is 5-25cents. that is a lot of "fee" for micropayments. 
you need fees so miners would include your transaction. why so high? ask the dev team...
