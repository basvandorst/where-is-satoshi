I like this, thanks. Don't forget you can also customize the data directory of each wallet by simply creating a shortcut of the %coin%-qt.exe file, going to properties &gt; target, and appending "-datadir=D:\Wallets\%location%" without quotes and where the location and drive itself is anything you want it to be. I like doing this with all of my wallets because my C: drive is a smaller SSD, so I can set my directories to a location on my RAID5. Then of course, always make sure to encrypt your .dat files when you're backing them up somewhere else. Also, never stick with just one medium for backups. I like to use 2 flash drives in 2 different locations and Google Drive. Since I'm using a very strong password I'm not too concerned with it being on their servers.

I've got full rigs as well as parts for upgrading. This includes 7950's, a 7970, and R9 280x's. PM me if you're interested in working something out and I can give you a parts list and more details.

I always use [Truecrypt]( with either AES or AES-Twofish-Serpet which you can read about [here]( Test it first with a Word document or something first if you've never done it before, and make sure to use a strong password...something you've never used on any other accounts. I also can't recommend [Password Safe]( enough. It's great for keeping your passwords organized, and they're all encrypted as well by another master password. This way, all you have to do is remember 1 password for the Password Safe, then you can store all of your other ridiculously long passwords within that (especially useful for random crypto exchange accounts and saving the encryption passwords for each wallet you might be creating, which would then be within this encrypted volume you've created with Truecrypt).  Let me know if any of this doesn't make sense and I'd be glad to try and help!

Not sure what I did to mess up the link...but here it is

You really should be using an exchange rather than a broker if this is your complaint

Interesting....like I said, it was $9 + $5 for me and I'm on the east coast.
One person's post there was funny - "Awesome project but are the shipping costs their business model?" Hopefully they can find a more efficient way to make this international.

Very cool to see more meetups spurring up in our region. If anyone is interested and living a bit further north west, we have meetups in Asheville about once a month - @_date: 2015-05-07 18:05:29
Ah ok, that makes sense. I live in the states shipping was $5 for me to back it, so $14 total.
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:52:01
Where did you get $25 shipping? It's $5 on the Kickstarter page

I might be confused by your wording...but yes I can confirm that I sent the bitcoins back to the address (CampBX, 1PptzuZXBs2QApiMWEFfhw6PiHa9fuHciT) I received coins from, which is why I immediately sent him a link to the blockchain transaction.
So then yes I'm out of luck? bummer. I can understand that from the broad picture if they received a bunch of requests like this everyday (which is very possible) they would never know who is just trying to use some good ole fashioned social engineering to get some free bitocins...I was just hoping that with all of the details I gave they would show me some love.
And yeah, I think the most aggravating part is the support guy sticking with these broad terms which really don't seem to mean anything outside of CampBX (TO address, FROM address, "Lost" bitcoins).
@_date: 2013-08-30 15:50:53
I sent bitcoins from my CampBX account to my android wallet. Then I sent them back to my CampBX account, before realizing that they had recycled this address back into their pool of addresses.

I no longer have the private key. I removed the wallet app from my phone and have also since updated the rom to Cyanogen 10.2 so I'm fairly certain there's no way to recover it.

I'm having the same issue. The small red message and subsequently added FAQ on the site was of no help as it seems to have happened after the fact. I'm still trying to find out when exactly this new policy was introducted. I've had a long, irritating interaction with their support (weeks of waiting time just for responses).
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:55:55
You're right, I was being thick headed because of aggravation. I do see what you're saying about it being a shared address.
When you say "sign a message" what exactly do you mean? I no longer have the wallet that was on my phone (13QqqRCtRyD5JyFCVXjdRKokFStuGbf7iU deleted app from Android due to the non-truly random vulnerability when creating wallet) so maybe it's irrelevant at this point?
@_date: 2013-09-09 18:03:01
Same issue here...
@_date: 2013-08-30 17:19:06
I was hoping to quickly send them back to my CBX wallet before sending them to my personal wallet as it was the address I already had on my phone, but yes I try to only keep funds in an exchange account momentarily.
Thanks for clearing up the "FROM" terminology. I had never heard anyone refer to an address in this way before this support tech.
@_date: 2013-08-30 15:51:32
I agree, I'm the dummy here. I do understand the best practice it's just frustrating because I was hoping their support would...you know....support me.

I just want to go ahead and say thank you all for the replies. I know I was the one who made a mistake in this situation, and I am the only one to blame. 
Still, I do appreciate the feedback. I'm still prodding CampBX for a solution. I figured I was not the only one who has been in this situation before so maybe someone else can benefit from my experience (or lack there-of :p ).

All this talk of the government creating bitcoin and not a single peep on the cypherpunks movement, which often discussed virtual currencies and the need for them to be developed decades ago?
@_date: 2013-08-30 20:37:27
In most cases you are correct, but this address is an internal address used only by CampBX. They are the recipient.

It was actually 1.0001, I didn't realize the fee was so high with the bot usage or I would have sent it directly from my wallet :p
