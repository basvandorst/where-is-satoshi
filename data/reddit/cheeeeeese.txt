@_date: 2017-11-02 11:04:00
im just pissed i couldnt buy in quick enough. now it just feels over inflated, too risky
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:47:58
but this really nice bitcoin broker told me the price was only going to go up!!
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:51:12

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:09:09
the exchange i use was down.. so it didnt even matter for me
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:54
so is gemini, its probably just a controlled selloff, nothing to see here
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:08:45
i thought it was cool, whats not cool is the exchanges being down.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:24:00
but its way too much fun buying low and selling high
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:54:01
just in time for a correction!
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:09:20
then it drops to 1.1k and holds
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:51:52
not soon enough
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:35:44
im fucking disgusted, been trying to buy in at lows all week and it just keeps going up. enjoy the gains folks but i hate you all
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:10:35
We all know what happens next.
