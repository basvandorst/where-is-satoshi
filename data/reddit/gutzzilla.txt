He really was coming off as scammy, i had never even heard of Paxful until now. He specifically said "we flip it to companies and millionaires, in exchange such as bitcoin loans. Then they pay back in a higher amount." Is that the actual scam? Or is that a legit way of making money on paxful?

I really am, my only experience with crypto was buying litecoin at 300 and look how that turned out lol However, im always willing to learn and what that guy told me definitely got me curious.

Damn, i was expecting a huge "invest and HODL!" response lol You guys are right though, i feel like a conman perpetrating this idea that BTC will be worth 100k someday, especially to my mom who will never even understand the concept of blockchain. I shouldnt burden myself with the responsibility of losing that amount of cash, i just hate seeing it sit there idly by when theres so much potential for it. I think ill float the idea by her but make sure to inform her about the huge risk it could pose, thanks for the advice guys :)
