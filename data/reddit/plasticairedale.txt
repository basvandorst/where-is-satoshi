No credit cards, but bank transfers are available. Cash deposits are an option if you're in the US, though your mention of Euros probably means you're not.
 to mix your coins after.

So do you pay your parents back bitcoins each month for the electricity your using, or is he letting you keep all the coins?

I just get errors on startup of this app.
As soon as I start it up it looks like [this]( then it switches to [this]( while it beeps at me.
EDIT: 16 hours later: After a few restarts of the app I was able to get to work normally. I haven't the slightest clue as to why it was messed up initially.

I'll turn mine back on when they reach $25/BTC.

Well some people are stuck at work/school/out shopping/etc. And they don't have software to automatically switch to fallback pools. Or don't have remote access to their hardware to manually switch over. 
So their miners just sit empty and idle waiting for the pool to come back.

Looks great. What did you program it in? VS.net? using WinForms? WPF?
What do the two top right buttons do? I assume the one is exit. I suppose if there are mouse-overs explaining what they do in the actual design it will be fine. You may want to make it clearer if you are forgoing the normal min/max/close buttons.
No block count? I assume you aren't showing it because for future "normal" users they won't care if they have downloaded all blocks, but for more advanced users it would be nice. It would also be nice in this "advanced" mode if you retrieved the current block so you could say like "downloading 133556 of 134789" to know how up to date the wallet data is. 
It'd be cool if you could integrate namecoin too.

is it working anymore?
EDIT* its back up

I'm content with just Ziploc bagging mine I suppose. As long as you bubble wrap it a bit. Ideally it would be shipped in a box versus one of those envelopes with the bubble sides. Either way I will be curious as to the final packaging you go with. I'll be interested if you find a way to offer a better protected shipping option.
You may also want to wear gloves when you transfer the coins from the tube to the packages to keep from transferring any oils/fingerprints onto the coin.
P.S. you mentioned that you would PM the message to everyone, yet I never received a message. I am assuming you figured out that you couldn't get the case shipped to Europe, and never actually sent any PMs.

I'm interested in one, shipped to the US.
Thanks for organizing this. 
When should I send in the payment? A quick look at the address you posted shows no BTC at the moment so I assume no one is sending money yet.

You probably could make some profit if you did it on webcam, people are into all sorts of things.

Congrats on the new partnership!
@_date: 2013-06-28 12:45:13
Will do. I'm at work currently so I don't have access to coins that I can sign. I'll send them out when I get home (about 8 hours from now), hopefully that is okay.

1. They are 1oz silver so in addition to the value of Bitcoin, they also have value based on how much silver trades at.
2. They are from a known respected person/company so no one needs to worry about being scammed (well you should never trust anyone on the internet 100%, but this is pretty close).
3. They look cool.

My experience has been fun. Been involved in every pool since last march madness. 
I even won a week in the NFL pool this year. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 18:57:52
Did you do the normal shipping, or did you upgrade to express or whatever it was called?
How long did it take to get to you?
Just wondering as mine is sitting in 'Production' at the moment and I am trying to get an estimate on shipping times, for when it finally ships.

What's wrong with the btc-e api that you just hardcoded the litecoin price?
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:22:57
Depends on the person I suppose. The first edition of these coins sell for 10-25 BTC on eBay currently (granted they are ~~10 BTC~~ 1 BTC coins). But that is no guarantee these would see similar gains.  
EDIT: first edition only had 1 BTC on them.
 
@_date: 2013-06-28 14:10:11
Nope. You would be paying about a bitcoin more than face value plus melt.

ASICMiner turned off some of their rigs (about 15 THs).
I don't know why.
@_date: 2013-02-26 03:41:13
I have been using it for years now and it's never failed to my knowledge. I even have had to block an email address or two and the service has never forwarded them to me after. 
I don't know that I would use an alias account for super important sites. But for signing up for random services I never hesitate to use it. If only just to track who is selling their email lists. And second to turn off the account once they start getting spammed.

I already had the coinbase app, but it didn't show an update. I just went and manually downloaded and now I have two apps that say coinbase. Can I safely delete the "old" app?  I feel like I missed something. 
@_date: 2013-07-25 15:28:03
:)   Looks good.
Just wanted to make sure that  wasn't supplying bogus data every now and or something.

Nice!

BitMadness has Pick'em and Survior pools. Free to join:
I've played with them for a couple years now.

Well if everyone is doing it, why not. You are a nice person.
