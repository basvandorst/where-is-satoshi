Yeah, I think that's one of my problems, there's really very few people interested or aware in Mexico and specially my city, I hope it can get some traction.

Not really, but I'll check it out, thanks.

Wow, I didn't know that, I suppose this happened because of a bug at the early stages of minning software development.
I also thought there might be another explanation to my question, perhaps the number there only contemplates the currently spendable UTXOs, so it's not counting the last 100 coinbase transactions, which include fees and therefore are not equal to the 12.5 minning reward.

Thanks man, those are great recommendations, perhaps the first point is the one I will struggle with, but I think it'll be great if possible.

How can the Total Bitcoins amount have more than 1 decimal place if the block reward has always been 12.5, 25 and 50?
Does this mean that at some point a miner didn't claim its full reward?
Or is this number somehow discounting some UTXOs that are thought to be unrecoverable?

I don't get your thinking, in which way would the hash help you? If a leak happens, wouldn't you be able to know it is you just by looking at the picture?

Ok, I see the possible use case, however, It's not a benefit for you, is it? in any case it could be a help to the binance investigation team, but your information would be public anyway.

A consecuence of that fact that many people may not have realized yet, is that half of all the Bitcoins were mined during the first 4 years.

A paper wallet should only be considered if you plan on hodling your bitcoin for a long time so you don't want to spend money in a hatdware wallet right now, if that is the case, the best choice is generating a BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase and export the XPUB into 2 different wallets so you can monitor your balance and generate new receiving addresses whenever you want, the 2 devices would give you security that none has been corrupted and giving you the wrong address, please feel free to pm me if you'd like more details on this method
