What are you talking about? For me it's working fine :-)
@_date: 2019-06-25 20:05:18
Yeah, I noticed that just a few moments ago as well and contacted my host immediately! Glad that it's working as it should again :-)

sure, I am confident that it is the most anonymous and secure coin on the market right now. the problem is that anonymity is a mouse and cat game, that constantly evolves. the problem with blockchain technology, however is, that it is engraved in stove forever.
so, once this security gets broken (and time is on the site of the attacker) the information gets revealed.
i am not trying to bash monero, i am just trying to warn any people not to disobey the law, just because they think monero is 100% anonymous and will be like that forever

there is also a difference between criminals who must hide their bitcoin purchases and normal people who don't have to fear the government sending them to jail
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:53:21
sure, but you know that big governments force their will upon weaker governments
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:20:08
exactly! it's always a cat and mouse game. (better not try at all, than be sorry afterwards)
@_date: 2019-04-11 16:17:26
of course, but one never knows ;-)

then go live in a shithole country and see how your life will look like if there is no government, SNOWFLAKE

haha, have fun in jail. the irs will catch you faster than you can say "what happened" ;-)
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:18:01
nice try, but as you can read in this post ( there are some security concerns there too ;-)
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:42:48
since there is a lot of money (Bitcoin, Monero etc) to be gained by the US government by catching all the illegal activity concerning Cryptocurrencies, I guess a ton! It will basically be a goldmine for the government

At least I am an Apple Sheep! :-)

The US Dollar will never become a store of value. Change my mind.
