Not entirely sure why that is, but if you pay with FIAT you can pay with physical cash. Physical payment is not feasible with crypto (yet), so it is considered digital.

Not saying you're the enemy, but I think you're stressing the 'digital' too much. But FIAT is digital, yes, but also centralized. Run by governments. Bitcoin is not. Bitcoin is innovative - not because it is digital, but because it is decentralized and not backed by a government.
Another thing is that crypto currency is not exactly 'immune' to inflation. While we are used to things in our current world costing more and more 'units' of our currency due to inflation, things in a bitcoin world will cost less and less 'units' (eg. bitcoins)... At least when the supply of crypto is fixed and no more coins will be mined. From what I understand, you'll have a deflationary economy (when the economy grows) rather than inflationary, which is not necessarily less problematic. See [deflationary spiral](

You're right. If you buy low and sell high, you make money. But it might not be the best strategy. Can you consistently identify tops and bottoms?
Let's say you buy at $10.000. You sell at $11.000 for a 10% profit. But prices keep rising. After a week prices are $15.000. Are you gonna wait for prices to come down again? You don't want to buy ATH, so you wait for it to come down to $14.000 which takes another week. You buy at $14.000, but prices keeps falling to $12.000.
If you had kept your initial investment, you would be up 20% at $12.000, but you're currently down. You HAVE to wait for price to hit $14.000 again to have made 10% in total. Another week passes and price hits $14.000... you could have made 40% with HODL strategy but you're stuck at 10%.
Still, there is no guarantee the price will rise after you buy at any time.

You're buying it from another person whose bitcoin is already stored in the exchange wallet. So no transaction needed until you send the bitcoin out of the exchange (and pay them a fee for doing so).
