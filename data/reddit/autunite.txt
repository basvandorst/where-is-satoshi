United nuclear had high level ore for a long time, its often sold out though. You can also get yellow cake.

Not sure what you are trying to say about uranium ore, you can get that and DU, and other forms of uranium online legally (US) without pretty easily.

Just rechecked. Dammit why did all the good stuff disappear when I turned 18 + made enough money to buy them. Maybe ebay still has some Autunite.

Posting just makes it worse. I made my coins by mining as a fun experiment. And as tempting as it was to sell them I am going to hold onto them even after any further crashes. I have no reason to sell them (if it really crashes I'll probably actually buy some for shits and giggles.).

I will call them embits

Same, but I needed the money. I was happy I bought in at 70

Oh god I know the feeling.

Awesome. What do I change in the script so it shows USD?

Actually some of us at cal poly are already working on guidance systems for our suborbital rocket. I bet with a little modification the smaller rockets of the 'high power' rockets could be used to attack drones.

How is that supposed to work? Being able to look at a lot of different items at once is one of the advantages of a market hub.
@_date: 2013-08-17 09:43:17
good. I keep it updated

Ok, would be cool. A giant bitcoin marketplace would be awesome.
@_date: 2013-07-04 02:35:22
Oh hell yes. I would totally send in some bitcoins if they would accept it. It would be fast and easy for me, just a couple of clicks.
@_date: 2013-07-10 21:11:58
Heh, I would cook my dorm room with my two gpu's that I would use to mine when not playing games.
