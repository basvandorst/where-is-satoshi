You do understand why OP created a burner account though, right?
@_date: 2018-09-22 22:22:51
Did you just learn about immutability?
@_date: 2018-09-22 22:23:14
This is a poorly informed post.

couldn't expect less from OP

it should in theory hold its value and be possible to liquidate if you needed extra cash.  Not saying it's a great investment, but a reason.  Isn't that what pimps do?

Separate cryptocurrencies from blockchain projects is what she said, and she had a point, but he explained that he hasn't seen a blockchain without a cryptocurrency functioning in the real world.
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:01:34
guess you didn't watch that full video.
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:33:11
LOL, with the ad hominem attacks still.

@_date: 2018-06-26 02:05:07
Did you listen to why he said he's favoring bitcoin?  He said it has the mindshare, and around the world you can exchange fiat to bitcoin, unlike other coins.
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:38:28
spoken like a true EOS bagholder
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:09:06
I stated what was said in the video in the OP.

Maybe work on your comprehension of what news anchors are saying before posing a nonsensical question.
@_date: 2018-06-26 02:24:03
Again, I was only clarifying what was said in the video.
You can throw out more ad hominem attacks, or you can impart some of your wisdom onto the rest of us about how these distributed database systems you speak of are equal to blockchain technology.

immutable, distributed, and technically doesn't need specialized hardware, where a serious RDBMS might.
