Click on the chapter files, and you'll be at e.g.  where you can read it. Or you can go to the link at the top of the page and buy the pdf from that site…

Hey OP, curious, how did you end up with so many and withstood the urge to sell before now? Great idea in any case, commendable!
@_date: 2019-11-21 13:58:49
You're right.

Yes but the difference is that you are the owner of this new address, so it doesn't matter, except for fees.
Also, it would be really weird that someone replays a transaction they don't benefit from?

What I don't understand is how the transaction can be replayed on the other fork to another address.
If I hold the wallet prior to the fork, and then I transfer the coins to an exchange, I sign that transaction with the wallet private key, so replaying to another address is impossible, no?
EDIT: oh duh, the address is the same on both sides of the fork…

oh, wow… I was assuming that since they forked, 2X and regular BTC nodes would not be communicating with each other. Especially since the transactions would be invalid most of the time…
So the trick is to use a low fee that will most likely be picked up first in one fork, and then once that is confirmed, use a higher fee on a different transaction to the third party you want to pay? Since the original address will be depleted in one fork, it will be invalid?
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:07:31
Oh wow. So 2X needs about 10-20% of miners to switch to even be remotely viable, and more like 40%.

n00b here: how would this transaction replay problem work?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:38:09
Actually, you only need to do this on one side of the fork.
When you're about to spend pre-fork coins, you should first send them to yourself on the other side(s) of the fork.
Then you can send them to your desired destination.

So - this brings up an interesting problem: Suppose you are a gov't organization, and you want to hold coins, how do you protect the wallet so that none of the people in the org can leak the private key and drain it anonymously?

Try finding the exact same drive and swap out the controller board.

n00b questions:
Suppose 1% of mining power decides to give 2X a try for a bit. That would mean a block every 1000 minutes, right? So 16 hours, or about 43 blocks in a month.
Won't the difficulty rules auto-adjust to make mining speedy again? So then &gt;100 blocks could be achieved before the Dec deadline?

I bet that initial decision must make you feel very good right now. I recently found an old BTC wallet I had from 2014 and it 20x in value. Of course it was a play wallet and now I have about $2 :)

Aha that makes so much sense, thanks!
