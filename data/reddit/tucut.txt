Actually i looked pretty often at what LB was doing when BTC started dropping and its keeping their sales to a 10k average (dunno if im clear) bit when BTC recently got close to 10k, LB was the only platform who's prizes went down when all other trading platforms had were following BTCs course

I totally agree, do not invest into bitcoin if you hope making benefits... You still can place a bit of your money in it to be a part of the movement and maybe the future... Who knows

Yeah right ? What's the point in that ? I don't understand...

LBTC kept prizes very low when BTC went close to 20k and raised when BTC prizes felt down (keeping ~10k average) it recently made the same as it got close to 10k, when all  platforms were following BTCs raising, LBTCs prizes went down... Now that BTC is dropping, LBTCs prizes are still higher than avg (~9k rn and BTC at ~7k)

Always listen what the americans say and do the complete opposite, youll see its magic

Uninstall everything that gives you the price, buy a little bit more and wait until 2020, youll see, it will be magic ^^

Even if you get many different shadows ? I know you need powerful pcs to mine some but shadows are supposed to have monstruous power ^^
@_date: 2018-03-06 23:17:41
So youre saying that we could use those shadows to mine other cryptocurrencies (that would make some money) that we could convert into bitcoin or other ? You look like youre knowing what youre takling about and ill be glad to learn a bit more^^ do you think that in this way of mining it could make enough money to pay the shadows every month ? (im actually looking for a way to use the machinepower that a shadow has that i dont have at home to benefit in some way, so i thought about cryptos)
