If you have money coming into the channel (i.e. a salary -- so it's never depleted) then one transaction (channel opening) is enough!
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:37:09
Not really, they're not cashing out to fiat with such transactions. In fact, keeping more coins in the BTC ecosystem helps support the price.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:34:12
If you have payments made to you, then the channel doesn't need to be closed as long as it has a non-zero balance. e.g an exchange could top it up for (almost) free (as long as you give them fiat, of course).

SegWit effectively doubles the block size. 
Lightning allows an almost infinite number of transactions between open channels, but channels need to be opened on-chain, so the number of channels open -- and thus the number participants -- is limited by fees.
TL;DR SegWit is equivalent to a doubling of the block size and Lightning (enabled by SegWit) permits orders of magnitude more transactions on the network.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:50:21
It just amplifies the LN's capacity.

First of all, unless you were an early adopter and rolling in bitcoin, you'd be foolish to spend deflationary bitcoin in favor of devaluing fiat, but people like to imagine buying coffees with digital currencies.
AFAIK, you should only need to open one channel as the network should be sufficiently connected for you to find a route to any other Lightning user. You don't need to lock all of your bitcoin up, just enough to last a period of time depending on your spending habits. Ideally you'd want someone paying into your channel so that it's never depleted, otherwise you'd need to open another channel for the cost of an on-chain transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:21:40
What's amusing and ironic is that Bitmain has created a coin that requires no mining because it's mined almost exclusively by them. They may as well just sign each block and save lots of energy!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:14:53
Opening a Lightning channel will be an option in your wallet. You'll make a transaction from your wallet to open a channel and allocate a certain amount of bitcoin to it - you can then spend from it or receive through it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:01:27
Ingest. Learn to spell.
Companies such as Coinbase, Blockchain.com, and BitPay were behind the 2X failed coup.

Hopefully these companies will fail when better competition takes their market share.

SegWit is necessary for LN because it fixes the malleability problem. SegWit also increases the number of transactions in a block, but it's opt-in, so more companies, especially the big ones like Coinbase and Blockchain.com need to implement it to aid adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:02:13
No, a channel connects to the network and can be used to pay anyone else who's connected to the network by routing through other nodes. You only need to close the channel if you need to cash out your btc

Opening one lightning channel enables up to millions of transactions to move off chain. That's real scaling
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:46:03
* It should reduce on-chain fees because many transactions can now be carried out through the Lightning Network.
* It should encourage further SegWit adoption which will further reduce on-chain fees
* Lightning payment fees will be minuscule
* Trustless micropayments will become a thing
* Buying coffee instantly without worrying about slow confirmation times or double-spends will become a thing
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:12:28
LN is a much greater capacity upgrade that a block size increase. With SegWit you get a block size increase as a bonus in addition to LN. Segwit also makes it more expensive to spam.

You open a channel (send bitcoin to a special multisig address) with as much Bitcoin as you deem fit. Ideally you'd have a source of income denominated in bitcoin too (e.g. an employer), otherwise you will deplete your channel and have to open another one - think of a Lightning channel as your current account, and your balance on-chain as your savings account.

Well done, you've finally understood why Bitcoin's is in 5 digits
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:32:40
Yes, but opening and closing a channel will be relatively expensive as they're on-chain transactions. You're better off funding a channel with as much as you can to last you a while, or better still, enable someone (e.g. your employer) to fund your channel so it's never depleted. Apparently you can top up channels without having to close them, but I don't know how much that would cost - obviously less than opening a new one though.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:51:40
No, there'll always be demand for on-chain transactions (and on-chain transactions are needed to open/close Lightning channels). Nobody uses other coins that use SHA256 ASICs (e.g. BCash), so miners won't migrate to them.

microtransactions on-chain were only possible when no-one used Bitcoin -- with Lightning they will be. Lightning will handle any size transactions, it's just that it's best suited for frequent ones -- and they tend to be small.

Ver has billions in cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:22:15
People will open channels and conduct the majority of their (smallish) transactions through them. Even if fees stay the same for on-chain transactions, they'll be for larger amounts -- and as a percentage of the total volume transacted -- comparatively small.
If fees do rise with Lightning like you predict, then it's like saying, "nobody uses bitcoin, it's too expensive."
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:03:53

@_date: 2017-12-02 23:03:46
There are several wallets in development, e.g.  
Of course, as usage increases, the wallets will improve their UI and many other competitors will emerge.
See this article for a simplistic explanation of how Lightning will work: 
Unfortunately Lightning won't help with fiat to bitcoin transactions or vice versa.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:17:20
I'm not sure you understand Lightning.
People won't need to continually open and close channels - channels are bidirectional, so bitcoin can be received as well as sent -- they can leave them open indefinitely until their channel is depleted -- which it may never be -- or until they need to cash out their bitcoin for fiat.
No-one knows how many transactions can be moved onto Lightning - it all depends on how frequent they are -- but those parties that transact most will benefit most -- and so will the network, because these transactions will no longer be clogging up the mempool. I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that these benefits will be much greater than raising the block-size to 8MB (5 times what we have now with SegWit).
But Lightning is far from the end of scaling. Yes, the block-size can be increased eventually, but we also have [Schnorr signatures]( and [intermediate layers]( that will aid scaling.
And with all this we get to maintain Bitcoin's censorship resistance -- its greatest strength.
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:01:07

Come on. You know that they can't acquire all the Bitcoin, or any large proportion of it. As soon as they started accumulating, the price would rise dramatically, making it ever more expensive. That's self-defeating because it accomplishes exactly what I state in my title.
Bitcoin has value because it's decentralized - if 75% of the hashing power is manufactured by one company, and that company is in China where CEOs are routinely threatened, jailed, or coerced, then that's very dangerous.

But 75% of the hashrate is manufactured by one company. There is talk of Bitmain refusing to sell their equipment to customers who don't support their view. Furthermore, they have their own pools, and we don't know how much hashing power they really control. Is that healthy for decentralization?

As for security, it depends on how far you want to go. But here are some tips:
* Use Linux if possible and keep it updated.
* Use a dedicated PC if you're really paranoid
* Don't use any other Chrome plugins if possible (or avoid ones with few user reviews)
* Keep your recovery sheet safe from water, fire, and prying eyes

The first number is the number of blocks desired for a confirmation. On average, each block will take 10 minutes to mine, so you can gauge how long you need to wait for a confirmation.

You have to time it right. Usually the weekends offer very cheap fees when chain activity is low. The miners moving from BCash to Bitcoin and back again has complicated matters, so fees are skyrocketing when they move their hash rate to BCash.
Change to a wallet that enables manual fee entry such as Electrum, and get used to noting the size of your transactions. The fee estimates in most wallets are ridiculously way off. Follow this bot on Twitter to find out what the costs are at given times : 
Also use RBF (there's an option in Electrum), so you can put in a low fee and see if it confirms - if you're waiting too long you can bump the fee to jump the queue if necessary.

It's obvious what Satoshi envisaged in his paper. It's just that you big-blockers cherry-pick passages like religious nuts, and twist the meaning to suit your agenda, which is usually to pump some shitcoin.
Legacy payment systems already existed when he developed Bitcoin and they continue work to this day. They're extremely cheap (if not free) and no on-chain scaling with a decentralized blockchain will come close to their efficiency. There was no need for Satoshi reinvent a less efficient version of PayPal, and he didn't. He created a bearer instrument that no government could take from you. Something much more profound.

@_date: 2017-11-01 14:08:59
It matters not. Miners are easily replaceable. All it takes is a PoW change and altcoin miners will flood back to mine bitcoin at $6000+ with their CPU/GPUs. The network will be secure and more decentralized once again.
Bitcoin is the most secure cryptocurrency because of its value, not because of its hash power. The hash power follows the price. If miners want to try and bring the system down by attacking it, they will lose everything.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:29:21
BCash was created for, and run for the benefit of Bitmain so they could continue to use covert ASICboost. They control 75% of the hash power, so you're trusting them not to censor transactions. In fact, ironically, since they own so much of the hash power, there's no need for wasting energy on mining, because they control it anyway!
Why would any miner mine that coin at a disadvantage, and why would Bitmain embrace competition anyway? It's an absurd situation, and as a result, BCash is worthless.

Off the top of my head:
* Potential to form the basis of a sound monetary system where damaging booms of malinvestment and the inevitable busts are eliminated
* In the meantime, it enables anyone to have access to a store of value akin to gold (but easier to buy, store and transact with, multi-signature custodianship) to protect against high inflation (e.g. Venezuela)
* Timestamping to prove an event took place (e.g. [Opentimestamps]( In fact there's a [long list]( of blockchain notarization use cases
* Prediction Markets (e.g. [Hivemind](
* One use case I was excited about was [Enigma]( However, homomorphic encryption, on which the Enigma project was based, was since shown to be [flawed]( I don't know if there's a way to fix it, but it would've been a valuable use case for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:40:55
Maybe, but I think it'll come much, much quicker than segwit adoption -- the demand is there. Not only that, from the various beta wallets demoed already, it just looks like so much fun to play with on a mobile device -- actual instant blockchain transactions that can be used in-store.

I don't think you can explicitly set fees from blockchain.info. It's best to control your private keys, because without them, the host website can restrict your access to your bitcoins on a whim.
People here are most likely using their own software wallets such as Samourai or Mycelium, or hardware wallets such as Ledger or Trezor.
If you accumulate any meaningful amount of bitcoin, a hardware wallet at around $100 is highly recommended.

I agree. Miner incentives are diametrically opposite to replacing PoW with PoStorage. But as we've seen with the abandonment of S2X, the users decide, not the miners. I don't think any sane user would be opposed to moving to a more environmentally favorable method of hashing -- if it was PROVEN to work.

@_date: 2017-11-10 12:59:35
Bitcoin will scale using payment channels such as the lightning network. That's far preferable to on-chain scaling, as it's obvious to see that it won't work.
Gold has few uses outside a store of value. Only 12% of that mined is used in industry. Its use as jewellery is as a store of wealth that is flaunted, because otherwise, gold-painted plastic would be worn instead.
Bitcoin, with its fixed supply emulates gold, and thus will always be a better savings vehicle that fiat.
Crytocurrencies that try to compete with Visa or Paypal without secondary or tertiary layers will always fail, because centralized systems are more efficient.
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:47:18
Blame the wallet developers then. Your high fee has little to do with the current Bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:41:36
Because it's a better store of value than gold. No-one will use a deflationary currency in preference to fiat, they will just hoard it.
A scientific mind is critical of ideas. Those that are not critical will end up getting scammed.
A 'better coin' will not be better if it's centralized, which it will be if a handful of data centers can serve blocks. You're just reinventing conventional money, but with hashing power wasting energy as it serves no purpose.

It will come when it's ready. Nobody will eat Bitcoin's lunch, because no other coin does anything better, and if it ever does, Bitcoin will adopt those features.  Other than for the dark web, why would someone buy digital tokens, with a hefty fee taken by the exchange and involves a lot of hassle just to buy coffee? They're buying either as a store of value, or for short-term speculation (see altcoins and ICOs).

The best strategy is to dollar-cost average - so buy small amounts over a long period. That way, you can minimize your chances of buying before a prolonged bear market, and can buy in the dips. Plus, buying is fun. If you spend all your budget in one go, your fun is over, and you'll just be worrying about the price falling and possibly regret buying at all.
It's very hard, but try to buy when everyone's selling!

Interesting, thank you. To reiterate, one of the fears of a contentious fork is the confusion caused by two (or more) Bitcoin implementations co-existing. If wallets could hide this from the average user, then a price fall would likely be less dramatic. Meanwhile, the economic majority and technologically savvy could sell their forked coins leaving one much stronger, but the aggregate price of "Bitcoin" would remain roughly the same. Presumably, wallets' UIs could make this process very easy to do, by matching buyers and sellers.

Could there be a cryptographic or software method whereby forked cryptocurrencies' private keys (providing they share the same genesis block and address format) can be held together in a wallet?

Exchanges or any other custodians only hold their users' funds, they cannot exchange them for the coin that they support, that would be outrageous (unless they stated this before the fork). Holders are believers in Bitcoin. Whether they believe in a decentralized coin, or one run by businesses beholden to governments, we shall see. Many new adopters don't know or don't care. As always, the price will be determined by the liquid coins.

Of course they're easily replaced. CPU and GPU altcoin miners would jump in to try and make some money if the PoW algorithm was changed. It has the added bonus of decentralizing mining, at least over the short term.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:58:56
Hey r/btc shill, you have BCash now, why don't you use it, no-one else is.
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:06:18
1) Yes, but if possible, keep the device in a safe place (i.e. don't let it leave the house, because you may lose it), use a password/PIN or pattern lock, turn all data/wifi off when you're not transacting. Keep a paper record of your master seed in a safe place where no-one can read it, but preferably in a different location in case of fire. 
2) Yes, but more accurately the master seed can create many private keys that you control and is known as an "HD wallet"
3) Eventually yes. Although probably best left until you have transferred your BTC to the Ledger hardware wallet.
4) Yes, as above. Ledger will provide an update for their software that will enable this. However, it can be confusing, so make sure you read their blog and their subreddit when the time comes to avoid making mistakes. 
5) The network is quiet at the moment, but for lowest fees, generally transact on weekends and use a fee estimator tool to find the optimal fee (this is my current favourite:  )
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:26:17
But don't forget that some miners mined BCash at a loss. Bitmain has an interest in BitGo who is developing btc1, so will gain influence in its direction if it succeeds. Ver also wants 2x to succeed over the legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-09-03 09:21:48
No! Immutable coffee transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:01:23
It'd be a corporate coin, with built-in KYC (Bloq, Coinbase, Blockchain.info, BitPay etc. controlling it). It would have no developers who believed in Bitcoin's value proposition, or have the required skill set.
Why would you want to hold a coin like that?
Remember that prices are set at the margin. Many coins on either side are tied up and cannot be easily liquidated, more so for companies. The futures markets have shown that very few people have any interest in buying the B2X coin.
If you think all the noise in favor of BCash, B2X, or big blocks, created here and on r/btc by Roger Ver's paid army of sock-puppets, and other altcoin-pumping trolls are representative of the wider Bitcoin community, then you're very much mistaken.

If people lose faith in a currency because it's comprised, then they will no longer hold it. Miners are replaceable, they don't mine out of the goodness of their hearts, the do it for profit. One downside of ASIC-mining is that mining has become a cartel, holding the Bitcoin economy to ransom. Hopefully we can revert that in time, otherwise current ASIC-miners will learn the hard way by suffering a PoW change and going bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:37:21
Haha. You're so desperate it's funny. You didn't find out about Bitcoin until the price was too high to sink your pocket money into it. Your'e so bitter that now you shill for altcoins in the hope of becoming rich.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:15:33
Holders decide, period. They sell the chain they don't believe in and its price decreases, they buy on the chain they prefer and its price increases.
Miners (as long as they're there for the profit and not part of an attack), will mine the coin with the highest value.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:11:52
Why so much love for the miners? With the BCash fork they have shown that they follow economic incentive and therefore can be bought. In fact it's worse than that, with the BCash fork, Bitmain and all its subsidiaries attacked Bitcoin, and you're letting them decide the direction of Bitcoin?

The problem is that Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. There's no point in spending it if it's holding its value better than fiat. It's more sensible to spend your fiat money first. If Satoshi had intended for Bitcoin to be spent like fiat he wouldn't have capped the coin limit at 21 million. All evidence (e.g. coining "mining") points to him modelling his system on gold.

They are dishonest. Looks at Bitmain with its covert ASICboost and and F2pool with its shenanigans.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:45:58
This is incorrect. [Jihan admitted]( that ASICboost was incorporated into their hardware and used on the testnet. Now, to waste space on a chip for ASICboost hardware, when the space could be used for regular hashing circuitry, and then not use it for commercial gain is utterly nonsensical. This is an industry that builds ICs for the only reason of making money. 
[Bitmain's pools]( also mine many more empty blocks (not selfishly mined blocks either) than other miners, which is indicative of covert ASICboost usage.
Then there's Bitmain's stiff opposition to SegWit as a soft fork (which breaks covert ASICboost), but it was [fine with a SegWit hard fork]( (that would permit covert ASICboost)
Of course, they then created BCash with no segwit and covert ASICboost as much as they want.
 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:58:45

Patent trolls could stifle Bitcoin development. Unfortunately, defensive patents are the only way to prevent them from doing so.

Very few of those on r/btc own any bitcoin. They're all teenage altcoin pumpers.

Miners are replaceable by users. I look forward to the day when PoW is changed.

I know marketing isn't everything, but when [Clitcoin]( has a more professional website than one that wants to nuture a $40 billion network, it makes you wonder.

What's the largest transaction you'd trust an SPV node with?
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:29:56
A hardware wallet. You can plug it in to your phone, or PC when needed and transact using an app. e.g. Mycelium, Greenaddress, Electrum
It's a shame the HW.1 isn't still available as that was even smaller.
By the way, you won't need that seed you created in Electrum, as the hardware wallet will have its own.
Keep the seed written down, and separate from your hardware wallet on your person, or at home.
There's more chance of you losing your seed than someone stealing it.

I didn't have the best experience with Revolut. Tried to use it on holiday and it didn't work. Then when I reached my spending limit for the year they insisted on ridiculous AML, so I destroyed my card.

Other applications can be built on top of Bitcoin. What Bitcoin needs to be is totally and utterly immutable. Mining centralization seems to be the biggest concern with regards to this currently, but I'm sure it can be overcome.
So yes, a store of value comes as a consequence of immutability.

Threat of PoW change is a good weapon to have. Unfortunately, I think that the miners still have an inflated sense of their importance.
Beware of gauging user support by Reddit opinion. The most prolific posters are paid by Ver, many others are altcoin pumpers who benefit financially from Bitcoin's demise. Of course, they troll post here too.

The PoW algorithm does not define a coin. Its users will decide its future direction, not a mining cartel, the CIA, the PBoC, or businesses that need it to change to fit their business model. If a cryptocurrency is not decentralized then all the mining done is a waste of energy. PayPal already exists, go use it.

Bitcoin has existed for 8.5 years. Wallets are still shit.

Excellent work Anton! I can't wait to try this out for real.

This wallet uses the test-net! 
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:26:37
Wallets are the problem. There's been little innovation in the way fees are handled. We're now 8 years into the Bitcoin experiment, yet people can't easily determine how large (in bytes) their transaction will be, and therefore how much it will cost.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:21:48
Companies may be put off from investing large sums into ASIC manufacturing if they're aware that the PoW algo can be changed at any time.

Does anyone have any tips to get the blockchain saved to an external USB drive when running Android 5.1? I think the crazy permissions are preventing it from running.

Ah, it's here that I should post.
Trying to get this working with Android 5.1.1 on a USB drive. I guess that it's the strict drive permissions of this Android version that are preventing it from running.
My disk is called udisk1, what path should I use in the .conf file, and do I have to do anything else?
