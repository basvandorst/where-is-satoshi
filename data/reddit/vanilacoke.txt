Its not any safer than cash, however if a bank like IndyMac no longer allows deposits and fails, the public's reaction is much the same. The thing is because bitcoin is decentralized, we dont have FDIC protection. Higher risk=higher reward I guess. Instead of being a jerk about it, how about expressing some sympathy for people who have their life savings or were planning on buying a wedding ring for their gf. Most people come here to grieve and all I see is you pointing your finger at us and yelling "I told u so" like a little 5 year old. Grow up, this isnt a joke, its real money thats gone.

Just start looking around. You don't have to be a economics major to get involved with the economy. I'm a psychology major going into medicine. I think of trading as a hobby, it's fun and you can make money. Start small, learn a little bit, then put in more time and effort till your making money. When I started I set a goal for myself. Using bitcoin as an example, I believe bitcoin will go up in2 years. Why? Because over the past 5 it's gone from nothing to a high of 1000 and back to 500. Bitcoin ATMs have just been placed across the world and the recent mt gox shutdown has been put in newspapers around the world. China is a heavily developing economy with a large new middle class with no place to put their money in. Do they invest in the communist controlled stock exchanges? No they turn to American investments. And what could be easier than bitcoin. In 6 months,  check back and ask yourself, why didn't the value go higher. Is it too high, do I need the cash now? Do you think they're will be growth. If you learn to ask urself the right questions and be honest with yourself ull make much more money than you thought possible. It also helps to bring in a friend or parent that you know is always honest, and won't lie to you to make your feel better. When you lose your money it's gona be a lot worse than just your feelings getting hurt

Ahah, I love this gif, glad to see it's being used in both r/bitcoin and r/dogecoin subreddits

Finally some good news in this crisis

1) Most likely not, I didnt even remember I had an account, I musta set it up back a long time back, when bitcoins were below $100, 2-3 years maybe?
2) No
3) Probally not, again, I havent used the site ever, for any purchases/sellings

This might just be because of an influx of people checking their accounts. I'm pretty sure this is not because of bitcoin's recent events. Im sure their servers are just overloaded with people checking their accounts

Alrite, so I invest in stocks, not just coins, I have about 40k in 5 companies, and your right, some people have been greedy. My general rule is if the stock doubles, sell 1/2 immediately, that way any money or rise in value is simple profit. However, many people don't know that, or are amateur investors.  How is trading on the news any different from owning a stock? We give it value based on what its worth, its growth, and potential. If people have faith in the coin, then leave them alone, and let the free market dictate its price. If you have no faith in its potential, then stick with what you know. Its the people that take the risk that reap the reward. Those that dont try will miss every shot they dont take. Those that do will sometimes score the game winning point

Is this the congressman that wrote a letter asking to get bitcoin banned? It's unbelievable how people would think banning something would actually slow the growth or use of a good. The moment government bans bitcoins, expect the wealthy and intelligent to hop on the bitcoin train.

I started back when I was 18. I asked my mother for a 5k loan. If I lost the money I'd have to pay her back, but if I made a profit I could keep 10%. So with the 5000 I bought Att, a internet serivice and telephone provider, because I knew that it was safe. Eventually as I got more comfortable, I moved on to banks, and high tech. I put in about 25k into Bank of America, Citibank, att, southern copper corporation, and Facebook. Today the stocks are worth 45k if I sold all of it today, so I basically almost doubled the investment. With currencies it's much more speculative, because there isn't a earning report or dividend u get at the end of every 3 months. I consider crypto-currencies to be a high risk, high reward venture. The bitcoin investment was from my own money that I worked many hours for. I would not risk my parents money on something that was so new. But I realized how important bitcoin can be. Can u imagine stores without having to employ cashiers and deal with money exposed out in the open.  Cash is already autonomous, why is bitcoin so different. Again, a lot of it is speculation. I prefer the boring charts and Price/Earning ratio but it's good to diversify and get a little bit of everything

Sure why not? If your coin gets more exposure to the coin i already own why not?

This isn't good, I have some bitcoins in my computer. I might move it to cold storage. It'd be interesting to see an antivirus company start developing security for bitcoins+ alt. currencies. There could be a lot of money to be made in crypto currency security

Yes I own a little bit of bitcoin and also some dogecoin. The doge is mainly from mining where as the bitcoin was a financial investment. I also have a scottrade account and have buying/selling stocks as an amateur investor for a while.

I would like some :)

Hopefully it'll settle. When it does I expect a bounce might higher than at its current price. The markets will stablize, people almost have already forgotten that bitcoin atms are rising in popularity and the 1st ones are already installed. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:52:19
Yeah same happened to me. Anyone know if anyone's financial information was compromised ? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:15:08
Buy low, sell high, protect your investment by putting it in cold storage. If your investment doubles, sell 1/2 so your guaranteed a profit even if the price drops. Do your homework and invest only what you are willing to risk

I dont get it, why arent we supporting dogecoin, I support bitcoin fully, yet I hear comments like "You should downvote them like the rest of us"
