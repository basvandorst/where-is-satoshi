Same. I think we just did the needful.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:15:30
What livechart are u using?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:28:42
Just go sell, man. I've nothing more to say. ��
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:25:28
Yep. I was thinking the same thing too. Although i'd rrally love yo hear what other people thought. I have the same sentiments. With the issue and problems btc have right now i just see no reason for it to reach another ath. But no one knows, right. I still believe in hodling my btc and also hodling my last bits of fiat just it case a &gt;40% drop happens.

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:03:55

Hi, on average, how much does a miner earn? This is mining right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:38:49
If it goes lower than 10k before the end of the year, panic buying os my only action plan.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:20:49
I hear children miners in china are cheaper than regular ones.

Beyond the moon smarts. ���� Great post.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:23:27
That's one way to get attention and downvoted to hell. Well, at least you got your attention.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:00:27
Don't sell or cashout. Your gains will be visible by 2018.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:06:58
I had no available money earlier when it dipped to 11. Fuck me.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:55:57
Well, when i read the post I was laughing, now after reading this i only feel sorry for him

@_date: 2017-12-23 18:25:06
I don't get your request. Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:11:39
What a delusional guy. Lmao. As if the break down of gold bars has ever been a problem for the consumers.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:03:42
The price seems to have stabilized at high 14 to 15 now. Any reason for it to drop lower or do you think it's gonna start climbing to another ath?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:10:50
Ok wow. Those are clear and concise explanations. I think i get it now. Yea, i only have like 500usd on coins.ph and based on what i read about transfer fees, i think i'm better off holding it right now.
Thank you so much for the help.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:02:36
1 btc is valued at almost 16k.
21million btc = 0
Value of everything is worth what humans agree its value is.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:15:14
Pls no. I wanna buy some more.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:31:49
Oh i hope it does go back to 11k. I just received a good amount of fiat and I'm gonna buy me some btc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:40:27
Thanks. Here is my Btc address. ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:35:22
In hindsight, yea. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:47
Have you tried this vision upgrade LASIK? I heard it's the shit for improving graphics.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:57:40
Oh, so it's still a wallet but not my personal one? I get the difference.
Other questions, 
how can i have a personal wallet that will be recognized by the blockchain.info correctly?
If i used the address above when someone sends btc to me, will i still receive it? 
Thanks. Sorry for the ultra noob questions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:29:23
And while it keeps on dipping, just buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:28:28

@_date: 2017-12-23 18:39:22
Damn. That I can't do. 
Gl to the modder. Enjoy that juicy btc from this moon dweller. :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:05:59
Yep. Same. I was only finally convinced to buy when it was at 19.5k though i bought at 16k. 
I wish i started sooner although brokeass me in 2016 won't have anything to spend either. Such is life.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:19:09
Okay. I'll wait. On to the moon, brother!

@_date: 2017-12-23 09:30:04
All about self benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:24:54
Yes. This is it guys! Go sell now! There's no recovering from this dip!
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:00:07

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:10:14
Let's just sell on it's next bounce. Then buy on the next fall. Then sell on the next bounce. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:19:39

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:04:18
If I still have cash to spare I'll buy some more. I'm a gambling type of man though, so dpn't take my word for it.
