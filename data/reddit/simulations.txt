It was once literally ruled a monopoly. They may not be today and I know their ideals and image seem to be moving, but at its core, in its DNA, Microsoft would be perfectly happy with making everything proprietarily locked to itself.

Bitcoin is a computer program that maintains a ledger of all bitcoins in existence across everyone's computer who runs the program.  If you run a bitcoin program, you can receive bitcoin (the currency) and send them to others.  The transactions themselves are all in the public, but don't have any indentifying information on them.  Bitcoins behaviors are restricted by the design of the bitcoin protocol, and can't be duplicated nor forged.  They can be traded for real world money in the same way commodities like bread can be - by finding someone willing to sell them to you for a cost.  That cost goes up and down like stocks and gold.

1. Moores law has to do with density of integrated circuits, not storage medium.
2. Moores law stopped being applicable around 2006, when it became physically impossible to make wires any smaller than they already were due to the laws of the universe.  Since then, we have been doing other tricks to improve performance, most notably aggressive caching, specialized cell processing, and multi core processors.

30 GB?  It was only 2 or 3 GB about a year ago.  By a pace of 10X size increase each year, we get to 300GB next year, 3 TB the year after that, 30 TB by 2018, and 300 TB by 2019.  The only thing preventing the blockchain from exploding in size like that is adoption rates slowing down and bitcoin being used less, which is not the goal of bitcoin. 
At 300 TB even assuming storage drops in half (1 TB / $20 or so) we're talking 6 grand to hold the blockchain.  60 grand (minus a little bit) a year after that.
Bitcoin has its limits.

Block size is 1 mb every 10 minutes, at most, right?  Lets say you get a copy of the block and send it to two people.  The total bandwidth used is 3 mb/10min, or 5k (40 kilobits) pet second.  That is *nothing*

I'm not saying that it's not a good risky buy for increasing your own money supply quickly, but, currency, investment medium, choose one.  It's not both.  When it's one it ruins the other.  And when something goes up fast, it can go down fast.  It will happen.  
There's going to be winners and losers on this, and the losers are effectively giving all their real assets to an exchange to be taken out by others, and there's not enough non Bitcoin assets to go around for all the people that think they are going to get paid.
Mark my words, within three months we will be seeing posts with a helpful reminder of what the suicide prevention hotline number is, as we have seen in the past.  Nothing's changed this time.  It's best to be cautious and not delude yourself on what Bitcoin might one day be, but be cognizant of what it is now and extrapolate patterns.  I've seen this pattern before and know how it pans out.  And at this point in the cycle theres always irrational optimism like yourself trying to convince bitcoin could one day be something that its not today.

I've heard all this right before the last crash in 2014.  When people start pulling money out of the exchanges and there is no cash to pay out the billions of dollars people think their magic internet currency is worth, you'll eat these words. 
Bitcoin is different... different in that it creates this cycle of boom / bust due to its unregulation and hysteria.
@_date: 2017-06-09 16:20:42
People have been predicting the end of everything for centuries before you.
How do you plan to spend your bitcoin when all of the infrastructure to support the internet no longer exists in your theoretical future dystopia?
As far as bitcoin being an instrument to spend money, it costs like a dollar to even transfer bitcoin today, and thats just today, how is that going to look extrapolated into ten years of 'growth'?
I've read the whitepapers, bought and sold bitcoin and have used the currency since 2012.  I'm not exactly naive.  All that bitcoin is is a public ledger of currency backed by the things you can trade it for, which is cash, and products.  Products which can't be easily purchased right now due to the high transaction costs, and cash which is limited to the amount of it being held in exchanges.
Whats going to happen is at some point there is going to be less people putting cash into exchanges as there is people taking cash out.  A sustained value loss of a few days is going to accelerate peoples skittishness, as they won't want to purchase a commodity that is lowering in value.  As the buyers evaporate, people will panic sell, and the price will correct itself and we're going to be down to the $1000 range again, or maybe even lower, who knows.  
Its happened like 4 times now and it will happen again.   Its always after ridiculous sustained upticks in value.  What happens now is people start using it less, because they are afraid of the loss of value that could happen if they put their $500 on the line to buy something that could drop to $250 just as fast as it rises to $1000.  Nothing substantial has changed in the nature of bitcoin since those last boom / bust cycles, so in my humble opinion, there is no reason to believe this time is any different.
At the end of the day, you can't pay the rent or taxes with bitcoin.  It would be nice if you could, but as of today, you can't.  And I don't think thats going to change as long as people consider bitcoin an investment medium instead of a currency.  You can't build a currency on massive deflation every week, its just not sustainable.

Do you understand how cryptographic signing works?  If not, you're just going to have to take my word that the math works out to do this:
A computer can generate a pair of extremely large seemingly random numbers which represents a private key and a public key that go together.  The public key can be used to encrypt a piece of data that can not be decrypted with the public key.  So if you have a public key, you can't decrypt another persons data that has been encrypted using the same public key.  Only the private key, which is held secret by the message recipient can decrypt it.  
Using this system, it is also possible to use the private key to generate a message that other people can verify was generated using the private key by comparing it to the public key.  This is called signing, and its the system that a video game consoles use to verify a game is legitimate - it compares the executable to the signature of the executable that ships with it, and if the signature wasn't produced by microsoft, then the console can assume the program was modified in some way or was otherwise not approved by microsoft to work on their hardware, and it refuses to run it.
So, in bitcoin, the bitcoin addresses are public keys, and the people that control those addresses have private keys for them.  When someone sends a bitcoin from their address to another, they are distributing a message that says "I can prove I am the owner of address X, here is a signed message stating I want to send bitcoins to this other address Y".  The nodes distribute this message and verify it's authenticity by comparing the signature to the public key, and if verified, mark the transaction as completed and update their own internal database of how much money is at what address.
A block contains all of the pending transactions the author of the block has determined are legitimate transactions.  If any other client doesn't agree, the block won't get retransmitted, so for the block authors sake, it must generate a block that follows the rules that the majority (all) of the rest of the nodes will accept, if they want to collect the block's fees and reward.

You don't have a main "wallet" perse, just authorization to spend money from multiple addresses. Sending alot of money to a particular destination may involve other wallets, but who is to say those are your wallets or your payment processor who happens to know the address, or random strangers on the internet.

Could be, and America could make a colony on Mars, and I could be a millionaire ceo, but today, it's none of those things nor is it guaranteed that Bitcoin will be the incarnation of currency that gets us to that point.  Hypotheticals are meaningless.

For every successful idea there is a million failing ideas.  And even in the successful ones, they aren't guaranteed to take over the entire market.  I work as a software developer and clients with money and ideas that don't pan out the way they planned are a dime a dozen.
Do you have neopets, or play runescape, or use fedora linux?  All of those things have been around for years, and there mere existence hasn't guaranteed a total takeover of their space.  As this relates to bitcoin, some people play card games, or warcraft, or use an ipad, due to properties of those games that their competition lacks.  In terms of bitcoin, bitcoin lacks the ability to be used instantaneously, transaction fee free, offline, like cash does.  It doesn't scale. It lacks the ability to maintain a stable valuation.  It can have competition from future superior cryptocurrency implementations.  These restrictions are real and at a certain point really restrict how far it can go.
Point is, all of what you describe is what it CAN be, but not what it is or necessarily will be.  And that makes this all a gamble.  And people lose lots of money from gambling.  Bitcoin will come down one day.  Its not what you think it is.  Its as much a currency as itunes giftcards is, but at least those hold their value.

This is almost indentical to my story as well.  Programmer at age 9, decided being good at math was worth it to make games, as a result got picked on, have sweet job as a programmer now.  The cycle is the same here, except its economics rather than programming.  Maybe we will both be expert investors with buttloads of property ten years from now!

Walls are irrelevant.  Bitcoin is exchanged on hundreds of other exchanges than MtgoxUSD, and the market evens itself out.
Walls are just investors with alot of bitcoin trying to cause a flury of buy/sell activity so when they drop the wall the price rises, and they can control the growth of the price at a reasonable level.  There is millions of coins people are holding onto that aren't on that chart, and that's much more worrysome than a 'wall'.
