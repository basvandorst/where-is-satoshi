I may not be a crypto expert, but I know enough to realize Bitcoin Cash is shit.

Bitcoin is just an option on the table I'm considering, they are flexible. No need to be a dick to me just because I'm asking some questions.

Okay? But this is what i'm talking about. I want to spend BTC on stuff right now, day to day, for food, groceries, bills, etc. I don't give a shit if it's going to be worth 1 Million dollars in some unspecific future where everyone uses Bitcoin. 
Everyone keeps saying stuff like this: "Just wait guys, 1M a coin any day now!" But where is the adoption coming from? 
I'm literally trying to see if it's viable to use as a day to day currency... you know... what it was designed for?

I saw that yesterday actually, but weirdly there are way more options than before. They have Amazon gift cards now, previously didnt.

I hope this doesn't come off as negative, but I have some legitimate questions about Bitcoin.
I'm currently debating debating a job where I get paid in BTC and I've been doing some research into what I can actually buy with BTC easily and it seems to be pretty limited in general. As far as I can tell, there are some smaller vendors that accept BTC, but other than that it's pretty much just converting it into gift cards or using Bitcoin ATMs with a huge fee. Like.... I get that everyone is excited about BTC as an investment or whatever, but I want to actually us it as currency for day to day transactions and it just.... doesn't seem good?
I guess I don't really understand the logic in it. Everyone wants the price of Bitcoin to go up, but what is driving this huge price increase if you struggle to even purchase basic things with it? Is Bitcoin supposed to be digital currency or just a store of value?
I mean, look at the sidebar of this subreddit. I immediately started looking for a list of vendors that accept Bitcoin but all of the info is focused on: Investing, Buying Bitcoin, Earning Money Mining, etc etc. 
I get that maybe it's just too early, which is fine, but there seems to be a bit of disconnect between the actual feasible use of BTC vs people just trying to get rich.
TLDR; I'm not a troll, not trying to criticize without reason. I don't care about bitcoin price, I want to use it as an actual currency.

That makes sense for sure, and forgive my noob questions I'm not as plugged in as I used to be. Is there any way to realistically use BTC for day-to-day purchases?
Is this something that will happen in the next year? 2 years? etc.

I looked into that, but it doesn't seem like there are any viable options in Canada unfortunately. There are a couple I've checked out but the fees are super super high. Apparently Shakepay had a good one but they discontinued it.

I totally understand that trolls come in here and try to stir shit up, but not everyone is an expert on this stuff. Sometimes people like me do have legit questions and can come off as naive/noob or whatever, but just looking for answers. I followed crypto a lot previously, but have been out of it for a while.

I gotcha, makes sense for now. And I appreciate everyone’s comments.
