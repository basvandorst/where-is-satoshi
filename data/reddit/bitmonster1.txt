* Servers will host the lightning software
* A user will send bitcoin to another user via an email-like address michaelwaterslide
* Bitcoin is exchanged by literally handing over the transaction data (not submitting it to the blockchain)
* Because the transactions are just being moved and swapped around its instant
* If someone is dishonest or the channel dies and your bitcoin gets locked, its returned to you after a number of days (see CLTV)
* Transactions can be cashed out any time by submitting them to the blockchain
* If a payee doesnt submit their transaction to the blockchain before the payment channel "expiry" they could lose the bitcoin

LEON STAFFORD from Bitlending club right? yeah me too.
I also lost an additional 3 or 4 to other BLC users and a further 12 btc to an outside loan

Lol, there is no fucking way this thing compares in any way to what google and tesla have built
Edit: watch the video
@_date: 2015-12-18 12:33:09
What are your thoughts on these magic beans I swapped for my cow today?
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:07:14
no, opposite. They are not banning it again
@_date: 2015-12-18 09:09:15
unbanning would imply that its already banned
@_date: 2015-12-05 20:04:15
multiple use-cases, some more weighted than others, its a general useful currency, non specific to a need. I dont think it matters which segment its more useful in right now. Interested to know but not so critical
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:46:15
Im beginning to see the value in these debit cards. I think its a case of adding stabilisers to the bike.. then removing the stabilsers later
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:17:50
exactly. what is and what will be is already priced in
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:37:45
many exchanges dont require this kind of information. Kraken for example limits you to around 5btc withdrawel per day with no information
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:03:42
I agree, I could be wrong but it feels like one of those ideas that will be superseded by something new and better. There is still a lot of time for the tipping play
@_date: 2015-12-10 23:31:55
haha genius comment
@_date: 2015-12-07 10:57:32
Why does that sounds so crazy? 
@_date: 2015-12-10 19:42:29
That does sounds suspicious to me
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:19:27
Centralised duplex micro-payment channels allowing the instant exchange of contracts backed by time-lock custodial return policy? :)
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:48:46
But then you are mixing your coins with others who want to get rid of their coins. The coins you receive could be worse
@_date: 2015-12-05 09:18:08
Ethereum's inflation model makes it a very bad currency, it can never compete on that level
@_date: 2015-12-08 20:24:59
Thats amazing, how do I go about reaching those kinds of volumes?
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:23:59
what a ridiculous comment. Are you mental?
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:08:19
@_date: 2015-12-08 21:06:21
Where can you get such a good exchange for gift cards?
@_date: 2015-12-29 14:21:35
likely lots of rounds will announced in Q1 to make 2016 look better. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 08:59:25
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:35:10
this is EXACTLY why you should get a trezor
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:54:24
How the the coins locked?

He'll be dead by dawn!
@_date: 2015-12-15 06:24:16
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:24:15
well done
@_date: 2015-12-17 19:11:37
5.5x correction due
@_date: 2015-12-31 18:21:34
By the sounds of things you have a good stash elsewhere. Better you learned with a small loss than a significant.
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:33:57
be patient grasshopper, the unfolded sometimes take a long path
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:18:22
Aka, June
@_date: 2015-12-05 08:46:52
I agree its very early to start calling ethereum useless
@_date: 2015-12-14 15:53:27
Some decent liquidity should be a good thing
@_date: 2015-12-06 09:04:07
I remember buying 3.2 bitcoins for about $2500 then another time my friend telling me I got a good deal at $770
@_date: 2015-12-05 18:01:13
If you look at the All time chart it does appear like a curve is forming.
@_date: 2015-12-24 11:50:15
@_date: 2015-12-05 17:34:44
good point, I guess as long as we are seeing rapid growth I'm not too concerned with the actual figure, both charts seem to be illustrating exponential adoption.
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:45:21
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:39:33
it sounds interesting, Ill check it out
@_date: 2015-12-01 16:42:00
Thats pretty funny. Looking back she looks like the idiot and hes the hero
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:54:58
Tomato maybe?
@_date: 2015-12-15 06:25:14
My current estimate for OP_CLTV and OP_CSV activation is around Q3 2016. I will shift my work towards implementing the changes proposed by Rusty Russel. [1] Changing the design of the channel is trivial, but there are many unresolved problems like routing that are open for discussion on the mailing list."
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:32:39
nom nom, have some click bate yummies!
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:21:53
You can close the channel at any point in time and your funds would be returned
@_date: 2015-12-11 12:21:22
Such a dick
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:45:52
Bitcoin is nothing like MySpace, you cant even change the background colours
@_date: 2015-12-15 08:01:16
You casually just remembered you had a drive containing $4,500,000?
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:21:22
will $400 hold.... 
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:25:09
When is the general release? I really want to use this.
Also do you know if they have KYC rules in place?
@_date: 2015-12-17 08:05:17
yeah me too, I took the process pretty seriously too, but there was always a few fuckers who played the long con
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:51:10
good point, we need 100 blockchains in order to scale to 100x more transactions
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:28:00
@_date: 2015-12-24 10:50:15
Sell all the things, buy all the bitcoins
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:40:48
@_date: 2015-12-15 12:22:50
its just a few lines of code™

Ive learned a lot in the last 12 months, its made me a much better investor. The truth is you cant see investments as people in that environment, they are just risk factors and part of the game
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:13:29
20 month old news
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:59:03
ok great and KYC?
@_date: 2016-01-07 09:32:47
until the comex goes bang
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:12:29
Agreed me too.
My tipping point was the idea that once you increase the blocksize you can never go back. Bitcoin as the settlement network doesnt need to function (today) as a 10k tps network. its allowed to be sluggish for now
And its fine to figure it out as we go along
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:46:36
At this point is better to just buy and leave mining to the big boys
@_date: 2016-01-15 08:11:15
Your lies might be able to pull the price back for a while. but it will do nothing to stop bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-06 18:56:20
haha I didnt mean you. I love my fellow geeks, just not sure id like to party with them
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:15:07
Im so excited at the thought of Coinbase/lightning integration. CB could absolutely smash it
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:01:46
The weather? you sound like the Fed! haha
Europe had the warmest winter in a long time so that doesnt sound right to me
@_date: 2016-01-08 07:50:59
he said it again! You're only making it worse for yourself!
Making it worse? how could it be worse? jehovah! jehovah!
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:07:07
Im in too
EDIT: actually, I just realised who will be attending
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:53:11
patenting a screen with some text on it?
@_date: 2016-01-02 10:17:16
Am I right in saying that everyone in this post has seen the movie?
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:15:21
Have you ever been to a bitcoin conference?
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:43:16
Love that shit, me too, irresponsibly ;)
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:54:35
haha amazing
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:44:10
Credit card gateways have the option to auth/capture any payment. If you dont capture the payment then the funds are returned to the customer. Why is this any different to a bitcoin payment processor deciding to disallow RBF payments?
Just dont use this option
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:52:32
When its at 10k ill buy a dedicated macbook pro to display the price
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:51:10
id buy one for real. create a kickstarter
@_date: 2016-01-09 12:16:51
* $600 on gox
* $35 on gaw
* 2,000 cryptsy points and 1000 dablloons on cryptsy
Gotta catch em all!
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:50:04
maybe you need to look at my bank balance and shut the fuck up
@_date: 2016-01-09 19:57:07
yeah, carry on thinking you know everything.
@_date: 2016-01-09 22:14:44
Its not ok to sneer at the guys here who have a few grand to their name. Its snobbery, elitism and this big-shot has all the advice in the world
@_date: 2016-01-07 17:49:45
ok thanks
PS: Hurry up ;)
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:43:19
You are very easily convinced by one man. Think for yourself
@_date: 2016-01-03 09:21:55
kickstarter that shit!
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:51:25
User growth deemed that to be a lie

I like McAfee, but in the last few years hes come up with some pretty whacky ideas and opinions. His meshnet for one.
@_date: 2016-01-06 21:28:37
haha im sure

oh god, do we really have to watch it climb back all that way again! haha .. painful!
@_date: 2016-01-07 14:52:32
Do we have a release date yet?
@_date: 2015-11-27 08:13:39
You must be a person who cant hold anothers attention. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:59:40
* Its complex and user-unfriendly for non-techies
* its hard to secure
* Non-reversible transactions can be disadvantageous when mistakes are made
* Price volatility can be stressful when storing large sums of money
* Its future is unknown
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:35:02
This time it's different! ;)
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:47:00
"I was really into the internet"
@_date: 2015-11-15 07:35:52
Nope, it runs Win 3.1 so its 16 bit, which they later found out was a huge flaw
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:04:55
sorry what? I wasnt listening ;)
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:08:13
As I understand it, some implementation store orphans in the block database. But I guess you know best. :)
@_date: 2015-10-30 07:09:18
I was talking to the guy who wrote NBitcoin and the book, he seems to think it does
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:47:39
ok, what I was getting at is the block database, which is what I am parsing. good to know orphans are present  in the files
@_date: 2015-10-29 12:13:20
thanks very much for the info, ill take a look :)
@_date: 2015-10-29 12:12:47
ah very nice, thanks. so two questions to help me figure out this issue
Does the blockchain contain orphans?
Can you point me to the code that puts the blocks in order?
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:49:34
what about 1% milk?
