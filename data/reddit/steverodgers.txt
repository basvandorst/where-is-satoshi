@_date: 2014-01-09 07:33:13
Well the reason I came to the conclusion is because the definition of double spending is where you spend money that does not exist. In order for this to happen in bitcoin, the blockchain would have to account for more than the actual amount of bitcoin that exists. 
I send 1 bitcoin to an address, but I double spend to another address with 1 bitcoin. 
The blockchain now records a second bitcoin that should not exist. This effectively means there are 2 bitcoins where there would have been 1. This increases the total number of bitcoins that can exist because the ledger now records an extra amount that did not exist before.

I currently sell fish and other goods for bitcoin. I'm honestly just waiting for Amazon to accept it, which would basically be the final thing. 
@_date: 2011-06-25 17:35:03
All people have to do is just start accepting it in businesses. I already accept it for people to buy fish from me, but this may not happen for another 30 years or so unless bitcoin calms down sometime soon. 
@_date: 2011-06-07 11:14:06
don't currently have a website yet, and I just started accepting it very recently, so nothing has happened yet. Purchases are not terribly frequent anyways, and most of the time the stuff is bought in bulk because I'm a farmer, not a retailer. So I'm just waiting pretty much for someone to say "Well hey! I have BTC!" and pay me in it. I also accept dollars, but as a business, I'm trying to support the virtual currency.
Really though I should correct myself. I usually sell in bulk, but I can sell individually, but most of my buyers are farmers and food companies, but I do sell to individuals, as I don't have a terribly huge operation just yet. 
@_date: 2011-06-07 02:12:32
You can just have people directly send their BTC to your wallet. I already do for my fish and farm goods. 
@_date: 2011-06-08 11:10:11
I say that you should be able to pick the servers your transactions deal with, and try to find a way to make that actually feasible to do. Maybe register with a program? Not sure, but basically it puts down that just because you control a lot of servers, doesn't mean you'll get anything out of it, and you may just end up killing your business if you fuck up.

I do. 
@_date: 2011-06-05 22:31:32
Welp, lets see where they try to go with this one guys. I KNEW they would be doing something like this. 
@_date: 2011-08-03 04:49:15
Well the problem with this market is that it's still young. It's not widely observed yet by the entire highly technical community. Most of the people doing what they are doing now are just clever enough to get it done. If you had a real IT guy working with one of these companies, there wouldn't be much of a problem, but now the gold rush is kinda over, so there isn't much point to get in. All there is left now is market consolidation where a slower process takes place where investors slowly come in to replace older companies to offer better services. The market will fix it's self. Also, you have to understand, if you know what it means to be a libertarian, as in to understand the underlying foundation which makes this ideology function, you must also recognize that any form of government which you cannot escape from is inevitably absolutely destructive and helpful to no one.
The only good form of government is one which can cease to exist without upholding the promise to protect your rights, property, lives, and contracts. What makes government worse is when it does more than those simple functions, and what makes a government do more than that is when it has the ability to jail it's populous for not paying for it. 
@_date: 2011-08-03 05:22:00
I didn't imply you said government should get into it, I was making a rebuttal to your statement about anarchism. 
But to go on about my argument for why bitcoin is still viable is that identity is not needed to protect you from theft. It's already clearly seen that theft occurs anonymously almost every time it happens. The thing that truly prevents theft on the other hand is a set of goods and services which increase the over all security of your situation. 
A few things to recognize:
*Yes, it does require identity in order to give someone your trust, but that is in the concern of the businesses at hand which sell you goods and services, and even though the names of the individuals who may own those businesses remain obfuscated, you cannot do large scale business without at least your business having an identity. You would not do large scale bitcoin banking or trading with an anonymous person, so therefore you require identity, and therefore a history to confirm or deny trust. Therefore businesses with an identity and history will happen on it's own, because they will require it to do large scale business. Identity happens on it's own, but just not with the individual, but that's ok because you are doing it with the business, and the individuals involved, not not purely the individual. You do business with the identity, therefore identity will pop up, and already has, and we know who does a good job and who doesn't, and therefore who to do business with and who not, and the collapse of your business is punishment enough for acting untrustworthy. 
*Personal accounts on one's own computer is also being handled. We already know there are Trojans out there specifically designed for bitcoin. But people will sell programs and form up services to prevent theft like that, because it will make them money to do so. 
Anything that is a need, or will be a need can be handled by clever people willing to work to make money, and the more people involved will also mean more specialization, and higher quality at lower cost. We all know this as free market individuals.
**The only thing that needs to happen now, to really solidify Bitcoin as a currency, is the willingness for our selves to pay for the services to protect and spend our money, at a reasonable price agreed upon by the customer and the business, which is already made possible by a lack of possibility in government intervention.**

My main questions for this are:
1. What is their management like?
1. What is their cash flow and sales like right now?
1. How are they getting their money, and where is their money going?
@_date: 2013-06-16 18:16:34
Actually no, you can make $200,000 a year set yourself up in an investment type of fund to get you well over $3,000 a month. That's enough for anyone to live frugal. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:06:04
Dollars are actually the most commonly exchanged US currency out there. Theoretically speaking, if you printed that on dollars, more people would be likely to see it by leaps and bounds. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 06:06:14
Thank you, 400,000 * 5 BTC = 2,000,000 BTC worth in stocks. Which means the company is "fairly" priced. I may see a bubble forming on the other hand. 
EDIT: Actually, before I fully commit to that line of thought, how many bitcoins are in reserve that are independent from the stocks, and how much of the hash rate of Bitcoin do they make up?
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:48:52
Right now in Argentina they trade Bitcoin by hand. They don't get their money to Mt Gox because they can't make international money transfers. I think Bitcoin is winning.

With this many comments, I'll never be seen, but why not make an algorithm that detects super small transactions (relative to the average transaction) in rapid succession in small increments in order to detect these bots, and then set a minimum trade amount for 5 hours (say not allowing any trades below 2 BTC for an arbitrary number) based on your own trading fee to where making transactions to manipulate the price just isn't profitable?
@_date: 2013-09-01 02:17:53
Thanks man, I wish I kept any bitcoins in my tip account to tip you with, but all of them are in an investment somewhere lol. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:28:15
So then how does verification of transactions have anything to do with hashing? From what I can observe it looks like the computer is guessing a number and is awarded bitcoins when it gets it right. But then if all a computer needs to do to get bitcoins is guess a number, why then bother to verify a transaction?
@_date: 2013-07-11 02:10:22

The thing I'm also concerned about is that at 5 BTC a share at 400,000 shares is still 2,000,000 BTC. You have to remember, that's a little over **9%** of all the bitcoins that'll ever be generated. I know that Visa or Mastercard does not have a market cap of &gt;9% of the entire USD. Those numbers aren't sustainable, and if they were, I fear for the entire bitcoin network as a whole.

One thing I wish he would have addressed is stock prices in a deflationary market. In a deflationary market stock prices go down as the liquidity of the company goes down with all it's physical resources. The investor doesn't actually lose money that way in a purely theoretical sense, but you have to factor in the fact that investors will have a much better time putting their money in a safe or giving out a physical loan instead of buying stocks. Bonds would do well but stocks are an important facet of the market, and from what I've seen allows for the fastest accumulation for capital, causing the most growth. 
Getting back to the fact that stock investors will only theoretically keep their money rather than lose it, if you look at the previous fact that you have a higher incentive to take your money out and put it in a safe, that also means stock prices will drop by selling out. Short term investments are totally possible in a deflationary economy, but long term value investing can't happen, and things will turn into a speculative market. Long term investments need to be possible. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:00:21

@_date: 2013-08-09 20:25:51
Because in order to steal the bitcoins, you could have to gain physical access of the SD card and put it into a machine to take them. The advantage over a paper wallet is that if someone simply has a picture of the private address, or somehow can copy or memorize the private address, then those bitcoins are compromised. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 01:48:10
Most people who mine are also tech savvy. Who would want to buy a used miner when the money they pay for it to mine with + electricity may not be enough to make any money?
@_date: 2013-04-19 04:08:08
That is up to the individual buyer, not the seller. Sometimes a purchase needs to be made that can only be done in pesos. Perhaps a person wants to buy a house in Argentina. Maybe a traveler in needs Argentine cash. Perhaps they need to pay some sort of tax. Neither I or any person on earth can guess the motivation for selling Bitcoin other than the seller seeing it as a beneficial trade for him/her. That's the best I or anyone can tell you about pretty much any trade. It's like asking why someone would buy BTC when it was at 260, but it happened anyways. 
Edit: Also some hope to buy up a lot of the cash while it's cheap so that when the currency stabilizes again, they'll have made a profit. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 23:58:11
As a value investor, I want to be able to look at this stock for *years*, not months, not weeks, not days, not even one year, I want to see how it would perform over the next 10 years.

What is the business plan of this company, and what are it's aspirations?

The negative reaction to criticism in this community is it's biggest fault. It makes it very difficult to determine what is real and fake in news, and can be very misleading and damaging to bitcoin. This needs to be rectified.

While cognitive bias against immaterial objects may be a problem, a problem that's even worse is trying to pitch a sale by making fun of the customer until they agree with you. Regardless of what you think is important or not, the elements that make up bitcoin are the very most beneficial to the poor, and the poor don't usually have a smartphone. Offline physical transactions need to be a thing whether you like it or not. Would you get angry if someone did actually find a way to do it in a secure and reliable way?
@_date: 2013-08-01 20:37:36

@_date: 2013-05-06 08:55:36
It's actually because the idea you mentioned as to bitcoin's "weakness" of being anti-deflationary is primarily a hypothesis and not a theory, and one that is just parroted out to society. It's not their misunderstanding of bitcoins, it's their misunderstanding of *money*. 
The fact of the matter is, you are always going to need gas in your car, you will always need steel, you will always need bricks, and you will always need carpet, and you will always need food. People will not starve to death for an investment because then the purpose of the investment is defeated. People will see the initial benefit but then face reality when their child needs to see a doctor. And you won't have the problem of only so many people being able to obtain a bitcoin either, because as sorrillo said, bitcoins are infinitely divisable. Heck, there's even possibility to "split the stock" of bitcoin. Making a possibility of 42 million possible bitcoins, but without actually hurting people in the process.

@_date: 2013-06-16 04:31:16
Actually, they are technically more divisible than by 10,000 times. That's controlled by the clients pretty much. Bitcoins are infinitely divisible because all they depend on is math. So even if 1 bitcoin was ever going to be mined, it would be enough. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:51:29
From my understanding, miners verify transactions using the block chain, and then update the block chain whenever they verify the transaction, making it irreversible. From what I gather, the wallet it's self doesn't actually store any physical bitcoins, it's just that your wallet is what allows you to access the block chain, and the block chain gives your unique wallet a value, which is how many bitcoins you have. 
My question is (if I'm not mistaken on how that process works), what stops a miner from falsifying a verification and recording in the block chain that the coins were just transferred to his/her wallet, and taking all the value associated with that wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:51:36

The point I attempt to bring up on the other hand is that there will be a line people will draw which will make people think the risk of difficulty rise will be too great to preorder something which will come to them in a long period of time from their purchase. By this time, an astronomical number of asic machines will already have been pre-ordered/purchased, and it is the point where no new asic machines are being sold, but the astronomical amount of asic machines which were ordered long ago are finally hitting the mining operation. That's when I think a great difficulty wall will occur.

Because people (including me) like to feel something tangible in their hands that is within their own physical power. You might not see the point of it, but that doesn't mean other people don't.

Oh okay, I thought the way people were talking about it was as if this were a problem with bitcoin it's self, not a service related to it. I like the idea of a client using a server that tracks everything for it, I imagined such a thing would eventually come and become the norm. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 03:05:53
You essentially know* the signature to public addresses that other people do not know, thus making you the only person who can access them. When you "own" a bitcoin, the blockchain simply says that 1 bitcoin is assigned to a specific address that only you know the signature required to sign them to a different one, making you the defacto owner of it via technocracy.

If you've noticed, most people have been valuing bitcoin at $100 even when it was at $64 again. The price was bound to go up. It wasn't the expectation that it'll go back up again, it's the fact that everyone valued bitcoin at $100 and considered it undervalued at $64. There is a difference between price anticipation and value perception.

Also with the position that company is in, losing 200 Bitcoins to a customer because you want tomake good customer support could end up being a +$50,000 just because your name has better clout.

How many shares are out there in total for ASICMINER?
@_date: 2013-06-13 21:08:15
What he means is that you need to have an actual reason to hold an investment, not just hoping it goes up. I'm holding because this currency has capabilities that no other fiat currencies currently have, I am not at the whim of any one person or organization with it, and as far as the infrastructure is set up for it, Bitcoin is essentially unassailable. It's also deflationary, and I can predict how man coins will be in circulation over time. So that's why I hold bitcoin, not because I hope it will go up. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 02:55:10
It is when you consider the reasons people are buying them. They are a loss in investment. Sales will go down because of that fact, causing this to be a bubble.

I'm only looking at hash rate and bitcoin yeilds that they make. I would add in their hardware profits at maybe 20% of their value. I am trying to look at whether or not ASICMINER as a company could function if everyone sold their shares at once, and how high the price would need to be in order to breach that limit.

it looks like everything gong on there is all based on bets. Investing is where a company offers you to take a risk for your money where in return they give you a profit on whatever you invested in. But investing is more complicated than that. Investing is where you also find ways to assure that you'll get your money back. Investing is where you use your money to cause *growth*. When I invest my money into Berkshire Hathaway Stock, I do it because they almost never dilute their stock, they invest in companies which are set up for permanent growth, and it's managed by a fucking genius. That's investing. This is betting. Betting is just putting your money in and hoping it goes up. Investing is planning the best use of your money to cause *growth*.
EDIT: now if that casino issued a quarterly report and offered to give a percentage of their profits to investors, that would be a pretty good investment because casinos are set up to always make money, but this set up is not such a case. This is betting.

You just have abusive parents. Mine have done the exact same thing to me. If they can't pay off their house or medical bills, they aren't great at money themselves. Don't show them anymore of what you do, and don't worry if they are proud of you or not. Just make your money and get out.

I have no idea how you draw that conclusion. If a company's manager has been bad for the last 10 years for instance, you can definitely feel free to assume that the manager will be bad for the next 10 years.

As an Austrian Economist, I think your assumptions about any company what so ever being too big to fail is fallacious. There very well may be something better than even Bitcoin to arise out of this which would benefit us all even better than what Bitcoin does currently. If a company fails, that is because it was not worthy of being in the market in the first place, and will be replaced by something better and more resiliant, learning from past mistakes.

What's the difference between this and a mining pool?
@_date: 2013-05-15 01:59:25
No, it's actually happening. It's just that this is an investigation involving money laundering. When these services are bigger and more able to isolate cases like this, they will, and it won't affect any users at all. Honestly we'll see dwolla working again for Mt. Gox in a few months when they're done collecting evidence. They haven't done anything against CampBX and that's an AMERICAN company. I wouldn't worry about it, and your service with gox should be just fine.

Not in testing stages yet, but I might give you a chance if I need it.

Well, considering the entire business is built around it aside from the sheer purchasing of mining equipment, people really should look at the BTC value instead of the USD value. Also, I don't even think the biggest wallet in the entire network has as many as 2,000,000 BTC in it. I don't think ASICMINER has the ability to pay off all that. ASICMINER is a great company, but right now it's shares are way over priced.

Statement Regarding Dwolla:
Like many who have contacted us, MtGox has read on the Internet that the United States Department of Homeland Security had a court order and/or warrant issued from the United States District Court in Maryland which it served upon the Dwolla mobile payment service with respect to accounts used for trading with MtGox. We take this information seriously. However, as of this time we have not been provided with a copy of the court order and/or warrant, and do not know its scope and/or the reasons for its issuance. MtGox is investigating and will provide further reports when additional information becomes known.

The fact that it's so unique is the main reason why I have been very careful in my trading habits with it. I have no idea what it will do, and so there is little data that will tell me whether or not it will keep going up or plummet. I've just been watching the busts and booms very closely and even though my rate of profit is slower than people who've kept their coins in, hindsight is 20/20, and I still can't tell what's going to happen.
Now that the Cypress Banking Freeze will be over today, I am interested to see what it will do to Bitcoin.

Honestly I wouldn't have posted here had I not first checked my transaction history and looked to see if I had an open sell order. To me it's not so much a point about whether or not it's a relatively small amount, it's the fact that I'm not being dealt with over something that was their fault.

Well colored coins may be the way that comes about actually. The BTC fractional reserves would just issue IOU's to people and smart property would assign your rights to those BTC.

Thanks dude, I'm not trying to be one of "those guys", it's just that I'm in a stressful point in my life right now and I'm trying to scramble to find a way to make money, and I happen to believe that bitcoins are actually "cheap" right now, compared to what I think it will be like in the future.

Yes but that would imply that enterprising credit card companies will come about to rival Visa an Mastercard. Regulations in the financial market make this feat next to impossible.

With this many comments, I'll never be seen, but why not make an algorithm that detects super small transactions (relative to the average transaction) in rapid succession in small increments in order to detect these bots, and then set a minimum trade amount for 5 hours (say not allowing any trades below 2 BTC for an arbitrary number) based on your own trading fee to where making transactions to manipulate the price just isn't profitable?

We have to find a way one way or another to send bitcoin without the immediate use of an electronic device. This may end up having to be done through a bank though.

I don't think anyone can predict the price of bitcoin. I'm just giving my value analysis on what I think it should be given the current conditions of bitcoin's environment. It worked, and I typically have a pretty good batting average about it too. I don't pay attention to only the price.
