If you're not familiar with any of Wilcock's work, he claims that there is an underground and undercover movement of factions within each agency that has sworn to protect and uphold the Constitution from foreign and **domestic** threats and that is ultimately opposed to the Illuminati families (Rothschilds et al) and their stake within the military industrial complex.
In this case, he claims that the NSA branch of this [Oathkeeper-like]( movement actually created Bitcoin under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto.

They did not qualify for 0 fees because they did not have a transaction priority above 57,600,000 according to the Bitcoin wiki transaction fee page [here](

This is why I recommend that people learn how to create and send raw transactions through the daemon if they're going to be handling large amounts of bitcoin. It's simple command line and you can even use it offline; the internet is only required to push a raw transaction and that can even be done from a compromised computer. You don't have to be a coding wizard to know how to do this.

What happens when you try to manually enter the address? This definitely sounds like malware, so I recommend Malwarebytes AND an anti-virus scan/clean.
When it comes to Bitcoin, I would personally just reformat the HD and install the OS again. I wouldn't trust a virus scanner to permanently get rid of the problem even if it appears to.
Once compromised... always compromised. Like Andreas always says, always assume your computer is infected as soon as it's connected to the internet.

That's what I said. I use GPA all the time. But this quote from fgumo: *"If you use PGP you need to donate. If you don't use it, you should start using it and also donate. This is one of the few projects that needs to be maintained no matter what."* is like saying, if you use e-mail, you need to donate to Hotmail. GnuPGP is not the only way to use PGP. There are other programs out there as well like Gpg4win.
To use that same example, Hotmail is only an e-mail provider, not the protocol itself. In the same way GnuPG and GPA is only an implementation of PGP, not the protocol itself.

I have never used Armory because creating and signing transactions can be done entirely offline in QT, but I would assume that it functions exactly the way JustAPinchOfVanilla says so. However, I don't see the need for Armory to be online to create a raw transaction if it has a fully synced blockchain, which can actually be imported from an online computer to an offline one using the -detachdb command in the bitcoin.conf file located in Bitcoin's AppData folder.

I do not like fast food. I think it's some of the unhealthiest food you can ever eat and is most likely reducing the life expectancy of anyone who buys them.
Do I waste my time posting about how bad McDonald's is or how bad KFC is for your health?
I hate golf. I think it's the stupidest "sport" on the planet and if you combine all of the acres from all the golf courses in the world and re-purposed them for agricultural reasons, we'd be able to feed many people in Africa.
Yet, I don't go online spouting negative comment after negative comment about golf.
I understand people's needs to express their opinions, but constantly posting negativity on a subject or creating an entire subreddit against anything is a ridiculous waste of time.
Even constant constructive criticism is a huge waste of time. You have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than getting someone on the internet to accept your ideologies about any given subject.
