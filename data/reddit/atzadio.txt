Well put, as.someone.who has never spent any bitcoin on anything I'd love to help facilitate the growth of a market fueled by crypto but unfortunately it's not a very simple process as I see it, that being said I haven't really looked into it that much, the fear is that you buy spend $50 on something worth $50 only to find tomorrow that you spent more like $200 on that $50 item. Does that make sense?

Believe it or not much of this bitcoin phenomenon is tied into lessons learned in classical antiquity. I still believe in Bitcoin as the premise for a global currency one day. Problem is with something that big you attract a lot of attention. People are willing to kill for money, so you can't be surprised when a bunch of vultures and wolves swarm to prey upon the meek and innocent. As with any currency its value is largely a function of confidence. At the moment a system capable of convincing people that invading third world countries and electing billionaires as heads of state are good ideas is using much of its collective strength to undermine confidence in cryptocurrencies. The worst part is the bots, trolls etc. Under the influence of people that want to see an innovative idea like bitcoin fail have the ability to vomit up uncertainty and skepticism on a mass scale. Personally I'm in this for the long term and hope peoples' faith in it can survive the outlandish media assault that is currently taking place.
