Onecoin is all a lie there is no coins u are just giving away your money to scammers and they are good so they make alot of fucking money, they talk good and stupid ppl believe it. The reason that they are not busted yet are cuz they sell "education packages" so basicly they sell education about a cryptocoin that dosent exist.

ok nice thx! yeah i have 8BTC on blockchain.info wallet :P thats maybe to much.
BTW i have a really old adress that i use all the time, i just noticed that blockchain.info dosent cover it with the phrase? probably cuz its really old? should i stop using that or can i figure out the phrase for that adress? Also is the phrase for all my adresses in the wallet, they are linked to my wallet? there is not a phrase for every adress right?

@_date: 2017-01-03 11:46:50
that 12 word stuff i have on my blockchain wallet does this mean i can access my BTC from any other wallet with that phrase? incase of blockchain goes down, how do i do that? What do i need for information? my key? my phrase? my password? or just phrase?
