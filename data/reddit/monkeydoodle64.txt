Sounds clever but this art concept doesnt make sense. First, blockchain is not equal to bitcoin. Blockchain is just 1 technology used by bitcoin. Second, a black chain is supposed to mean blockchain? A BLACK CHAIN? Cmon dude, do i need to say what this reminds me off? Im getting pissed off now.

This is yuge. Only vets know. No matter how many times you explain how bitcoin is gonna reach 100k... ppl r gonna ignore it lol. Thats good for us. The more no one believes, the earlier in adoption we are... the riskier is more rewarding.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:43:11
End of 2021. Thats the point that op is trying to make. Bitcoin cycles every 4 years. I def agree and see the same pattern. Last time was end of 2017. Before that it was end of 2013. The halving is the main factor for timing the bitcoin winter. The big surge is caused by a combination of supply shock and FOMO. Past the ATH, people are gonna be like “YoU cOuLd HaVe BoUGhT bItCoiN AnY dAy AnD mAkE a PrOFiT”, guaranteed. Us ppl are sheeps. Smart ppl are gonna be like “Holy shit mayer multiple at 5??? SODL.”

If its not hitting 200k by the end of 2021, then pretty much for sure by 2025.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:04:55
Unless its bitcoin winter. Pretty much like harvesting, accumulating bitcoin is done with anticipation. When the bitcoin summer hits, and bitcoins are big and fat, gotta reap the gains, so you are financially prepared for the bitcoin winter AND you ll be able to reinvest the gains on the next cycle to harvest even more bitcoins. If you dont reap the gains, you can watch your crops die over 80%. I dont wanna go through that again.

You just open a channel in the LN which pretty much allocates a set amount of btc determined by you. Like you could open a channel with 0.01 bitcoin and use that to pay for coffee. When you want your bitcoin back, you close the channel and you get back whatever your final balance is. In order to open you gotta make some kind of transaction which requires you to pay a fee, depending how much you pay, the channel will take less time to open. Pretty much the same thing as making a normal bitcoin transaction. Once you are using the open channel, LN transactions are OFF the chain and are pretty much instantaneous and free!

Nah ideally you dont hodl when its crashing like last year. But now we are on a different market. You wanna sell before the bubble pops HARD. We are just getting small corrections cause bitcoin is moving up too fast. Later its just gonna be on fire, and really moon.  Thats when u gotta start to think of selling. But later as in 2 years later. Invest for the long term and dont stress on the short term. Its impossible to predict the short term moves and the chances to miss the upside are big. Check this video out.  It explains the 4 year cycle.

O yeah u can prob make a bitcoin payment from you coinbase wallet too. But thats kinda dumb cause then u ll have coinbase not only knowing when u buy and sell bitcoin but also when u make bitcoin purchases, for no real reason. They ll rat u out to irs as soon as they need to cover their own asses. That said, the coinbase concerns are prob a bit overblown but who can blame the bitcoin community, we dont even trust government backed fiat so its not too far off nor surprising lol.
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:25:40

@_date: 2019-06-19 20:11:50
So all governments plot to censor bitcoin? The gov will hold on to everyones bitcoins and give fiat in return? I doubt that will ever happen. Maybe nationally but not globally. Your scenario sounds like something countries might have to go to war for to protect their rights.

I tried ln on android no problem with eclair wallet or bitcoin lightning wallet. It works great. However, on ios i couldnt find anything good. I didnt try bluewallet cause its custodial and they ve been compromised before. The only thing for ios was zap but it required to connect to a node so not good for grandma. There are also desktop solutions available but i think thats too complicated and stationary for grandma.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:10:47
Not sure about that. Ltc halving is coming up, so it has a chance to blow up to an ath earlier than btc...
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:45:49

Also when spending bitcoin, the rate gets locked in for a short time like an hour, so you know how much you ll be charged exactly without surprises. Op needs to do some more research. Maybe there is a funny joke in there still but the content in this meme aint funny fam.

@_date: 2019-06-11 17:20:33
Yes. Its pretty stable above 7.5k. Might dip to 4k who knows. But the upside is like 20-30k per btc next year. You only get the upside by hodling through thick and thin. Best advice must be DCA to avoid big loses.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:45:27
20k next year

It depends. If they r using a third party then most likely its converted on the spot. If they are using btcpay then they get the btc directly from the customer so its up to the business when/if to convert to fiat.

Bitcoin is evolving every year like the internet did. Its hard to imagine this level of foresight from the inventors. The good creations transcend beyond what the creator intended. As long as it has strong bones, a concept can last generations.
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:18:07
A lot of ppl are holding bitcoin hoping its a refuge to fiat, already. Like this guy u might heard of andreas antonopoulos. If a recession comes, all ppl with fiat will seek for refuge. Unless in your hypothetical financial downturn, bitcoin failed to be sound money somehow, then i dont see why someone would want to hold fiat over sound money during a recession.

Welcome to the fucking bitcoin show.
@_date: 2019-06-27 12:12:11
This is dumb.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:58:12
Finally some good content. Fuck.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:26:20
Yeah i get it. Me too. I just said that cause op said he would not lose much if it went down.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:27:36
So what. This aint facebook where you get to share your feelings...
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:41:03
Ive been holding since 2014 and i regret profoundly not selling near 20k. I was getting greedy on that lambo but i should have come back to earth and cashed out at least 50% of my bitcoins. Then i should have bought them back during the bitcoin winter. I should have known that a lambo takes time and capital to achieve. Greed makes you delusional. Anyways, ATH is around a year after halving and bitcoin winter lasts around a year after ATH. We are gonna have a bull market for the next 2 years right now... so HODL. HODL TIGHT. 
Tl;dr: Sell near ATH buy back after the crash.
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:54:21
Tl;dr: TA on bitcoin doesnt work.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:22:55
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:15:25
Its more of an ownership issue.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:04:01
@_date: 2019-06-06 01:36:51
That looks so gross wtf.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:15:42
U ll be fine. We r in a bull market.
@_date: 2019-06-03 19:48:03
Buy her a channel bag with bitcoin gains.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:57:20
Seriously. Public barely knows what bitcoin is. They dont know what halving is lol. No matter how many times is on the news.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:07:15
Its not impossible to turn 10k to a mil. Just gotta wait like 10 years.
@_date: 2019-06-14 05:58:02
Cause the dude looks funny af
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:57:08
Give it 2 years. HODL.
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:40:20
This was written in 2004 bro...
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:29:58
Imo it ll be like gold. A safe haven from inflation. Maybe even better cause governments cant manipulate the prices. So i think it ll go up. Especially if fiat currencies start to go down, why would a hodler exchange sound money for fiat?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:14:10
Great answer. And how has going long on dollar perception been working for you? Whats the difference with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:24:03
Why not use real money. Like 10 dollars. And play around with satoshis? Instead of playing with fake things.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:20:40
Use a software wallet, like green wallet on ios or samourai on android, to use for transactions. You can send funds from coinbase as you are comfortable handling with. Your coinbase wallet would be like your little vault. Software wallets are not the safest cause they are always connected online. Coinbase is not considered safe either cause you rely on them to hold your money for you. I used it for like years no problem but now i got a trezor hardware wallet where i keep my main btc funds. Hardware wallet is supposed to be one of the best ways to store bitcoin safely. Its cold storage so its not connected to the internet when stored. Anyways that should get u going. But yeah get used to having multiple wallets. A wallet can either be literally where you keep pocket change for small daily transactions, or you vault where you keep your savings. Stay open minded!
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:01:31
Bitcoin is a commodity tho. You can print currencies, but not commodities.
@_date: 2019-06-17 01:15:07
Lol because everyone can do the conversion from btc to btc. Thats just the app i didnt do that.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:19:59
Gotta compare 2017 with upcoming 2021 run.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:47:41
This is a good way to put it
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:31:54
So what.
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:19:05
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:00:10
Kim jung un, is that you?
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:45:52
I love that ppl like op are scared to buy. It means we r still not in fomo stage.
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:30:23
Its called being rich.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:38:25
We got lil warren buffet over here.
@_date: 2019-06-03 19:51:43
Spend in btc. Use bitrefill or something. You ll like hodling better. Plus legally avoid taxes on gains.
@_date: 2019-06-11 17:35:31
It should simply say “just hodl”. Keep the message simple so the bitcoin community relates and the mainstream audience becomes curious and interested about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:19:25
Imagine converting usd to euros, then euros become more expensive, and you make a purchase with your euros. Would you need to file taxes on the gains you made on the euro currency? I dont think so. It should be the same with bitcoin cause its exactly the same.
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:02:03
So pretty much is always a good time to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:26:39
Facebook will be the medium for the masses to use bitcoin. Like venmo but for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:35:58
Whats new man? Have u heard of banks and stocks before? Arent a few making huge profits and paid by fools? Life will be like that sometimes, sorry.
@_date: 2019-06-02 00:48:48
Hows bitcoin a credit card. U can only spend what you own.
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:19:14
Its so natural to be skeptical of something new. Ppl are even skeptical of their own ideas, until it clicks and they come up with crazy shit like bitcoin. On the other hand, being on denial is dangerous. Like craig wright.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:21:26
Smart kid lol
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:36:09
@_date: 2019-06-07 13:46:37
Timing is everything. Bitcoin rewards the patient. You are just rationalizing your decision even though you know everyone elses arguments. Dont get too greedy man.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:43:21
Not a loss til you sell.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:08:36
B U B B L E.
@_date: 2019-06-06 19:26:49
They r not wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:10:56
Restaurant has prices in dollars or btc? This meme doesnt make sense all the way.
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:06:22
buy and hodl
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:46:56
U r literally inferring that you can be successful like the ppl above with some bitcoin. Bitcoin aint a job bro.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:05:21
Maybe 1% has 18k lying around and hodls til 2021, maybe 1% of that is smart to hodl til 2025. Then yeah math checks out for lambos. Still only adds like another 0.01% to ppl who would pull that off in this sub. Making money is tough.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:10:16
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:16:13
How well did the government take care of your currency?
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:27:56
You sound like bitcoin hurt you.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:26:49
How long do you think it took to adopt dollars? You might think bitcoin is the bullshit money, but its fiat thats bullshit. Society is deep in a 1900s black mirror episode with government controlled currency. A new episode started with bitcoin in 2009 where society slowly takes control back of their money.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:04:11
Thats what the market is doing. Im sure some alts will prosper.  But few from thousands. And i doubt alts can prosper without bitcoin prospering.
@_date: 2019-06-17 21:26:46
We dont gain anything by hyping up bitcoin early. It ll take the time it needs. No one is trying to make a quick lambo. A long term lambo, yes.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:18:59
Looks like ppl are not ready to grasp bitcoin inflation lol. Bitcoin inflation is nothing compared to manipulated dollar inflation.
@_date: 2019-06-17 11:38:17
Excuse? I buy whatever i want. You buy whatever you want. We dont need an excuse. Does it bother you i dont care about alts?
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:51:59
Warren would def learn something from justin. He has been a student of money all his life.
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:02:34
Fuck fiat. Hold both bitcoin and gold.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:26:37
I guess they r both trying to feed each other and they both hate it. Classic.
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:06:19
No one really knows about bitcoin lol. Still really early.
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:52:18
10k is the new 1k.
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:03:42
Thats solid point.
@_date: 2019-06-15 06:15:57
1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin always.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:57:32
O wow really?? And u had to share your discovery with strangers? U must be the smartest man ive seen in a long time.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:25:11
HODL Wallet. You can set it up under advanced settings &gt; bitcoin nodes &gt; switch to manual mode.
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:54:11
O wow. So blocks continue to be mined every 10 min or so with no bitcoin reward but the lottery winner still collects the transaction fees? Thats beautiful.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:22:30
U know u dont have to buy the whole bitcoin. Its not like stocks.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:28:17
Yeah around 12-14
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:17:47
Thats the risk you take by making a bet lol. You think ppl that know each other pay their bets all the time too? Plus in a bitcoin sub it would be very easy to get paid lol. Its a great experiment they r having i would say. Proud of the community.
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:42:13
Should be “buy hold repeat”
@_date: 2019-06-20 13:00:19
Its crazy how history is gonna repeat itself again. Later in the future people will be more aware about how halvings affect bitcoin, but very few get it now. We are fortunate. I cant wait.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:42:15
I love how no one is gonna see bitcoin coming again.
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:16:34
What do you mean with zero btc circulation? Like zero people will use bitcoin one day? Where did you come up with that? Makes no sense. You are confused.
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:37:25
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:37:22
Only if u r the government. Then yeah makes sense.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:39:37
They could be very much starting to accumulate bitcoin rn. And it would be in their best interest to brush off crypto publicly to avoid a bubble.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:38:43
Coin stats on ios. Pretty solid.
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:03:00
Just spend it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:25:33
Bitcoin is backed by the goat. What else you need?
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:30:50

Sounds like a great plan! You ll have a great honey moon
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:41:18
Wtf is going on
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:44:49
You why
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:11:28
Hackers? Hows that bitcoins fault? Its caused by centralizations and bad management. Bitcoin illegal? Thats just banks spreading FUD. You cant shut bitcoin down. Real bad news would be the community losing interest and not building any more corporations and software to support bitcoin. Im 100% interested in bad news affecting bitcoin. Why wouldnt any hodler be interested?
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:29:14
Should be a no during bitcoin winter and yes after.
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:45:26
I think we ll be around 14-16k towards next year
@_date: 2019-06-18 02:23:33
Just HODL.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:43:54
Prob use it for a gift card at bitrefill. Or maybe a game at joltfun.
@_date: 2019-06-19 20:34:00
Why? Does sp500 look better ready to take off?
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:47:44
If bitcoin crashes to zero im pretty sure you ll buy a shitload of it on its way down... Just dont spend money you dont have. Thats not the bitcoin way. Thats the keynesian way. Good luck man.
@_date: 2019-06-08 14:13:24
Plus u got the transaction fees too.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:16:46
H O D L. 
B T F D.
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:49:46
Depends on the timing. If it happens before or after the inevitable bitcoin crash. Getting hit with a recession during bitcoin winter will look very ugly. Will be finding the bottom really quick most likely and then stabilize.
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:33:57
YOU DONT GET IT.

@_date: 2019-06-20 22:58:36
The more u pay the faster.
@_date: 2019-06-08 22:28:00
Just hodl lol. Next.
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:40:30
Yeah unfortunately i cant predict the future. Sorry about that. Have a nice day.
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:04:58
Small price to pay for salvation.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:22:32
No way.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:34:55
So every time i buy a beer or coffee with bitcoin i gotta track my capital gains?
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:13:40
Look how the turntables.
@_date: 2019-06-17 20:06:13
With facebook on board and the dollar inflation, this rocket is inevitable.
@_date: 2019-06-21 12:32:46
I got some cheap btc on sale. But i need $600 to get them from my uncles vault in nigeria. You down 50/50?
@_date: 2019-06-07 23:38:54
Bigger blocks means nodes gotta be more advanced so it weakens the network. How it is now, it makes it easy for simple computers to connect.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:23:25
Easy. Whats the dollar backed by?
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:00:59
I like green wallet the best.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:59:59
Last time i checked this is r/bitcoin. Why shitcoin ppl getting all offended? Why do i need to give credit to alts? im sure litecoin ppl were shiting on btc not too long ago. Its all good. Just do you whatever.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:21:06
Wahh ��
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:13:38
Hodl even if it drops to 4k.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:51:09
Ditto on GOT. Breaking bad is the GOAT.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:49:01
If you dont sell near ATH you ll be super sad for the next 4 years, maybe counting how many bitcoins you could have accumulated with your missed profits :,(
@_date: 2019-06-15 05:34:49
Increasing live?
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:48:34
Sounds like its gonna be a hell of a great dinner. Buffet will get a better look into a future he might not be around for.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:44:42
Most ppl got no clue tho.
@_date: 2019-06-01 15:41:36
Uncircumcised could get a tattoo under their foreskin.
@_date: 2019-06-10 23:12:24
Ppl would just sell btc to buy shit but not to hold fiat. Anyone with fiat, if they got a better alternative they ll take that. In argentina or venezuela, their best move is to get usd over pesos or bolivars. But now bitcoin has the potential to be the new alternative.
@_date: 2019-06-21 14:49:11
Thats really smart. Im 99% confident you ll do great.
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:58:17
Yeah japan is def the most advanced country with btc.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:37:57
Trust me. Market is never ready for the halving when it actually happens. The supply decrease is gonna shoot up the price like after every halving. Before halving anything under ath is game. Market has been adjusting to anticipate the event but it will fail to anticipate equilibrium and it ll get corrected up. I dont know thats just my opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:45:51
Not a descent post.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:05:34

@_date: 2019-06-19 16:39:53
Hold on to your iphones boys!
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:56:50
If its selling at 7500 and u price it at 7000, it ll sell on the spot... cause there will be buyers at that price.

Imagine how crazy is gonna get in 2 years.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:01:48
Lol hodling is hard when bitcoin is both low or high. But its harder to hodl when its low cause it hurts harder to lose money than to miss out on extra gains when its high. But yeah ok anyways have a good day.
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:28:37
Cool story bro.
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:47:31
I love bitcoin and all but warren buffet is the money goat. You really dont know what you are talking about if you think he just got lucky a couple times. One of his most famous quotes applies very well for bitcoin too “be greedy when others are fearful and be fearful when others are greedy”.
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:13:15

@_date: 2019-06-26 15:37:22
Cause of the halving every 4 years. Crashed in 2014... 2018... next is early 2022. I hope my advise works out for you. Good luck! O yeah the ath happens every 4 years too... 2013, 2017... 2021

@_date: 2019-05-26 11:44:33
Maybe for a business that runs in btc makes sense. Aka its expenses and sales are on btc
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:31:55

@_date: 2019-05-24 20:53:30
That was the move

Let it sink it a little. Time is coming tho

Who wouldnt love bitcoin rn.
@_date: 2019-05-27 12:07:12
This is just basic econ 101. Most ppl are sheep. Gonna buy when is hot and everyone is buying, gonna sell when is cold and everyone is selling.
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:59:18
Quiet around here and bitcoin is taking off. I love it.
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:41:46
O so op is saying he goes broke all the time so might as well invest money on btc. 
OP is high and is just rationalizing and preparing himself to fomo all in.
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:52:57
This ship is about to take off.
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:50:36
More like “-Hollywood” now.
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:36:00
Imagine we wont see bitcoin under 10k anymore after this
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:40:22
I like  Whats the equivalent these days? A barber? A stubborn friend? A dad coming around?
@_date: 2019-05-26 14:53:01
You either got money or u dont lol. Its like saying that shit was super cheap back in the day and now its super expensive compared to back then.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:20:25
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:45:26
Cause it looks like its gonna continue going higher. Why do ppl sell at lows? Cause it looks like it can continue going lower. Its common sense.
@_date: 2019-05-27 22:00:04
Should give them a toy too tho lol. Also make sure parents get educated about it.
@_date: 2019-05-29 01:58:04
It really is tho.
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:13:17
Whats the twist tho
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:06:59
Now its like wsb in here
@_date: 2019-05-19 23:26:25
U mean increase the wealth gap

I just bought a little at 8.8k. I keep saying “shit i should have bought at x, now its y”. I think this is gonna take off to 10k and never look back. But if it drops then i ll be loading up more. I guess if it goes up i ll load up more eventually too lol.

@_date: 2019-05-18 10:59:02
I bought with the idea of selling for 10x profit in like 5 years. Risk is it can go to nothing but the opportunity is you can get more than 10x in returns. When 5 years pass, you can re strategize but its more or less the same dilemma. If u need the money then you shouldnt be using it on bitcoin aka you should cash out bitcoin and pay the bills rather than be a homeless bitcoin owner.

Lol i did read what you wrote. Im just saying that if u needed the money it would be stupid not to sell. So you didnt do anything wrong. Just tough luck.
