This guy's a badass, Satoshi or not.  Extremely intelligent, and probably has an ego to go with it.  I think the humility was just a misdirection.  He intended to be disruptive.

It could mean more, depending on who is maintaining the off-chain ledger and whether they do aml/kyc.  It just means you are trusting someone to hold your coins.

The way it is looking with the block size debate, BTC will be used for larger-value transfers (where the fee per kb is cost effective), and micro-transactions will be handled by off-chain solutions, side chains, or altcoins.  Eventually, at least.

Damn.  I thought it was cheaper than that.  Someone else told me $200 on Twitter.  I must have been thinking of CRI, price-wise.  There is some value just in quality control (keeping really shitty people out).

Kaz is trashy, talks a lot of shit, has a lot of fake twitter accounts and a (relatively cheap) paid room where he teaches TA.  At least the dude has charts.  I don't buy in on all the moon stuff and you can barely see the TA for all the shittalking that he does, but it's there. 
Adam G runs a paid room where he promises "insider" information but all he does is lie and fucking scam to get people to send him non-reversible digital cash transactions while pretending to provide value. 
I really think that all these paid rooms are fucking scams on one level or another.  But I think it's fair to differentiate between ones where you might actually learn something and ones that are completely and totally based upon a series of lies and outright deception with the purpose of taking your money and giving absolutely nothing in return.

You are correct.  They use a standard mnemonic (one of the BIP's, can't remember exactly which one) format so you can use another wallet software if your Trezor breaks after Trezors stop being produced and the mytrezor site no longer exists.

The beauty of the Teamspeak server is that anyone can jump in and ask him their questions himself.  Much more productive than a witch hunt on I listened to the entire conversation.  The contents of this post were deleted before I got here, but I did listen in and all I heard was Phil being very candid and honest.  He's an enthusiast, an investor, and a part owner of an exchange.  And he also seems to have a strong sense of ethics.  I think it's great that he makes himself available and lends his voice and opinions.  Posts like this are why we can't have nice things.

Why do you think I would only send 6 cents?  You can send up to $25.  That an amount similar to what I carry in my wallet.  It's almost as if it's treating BTC as electronic cash, imagine that!

I'm not disagreeing with that, but it's a Facebook limitation.  Just like the Nike app or Words for Friends can't come into a group and comment on a status.  It's just an inherent limitation to avoid spam.

I have never understood the enjoyment some people get from coming into and shitting on every positive development and upbeat comment.  I could care less what you think, honestly.  I think ChangeTip on Facebook is fun.  The people I have tipped agree.  That's all the proof I need.
@_date: 2015-01-19 03:46:43
I can't wait until there is a more full integration.  Until then, I think just getting on to the platform is an incredible step.  Cheers!
Ever see how successful crowd funding campaigns like Youcaring and Indiegogo are through Facebook?  There is some incredible potential for integration into the platform through either ChangeTip or a similar service.  Just saying!
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:50:13
I've never tipped anyone on Reddit or Twitter.  That never really appealed to me.  I'm excited because I can exchange small sums over Facebook.
Obvious troll is still obvious.

You can also send a one-time tip through a Facebook message, although that feature was available before.
I think it's a great first step.  I'm sure the experience will improve with time.

You can always send them a PM with a one time tip link and a personal message.  I think they are limited by FB's app platform.

Reddit, Youtube, Twitter, and Facebook.  Which one is my Grandmother, Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, and almost every one of my friends using almost daily?
Hint: It's Facebook.
Edit: I'll add to that and say that I don't even know what my friend's Reddit names are, I only have 1-2 friends that have Twitter accounts (much less use them), and I don't know of anyone that actually uses their Youtube account for anything but passive viewing.  Facebook is a whole different level.
Edit2:  I sent out 10 ChangeTips to my friends and family this morning, and all but one of them has been collected.  Some of them have passed them on.  Facebook is where shit goes viral.  I've been completely skeptical of ChangeTip as a "killer app" exactly because they had zero integration with the largest social media site in the world.  That has now changed.  I look forward to seeing how they leverage the exposure and develop the platform. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:24:54
Was listening, can confirm.  Chaos_Elephant is absolutely correct.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:29:56
I fail to see why it is funny.  It's true.  Changetip is just an app.  Apps are limited within the FB ecosystem for a reason.  It's also a privacy issue.
If Changetip ever works the way everyone here wants, it will be because FB buys Changetip and integrates it directly into the platform themselves.  And they will never do that unless they have full control.  It's pretty simple.

I listened to the whole convo on teamspeak.  He was challenged by someone in the room, and when he was given a chance to explain he was explicit in explaining that he is simply a BTC holder, and he obtains bitcoin on his exchange through limit orders.  He doesn't use margin, he doesn't use market orders, he doesn't actively trade BECAUSE it would be a huge ethical issue.  People are constantly asking him for information on TS because they know who he is, and he is always very polite in saying that he can't divulge any information and explains the ethical implications.  I've always been impressed with his transparency when interacting with the public there.  It's really a breath of fresh air, and it gives me a lot of confidence in their platform, honestly.  
This whole post is a tempest in a teapot.  If people are going to post accusations they need to post a full voice recording, with context, or GTFO.
@_date: 2015-01-19 03:51:46
It's definitely a limitation of the API.  I think there is a great case to be made for more integration and refinement, but for a first step just getting on the platform at all is great.  I have hope that this is something that will be improved upon over time.
You can also tip through a FB message using the one time tip feature (even though that feature is technically platform agnostic)
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:11:59
I think with the way Facebook Apps work it's probably the best they can do for now.  I look forward to seeing what they can implement in the future.  It's a good first step.
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:44:20
HOLY SHIT!!  This is a way of putting Bitcoin in front of people in a way that is useful, and they can put USD back into their bank account!  This creates a platform that will actually stimulate adoption and create new buy pressure, instead of just giving people another reason to sell.  
I can now send my family members bitcoin in a way that she can use it.   They don't use Twitter, but they are ALL on Facebook.  
All the news about merchant adoption had a net result of increasing sell pressure in the market.  This is HUGE news that actually injects Bitcoin into the largest social network in the world and puts Bitcoin in front of people in a useful way.
This is the biggest news about Bitcoin adoption that I have heard since Coinbase and Circle.  
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:47:28
I think it's a different use case.  I consider it a good way to send someone you know a small amount of money if you don't have cash.  The integration with FB is more for awareness of the functionality than anything else.  I would be more likely to use the one time tip for in a message most times.
I might tip on reddit for good content, but I may tip on Facebook because my little brother is driving 100 miles to come help me out with something.  I don't have to ask for his BTC address.  I can send my friend a beer for his birthday.  I drop a few bucks into a crowd funding campaign.  I can split a lunch tab if I forgot my wallet (less than $25 of course).
The FB wall posting is mostly to make people aware that the functionality exists.  The next step will be to be able to adjust privacy so that only the recipient can see the Changetip.  And some sort of integration into a phone app (since the OAuth provides for pretty seamless linking on a phone)
It's not something that everyone will use, but there are some pretty common use cases that will expose people to bitcoin in an easy way and show how well it works for sending around small amounts of value.
No, I don't plan on using Changetip on FB to tip my friends for insightful comments or posts.  But if they integrate a way of tipping a Page (an organization or FB page for a website), then I would definitely consider tipping for content.  Or better yet: small crowd funding campaigns.

Actually in the car analogy, urban planners are slowly realizing that a world where every person has a car is unsustainable, and are making moves to discourage car use in many urban areas and encourage use of mass transit to reduce the traffic burden instead of just paving wider highways.

Good luck with that.  You have to cuck yourself to their narratives if you want to avoid mass downvotes.  The groupthink is out of control and your framing is all that matters.  If you use their framing, they are fine, because you are implicitly supporting or not sufficiently challenging the basis of their falsehoods.  As soon as you do, watch out.

People are realizing its a scam and their customers are confused due to scammy marketing.  This will incentivize all exchanges to delist, with the current direction that bcashers moving in I doubt they make any improvements - probably double down and claim martyrdom.

Because causing a chain split would cause more economic damage to their holdings than going along with a change that has broad consensus, and only political reasons for withholding support?
Their choice is to inject massive uncertainty by either A. Letting a 148 chain split happen (no one would transact out of fear) or B. Initiating their own hard fork.  Neither of those options is reasonable from the perspective of market certainty, and the market heavily punishes uncertainty.  They have to have supreme confidence that either of those options would result in a massively more valuable chain in the long term.

I don't think belittling anyone is going to break their resolve.

Stop saying it has very little support and instead say that you will support it, if Aug 1 comes and there is no other scaling solution immediately implementable.  
Everyone needs to stop pussyfooting around and being risk averse.  If scaling is important, then UASF is the deadline.  It only adds to the onus to get another alternative implemented, if that is what is going to happen.  No matter what, it is a net positive.  If miners attack the network to block UASF segwit, it shows their motivations to harm bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:23:10
All it would take is the patent holder to refuse a license, or negotiate lopsided agreements favoring one manufacturer over another.  Now the patent holder effectively controls bitcoin mining.  Welcome to centralization.

Some indicators are better than others.  In the recent runup from ~218 to ~271, I saw some indicators posted by others that were clearly showing where sell pressure was beginning to overtake buy pressure in the 260's.  Lo and behold, that indicator continued to show increasing sell pressure on the next 2 legs up (this is where large position traders were cashing out), and we then had a large retrace.  
TA has it's place.  Just like a filter on a camera lens, the picture will be shit unless you know which filter to use when taking into account the environment you are in.  It's not just voodoo, but it is complicated enough that people who don't understand it think that it is because they have never succeeded in applying it.  And I am not going to pretend that I am some sort of expert, either.

One has to assume that BIP91 could also be a delay tactic, which would explain why it is intentionally incompatible with 148.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:25:20
Wait until the NY agreement goes down in flames and the userbase sees that UASF is their most immediate path to relieving fee pressure.  
The mining cartel you implicitly acknowledge is harmful to bitcoin anyway.  Get your HF together, get it implemented (I would be delighted to see this happen) or get soft forked.  UASF is your incentive.  The fact that everyone seems to be so defensive trying to paint UASF as pointless, shows to me that it is a threat otherwise it would not even be part of the discussion.
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:27:31
Nice adhom but everything he said makes perfect sense. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 15:16:26
If this happens, the UASF will be a success even if it is not used.
We just want segwit, and we don't want any more BS excuses or turf battles.
