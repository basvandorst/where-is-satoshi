Hopefully the link will work this time!
This is a visualisation of the unconfirmed transactions on the bitcoin blockchain.  Orange blobs are the source addresses, Blue are the target and size of the blob is relative to the transaction size.  If i remember rightly, the grey line shows where two addresses can be linked - e.g. as the change address in a transaction.

lots of people giving money to one address.  Maybe a coin tumbler?  Not sure how those work though.

Wish it was mine to take credit for!

This is a visualisation of pending transactions on the bitcoin blockchain by an MSc student at Imperial college, London.  Orange is the source address and blue is the target address.  Size of the blob is relative to the size of the transaction.

If I remember right,  orange is input and blue is output.  It's why there are alarge number of three node transactions which are one orange two blue.   from,  to and change

It's a visual interpretation of the transactions.   Just because you don't like it,  doesn't mean it's not worth sharing

Agreed, not mine though but I do know the student who wrote it.   I'll see if I can put something together to explain it better.

You know it's time to get out when the fool is on board.

Diversification of investment.  A few hundred quid on the chance of another big spike in the next few years suits me fine.  It's not my retirement fund though

Thought I'd share this as much for how wrong the details of the story is as for the fact Bitcoin is now hitting the front page of one of the UK broadsheets, and a particularly conservative one at that

They were looking for a non PayPal donation mechanism and I suggested Bitcoins.  Duly done.  My first bit of advocacy

My First transaction there with someone with 100+ feedback was done in 10 minutes.

And this is directly proportional to difficulty, right?
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:00:19
Where and how?
@_date: 2013-09-22 14:53:39
All those preorders running at BFL offices

I nearly bought a 40GH share on one of those KNC miners but it wouldn't have started until January.  I'm glad I avoided it
@_date: 2013-10-07 07:24:20
Yeah, fully aware of the risk, hence only gamble what I can afford to lose on this one
@_date: 2013-11-14 21:49:53
Yup, bought two btc from localBitcoins about 8 weeks ago and it was done in less than hour.  Awesome service

Desperate for the Fed's to come knocking?  There are much easier ways
