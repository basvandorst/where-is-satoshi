If the Russian government doesn't like something that you do – lawful or not –, you're fucked anyway because they will find a way to frame or harass you.

Wired article tl:dr?
Edit: disatisfied with the replies, GF not in for sex, so I read the article: 
Overstock CEO hates Wall st. because they fuck shit up. Bitcoin is a big fuck you to Wall st. and is decentralized, not ran by shitty banks or shitty fed. Also lots of blah.

People losing their money do and say irrational things. 
And I think the hack stands by itself. Most people who lost their money at MtGox didn't appreciate or approve of the hack because their ID might have gotten stolen.

What's that in ... (never mind, cannot find UK pound sign)

Join the class-action lawsuit against mtgox and learn to control your greed next time a shady or unprofessional  exchange opens.

Products still have to be delivered to you, so you're no longer anonymous at that point. And it would be suspicious if you never had a proper job but own 3 Lamborghinis.

How about a trusted third party like a respectable notary. They deal with this kind of stuff more often but it costs money.

AP just made him read the bitcoin paper (asking if he wrote that).

Paywall for reading an article...
edit: haha, people took that seriously

Depends on how many people are losing their keys.

You could also see promoting Bitcoin as a long–term investment: Help Bitcoin become mainstream and you’ll get the Bitcoin community’s appreciation which will result in donations right now, AND you’ll get an easier way to get people to donate to Wikipedia in the future. Win-win!
So maybe you could add a huge banner to the top of every page that can only be dismissed by donating ;)

Database states there's money and BTC in MtGox accounts. 
Reality is there's probably none.

Or he could get hacked, hacker changing all addresses to point to his wallet. Or just a few addresses some of the time so that it takes a long time until it gets noticed...
