A company working against Bitcoin to use the ASICBoost trick. Now in a bad position. They think they can take over, or control, Bitcoin; And they failed.
Bitcoin is strong. Bitmain is only history.

Indeed the 'store of value' is important; Bitcoin is scarce; Even in a bear market we want to HODL Bitcoin.

POW is the only secure way. Anyway hydroelectric power plant is green; and kWh price can be competitive.

They already had cheap electricity. They played and failed...

As a long answer to the author of the main topic,; You should read the book 'The Bitcoin Standard'.
The scarcity affect the price of an asset; Without HODLers the price can't increase over the years... The BCASH mindset affects simple logic...

Meanwhile BCASH people are against Jimmy Song:
They are not aware that only Bitcoin is a 'hard money'...

And now we have all these ICOs and doubtful coins that do the same: They manage the money supply... e.g.: Etherum with a development meeting last week.
Bitcoin is now alone in the digital world with a 'hard money' property.

I share your view; Bitcoin / Litecoin and Monero are the only fair coins of the top 20.
But as a 'hard money'; Bitcoin is alone. Fair alt-coins are just toys and can't compete with Bitcoin. They don't have the network effect, and the fight with the BCASH people is reminder that the monetary policy of Bitcoin can't be changed.
BCASH are using misleading marketing, and now the price is only 7.9% of the BTC price. Now we know that Bitmain hold 1000000 BCASH, they are just holding a grenade with the pin removed....

Once Bitcoin will have 90% market cap again. We will forget about the others again...
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:03:07
Yes not all, but most of the top 20 are; Indeed only 3 are not in the shitcoins class. 
Anyway but a misleading marketing, and a centralized property is a good way to be in this class too.

Indeed. Even if this is not an absolute scam, a fair coin is useless anyway (litecoin...). The network effect we have with Bitcoin is an essential property.
We need only one 'hard money'; Like today the dollar is the main currency.
