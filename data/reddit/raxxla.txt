I suggest that you do some reading, between the differences of deflation and inflation of currency. Currently, you have them reversed in the way you think they work.

Just have them read the book The Little Red Hen. Then maybe they will understand.

I think what your trying to say is that the currency has devaluation (lost purchasing power) Not deflation. Along with the cost of goods and services has revaluation (increased).

The hardware is designed to be tamper-proof. They even brag about this when you open it. There is a card Saying "Did you notice? There is no anti-tampering sticker on this box." and then they explain why.

If possible I recommend making/keeping a backup of the gift your giving. Make sure to tell them that there is a backup. You don't know what they will do with the wallet you give them. And that way if they ever lose it or misplace it. You can help them rescue it. In turn, making yourself a Hero twice.

But in an economics class you'd be saying things that are incorrect.

"The US currency has had deflation for hundreds of years though"
The US currency has had **devaluation** for hundreds of years though
or 
The US currency has had **inflation** for hundreds of years though. 
Deflationary currency means that it becomes more valuable over time. Which allows you to buy more. 
Saying Inflationary currency means that it becomes less valuable over time.

Same here... except I kept backups of the paper wallets, and told them, in case they lose them. I now have more family &amp; friends asking questions, because of the rise.

I also gave loaded wallets to friends and family, telling them to call me if they were to ever use them. So I could help them understand how it all works. I also told them that I made backups of the wallets and keys. In the case, if they ever lost the wallet. Don't want bitcoin lost to the universe. So far nobody has called.

6 years from now, some Reddit post. "Someone at the beach gave me some Bitcoin but I lost the piece of paper. It's was worth $25 at the time, now it's worth $2500.00."

I was listening to an NPR podcast The Indicator/Planet Money, they actually used the Big Mac index for Venezuela to indicate how long someone has to work to afford a Big Mac in Venezuela. It's not good.

Looks like it works pretty well, already grabbed 6k from people. I can see why this works, it very confusing for most to see it's a scam.

Or you could just live off the Bitcoin you have and never change it to USD. That's the picture a lot of people don't see. Yeah, it's not as simple as it could be right now. But it will be in the short future.

"When I pulled my phone from my pocket it vibrated and the screen was black." 
Your screen could of been active inside your pocket, and just moving around caused it to try to input your password. It failed 10 times, so it wiped your phone.
