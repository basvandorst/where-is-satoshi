Miner can define, hence generally by fee.

Yeah, and the reason I sent this one with high fees is because I sent one with average fees several days ago when it looked like mempool was starting to clear... I was wrong so that one isn't going anywhere lol.

You've just described the speculative behaviours that drive a bubble.

You do know that's not how valuation works, right?

Absolutely agree on housing. It is a much more tangible asset market that was worked over by derivatives.
.com bubble though? 
Bitcoin may be an Ebay, Amazon, or Pornhub** level success story.  It could end up more of a Yahoo or Myspace. Hopefully not Pets.com. Time will tell.
**Ok, PH wasn't from the .com era... but that user adoption!

If market share is the measure, every single clothing brand is niche. Or almost any product in a market with a large number of competitors.
I would agree with your comment about consumers of a unique variety. If smartphone users are the market, are Apple targeting a small % of users with specialized needs?
Against Nokia for context (who were approaching 50% market share back then)... maybe, given iphones are all relatively premium handsets, but I doubt Vanjoki thought apple would be anywhere near as successful in the phone arena as they have been.

This is exactly why we were saying "f*ck right off with your immigration and European community" during the brexit campaign. Thinking so far forward that we're seeking better times from the past, those "good old days" that arguably may not have been better and certainly can't be revisited. But we don't believe in impossible. We believe in a brighter shade of grey for our lonely little island of diminishing significance!
Plus the whole thing smacked of equality. Even bigots, xenophobes and racists need to feel a sense of community and belonging. God bless the queen, old chaps!

So the story has inspired young and active people and thats whats driving the market. Its not fundamentals. Its not like its a fundamentally important thing"


Taking all words verbatim, at no point did anyone say there is no value behind the technology. He did say, in the context of the current bitcoin market, it is not being driven by fundamentals, it's not a fundamentally important thing.
Let's put it in context of other words he said:




As I have asked, to whom is bitcoin currently a fundamentally important thing, factoring fee issues, current B2C adoption, political uncertainty, competition, the whole lot, and does it justify the market cap currently exceeding $50B? I can't quantify either, so don't claim to know. This is not about cryptocurrency as a technological innovation, now or in the future, but the Bitcoin market right now, current state. Too much forward looking is speculative.


I don't like this guy; I don't know this guy. Again you're choosing to infer something from things not stated. I want to be clear that my objective is defending the position, **not** the person, because I think it's important to recognize that taking this position doesn't preclude someone from being informed; the most you can infer is that it makes them aware of risk in financial markets. 
In the context of the conversation, I'd say it's reasonable to be concerned about risk of bubble behaviours. Granted, many see it a less likely for bitcoin than for altcoins, but there is a clear risk. I would wager there is uninformed buying and panic selling occurring, the full extent of this is difficult to know. I'm not selling as I believe in the long term view, but also not investing greater than I can afford to lose due to the risk.
You should listen to your own advice and focus on the actual words said instead of adding your own, and appreciate the context in which things are said.

If we were to assume bitcoin mining was powered by 'clean' sources, wouldn't we be ignoring opportunity cost? IMHO the incremental impact shouldn't be measured by the cleanest input into the grid, but the dirtiest. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:08:54
I don't think his comments prove what he does or doesn't grasp. 
There wasn't mention that cryptocurrency has no value or potential; rather there seemed to be questioning of the current price vs value of bitcoin specifically. The term bubble is generally used in relation to a relatively short economic/financial timeframe, after all.
Internet commerce wasn't a fad or without potential. And then the clock struck 2000.
Houses weren't a fad or without potential either. And yet bubbles have been burst.
If you think of a bubble being the just speculative premium that overlays the current underlying value, it may be less offensive to hear that we could be in a bubble right now.
To me, this was quite fair for a brief discussion (considering it wasn't far from a fluff piece on a topic they know is trending). Messages of DYODD will likely be good for bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:41:55
He didn't say there is *no* fundamental value.
To how many people is bitcoin fundamentally important too *right now* of those that are putting money into it or are even really aware of what it is?
I would argue that the large swings over relatively minor announcements indicate that there is a high level of emotion or speculative investment inflating the price. By definition, speculative pricing is not fundamentals based.
Perhaps you are trying to apply a technology question to the finance answer that we are likely in a bubble.
And lets be clear, not all bubbles pop.

I find the term 'clean' a little misleading. Cleaner than alternatives, sure.
Regardless, it seems unlikely that mining will be all powered by renewable sources in the foreseeable future and if the energy requirement continues on the current trajectory, it will be an issue that needs to be addressed.

I think they got it wrong way around. Microsoft was first, then Apple.
Alternatively, you could say Motorola was first, then Apple. Or Nokia. Or Samsung. Because the specifics don't really matter, the point remains the same. Being first doesn't mean much in the long run. Being the best does.
