Do to the deflationary tendencies of the currency itself, In my opinion this would cause a global mind shift into consumers expecting  products that are better in quality and last longer. There for more expensive but wont lose value as quickly (cars for example) If we know that the money im spending now will rise in value I am now expecting products that will hold there value longer there for giving me the best bang for my buck.  Instead of the current mindset of products that are half assed and made to break after a short time period. This is just speculation but purchasing power for employees would increase on average. The overall need for employees would decline but a Single worker could support More people on a single income while still living above a poverty gap. While a smart Worker would only need to work for 10 or 20 years and be able to retire and live a comfortable life style

I agree, seems to me there needs to buy a way to generate money. I think the escrow service needs to be heavily incorporated into its own database of Merchants, then regulate sellers by putting maximum purchases and possibly charging a declining percentage fee after the seller has successfully completed so many transaction lower the fee. If a merchant has a higher percentage of disputes then normal blacklist them ect.

Hours worked per household has close to doubled since then I'am sure. Now 2 people work to produce roughly the same ratios. Pretty much the norm these days. Our time is the most valuable thing we have.
