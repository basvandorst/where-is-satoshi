Or maybe your fee is ok.  Change is too low, so miner see non standard input and rejected transaction.

You are right, but government has big political influence in google too, so  it is just matter of time when this phenomenon will show it self on google store too. All that is just because of the political game where bitcoin and other crypto currencies are eyesore of centralized banking system.

For example:
Currently bitcoin based blockchain has good security and privacy because of cryptography, but privacy is good only until you do not know the owner of public btc address.
In other words block chain as distributed public 
ladder is good only in one thing - storing the public information and keep them safe until user make an mistake and give access to his private keys.
I think it can rather be used for forums and blogs then for email system.
