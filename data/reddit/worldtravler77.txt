Confidence in the case of something like bitcoin is everything--since the expectation of future/continued demand is itself the basis of value (like fiat currency but without any force of law behind the demand)--and it has a ricocheting, or rippling, effect.  If enough people become skeptical or nervous, that will put downward pressure on price.  So say bitcoin--as a result of a minor loss of confidence, in the face of increasing numbers of people using a new competing digital currency, though it's still a currency with extremely weak liquidity and a tiny number of users compared to bitcoin--so say as a result of this minor challenge bitcoin goes from 550 dollars per bitcoin to 530, or from 400 Euro to 390.  (In other words, the dollar is not getting stronger; bitcoin simply weakens slightly relative to traditional currencies.)  This price decline induces some more people to sell in response--more than the number of people who were induced to buy at the "on sale" price of 530, since it was never much of a bargain in the first place, as a minor price decline.

Haha, I'm actually waiting for Coinbase to fund my account in fiat (they always take longer than what they proclaim (like 2 days), and then will jump back in very quickly as there is no stopping Bitcoin right now!

It seems like we are in a slow, healthy rise right now.  But with bitcoins, you never know.

I always suggest Coinbase.com to my friends new to bitcoins, since its easy, simple, and trustworthy (backed by reputable VC's).  Only downside to Coinbase is liquidity, but if you're doing a small time investment-its the way to go.

I'm just surmising based on Bitcoin Tradiing forecasts, and what I've read in other subreddits that people want to sell at $1,000.  In other words, its just conjecture.  However, if it accelerates to $1,0000 very quickly like haelan suggested than we might see a sharp correction.  I'm just perturbed that I sold off 8 coins this past Wednesday due to panic, and want to jump in at the next dip.
