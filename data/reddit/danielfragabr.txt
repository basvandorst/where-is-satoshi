I compiled 0.13.0 and it seems the initial 288 blocks verification is much slower (it's taking several more minutes. At this pace, it will finish in a hour, while the previous version took just only 1 or 2 minutes or more):

Any idea why this verification is so slow compared to 0.12.1?
**UPDATE**: after 20% it took a few minutes and it reached 100% fast.

Engage with those who "follow orders" is the same as to engage with robots. This remember the "Chain of obedience":
"Bitcoin" doesn't need to engage with anyone to exist, so I think it's a waste of time. It would much better to solve technical problems Bitcoin is facing and improve the protocol than to engage with bureaucrats. What's the point of engaging with parasites? This means you not only recognize them, but respect them... Why do you respect a parasite? Why try to talk to a thief? This is humiliating.

Besides that, what really pisses me off about exchanges is when they force the user to calculate how much bitcoin he wants to buy or sell. It's much easier to just type the equivalent amount of fiat currency (for example: I want to buy $50 of BTC so I type $50 instead of forcing me to divide 50 by the &lt;BTC price&gt;).
 
 
Bitfinex and Quadrigacx unfortunately force the user to input the BTC amount instead of allowing the user to input the fiat currency amount.

The only people complaining are those desperate that sell mcxFEE at a loss and can't wait for version 3 of the site.
Yes, it was a bad decision to halt trading, but what is done is done. Now let's wait for the v3 site. Don't sell your mcxFEE. Just wait.

Private site, private rules. This is the fastest exchange I've ever used. All others are a piece of crap. And no other exchange is capable of paying interest, neither they offer something like mcxFEE.

Buy bitcoin before they reach US$ 1000 or even higher, otherwise will'll regreat a lot more.

This is a shame for Bitstamp. They are efficient at checking ID documents, but for receiveing deposits are very slow?
