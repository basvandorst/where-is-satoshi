I use a 970 and a 1050ti and am making about $5/day mining zcash with SlushPool. Google Nvidia zcash miner.

Probably not. Set up two factor authentication to protect yourself in the future.

Wow, that's amazing!

Right now is the best time to xfer to a Segwit wallet, fees are low.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:36:23
You need to send from a Segwit wallet to get the "Segwit discount"
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:37:42
Have you found a way to backup the wallet? I haven't been able to figure it out.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:43:38
No if you send to another Coinbase user using their email address that is registered with Coinbase, there is no fee.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:47:53
It won't.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:31:15
This is the one I use. Just change the config file to point it to your SlushPool worker

Shave your pubes, get it tattooed, then let your bush grow back.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:35:38
I just doubt Coinbase would actually reimburse you for that since they aren't at fault.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:15:55
USAA is an investor in Coinbase. I've never had an issue with them. They have business accounts if you're eligible.

You could say the same thing about any altcoin. Altcoins have come and gone, but Bitcoin has remained strong.

For Android I use Samurai Wallet and for PC I use Electrum.  Both offer many more features than [blockchain.info]( wallet and allow you to hold your own keys.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:06:37
Yeah, I use them and never had an issue.
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:44:56
They definitely do, you have to use the desktop version of the website. For some reason it doesn't show up on mobile.
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:31:53
Was it positive?
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:25:37
Very true. I've been actively learning Spanish for over 6 years now and I still suck at it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:25:25
Saw it too! 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:20:22
You would send them directly from Coinbase/GDAX to your hardware wallet address.
Edit: You can xfer out of Coinbase or GDAX, GDAX just has no tx fee when sending out (at least for the US.)
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:54:19
No problem at all. My cousin and I run Mycyrpto.guru on Facebook. Feel free to ask us questions.

If I have not been keeping track of my costs basis but sell my Crypto for a profit, what do I do for taxes....? Hindsight is 20/20.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:26:24
If it has a QR code with the private key you can sweep the wallet with mycellium.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:07:37
The wallet will generate your private key usually as a set of 12 to 24 random words which get ran through an algorithm that creates your private key. Do not store those words on any device that connects to the internet. Write them down and put them in a very safe place because if anybody gets a hold of your private key they get ahold of all your crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:33:00
Use an application where you control the private keys like Electrum or Exodus. For Android, I like Coinomi.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:27:43
Yes it does, but if you need them instantly it's a good option.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:16:36
Do you have any suggestion on how to get forked coins on a smartphone? Coinomi is the only one I know that does this.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:16:13

USAA is a major investor in Coinbase. USAA and Navy Fed have never given me any issues.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:07:38
If you own your private keys or master seed your Bitcoins are safe. You can import the keys into another Bitcoin wallet to retrieve your coins if Electrum fails you.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:53:25
Software wallets encrypt the private keys on the device but hackers can still use keyloggers to figure out your password or Master seed so a hardware wallet is the most secure place to store your crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:33:40
It usually goes up on YouTube a few hours after
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:46:28
If you store it yourself you will have access to the private keys which you can import into a wallet that supports a forked coin. I personally do not trust any online wallets many have been hacked over the years but if I were to store my Bitcoin on an online wallet I would store on coinbase. If you want to store them yourself and have access to the private keys I would suggest either electrum or Exodus for the PC or Coinomi for Android. But the most secure way to store it is in a hardware wallet like the Trezor or the Ledger Nano S.
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:46:41
- Store your own crypto, do not trust online wallets. Most secure way is with a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger Nano S
- I would not suggest day trading, timing the market is impossible.
- I personally diversify into a few alts like Litecoin, Etherum, Dash, and Zcash but Bitcoin is a majority of my portfolio.
- I buy small amounts over time to average out the price fluctuations.
- ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE.
EDIT: JUST HODL IT

TD Ameritrade said they had Bitcoin futures in their commercial just a minute ago.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:07:08
Send all you BTC to one on you own addresses to consolidate your unspent outputs when tx fees are low.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:58:14
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:20:18
Yeah with Litecoin you have to convert the M address to a 3 address (or vice versa). There are many converters online. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:33:03
Sorry, never used Armory. You could try to sweep it but that puts you private keys at risk by exposing them to mycellium.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:42:53
True but they would still need to capture the password that the wallet was encrypted with.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:49:41
Electrum gives you access to your master seed which you can always import into a wallet that supports segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:15:38
I use multipool.us
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:22:26
God, I hope not. That'll be a terrible business move.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:58:27
:( Sorry for your loss

That's what  Reddit is for. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:10:17
GDAX has fees but they are much lower than Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:05:24
I would try and reach out to BTC.com support if available.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:02:33
Shapeshift will probably support the 2X altcoin when it releases. I'm going to wait till then and convert to BTC. Make sure you own your private keys.

Mycellium is considered safe but anytime you expose an unencrypted private key to a internet connected device you are putting it at risk. If your device is infected with malware, it is possible it can swipe it.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:36:03
Exodus is not a hardware wallet, it's a software wallet where you control the private keys. Hardware wallets keep your private key from ever touching the internet by signing the transaction on the device itself.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:13:07
If you want to use a phone app, Coinomi would be your best bet to get the forked coins. They had BCH support within a week after release.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:23:00
I've only bought from Bitmain.com and never had an issue.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:58:49
Just buy a little bit at a time if you want to average out the price fluctuations.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:27:28
Yes, Segwit is backwards compatible.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:39:17
Don't invest what you aren't willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:41:42
Coinomi should have a S2X implementation soon after the release. With the Bcash Fork they had implemented in a couple weeks. Electrum and Exodus will give you access to your private keys so you can import them into a wallet that does support segwit2x. Right now there are no segwit2x wallets due to it not being released yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:08:35
I've never tried eGifter, but I have used Gyft many times without issues. You have to wait till 1 confirmation before you can actually use the gift card.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:09:12
No, but your signed transactions are transferred over http. Your private key stays encrypted on the device. I know it sucks, but it's the easiest way to store your alts.
Edit: and get your forked coins on a mobile device.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:40:38
If you want to use Segwit addresses, then yes.

You will have to pay the Bitcoin tx fee to transfer out. Amount of the fee depends on  how many txs are waiting to get processed by the Bitcoin network. If you have GDAX in Canada (owned by Coinbase) they cover the Bitcoin network fees and you can use your coinbase balance. There's no penalty for not using the coins, they are yours. I'm not sure if Gemini exchange is in Canada, but they are good as well.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:20:30
As long as you own your private key you will be able to get your forked coins. I wouldn't trust Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:11:08
I never had an issue sending to a Segwit address from Coinbase or GDAX.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:25:01
I love my Trezor device. It's easy to set up and use. Supports BTC, BCH, LTC, ETH, ETC, DASH, and Zcash Ledger Nano S is also great and supports more types of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:20:01
2X is the upcoming forked coin. Make sure you are buying BTC from a reputable vendor, I use Coinbase in the US. If you don't feel comfortable storing the coins yourself, you can put them in a "vault" on Coinbase. Just be aware that you are trusting a third party to keep your coins safe. Make sure to use a strong and unique password. Also, if you do not store your bitcoins yourself you might not get access to any forked coins if there is another fork, it depends if Coinbase implements the fork or not.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:11:29
Yes they are fully backward compatible.
@_date: 2018-07-19 02:44:07
It's called CanaDough.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:30:17
Either trezor will enable them in it's wallet or you can import your private key (using your master seed) into a wallet that supports the forked coin and extract them.
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:52:08
Look for Bitcoin Core, Electrum, or Exodus on his computer. Obtain death certificate and will and contact Coinbase if you are in the US, it is the most popular exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:18:07
When you sell just be sure to note your gains. You will have to pay capital gains tax on that when it comes time to file your taxes.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:28:28
You can make a paper wallet for now or store in software like Electrum. Not as safe as a hardware wallet. If you device gets stolen they would still need to know your PIN to get in. I know the Trezor self wipes after 15 incorrect pin attempts. To recover your crypto use your master seed it gives you when setting up the device.
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:00:01
What wallet are you using? Do you have your master seed or access to your private keys? If so, you should be good.
@_date: 2017-10-10 02:25:19
You can use a credit card on Coinbase for instant buys
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:42:06
Yes it's a USB stick. A hardware wallet is the most secure way to store crypto. I personally use a Trezor.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:39:53
Not yet, they stated that they will enable BCH withdraws at the beginning of next year.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:44:11
Yes, it's also called a memonic phrase.
@_date: 2017-07-19 00:15:36
What exactly are the higher hardware requirements? A larger hard drive and a faster internet connection?
@_date: 2018-12-28 23:07:03
Surprisingly well written and accurate article!
@_date: 2019-05-26 18:17:22
Trezor for Bitcoin and popular altcoins, Coinomi wallet for shitcoins.
