This is an incredibly confusing and contrived example. How can the driver deliver food that was stolen and why would a truck driver be directly selling food to food banks? It makes absolutely no sense.

Didn't they just steal from the UK pension funds?

In my country most police don't carry guns, the criminals don't carry guns, in fact almost nobody carries guns.
If there was the political will, the same could happen in the US but never will because people like playing with their toys and feeling powerful. 
I love it when pro-gun Americans go all Rambo fantasy, describing how they will easily and heroically kill intruders and bad guys. It's hilarious. The reality is 99.9% of them will just use a gun recreationally and most that are involved in a firearm related death will be killing themselves or a family member, and that's a fact. 
Totally illogical.

The difference is is statistically much more likely to die from a bullet since he has a gun. Well done Phrenico

Aren't most deaths are due to accidents? Some kid finds the gun and blows their head off? 
Self defence? Pfft bullshit you just like playing with your toy and feeling all powerful.

What the hell does the murder of Lee Rigby have to do with anything?

It's actually a great explanation and I suspect you just don't understand complexity.

You know there are counties in the world where most (all normal) police do not carry firearms? They are also safer than the USA

This is just such bullshit.
Bitcoin provides a poor and confusing user experience for normal everyday people doing normal everyday things.  That's why it's so niche and why most people will never use it. 
I know the bitcoin community is a bit delusional but accusing people of being part of some conspiracy is rather sad.

Nobody outside of the bizarre and obsessive bitcoin community gives even the vaguest of fucks.

Nailed it. This is the usual boring anti-western fantasy
