They don't hold your coins, they hold transactions, in a ledger essentially. There is no counterparty risk because if they try and cheat, you can broadcast the last state of the ledger, since the transactions are timelocked you have time to do so. Its not at all like a bank.

But you can get your funds back whenever you want, they cannot stop you from doing so... I think you have some more reading to do. Its not like they are sitting there flush with your bitcoins, lending them out to people like a bank does, with only an IOU and 0.5% interest. It is nothing like a bank. Stop spreading FUD.

Theres no reason we can't use a different base unit so prices look more similar to traditional currency. So if something costs 0.2BTC, and the base unit is milliBTC, we would say it costs 200 mBTC. 0.02BTC would be 20 mBTC. Its all arbitrary, we could standardize on any unit of BTC. Consider this, in the USA 1 calorie is actually 1 kilocalorie, meaning the unit we use for calories is actually 1000 calories.

If you were a futures trader you would understand that for every short there has to be a long. Futures are zero-sum markets. Your scenario makes very little sense.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:37:04
First off for every short in the futures market there is a corresponding long. So that argument makes 0 sense, as futures are zero sum. As to the rest, zero hedge is a sensationalist rag which cherry picks data and stats, and regularly misstates information to fit a specific political theme.

QC does very little for SHA hashes, so it would not cause a big problem w mining. It does allow attacks on public keys though, so you would need to keep your public key secret until they forked bitcoin to a new, quantum computing resistant address system:

Of course its easily implemented, its literally shifting a decimal point a few places.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:57:13
By that logic, if I hold cash I also don't have anything until I "sell" it. Its an argument I suppose, but not one rooted in reality. If I can transfer my bitcoin for something of value, then I don't need to sell before I realize an increase in my worth.
@_date: 2018-10-28 14:24:42
QC doesn’t break SHA256. It reduces the search space to 2^128 which is still prohibitively large. It does break public key crypto though.

Ethernet is not really drastically different. Yes we have GMII and RGMII interfaces, along with full duplex so no need for CSMA/CD anymore, but we are still (primarily) using copper twisted pair. And Layer 2 really isn't all that different than it was then. Not to be too pedantic.

Its not THAT deep. Any senior level developer can read Mastering Bitcoin in a week or so and get most of the details. That is part of what makes it so genius, its really a relatively simple design, and the properties are emergent from that design, not explicit in the code.

This is terrible advice. You have no consideration for replay attacks in your instructions.
Better advice would be to use an exchange which plans to support both to send a small amount of split coins to your wallet, then send the entire contents of your wallet to a new wallet. Since your wallet was “tainted” by the split coin from the exchange the transaction will be valid on one chain only. Very important that after you receive the split coins from the exchange you remember to send your entire wallet so it includes the tainted coins. 
This method will link all your addresses together so its bad for privacy, but its very easy to do.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:50:27
It isn't about public validation, it's about someone forgoing billions of dollars and not trying to guide his creation through all this controversy. It just seems very unlikely to me. You can have your differing opinion without attempting to insult me.

Sudden dips are meaningless if you hold, and DCA only works if the general trajectory is not generally up from when you would have bought lump sum. If he does a lump sum buy now, and bitcoin continues its climb to 10k, he will have been better off doing that than DCA. No method is perfect, and so its not quite fair to say what is "best". I would say if he wants to get 1 BTC and plans to simply hold it for the long term he may as well just buy it all at once.

lmfao are you serious? Satoshi is on the other side? Where did you find that ridiculous information? The guy is most likely dead, but whoever he is/was, we certainly don't know the answer to that. You really believe a guy worth billions would keep his identity so secret, and not move a single satoshi out of his wallet? People frequently try and talk about what Satoshi would say or do, and you think hes quietly just supporting bcash / S2X and not stepping up and saying "actually, I am Satoshi, and here's what I think"?

I bought 1 BTC the other day and set up a daily $100 buy. But I want more action. I do have a compulsive streak that I need to be wary of, so maybe I am being illogical, but I feel like I can just HODL what I get on margin and ride out whatever happens. I should probably stop and think more about this before I do anything.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:51:35
Yes, that is true and a good thing to mention (though the article covers it).

Your strategy carries enormous risk for relatively little gain unless you have a shitload of capital tied up. For most of the people here it is a losing strategy and they will see all their profits go to taxes and fees. For many more they will fail to react properly and not have any profits. That is precisely why the general advice is to hold. If its been working for you great, but you could just as easily end up selling off your BTC only to watch it go higher and higher, not lower. That is why I think it is generally terrible advice to be telling people to try and time the market.
Furthermore, investing in BTC IS value investing.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:04:06
Not looking to trade, only to buy investments I actually believe in and the only alt I have any faith in besides BTC is LTC, which I plan to hedge my bets on BTC with. I don’t have any faith in any other alts right now, but I know admittedly little about any besides BTC (and its forks), LTC and ETH.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:38:24
The thing is I have a high income and am only 31. I don’t think it would affect me much even if the BTC went to 0. It would sting, but I’ve pissed away more on things like cars and watches. I guess I need to think about what the pros and cons really are though. Frustrated I didn’t get into BTC earlier and hoping to “catch up” I suppose. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:44:06
Or it could have just kept going up and force you to buy in higher. Hindsight is 20/20. For a few hundred profit on a $5500+ investment it hardly seems worth taking that risk. If you believe in BTC, hold and just use dollar cost averaging. Buffett didn’t get rich by trying to time the market in such short intervals. Doubtful you will either.
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:51:28
Like the other guy pointed out, this links all your addresses together, so isn't ideal from a privacy standpoint. There are other ways to split the coins that may be better from that perspective, but this is probably the easiest to do and hardest to fuck up.
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:09:22
Why buy a stock that tracks BTC when you can just buy BTC? There are even BItcoin IRAs now so you can put BTC in a tax advantaged account.

Its going to be a spectacular failure. There is 0 chance they can deliver on this. There are very big reasons VR is pretty limited in the size of environments. It has a lot to do with graphical horsepower, but also, inherent limitations on floating point math. As the world scales, simulations become increasingly inaccurate. Inaccuracies that may be tolerable in a traditional game, but won't be in VR. So a large scale world like this seems unlikely to be very seamless or good in my opinion.

If you send the whole wallet, it has to include the input with the split coin.
Say you have .0002 BTC on Coinbase and 1 BTC in your own personal wallet. After the fork, you split on Coinbase and send that .0002 to your wallet which is the same on both chains, but as a 1X transaction from Coinbase. Then, after its confirmed, you create a new wallet, and send 1.0002 BTC to the new wallet. It will necessarily contain the input of the coin that was split from Coinbase, so the transaction will not be replayable on the 2X chain. That leaves 1 BTC in your original wallet, on the 2X chain, and 1.0002 BTC in the new wallet on the 1X chain (ignoring fees for simplicity).
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:01:57
It wasn't stupid. When it hit $6100 it could have kept going all the way to $7100 as far as anyone knew. Just hold, it will go well beyond that. As long as you can afford to wait for your gains (and you really should only be investing what you can afford), it won't matter in the end.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:50:10
Basically, you would send the split coin to the wallet, doesn't matter that it is on cold storage. That wallet now has a transaction on it which is only good on one of the chains. Then if you create another address on the wallet, and send the ENTIRE (that is key here, and obviously means you need to take it out of cold-storage for this step) wallet amount to the new address, it will cause the new wallet address to contain the coins from a different chain than the original wallet.

Bitcoin can easily be confiscated if they simply threaten imprisonment if you don't give it to them.
Bitcoin can easily be censored in transfer if centralization occurs.
Bitcoin is only useful if there is still a stable electric grid and access to some kind of network with computing devices.
If coins are used for criminal activity, they can essentially be considered no longer fungible if no one wants to accept those coins. We are already seeing Coinbase banning accounts for using Bitcoins for things they don't agree with such as dark web purchases or gambling.
I love Bitcoin, don't get me wrong, but there are still PLENTY of caveats to everything you are talking about.

Again, just because early adopters benefit, doesn't make something a pyramid scheme. Was the Facebook IPO a pyramid scheme? Google?
Yes, those who get in earlier (and hold) will be rewarded more. That is not what makes something a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:15:10
People buying and holding do not make Bitfcoin a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a very specific type of scam based on the concept of "down lines" with money 'trickling up" which is unsustainable because it requires unsustainable exponential growth. Just because something rewards those who got in early, does not make it a pyramid scheme. Otherwise every single IPO, and really every stock would be a pyramid scheme. Once Bitcoin hits critical mass, yes, it will not continue exponential growth, but at that point we are talking about Bitcoin being a stable currency / store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:05:06
Assuming Coinbase allows you to split its easy. Just keep a tiny amount of BTC there prefork and then you can split it, and send it to your actual wallet. Then you send the entire contents of that wallet to another wallet you control. Since the split coin from Coinbase “taints” that whole transaction it will only be valid on one chain, leaving your original wallet on one chain and your new one on another. Essentially the “faucet” method from the above link.

Bitcoins are generated through "Proof of Work", which is computing a very hard math problem, in BTC's case it is SHA-256. All the mining hardware out there is built specifically for SHA-256. If Bitcoin changes that algorithm, all those billions of dollars in hardware become worthless overnight.
