No it's an honest question directed at the BTC community. Everyone's so damn sure BTC will continue to go up, in fact to say it's going to double this year is one of the most conservative estimates you'll ever see. And yet at the same time people are like "Don't be a jackass and invest TOO much this late in the game". So which is it? BTC is vulnerable to a crash from which it would never recover? Or BTC is going to double/triple/quadruple?
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:55:16
For people who just got into the game, this is a valid concern. Maybe they got in just as BTC enters another year-long stagnation/dip.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:06:08
Yeah, Bitcoin dropped damn near 50%, I don't understand portraying it as the one unaffected.

This was me when I spent a small amount on bitcoin in 2012. I watched the charts for two days, saw that I lost $50, thought "Oh god what have I done? I've gambled my family's money like a fool!" and sold it all, never touching bitcoin again until 2 months ago.

The second one. Two months ago I was googling how to get a loan to buy bitcoin and only seeing discussions saying NEVER EVER DO THIS meanwhile a guy who did exactly this is sitting on well over $1M in BTC now. People argued he still made a dumb decision that just happened to work, I would argue that people like him and me just believe in BTC and have balls. Kind of amazing how the same people who insist that BTC will go up another tenfold in a year or two suddenly turn into the biggest skeptics when it comes to borrowing for BTC. But I digress. I'm not getting a loan, I have no house to mortgage like the guy. Just regular ol' checking and savings.

I'm the kind that has a lot invested, and if bitcoin were to plunge by 40% or more I would start losing my investment. I consider that an okay buffer, since the worst dip in the last year was about 30%.  
BUT  
I am starting to ponder making arrangements to be notified automatically, immediately, and in the loudest way possible, if BTC is crashing. I know price alerts seem like they'd do that but I mean something that would wake me up if I'm sleeping, or notify me at work where I can't have my cell phone and don't always have internet access on the computer. Something that will scream "STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND CHECK BTC" better than a phone buzzing ever could.

I don't see how they could possibly have a motive to stop people from buying and selling during major dips and spikes. They make their money by charging fees to every transaction. No transactions, no revenue. And since the fee is a percentage, they would benefit *more* when customers can sell at a high, so I don't get how they would profit by keeping its customers from selling their bitcoin until the price has sufficiently dipped.

Yeah fees should be considered a mere annoyance, not a deterrent to buying. Doing the math, for every $1 I paid in fees, I made $30. And I already spend more on fees than I have to because I do occasionally make a debit card purchase at the 4% fee. So you know what, fuck the fee haters, I don't mind paying.

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:49:53
Not me, apparently, but I think I've learned from it. I made a really bad impulse decision that made me lose even more than necessary.  
I had been hearing the news about BCH insider trading and the coordinated attack on BTC and thought hey that's shady, but since my interest was investing, I couldn't argue with the fact that BTC was in sharp decline while BCH was rising fast. So what did I do? I sold my weekly max worth of BTC and threw it all on BCH. It was at an ATH when I bought and then it literally never went up a dime from there, instead crashing harder than BTC. This completely erased all the progress I made in 2 months, and even got so bad that I could no longer say "At least I didn't lose any of the real money that I put into it" because the losses cut into that too. I used all my buy and sell limit so I couldn't immediately reverse my bad choice and sell all the BCH and and put it back on BTC, and just stomach the several hundred dollars in fees. I have to wait a few days until I can totally fix this.  
But luckily the price looks like it's going back up for all cryptos. That's just in the past 2 hours, but I'm trying to be optimistic.  
tl;dr - I fell for the BCH trap and went all in. Don't do that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:58:13
It's amusing to watch the delusion develop on all crypto subreddits as the price continues to plummet.
"This is just a 10% correction, it'll be back up any second now"  
"This 20% drop is because Roger Ver. But it's over"  
"This 35% drop just means it's a great time to buy"  
Just wait for:  
"It may be down 75% but it's still technically up 20% from 2014, so relax!"  
"Who cares about a 95% drop? I bought BTC when it was $1 anyways. What, you didn't?"  
"99% is a correction"  
"The good news about BTC going down 100% is that you can't lose any more and there's no reason NOT to hodl now."

Ah yeah I just noticed Coinbase will let me add a CC for payment if I so desire. Buuuuut yeah not only are there the risks you mentioned, but running the balance up would hurt my credit score even if nothing else bad happened.  
Ironically I'm not willing to make that gamble with an $8,000 line of credit, yet I would absolutely be willing to make that gamble with a six figure loan if I had a chance in hell of getting approved for one (I wouldn't). Go ahead, hate.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:36:54
I happen to monitor my credit score somewhat closely and it's a fickle bastard that will drop seemingly at random and then I'm advised to do everything perfectly for six straight months if I want to see it go back from Good to Excellent. And then it randomly goes down again.  
At any rate, sacrificing credit score to max out my CC on less than 0.5 BTC probably wouldn't be worth it, but if I could get a six digit loan then I won't give a fuck what my score is since I'll already be in Lambo country.

96%, and at a rate of about 0.9% loss per year between 1913 and 2019, I'd say that's a lot more stable than Bitcoin which rarely goes more than a month without its value changing 10-25%.
People know they shouldn't *spend* a currency that might double in value in less than a year, and vendors/businesses know they shouldn't *accept* a currency that might half in value in less than a year. Everyone still laughs at the guy who bought a pizza for 10,000 BTC. Haha what a fucking idiot, using a currency like an actual currency. Just goes to show even BTC adopters deep down know it fluctuates too much to be a currency and if it ever actually held its value steady like a good currency should, the interest in it would plummet because nobody gets to live out their get-rich-quick dreams anymore.

Started buying at 5k in 2017, was about 10k in the green before the crash in December 2017. Cashed out with a 4k loss in mid 2018. Swore I'd never invest in BTC again even if it looks like it's going up. I saw it hit as low as 3k after I cashed out and was content with my decision. Now, though...
Let's just say if it crashes again I'm back in. But you do realize it will never be a serious currency if its value remains this volatile, right?

Wouldn't adoption of bitcoin as a mainstream currency be the death of bitcoin as an investment? Hypothetically, if my US dollars were going up in value by 1-8% each day like BTC is, I wouldn't spend it like currency, I'd want to hoard it, and resort to old-fashioned bartering for goods and services. Why would I want to *spend* 15 USD for a pizza if there's a good chance that a year later that 15 USD could buy a car? I feel like a basic requirement for people to spend currency is being confident that they won't regret parting with it. In other words its value needs to stay put as much as possible.

Thinking it's too late is why I don't have $200k+ net worth right now.  
When bitcoin hit $1,000 I thought it was too late. No way it could get much higher than that. The idea of one unit of a currency being worth $1,000 was absurd to me.  
And I thought the same when it hit $3,000.  
And $4,000.  
And I almost *ALMOST* said it again when it hit $5,000 but I said fuck it, let's try this.  
I've had BTC for 40 days and already made $2,000. Not buying a Tesla anytime soon, but you can't argue that my money is working wayyyyyyy harder in BTC than it ever would in a savings account, CD, etc.

"But guys, we're *still* up from [checks BTC price history] October! It's an upward trend!"  
Next month you'll be telling us we're still up from last June. Then last March, etc.

There's speculation and then there's adorably wishful thinking. It's like the millions of children who, at one point, said they're going to be astronauts. You just kinda want to rub their heads and say "Aww, isn't that sweet"

I'm not really saying I should have went all in on bitcoin when it was brand new. I don't think anyone can blame someone for being a skeptic when bitcoin was dirt cheap. What I'm saying is I had so many opportunities to drop my skepticism while bitcoin was strongly *and* steadily climbing right in front of my face, but chose not to. I think that is a real lapse in good judgment, whereas initial skepticism is perfectly understandable.

I am actually really wanting to start today. Buuuut I'm also in the middle of this divorce and I have to check with my lawyer if investing a significant amount right now would look suspicious since I've already disclosed my finances.

It's like every day at my work. No matter what, the last 8-16 hours are shrouded in mystery.

Touché. When it was at $1,000 I was like "How can a single unit of currency be worth that much, surely it can't go higher. It's probably all downhill from here."

Does anyone else who missed out on the bitcoin gold rush feel sick to their stomachs realizing just how much money they missed out on?  
I knew about bitcoin back when it was &lt;$50 per bitcoin. When it reached $100 I strongly considered investing. [Ex-]wife talked me out of it. I basically ignored bitcoin until I saw an article saying it reached $1,000. I could have invested then but I thought "No, that's a ludicrous amount of money for a single unit of currency, surely it couldn't get much higher than that". I said the same thing each time it hit another milestone. I finally started investing four days ago, but I'm only up to 0.25 BTC. I get sick to my stomach thinking how much I could have right now if I just invested the same amount 5 years ago, or even 1 year ago. I know it's useless to think about it, but I can't help it.

I don't know if you've been paying attention but it's clearly not done going down.

For what it's worth I'd happily exchange some tomatoes, toilet paper, hot pockets, etc. for a bar of gold.

“Bitcoin will go down/stagnate” is FOMO but “Bitcoin will go way way up” is gospel, love it.
