Buy a miner and join a mining pool. You can get a basic miner for under $100 these days. It won't make you rich, but it'll familiarize you with the process in an affordable way:

reddit has the ability to do this with a built in wiki. Lots of subreddits use it.

Or, ditch the sticky altogether and keep the FAQ link in sidebar. There's no reason to use the most valuable part of the page in this way.

Hi Mick. When I tried to buy bitcoin from your company, the website said it would take just a few days to complete the order. Those coins were delivered on time.
So I bought more coins from time to time, probably 20 purchases in all. Every single order was completed on time.
Well, I felt like I could trust Coinbase, so I signed up for instant buy. And that's when it happened, Mick. Ever since I did that, my orders have been delivered in a few seconds, not a few days. 
Sometimes I think about posting on the forums so the whole world will know what my experience with coinbse has been like -- reliable, convenient, and quite satisfactory.
As with reddit, ycombinator chose wisely.

The daily thread would be a much better sticky post than the current 9 month old FAQ thread, which is so old we can't comment or vote there anymore.
