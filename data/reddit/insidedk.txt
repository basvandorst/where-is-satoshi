And what do you base that assumption on? That this was it. Crypto is now a thing of the past and will never go higher?

This is why so many governments and banks does not support bitcoin. We need these vertifications to make sure that the money does not come from money laundering. So just send in your ID and you are good to go.

As a Dane / EU citizen I can recommend bitstamp. However remember that the validation process can take a long time so better hurry up and make a account now, otherwise you will not have enough days to transfer funds from your bank account to your bitstamp account before the holiday (I think it will be too late now). You can deposit from credit card also, but it has a VERY high fee, so I do not recommend that.
They use SEPA bank transfer, so it takes 1-3 days to get money in and 1-3 days to get money out again.
