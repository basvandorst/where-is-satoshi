the military force of the US government. While I do think bitcoin is more than just magic internet monies, saying nothing is backing the US dollar is just not true. Its backed by the power of the government to make people and nations accept it as legal tender.

I'm sorry, I don't know much of the technical or programming side behind it. I used to mine for deepbit using GUIminer and I remember that you would put in a location for it to submit hashes, decide what portion of your GPU(s) could be used and when you activated it, it would report your hashes to (in my case, deepbit).
This was back before ASIC miners when having a couple hundred Mhash/s like shown in the picture could theoretically net you one successful solo block every couple months given 100% uptime.

ah, ok, I've never used it so i was confused about the double transaction. it seems weird to me but at least the numbers added up.

when pool mining was common, you used to earn a fraction of a Bitcoin paid out by the pool based on either or hash rate contribution anytime a new block was mined, or some paid higher if you only took a payout when the block was actually successfully mined to that pool.

euro has decimal currency as well and afaik it is also called cents as its a 1/100 euro. so 4 euro cents is still 4 cents.

especially in a colder climate. I have to take my gloves off to change the temp and heat/air mode in my car. When its 40 below that's not something i really want to be doing. I shouldnt have to buy special gloves just to use my temp control

this is my life right now. I have two old 2gb GTX 660s that i bought in 2012 and they still benchmark higher than anything else i can find for under $800. I just built a new desktop with all Q4 2017 parts and im stuck using Q1 2012 graphics cards. Thats insane

From what I was reading earlier after he's met the USD value needed to payout at 2013 rates, he gets to keep the remaining BTC to himself as the debtor gets to keep any appreciated assets. 
Normally bankruptcy assets don't appreciate and a gain never happens but in this case it's a huge chunk. some predicted it to be as high as 180k BTC will remain after satisfying the $$ amount required to payout

so depending on the time of day, either $5000 or $2000, quite the range.
