@_date: 2013-12-06 00:14:39
how do cash deals work?
im in the midlands, but id be happy to do that!
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:07:32
i'd still rather get rid myself... where can i sell them for about £200 each, so i can make a little profit?
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:59:53
ive checked the amount. 10BTC for 1500gbp
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:02:58
which is my point, but its all now in my account. which is the thing that im finding difficulty with
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:09:18
so to do that i go on my new wallet 
then sign up to localbitcoins, then sell for £200 each.. sounds easy enough. if that is under market value then i guess i should offer it on here first to the people who have helped me out. and the community that i enjoy

drug money is illegal money, doesnt the same apply to bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:59:33

@_date: 2013-12-06 00:06:09
my friend, and to be honest. i'll sell mine; this whole thing is pissing me off majorly. im thinking ill just cut my losses and get out
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:18:34
holy shit, my inbox has gone off. sure, if you want?
how do we do this?
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:10:38
more like - im happy to move them on so that they are someone elses problem.
not give them away, at the end of the day, it still cost me 1500
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:00:01
see above
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:06:24
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:06:54
already did that 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:19:20
reversed how?
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:29:17
holy shit! sounds pretty dodgy to me!
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:00:51
i know how much there is, and how much i bought it for. i just dont know how he came about aquiring it. as he takes drugs and i heard people bought them online, so he could very well have been selling them online with the amount i saw in his house the other day
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:30:21
its in bold so it must be true.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:22:28
when the market jumped, yeah
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:21:11
pizza. now that is an idea. if they really are worth 7000 then thats a shed load of pizza
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:02:09
theyre transferred, its just that they may have been obtained by drugs etc, im not too sure how it works to be honest. i just feel like i have these coins that i can do nothing with because i dont know how. just looking to get rid of them really.
maybe not send them for nothing though - nice try
