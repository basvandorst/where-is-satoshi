Ahh ok.

And it is not banned, just banks can't use it. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:46:46
Or it is a friend or old gay lover. Or perhaps it was a government agent that paid him to use his name! /s To be fair it does not really mater if it is him or not to Bitcoin.

ASICs only do sha256 calculations, so other than hashing there is not much use.
@_date: 2014-02-08 08:52:07
My Gox,  BTC prices falling after. Etc 
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:32:11
WA seems more like. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:32:47
Silkroad was also part of the story. I am really not sure where I was going with that but it was somewhere...
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:50:32
Get more games that previously thought? 
@_date: 2014-05-13 23:15:34
Call me crazy, but would it not make some sense and be cool in the case of Scottish independence if they went to crypto instead of the pound?

I don't think many people understand how big data analysis works in relation to protocols related to that project. But if one thinks that they are safe to use such tools from US government entities they are dearly misguided. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 03:28:59
Nor can I. But it still presents a unique opportunity. At the very least as a mind exercise it would make for quite interesting times.
@_date: 2014-03-22 06:44:48
I have been thinking the same, and would like to hear your reasoning. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:38:38
Like north korea?
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:36:44
Ah, thanks. But is that not the same thing Russia did?
@_date: 2014-04-22 23:58:15
Well, it did use a form of English.

I was idling in irc, forget where, and some random dude was telling about how the Byzantine Generals problem was solved with this thing called Bitcoin. I looked into it, mined a some blocks with my single core CPU, then forgot about it as I was working my way through school. I later formatted and lost that HDD. Then last November happened and I heard about it on the news... fuck me sideways. Anyway as a now broke graduate I am looking into starting a BTC company. But this IRS thing just put a gigantic crimp in my business plans. Sry for the long rant on my phone about to sleep before judging kids tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:46:10
I forgot about bitcoin, I mined it on a whim with my cpu back when satoshi was still around, lost that HDD, forgot about it as "real life" got in the way, then bam look around and each BTC is over 100 USD... Damn I wish I did not loose that HDD...
Edit: Or stop mining...
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:35:09
Also when you "sell" your property for goods, such as a cup of coffee. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 03:59:14
I also use it all the time! Super useful.
@_date: 2014-02-02 00:19:39
I'm right there with you. Did CPU mining before pools/GPU. Wish I could find that HDD or even one of my backup wallets...

But as far as TOR, developed by the DOD, goes there is no guarantee that the NSA does not have it cracked, or that they control enough nodes to be able to use big data to figure out who is who. It is just a slight assistance in possibly avoiding that eventuality. However the NSA will still store the encrypted traffic and once they have cracked the method it will be read. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 00:20:34
Or a page could be taken from political nomenclature and call it the exact opposite of what it is. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:20:43
Robbery. Kidnapping. etc.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:11:04
I'm kind of looking forward to number three.
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:12:19
Which event? I am somewhat behind right now on the different events. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:43:39
@_date: 2014-10-03 00:01:33
The non lawyer. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:28:39
But other than the amount of BTC there, what do they mater for? There are people watching the addresses all the time so nobody could move any without an uproar. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 04:17:50
The butt, not his personal butt.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:22:31
I have been under a rock, DPR?
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:46:33
Transaction fees, and ASICS whittle else to do. But don't worry, you and all of us will be dead by then. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:41:07
So, would that not fall under the silk road point?
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:18:55
I was not saying the reason that because it was a DOD project it IS cracked. Just that that needs to be kept in mind when objectively looking at the situation. 
Also, with the internet keeping the fact that it was a DARPA project in mind we can understand why there was never any need to keep communications secret, after all why bother hiding senders and receivers when you already knew everyone on the network.

The Fat Hobbit is rather nice when you talk with him. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:51:23
Burn the router? 
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:09:27
I hear that it sounds a bit like German, French, or Italian depending on where you live. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:49:20
I may have been a tad druink and not paying attn. also i FINALLY KNOW MY GOD DAMN CAKEDAY.... fucking hell never remembered it.
@_date: 2014-09-04 05:48:01
This was what I remembered too.

I volunteer as an impartial judge to determine which chef reigns supreme.

That is a 300% ROI, nothing to scoff at!

The NSA certainly will, he'll they likely will use it as an excuse to further their surveillance.
