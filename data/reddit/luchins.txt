Is there any way to protect  a seller  from being scammed?
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:09:13
Ok,  esxcuse.
You are right, if any adoption the liquidity would be high, so no more drastic price volatili..  but  explain to me   why  one person  should make FIAT --&gt;  Bitcoin --&gt;  on line  purchase.

What  about  price  stability?  How  can you  have a   ''store  of value''  if the price  drops?

You are  assuming that  there  will be trade wars, financial crisis ..    how can you be sure  about  this?
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:52:52
your position is  that there will be  a  financial  crisis, but you can't  be sure about it.  Anyway if  the light network will work Bitcoin could  be adopted, but it's  a BIG IF. Is The core bitcoin  working  hard  on bitcoin?

If you send  to the  wrong address, funds  are lost  FOREVER...  yes,  keep on thinking that is better than Paypal

Thank you for the information.
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:34:41
Where  did  you take  those?  From which  website?
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:24:57


A buyer  sends  the funds ---&gt;  seller  keeps the money    sending a fake/broken  product.
In this  case Paypale  would have protected  the buyer

I am not spreading  fud,  I also  want that  bitcoin to succeed. But you have  to be honest. Lightning network   it's centralized

what is the meaning of this sorry? Can you do an example of ''if you have funds stored in an addresses that has already been spent once (reused)'' What is the meaning of reused here?
I have an on line Coinbase wallet. I have my bitcoin address... I send two times the funds to that address in 3 months. How can attacer get the private key?
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:36:10
With   bitcoin  1 million  in price, will the transactions  fees (with  the Lightening network implemented) still cost the same  as they cost  today?

I have red that  they can easly  solve this problem with quantum resitance
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:20:52


Sorry for my question but how can I get  a new address each time from Coinbase online wallets? They are all fixed addresses
@_date: 2019-10-26 16:52:03
----Well I don't know if I can reword it. Ideally addresses should always be single use. 
Is  this  somenthing I should already  be  worried about  now or in a couple of years?
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:26:23
Thank you  for your answers


what does this mean, sorry? could you explain in a simpler  way? sacrifice liquidity of what?
Why  people  with a  lot of money  are the more likely to  route channels  and to  act like ''routers'' ?
More money = more chances  to act like a ''router'' which instrades transactions?  Why?

Bitcoin is freedom, so you have to contend with Alice's freedom. If Alice wants you to pay her over Lightning, that's what you use. If Alice wants you to pay her over the base Bitcoin blockchain, that's what you use. If Alice couldn't care less either way, then you pick whatever is most convenient to you
Thank you.  Can I ask what is  the scaling  approach of  the  bitcoin's  ''competitors''  such as  bitcoin  cash?  Bitcoin has LN, then Bitcoin cash  how  will it manage to scale?

I  want  to buy a coffe.
The bar owner  set  a  fee  ridicolous high.
How  do I  bypass  this with another  channel?
Thank you
One other question:  why   do they say that  the LN will make Bitcoin ''more  centralized'' ?  Where  does this  comes  from?
Thank you very much  for  your  answers

What if they decide to charge an astronimical ammount for a fee?
As I have understood they set the price fee, isn't it?
