The S9’s 16 Nanometer Technological Advantage
The on-going miniaturisation of semiconductors allows ever greater computing power and electrical efficiency, but the process cannot continue forever with the current technology. Many have remarked that Moore’s law no longer holds true, as the rate of computing speed advancement has slowed as it reaches the physical limitations of silicon semiconductor technology.
The 16 nm fabrication process used in the manufacture of the S9 is a major improvement upon the 28 nm design common to other modern mining devices. Although a 10nm process is on the horizon for 2017, further increases beyond that remain theoretical. Further, the design and manufacture of any 10nm Bitcoin mining hardware is likely to take at least a year.
Power Supply
The good news is that existing power supplies, at least those of sufficient wattage, are fully compatible with the S9.
Recommended for use with the S9 are:
    The AntMiner APW-12 1600 Watt Bitcoin Miner PSU, which retails for just under $200 on Amazon, and
    The EVGA SuperNOVA 1300 Watt GPU PSU , which sells for about $170 on Amazon. Note that the 1600 Watt EVGA PSU is significantly more expensive, by about $115, than Ant Miner’s equivalently-powered offering.
Bitcoins / Month (Profitability)
The S9 has more hashing power than any previous device crammed into its silicon; a massive 14 TH/s (TeraHash per second). A total of 189 chips, spread over 3 circuit boards, are combined to achieve this phenomenal hashrate. Excluding a 15 brief TH/s spike which occurred late 2011, a single S9 unit boasts a hashrate equivalent to the peak capacity of the entire Bitcoin network from its bootstrapping until mid-2012!
