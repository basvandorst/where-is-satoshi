CoinBase does not commit fraud, so that argument is meaningless.

If you solo mine, you have the chance at solving a block, but this is a high risk and not likely. 
If you mine in a pool, consistent payouts will be achievable, but as far as mining a coin, you will not. You will be receiving fractions block rewards which typically amounts to very small portions of BTC.

Increased Liquidity --&gt; Increased Volatility in general trends.
Increased Liquidity is indicative of decreased market confidence. 
Example: Bitcoin prices ^, people sell to profit. If they believed the price would continue to rise past 'x' to 'X' then they would not sell @ *current*. This is the definition of decreased confidence. This is not saying that confidence @ 'x' is less, it's merely less at 'X'. When confidence outweighs potential losses, people hold, but when risk outweighs confidence, you see sells to capitalize on gains.

Sounds like somebody didn't make much or lost a lot.

I wish the worst of luck to you, OP. I hope Wall Street fails. Jump out the office window already.

I'm just being honest. I don't care that some brokers may have been okay people, but there were okay people that were just doing jobs for the Nazis too. The system is corrupt and I want to see it collapse.

I didn't ask for the money, she did, and they are obligated to give her the money, but the tried to act otherwise.

Satoshi very well may have died in the 5 years since. There's no evidence otherwise.

Once again, this is an invalid argument. Moral condemnation does not imply lack of profitability. Robbing people is very lucrative, but is not something I will partake in. I will continue to earn my money in the crypto world using sound tactics that are not mimicking the issues the current system has perpetuated. 
Unlike you, I do not laugh on my way to the bank as I am not crazy, but you are welcome to get weird stares if you would like.

Arguing that the act of those trading practices as a joke is not the same as your argument that the creation of software easing these practices is profitable. These are not arguments against each other. 
It seems you are confusing moral condemnation with profitability advice.
U Jelly?

I'm honestly not trolling, but as an user of your service trafering a few thousand dollars in/out with your service a month and sometimes even in a week, I have to say I hope your business suffers. This is a inconvenience such that your service is becoming worthless to anybody that needs more than 1 BTC quickly. I'm better off consolodating my purchases into even larger ones and doing the wire transfer myself and get better BTC prices. 
tl;dr *insert anger* 
tl;dr You are greedy.

I had no issue doing this. I maxed out the amount allowed at $78 too. I've only purchased once through that method though.

I disagree 100% with OP. 
The facts are that the gift is free to the person receiving it. The gift is about as useful as gold bullion to the average person, which is just as valued as the informed if they choose to become educated.
The gift is sincere in the fact that the gifter is giving the giftee the opportunity in a stake of investment. Many gold coins have been lost through the years and many BTC will too. Those commodities in the correct hands is the best gift of all, but in hands of the careless, they are worthless. 
It's their choice to use the gift or not. The brother did the best thing--teach a man to fish. OP is lazy and just wants the fish.

He gave gifts of value. Get over yourself and be gracious for the gift.

I personally was considering giving my family all gifts of crypto, but I figured the hassel to teach them would be too great. I wanted to offer them a piece of something that could be worth a lot one day. They were all amazed at my story of recentlly making about $3k. 
I chose to not give the gift. The gift was not for my enjoyment. It was going to be for theirs, but I am lazy and said fuck it, don't care. 
No gift is selfish. You are once again wrong. Gifts do not have to be thoughtful in the other person's eyes, only the one giving it. To make a gift worthwhile, it should be seen at equal or greater value to the receiver otherwise you aren't gifting efficiently.
