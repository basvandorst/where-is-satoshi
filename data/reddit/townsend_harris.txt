My DMV had an electronic line as far back as the late 1990s. Walk in, select service, wait for service. It took some time but it wasn't as bad as standing in line. 
Russians pull feats like what people in other countries do for iPhones to make sure their kids get into school...

And yet people relate that to value...bitcoin doesn't have any value beyond perception, just like the dollar (or any other currency in the world today). 
These days with instant currency conversions and electronic banking, I can buy anything for almost any currency that I want to.

How is bitcoin NOT a fiat currency?

As far as I know, Bitcoins can be mined forever as well (i.e. there is a potentially limitless supply) although the rate at which they appear is slowed.

An American diplomats son was caned back in the 1990s for vandalizing some cars there I think.

I was referring to the 


* money without intrinsic value
definitions (as per wikipedia) =). 
If you remove the 'state-issued' part from the definition, it looks like (to me at least) that bitcoins have more in common with the dollar/other currency than it has not in common with them. 
Also lots of the Russians I teach are comparing Bitcoins to [MMM]( Now while I point out to them that MMM had direct beneficiaries and Bitcoins don't appear to (and likely don't). But the people telling me this know way more about economics than I do so I feel the need to ask around about it.
