This is awesome, but how is it that useful if you had to change it for another currency? I mean, don't get me wrong, I do that too, but I don't think this makes it "useful".

Great info! Thank you

Anyway, in the end the price will go up. I'm not saying that TA will work for everyone to have a profit with it, but to "predict" a future price increase.

TA will start working as soon as most people believe in TA. Think about it.
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:36:52
That's not I meant. I mean like, in a very simple way, if most people are waiting to buy at the exact same time, it will go up for sure, even if it's only for a moment. I'm talking about MOST people, and I really mean MOST people.

Thanks a lot for your answer, I didn't know about the ones you mentioned. I'm going to check them out right now. Do you know if they have ads for non-english speakers?
