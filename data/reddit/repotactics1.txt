Keep their feed open and tweet at them repeatedly after there’s activity on their feed.

Tweet at them... I had the same issue and after tweeting at them repeatedly they resolved it quickly.

how is it more centralized? Over 70% of the hash rate for Bitcoin Core comes from China if anything

Just curious what has he done for Bitcoin? I know nothing about the man just see a lot of praise.

Bitcoin is inflationary up until it reaches 21 million coins mined which will never be in our lifetime. Bitcoin has an inflation rate that will stay somewhat constant up until around 2020 when the “halvening” occurs and the amount of bitcoins rewarded to the miners drops. As far as fiat currencies go, whenever the FED injects money into the economy using monetary policy that can cause inflation based on a number of factors that I won’t dive into. Bitcoin in a way is being “injected” with new coins every day up until that 21 millionth coin is mined. Bitcoin is not currently deflationary unless the number of coins circulating continued to go down (which could happen if mass amounts of bitcoin were lost as we’ve seen in the past).

Correlation not causation. Nothing to see here other than the waning interest of Bitcoin. Everything moves in cycles. Soon price will stop going down and interest will rebound. With that, the reddit posts will increase.

Thanks! Do we know how the lightning network is progressing? I am just curious whether the time frame we're looking at is closer to 1 month or 1 year.

Yes but what if they attacked the network again after the following difficulty adjustment? Because we will see an increase in Hash rate, the difficulty should go up again in the following difficulty adjustment. This would be an opportune time for them to strike again. Last time they attacked, the hash rate for BCH was greater than Bitcoin at one point. With BCH's new algorithm, I am scared for a future attack as they fixed the problem of the mining difficulty being too hard or too easy.

I would not be surprised if they sold enough BCH to where they either broke even after doing the attack or made a profit. I agree it would be way smarter for them to work on their project and leave core alone, but it's clear they want to take over Bitcoin. I sincerely hope we don't see another attack like this.
