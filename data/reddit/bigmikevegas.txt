This is why I always tip cash, or BTC if applicable.  This unfortunetly is a standard merchant service fee for a single credit card transaction, my business I run gets charged the same thing, although I would look into the dipping into the tips part, I am not sure if that is legit or not, to me it sounds like he's letting your tip take the blow from the merchant service fee.

As someone who runs a small business, I couldn't agree more.  I had a customer ask for a charge back on some landscape and tree service, who paid for the job upon completion and was satisfied, then had the nerve to say we did a bad job remove 3 trees from his yard.  I write the letter to the CC company, who held $2500 from my company.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  Put the trees back in the ground they way they were?  TLDR it took about 2 months for them to put the money back in our account after multiple letters and phone calls for a customer who I am assuming charges back a TON of stuff.  People suck.
