I hear a lot of people saying that it's convenient for small amount of Bitcoin and repeated payment... But it's really a misleading argument.
The main problem of Lightning Network is that it's not solving the main issue of Bitcoin for using it as an everyday money : its fixed supply over time. Would you use small piece of gold to pay your coffee ? No, and it's exactly the function of LN, it cuts for you these small pieces in a convenient way (no fees and fast).
The idea of LN is fundamentally wrong because it has been built by geeks that have no understanding of Economy and how a money works. And i'm very sorry for all these people that spent an insane amount of time and money on this, I'm pretty sure it will never be used on a big scale.

Well, you just described the intrinsic value of the Bitcoin Network, not the Bitcoin itself ! It's like saying the worlwide installations of gold (including market, transport, custodial) are its intrinsic value.
The truth is, we still don't know what really is the intrinsic value of Bitcoin.

making the same mistake again and again... End of 2017 was not enough.

It's like we are preparing ourselves to a post apocalyptique world. We all know it's coming soon.

So it's exactly like fiat money.

The only "true" SPV Wallet on IOS is Bread Wallet, the others use API to broadcast transactions. It's good to know since,  they all have a single point of failure, allowing transaction malleability.

The more people say we have hit the bottom, the more you have to sell ASAP. It's an indicator that never fail.

Litecoin is IMHO, ultra underrated. This chart show something important : an old and stable Blockchain is perhaps the most valuable thing in cryptocurrency. Litecoin has that, more than all others (except Bitcoin).

Unfortunately, the probability of losing your bitcoins is much higher outside Coinbase. It's a major issue that still to be solved in the crypto space, the way of storing crypto currencies is not adapted to common people.

I've tried to be a bit all of them... and it turns out that Hodl is much more profitable for bitcoin because of its very chaotic short term moves.
I'm up 10% now, would have been around 50% if I had just kept my position.

That offers a new incentive for robbers to cut your arm with a machete.

People still don't understand the main advantage of Bitcoin : storing value with censorship resistance. It's not meant to be an everyday money, use Fiat for this it's perfect. For buying your groceries or get paid, you need something stable. 
So if you are moving a portion of your saving: 
1) It will not occur everyday 
2) You are likely to accept paying higher fees for it.

I know it because I've studied all the open source wallets to build one myself. This is the kind of information you don't know otherwise.
The big problem with true SPV, they have to download all blocks header from connected nodes at the set up. It's a very long process, and it's not at all user friendly. They almost all solved the problem by using API, like Mycelium (they have their own API, but others use [Blockchain.com]( for example). Believe it or not, but these wallets are not at all P2P.

I would love that the inventor of the most disruptive technology of the century was from japan, but it's probably not the case.

It's probably for promoting a new shit coin... Who would want to give 1M$ (plus cost to build the game) like that ?
@_date: 2019-04-18 07:41:32
2011, my brother sent me and email saying "Hey do you know about Bitcoin ? It's 10$ right now, you should buy some, it looks promising"
Of course I never followed his advice.

He is probably millionaire now and doesn't need to work anymore.

it's always the same story again and again. People are happy with the "get rich quick" gains, then they buy more, then they get rekt.
Reddit looks like end of 2017 right now.

BTC never do what people think it will. If there is a consensus for 10k, we are probably at the end of this sucker rally.

I don't know why Peter is constantly bashed by bitcoin activists. All his arguments are pretty good and should be discussed.
The price of bitcoin is basically a Ponzi scheme. You have phase of accumulations, early accumulators get paid, and last to enter get REKT. It's 100% speculation, the only reason why bitcoin keep rising is because people still think they can sell it for more they paid it. You'll never buy something with bitcoins for various reason, ultimately you want to convert it with good old fiat for buying your lambo or whatever.
And i'm playing this game too, but i'm aware of this...
