Huge spike at the moment on GDAX!
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:51:04
D'oh! Big orange candles now.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:08:14
Aaaaaaand it's gone.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:02:35
Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop taking amphetamines.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:48:19
Incoming! Big green candles!
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:15:36
New peak incoming since the drop 17 hours ago.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:08:36
Do note that it's not in real-time. I've noticed the figures are sometimes out of sync by around 30-60 secs which can be make or break.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:50:25
C'mon! Why won't it break through $9,900?!?
EDIT: Just did it. 10k back in spitting distance.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:48:44
Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit smoking. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:05:09
I don't wanna jinx it but things are looking pretty stable right now.
Any more timezones remaining for further FUD-DUMPS ?
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:09:36
It's already the arvo there so I think they're done.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:42:49
The world is not the way it used to be, no no no

Coinbase allows you to set alerts. I'm also using an Android Widget called Bitcoin Ticker Widget for which you can set up a plethora of alerts.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:10:16
We've now had 4 or 5 HUGE dips. How can you be so confident it's going to bounce back?
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:42:36
Holy hell! $9650 on GDAX.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:17:02
It's not giving up without a fight. I'll give it that.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:42:42
I take it back. We're still pumping. 
$500 away from $12k.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:31:37
Ditto. It's just mentally relaxing to have steady growth. With insane rallies you have to always prep yourself psychologically for the inevitable drop.

As long as he didn't make that statement at the Fyre Festival.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:08:41
Before attacking me, why not offer a counter-argument of your own?
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:33:16
So far they're doing well. Good discipline after that initial dump.
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:44:54
Bitcoin Ticker Widget: 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:45:21
Only on the way down. Observing on the way up is strangely invigorating ;)
$7,500+ now.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:33:09
Looking at the chart, I'm wondering if $11k was our new peak this time and we're going to drop down to $8k before starting the rally again. It just feels strangely similar to the $19k drop.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:21:47
Seems to be recovering...
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:00:10
They've taken the scam to the next level by having responders.
Someone's definitely going to fall for this.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:02:01
Bodybangers? WTF! Technotronic, man. ;)
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:01:51
Would you rather I suggest investing in something that's clearly tanking?
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:15:41
I guess the problem is all of us, huh.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:26:01
The question on everyone's mind: But will she hold?
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:57:53
Agreed. The barrier is broken and now we HODL until the end.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:10:54
I admire everyone still sticking in this game. If you bought around $3,000, your profits are decent and you can still get out fairly ok. If you bought in at anything over $9,000, all you can do is pray. The downward trend suggests it's not going to get better anytime soon and even if cryptocurrency isn't a bubble, the governments and regulators all seem to be making damn sure it turns into one.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:13:36
Haha! Can you blame anyone? This is the only way to not get burnt.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:31:07
Here's another one and this guy also doesn't seem to have any arms or legs. I'm betting they're tucked in: 
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:52:04
The Bitcoin Hate-Brigade in the office has been strangely quiet these past two days. I wonder why? :D
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:36:14
And did you notice he got the origin right? He didn't publicize it as that "hold on for dear life" bullshit.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:43:18
Could this actually be a legitimate bullrun? I'm cautiously optimistic but hopeful that it lasts at least another hour.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:51:35
Sell it, set up a loud vibrating alert on your phone for when it's gone up a certain percentage (5% maybe?) and then buy back in if it happens. Personally, I think it'll go even lower this morning.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:50:56
South Korea should be waking up around now. How is this going to go? Mass dump or resurrection? Place your bets, gentlemen.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:41:56
This one's even better: 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:43:54
That is very true but bear in mind that investors tend to operate like sheep. If the upward trend is well defined, stable and you can see proof of it overcoming previous hurdles, odds are in your favour that it will have a bit of longevity. I'm merely suggesting to weigh up the odds before parting with your penny.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:15:28
Over $7200 now.
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:27:41
Laugher. Larry Laugher.

GDAX volume looking pretty sweet right now.

When moon?
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:44:58
Calm down, buddy. T'was but a curious question. 
Not trying to panic anyone.
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:55:34
If it makes it up to $18k (I doubt it'll happen but hope to be proven wrong) expect an enormous sell-off just shortly before. Fool me once, shame on you, etc etc...
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:40:11
Looks like my Stop Order's about to be triggered. Well, shit. We'll fight another day BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-19 00:18:25
Never ever regret this. If it went the other way, you would've been kicking yourself. Finding the middle ground is safer and you'll realise better, more consistent profits in the long run.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:04:29
Was the first line of your explanation a typo (re: green) ?
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:09:12
I would be impressed if that actually happens. The volatility surely comes into question.

When was the last time we closed higher then we started?
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:17:23
I don't think it was a co-ordinated bulltrap. My opinion is that there was optimism tonight but at some point people just got nervous that the price wasn't rising, and then it quickly escalated into a game of hot potato. 
Confidence is still low. Give it time.
Mind you, this might not be over just yet - for tonight anyway - but it's a dangerous game.
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:15:32
Get your 10k memes ready!
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:45:43
Gotta admit - I'm kinda blown away by this recovery. I'm ashamed to admit it but I'd called BTC's time of death earlier today.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:18:25
Lol, compared to 6 times, yes.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:24:10
$7,300 now. Volume still good too.
Eeek! 116 BTC SELL order.
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:07:47
I agree. I'm out for now. I may lose out if it does end up going up tonight but at least I'll be able to sleep at night knowing I'm safe.
The market is clearly still very nervous.
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:30:34
It's really going for it tonight, huh! Love it!
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:37:14
Ah yes! How could I forget. I bought into that and lost a ton.
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:52:52
It's climbing again. 
People, you gotsta gotsta have faith!

Great. We're practically right back where we started this morning. 
However, good news for anyone who missed the take-off this morning and wanted to buy in. Here's your second chance, guys.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:10:55
SEC hearing gave it some legs?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:21:42
Do not buy another cent until you see a stable upward trend.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:04:36
It's at $7,200 and the book volume is still high! There's a big 100 BTC Sell order coming through but there's a lot of support in the buy.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:45:59
Nah, I haven't been discussing my holdings. The Bitcoin haters are just naturally loud &amp; obnoxious and sometimes you just instinctively feel the need to stick up for the technology. However, this has been a tad bit difficult during the past 2 months.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:48:57
So? If I don't post a "Moon!" comment, I automatically deserve punishment?

I've never ever seen GDAX bounce from $8400 to $8870 in barely 2 minutes.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:01:30
I never lost sight of us being in a bear channel - it's my greed &amp; FOMO that drove me towards acquiring short term gains with the intention of bailing at the end of each run. Lesson learnt: if you're not in it for the long term, it's not worth the risk because it probably won't go your way.
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:23:57
So you're saying is that it'll be priced in Fiat currency but when it comes time to pay, it'll compute the equivalent in terms of BTC and allow you you to pay with that. I was thinking it would be priced in BTC but you're right, that wouldn't make sense.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:45:03
Do you have any thoughts or an opinion? Or are you just a painfully unbearable douche?
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:13:35
On GDAX, you don't pay any fees when using Limit Orders.

Take your measly profits, you vultures!
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:58:14
If you're on GDAX, you can monitor the upcoming soldiers prepping for battle. Some will drop out seconds before the battle, others will jump in earlier. It's like playing an RTS game without having any control whatsoever (except the ability to retreat).

From their website: GDAX currently operates in the US, Europe, UK, Canada, Australia and Singapore.

Three times now I've gone back in when it looked bullish and three times the price has dropped $1,500 within 24 hours.
I'm out. 
Good luck to all of you guys.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:33:19
I believe in it just as much as you do but I'm not prepared to lose all my money if the masses aren't willing to buy into it as well. It's too risky right now to go all in imho.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:24:45
This was posted 7 months ago and it wasn't accurate back then either. Any reason we should trust it now?
