I'm not sure I completely understand the answer to that [last question]( that almost stumped Andreas.  
I think Andreas says that hardened keys cap a branch of the tree, but looking at BIP32, it doesn't seem to be that way.  The last part of the [Implications section]( says they were used at the account level to prevent a leak of an account or below private key from compromising the keys of other accounts or even the master.  That seems to go with what Andreas was saying, but the accounts level is not capped at all, if you check out the [diagram]( that section was referring to.
Long story short, anybody know any good material that re-explains the differences between hardened and non-hardened keys?  Seems like they're pretty important for preventing what seems like a small leak from being a leak of, say, all private keys a company has ever used for all of their users.

Depending on traffic, it can be like 60-70 minutes 90 of Seattle.  Are you going?

In all seriousness, I hear it's very good- people come from across the world to present at it.  It's kind of mind-blowingly great for a small town.  I live in that small town.  I'm going.

Totally a transitional tool because it'll be years before most merchants accept bitcoin with a custom bitcoin-accepting system they have to pay for and then merge with their fiat currency accounting system.

Thank you.
I actually did search google and this subreddit for an answer and didn't see one on either front page of search results.  What terms are you using?

Banking bail-out institutionalized: deposits and pensions will be seized in the event of a bailout, megabanks due to merge.

Someone tell this woman about Bitcoin!

I've been ordering from these guys for years and they've always given me white glove treatment, even when I showed up at their warehouse thinking it was their store front! I highly recommend [Honey Berries e-juice!]( It's my favorite flavor from any of the stores I've tried. It never gets old! 
Thank you Mt. Baker Vapor for being awesome! Keeping 15% of Bitcoin payments as Bitcoin and offering a special discount to Bitcoin payers- you're not only going to save money on payments, you're helping the Bitcoin economy and incentivizing Bitcoin usage. You're a great model for future businesses to look to when considering accepting Bitcoin.

It's huge. I like to think [No Man's Sky big]( but that could be an exaggeration. 
It allows Bigcommerce merchants to start accepting Bitcoin from customers in minutes, and the funds are automatically deposited into their bank account the next day, so normal operations aren't disturbed. Granted, we work with them to see the light, hodl, offer sales for the bitcoiners and promote their stuff. We also give them rapt attention throughout the getting-started phase. Also, you still have to buy from them. [Mount Baker Vapor]( did a fan-freakin-tastic job debuting their launch. Of course, they've got great staff that we'll be hard-pressed to meet elsewhere, but we're making an effort to make every one like this. Know a Bigcommerce merchant? Send them our way.
