Thank you, and yes I have been hearing it is not an investment but it is using a lot of that terminology as a market. I will be careful, I only put in what I could absolutely afford to lose and I'm hoping to leave it in long term and see this technology take off. That said, thank you very much for clarifying, I really appreciate it and you've given me more to research :).

What is the deal with all this hodl philosophy, won't it all become worthless if we aren't looking for more ways to spend it and use it as we do any other currency? If everyone held on and never spent any, wouldn't it cease to be of value, or only have a value tied to how much other currency is tied up in it? Truly asking if I'm understanding this correctly, otherwise let me know what I'm missing.

This makes more sense to me, thank you. I guess by that definition, it's what I'm doing as well.

I think it just means hold, from a popular misspell like how “own” became “pwn”. But then it was retconned to mean hold on for dear life.

Thank you for this clarification!

Likely doing it backwards but what I put in was a small, safe amount and not my savings or anything I plan to invest. I will be talking with a financial planner friend soon about investing for things like retirement. Thanks for the tip! I’ll poke around in that sub and get my learn on.

This isn’t how analogies work

Can someone explain simply to a newcomer to all forms of investing what a "correction" is?
