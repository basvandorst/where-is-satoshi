Yes, if you prefer anonymity, Bitcoin is definitely superior to PayPal.
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:44:27
I haven't requested any chargebacks either, but then two person's anecdotes don't make for a convincing argument. Clearly chargebacks do happen. And I would feel nervous about buying anything of significant using Bitcoin as it stands. But to be fair, a lot of that is down to unfamiliarity.
I can probably see Bitcoin gaining a lot of ground with the younger market, or at least the ones smart enough to get their heads around it. For the older folks who still seem to struggle to use credit cards for online orders, I can't see it happening.

Paypal are the bad guys for complying with international anti-money laundering legislation by looking to identify customers moving large amounts of money around?
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:12:04
I'm not sure that I follow. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:35:43
I can see the obvious appeal of accepting payments in a currency with no facility for chargebacks, but how do you get buyers to trust you? Business reputation, some sort of middleman?
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:40:32


Which is standard anti-money laundering procedure. If there's a lot of cash being moved, they're required by law to know who's moving it. Is Bitcoin not subject to this law?


Otherwise known as a Merchant Account Reserve, there to protect the payment processor against large numbers of chargebacks, and will be based on the risk level and past history of the business in question. Bitcoin does have something of an advantage here to the receiver, as chargebacks are not possible.

Yeah, don't worry about it :) 
I actually focused a fair bit on ecommerce when I was doing my Commerce degree back in the early 2000s, when it was still pretty hard to make money online, but we could see the potential was there. 
Never thought I'd see the likes of ebay/amazon/steam being so huge, though. And I definitely need to do more experimenting with Bitcoin. Maybe sink a tiny sum into it and see what kind of stuff I can buy.

I've done a fair bit of reading on both their policies and the stories I've read online about them. And everything I've seen ties in with what Rydan says. They will restrict an account for the reasons you describe, but they also close the account and release the funds after the 180 day hold period. Which obviously still sucks big time if you're a genuine business owner. But funds being held "in perpetuity" as you say, that shouldn't be possible.

I think you're missing the source of your problem. Transferring funds from your PayPal balance to your bank takes time because its an ACH transfer. If you sell your Bitcoins only Coinbase, it will also take 2-4 business days for the ACH transfer to hit your bank. Assuming you're in the US, in Europe it will be faster.
If you need a faster way to access your PayPal funds, I would recommend getting their debit card. Not sure if there's an equivalent way to turn your Bitcoins into local currency any faster.

Yeah I could see how you might think that I'm getting paid for this, given my commenting history. In truth I'd been lurking on Reddit for nearly a year. I'd seen a lot of irrational(and rational) anti-PayPal sentiment over that time, but at some point I just got tired of it and tried to inject some facts and common sense into the discussion, to varying degrees of success.
I certainly have no objection to people jumping into any discussion about PayPal to suggest Bitcoin as an alternative, if its something you're passionate about. But I felt the article title and some of the commenters were not being entirely fair. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 05:47:34
Seconding this. Finding this middleman who you trust to send $20 to, in the hopes that they forward it into a bank account(and have a way to do it near instantly) is pretty important. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:17:38
That's kind of the point though. If I see a merchant's website that takes PayPal or another online payment processor I now know two things. They've been vetted by that processor, and I'm protected by their buyer protection/chargeback options. If they take Bitcoin instead, from what I gather I have to go on whatever reputation they may have built up. I can see it working well for small transactions where delivery is near instant, like webcam show donations or subs, gaming microtransactions. But for physical goods where there's a time lag of a week or more between payment and receipt of the product, you'd need a good reputation indeed.
@_date: 2015-06-12 04:29:23
The person I was replying to cited the Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering procedures as a problem with PayPal, and most other payment processors, as its a legal requirement. Bitcoin has no such requirement, as far as I'm aware. Thus, its an advantage. Of course there are other benefits and downsides, also.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:56:58
I'd be surprised if there weren't thousands of complaints involving a company with a userbase over 100 million which has been operating for over a decade. 
And as a sidenote, three of those website have the most annoying popup ads ever. And one of them hosts user complaints, but doesn't let the organisation in question reply without charging them a fee...
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:28:53
Cool. Certainly for small amounts where you're not worried about needing to reverse a transaction, and can trust a middleman, Bitcoin seems pretty good. Closest thing to electronic cash there is. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 07:06:45
The actual cc payment is processed near instantly, at least as far as PayPal donations are concerned. The advantage Bitcoin would have here is that the recipient doesn't have to worry about the donation being chargebacked months later. Its been a recurring complaint with Twitch streamers that they get donations, empty their PayPal account, and then end up with a big negative balance when some chargebacks come through later.
If you get a Bitcoin donation, you know its there to stay(if I'm understanding the currency correctly)
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:53:55
Really, I was expecting some sort of effort at presenting facts for discussion, rather than throwing your arms up in the air and crying "shill". Disappointing.
"Risk &amp; Fraud
The reserve policy operates with a greater degree of unpredictability. According to this provision, Square may suspend or delay payment to a merchant in order to establish a reserve fund “to secure the performance of your payment obligations under this Agreement.” Square’s reasons for withholding these amounts (and the ways they calculate them) boil down to undisclosed algorithmic risk factors. There are numerous reports of these automated systems placing sudden, long-term holds on merchant funds without any clear way for a merchant to release the funds. Many merchants report holds being placed on perfectly legitimate swiped transactions. This policy is one of the most worrisome aspects of Square’s service at this time."
Most of the other parts of the article tie in exactly with similar complaints about PayPal. Its almost as if risk and risk-related holds are a necessary evil of acting in the market, and not just an artifact  of big mean PayPal.
@_date: 2015-08-12 05:03:43
I doubt you'll ever have a financial intermediary that offers both purchase protection AND never holds money to cover the cost of that purchase protection.
@_date: 2015-08-12 05:07:46
So if they take the buyers word every time, they're evil. If they take the sellers word every time, they're evil.
@_date: 2015-08-13 19:13:41
You know Carding is also a person's last name, yeah? :)
I certainly wouldn't have made the same logical leap or looked to ban account off of an email name. 
I obviously have to reason to doubt you, but I'm not being asked to forward on $400 based on your word, either.
They'd obviously need to have some investigative process in place so that people couldn't falsely claim unauthorized transactions and rake in huge money on PayPal payouts.
I know it'd suck to be in that situation personally, but in the vast majority of cases they do payout in those kinds of situations.
@_date: 2015-08-13 20:41:41
You made a claim that none of PayPal's competitors hold funds, I found one that did. Is Square also a bad company because of this? 
I'm not angry or looking to win an argument here, I'm trying to see if payment holds are the exception or the norm as a fraud protection measure in the credit processing field, and by your earlier comment I thought you'd have more info on it. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:17:31
The only one who got things mixed up were Cedar Point, by saying it'd go straight to your bank.
If you make a purchase using a debit or credit card attached to a PayPal account, its treated pretty much exactly as if Cedar Point had processed the card payment directly for you. And when they refund, they're simply refunding that original charge.
When you purchase using a bank account, PayPal sends the money to Cedar Point in advance, and initiates and ACH transfer from your bank that takes a couple days to complete. When Cedar Point refund you, they send the money back to your PayPal balance where they got it, but PayPal need your authorization to perform another separate ACH transfer to send it back to your bank.
I suppose its a reasonable assumption to make that it'd go back automatically, but at least you're aware for next time.
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:24:01
I'd be surprised if you could find a credit card provider that lets you accept credit card payments without also keeping a portion of your processed payments to cover the risk of chargebacks.
As for "PayPal does release the funds when pushed", I find that's usually the case of an error they weren't aware of, as in OP's case, or because the seller hadn't initially provided correct tracking information of items delivered.
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:22:37
Indeed. If it was an account set up as a charitable entity or a seller of small digital items(apps), then multiple payments from across the globe would be far less likely to get flagged.
@_date: 2015-08-14 00:22:12
Oh that's good, at least you weren't down the $400. 
And there's always alternatives to PayPal.
