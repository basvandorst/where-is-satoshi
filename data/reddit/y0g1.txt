It's by design, the devs want to see how much people are prepared to pay to make a transaction. They've achieved this by limiting blockspace and creating high competition in the fees market.

What cost, who do you think will be paying a cost?


What's not sustainable?

To defeat QC you just need a memory heavy function.

There is no block height limit, and no easter eggs hidden in the code.

Fees are a product of a free market for blockspace, and as such are a function of supply (blockspace) vs demand (num of transactions). To reduce the fees you'd need to increase supply and/or reduce demand.

If someone merges an easter egg into the main repository, you'll be sure to know about it. It's a public repository and widely monitored.

We're also getting back $400 million dollars in cash. So please everybody panic sell, while we're buying back the bitcoins we lost.

Thanks, you're a very friendly fella aren't ya :-)

Well then, may Satoshi bless you and protect your investments.

Do you think there's an argument that it depends on how you define bitcoin? For example, someone might define bitcoin as being the one that most closely resembles the whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:41:26


What does that mean?

Bought my first bitcoins at $4.

I believe he's a user on bitcointalk, I've sent him a PM &amp; I'll let you know if he responds.

I spoke to Aqueant and he says it's legit.
Others have sugested he faked it.

Brexit is a total shit show, I'm at a loss to understand why people voted for it in the first place. I'm all for switching fiat to crypto, but it would have to be one that's more reliable than btc.

The tax laws are different depending on what country you're in. Here in the UK, and I assume in the US too. Disposing of an asset is a taxable event. In your hypothetical scenario, the amount you sold them for, would be the value of the Lambo you bought.

And your point is?

Hello, I'm from 2011. In 2014 I was uncertain what was going to happen. I still don't know what's going to happen. So yes, it's very similar.

Nodes only need to check the latest block with the previous one, as the previous block was checked when it arrived.

Forget what you read because it's confusing you. Transactions usually have two outputs. One for the payment, and one for the change.

No, your BTC balance will be unaffected. Just make sure you know which one you're using.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:31:28
Are you being sarcastic?
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:19:42
You might be better off using an alternative crypto currency that has lower fees.
