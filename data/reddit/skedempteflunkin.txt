Have you managed to get anything out yet? They froze my account at first and claimed that it was because I was using Clef and new Ip Addresses as I was traveling. They I sent in tons of info on myself and they opened it. But it was not easy. Then I drained it.

You guys need to open the site. This is getting incredibly aggravating. Give us access to our money. I had cash, not lending and nothing to do with this hack whatsoever. Open the site and stop BS'ing us with delay after delay. You have no moral or legal ground to just hold on to our money and just PR your way out of it. When are you going to open the site!!!?

I would like to think that and I would also like to think that one day humans will not kill other humans...In Utopia...

Yes i saw this earlier, this is very interesting.

I found out that this is actually addressed in the whitepaper - "The URO Protocol is the baseline that underpins URO’s reference value – it is not (by itself) the ultimate end solution – The Foundation plans to develop an infrastructure with local wholesalers (already under negotiation) so that smaller quantities of urea can be purchased with URO."
Pretty amazing read actually

Thanks all, liking the responses so far and thanks for your input. I was hoping this is what people were thinking. 
I was just wondering as I played that little coin Arora when it first hit Crypty and not that many people were buying it. The supply was so small that I actually could manipulate the market with about 8 BTC and i ended up making like 22 BTC off it, but It was so easily manipulated before the big guns got there and then of course the airdrop crashed it. I can see how easy it is to manipulate this market if you have the coin/fiat.

Thank you...

Are you saying that the Fed owns those 173,000 coins? Crafty fed bastards.
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:31:55
yes i guess stability was the wrong choice of word...

The one thing that is largely forgotten and "Trusted" in this whole scenario is Who the fuck is Satoshi and where the hell is the 1 Million coins...
Why are BTC enthusiasts so trusting that this is not a ponzi scheme created by Russian and Chinese hackers and when BTC reaches "Market Share" (whatever that may be) those 1 million coins will suddenly reappear and make the fed or who ever owns them a whole shit load of money off our backs???
1 Million x $20,000 a coin = 20,000,000,000 ahem!

I have been doing quite a lot of research into this coin and I’m afraid your feelings are misplaced. I can see why you might think that there could have been problems in trusting this type of Crypto as there are certainly a lot of unsavory characters in Crypto World. I also understand you referencing that people may have bought in high as they did when BTC had spikes but that is pretty natural in the stages of crypto development into the mainstream as we all know.
I will try to explain to you why your understanding so far and feelings about URO are misplaced as i have spent the last 24 hours reading about this coin and before that I had checked into it as well for quite some time. I am now buying.
Here are detailed facts about the coin that back up it’s well intention: 
The initial mining and block reward structure was probably a crazy and perhaps badly conceived one unfortunately creating major miner dumps but as i understand this was as fair a way possible to distribute the coins. Read the whitepaper.
3.  Farmers CAN and WILL indeed be able to buy Urea with this coin. A brain wallet has been created that runs on BlockCypher called NURO. So far only BTC, LiteCoin and URO use Blockcypher. That is pretty telling. NURO was created specifically so that small farmers along side large importers can use URO to buy and sell Urea with. Right now only large orders are placeable with URO for logistics reasons and size of shipment. See Wiki. 
4. As time progresses there are plans in place to make smaller transactions of UREA possible. Things take time. 
5. The people who have brought this coin into public are renowned philanthropists so I very much doubt they are trying to steal anyones money.
6. NGO's are being approached to really bring this opportunity closer to the small farmer.
7. you can see an example of this with the new exchange that is being pointed to in this article. It is SPECIFICALLY for the underbanked small farmer in Cambodia and other exchanges in underbanked nations are underway. You would be hard pressed to find this with any other altcoin.
So in light of all this you might want to do a little more research. I am interested to hear your thoughts once you have done so.

clearly you have no response to what I said other than to point out one fault in what i wrote that pertains to Semantics.
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:23:31
Shuai, I found this which helps explain a lot of things. 
I think there has been a lot of people trying to bring URO down for whatever various reasons. Let me know what you think.
