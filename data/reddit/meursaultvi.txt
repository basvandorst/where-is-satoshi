You asked me about censorship. I definitely don't think censorship is built into the coin. However, social interaction is an important part of these coins. It's dead here. No freedom of speech.

Bitcoin is the only shitcoin I see on there.

Lack of upgradability. Skyhigh fees and censorship.

And your defense?

For starters is still your moderator. He's known for banning people for opposing views of how Bitcoin should be run. This the reason Bitcoin Cash exists. The whole subreddit was a refuge of banned subscribers. 
And at this point banning doesn't need to be done because you all will do it for them by down voting. You guys should be fighting for a more efficient system. 
Any developer with sense would not think that a system doesn't need to be upgraded. Instead you guys are adding support for handicaps via Lightning. There's nothing wrong with added supports but lack of updating the core system is a big no no.

There's at least one scam per cryptocurrency. It comes with the ecosystem. What matters is the scope of that scam. You should be worried about the future of the BTC chain. In what universe does a developer think that version 1 is best version and no improvements should be made to that version?
Instead BTC Core is just selling  overly complicated off chains that benefit corporations and banks. 
Yes, Roger may have jumped the gun on calling BCH the real Bitcoin but I don't think his goal was to purposely mislead people. 
We can counter blame chains all day but I think it's up to consensus how Bitcoin should be run. 
Edit: I would like to add that btc has its uses for hodlers, but some of us would like to spend our cash without high fees and even more complicated algorithms. I do not see why bch serve a good purpose without so much fighting between btc and bch?!
Edit 2: I love how I'm just getting downvoted with no opposing arguments....

Yes because BTC never had any scams/s

Awesome I'll check it out. I just hope this one sticks. I didn't like Bitpays card and Shift is disappearing before I get to use it.

MCO card? What's that?
