Well it's nice to hear they might be interested. It's nice there not just ignoring btc
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:50:56
Why do you think that? Just interested

Exactly. everyone is pointing out the huge drop. That's just it leveling out, becoming less volatile.

Is it easy to get an ebook published on amazon? I keep hearing of people doing it. Might write a short story to give it a go. Is it easier to do non fiction, or fiction?

very big leak

As soon as people stop taking it as an investment will be the day we are there. Bitcoin has come a long way and I don't think the price dropping is a bad thing. I'm waiting on btc to level out before spending a lot of money on it. Until then I will purchase the btc 5 min before I use it.

Alright, let me know how this goes for you. Goodluck by the way.

Have you had any successful ventures in which you got paid?
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:36:56
That makes since. I guess what i was saying is investing for purpose to make a profit.

Bitcoin starts to stabilize... "Oh no bitcoin is crashing to a stable market value in which it could be used for steady banking systems, what ever shall we do!"

Lol all someone needs is a vnc into your computer and your entire bank balance is gone. Its much harder to phish bitcoin. Even infecting computers won't work as wallets are encrypted.

Stabilizing... Not stabilized.

Def not bitcoins fault. TV needs to change the default settings to make it impossible to lock a user out of his/her machine

Nice find. Great to have the words straight from the horses mouth.

Read the document at the end of the article. The evidence of how they got the warrant is sealed. Parallel construction anyone?
