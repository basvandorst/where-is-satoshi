Ok question.  Theoretically if I throw my wallet.dat on a USB and keep my encryption written on paper only my coins are safe, off the Internet, and I can still send coins to my address, without touching the USB, and my coins that I'm sending will be safe.  My wallet.dat will just need to synchronize.     Is this correct?

Sure, because bitcoin is a great new currency, not an AI that is constantly bettering itself and surpassing human intelligence.  It's just a different concept. The code is constantly getting better cause its open source but that is cause people are updating this.  I wasn't being sarcastic or anything, I'm actually wondering how you are drawing this conclusion.  Is there something I'm missing. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:12:28
I would argue that they are one in the same, with the loss of anonymity you are setting yourself up for regulation (once the governments get their shit figured out). This could look very different depending on where you live but no matter what you will be effected.  
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:36:52
Nope. Why would u come to this conclusion.  
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:29:47
I like the visibility that this could bring but it also goes directly against the anonymity of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:11:39
Yeah dude!?   Why right?  I just don't get it.  They don't want to be seen as endorsing it maybe or something. Idk
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:13:50
totally, i see value in both anonymity, and a currency without borders or holds. not to mention instant money anywhere in the world
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:32:33
I'm not trying to negate your point here cause its valid. My thinking though is that I will see my return on investment in bitcoins there fore if I pick a winning company not only am I betting that bitcoin will do well but I am also increasing the amount of btc I hold.  Keeping in mind that it is a currency, although its looking like a well performing penny stock at the moment, it makes sense to put my btc to work.  This spurs growth in the economy by lending so its a win for me on two fronts as well as a win for the whole btc community.  
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:52:44
Why don't you just use bitcoin as your in game currency

I'd say that about sums it up.  I bet they're sorry they didn't wait a couple months.   
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:49:06
Yes to the first paragraph.  Lets be real.  Hoarders are inevitable, but what I'm worried about is the world seeing the jumps in price and tons of people buying in to the point where like you said most of the people are hoarders / speculators. Then when the price gets as high as its gonna go there could be mass panic and the majority of the markets dumps.  Btc might carry on stronger if this happened or it might fade to irrelevance with people putting their faith in LET'S or time coin.

I am a millionaire in the fiat system and it definently has its perks.  I am very luck to be in the situation I'm in. I have a "good life" now but that's not because of my money.  It's because I kicked my drug habit and started living life again.   I think you are making the assumption that money buys happiness which is not true.  I am in no way complaining about my situation. I'm just pointing out that the old colloquialism money can't buy happiness is true.  It's about how you choose to live your life.  
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:18:24
Well if the companies do well wont that increase my holdings in terms of bitcoins 
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:05:52
Because enough people chose the perks of using bitcoin over the perks of using the dollar. Simple as that. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:58:49
I would invest in a fund like this.  I believe I remember hearing of a fund that took investments in fiat and held btc. Simlar concept to buying bitcoin seems like but instead giving them to a banker. Lame. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 18:37:38
good to hear thanks you

It's better for the security of the network to download the whole blockchain.  The more of them there are the harder it is to corrupt/destroy them all. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:54:45
Great.  Upvote both then.  It's good for the btc community
@_date: 2013-03-29 21:26:11
Lol. This does bring up a good point.  The btc community is a little to hard to access for the general population.   Or rather a little to hard to use btc in all of its functionality ie having an offline wallet. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:58:48
yeah bro, my friends were like mining? is it a video game?
@_date: 2013-03-24 06:53:50
yes, i major benefit over the other exchanges,

@_date: 2013-03-26 18:44:55
well its pretty simple, when that happens the price goes way down and we go through what some might call a bubble, tons of noob speculators lose out, and btc has the publicity and user base to do even better then before once it recovers.
@_date: 2013-03-28 17:27:14
Oh he's already in.  Just too public to take a big stance on holding an Anon tax free currency. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:19:35
It means that one malicious entity finds a way to get 51 % of the hashing power and then stops processing the bitcoin payments of everyone
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:57:34
I'm a little confused about your question.  If u want to mine see the other comments (I have a Mac). As far as buying the best site for new folk in my opinion is coinbase however the infrastructure is still a little shakey. As far as investing in bitcoin business havelockinvestments.com

Why are people down voting this. Lets get btc recognized by porn
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:22:14
Those fears are totally founded.  The anonymity only works if you want it to aka not liking btc on your fbook or tying your name to a certain btc address.  
@_date: 2013-03-30 22:09:46
Totally.  I looked into mining when I first started with bitcoins.  At this point it's not economically viable to do unless you have specialized mining equipment and the wait list is pretty long.  I would suggest mining lite coins which u can still do with your normal comp and then trading them into btc
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:52:30
Dude just go to coinbase.com link your bank account, then u can buy bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-03-26 23:15:27
God dammit coinbase.  I just posted a thread about you myself.  I'm sick of the bullshit.  How many days do we give them honestly.  
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:00:15
Lol. I'm up voting this post, but honestly it doesn't stand a chance
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:45:13
true true, and that is ok with me. the point is the average in this world knows how to use fiat, although we on here can most likely all say that it is super easy to download a wallet and get starte, the average person cannot get past this first step......  think like old people who ask you why the internet isn't loading when there wifi is turned off. btc needs to be as easy to set up as gmail for widespread adoption 
@_date: 2013-03-23 23:52:54
Might i suggest limiting the number of accounts that can be created instead of coins that can be sold. it seems to me that to keep your current customers you want to provide them with a fair level of service of which you have been lacking of late. maybe if there was a que that delayed the creation of accounts until you can handel the current users. 
Update: i was waiting on two batches of coins, one of them was 3 days late and i have just recieved the coins, the other is still pending but was not supposed to get here till next wed. just wanted to let everyone know they are coming
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:06:19
I agree with him
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:32:47
You could use scannable QR codes.  This would probably be the best method for in person purchases. Physical coins do exist but are rare.  
Also the first btc ATM is now in existence and there are companies raising money right now to churn out more.  You could see if they are willing to make you a lucky candidate for the placement of a btc ATM. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:14:41
All the people holding coins, a 51% attack, and the community deciding to stop using them. 
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:57:44
just as with most currencies, the value is whatever the majority decides, this currency has some cool features though huh, call em perks. great post thanks
@_date: 2013-03-24 00:41:52
I hope so, I'm a believer that coinbase is legit and that they just need time, we cant expect perfection from a beta phase startup or we would be unrealistic. however the already unreasonable (in my opinion) wait to get coins has now been pushed even farther and i dont have coins. if the major issues are not fixed soon im going to stop using the service temporarily and watch to see if it becomes better run.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:18:20
Your totally right about other crypto currencies competing with btc and potential holding the price down because money that could be in the btc economy is instead in ltc or something else.  But keep in mind that btc is an open source software and if a cheaper way to secure the network comes along it will most likely just be woven into the btc framework.  Especially with the current level of investment, people just don't seem to give up to easily when it comes to their money. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 19:24:38
Honestly I'd rather have reddit use it if I had to choose. Once this spreads over all of reddit its only a matter of time till btc blows way up. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 20:54:52
I actually just saw an AMA or an "I Am A" maybe with him.   It was on bitcoin this morning.  
@_date: 2013-04-26 00:09:23
How would the gov sanctioning bitcoin turn it into a fiat currency?  It's still decentralized, anonymous, and finite. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:17:18
Because if they aren't used a currency then they are really just speculative and in the end this whole thing is going to look like a giant Ponzi scheme to the world.   Using them benefits everyone
