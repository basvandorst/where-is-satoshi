There we go. Infinitely divisible yet limited supply means that there will always be bitcoin for everyone. Everyone can benefit. Everyone can reap the abundance of a scarce good.  Never in the history of mankind have we transended beyond the limits of physical limitations and entered into the realm of true abundance. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 18:17:20
Amazing 
@_date: 2014-04-15 08:25:37
What does it matter? If you see this thread,  then you're obviously already interested in bitcoin. Not like its a headline in a major paper. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 08:35:30
Not exactly. The revenue from the mining can be used to offset the costs. Potentially leading to "free"  heating. 
Satoshi writes about this exact scenario in his white paper. 
@_date: 2014-04-06 21:43:58

@_date: 2014-04-29 08:36:15
Also he makes some good points. I think,  Bruce, the incentives for the creditors should be sweetened.

Nerds nerds everywhere 
@_date: 2014-04-27 21:30:00
We have a winner.  We have a limited supply of 21 million,  yet each unit is infinitely divisible. Does anyone know how this can be advantagous? 
@_date: 2014-04-07 18:08:49
I dont think they respect it enough to give it a serious try.

I stopped reading at the first sentence when the author calls MT Gox a bitcoin bank. As you should too. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:05:25
Yes,  and if it is ever to be paid,  it would be financial suicide through hyper inflation. Not a good corner to be in for the US.

We will know next month.

From using PayPal myself, I have discovered that I do not own or control my own money. That is why I feel paypal should burn a firey death.

You must not be fun at parties. 
@_date: 2014-05-06 17:59:59
Brilliant! You just shifted the paradigm from we only have 21 million bitcoins to wow 21 trillion bits. Psychologically this changes the perception for the noobs. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:58:47
Exactly my point.

Here's a safe and easy way for you to have a semi cold wallet. Send yourself an email with the seed words buried in text that only you can decipher. For example, your seed words can be every 3 words in a paragraph. That way, you will not have to risk losing your seed words and you have the advantage of being able to find your seed words anywhere in the world.

@_date: 2014-04-05 15:47:51
Because of how PayPal treats their customers. They are blinded by greed and lack the vision and foresight to see how better of a financial "service" bitcoin could be.

@_date: 2014-04-23 01:27:27
1,000,000 bits = 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:39:28
Not necessarily. A stock split multiplies amd inflates the supply.  Whereas bitcoin is divided into bits,  not multiplied into bits. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:05:56
In other news, bitcoin could care less.

Of course it doesnt to you.  You are an idiot. 
@_date: 2014-04-04 21:50:01
I view bitcoin more as a store of value with the perk of instant liquidity like currency.

@_date: 2014-04-12 05:21:02

Id be happy to have my coins back and equity in Gox. I would also begin trading again with leave of mind knowing that Gox was rebooted through the proper legal channels.

So if he evacuated his funds at a huge loss,  why is anarchystar still motivated to rehabilitate gox? This makes me question his motives. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 23:07:38
Solid information but the 16% equity is an insult to the creditors. Make it 25% and I guarantee you will get near unanimous consensus. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:08:48
You know what's more unprofessional? The damn webcam chat they all had a few days ago. Everyone looked like they weren't wearing pants. It was highly unprofessional and down right disrespectful to us. If those clowns showed up to a meeting like that, they would get laughed out of the board room.
