Why do people put up with that crap?  There are SO many options out there, if you bank does something you don't like, switch to a new one.

livecoinwatch.com - much better site imo

Keep shoveling that coal Chinese kids!  There's bitcoins in them there electrons!!!
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:26:05
live coin watch is my current fav.  I'm also joining the crowd in being done with CMC.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:27:04
Yeah but guessing the highs lows burns more people than it helps.  If you can't sit and watch pips all day, safer to hold and buy dips for steady wealth increase.

If the typical use case of bitcoin stays at the fees involved currently to move it around, then yes it will continue long term imo.  Read any other digital currency suggestions and right up there near  on 'how do I get this altcoin" is DON'T USE BTC ANYMORE.  Why?  Because of the cost to buy, then transfer, then exchange the BTC.  In the last couple of months the shift to ETH for this purpose has been huge.
And you know if it's happening on strategies on exchanging digital currency types it's also happening with other day to day use functions.
If they can get the ecosystem upgraded to new tech that allows drastically cheap transactions at any size, then it has a promising future as the largest and original digital currency.

Exactly, it's bitcoin and other gen 1 based currency's own fault they didn't evolve fast enough to keep ahead of faster/corporate business plan focused currency types.
As soon as it become even remotely possible to see bitcoin march up into the 10k plus range fixing speeds/fees should have become 24/7 holy shit fix it level of seriousness.
Instead the smug sat fat and idle on the riches build off the shoulders of the originators, and now suddenly find themselves behind the functionality curve, badly.  For years the term shitcoin was just thrown around at anything new, without thought to the emerging and serious flaws high utilization and high valuation would cause.

Stock traders call it 'trying to catch a falling knife'.  Basically you can't hope to confidently buy at the exact bottom.  But what you can do is be confident that it will eventually at a future point in time be higher than it is right now during a price collapse.
So you just buy while everything is heavily red, as you can.  If you wait until you are sure it's the bottom it's too late.  You can't know that until it's well on it's way to moving the other way again.

There are profits and then there are Mr T gold chain necklace profits.
This kind of crap is executives chasing bonuses and Mr T gold chains.  It has nothing to do with the company being profitable or healthy, just profitable enough to satiate current quarter lust for executive and large shareholder riches.
It's a systemic problem across modern day capitalism.  Profit is not enough, you  must have "make it rain" levels of profit at any cost the less fortunate humanity around them.

You have a point I'd say - but you should still keep another backup somewhere you can get to physically as well.

Aren't the Wall street big corporate money boys the exact type of crowd that bitcoin was supposed to brush aside?
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:15:46
This is a very valid statement.  As long as digital currency can be "lost" with the smallest of screw ups, it will be a big problem for  mass adoption.  There are still enough "Oh shit my bitcoin..." posts on this sub by experienced users to admit it's a problem imo.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:25:54
I hope op is planning on 1/3 of that saved out for taxes if he cashes it to fiat currency.  There is little chance that much money is going to go unnoticed by the IRS.

This is a horrible stat a actually.  What its really saying is that if you took every bank in the world and added 25% more banks - that energy use would be relatively tiny bitcoin.
That such a small segment of the financial system could use that much energy is not a good thing.  Mining Efficiency must be improved.

From what I remember you activate it in the menu, under security settings, and the the VPN icon shows up in your URL bar.  You can toggle it at that point.
If you are someplace like work where you are sitting being an inspection firewall and/or NAT it probably won’t work from there and could be against company policy anyhow.
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:00:37
Opera is great browser that doesn’t get enough recognition.  The built in VPN button by itself is worth the install and use.

I use this site, its solid.  2 factor auth.  Linked to my checking account.
Use it for monthly charges to various sites without having to give my actual credit card numbers.  Set up limits on the privacy cards so they are only allowed so much money per month of about the amount the service charges. (11 dollar monthly limit on my 10 dollar a month service for example).
Also use it for one off online purchases with the “one use” card feature.  Card nukes itself after single charge goes through.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:33:37
Agreed.  I'd be extremely skeptical to put money outside of the top 3-5 market cap cryto currencies.  The top handful have real world use to some degree.  The rest are pure speculation and used borderline nowhere outside of trading.

Of course that because they have something like 80% of the wealth (or more?).

Then, if one desires that level of safety - you open up an additional account at an additional bank.

Well that bring up a good point.  SOMEDAY it WILL be cracked - if nothing else when quantum computing gets another 10-30 years of advancement.  Is the chain able to be upgraded to newer technologies in encryption if the devs decide it's needed?
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:18:49
Such BS.  This is bank FUD.  I'm all about sticking it to the man, but the man is FDIC insuranced.  So in this case as close as one can get in this financial world to 100% safety of one's wealth.

That's why when the price drops you have to hit the ground running.

Good points.  Anyone that does that will still die anyway.  It's Worth considering and including in the plans.

That's a fair sentiment - and yet we are humans.  We are going to F stuff up with mental lapses on occasion at best.
It's certainly a weakness in the global adoption in digital currency.  No one's grandma and teenage kids can be trusted to use it without  serious risk of loss of access to wallets happening all over the place.

Often I agree with this statement, but in this case a good thumping needs to happen.  If nations use chemical weapons and nothing happens?  Its only a matter of time until a butt hurt dictator pulls off big, horrible attack takes place that kills and maims hundreds of thousands - millions.
This way they know - if I use them, i will suffer 100% chance.
Its the same logic that kept humanity from death to a large nuclear war.

I'm sure you would have checked this already, but maybe worth mentioning: Any chance your VM has a snapshot that could be rolled back to?

When I read stuff like this I always have visions of "Wall-E" and the Earth shrouded with a thick layer of discarded satellite space junk in the not so distant future.

For every 'smart' guy who bought Apple on the cheap and got rich there are 10 who bought Enron cheap and got rich for a bit and then lost it all.  
Don't confirmation bias yourself into stupid financial choices.  You win some, you lose some, and it's more luck/lightning in a bottle based than most of us would like to admit.
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:37:37
It tells you it is being used for stuff.  Thats worth quantifying.
