Ahh I briefly googled the definition before asking and didn't get the implications to bitcoin, I know about what you're saying, just not this term itself.
Learned a new word today, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:53:07
Nah its fine i'm a super minority on this sub. I'm still doing research every day, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:33:15
Thanks for the advice! I already know about this but unfortunately GDAX doesn't support my country or my country's currency (somehow the Coinbase service does), my current situation also means I cannot get myself verified on GDAX (they require an additional level of verification over coinbase) I was so bummed out when I found out.

Ok, so a country or whoever buys a huge amount, or lets assume already has it, and now owns the lions share of BTC.
Then what? if they tried to do anything funny with it the value would just plummet and they would shoot themselves in the foot because they own most of it in the first place. People could also just hardfork and say "fuck you"
Edit: Its possible to just block the address of the whale in the new fork and have everyone move to it + continue as normal assuming everyone agrees and it doesn't create some sort of ETH Classic situation, which I assume they should since it's EVERYONE vs 1.

Does me and my left hand count?

I'm actually interested in knowing what Segwit, or Segwit2X is, and whether I have to do anything special once it is integrated.

The ledger can easily verify that the bitcoin is still in those addresses that they supposedly own, the problem is this "gang" you're talking about cannot prove that the addresses belong to them, because presumably they had a wallet on that flash drive containing their private keys, and all of them were lost. 
Also, I would assume sitcom episodes are filmed months in advance.

If you lose your physical wallet, that money is also as good as lost forever. You can choose to trust your bank with your money, Bitcoin doesn't have that right now, but if there is a need for it due to mass adoption and convenience, someone would surely create a system like that and effectively become a bank for Bitcoin.
In fact, most people who don't care as much just leave their coins on exchanges like Coinbase, they can effectively function as banks, of course much less secure, but it shows that it is possible.

It is only if you haven't kept a copy of your keys or seeds. Treat it like your password. Say you lost all your electronics now, do you remember your (for example) Google account email and password? If so you can buy a phone or something and sign in to your google account as usual.
it's a shitty analogy, but with bitcoin you have a public key (email), and private key (password). A wallet usually manages those for you. And there's no secret question or 2nd email to use to verify yourself unless you set up your own system to do that.
So presumably these people had a wallet on this flash drive, but they lose it, and don't have a copy of their keys anywhere else, so yes, lost forever.


I realize bitcoin might be really similar to stocks, but the key here is that it's supposed to be a currency, and there's a limited amount that can ever exist. Widespread knowledge and adoption of it might not have the same effects. Nobody can tell you if this will make it go up or down, but just that it's not the same thing.

~~True, it's past midnight here and my brain is fuzzy, no idea wtf i was thinking when I said that.~~
Edit: Yea just implement a simple block to all of the whale's addresses in the code, I should really stop answering questions when i'm tired. Thanks @_date: 2017-12-01 19:43:02
Ok this is a bit out of my depth, I understand the first part, but what does this mean?


@_date: 2017-12-01 20:21:15
Well if you want decentralization, then you gotta take the responsibility that comes with it, security is on you. So far people seem to be fine with that.
There will be options to make it more and more convenient, like the hardware wallets that people have these days.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:51:53
nope, doesn't have my currency, dealing with exchange rates on top of all the bullshit exchanges thorw at u is always not worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:08:10


Holy shit just what I need, the fees are crazy right now that it defeats the point of using btc for micropayments. Also makes frequent transfers out of exchanges fucking painful.
Thanks for the info, I guess its just a matter of having a segwit wallet, and paying attention to which exchanges still use legacy and use the old wallet for those? Is there backwards compatibility or anything?
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:52:45
I hope so to, my post was targeted at their service being unavailable during that period and why it wasn't solely them to blame.
I fully agree with many of the other issues like huge wait times and ridiculous verification requirements, high fees, almost non-existent support etc.
It's just for me, I don't really have a choice, coinbase is the least shitty.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:26:11
"Potential" is basically any crypto that Coinbase adds LUL
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:29:46
I'm not in the US, which I assume you're talking about when you say the IRS, i'm not even in Europe.
Hence me saying "given my current situation" specifically, I have checked my current country of residence's tax laws, no capital gains tax on cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:53:51
Very clickbaity/misleading title from that website. It implies pessimism due to the context that the word "bubble" is almost always used when paired with "bitcoin" but the content is actually not like that at all.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:53:05
I really doubt anything would happen, it would basically be your parent's account, all verification would be done by them.
All you're doing is using their account.
Of course, now we get to the hard part of them trusting you to know wtf you're doing, and I assume the part where you trust them not to screw you over if you make it big somehow should be resolved since they are your parents.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:09:43
Well alright I was making an assumption there, shit certainly isn't easy in South East Asia that's for sure. I see a lot of "Based in the US", "Backed by US investors", and special options like "Are you 
a US Resident" when verifying accounts so that got me thinking. Also many exchanges only bother about the USD.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:41:55
I've researched several options and given my current situation, somehow coinbase is the best option I have at least for now (I'm eyeing other exchanges). So there might be some bias from me here. Also, i'm not in the US or Europe, so a lot of the conventional wisdom in this sub doesn't apply to me.
All the other huge exchanges went down as well during that period, people who blame coinbase (I saw a lot on their sub) just dont understand how servers work.
"But they have a lot of money just throw more money at it to solve the problem". Yea throw more money in so that they can handle that one peak with 8x regular user volume which is completely unpredictable and immediately comes and goes so auto-scaling is not effective, and then what for the rest of the year? Just hemorrhage money out their asses?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:34
They are apparently experiencing an all time peak, 8x the last one: 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:05:36
what I mean is that im not blaming u OP. That website phrased their article title in a very pessimistic way, saying its the "biggest bubble of our lifetime" implies that it will pop and amount to nothing in the end, while the contents of the article actually say otherwise.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:44:37
No kidding, I just got in this week and the hurdles are fucking immense, especially if you live outside the US.
Gets even worse if you're working or studying abroad, the verification process that every goddamn exchange wants you to go through becomes a huge mess.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:49:35
Unfortunately there is a catch if your currency/country isn't supported, which I assume is a minority of people on this sub. Pay close attention to the trading pairs shown here before getting overly excited: 
It also requires additional verification, which might prove to be a problem given situations where you're working/studying abroad or smth, and you want to trade in local currency but have no local driving license/passport.
I'm not able to make use of this, not yet at least.
