Freezing is neither needed nor legitimated (beyond preventive-provisional temporal measures for investigation). See also: Third of bona fides possession.

Thanks for your response. 
1. I meant there are other business models where "to pay to the floor" is not the main cost (even not a cost).
2. I fear it's not the same. ATM commissions can be charged on every transaction or on every bitcent transacted (volume).
3. Happy you agree. I agree with you that it doesn't change the fact that for an ATM to be profitable it needs to handle a great amount of transactions if you rely on charging small fees. But I am suggesting that there are variables which, took into account, can get that break-even transaction volume. And it's not theory, I repeat: there are huge global chain businesses currently working in Spain which could be easily substituted by bitcoin nowadays. And with less costs.
4. Thanks God you are not judging the profitability of a business by its probable first month demand. Thaaaaaanks God.
5. I already told you. Investors are not coming, not by reason of lack of profitability, but by reason of legal threats. I will repeat it to you again, a last time: "A more likely explanation for this BCN ATM retirement is fear of government sanctions. Audits and defense from expert legal counsels are probably the key for the next step."
6. Ok. So you have no sources, but you feel comfortable doing sentences like those before and sure about what are you saying, and require others for them. Then now I don't really know what I am doing here discussing this with you. Have a nice day Mahn and take care, see you next in bitcoin/mtgox reddit post.

Probably they want to use coinjoin for mixing. Its limit is 50btc per address.
Is there no a way to catch them before mixing? IP/ISP/any other data? Nothing? Come'on we're a huge high-tech wise community!

Maybe using a shift currency between pesos and btc.

The issue is not to criminalize the last holder, but to follow back the money to get the robber's identity. Exactly the same method than in bill of exchanges or marked notes.

1. Search for: sinergia, business models, hidden revenues.
2. Sure.
3&amp;4. Those huge business exists because they have demand. Mahn, I can tell you louder, but not clearer. Understand the variables, and you will see the demand.
5. IMO the problem actually lies over the ATM format. It's like sell printed books in the s.XIX using a business model designed for handwritten books industry. 
6. Yes, I have, I told you. But I don't have the obligation of unveil my source and compromise nobody's business. Maybe you could search for "regulación" "España" and "bitcoin" in Google and you'll come to the same conclusion. Projects around Spain are bubbling, but legal threat is too high so entrepeneurs do not feel secure. I'm going to tell you a definitely last time: "A more likely explanation for this BCN ATM retirement is fear of government sanctions. Audits and defense from expert legal counsels are probably the key for the next step."
7. Oh Mahn, please... I expected more !
Anyway, thanks again for your response. Best regards.

They were no creditors, but depositants / holdees. They should supposedly be protected and secured. They actually are the only who should not to be affected as far they are not merchants, businesses or finantial entities; but consumers of a virtual good.

Errr... Why? Who are going to be supposely 'killed'? And whom represents the guy at the end?

I fear you are wrong. Yes, it does.
@_date: 2014-06-10 16:35:00
Are you joking? I already listed them, but sadly I see you are lazy enough not to use Google. This is the last time I do your task.
1. You can find many enquiries about ATM on FB Bitcoin España  By the way, today we have an example of an user using an ATM in Madrid  
2. Some Cafe Bitcoin and Madrid Meetups where ATM were asked for specifically.  
3. Projects of ATM in Spain:    
4. A more likely explanation for this BCN ATM retirement is fear of government sanctions. Audits and defense from expert legal counsels are probably the key for the next step. ---&gt; Even when I am quite sure I am right, I can not make an undoubt statement like yours. I am quite more prudent, don't you?
OK. And now it's my turn: 
"The demand of Bitcoin in Spain is nowhere near enough to make ATMs at malls a viable business." Citation needed.
"They removed it because a bitcoin vending machine can't even pay for its own floor space. " Source required.
Thank you.

I fear my sources are quite better (actually they exist and are direct, not like yours), but humility can be found in my words with expressions like 'more likely'. Otherwise than in yours. Anyway, you are well free to maintain and share your opinions, even though you are expressing them as real statements when they are not. Have a good day Mahn.

This post is an example. There are more like this one in closed  Bitcoin España FBgroup. Some people have also showed out interest on Cafe Bitcoin and Bitcoin Madrid meetups. There are currently running 4 proyects of ATM installations in Spain, including one of those their one ATM machine. A more likely explanation for this BCN ATM retirement is fear of government sanctions. Audits and defense from expert legal counsels are probably the key for the next step.
And now, it's my turn CryptoThief, Mahn. Source of your info?

As far as MTGox is a member of the BF, they may, at least, audit Gox to check that everything is being fixed  correctly, and open AMA about the MtGox situation.
If after audition it reveals a bad situation, take part and helping to fix it. Otherwise they should be openly supporting MTGox.

This is what our current whole finantial system looks like: odd, unefficient and embarassing.
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:54:03
Hi Mahn. Mistakes on your assumptions: 
1. "To pay the floor" is quite a doubtable cost as far as it depends on the business model, isn't?
2. ATM needs a transaction volume, no number of transactions. 
3. The number of transactions depends on variables such as where it is radicated, its usability, its utility and so forth. There are excellent hubs where a machine like this one could get a large transaction volume. Actually, substituting huge global business chains of currency exchanges and money senders.
4. Four business in Spain (+hundreds of local sellers through the whole territory) are currently prooving you that there is market to make local exchange business like this viable and profitable.
5. Do not judge the profitability of a business by its probable first month demand. I repeat: A more likely explanation for this BCN ATM retirement is fear of government sanctions. Audits and defense from expert legal counsels are probably the key for the next step.
6. Still waiting for the sources of your sentences.
Best regards.

Ask your parents / tutors, they may help you. Look for localbitcoiners around you, or offer a service on subreddit /beg or /jobs4bitcoins, or sell something through a bitcoinmarket. If you can't do anything of those options (job or pay), I don't know how you expect to gain 'money'. Perhaps you can ask for an under-18 saving account on your bank for making a little deposit, or convince someone to send you money to a e-cash service (paypal, webmoney, egopay, okpay, payeer, and so forth). As a very remote possibility, you could mine some new coin foreseeing its hype and, after that, exchange your coin balance for bitcoins.

Scenario and facts drive me to believe so strongly that he is lying, that I am almost totally sure that there is no a real piece of truth on his words.
@_date: 2014-05-12 11:26:16
Bitcoin is a lot of things. A token, a protocol, a consensuated community, a distributed finantial system for a information economy...

There are pump and dump groups manipulating the price on MtGox. I'm totally sure of this. Search them on DuckDuckGo, they have even Twitter

And what if we incrementally increased the chargerback fee. For example, having already burnt the whole transacted amount (for example 10BTC -bought object price-) after a successive and contradictory series of chargerbacks, the result is currently leading to a loss of 15BTC for the buyer (+object) and 5BTC (-object) to the seller. The miner is the only rewarded for the stupid chargerback war, so buyer and seller are not incentivized to do so. Likewise, a collusion between buyer and miner exposes the buyer to a high risk of loss.  
It continues not being perfect. If the buyer achieves to be the miner of all the chargerbacks transactions his power of abusing seller is infinite. However it doesn't look easy, does it?
