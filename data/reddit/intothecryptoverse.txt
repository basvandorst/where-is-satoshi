Lol yeah I know what you meant. Anyways I do understand your sentiment. Just trying to use some analysis to provide some sense to a non-sensical market. Anyways no hard feelings here if you don’t like the content.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:50:05
Nice! You have an ELO? maybe we could play sometime
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:56:41
I haven’t played as much in the last year, but on lichess I think I’m around 1900 or so. I would definitely be up for a game sometime
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:20:08
Yes you have, I am an academic. I have a PhD in engineering. And I can still understand your sentiment, my content isn’t for everyone by any means.

When did I ever say a 3 month cycle? I haven’t even making videos that long, so how did I predict 3 months a year ago? And the video doesn’t claim it’s a 4 year cycle anyways. Clearly you didn’t actually watch anything and you are projecting what others have said onto me. Both of which are completely ridiculous
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:51:01
Ok fair enough. If you do ever decide to waste your time watching my videos, I try to show some unique stuff. This video isn’t really that unique but a lot of them are. Anyways can’t blame you, the market for YouTube crypto people is fairly saturated
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:47:42
Lol, you play chess?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:08:59
Hate when this happens
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:15:13
Everyone has been saying this since $5000
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:42:30
I do not see a dump. Look it's cool that you called a correction, I'm just saying plenty of people call them all the time and are wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:18:21
What are you talking about? Tons of people all over TradingView and Youtube have been calling for a hard correction for months.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:08:44
Many of us suffer from that occasionally
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:16:10
DCA is best bet
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:08:27
This is a historical rally for sure. I keep thinking we must pullback at some point. ...right?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:14:48
We should be growing for another couple years
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:33:52
People have been screaming pullback constantly for months. Of course if people keep saying it, some can always claim they called it correctly. Clearly there will be many pullbacks on a route to a new ATH
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:10:31
I love all the classic TA guys growing old waiting for the crash to $2500
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:12:03
I was about to say welcome to the week
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:19:17
You can still take the ratio between percent gained and time and see a similar pattern. You must be a pleasant person in real life
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:09:43
Log charts are the only real option at this point. Best way to show percentage gains
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:28:50
My point is people like to pick apart anything anyone ever does. I’ve also showed percent gained vs time videos, ROI on a window approach, and countless other videos too. You are just looking at one picture and criticizing me for it.
I get the complaints about the aspect ratio. There would still be a pattern even if I change the aspect ratio. Yes, maybe not 0.67,0.67,0.67 etc but 0.8,0.7,0.6. 
I can promise you I did not manipulate the graph in any way. This is the output from matlab with these limits. This is the aspect ratio by default in matlab.
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:51:02
I suggest you look up linear relationships and understand how they don’t depend on aspect ratio. If I had used a different aspect ratio And the relationship between them was 0.5, You would say the same thing.
I did not backpeddle. The linear relationship exists. It doesn’t matter how much I squeeze or expand the scale. There is still the same relative difference between curves. It might be 0.5, 0.2, 0.9, doesn’t matter.
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:59:14
You know what, you are right. I made a mistake. It was a stupid oversight. I hate swallowing my pride and admitting it but it’s true. I let my knowledge of other graphs cloud my judgement and I’m now dealing with the consequences. It was a mistake.
@_date: 2019-12-18 05:30:25
ya, but the numbers are smaller since the scale is not linear.
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:46:47
glad you felt the need to say that
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:19:52
I got similar type projections with different aspect ratios, just the angle or ratio changes. What’s funny is your inability to understand that it’s about percent change, and the aspect ratio was shown for visualization. You keep doing you though
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:01:37
Do you understand that linear relationships exist, independent of aspect ratio. The exact number will change but the correlation still exists. But you can continue to have your fun thinking the only thing important is the aspect ratio
@_date: 2019-12-18 04:25:47
No the percentage difference in price is stabilizing. What made you think it is getting wider?
The absolute value will get wider since if BTC reaches $100,000 and drops to $20,000, that is an 80% loss, which is still less than many losses in the past by percent, but larger in absolute price difference.
@_date: 2019-12-18 06:43:53
Glad you like it!
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:18:21
I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again. I even said it in the video. Yes, it depends on the aspect ratio. It doesn’t mean that I wouldn’t find a similar pattern.
@_date: 2019-12-18 21:58:19
You know what, you are right. I made a mistake. It was a stupid oversight. I hate swallowing my pride and admitting it but it’s true. I let my knowledge of other graphs cloud my judgement and I’m now dealing with the consequences. It was a mistake.
@_date: 2019-12-18 19:08:16
I think you aren’t catching the idea of using this to spot trends. I have like 10 different charts in the video. All you care about is one chart because of the aspect ratio. There is still a trend which I have shown with other graphs that do not rely at all on aspect ratios. I would please ask you to look at the other graphs too. If you just look at one graph I can understand your skepticism. But please take the time to analyze the other graphs as well
@_date: 2019-12-31 14:50:19
Well shit
@_date: 2019-12-18 02:30:29
This shows 4 different charts:
1) Logarithmic regression bands with past data and projections
2) Logarithmic regression fit using only "non-bubble" data
3) ROI from every market cycle bottom (EDIT: Ignore the angles I drew, completely dependent on the aspect ratio). Feel free to make a clever jab about it in the comments. I’m owning it now, so I’ll just take it in stride.
4) Bitcoin price with risk chart

I said it was not meant to be predictive but just a fun analysis over and over and over. I’m a developer too, I have a PhD in engineering. I just made a simple analysis, not meant to be your holy grail of TA. Take it for what it is. I can draw all the graphs I want.
Lol at “I wrote an equation.”
It was a simple ratio, stop making it into something it’s not. It’s not like I setup schrodingers equation and am solving for various functions. 
I made a graph in matlab and showed a linear correlation. Change the aspect ratio to whatever you want and there will still be a correlation. It won’t be 0.67. But there will be a correlation. 
I imagine you’ll just double down, brag again about “how you are a developer” just to try and get more jabs in. Believe it or not, you aren’t the only one to have ever gone to school
@_date: 2019-12-15 06:14:17
Of course I did. Most of what I do is just show historical data and tell people it doesn't represent the future, but just to use it as a tool in doing their own research. I just thought it was funny you decided to take a jab at it for something I never even claimed.
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:20:11
Congrats, you have successfully demonstrated how people like you have nothing better to do that criticize others to make yourself feel better.
@_date: 2019-12-18 04:42:32
It's a log scale :)
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:58:25
For bitcoin logarithmic regression, market cycle and other analysis
@_date: 2019-12-18 17:57:41
Glad to see some people get that while aspect ratios may change the  exact relationship, a relationship still exists. And I’m drawing a random future line with the same aspect ratio. I thought about discussing the aspect ratio but assumed people would understand that linear correlations are independent of the aspect ratio. Maybe the trend changes to some other number, but the trend is still there.
It’s comical though watching people in this thread have a field day with the aspect ratio. For those who think I manipulated the graph, I invite you to put these limits into matlab and see that this is the default aspect ratio. I did not manipulate it in any way. Is 0.67 a happy coincidence using this aspect ratio? Sure. But there is still a correlation and a trend
