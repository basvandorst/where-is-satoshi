hence the quotes? i know it's not less secure in specific cryptographic sense, it's less secure in general "my transaction is not recorded in the blockchain" sense. there are multiple failure modes associated. feel free to pick a different word that describes this tradeoff.


i don't understand what you're getting at but now that i think about it, miners can choose to ignore computationally expensive transactions unless they come with higher fee, so my point is moot.

the difference now is that LN doesn't need a protocol change.
since Segwit fork all that is needed to provide LN and payment channels to end users is a piece of software that anybody can opt in to use. this is orders of magnitude easier than getting consensus around a hard-fork or soft-fork.

On the other hand there is no free cheese, block space is finite and people choosing to use it pay transaction fees. They pay for all the guarantees of blockchain, as opposed to layer two, where txs will supposedly be cheaper but less “secure”. If there is a way to trade computational requirement for space requirement - it would be natural way to introduce fees for confidentiality.

That is simplistic and a great way to avoid answering any valid questions. I actually observe such approach to arguing in pretty much everybody who didn’t give much thought to what they are arguing for or against.
Elaborate please why should the political system evolve in the specific direction that you really wish it evolved towards?
@_date: 2015-12-02 11:01:48
this boils down to whether you are anarchist or not.
if yes - doesn't make sense to continue discussion.
if not and if you consider that taxation by government is fair concept - then government is already supposed to know how much money everybody has (i don't see how that makes anybody a slave but w/e). 
however in case of corruption there is a gap between declared income and actual income - this is a problem government is trying to fix.
this is all quite simple really, you just have to put down your tinfoil hat for a second. i mean, come on - bitcoin is **fucking public ledger**! everybody in bitcoin system potentially knows how much everybody else has.

mimblewimble stuff sounds amazing. can anybody explain how schnorr/bls relate to it? as i understand schnorr and bls also allow aggregation, in some scenarios to the point where whole blockchain with all transactions can be "contained" in a single signature.

if outputs of mixers are marked in such a way that nobody can use them for legal shit - you haven't really solved anything. and bitcoin makes it trivial to blacklist outputs. i can see it as part of government regulatory mechanism in future - sort of anti-laundering scheme. it is a digression though..
i wonder how do you think government ought to spend your money - make a referendum for each transaction? what if to successfully implement a program government needs to make 3 transactions and "people" are manipulated by opposition to reject the last one?
ultimately your vote is a consent to spend your money. the more decentralized you get - the more value you get out of your vote but cost of making global decisions grows. it's a tradeoff.
@_date: 2015-12-25 16:19:55
PrivatBank is largest bank in Ukraine by far. It's also been regarded as most innovative in terms of digital services so i'm not surprised they're biting into Bitcoin. The real question is how will NBU react - they haven't made bitcoin legal means of payment yet and last i heard weren't really open to the tech.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:52:51
But that is only true when blocks aren’t full? If mempool is large, miners are in a race to fill blocks with available txs and start spinning the nonce. Filling the block is CPU-bound task, so spending 40 times the cycles on CT only makes sense if it has [40 / space factor] times the fees? Am I missing something?

corruption is not a binary measure, when you say you can prove my statement false you imply that government can only either be corrupt or not corrupt - this is false. every government is corrupt to some degree and this degree changes in time.
one possible scenario - greek governments were mostly corrupt which annoys people and creditors, current government doesn't want to lose it's shit and either pretends or really is imposing some anti-corruption measures. making people declare their assets is one of such measures.

this is my reasoning:
- bitcoin is decentralized network of nodes that verify transaction  and block traffic on the network
- bitcoin miners rely on that network to propagate blockchain state
- bitcoin users rely on that chain to confirm their payments
so by running a node i'm by default helping miners and users. apart from that i'm contributing to the enforcement of consensus on bitcoin protocol - that is core requirement for bitcoin to be successful and resilient against attacks.

vitalik's response to that is "yeah, programs have bugs, we will try very hard to fix them", and that is imo non-answer. language must be out of the box formally verifiable (including formar verification of equivalence of source code and bytecode) with relevant tooling or it must be dumb like bitcoin's. anything else is incompetency that will cost people money.

Ultimately the answer is to simply follow the money. Think of it as if not only the transaction history being shared but also market cap. It was 16m coins worth 2700 each, it is now 32m coins worth some split of those 2700 each plus the market movement delta. The amount of USD/CNY/etc behind bitcoins hasn't changed and shifts in btc/bcc will correspond to market faith in either of them.

Too much conflation going on here. All you can do on an exchange is withdraw into a BTC address. If these exchanges you mentioned have some partnership that allows direct transfers between accounts - that has nothing to do with bitcoin or at least its impossible to tell where the problem is. If you’re trying to withdraw Into an address provided to you by destination exchange - then your problem is with source exchange not presenting you with transaction fee options.
The way you described your problem means it’s impossible to tell what and where is going wrong. Network doesn’t look particularly overloaded right now, transactions at 10sat/byte are regularly cleared according to

when was last time you checked at what part of donetsk and luhansk oblast is actually being held by rebels? hint: it's even half. and compared to Ukraine in total it's really small.
40% is exaggeration. yes, those were some largest industrial regions Ukraine has but it wouldn't be overstatement to say it wasn't adding much to economic growth - those regions were net-negative in terms of country's budget and were donated heavily. those numbers are easy to look up on the internet. and whatever those industrial monsters were producing was basically being pocketed by local oligarchs.

@_date: 2015-07-27 16:03:09
then you can confirm that what i said is true :)
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:15:35
you rpesented the "su-25 case" as an example of how western media manipulates and doesn't present the full picture. that means you consider this evidence to be valid and worthy of investigating. that means russia has already tricked you into false version at least once. and during last year there were multiple versions and explanations - all of which served single purpose - seed as much confusion and lie into your mind as possible and stop you from believing the very simple and straightforward version that ukrainian government had been defending since tragedy occured: separatists got a hold of buk system and shot down the plane. 
this is the most simple explanation. and it has evidence too. you will ignore this evidence because russia gave you 20 other conflicting explanations with conflicting evidence.
how about some intellectual honesty and integrity?
and let's go over your claims again:


su-25 does not operate at such altitudes - this has been confirmed by designed of the plane himself. air-to-air missiles do not have enough power to cause the damage mh17 had suffered - this is pretty much common knowledge by now, you can google that or i can google it for you if you like.


there are UAAF flights happening all the time in different regions of ukraine. unless you show me the concrete evidence that proves "shadowing" (whatever that means) this argument means nothing


it was ordered to fly the very standard route that many other planes have used every day up until the tragedy. this is open data and you can look it up.


it was following the very standard echelon that was used by various flight up until the day of tragedy. this is open information and you can look it up.
but why do you not mention anything about spanish dispatcher working at ukrainian airport that russian media was all over about and it turned out to be fake? why do you not mention anything about "pictures from spy satellite" released at russian officias ministry of defense briefing about the tragedy? those turned out to be fake too. why are those outright lies completely ok to you?
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:41:32
Except you couldnt because russian propaganda is basically obvious and massive while whatever you will present for "western propaganda" will be speculation or inaccuracy at best.
So basically you have russia supplying rebels with heavy artillery and tanks and mass recruiting troops into rebel army. On the other hand you have "deeply concerned" eu and laughable attempts at supplying a sovereign country with "lethal weapons" that nobody had really seen so far.
That is the difference between our worldviews and they are not even remotely "equally defendable".
@_date: 2015-07-28 14:22:59
is that best you got? where is the crazyness? do you seriously think it compares to "ukrainian army crucified a baby in front of a village"?
lets do this one by one


this is simple fact. there was a lot of stuff happening last year but just look at this without attaching your emotions:
1) are there russian troops among rebels and are rebels using russian heavy artillery? yes. proven facts. that constitutes invasion part.
2) have russia declared crimea it's territory without any agreement from ukrainian side? yes. proven fact. that constitutes annexation part.
yes, you can run circles around those facts rationalizing russia's actions, etc. but those 2 things happened and if they are being presented in this blunt way by western media - it's speculation at best, not propaganda.




you have to be seriously retarded to believe Su-25 using air-air missiles did this. even russia's official position have shifted from this ridiculous bullshit to a more vague position of "yeah, this was Buk but it was in a territory controlled by ukrainian forces".
seriously, just google the fucking operational specs of Su-25 and do your math. your "this is western propaganda" message is based 100% on russian propaganda which over the course of last and this year have changed their view of events dozen of times, produced fake pictures of Su-25 etc, etc.
if that doesn't trigger your bullshit-alarms then there is no point in continuing this discussion, because you're pretty set on believing whatever russia says is complete truth without doing any research and analysis of facts.
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:25:48

oh of course it is and absolutely not because of jews but because of how cynically putin is abusing the brainwashing that was so effective in nazi germany to support his kleptocratic regime. putin has no ideology  but enriching himself and his small circle of friends.

by throwing literally millions of people into the meatgrinder. it really is an amazing achievement to have more losses in that war than almost all other regional forces combined.

1) the hashrate was dedicated to finding that block, which means that hashrate was not mining some shitcoins during that time. hashrate is what secures the network and gives bitcoin value.
2) between realizing there's new block in the network at time `T` and constructing new block for mining at time `T'` some time passes `dt`: `T' = T + dt`. during that `dt` all miners *do nothing*, they literally waste time, which potentially costs the pool 12.5BTC every 10 minutes. so instead of making miners wait for new block with all the transactions, pool operators send out the empty base block for mining before they start working to add transactions to it. it's a totally valid strategy for minimizing losses and there is nothing wrong with it.
so i'm fine with empty blocks.

your words:


if TA does make such claim then it's possible to be statistically beating the market using TA. but you can't do that, therefore the claim is dubious.
then again you can always claim that TA that loses "isn't proper TA" or "wrong TA" and enjoy the self-fulfilling prophecy of always winning TA, it's just nobody can seem to figure out which TA it is.

chain size right now is roughly 150GB, 1MB blocks amount to static 50GB growth per year so after 3 years chain growth will already be below 17%.
are you saying blocksize should be pegged to that rate of change number, so you would only be ok with 1mb blocks in 3 years time?

it is much harder to take shortcuts in Haskell than in PHP and resulting shortcuts are still orders of magnitude safer.
the argument "we need a large community of developers" is mostly coming from hypers who value brand recognition more than long term usefulness.
i realize that it is a free market and anybody can program whatever they want, so we're stuck with ETH-like projects around, i just hope that if enough people put effort into it we can raise awareness about inherent problems with such approach.

So now you didn’t even mention the word crisis and went on to explain some obscure point using “high demand”. Oh boy...
Also, high demand is part of every bubble. What differentiates bubbles is sudden drop of that high demand and subsequently prices and subsequent realization of irrationality of the high demand in the first place. Are you trying to argue none of that happened in the tulip event?

right, so as long as we're on the same page, i still think it's a scalability problem for bitcoin to be raising blocksize whenever they fill up. for one that breaks the assumption of blockchain growth linearity, so storage does become a problem. but there are other aspects - there are IO constrains, CPU constrains, RAM constrains.
if you think about Visa scale - Bitcoin has barely started scratching the surface. personally i don't believe blockchain is the medium to replace day to day transactions. it's a great solution for where security, decentralization and oppression resistance are essential, but i think everybody claiming they want their coffee purchases on blockchain didn't really give it much thought.

Formal verifiability is like theorem proving in mathematics, except the subject is not some math object but a program code (smart contract code).
Without formal verification there is no way of being sure the code does what authors say it does. Even authors cant be sure the libraries they use werent spoofed. There could be bugs, etc.
Problem is that to be able to prove theories about code, the language has to adhere to many rules. Ethereum’s adheres to prwtty much none of them.
@_date: 2017-10-31 10:22:35
respectfully i disagree. freedom of contract is a great thing but if your language of contract is not strict it turns into freedom of shooting yourself in the foot. cryptocurrency developers have a responsibility before their users and ethereum devs shit on that responsibility.
"as long as people are aware of trade offs" doesn't help millions of those that were, are and will be parted from their money *solely* because of fault of developers of cryptocurrency.

300gb in first 2 years of operation. expect exponential growth, so next 2 years will be 600gb. and if they fix cpu issues, 2 years after that - 1.2 more tb. how many years do you expect it to last?

I’m speculating now - hunch is that proving correctness of code executing on a VM not specifically designed to be formally verifiable will only cover correctness within the spec of the VM.
In other words if you make verifiable language for ethereum VM, in he end the (verifiable and correct) code in that language will compile ibto VM bytecode. VM bytecode itself is a program that can’t be verified because VM wasnt designed for it.
So no, i dint think ethereum will get verifiability without changing the VM.

just a slight correction - it wasn't part of the initial design, it was an anti-spam measure and a temporary one.
however i do agree that the limit should be as low as possible to do the task, it's just not easy to define what does "do the task" really means because of conflicting priorities (miners want money, people want cheap transactions, and so on).
i totally understand the effect of increasing block size limit on hardware requirements on full nodes, it's just worth really thinking very hard about what should the right block size limit be *if* all stakeholders of the bitcoin system agree that 1mb is arbitrary and probably not ideal.

your point?
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:16:10
does not bear any scrutiny
a) **every** country has **many** citizens suffering from certain stage of radical nationalism
b) in **every** country these people are the first to participate in any unrest
c) in **every** country some of these people are part of army/police/etc
none of these points mean that every country in the world is nazi though, so why should it mean Ukraine is nazi?
also majority of countries in the world are **not being invaded** by a neighbour - so naturally they do not suffer from increased activities of aforementioned radical nationalists. do you think if **your** country was invaded there wouldn't be any radical young men willing to go to war zone to defend it?
and last point - both radical far-right parties "Svoboda" and "Right sektor" failed to pass latest parliament elections and also failed to even make a blip on a radar in last presidential elections.
it is obvious that ukrainians do not support far-right parties and i would go as far as to say far-right support is among **lowest in europe**.

yes, it is that too. and i like how you put order in quotes in an effort to completely diminish the value of concept of government.
when you're that biased against the concept from the beginning there is no way for you to have a discussion - you're not considering options.


government protects my rights. when there is conflict - government interferes. there is no way for magical only-good-intending company to not do that if there is conflict going on.


more slogans


so they don't claim the right. but who is there to ensure they don't violate that "rule"? what is the value for malicious agent in abiding that rule and not conspiring with other malicious actors to create a more powerful "competing" entity which will in the end take over and become the government?

we're not talking about ZERO violation.
who and why would ensure basic rights of people that have no money are not violated? who would resolve disputes? who would oversee dispute resolution isn't unfair? who would enforce whatever comes out of dispute resolution?
my point is - you're still arguing for a centralized government albeit on smaller scale. and that is all fine and dandy until a larger conflict begins in context of which small scale governments get trumped by evil empires. this is why we need a global world government. this is what UN is trying to do (successfully or not - this is debatable).

it has been working fine while we're at pretty much point zero on the adoption road. we should totally prioritize all and any efforts to make block space usage more efficient, but at some point 1mb *will* be too small. alternatively at some point we will realize 1mb is too large.

now lets imagine we've teleported to your world - everything is provided to you by a competitive agent that seeks to profit from services it provides. you're one of those unlucky enough to not be able to produce any value. where do you get your fresh water from? where do you get roads from? education for your kids? basic medical help?

a minor static fee for placing an order would help much more though - those 0.1 orders really flood the system

enterprise is exactly the reason why java gets bad rep. it only associates with bloat, slowness and bureaucracy in today's fast moving development world. "oh no we can't use this library, it's not 1.5Gb code, it compiles in less than 3 hours, it hasn't been around for 20 years and therefore is not secure enough"

this indeed is one of bitcoin's benefits. yay

buy low, sell high.
or if you believe in the concept of such money - buy and don't sell.

if you have private key for an address you can access coins behind it
address is public part of public/private key pair

mtgox waits for 6 confirmations to accept your coins
6 confirmations means 6 blocks must be generated which on average is 1 hour but can wildly vary
either in your bitcoin client or on blockchain.info you can go and see status of your transaction - it will tell you how many confirmations it has

If you believe in something it has high value to you -maybe that's why you wouldn't sell?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:40:48
because that has already happened multiple times over past weeks with less noticeable effect?

indeed that was my mistake. sha256 is still susceptible to more generalized grover's algorithm and ECDSA is based on a problem that is susceptible to Schor's algorithm even if it's not prime factorization.

hashrate already dropped 15%+ judging from bitcoincharts

ok so it's not a standalone wallet
if coinbase is exposing transaction id to you try to look for it here:  id&gt;
if it's not exposing or transaction is not registered at blockchain - you probably need to contact coinbase because it really takes seconds for unconfirmed transaction to be propagated through network

for $500 you will not afford anything that will mine you more than what you can buy for $500
mining is the longterm investment and it will only be worth it if you're buying some top of the line rig as with all the attention BTC is getting now there will be on order of magnitude more hashing power thrown into system and your pitiful $500 mining rig will earn you cents if even that per day
@_date: 2013-05-19 07:55:52
a) ecdsa is not susceptible to Shor's algorithm though it is susceptible to more generalized one
b) bitcoins are divisible to 0.000000001 part and it only takes a good fork to change that arbitrary limit(fork might crash bitcoin but it's not as doomed as you think)
c) there are many more valid reasons to use bitcoins (notice i used word *use* and not *invest*) one of which being battle-testing a currency of future. because even if it's not gonna be bitcoin it will be something similar.

1 5850 is about 120Mhps on my imac right now - more doing that for fun than for profits
also it keeps me from playing games - i finally started doing something useful!

and your charts are stocks vs currency - why does that apply better?

because doubling number of machines doubles performance and throughput of system running of them.. right.. you're obviously clueless.

so is C and C++ and python and ruby and even javascript


you base this statement on what? you measure usefulness how? only one of many many counterexamples: android usage will only be growing for many years from now and android is java.


first of all it's not something average person will decide, java is put on every android phone without average person's consent. second - it does not have to be on average person's pc to be useful, you can't even imagine how many devices have java running on them. and of course servers! i'm sure even reddit itself has java running critical bits of their infrastructure.


java itself is perfectly safe. java web browser plugin is not java.
P.S. there are many good reasons not to use java under certain circumstances but you apparently don't know any

sadly new paradigms rarely get accepted because their opponents become enlightened, rather they[opponents] die out and become a minority.
actual quote: a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. (c) Thomas Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.

Any "social" order will be forcing something on someone. Not forcing anything means tolerating crazy people eating your babies and tapping them on the shoulder "go on mate, here's pepper".

since when brilliant mathematician also means
* brilliant c++ dev
* brilliant network dev
* brilliant crypto dev
* brilliant protocol designer
not saying satoshi is brilliant in all that - i don't know, but it's what numerous articles about how "brilliant" bitcoin is are implying

i will never stop believing in concept of decentralization, therefore i will always see value in bitcoins. just as i see the value in torrents and git. (btw do you know what git is and have you watched it overtake other cvs just in couple of years?)

yes, there is correlation between fees and confirmation time taken for transactions
