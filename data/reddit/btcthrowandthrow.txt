Tough is right.  That's real money on the table.
We're doing fine financially, very little debt, both work, no kids.  I've been in the game since 2012, so no, I don't stay glued to the threads or tickers (though I'd be lying if I said this last week wasn't distracting).  I've pretty good awares of this thing.  I already lived through previous missed highs. :)
The house doesn't need to be payed off, I was making mention of it simply because it can be.   But it does get to a point of thinking, well hell man, how much is enough, which brought me to the 2 mil mark.  This of course isn't firm, just a staring point.  One could retire with dividends and equities at that rate (I'm in my 40s).  I wouldn't stop working per se, but having options is nice.

Thanks for the article.  I do feel I have a strong understanding of the tech and am a true believer... which makes it even harder to step off the train.
I guess its a matter of profit taking and having a plan or reason to do so, other than I can.  I agree, its very tempting to pull that chunk out and see what happens; but I'm thinking, even if futures dings the price, it's how bitcoin recovers or adapts financially that is fascinating.  It's truly bageresque.  Being part of that is kinda historic.
I've found it odd there hasn't been much reflection on the stay or play in this sub, other than HODL or 'I'm out'.

Thank you for saying so, I feel I will be too, but I don't discuss it much so it's nice to hear.  My wife is all about letting it ride, considers it found money, so that feeds my optimism (greed) I suppose. 
Like your stock example, getting out is a definite win.  It's hard to argue with definite.  You've given me something to contemplate.

About 12 to cover capital gains and pay off house.  would leave me with 11 left.
