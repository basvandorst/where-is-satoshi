I wouldn't send money or bitcoins to a shell corporation. Too risky.

GHash.IO started in July 2013. So it takes less than a year and not much money.

Good question. The website doesn't tell. It only gives an address:
5 Jupiter House
Calleva Park, Aldermaston
Berkshire RG7 8NN
That address hasn't the best reputation. It's known to host shell corporations, at least some of them connected with fraud.

Yes, I want my Nigeria connection scam audited as well!

The price is given in USD not in bitcoin?!?

None of my friends is so broke that they need $2 immediately. They all have enough small change in their pockets to at least buy a meal. ;-)

So we have a letterbox company "audited" by some Stefan.
Not very impressive.
I wouldn't send any money or bitcoins to them.

Many times. The money arrives the next workday. No transaction fees charged.
It's called online banking.

Which jurisdiction was it that accepts bitcoin for bail? $2?

The rich entity (Goldman-Sachs, JP Morgan and others come to my mind) doesn't even need to invest in expensive hardware. They could just as well setup a mining pool with a nice name and very favourable conditions for the miners. It just needs to be more favourable than any other pool.

And a Valetta/Malta shell corporation address.
I wouldn't send any money or bitcoins there.

In reality it's often more like this:
1. Sender ($) =&gt; Bitcoin Trading Company
2. Bitcoin Trading Company (BTC) =&gt; Sender
3. Sender (BTC) =&gt; Bitcoin Clearing Company
4. Bitcoin Clearing Company ($) =&gt; Receiver

I prefer sending my money to Nigeria anyway.

Wrong. Hint: SEPA credit transfer.

If this is important for you, switch your bank. Nordea for example has free EU transfers (if you do it via Internet).

Hiding behind a virtual office address. I don't trust you at all.

MSCI World made +19,52% over the last three years. BTC had a loss over that time.
So there's a difference between "better investment" (relative value) and "good investment" (absolute value). And you usually want a good absolute investment, not just be marginally better than some of the worst investments.

There's nothing wrong with printing money.
