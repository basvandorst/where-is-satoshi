@_date: 2017-11-27 10:15:59
So accurate ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:46:59
No hes smart, whats your problem?
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:18:25
Dont try time the market, i learnt over time that theres no point waiting for dips because you never know when they will come by and in that time you might or will be wasting profit that you could of been getting by investing the full 100% - no point in timining the market- just know in long term (1-2 months) youll have good profit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:39:46
Yes !!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:56:01
My ass ;)

You only have to pay tax if u declare the amount , if they ask were it came from which they most likely wont since banks dont want trouble other then people storing money in their bank, you can say your profit was only like 10$ etc &amp; they wont know how to check ur profits.

Ive always relied on my own research and no one elses, every one should believe in their own gut and invest- my research tell me that bitcoin has a strong future ahead.
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:24:21
Yes i bought bitcoin for a long term investment.... i dont understand why you dont undertand the logic in that. Learn up the definition of "long term investment" .
@_date: 2017-09-19 12:20:17
Your saying it like a 16 year old as me should have spare money 
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:35:53
I tend not to waste my time watching long vidoes on people talking about bitcoin as its a gamble, Trust your gut through your own research and not fall back on a "professional" because no one in the world can know what the future beholds. Take the bet and just hodl.

How can you assum that i dont pay rent ? And i dont know if your aware that what the minimum wage is for a 16 year old and how many hours i could even possibly fit into my week of studies to even have a decent saving.
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:23:31
Its alright, im hodling onto my bitcoin and am planning to keep it for years.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:28:37
Its all a gamble, you cant predict what the future beholds so theres no point of getting so deep into information as anything is possible at any second to effect the price of the market, and i chose to invest in altcoins because every coin starts small then becomes the wow factor after a year or two, its you type of people that dont have a great vision of the future of these smaller alt coins and then regret not investing when they hit "10-100$"- i advice you to research in altcoin , especially the ones i have invested in as "Nxs" has big plans for the future and is worth looking into.
And secondly, the china ban was something no one saw coming, even if we did we wouldnt of known it would of crashed the market that much, but if you look at previous articles of previous china bans, its always a short term issue and after always makes bitcoin rocket back up.

Well your accusations are wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:53:50
Agreed, time is money
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:37:47
Yes, digital.
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:44:07
Who said im a trader, im a long term investor. And there is no such thing as to know when to step into the market, believe your own gut and invest. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:07:43
I hope im rich after im done with education!
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:54:54
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:44:05
No, why?
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:53:54
I bought it at 4800, im just ignoring the dip and hodling��
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:40:39
Bitcoins increase rate has been going up so much this year, all i needed was a simple insight of past graphical information on how good bitcoin was going which was enough information for me to understand that i shouldnt waste "months" and research but instead jump in the boat and hope for those "months" to pay off. Time is money in the crypto world. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 20:22:01
Im not some future teller who can predict a dip was to come in the future. No one knows.
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:43:30
Agreed
