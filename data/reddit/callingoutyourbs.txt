Don't be ridiculous. I'm sure they took the time to have a good laugh before saying no.

It's not the banks job to do that for you. It's not the bank's responsibility to solve your problems for you. You act like because you want something there MUST be a way to get it, and when there is something in your way then organizations (i.e. the bank) MUST help you. There isn't always a way, and they don't have to help you.
"but how will I" is NOT an argument that the bank needs to help you, as you seem to want to use it.

I think he's pointing out that even if somehow it made it to the courts, it'd still go absolutely no where.

Here, let me save everyone some time with all these questions.


Doesn't matter, that's your responsibility not theirs.

DOESN'T MATTER, THAT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, NOT THEIRS. If you can't figure it out, that's your problem, not theirs.

Brilliant! Maybe they could take some people's money in order to finance more projects too, in return they would pay a smaller interest to the people whose money they're holding. 
Haha! Take THAT banks!!!!

Yes, the minimum cash wage for tip employees is 2.13. That means they are always paid $2.13 /hour, no matter if they make a billion dollars in tips.
On top of that IF they do not make enough tips to bring them to minimum wage, the employer must make up the difference. So no matter their tips, they are making minimum wage. The statement they're making &lt; $2/hour by OP was wrong even if they made no tips and the employer ignored the law saying they had to pay the difference. 
What part of that are you saying is incorrect?
Again: 


That's the federally mandated minimum wage that must be reached. Regardless of how shit their tips are, they will be paid that much if the employer is not violating the law.
So no, I don't think I'm not understanding the data.

Either because it's off topic to the original post, they don't want to publicly debate it, or they want to be insulting and not risk downvotes.

Not in the United States they don't. With zero tips, they should be getting minimum wage. Federal law. It also requires more than $2 as a minimum even if the employer is breaking the law with regard to tips.
Furthermore, in some places, the real minimum wage is required. For example, in CA they get the same minimum wage as anyone else. So lets not give statements about how required it is based on your inaccurate understanding of wages.
I tip well. I tip 20% when my soda was never refilled and my order was wrong twice. That's the minimum. However, every time I see someone act like it's *my* responsibility to make up their wages, I'm a little less inclined to continue that practice.
I'm not stealing their damn money if I don't tip well. It's my money. It's not our responsibility to make up for the shit laws. If **they** want it to chaneg, they should call up their congressman. Don't act like I have to fix their life because I wanted a fuckin burger.
To all the downvoters, explain yourself. Please explain why it is my responsibility to pay for the shit laws. Explain how OP was correct to make a factually incorrect statement that they are paid &lt;$2.00 (which is wrong even if the employer is breaking the law regarding making up for tips if they are not bringing the employee up to minimum wage.)
OP made statements that are factually incorrect in more than one way, and gave an argument based on them. Why do I get downvoted for pointing out his statements were flat out wrong?
If you get ZERO tips you are required by federal law to be paid $7.25. It is not legal, in the united states, for a tipped person to be making under $7.25/hour counting tips.
Edit2: I guess people just can't handle the truth. I get further downvotes, while the guy who responded to me with a statement that is **flat out wrong** gets upvotes. "Rawr, his correct statements disagree with my views, downvote. Ohh, but this guy made a statement that is wrong, but supports what I want to hear. Upvotes!"

Why do we need to change the management, not the employee?
That's my question. Why is all the onus on the customer, not the employer, the employee, and the government? Why is it the customers job to make up the difference, and the customer's job to change the laws?
Why is being a waiter so different from a mechanic, a programmer, a janitor, the front office worker in an apartment building, a cop, and 99% of jobs out there? We pay for them via taxes or for the services. Why is there an onus on the customer to pay differently for food?
If you respond, please address all the questions, and don't just pick and choose the ones you feel you can answer. If you don't have an answer, at least state that's why you're ignoring it.
I understand you feel waiters are underpaid, understand that I am not arguing against that. My questions are about why it becomes the customers job to make up for or fix that.
While we're at it, where did you get your "most make less than 2$/hour without them" statement when federal law requires they make $2.13 without any tips? As well as requires that if they don't make minimum wage that they are paid the difference up to minimum wage? Where did that claim come from, and why is it our responsibility to pay them if their employer is breaking the law?
If I'm an hourly software developer, and you buy my company's software after I was required to put in unpaid overtime to finish it, are you going to send me some money to make up for my employer breaking the law?

That's the side effect of stating disagreement ("So no") and clarifying what I'm disagreeing with ("I'm not understanding the data") using his phrasing. It's not even a triple negative, since the comma there separates the first negative from the rest of it.
Thanks for the snide remark. Going to throw any of those out to the user's that have made claims that were flat out wrong? Or just going to keep it limited to my choice of words since the rest of the post, the part with the actual point, showed I've been right the entire time?
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:26:30
I'm not missing that. I just don't think it's relevant.
I'm sorry, but "you should make up for my employer not paying me enough, because if it was fixed legally I'd have to pay taxes" doesn't strike me as a very good argument.
Yes, if I had a fixed perfect world, they'd have to pay taxes on their tips. Hell, I wouldn't even mind if they continued not declaring them, but they were optional because they were being paid an appropriate wage to begin with. 
However, you said I was being downvoted because I didn't understand the data. Seems like the goalpost has moved now that I've shown that I did understand the data just fine. Can we admit I'm being downvoted because I pointed out that OP used incorrect statements to support his popular opinion?
I mean, the defense here has turned to "Well, we can't hold the employer responsible for breaking the law, cause the employees are breaking it too!" and that's being used to support a claim that the customer needs to pay to make up for that. That logic seems all kinds of broken to me. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:34:40
For *part* of the US even. For California, for example, they're paid minimum wage before tips. 
Additionally, federal law mandates a $7.25 minimum wage. If they made zero dollars in tips, the employer is required to pay them &amp;7.25. If they're paid $3.00/hour, and make $1.00/hour in tips, they employer is required to pay an additional $3.25/hour to get it up to $7.25/hour
Oh you so silly. OP makes ridiculous claims, users point out how they are either flat out untrue (&lt;$2/hour claim) or incredibly misleading (tipping is the wage for waiters) and gets downvoted for it.
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:52:40
In practice I have never known a waiter that made under minimum wage, but that's beside the point.
I was just pointing out the ridiculousness of the premise of the argument of "everyone must pay tips" and that it's the customer's responsibility to make up for an employer breaking the law (from OP) being based on a flat out lie (his claim they were being paid &lt;$2/hour).
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:52:53
That is not correct. Those are not exceptions. They are still required to pay their workers the federal minimum wage.
For montana, it is the minimum cash wage that's below minimum wage. That's the amount that has to be paid not counting tips. If they got no tips, the employer has to make up the difference to get it up to minimum wage. That's the federal law I'm referring to (plus OP said they'd make under $2 an hour, which is below federal minimum even if the employer is breaking the law and not making up the difference.) 
That is, they are paid at least 2.13/hour (federal) or $4.00/hour (montana state, small business) even if they get a million dollars in tips. In addition to that, if that wage + tips/hour is less than federal minimum wage, they must be paid an additional amount to get them up to minimum wage.
The page you cited does not contradict my statement. They are required to be paid minimum wage, all that does is explain the different ways they can make it.


Federal law wins. They need to be paid $7.25 at least, after tips. So, if they get zero tips, they get $7.25. If the employer is breaking the law, then the employee should take it up with the employer, not expect the customer to do it. So even in Minnesota, Guam, Montana, and all the others my statement stands. Federal law is that they need to be paid minimum wage, whether that's through the employer or the employer + tips.
Edit: uhh, someone wanna explain me being downvoted? He said those states are an exception. They aren't. They are still required to pay minimum wage. My statement was correct. That's a fact. So why am I downvoted for it?
