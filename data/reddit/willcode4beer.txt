My apartment (bay area) won't accept rent in cash or check. They only allow direct bank transfer.
OTOH, last time I went home to FL, it was like going back in time. I saw a lady write a check for her groceries (hadn't seen that in well over a decade)

Next up: they try to liquidate the bitcoins via MtGox and the transfer is perpetually *delayed*

I think this is the key part.
To support a bitcoin economy, we need to be buying and selling things with them. As they are traded for products and services, we'll see the exchange rates stabilize.
Simply investing creates a sort of pyramid scheme. Hoarding creates scarcity, scarcity drives up the price. As the price goes up so does demand. When folks start to "cash out" more coins hit the market pushing the price down. We could see others reacting to that buy selling (before it's too late) further pushing the price down.

How about just selling cheap USB keys with a bitcoin wallet on them?

How about just doing something about the list?

I lost some bitcoins when MtGox was hacked. Now I just keep them on a USB drive when I'm not actively trying to spend them.

As the military starts returning home and the economy recovers, I expect we'll see the price of gold go down quite a bit. Gold was trading under $300 back in 2K. Adjusted for inflation it should trade under $400 nowadays. Heck, even silver was trading under $5 back then.
Now, I don't know if bitcoin is the "best" thing to invest in though, it does seem to be doing pretty well as time goes on. But, I can't really see investing in precious medals at this time.

Everytime the media reports on how you can buy drugs over at silkroad with bitcoins the value jumps.

That would be 128 years.


Perhaps a bit of history is in order:

They'll probably denigrate it and let let it slide at the same time since it can be useful for the government.
I'm reminded of this quote at the end of the movie Lord of War


It can give them a way to finance things that they'd prefer to keep out of the spotlight.
