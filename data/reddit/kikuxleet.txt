Yeah, that was my initial fear. I looked around and some other people who are using this wallet claim that there weren't issues with the withdrawal. It could be that I tried to take out the coins only one day after they were deposited in, so that this shady company is trying to prevent 'buyer's remorse' and confiscated the BTC.

Sorry I just have a quick follow-up question: earlier you said my Ledger BTC receiving address changes every time I make a transaction? Does that mean if tomorrow I receive BTC from, say, Binance, and a month later that scammy hot wallet decides to approve the transaction, does that mean my BTC address would have changed again by then and that old transaction wouldn't go through?

I think so, it's called Plus Token Wallet, I looked up and found that it's a Ponzi scheme, then immediately commenced the withdrawal.

 I looked up my Ledger BTC receiving address on Blockchain and it returns zero transactions... which is odd, because I have sent BTC to this address multiple times before

Ah, I understand, thanks again

Called Plus Token Wallet, that promises daily and monthly ROIs for HODLing coins on their hot wallet.

Hmm, it was not sent. No transaction of sending anything comes from this hot wallet...

Ah ok, then no transaction on my BTC account since the address change. If it's not even on the mempool, do you know if the transaction will eventually fail and the coins return to me? Unless someone is purposely holding the transaction.

The coins have been sent, it's no longer in sender's address. No TXID, no nothing, just says transaction is "auditing".

I see, thanks for your help. I guess that'll teach them a lesson for not storing coins in a Ledger in the first place.

So does that mean if most people expect BTC to go near 100k in the next couple years it's mostly not going to happen?
