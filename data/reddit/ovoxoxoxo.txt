Absolutely not.  Insider trading makes markets more efficient.

I don't think you understand the economic concept of efficiency. A price cannot be more *efficient* for one individual than another.  It seems like you might be equivocating the term with *fairness*. If it results (by any means) in a more accurate price as you admit, then it is by definition more efficient.


Little disagreement amongst academics.  Econlib is a very trusted source.  Check the citations.
