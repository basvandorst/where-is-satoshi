Building a nice base at 11k, everyone expects 9k so I think were due to a spike past 16k this week

Said that 2 years ago, this is essentially bitcoin becoming a bank if you understand how LN actually works. Completely centralised. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:45:41
Plot twist, this person is using stolen bitcoins they hacked years ago. They are now giving bitcoin out to make themselves feel better about what they did. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:18:47
Except bitcoin cash actually works, has low fees, extremely fast compared to bitcoin which you cant do shit with?
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:47:04
Korea have a limit of $50k per year to withdraw out of the country.. its impossible dude. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:11:42
ok good luck seeing that work in 2 years time while fee's will be $5000 by then and bitcoin cash would of taken most of bitcoins market cap.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:37:36
Trying to withdraw bitcoin to another wallet, it costs $23.. 
Can reduce the sat/b and it still come through, but just take a bit longer? How low can I put it to if I don't mind waiting a day?

@_date: 2017-10-19 17:33:12

You said "just a 700% increase". Apple's stock has increased more than 3600% from its inception, you don't see people even dreaming of a 10% year.. because they are professionals. 
I don't need to say more. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:54:23
Everyone on this sub are boring morons who told him to delete his account, it could of been an epic story.
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:53:30
They are into blockchain technology, the CEO of JP said anyone caught trading it would be fired. Jesus christ so much misinformation you guys are brainwashed with.

I sound sane. I don't follow this cult mentality most users here have.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:31:48
I like how when I criticise bitcoin in any way you people act like a cult and try to attack someone personally "issues with life" etc. Its clear signs of cult mentality. Feel sorry for you brainwashed folk, and I most probably have more bitcoins then 90% of everyone in this sub. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:50:16
Now imagine if you had opened a long position on a live account :)

"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he would fire any employee trading bitcoin for being “stupid.”"
Google is your friend you dumb fuck. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:50:37
So much irony in this given Buffet said Bitcoin is most probably a bubble.

You didn't pay attention much in economics much did you?
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:35:09
"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent"
Nope, I can never be so sure about peoples stupidity. But once the feds crack down on it, it'll be game over for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:46:56
You haven't even admitted to being wrong, you fully thought I made up a quote about JP Morgan. Now you're trying to divert to something else, you poor poor person. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:23:01
Poor baby upset I just owned you?

@_date: 2017-10-25 18:39:30
Making it illegal in the US. Just like the did online poker, all it takes is 1 legislation for it to pass, and bankers will bribe millions and millions for that :) Don't fight the gov, you'll never win. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:29:39
"Past Performance Is No Guarantee of Future Results". This is the number 1 rule in professional trading, you are a a delusional fool. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:38:32
What you just described is FOMO. Its what gamblers are diagnosed with. Do some research, don't just read posts here.
