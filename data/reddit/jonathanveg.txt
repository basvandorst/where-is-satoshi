Vish. I put in my "about" screen that my app is **not** official. I also send they a twit about it: 
I'v never tried to look at an Official app ;)
I wanna call their attention, but in the positive way haha 
@_date: 2016-08-31 15:41:33
I'm thinking about it. Not now, but I'm really considering this option.

Not in this first version. But it are in my plans. For the next version I wanna put a way for see you currencies and orders and, after, the trade mode.

So, you can trust me. I have no intention for getting out any information. But I understand you, mainly because you really don't know me and Poloniex deals with money.
But, as you can see, in the about screen I put my social networks (I'm active in it ~ Facebook and Twitter~). I'm really easy to be find haha :P

I don't think in it, not soon. I've created my first app (bittrex) more than one year ago and, till now, they haven't created one.
If poloniex wants to talk to me about my app I would like listen they haha :P 
And so, It's the v1, made this last weekend, I'll improve it

No, they don't have, but have a good website, as the other guy commented.
But, I created an Android app using their public API. It has a post here in reddit: 
If you wanna take a look, just check this link out:

Hey guys, I have an app for bittrex. I created another thread here for this: 
@_date: 2016-09-22 16:11:29
Hi. I looked in the API and this infos are given. But I don't have loans there, so I don't know what is really useful for this.
Please, contact me for helping to develop this part of my app.

I've sent an email for the Poloniex Founder. Now, I'm sure he knows about my app (he already answered).

Hi, my name is Jonathan. I'm a Brazilian developer and Bitcoin lover. 
I've created an Android app using your public API and would love listen your opinion about it.
I also created a thread for this in Reddit¹ about my app. There, they talked about a Twit² from Poloniex and, because of this, I decided to send this email. Firstly to let you know about my app and second to say I'm clearly not trying to pass like a official app.
The link to Play Store: 
Thanks for your time.

ps: It's a little bit ugly, I did it literally in the last weekend haha :)

Hummm interesting your use case. I've not think about it.
I'll see if the current API gives me this information and, if yes, I'll do it!
But, once I have no coins there for this, can you be a "beta tester" for me? 
If yes, please email me: jonathan.jgs
Thanks for your feedback. :)
