circle is far more [convenient]( without a premium on fees.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:24:35
circle is far [better]( i compared coinbase.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:16:58
beginners and average users don't want or need to be creating additional unnecessary accounts such as GDAX, especially for trading.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:28:28
as OP pointed out, coinbase is the focus. beginners and average users don't want or need to be creating additional unnecessary accounts such as GDAX, especially for trading.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:02:37
there's still a 1.49% service fee to buy bitcoin with the coinbase USD wallet you do the free ACH transfer to.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:26:18
no, there was never any reason to use coinbase, circle is far [better]( circle has no fees and is faster, the 1% fee you're thinking of is their buy price markup, coinbase has it too on top of their service fees.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:01:57
circle has 1% markup buy price vs spot price, coinbase does too on top of their 1.49% service fee for bank account or 3.99% for card.

@_date: 2016-08-06 21:49:13
circle has a price spread for amounts above $3000, below that the sell and buy price is the same.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:46:25
the instant buy limit and fees for circle is far [better](
@_date: 2016-04-30 06:32:01
coinbase will kick you off too if they find out you're gambling.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:49:23
coinbase is even more terrible now. circle is far [better](

@_date: 2016-08-06 22:15:53
buying through coinbase is another reason, their fees are high and they're slow and they cancel purchases after making you wait up to a week, especially when the bitcoin price goes up. even their instant buy purchases aren't always instant.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:44:15
they didn't take it away, it's 1.49% now.
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:41:25
coinbase exchange is for traders. circle locks the price too. circle shows the price and rate when you type in an amount. i compared coinbase to circle, both allow the average user to buy bitcoin instantly with debit card, but the differences are clear and factual.
@_date: 2016-08-25 00:43:03
your comments here show just how terrible coinbase and their mindset is, circle is far [better]( coinbase doesn't even have a customer support number but circle does and it's for *all* their customers, not their *best*. and your smiley emoticon in your comments here is mocking users.
@_date: 2016-04-30 05:04:42
inaccurate comparison since with coinbase OP is buying with a bank account which is 1% fee and with circle he's buying with a debit card which is 0% fee. for coinbase buying with a debit card is 3.75% fee so the fees in the pic would be $16.95 making circle even more cheaper. also the price comparison isn't at the same time, a minute difference but still.
@_date: 2016-04-28 22:24:11
[coinbase with debit card is still worse than circle](
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:57:00
another point, coinbase doesn't have USD wallet available for all US states, circle does.
your 3.75% fee and $40 limit is terrible...
edit: added more points to post.
@_date: 2016-08-10 23:27:14
i have coinbase but won't use them, i vote with my wallet and use circle, it's far [better](
@_date: 2016-04-29 02:18:49
section 18 of the [user agreement]( got updated.


so sites like localbitcoins aren't allowed with circle.
@_date: 2016-04-29 05:44:52
what chapter of the ToS?
@_date: 2016-04-29 18:07:52
you can't open a coinbase account or coinbase USD wallet? what state?
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:30:35
did you send directly from circle to the gambling site or vice versa?
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:40:23
those times are why.
@_date: 2016-04-30 05:56:21
gambling is actually covered under section 18.
@_date: 2016-04-30 05:24:20
circle does, and actually for coinbase if you switch from the app to something else and back, the price changes, circle doesn't do that.
@_date: 2015-12-03 22:57:33
coinbase has fees and doesn't let you use a debit card to instant buy, circle is the opposite. the coinbase referral program isn't appealing either.
shift has a card issuance fee, not appealing.
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:45:07
i sent **$1** from uphold to my wallet over **5** hours ago and it still hasn't shown up... i now opened a support ticket too...
also why didn't you upload your screen capture to imgur or similar? i'm not downloading a file just to see it...
edit: support emailed back to say there was a delay. the bitcoin showed up **16** hours after i sent it.
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:03:03
did you copy part of my comments?
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:41:33
that was for selling 10 btc.
for buying right now 10 btc:
coinbase with bank account **1%** fee
BTC 10.00
USD 6,103.00 
Fee $61.03
Total $6,164.03
circle with bank account or debit card **0%** fee
$6,107.23 at 1 BTC = $610.73
coinbase with debit card **3.75%** fee would be even more expensive.
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:24:04
i have both circle and coinbase and won't use coinbase but use circle for 0% fee.
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:51:05
what happened with your atombit account?
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:34:08
3.75% for credit and paypal.
@_date: 2016-06-22 17:50:07
3.75% fee for credit card instant buy bitcoin, same as for debit, circle is cheaper with 0% for debit and 2.9% for credit.
3.75% fee to sell bitcoin for paypal with photo ID upload, circle should add paypal with 0% fee as same as to sell bitcoin for card and bank account. edit: why can't the fees be 1% across the board? and the daily limit for debit/credit card instant buy be raised from $40? current fee and limit is terrible. i have coinbase but won't use due to that.
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:39:52
no large amounts, all under 0.1 btc, and no drugs or anything circle doesn't allow.
@_date: 2016-06-22 18:35:54
says instant but 3.75% fee and lower limits.
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:02:34
thanks, updated. is the paypal payment sent as friends and family which is free, or goods and services which is 2.9% fee?
@_date: 2016-06-20 06:33:45
circle is right though, you were gambling on nitrogen sports from your reddit profile. and circle has two factor authentication, so how did you not get the notifications? and circle also emails transaction notifications, so again the same question. @_date: 2016-06-20 19:35:30
no. circle is far better. [coinbase with debit card is still worse than circle](
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:27:07
i've compared regularly and even right now, circle always pays far more.
BTC 10.00
USD 6,236.50
Fee $62.36
Total Payout $6,174.14
$6,281.35 at a price of $628.13 = 1.0000 BTC
if you have both coinbase and circle, check for yourself.
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:05:56
can you explain why this happens and also have weekend support?
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:55:55
3.75% - 2% = 1.75%
1.75% isn't 1%
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:49:36
looks like your bank is to blame, inform circle and coinbase.
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:17:24
when you bought on circle did you send the bitcoin out of circle? is your real name on circle and does it match the name on the debit card? is the debit card yours? did you apply for a limit increase on circle and use your real info? did the debit card flag your circle purchases?
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:16:13
hardly. [coinbase with debit card is still worse than circle]( coinbase doesn't have USD wallet for all US states, circle does. a bitcoin debit card (shift) is the main thing coinbase has that circle doesn't, but the bitpay visa card is far better. coinbase might be cheaper to buy bitcoin by bank account which isn't instant, but circle is far cheaper to buy by debit card which is instant. circle also pays far more for selling bitcoin. i have both circle and coinbase but won't use coinbase as seen why.
@_date: 2016-06-22 21:05:02
i've bought and sold on circle, there are no hidden fees. there'e even a Circle Fee line clearly shown.
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:29:29
the credit card will have to offer rewards higher than coinbase 3.75% fee to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-15 01:24:41
is coinbase aware that up to a week ago card transactions for US users were processed by coinbase in the US instead of the UK as of now, which is why now card transactions for US users are having issues and there's also an extra 3% foreign transaction fee charged for US users by their card? is coinbase restoring card processing in the US for US users?

edit: 3 hours now...
edit 2: confirmed.

you're going to get your chase account chargebacked and closed, just like your [paypal]( and [google wallet]( accounts.
and your comments like [this]( don't help you.


@_date: 2016-05-15 11:16:52
no, shapeshift isn't peer-to-peer.
@_date: 2016-05-15 11:48:58
changetip does since on reddit last week they said credit card orders usually take about 24 hours.
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:11:23
the keyword in the section is "individuals", you're not selling bitcoin to individuals or buying bitcoin from individuals on shapeshift.
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:14:58


what site? was it for illegal drugs from your profile?


you heard wrong. circle will ban you too for illegal drugs.
@_date: 2016-05-15 11:43:47
circle doesn't ask for ID unless they choose to for a specific user.
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:32:55
they don't have instant buy. @_date: 2016-07-29 22:12:19
can you link to that?
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:55:28


what post? i see much more hate for coinbase than circle for good reason.
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:44:49
what message?
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:44:40
circle. it's the first best option.
