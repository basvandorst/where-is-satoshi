fees are priced in Satoshis. I've been paying .000025 for years. Peeps today say I'm over paying, last December I was paying too little. I have never had a problem. yes, sometimes it takes a week, when blocks are full.
But no matter what, no matter how much you pay, when blocks of full.. many many many many transactions are not going to get in. the problem is the wallets and the assumption that higher fees get you in the block quicker. 
a complete misunderstanding of Bitcoin causes the entire Community the quote fees in dollars, and to write terrible fee estimations into wallets, causing people to pay outrageous prices for no reason

Im pretty qualified, been trading futures since the early 90s and was the first person to tweet hashtag $btcusd 
The current futures contracts at CBOE and the CME will be a disaster in my opinion. It will have no effect on bitcoin, but will not end well for the CME and CBOE or anyone with major "arbitrage" hedges on. 
Im not going-to go into all the details, but the main issue is the lack of delivery. All physical commodities have physical delivery settled futures. Its the only thing the truly keeps these futures contracts anchored to the spot price. 
Cash settled futures, is ok for financial products like S&amp;P, Bonds, or Currencies.  In this context, bitcoin is much more like Corn, Soybeans, Gold and Silver, then like Japanese Yen , or Eurodollars 
I open to starting a futures exchange that will do it right, if anyone is interested. I've had all the code and design for a couple of years now. 
anyways, that my .02

the Wikimedia foundation is already very long USD. You should not convert the BTCs to USD, this way there is some kind of rainy day hedge on the Feds printing presses. 
on the other hand coinbase makes all its revenue from the fees on the conversion, so the best way to "give back" would be to convert. 
also by converting you avoid having to secure your wallet or trust a third party, until you know a bitcoin as well as you know a 1 dollar bill.

no, there is no defense other than to go Proof-of-Stake which may still be called bitcoin... 
other option is to change the POW algorithm.. but this plan will just cause all the SegWit miners to bail.. causing the fork to happen faster

pure PoS. and yes it will make centralization worse... but this is not intended to ever get activated. Its a poison pill.. a last line of defense.. its gets activated just before the sword will be stuck in bitcoins heart. 
its an extreme measure, but if put into the code, it will cause miners to stop signaling BU - and will never get activated  
just like US Nuclear Bombs aimed at Russia is mutually assured destruction, it works as a deterrent - and ends in a stale mate 
picture this - out of no where BU hits 85% and forks, and then instantly attacks BTC with 51%, what is the defense? This is not Hypothetical this is real, happening now. 
also this is just a starting point.. we can say things like - after x blocks we move to POW-x16 - and these miners can then use these block rewards to replace those useless sha256 rigs with new x16 rigs, and we switch back to POW 
there are many ways this can work. but the details are not really important, whats important is that this is a deterrent and will never be activated! 
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:42:48

This is all under the assumption that BU as a whole is completely technically incompetent, want to control bitcoin, and will make it completely centralized. 
If you believe that bitcoin will survive a BU takeover, then this is a bad idea! 
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:13:03
sorry I missed your question no. the threat of the core fork, will prevent the BU fork
think cold war - defense nuclear weapons - as a deterrent. there are other examples in Chinese central bank fx exchange. 
you put the code in, and the code will cause a fork only if BU forks with 80% plus hash rate..
just by having this code in will avoid this code from ever running. 
it's a poison pill - and it's objective is to avoid all the forks. 
this objective will be reached if 30% of the minors, don't want to get stuck mining a coin without any transactions which would be BTU, which is what our change the proof of SegWit  will do to any minors that haven't signaled SewWit
it's a little counterintuitive I'll try to fix the paper but check it out

PURPOSE IS TO STOP THE FORK FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE! 
its a deterrent 
i don't think you understand - its only gets activated when the Core coin is almost already dead. 
LAST LINE OF DEFENSE - after everything else did not work - Core will die at this point.  
think 
read what a poison pill is, and its objectives. 
think what the objective of BU is and the objective of a post fork 51% attack. 
use your imagination 
one hand you have: 100% chance BTU wins and BTC dead 
other hand: 70% chance stale mate / no fork and 30% chance BTU coin and a BTC POS   
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:58:32
our only hope is to stop the fork... vitalic is putting it in our heads that we should work together and have a smooth fork. 
we didn't lose 150 billion because of a bug in a turing complete brand-new programming language
we are sitting in our little homes are there is an army of giants surrounding us with weapons and we just tell each other - it can't happen "we are resilient"
trumps not gonna win
brexit is not gonna happen
either core has secret plans, and I would be thrilled if they did.. times like this you don't follow the rules of open protocols
remember the moment BU forks we now have 90% activation with whatever we want... so if we plan it right, we can have a whole slew of brand-new changes all the things, and it all gets signaled on the BU singnal
and if you make those changes compelling enough and you include the Segwit minors in the future of bitcoin then you have the scenario where we have a defensive weapon against an attacker with 80% – hash power, and using hash power not for his financial incentives but to attack us 
whoever says largest hash power wins is crazy especially after they just pulled a complete centralization move
never forget one CPU one vote was the intention of bitcoin from Satoshi
The sad part is that money on our side like record uncensored guys are proof of work zealots even though proof of work did not anticipate asics 
nor do they anticipate hundreds of stories of buildings inside Chinese call mines where Coles is being burned that's not on by the people burning them so there's no cost at all , relative to a US mining rig montana
this is a national security issue... trumps building up the military but he's letting that side of the world control one of the potentially biggest assets the world has ever seen.
got I just wish everyone will listen when many of us said we need to compete with the Chinese in the United States - One idea was to put little minors on every single router sold in the new United States as a start. 
this is why I been creating my own coin and I created this technique to enable bitcoin to keep going to continue even when all the miners shut off the equipment
I wonder if Satoshi himself will come and defend bitcoin by selling all his BTH taking the cash to buy BTC
even this won't be enough if double spending 51% is rampant. 51% could reverse six blocks of transactions? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:43:09
oh, i'm sure of it.. i have a feeling that 90% full nodes of being being blocked by NAT , think they are running relay nodes, it's really very FUBAR

@_date: 2017-03-07 10:32:20
One of the big secrets is that most "full nodes" running in US homes of "non-technical" peeps are behind NAT and are in fact not a relay / listening node, and are not helping bitcoin at all. 
I believe this is one of the biggest problems with bitcoin, I've tried bringing it up many many times... but nobody seems to care... 
if not for NAT we would have the 30k nodes that Luke-Jr is showing. see my post: 
@_date: 2017-03-18 09:25:41
it changes on same activation of BU block size fork. 
but the point is this is a poison pill that if done correctly will never get activated
The objective is to maintain the status quo, it's a defensive weapon for the BU attack. 
it's the last move before death... we have an armed attacker actively attacking bitcoin to try to steal $18 billion dollars. 
im still confident that bitcoin will survive
but I was screaming wolf right before Mt Gox
A couple of us were screaming wolf about the Chinese centralization of minors due to no electricity costs
any planed change of POW will remove all the rest of our segwit support 
remember a successful poison pill stops the attack
and the most important element of a good poison pill is the inevitable consequences
this takes it one step further... anyone who's ever found the block and has signal segwit gets his share  of the remaining bitcoin block rewards, everybody else gets nothing
remember this poison pill gets activated just before the sword goes  through our heart
but as BU activation gets closer and more inevitable mining with Segwit signaling becomes infinitely more profitable
and the minors will start switching to SegWit and we will hit a Nash equilibrium, below BU activation
stalemate - Cold War - status quo - a successful defensive weapon

@_date: 2017-03-19 18:29:16
BU is not a development team. BU is technically incompetent 
core is a distributed team , and there is healthy competition and Innovation and security through diversity.  
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:31:34
ok. the idea is a poison pill... a fork of core that gets activated at the same time BU signals and forks. this fork changes BTC from POW to Proof-of-SegWit (POSW) .. 
Long story short - POSW is a proof-of-stake consensus, but the stake that is used is the coinbase public-keys from blocks that did not signal BU 
so now you have two coins.. POW BTU - and POSW BTC ... assuming BTC retains the economic usage and has 80% of market-cap.. those miners who found blocks that didn't not signal BU will get all block-rewards and TX fees moving forward. 
This knowledge should cause BU signaling miners to stop signaling BU as BU gets closer to activation... thus never hitting activation... 
and we settle at some "NASH" Equilibrium below the BU activation... and thus fork never occurs.. which was the objective of this poison pill in the first place.. 
at the end of the day. this only gets activated when core already lost, so there is no real downside, and the upside is avoiding the fork  and subsequent 51% attack.

its only done after the fork just beore BTC gets hit with 51% attack - its the only defense 
also, by putting this in the code now as a poison pill, it will actually act as a deterrent, and stop the fork from happening.

@_date: 2017-03-19 04:46:04
many miners signaling BU, are not zealots. They know that if BTU fork fails to win market cap,  they can always just mine BTC.  
but if we take away that option to mine BTC, then they now have an  incentive not to signal BU. 
How do we take away that option to mine BTC? If we change from sha256 to x11 POW for example, then we are now also hurting those miners that are signaling SeqWit and risk losing them to BU .. so my plan explicitly gives this massive windfall to all miners that are not signaling BU. 
So we are using the fact that an economic majority is on the BTC core side, to stop minors from signaling BU. 
We use economic majority as a defense against hash-power and end in a stale-mate - cold-war

1) Bockchain is in itself is a design pattern. It inverts the client/server relationship, where clients do most of the work to obtain state. By only "serving" small pieces of data with eventual deterministic state, you now have a self-scaling event based timestamped and secure network.. and your server costs are down 90% 
2) Distributed trustless Consensus creates value, decentralization eliminates risk of central failure.   
3) Blockchains should only be used as a solution to a problem that can benefit from Blockchain.

The fundamental theory of finance is "no arbitrage". [ 
There must be an underlying reason for the different prices. Using this knowledge I was able to predict MtGox will go bankrupt and was able to move funds out a week before they collapsed. In order to do this I had to buy bitcoin at $1200, and transfer it to Bitstamp, where it was trading at $600.

no. fees are not in dollars, and there no fee market. the price of bitcoin is 1 bitcoin.. the price of a satoshi is 1 satoshi 
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:38:14
that site has been spotty for years, i would find alternatives. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 07:44:09
exactly, fees are independent of amount of the transaction
The big mistake is everyone constantly pricing things in dollars
A bitcoin has always, and will always be worth one bitcoin. 
A currency that is only used when quoted in a different currency, is not a currency at all! 
discussing fees and terms of dollars, makes absolutely no sense. because the network or protocol knows nothing about its external price. 
The fact that moving 1000 bitcoins takes the same number of bytes as moving 1 bitcoin , is known.
so if somebody says, I paid a 30% fee on my transaction, and another person says he only paid 1% on his transaction.. but they both pay the exact same transaction fee.. 
should he complain about that, it's not fair? nobody complains, because it's obvious. it's a fact. we all know that the percentages do not matter in bitcoin 
do you know what else doesn't matter in bitcoin? The price of the USDBTC exchange rate! 
"but it matters to me" you say? 
but it's a fact, that bitcoin fees are paid in bitcoin, and not in US dollars , maybe this is confusing and  too complicated that's what it is! 
bitpay and all these websites and services that Price bitcoin in native currencies is really what's holding back true adoption of bitcoin  as a true currency!

"using full nodes" . must they be full nodes or just be self validating? Many think they are running full-nodes, but with the majority of homes behind a NAT, most are not contributing much to the decentralized network. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:26:04
distributed, decentralized, self-scaling  - its all bullshit if only coders with static ips can contribute.

the absolute value of Moving Average (MA) is not important (for technical analysis). First thing to look at is if price is above or below the MA, this determines the trend.. so price is has been above the 200 day MA for a while, this makes the trend "bullish". 
When looking at highs and lows use price or VWAP (volume weighted average price.).. not sure these are avail yet for bitcoin
bitcoin price looks to be headed for all time highs above 1200, which brings us to uncharted territory, and a target above $10,000 within 18 months after breakout. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 02:44:17
even worse, most internet users are behind NAT
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:10:33
no, what if I want to run a full node to contribute to the decentralized relay system, and not to receive bitcoin payments. 
many "bitcoiners" run full nodes to "help" the network, w/o ever receiving any payments. nor do they ever intend to receive payments to their full nodes. when in reality they are just wasting bandwith bec they are behind NAT. 
mom and pop should be able to download blockchain software and run it out of the box, and it should contribute to the network by relaying messages. 
tcp/ip bind is a fundamental operation in computing. it boggles my mind that nearly 100% of US households are unable to do a simple bind without centralized help. 
NAT is the  barrier that is preventing mass adoption of a true distributed world. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:22:22
exactly my point. yes, im a coder, i can figure this stuff out. most of can as well. i actually have a static ip.. 
but this is now a barrier to true organic distributed network scaling. 
we need a simple way for every day non-technical users to get around this. maybe even a service that ranks ISPs based on usability with full-nodes  
@_date: 2016-12-20 04:45:10
r/blockchain 
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:27:20
i thought.. that the whole promise of (scaling) decentralized and distributed blockchain computing is that anyone with internet access and a powerful machine can join and contribute?
imo the biggest obstacle to blockchain value proposition (decentralization) is the technical knowledge barrier needed to run "full" full nodes. 
i really would love to see the bitcoin community actively embrace  IPV6, which would theoretically make NAT not fundamental to broadband. then we would need to change the whole (comcast, etc..) infrastructure to enable true tcp/ip where each device has a unique address. 
Luke, are there any other possible solutions? something like a decentralized "hole punching" service where NAT to NAT discovery would be seamless? Seems like its a chicken and egg.. cant have the decentralized service with the NAT and cant hole-punch w/o the service.
So the problem is technically impossible to solve.. but so was Byzantine Generals, and actually Byzantine impossibility proofs are still valid. 
Bitcoin is a practical and pragmatic solution to an impossible problem. We need more of these innovations.  
@_date: 2016-12-19 19:29:01
the holy grail is to have this as a decentralized service.. is this at all possible?  maybe with an embedded token .. on a blockchain? 
@_date: 2016-12-20 02:45:25
how many active connections? 
@_date: 2016-12-20 03:02:49
do we not like to use "blockchain" , because blockchain == bitcoin technology 
@_date: 2016-12-19 06:58:49
are you behind a nat, like comcast or att? if so, there is no way to simply bind to a port and listen to incoming connections. d
 
the problem is, what public ip address are you sharing with the network, so you can be found? the public NATed ip address will not work. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:54:46
its a start! To a brand new blockchain this would be a big advantage, not so much needed for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:06:27
rename it to bitcoind knots 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:11:20
Its just bad marketing. 
Luke, can you give us a sales pitch on why to use bitcoin knots (assuming we are running core already)  
i run core with -txindex 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:14:33
and how is running knots better for the network than running plain core? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:03:56
so how is bitcoin-qt compatible? 
also, do you want regular people actually using knots? or only bitcoin devs? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:07:49
who controls bitcoin.org ? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:34:05
thats sales pitch is a 1 out of 10!  seriously - i have looked at that already.  ok. 
what is bitcoin knots? exactly what executable is replaced vs core? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:24:29
do you prefer or care if anyone does use it? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:17:54
ok. and Mr, Consensus says to do some basic marketing/pr/packaging - "SegWit" was the worst marketed "product" of all time. i get that "SegWit" was never supposed to be contentious, or be a thing among non devs...  
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:36:33
how can it support bitcoin-qt? isnt bitcoind built into bitcoin-qt? so you can build bitcoin-qt with knots? 
or is knots a rpc server for bitcoin-qt? 
i dont know what bitcoin-tx is

no I've been in bitcoin since $1.99 , I admit I really don't know how to do it correctly... and if I had millions of dollars I would hire the best people to show me. 
almost all the major thefts have been from social engineering hacks resulting in compromised private keys, that were under the control of non-experts
guess who does hire the experts? that's right, exchanges like Bitstamp.l!
you're getting private key security in exchange for taking the credit risk of the exchanges
problem with Reddit is lowest common denominator thinking

@_date: 2017-10-10 23:00:05
yes liquid markets should not provide continuous arbitrage opportunities.. 
so when an arbitrage presents itself, it's a sign of some other risks and reasons for the price
in this instance MtGox was trading $250 and bitstamp was at $600. The question was why would people be selling at 250? at the time all withdrawals were already frozen! 
so my theory was that the market is expecting MtGox to shut down and go bankrupt, and traders would rather have USD claims to a possible future bankruptcy court, instead of BTC claims. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:00:34
like i've been saying for years.. for many people -  you are better off keeping coins ON AN EXCHANGE !! 
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:40:40
not only did I get out of MtGox just before they shut down the bitcoin withdrawals.. I actually posted this in bitcoin talk, I predicted a mtgox  bankruptcy based on the price difference to bitstamp and the fundamental no arbitrage theory in finance! 
so yes! your best bet is to find a good exchange with state-of-the-art security, monitor them for solvency.. and move your coins elsewhere on first sign of a problem! 
I would rather leverage a multi million dollar security operation on these new exchanges, then to rely on not getting hacked!

@_date: 2018-07-31 22:13:12
its not only legal everywhere its literally part of the rules. you can place a limit order, and you can cancel a limit order. nowhere else besides crypto to traders look at those "wall" charts.. lots of things done by crypto traders/exchanges are backwards which have been corrected in other markets decades ago.  not sure why crypto needs to reinvent every single wheel.

hashing power is meaningless, if they are building on an invalid chain!  Bitcoin would be the one with the 20% and short lived relief to all those miners who had trouble competing with asicboost.

so you want a to buy Bitcoin148 with LegacyBitcoin and visa versa? So an fx pair.. 148/Legacy 
its a cash FX market vs a Futures market - a different animal... 
I think a Futures market will give us the true value of the post forked coins.. but have not thought about  the fx options.. 
also 6 blocks is enough.. because 148chain will never reorg on the LegacyChain anyways 
@_date: 2017-06-05 08:08:10
LukeJr shows how we can split coins into 2: 
if reorg never happens - there are two coins... will you take .1 bitcoin for your bip148 coin? 
so post fork you will have 1.1 legacy-bitcoin and .1 bip148 coin, instead of 1 legacy-bitcoin and 1 bip148 token. 
if .1 is too low... how much would you sell it for? 
@_date: 2017-06-03 20:44:56

MtGox are in way over their head, and didn't have the balls to step up.
