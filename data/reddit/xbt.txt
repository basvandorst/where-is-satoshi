Over the past couple of years, I've watched many people use exchanges as they'd use a money market account. As Bitcoin's price has risen, the dollar signs in their eyes have occluded reason and common sense. 
When people get greedy, they let good sense slip out the door and engage in behavior that makes them lose something.

That's a personal opinion and not actual knowledge. The fact is, we have no idea what Coinbase does with personal info. They leave loopholes in their privacy policies for the sharing of info.

Horowitz is correct.
Banks didn't adopt the net until the late 90's. Even then, it still took a few years for the rest of the world to adapt to online banking via the web.
Banks and other finance entities are just starting to look at the blockchain as seriously as they looked at the web in the 90's. In another 5-7 years, blockchain based systems will be almost as commonly used as banking websites.
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:17:51
That just underscores my point. 
The fact that banks missed the blockchain at first and are only now adapting and adopting the idea shows the strength of the technology. They were all over telegraphy and the telephone back in the day which is one of the reasons those networks grew as they did.
To get back to the OP, the blockchain is perfectly analogous to packet switching. I'm very curious to see what the banks do with it.

I have a crazy dream.
If I had three million dollars, I'd buy the mortgages of 20 houses in my town and give the houses to the people already living there, assuming that the people had been living in the house and paying the mortgage for at least three years. In exchange for a free house, the recipients would have three conditions:
1.) Never borrow money against the house    
2.) Live in the house, without selling it or renting it out, for 15 years            
3.) Whatever their old mortgage payment had been (as they have no mortgage now), they'd pay half of that towards the mortgage of a friend, family member or neighbor.
With regard to (3), the idea here is that the twenty households, now free of debt, can devote half of what they had all been paying to support another ten households out of mortgage payments. In turn, those ten households can support another five in the same manner - two households paying the mortgage of one - and the five households can support two and then the two support one, making a total of 38 houses in this trust.
The idea behind this is reciprocity and [gift economy]( We've all been raised with the bizarre notion that some form of barbaric mercantilism is the highest articulation of economic activity that we can engage in. If I had three million dollars, I could improve my town by making life better for myself and for 38 other homes. It would have a network effect, especially after two or three years when a  debt-free, owner-occupied, self-supporting neighborhood began to bloom in the middle of my town. On top of all that, I'd have a different house to eat dinner in every night of the month.
That's my crazy dream if we make Bitcoin work.

Paper wallets are the safest means of storing your bitcoins.
Go to bitaddress.org and save the website to your local drive. It's javascript so it will run offline. 
Put the saved web page on a machine that never goes on the net. Generate some addresses and print the public and private keys to paper. Copy the public keys, put them on a USB drive and transfer them to your machine with net access.
Now whenever you want to save a coin or two, send them to one of the public addresses you just created. Since the private keys have never touched a network, you can be assured that those addresses are as safe as 256-bit encryption will allow.
To get coins back in the future, import the private keys back into your wallet using the 'importprivkey' command in Bitcoin-qt or whatever client you're using.

For one, Armory allows for offline transaction signings. The setup:
Computer1 is your online watching wallet running Armory. Computer2 is your offline Armory client holding your private keys.  Computer1 can create transactions but can't sign them. After creating the transaction on Computer1, the transaction is taken to Computer2 via USB drive and signed by the offline client. Then the transaction record is moved back to Computer1 for completion of the transaction.
It's the safest way to do biz online with a live wallet. Armory has a few other features that should be checked out. I'd love to see it come to OSX.

Not a miner, but Anenome5 is correct. This is how coins are created.
The first transaction in a block is called the coinbase and this allows for the miner to create a 25 btc transaction to himself if he finds the block. The entire network has to agree that the block was found and is correct but even then the miner has to wait for 120 confirmations before the coins can be spent.
What happened tonight is a good example of why 120 confirmations is the wait time.

Download the Satoshi client and learn the command line functions. It takes some learning but it's worth it to be able to explore the blockchain locally than to depend on a remote server for my info. It also takes some time and patience to download the entire blockchain so just fire it up and forget about it until it finishes.
But once you have the blockchain downloaded (5+ gigs at this point?), you can copy the blockchain to other machines running the client so you don't have to wait to download the entire blockchain again.

Goldbugs are threatened by Bitcoin because they know we, Bitcoin holders, will be able to effortlessly buy and sell the metals market in a year or two. The old libertarian guard has been invested in PMs for years and Bitcoin throws their gameplan off. They'll either adapt and thrive or they won't.
Excellent essay, btw. You defended well.

Regulate it here, another country would welcome it as an unregulated currency. People would dump their dollars for whatever currency got them bitcoins. Good for Bitcoin and other currencies, bad for the dollar.

You could send from exchanges but...
You never, ever want to store your bitcoins on someone else's wallet. Personally, I don't trust any of the exchanges and would never send them a satoshi but not everyone shares my level of distrust.
Use a local wallet for spending and a paper wallet for storing. Bitcoin-qt is my go to client for a local wallet but it takes a day or two to download the blockchain.

You asked for a valid reason for the existence of Litecoin. It exists because LTC users see value in it. The arguments you're using against LTC are the same arguments fiat believers use against Bitcoin. 
Currencies can and should exist because the users want them or have a need for them.

I want the US government to make Bitcoin illegal. It would hasten the government's demise while making Bitcoin more valuable.
The supposition that Bitcoin would wither up and die if the Feds said no-no to Bitcoin via law doesn't take into account the fact that other countries might embrace Bitcoin as a result.

120 confirmations is 120 blocks, roughly 12 hours of network time. The orphan chain tonight was about 20 blocks long so every miner that got 25 btc in those orphan blocks lost them because they didn't make it into the main blockchain after resequencing.

Correct. But you need to get online at some point to transfer the coins to the new public address. Only the public address is ever exposed to the network, never the private keys.
