I just tried -zapwallettxes and it did not work. The transaction is still there. It has now been stuck for 4 days.

Will do thanks for the help.

So just confirming I did the command right, I opened up a command prompt in windows  then entered 
"D:\BitCoin&gt;bitcoin-qt.exe -zapwallettxes"
Bitcoin Core launched up and is slowly Rescanning.
Thanks again for all your help

Are my bitcoins gone forever, I have literally tried every single option out there and they have not been returned to my wallet. If they never get picked up by a minor how will i ever get them back?
The default fee that bitcoin core puts on the coins is stupid, I have never had a problem with it before.

Ok thanks I got my id accepted with the accelerator. Now do I just wait now?

Didn't work. The unconfirmed transaction is still there

I have been trying that for the last couple days and I always get the same message 
Submissions are beyond limit. Please try later.

But how can I increase the transaction fee? The coins have been removed from my account and are unconfirmed and I don't want to lose them in limbo

The Viabtc accelerator still requires the minimum fee to have been paid on the transaction. What did you pay for your fee?
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:02:57
So once I use that code will the unconfirmed coins be returned to my wallet or is there another step?
Thanks for your help

Ok thanks I am trying the zapwallettxes command now
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:43:46
I don't want to try double spending as I don't have enough coins in my wallet after the stuck transaction and I don't want both transactions to go through and loose twise the amount of coins.

How do you enable replace by fee?
I have already done the -rescan command as well as the abandon transaction command but it still keeps popping up
