Alternative: There's a dollar bill dispenser placed atop each stripper's pole. Each time you send the equivalent of $1 in BTC, a bill is dispensed and floats down to the ground. Send $20 (or 0.03127 BTC) and it will rain down twenty $1 bills.

They changed their policy since yesterday. Now, in order to use the promo code, your email address has to have been subscribed to their newsletter for 24 hours or more. Yesterday no login was required to apply the promo code. Today, there is a message on the page stating *"Promo codes have usage limitations that require you to enter your email address to enable Promo Codes."*. Once you enter your email and the code, it will give the error message and remove the 'bitcoindeal' code.
I found this out by chatting with a representative. She told me about the stipulation '*you have to be subscribed  to our newsletter for 24 hours before using that promo code*' and gave me a link to subscribe (which didn't work because it had an extra '.' at the end). But I informed her of that and subscribed to their emails anyway, since I still have 34 hours before the sale ends...i think. I let ya'll know if they actually take my money or not.
Pretty lame Newegg...you've changed, man.
**edit**: *In case it seems like I'm attempting to use the code twice, I'm not. I tested it yesterday without paying. Today, the page is different and I can't place my order. I haven't bought anything yet, but I'm trying to.*
**2nd Edit, 3:03pm 8/31**: *Cleared my web cache, history, cookies and checked out as a guest...and it worked! Email address didn't matter with this method. But if I log-in to my actual newegg account, it removes the promo code. weird.*

Well, I agree that OP's post in personalfinance should have been removed for being the 100th 'windfall' post this week. Just because it said 'bitcoin' instead of 'inheritance' or 'lotto winnings' doesn't make it discrimination. It's what they do with posts that ask "where do I put all this new money?". They refer you to the sidebar. It is like someone posting in here asking if they should buy bitcoin, or where to get it.

I gave my mom a paper wallet for half a bitcoin when it was valued at $109 per BTC. So like, a $55 gift. And apparently she talked shit about it later to everyone and made fun of me. Now it's worth $600 and since I kept the private keys as well as the public one, I can see that she's never spent any of it. She probably lost the paper wallet. But someday I'll ask her what happened to it and just shrug, then go home and take that shit back by moving it my phone or something. Or maybe one day it will get spent. Eh...that's my random lil story.

send yourself an email where every 13th word is a word from your wallet seed. in case of emergency, refer to that email and you've got your seed hidden in plain site. someone would have to have access to your email, know about that particular archived email, know which words to pick out for the seed, and then know where to use it. I find that unlikely.

isn't there a guy around here named 'davebitcoin' or something like that who has cracked people's wallets for a fee? maybe you can search for him? (I'm not joking...there are some old posts about him but I'm to lazy to look it up.) But I think the people had partial passwords or txt files like you and he got the wallets open and was legit about things. Or maybe I'm living in lala land and he was outed as Mark Karpeles...but look into it. good luck.

I don't think the price dropped a bunch the other day BEFORE the ETF was rejected. People react to news by buying and selling. Only if you're getting slow news or not keeping up with events do those dips happen before the news gets out. Usually people hear the FUD and react. I agree with you though, that Crypto 'experts' and journalists try to put market movements into a context that doesn't apply.
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:27:25
Not really. They talk a lot about taxes and investing in there too. Just because they don't like bitcoin talk doesn't mean they're exclusively focused on getting 'out of poverty'. That's just a weak, underhanded insult. So they don't want bitcoin posts during a bitcoin boom...they probably see a lot of shit posts around this time.

I think you can look at this situation in two ways...Here's an example: 
I bought a $100 Amazon gift card (from Gyft) using Bitcoin. That was 2 days ago. Now when I look in my bitcoin wallet I see:
1. The transaction for the $100 gyft card, in USD, is now $106.92. (so this illustrates OP's point.)
2. The appreciation of bitcoin's value over the last 48 hours has caused my balance to grow to more than it was when I purchased the gyft card. So, if we're looking at everything in US dollars...it kinda looks like a free $100 gift card.
If I spent the $100 cash, I could not have bought bitcoin with that money. Also, I got some rewards points from gyft...it's a fun, win-win experience using bitcoin.

Thanks for the heads up and I'm sorry that you lost your coins. I'm curious though...did you have a keypad lock or passcode that was bypassed? Or did the attacker get physical access to your phone when it was already unlocked or something? Good luck man.

I want Gyft to be worth using, but so far I've been screwed out of $100 with it so I'm not impressed. I bought a gift card to Barnes and Noble, so I could buy Xmas gifts with bitcoin. At the register, the app kept giving me errors instead of displaying the barcode and card number. (I had internet connection but The error said:'This order is still processing. Check back later.' even though I'd bought the giftcard at home on my computer hours earlier and was already charged.) So after a few minutes trying to get it working, and holding up the line, I ended up just paying for the merchandise with a debit card. I get home and look and boom...there's the card number on my screen. I contact support to tell them the app kinda screwed me out of $100 and they just suggest I regift it to someone, since the card number has been exposed. No refunds. Lame.
So I ended up spending $200 at Barnes and Noble on xmas gifts instead of a few mBTC. Also, I was trying to teach my wife a little about bitcoin and this set us back a bit. I basically made it look like a big pain in the ass. 
I have other Gyft cards I haven't used yet, but I think I now have to print them at home and carry the printouts with me since no one can scan my phone anyway and the app might not work. Wish me luck this weekend...I'm trying to travel with bitcoin and Gyft is part of that. I'm scared it will all go horribly wrong, and I'll have hundreds of 'Hyatt-bucks' I can't spend at the fucking Hyatt.

Maybe I'm too suspicious/skeptical/cynical...whatever...but I still haven't seen a way to make a paper wallet without putting my trust in a website that may be able to rip me off. I have coins in coinbase but want to move them to cold storage, but everything I see like bitaddress.org,bitcoinpaperwallet.com,electrum,armory,etc...they all require that you trust them to some degree that they won't rob all their clients at a future date.
I'm not saying it's likely, but it is possible. So my question is: How can I get an address and private key for a paper wallet or USB wallet that doesn't require me to trust anyone? 
(Sounds like I have trust issues, ha.) ^^^^^[I ^^^^^do]

So I just asked myself when I'd consider a satoshi (.00000001 of a bitcoin) important or worth spending and my first thought was, "When it's worth a penny in USD, I guess"
Then I realized that would mean each bitcoin is worth a million USD. Ha. I guess we need smaller denominations than a penny. But even still, if a satoshi is worth a hundredth of a penny, that means a bitcoin is worth $100 thousand. It was nice to think about, anyway.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:51:26

currently waiting on a transfer into my dwolla account. was taking a while so I thought I'd grab a few coins using the WalMart method while I'm waiting. 
I feel like bitcoin will really appreciate in value once getting them isn't such a pain in the ass. Having a few hundred dollars tied up in questionable interweb transactions isn't something most people have the stomach for.
