Changed, is that better?

Seriously people? Downvotes because he uses a disliked mining pool?

Have a Radeon HD 4670 doing 28MH/s according to BTC Guild.
@_date: 2011-07-07 03:14:49
I'd buy it. @_date: 2011-08-28 05:58:00
You wouldn't happen to be related to the project, would you? Considering this [isn't your first semi-promotional post about a Bitcoin knockoff](
NINJA EDIT: Oh wait, you are related! [You're being paid to spam this post.](

*makes joke about how reddit takes 10x that to load*

If you're looking for an easy solution, I'd look at  - haven't used it myself though.
For maximum compatibility along with having everything self-hosted, I'd go with what riplin said.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:49:44
Oh, okay. Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2011-06-01 03:12:28
I'd love to try it out! If you get enough interest, check out [TestFlight](

Same here - any newbies are now restricted to their own little subforum. I've also seen several posts critical of this move being deleted.
@_date: 2011-06-20 18:08:07
Yep! As of writing, the current block number is 132117 (from [here]( Once it reaches that it *should* show up.
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:53:49
Yeah - many aren't even salted.
@_date: 2011-06-07 19:29:13
Awesome, looks great!
Just sent 1BTC plus change.
@_date: 2011-06-14 08:34:11
I thought you meant "R Language" as in lots of cursing.
Time for me to go to sleep.
@_date: 2011-07-12 05:44:10
Yes, I know - it's the first time I've rethemed a subreddit and the CSS they've coded is not exactly the best for restyling.
Taking it down for a day, it should look better when it's back up.
@_date: 2011-05-27 02:18:53
Love the idea! Also, nice use of Hype.
@_date: 2011-06-03 05:08:48
for more levelheaded discussion about the article.
@_date: 2011-07-09 17:22:49
True... worth it.
@_date: 2011-07-12 16:25:09
Yeah, Rework is awesome. One of the best pieces of advice I've seen on the forum.
@_date: 2011-05-20 22:49:33
This is originally a [TechCrunch post]( - Washington Post reposts some articles from there.
@_date: 2011-07-13 01:31:56
Yes - I only do the CSS, no moderation. And yes, I know the recent attempt didn't look that good. It's being worked on to be way more subtle.
@_date: 2011-06-20 17:50:06
1) It takes some time for the block chain to download. Most likely they are running late or the block hasn't updated yet.
2) To create the symlink, open up Terminal (found in /Applications/Utilities), then type the command listed:
    ln -s /Volumes/Bitcoin ~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin
@_date: 2011-06-15 12:28:41
If you're on Mac, cd into the MacOS directory housing the UNIX executable file, then:
    ./Google\ Chrome --app=
If that doesn't work, cd into your /Applications directory and:
    open -a Google\ Chrome.app --args "--app=

Could you draw the reddit alien sitting on top a pile of bitcoins? I can send you 1BTC!

From a post of his on the forums.

Just got that email too, probably from the Mt. Gox fiasco. Sent back a - not so kindly worded reply.
@_date: 2011-06-11 06:11:37
I switch between [mtgoxlive.com]( and [coin.ly](

Great app, though retina assets would be nice! &lt;/ocd&gt;

EDIT: Oh, [this article]( Usual stupidity.
@_date: 2011-05-31 00:22:30
That's just sad. [Nothing's even been done with that address.](

Per month.

I could be wrong; that's just what I'm hearing on  and 
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:48:48
Think you have the wrong subreddit.
@_date: 2011-07-12 16:22:21
I just do the CSS :P
@_date: 2011-07-07 14:49:27
Will do later today (in the process of moving computers)!
@_date: 2011-06-19 19:33:05
Luckily it's bcrypt+sha256+md5, but better safe than sorry.
EDIT: I'm wrong, see below.
@_date: 2011-07-12 05:42:08
This is the first time I've rethemed a subreddit, so sorry for the awful colors.
I'm taking it down for a day while I make it a little less vomit-inducing.
@_date: 2011-06-09 17:58:33
I'm getting 15 Mhash/s here on a Radeon HD 4670.
@_date: 2011-06-11 11:23:34
Anything in the Bay Area and I am SO there.
@_date: 2011-07-13 01:32:38
Thanks for your helpful feedback - it's being reworked to be much more subtle.
@_date: 2011-06-08 23:54:09
True, but I think your link is better suited for or @_date: 2013-05-29 04:28:00
Thomas was Alone has one of the most engaging and well-written stories of any game I've played recently, and the voiceover/audio design is amazing. Gameplay-wise, it's a pretty nice puzzle platformer. Nothing groundbreaking there.
