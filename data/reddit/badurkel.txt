how do we determine the fair market value of fiat? we can't. assets gold and natural gas don't matter, like in zimbabwe and venezuela. only trust keeps it together. bitcoin will hold as long as people have trust in it. and i really don't see that trust going anywhere. it hasn'ty even seen major swings tbh, compared to the alts below ltc

how? first selling with sell walls and tiny amounts so the system jams and then unloading a bunch in intervals, causing continous deterioration in confidence and panic due to sell walls (literally what happened on jan 18, all of this). Then just long for the settlement time and buy more before the threshold, it's easy to buy more and raise the price if you're a market maker. Even the biggest exchanges are not operating at volumes of one trades by the top whales of btc. its sfae to say if 70000 btc get a buyer that price is shooting up no matter what happens in this world. 
PLUS you're getting btc at a sale which will upward correct at some point, so that profit is factored in here too. 
How do you have 5 upvotes thats what an 8 year old will do if you tell him what futures is you know. there are a lot lot of other ways to approach this too, and ways wall street will be using you and i wouldnt even know of. derivatives markets have a lots of instruments. you can just short and long btc without futures also.

literally never met anyone who had such a categorical problem with moms. not their mom, there are plenty of those, but the  whole concept of mom

its not that easy to continue doing this. bear traps rely on low confidence. keep doing that to a community whose top whales are early adopting nerds and soon it will stop working. its not working right now either. i see many verticals spikes and dips throughout the day but market always brings it back up. more confidence, even i n a 500b tiny market, will effectively thwart this manipulation more than marketcap or adoption ever will. just stop selling or buying on these 90 degree 40b in and out spikes come on.

well the transition from salt to fiat happened pretty quick, so i have hopes this can still come true.

lol "so youre telling me usa is not the best country? Thats ridiculous to suggest id require proof"
USD is the most restricted currency when it comes to crypto trading, im surprised it is even 19.8. so many americans legit think adding coins to coinbase makes them moon, they're so parched for usd/crypto pairing they think the whole world is too, so how the hell is it 1/5 of the entire world? thats crazy high

yup though countered by the new money thats coming in. the deficit in price due to lack of adoption and the inflation rate would cancel each other out, overwhelmingly so too i would believe.

man how hilarious are you

yup. Japan is also going through its worst phase of unemployment, thats the tragic reason they crazy about bitcoin. not because they're more comfortable throwing away their money as they have so much of it as this idiot suggested. these moonlambo kids still think whoever buys btc is for the same reason they got it, having no idea wtf we're even doing here.

they're not more tech savvy, rather they dont have the same hangups about adapting to change. its only in the west that ideas like books have a certain smell and feel to it and guitars should remain acoustic or whatever kinda antiquated and ridiculously primitive ideas exist. to slow to adapt. 
even if all people everywhere are equally prone to taking up new tech, the east just doesn't have those hangups, hence you'll see much more technology on the streets and in their culture than diy guys playing music with their staplers and utensils or book clubs or some shit

hes silent, obviously. "this guy got paid 10000 btc for 2 pizzas in 2010; get him!" is not much of a headline
