Yes, it can be analyzed in a quantifiable, probabilistic way, but that doesn't mean jack shit because we don't know enough about Satoshi Nakamoto. The only evidence provided in this article is an out of context quote and a bunch of circumstantial evidence. Probabilistic analysis can basically only quantify the circumstantial evidence, which may make it seem more convincing, but it doesn't really make it stronger.


Or they choose a pseudonym that was based on someone they knew or heard about from work (or any number of places), which could definitely be this guy. Satoshi might have worked with him on something, or even just seen his name and thought it was cool.


Those assumptions don't have to hold for someone to create bitcoin. Satoshi might have been working on bitcoin in his spare time while he worked on something else, giving him an alibi. Satoshi might not have as much as a formal education as it seems - he might be self-taught, or he might have a degree in something completely unrelated. What you have listed are things that Dorian has that make it seem like he created bitcoin. It is probably true that not very many other people have those things, but it doesn't matter because Satoshi Nakamoto doesn't necessarily have those things. Besides, the probabilistic analysis you do on a individual is nearly useless if Satoshi Nakamoto is multiple people, which still seems like a strong possibility.
TL;DR: In order for an analysis like this to be useful, you need to know what you're looking for, and we don't really know enough about Satoshi Nakamoto know what we're looking for.

He must be pretty badass to make a game out of his worst nightmare.

What about a rise in transaction volume?

Not enough schemes and flakes got cleansed, obviously.

If they didn't change the conversion, 1 chip = .001 btc, so it's .00745
