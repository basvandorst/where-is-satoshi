That sucks! Can't recommend to remove the other two for now. They need visibility more than price bs

I do not keep track of volume in dollar amount so I cannot compare coinmarketcap data. I keep good track of volume on major exchanges. Just posting what I have been seeing, I am sure others who spend as much time as I do on this have also noticed.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:21:33
Low volume isnt necessarily a red flag but I've been in this for a long time and I can understand low volume during holidays but even now its as low as Christmas day or New years eve
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:20:49
You obviously know more than me. Keep looking at the charts
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:23:34
But I like this sub and want to stay here :(
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:36:57
Let's discuss here lol
When is it hitting a billion?
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:22:13
That still does not explain the low volume because majority uses bitcoin to buy into alts!
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:21:39
No reason to say good bye to anything other than fiat!
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:20:17
That is honestly hard to believe. Newbies who only got in for the money and do not even understand the tech cannot possibly hold during a quick market correction like this, especially if they have no prior investing experience in other markets. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:53:03
Fuck! looks like I jinxed it lol
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:57:21
I don't know how they are collecting their data but I have an account at every major exchange and every single one of them has had low volume, like 40% less than normal day (not including holidays or major move days)
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:46:40
Where did you get million coins in 24 hours? I am only counting the exchange/trading volume 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:56:12
I'll be happy if it just closes above $15k today
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:47:29
I'm pretty sure I have seen more than 2
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:37:18
Compare the coins to past. Dollar amount is irrelevant
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:39:13
I mean we HAVE to HAVE a place to talk about the price. If it's against the rules to create new posts, they should sticky one daily. Even a master/weekly sticky will work I guess sorting by new posts if it's too much work for the mods to create a new one everyday

I don't think organizations like these are going to hold bitcoins as an investment or even speculation. Most certainly they are going to convert it to fiat to cover some of their expenses. 
Still a good thing that they are atleast open to the idea of accepting it as a form of payment and not dismissing it completely as some scam like my church who laughed at my idea of allowing bitcoin donations. 
As many users we can get, hopefully they will use it to cover their expenses directly with bitcoin in the future and not change it to fiat.

Bad idea my man

Drop me a note if anyone is interested in doing AMA with their management team. They are all volunteers but I asked them if they would be interested in doing an AMA on reddit and they are excited about having the change to further their mission. I will see if I can arrange an AMA and then whoever sent me a message, I will send them a link when AMA is live.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:14:23
Send me a private message or comment here if you would like to participate in an AMA session with the volunteer team. I am arranging something for this weekend and I can share the link of AMA when it goes live to whoever is interested in participating or even just learning more about their mission.
Peta.org has been attacking them with a huge ad campaign promoting euthanasia.

Also, instead of spending all your time refreshing charts, consider volunteering with them. They can use all the help they can get and they have remote volunteering opportunities!
Spread the word about volunteering too please. Whole organization runs on volunteers and they work with thousands of small sanctuaries and shelters so there is always need for more volunteers. 
Thanks for all the support and upvotes. You guys are a generous group of people.

NoKill Network works with thousands of pet shelters across USA, Canada, UK and Australia. The organization is non profit and is run entirely by volunteers.
They help promote small shelters and sanctuaries that have pledged to never kill an animal. Millions of pets are put down by big shelters and their owners across the world when they are unable to find someone to adopt them. 
NoKillNetwork.org is the only such organization. I have been donating and volunteering with them for more than 7 years now. I convinced them to accept Bitcoin as anonymous donation method and one of their volunteer developer just sent me an email letting me know they have added Bitcoin as donation method. To donate you can visit their donation page here  they have a button for Bitcoin donations on the left side. It allows you to send donations anonymously. I am donating 0.01 (all I can afford right now) and will make all future donations via bitcoin. I also encourage that you volunteer with them, they will connect you with a local nokill shelter or you can volunteer with them remotely if you have any technical or marketing skills. Submit the volunteer application and they will let you know how you can help.
Another good organization that is helping these small shelters and sanctuaries is Rescue Groups at rescuegroups.com. They do not accept Bitcoin yet but they confirmed they will implement that soon. If you are willing to donate using other methods, please check out Rescue Groups organization too.
Please upvote for visibility if you care about animals or believe in their mission. Thanks

I hope it does but if you watch his interviews on cnbc that guy has mastered the art of talking out of his ass

Upvote if you believe Bitcoin utility will be just store of value and not really a currency. I understand that was not the original intention but why does everyone seem to think pivoting is a problem. 
If Bitcoin replaces Gold and is never able to replace USD. Why is that a bad thing? Why is everyone complaining so much about the fees? Who wants to even use such an asset for normal day to day purchases? 
I do not want to get rid of my coins for fucking coffee!!
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:58:24
I honestly do not see an issue. I think Bitcoin has already crossed the point where it will actually take the place of a currency, some other altcoin may take that role. Bitcoin for me and for many others will just be a store of value and to move larger amounts of money hassle free. Few dollars to transfer millions? There will always be demand for that.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:13:15
I am not saying it HAS to replace Gold. Obviously if it can never replace Gold, it will for sure never replace Fiat. 
I am just confused why everyone keeps complaining about the transaction delays when they are being too cheap on fees. Like who is really buying coffee or day to day items with bitcoins now? Early adopters did us a favor but it's stupid to spend coins when the value has not yet stabilized. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:12:19
I appreciate the intent to help but dude you are in wrong subreddit!!!

I would be scared if I started seeing $17.01 price.
