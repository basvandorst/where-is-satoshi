That was really my intention... You clearly got the point 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:40:33
I really wasn't asking for advise... Just giving my unsolicited one 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:32:43
Well... The wait paid off after all 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:43:58
Also, that's why I said mine was unsolicited...

This Happens when you don't speak only your country language 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:44:36
You got it

I'm surprised too... But I'm also confident that the correctional dip will come eventually (and the latter the bigger it will be)

Really? Please form a sentence in portuguese to demonstrate it

The problem here is I do not have a amount to invest that would justify the price of a trezor (with shipping and taxes to Brazil the price would be up to 300 euros)
Buying in the exchange and selling I'm the exchange would also tax me on around 15%...

Well, my exchanger is on basically the same price all day... Maybe because the exchange rate changes to keep the price stable. I'm from Brazil BTW 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:48:50
In your opinion, should I expect a new dip or I'm better of buying now? I don't need sell it anytime soon, so it's just to increase the inevitable profit... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:39:58
Will do... But since I still need some company that needs to be under Brazilian laws to buy or sell BC I'm also still under the umbrella of the Brazilian taxes...
