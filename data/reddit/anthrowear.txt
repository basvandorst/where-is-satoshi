[AnthroWear Feral Apparel]( accepts bitcoin, and we hold it. We hand-make a variety animal costume apparel and accessories for furries and those who are furry at heart. I agree, immediately converting to fiat would defeat the purpose of using bitcoin in the first place. We're  trying to support the bitcoin community, not use it.

Surely you must mean the US?

See about adding LTC/USD as well as LTC/BTC.
If you guys aren't watching the rate of LTC top BTC and trading them back and forth with the fluctuations, you are losing out on a lot of potential profit. I actually suggest doing this over just buying and selling BTC or LTC for USD, for two main reasons:
1) It's a little less risky than trading crypto to fiat.
2) The idea is to keep your money in cryptocurrency in order to keep its value constantly rising. If people are only using it to buy and sell when the market looks good/bad, then the price will never stabilize. The system needs long term holders in cryptocurrencies to keep it rising steadily. It doesn't matter so much  whether your money is in LTC or BTC, they both benefit the system. Selling off your coins for dollars is what hurts it.
I have been doing this maybe a few times a day as the rate fluctuates, and am seeing a profit of about 2% to 10% per day. So starting with 10 LTC, its not hard to make 1 LTC per day. Could be more depending on the day and how actively you are trading.
Also, great work on the table so far! Thanks for doing this :)
