The fees are pretty high on Square Cash by means of an inflated rate. The are a broker-dealer more than an exchange.

It's also "Igg**y**". I should have reposted the corrected typo; oh well.

Sorry to hear it. There were a couple cash in mail trades where the cash never came as well. It's strange.

If you don't mind me asking, how long ago was this and how did he jack you?
You aren't the first person, despite his many legit trades.

Sometimes he DJs at clubs. House and electro.

I used to write payment gateways for eCommerce sites (providing APIs for authorizing and capturing credit card and debit card payments), and wow was it tedious work. It was crazy how archane it was interacting with these financial networks. It was crazy to me how easy it was to interact directly with the currency's settlement layer when Bitcoin came out, and I could effectively bid on what the settlement fee would be. This blew my mind before I even got to the cryptography that allowed it to be trustless and decentralized.

Have you seen their website? Call it what you will, they are not the "standard pool".

In the USA, trading a sculpture for a painting is very much a taxable event if a value can be assigned to either and it doesn't pass the like-kind exchange test. It's the same kind of barter sale that is realized if you sell Bitcoin for ethereum or if you trade a house for a boat. See IRS literature on capital gains tax for barter transactions.

If you're in The States, the futures are a better match for day traders if you expect to be profitable due to the 60/40 tax rule. They are a flat $15 per contract (each covering 5x the USD value of Bitcoin). Just need enough collateral to participate.

You can look at Activity Monitor. If you're CPU bound, Bitcoin Core should be taking up around 100% × CPU cores. Yes, CPU or disk is just going to slow you down getting there, but once synced, the box should be able to keep up just fine.

On a 2012 MBP, they're going to be either CPU-bound or disk I/O bound within an hour of connectivity.

This is the middle initial he used on search warrants back in his FBI days. Example:

I didn't see any indication it was an address, more that it was a an entire wallet. At least one or two addresses from that wallet would be nice info though.

Right now, the project has very few benefits over Magento and other e-commerce solutions.

Does bitcoinity actually have volume data? Only published API for that is the trades list, which breaks for rollup calculations when there are more than 500 trades in a rollup period.
@_date: 2015-10-15 19:26:28
Yea, and that's where the 500 trades issue hits. You'd be able to get around this limit if they provided a cursor or pagination for that request, but they don't.
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:57:59
What API call is it that provides the volume data? They claim they don't have one yet.

It's my go-to spot. It has advantages over the exchanges:
* It's operated on a distributed system (IRC, Freenode)
* It's as anonymous as you want it to be.
* [The software that runs it is open source.](
* You can rely on the centralized services (web of trust, orderbook) or you don't have to.
* Orders don't directly affect the price on a major exchange.
* The ratings system is used as a datasource everywhere. e.g. localbitcoins, btcjam.

While the authentication and rating system can be used by web-based-exchanges, the channel itself has active trading. The trades aren't always as high as 20k BTC, but it does happen.
