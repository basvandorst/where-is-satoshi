You don't need to have each party have an equal amount of Bitcoin in a channel. Most use cases would probably be one sided channels because usually one person is the payer and one is the payee. 
If you don't have a channel between you and the person you want to pay you would either have to open a channel with them, open a channel with an entity you both can reach, or just make a non-lightning transaction.

Gemini charges 0.25% on both the maker and the taker sides of a trade, whereas coinbase only charges the taker. Love gemini other than that tho

You get a blockchain, you get a blockchain, and you get a blockchain!

I think the point is to give away a small amount, such that it would hardly be worth the time to go sell it. Instead, there's a new user who has downloaded a wallet, knows a little bit about Bitcoin, and might be able to tell someone else about it.

Love the idea, hate the name.

So, that could even be a strategy for getting your funds out of the channel early. Pretend to be offline, wait for them to close out the channel without you, and then take our funds. You don't gain any funds doing this, you just get your coins out faster. 
Of course, the concept of a payment channel is partly based on the fact that most of the time everything goes well and parties can agree to close the channel cooperatively.

This is probably a question better suited for bitcoin.stackexchange.com than for reddit...

This problem stems from someone being able to create a block with the coinbase + 1 giant transaction with tons of inputs. Each input may need to calculate the hash to sign at least once, but more if the transaction is created in a malicious way. For each sig-hash calculation, you have to hash the whole transaction, which is essentially the whole block, which equates to doing many many hashing operations just to verify the validity of a stupid malicious transaction. 


Not sure why you would think that, SegWit just moves the signatures out of the transaction, but the signatures are removed from the transaction anyway during signing. Technically SegWit makes the sighash problem even worse by giving a discount on the sighash data. 


Since this was on the assumption that SegWit somehow fixed the quadratic hashing issue, this is also not true, I believe.
