I moved to a credit union in my province over a year ago. Royal Bank had done one too many douche corporate profiteering moves for my liking.
I suggest Canadians who are interested in the long-term fortunes of BTC in Canada consider their local credit union. Empower the local community and stick it to the big banks.

Yup, that's the one. I went there a few weeks ago and had a chance to try  it out. It was extremely easy and intuitive (aside from the lack of English on the machine). The team from Coinplug was actually there, packing up for the day, when I showed up in the late afternoon, but they re-booted the ATM so that I could try it. Nice people and they gave me a good vibe :)

Me too. Virtex has offered me consistently great service and I have very little to complain about. They've responded to my help tickets quickly and courteously. The only thing that takes to long is the deposits. I've had to wait for over a week for money to go through. The bank clears the money as per usual, but Virtex seems to get backed up on the deposits.

This guy is a complete imbecile and obviously a sycophantic bootlicking shill who's only goal is to perpetuate an obsolete, decaying exploitative system. He's doing this--or at least he's trying to do this through honeyed words and fear. Master Card are going to be irrelevant in a few years. Who knows how long, but it's inevitable that trustless, decentralized, open-source, ethically designed crypotcurrencies triumph.  This corporate rant is purely reactionary. I agree with previous posts: it's purely a fear based reaction. If it wasn't, MasterCard wouldn't bother to create a rebutal. Visa and Mastercard will go the way of Kodak. It's a beautiful inevitablity. They will fight and resist, but like so many other legacy technologies who can't forsee a world in which they don't exist, they will be replaced and improved upon. Humans will progress. This guy is a preposterous ass and I can barely tolerate his nonsense. What a tool.

I've been having the exact same problem.  Every time i input my pin number it gives me the "failed to decrypt" notice.  I only have $20 on the wallet,  but this is the exact reason why I was hesitant to add more: I worried the app might be untrustworthy. Anyone solve this on their own?

He won't allow innovation unless it's done to benefit the powers that be. He does the bidding of those above him; and if he doesn't, if he'll be replaced. Bitcoin will only be tolerated to the point that it benefits the elites. 
But thankfully bitcoin/crypto's promise is to replace and transcend these antiquated models (flawed models, incidentally, that are based on a world that's long gone). Why should we be thankful when these bankrupt, kleptocratic institutions give us a nod and promise us a shred of freedom. Bitcoin is to replace and re-invent. It's an evolution. History will prove this guy and his masters to be irrelevant.

Exactly. It's all the potential functionality that can be programmed into or onto the blockchain that I find so exciting. These crypto developments are an existential threat to the banks' "business as usual" model. The essence of what it means to be a bank--the various functions and services--is being re-configured. Banks that are nimble and understand the new paradigm will survice, albeit in a different form. Banks that don't get it, the slow ones, they'll eventually become irrelevant.

I went on a discovery mission to COEX mall in Seoul today, looking for Korea's first bitcoin ATM. After a bit of hunting around I finally found Sedona coffee shop and had the opportunity to give it a shot. Actually, the Coinplug team had already shut down the machine and were packing up for the day, but I just happened to get there before they left and when they realized I was there to try things out they happily re-booted the system and guided me the whole way through. On top of that, as a promotional gift they even sent  me enough btc to buy a coffee. Although the machine doesn't currently support English (they're adding it soon) the whole process was ridiculously intuitive and easy. One of the best things about the process was that no ID was necessary--nothing. On top of that, their team was super friendly, energetic and enthusuastic and I got a really good vibe from them. Currently they're testing the waters to see what user interest is like, but ultimately, if Koreans begin to embrace bitcoin, Coinplug have ambitions to expand throughout Asia--and not just atms; their main goal is to become Asia's Coinbase. 
Bitcoin in Korea seems a natural marriage. Seoul is tech-crazy and for most here the bitcoin learning curve would be negligible. It'll be interesting to see how the government reacts. From the sounds of it, Coinplug is hoping that Korea can play catch-up and eventually become a dominant player in the space. After using a bitcoin ATM today and then buying a coffee with BTC afterwards, it felt like the future had arrived. BTC is really is going global :) 
If you're in Seoul, I suggest heading to Sedona Coffee shop. Use your digital money to buy tasty physical things.

How is this news not relevant, at least indirectly? If true it suggests that offline computers can (potentially) be breached by the NSA. Bitcoin's security, and ultimately its success, is dependent on the security of the architecture it relies upon, is it not? Don't flaws or security weaknesses potentially pose an existential risk to the currency? 
I added the disclaimer because the article doesn't explicity mention bitcoin. That said, in my opinion the content of the article is relevant in a larger computing sense. I asked a question because I was hoping that people might be able to explain the content of the article away. Maybe the NSA revelation isn't anything to worry about. If so, I was hoping people would explain why.

I'm a teacher (Korea) and my kids are intrigued by crypto currency, especially the boys. They love its tech aspect, the speed, and especially the idea of "mining" digital wealth using their computers. I've already set up half the class with wallets (they wanted them) and I sent each a small fraction of bitcoin. That said, most of them are still confused by the whole thing. Many of them have trouble wrapping their minds around the fact that nobody owns bitcoin. I think maybe because they've been so conditioned to think that everything must be owned and run by corporations, they find it hard to believe that bitcoin isn't controlled and centralized, or that there isn't a massive marketing department behind it.

The current drop is mostly due to a massive liquidity squeeze in China. Record Chinese credit bubble is popping and people are sellign assets/investments to cover debts. Unfortunately, this will hurt everything from property prices around the world to the price of crypto.

I also tried a bitcoin ATM for the first time. But not in the US, I'm in Korea and I tried Coinplug's new install at a coffee shop. One of the things that struck me was how quick and painless it was. I'm Canadian and I know about the ID requirement of ATMs there, so the fact that the one here required nothing came as a shock...a nice shock though. It was as easy as saying how much I wanted, scanning a QR code, dropping two bills in a slot, then the BTC instantly showing up on my phone. And the guy told me I could cash out up to about $600/day too. No ID.
I'm not sure how long the Korean government will tolerate this kind of frictionless transfer in and out of fiat, but hopefully they maintain a hands off approach. The invasiveness in N. America is ridiculous and if government keeps applying layers of regulation and KYC, then BTC will suffer proportionately.
Right now Korea is setting itself up well. And maybe it can become a a leader in the space, with bitcoin ATMs that are as easy to use as regular bank ones.

I agree. While Cavirtex is by no means a perfect exchange, I have been quite pleased with their service over the last year. They've been fast and forthright in their dealings with me. Could they improve? Yes. But that goes for all exchanges. Given the fact that they were one of the first in Canada, it's understandable that it would take more time to re-direct the ship. Obviously VOS is a great exchange too, but I also agree that many Canadian exchanges and individual bitcoin traders have benefited from the pioneering legal/bureaucratic work that Cavirtex has accomplished. Cavirtex took risks and invested capital in a fast-moving, unregulated digital economy. Not easy, and I think people are often quick to attack and focus on the negatives. As I've said, I've been using Cavirtex for over a year now and I'm quite satisfied with the service. Most people who are happy with something don't take the time to write or say anything. I'm guessing that many other people have enjoyed--and personally benefited--from the service too. Again, do they need to act fast and quickly in a dynamic industry, and do they need to fix some things? Yes, definitely. They'll find themselves rendered obsolete very quickly if they refuse to listen to their customer base and genuinely change. 
And yes--fix your website! It's amateur hour.

I wonder if bitcoin transactions should ever be taxed at all. For example, if I convert $100 CAD into USD, then go on a trip to New York and while I'm there my US dollars appreciate in value compared to CAD, when I return to Canada the government doesn't ask me to pay taxes on the "profit" I've made from holding USD does it? Wouldn't the same also apply to BTC? That is, if BTC is in fact deemed to be currency/money.  
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:50:54
It's a moments like this, with negative news, that we'll discover whether BTC is anti-fragile or not. If it is, we cannot lose; it'll only gain strength and traction through adversity. And if it isn't robust enough to weather the shocks, then it deserves to fail. I believe digital currencies are hear to say; the paradigm shift is underway and it's not being rolled back (not unless the entire internet is shutdown). The majority of human beings, when they understand what digital currency is about, what it means, how it's ultimately empowering--they want this. It's almost self-evident. The BTC protocol takes money from being a top-down centralized system that's imposed on people and turns it sideways, and decentralizes and democratizes wealth. It's one of those things where I think it's fitting to say "it's time is now." Looking back in retrospect people in the future will see this time, what we're living through, as a watershed moment; something that ultimately transformed the nature of money and wealth. Bitcoin is kind of like a new post-WWII Bretton-Woods arrangement: whereas back then the USD became the international finance reference point, now, digital currency is replacing that system (but this time it won't be governments deciding). The ride won't be smooth but ultimately it's upward and outward and horizontal, until the digital currencies are ubiquitous. Digital currency will replace the tired, bankrupt 18th century constructs that we're all still laboring under.

I just think more Cyprus-like scenarios are going to play out, and when they do any capital that isn't tied down will flee. I think you're right about liquidity drying up in the US if tapering does in fact happen. The average person, locked into a collapsing economy and with no disposable income, probably won't be able to move much money into cryptos. But institutional money and the wealthy, aside from looking for traditional outlets like gold (and maybe treasuries?), will also flock to cryptos. I'm not sure I want this to happen or not. Tapering will not be pretty. The domino effect will be global.

I'm guessing huge amounts of capital locked up in the traditional investment ecosystem will seek a safe haven. Bitcoin and Litecoin will necessarily absorb lots of that capital. Easy to move money in and out, however, I think there would be a huge bottleneck because the BTC/LTC market isn't deep enough to absorb huge amounts of institutional capital. This would result in massive appreciation in both of their values. $$$ would be knocking on the door.

Right, redundancy is what makes systems "anti-fragile" in the words of Nassim Taleb. Redundancy essentially creates resilliency. One network is more prone to a random black swan event than two networks. This is why I think having several successful, liquid, widely-adoped digital currencies is a good thing. We should emulate the variegated structure of nature, not seek centralized, uniform systems. These are destined to fail in the long run in my opinion.

I agree, speed is essential. Getting involved sooner rather than later is likely crucial because things are moving so fast and one runs the risk of missing out on significant gains. It's like the Wild West now.
