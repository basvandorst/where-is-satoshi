1 cent is to high in my opinion if you want this to work as an alternative to 'money' - but again if its purpose isn't 'money' but 'gold' then there's no issue.
It's just not what i hoped for BTC when i heard about it years ago, though back then I assumed it would scale without issues, there wasn't thinking that we'd reach the limit and not just make the limit bigger. 
Though I guess there wasn't much discussion about that back then.

Yeah - I agree but I guess I understand why there is distrust and why things have stalled for so long.

From my reading between bitcoin forums on reddit - I would suggest you ask people who are against Segwit, I would link to a few articles about it but I'm aware that it could lead to my comments deleted here or face being banned.
I've been playing catch-up for the past few months on this coming back into Bitcoin and am yet to form an opinion - But both sides seem to be very aggressive towards one another which makes it difficult to work out what is BS.
From my understanding Segwit doesn't really allow BTC to scale? but I guess it depends on your definition of to scale - I've heard that it might relieve things for a while,a stopgap if you will but then a HF would be needed anyway.
I've been concerned about fee's being such a big thing these days, but then I always thought of BTC as the 'money' of the future - high fees on tx make this impossible - Others see it as the 'Gold' of the future - which means tx fees aren't really a problem.
Then there's all this talk of taking things off the main chain to do transactions - but I don't understand really why things need to go off the main chain.
But again - I'm confused still so take what I say with a grain of salt, I'd suggest looking in forums with people that are Anti-Segwit rather than in the Forum that is very Pro-Segwit, there are people much more versed on it than myself.

I guess i'm yet to understand why? the limit is artificial, What does it matter if it gets larger?

Here's a video that explains [Segwit]( - 4:20ish for info on risks with Segwit

Now they are saying? It's always been this way?

Ugh, feels like your merging two different ideas. Fees should be as low as possible for everyone to use Bitcoin as peer to peer cash. Investing is exactly that, there's always a cost to investment? Or I'm confused as to what your trying to say

No he didn't. Can you point to where he says this?

Lol, you sound like a child having a temper tantrum. I'm sick of this, lets burn it to the ground if I don't get my way!

That's not exactly what i'm seeing over there - A bunch of people have diversified to hold some ETH - Doesn't mean they don't care about bitcoin - It's pretty obvious a lot of people on both sides care about bitcoin.

Lol!!!
