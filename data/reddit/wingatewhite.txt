If it's a flat 3% then I'm fairly certain it's illegal. Even if he's taking the CC fee out, the fees vary all over so you having that exact rate is what sounds way off about it.

I think it will be fine as long as you are clear and up front about returns being in USD. As for BTC not being a currency, your statement is wrong. It is not a currency yet. In the long run it can be once it has stabilized a bit more. Right now it is far too volatile, as you have identified, to be treated as such.

I still don't fully understand the annual fees, transaction fees, and account maintenance stuff. I use my bank for everything and dislike using cash but I don't think I've ever paid a fee to my bank in any way except for stock transaction commissions. If your bank charges then surely there's another nearby that doesn't charge them, right?
Or are there really that few out there that suit basic consumers?

One of the obvious things is the fundamental difference in the incentive structure for how to allocate funds. In today's capitalist society we are all aware of inflation and pretty much agree thats why we put our money in the bank or in some form of investment to at least combat that purchasing power corrosion. In the system for Bitcoin there are a finite number of coins so it is inherently deflationary. The currency will become more valuable over time which would encourage people to hold onto their currency rather than lend it for a safe return. This is a pretty fundamental difference in how an economy should allocate risk which is why I could see a great number of economists disagreeing with Bitcoin as we know it.
