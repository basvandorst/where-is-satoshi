It was until recently I guess. Still isn't under their seller protection though.

That's exactly what I did? How does feedback not matter?

Some people prefer PayPal or eBay for some reason I don't know why.

I agree. While I understand why they value the buyer more than the buyer, they're known for their individual sellers who list things like antiques and collectibles. They're new policies are drifting them further and further from their roots.

The issue I see with dealing person to person is that you need to work out a time in which they can do it.  I'd prefer it be on my time, but that's just me. ATM's aren't the issue in my opinion, it's that there currently aren't many of them and the fees are too high. 
Bitcoin to USD is no different than USD to any other currency and should be treated as such with similar fees. As of now I understand the high fees. It's a growing industry with a small amount of customers.

Good point, the machine was Genesiscoin. I haven't used any others, but I imagine the process is the same or very similar so the issues I mentioned are still valid. The biggest being the confirmation time. Most people who go to ATM's don't have the time or the patience to wait ten minutes or longer for the transaction to confirm.

My ATM experience is different than yours then, probably because my bank has a shitty ATM that doesn't have a good touch screen. 
Regardless of that though, the point I was trying to make is that the whole process should take no longer than 5 minutes.

As I've told others who said this my fiat ATM experience must be different than yours. My bank has a shitty touchscreen which contributes to the slowness. The point I was trying to make though is that it shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes.

I wasn't clear. I meant that I assume the process of actually selling the bitcoins at other ATM's is similar. Meaning providing some kind of ID (in this case my phone number), selecting the USD amount, and sending the BTC. They told me there was an issue with the memory pool of their node (not 100% sure what this is) which caused it to back up my transaction.
My ATM experiences must be different from yours then since it takes me up to 5 minutes to withdraw cash. As for the ATM to BTM comparison, is the goal of bitcoin not to go mainstream? Meaning that the average ATM user (i.e. nearly every person I've ever met), would be the target audience for a bitcoin ATM. They would expect a similar experience to a fiat ATM if not an easier one. This is why I made the comparison. 
Thank you I've gotten my money back plus compensation from the company.

Not sure why you got downvoted, it was a valid question and you probably didn't have time to read through the comments.

To sell it didn't require ID, but did require at least your phone number. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 01:11:37
No problem. Other than this issue it was very easy. For the average person who knows nothing about BTC though it would be useful to explain transaction confirmations and give an estimated time.

In my email to the owner I asked what the issue was so hopefully they'll get back to me today and I can let you know the problem.
UPDATE: I was told they had an issue with the memory pool node

I agree with everything you said. The manufacturer/owner contacted me and made it up to me by paying a generous amount for my time/gas. They told me they hadn't experienced this issue before and that's why it took long to fix.
