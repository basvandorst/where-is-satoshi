If that whale is really NeoBee, than you should be happy, because there's something starting...
Don't you think, it's plaussible, that they were waiting for a time, once the price will stabilize, due to "Japan fiasco"?
"...price, price never changes..." this is not that case.
It will always go up and down, till there are whales...but, just imagine:
1.) There will be more whales, let's say as NeoBee. They will buy, they will guarantee the minimum price of BTC to their buyers and finaly give realy simple "know-how" to ordinary people.
2.) Why should those people still be afraid of start using btc as an ordinary fiat?
3.) Wualla
PS: I'm not pushing NeoBee..I just really like the system they're trying to achive.

Could it be Neobee? Making final steps, before launch?
It is time to buy shares?

Great idea...and why not.
If I got goxxed, I'll try to invest to some org or individuals willing to S&amp;D thieves

Sure that this is the case...take a look at it from a point:
1. No actions against Gox till end of the court investigation
2. Look, we've found Satoshi
3. High BTC move
Is he really thinking, that we are just a monkeys on a tree? Be sure an ugly, bad MojoJOJO is keeping an eye on them.
...and I'll be not surprised, if someone slash hit Mr. Frappuccino with hammer...I'm not talking about debugging
