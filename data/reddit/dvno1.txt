Thanks, this is amazing transparency. I can use your system without having to trust you.

I love you guys!

It's much worst, like Gox they keep most of it in a few private keys and have a database of how much they own each person. Total IOU system.

I'm in Sweden, sent you a message.

That really means nothing, if it's not public, assume it's a lie. Why can't they just make the bitcoin addresses of their cold storage wallets public? 
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:39:28
That was pretty funny.

I would love to make some $ for my node, but realistically, its too big for most people.

As I understand, if you create a multisig account, you can deposit any amount and there is no charge.
@_date: 2014-11-25 16:26:29
What a cheap move! ;)
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:39:55
This is interesting, but looks like the software will be crap
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:20:49
It's because Coinbase is a piece of shit. It fucking hosted on heroku!
@_date: 2014-08-06 14:45:47
Nice, got it :)

What happened to some of the most used wallets, Ledger, Coinkite, Circle, Trezor, Copay, etc...??
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:28:27
Bitcoin to the rescue!
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:19:45
This is really cool, I just tested here  
And I was able to redeem to my cold storage without making an account.

He's got the bug now. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:29:06
Looking forward to the next videos. 
Keep up the great work.

Nice I'm getting one of all hardware wallets this week. 
Does anyone know if Ledger S is also having a sale? 
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:21:49
When it comes to multi-sig, I've been very happy with Coinkite, lots of features.

Their message is invite a friend and get $5, should be invite a friend, buy/sell on our bad exchange rate and we will give $5 back.
