You can get decent battery life out of them, I average 2 hours when gaming. Even if you usually use it while plugged in, you'll really appreciate the times you need it without power. I didn't mind the last few power outages, caught up on GoT.  
  
Also, you could always buy spare batteries :)

I've used Vault of Satoshi without any issues.

I agree they're damn expensive, but I am happy with mine :)

Which is why I asked reddit for opinions on the whole thing.  
  
So far you're the only person to have commented and you're against.

Psst... Hey man, I got what you want... only 6.95%

Ideally, yes I'd like to know how much they're making. But in reality - I can't afford/don't want to fund multiple exchanges to make arbitrage trades. My coins would be sitting in my wallet, doing nothing. If they can offer me a percentage every day, I figure I might as well toss a a few days of mining into it, earn the on the amount banked for a few weeks, then pull my original amount out. Assuming I can get my 0.2 coins out, why would I care how much they're making?

bitcoin ATM to be showcased before Canadian Senate Committee? You better believe that's a dumping.

The KnC laws are beyond VoS - they have to implement them or they go under. Not saying I like them but you're blaming the wrong people.  
  
As far as the selfie backlash, I just don't get it. You've already uploaded a copy of your passport or drivers' licence - why the hell would you care about a selfie? Your ID has your photo, why would you care about putting another one beside it?  
The religious problems are a moot point since they (Islamic females) already show their faces for passport photos and at an airport to verify identity.   
He didn't own a camera? So visit a friend, or even go get a walmart photo done. I can guarantee he's in the very small minority of users who don't have a camera available.  
VoS is simply trying to prevent fraud with something that takes 30 seconds - I for one am glad they're being proactive about this. It's a shame people take issue with submitting a simple photo besides their PHOTO ID....

Ummm... you already provide a driver' license/passport - they simply ask you to take a picture of you holding the ID next to your face... you know, to ensure you're actually the person in the ID...  
Preventing fraud, what a terrible company...  /s  
- Please explain to me how this violates your privacy when you've already provided ID, proof of residence and/or proof of income?  
- I've already mentioned how this increases security  
- How the hell is this discrimination against the elderly/religious?  
VoS is the best exchange for Canadian users by far, these are security policies to prevent fraud. You're going off on a rant because they ask you to take a picture.... wow...

I assume their fees are collected from arbitrage. So let's say they made 8% profit in a day, they might keep 4% for themselves (I just made up those numbers).

I've been a big fan of these guys, used them for the game last year and will again this time

The response I got from a few co-workers was:  
Anything could be hacked/exploited, just because it's open-source doesn't make it secure. Heartbleed. But let's assume the bitcoin client is 100% without flaws, and none are ever inserted by a malicious dev team. Users are responsible for their own wallet security. This combined with no insurance/chargeback options is a huge concern for them.

You're not understanding his statement. Yes, bitcoin has 8 decimal places, but that doesn't affect the price - it's so you can send someone $10 even if the price of bitcoin is $100,000. If a billion people want to use bitcoin, not everyone can own an entire coin - the supply/demand would push the price for a whole coin to crazy levels.
