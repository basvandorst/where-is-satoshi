The internet is changing fast in that it is quickly becoming a big part of every facet of our lives. We can debate this all day and still never agree... let's just wait instead and see who is right.

if you start hosting something highly illegal like images of children being harmed or government secrets they wont even know about it until the men in black come knocking on their door. if that happens they need to be able to give them a way of tracking you down otherwise they are in a lot of trouble.

Yeah, that was my original concern. the solution you are talking about is just slightly over my head though. i think if this is the path i will take i'll just direct people to a facebook or twitter accout out something and then have the QR code there. this would still be exploitable but not by as much.

wouldn't it be badass if china started actually fostering the growth of bitcoin? it would throw the western world for a loop for sure.

buying essentials like basic food and necessary clothing is a very small drop in the bucket. its nothing compared to more elastic type of spending, most importantly investing in business start-ups.

i guess we are going to have to disagree on this one. the good news is that time will eventually tell us who is right.

how can you tip someone with bitcoin if they are not a bitcoin user? i feel stupid asking. i am a very tech savy guy and have been cheering for bitcoin for about a year now. still don't know how a lot of it works.
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:12:29
no, its over. bitcoin is done. please just give all your coin to me.  i'll dispose of them for you... they are worth less than $600 each. pretty much worthless.
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:23:24
actually his advice is sound even if you understand bitcoin perfectly. looking at bitcoin as an investment in itself is stupid. you are better off spending that money on scratch tickets.
on the other hand, BC is a great way to destroy transaction fees and make payments a whole lot easier and faster.

well normally there is some proof that an agreement was made. in this case it would be peter todd doing a bunch of work for the other party. if they go off and patent some of the work after and claim they never agreed it is going to be pretty obvious that they are full of shit.
@_date: 2015-05-01 23:51:52
that's entirely different. that would be making changes to a legal agreement itself. i suppose if you crossed out the part that said "signature" then scribble something in the signature space... even then it is pretty obvious that you aren't doing something in good faith. but hey, don't take my word for it. you go right ahead and try to pull this! prove me wrong.

lol asking reddit not to be dicks. what next, you going to ask them to start thinking for themselves?
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:13:13
whatever makes you feel better but i doubt it would afford you much actual legal protection. you can sign whatever you want on the dotted   line but its still proof that you are in agreement.
@_date: 2015-05-01 21:43:48
but according to this logic a person could never change their signature. this is obviously not the case. people change their sig all the time.

the author is an idiot. the house edge will fall but it wont get all the way down to 0%. There will always be costs to cover. These games don't just magically appear and then maintain themselves. There will also be marketing costs. Most importantly **security costs**. Bots aren't going to be able to do all these things for us. 
Sure, they could pay for the services through banner ads or something but why bother with that when they could just take 1%. I occasionally gamble and the idea of donating 1% to the house in exchange for quality service seems extremely reasonable to me.

why in the world would you sign "refused" in the signature spot if you wanted to decline the offer? unless you were trying to pull a fast one on the party making the offer, you wouldn't. it is pretty common knowledge that if you don't agree with the contract you don't sign.
if the law worked in the way you suggest then it would suddenly open the door to all sorts of frivolous disagreements and dishonest deals. anytime anyone signed something the other party would have to carefully analyze the signature to make sure there are no hidden messages that could later be used to refute a claim. writing a signature would suddenly be something that took enormous amounts of care and precision, maybe more than some people with bad handwriting are capable of.
and yet you don't *ever* see anyone carefully looking at the signature after it is made. if what you wrote in the signature box mattered that much every lawyer would own a well used magnifying glass. they don't.

yes, in recent years it has been profitable but it took a lot of time to get there. if you go back just 4-5 years you will see that there was a real struggle to monetize the service. even now a lot of its profit comes from the fact that it is so damn huge. a gambling service could never hope to reach the size of facebook. but then why would it even have to? 
@_date: 2015-05-01 19:34:34
Your signature can be anything you want it to be and it's still valid. If you sign on the dotted line where is says "signature" then you are agreeing to everything in the contract. It's not a space designated for you to explain anything. It's just for you to make a mark and show that you agree. If you make a mark it's a sign you agree.

i don't really understand this concept. but is it really more simple to execute than a small house edge? we can come up with all sorts of complicated ways a gambling service can draw revenue but nothing is going to be as straightforward and easy to implement as a rake or house edge.
@_date: 2016-01-31 20:33:14
facebook has struggled for years to become profitable, google is a special case that doesn't really transfer over to this sort of service. they could try all sorts of creative ways to make money off these sorts of gambling services but nothing is going to be as simple and effective as the house edge.

i thought it was the democrats that used the "fake news" excuse.
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:07:27
selling ads are your website are almost always a bad idea. there is hardly any money in it and it pisses off your users.
@_date: 2016-02-01 00:06:18
oh, i see what you are saying, so like a $0.001 service charge on each bet? yeah i guess that's a good way to go about monetizing a gambling service. its pretty much the same thing as having a rake. 
@_date: 2016-09-03 14:34:37
they should just offer some sort of flat-rate fee if users want to list bitcoin on the platform.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:38:08
my apologies. i don't mean to come off that way. just begging for some straight answers.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:01:16
haha thats a really interesting site. i dunno if i will use it but its entertaining to read.
@_date: 2017-07-01 18:41:40
aw man. this is like the saddest post i've read in awhile. you seem like a cool guy to me.
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:47:02
Haha the cam site was one of the larger more popular ones. It was as legit as cam sites get.

gambling is just ultra high yeld, ultra high risk investment.
