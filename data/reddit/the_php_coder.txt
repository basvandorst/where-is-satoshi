They are legally bound to compensate you (if you were to ask for it) otherwise there'll be no difference left between it and a piece of paper.

The government is also composed of people right? Just saying!

Erm, even a $100 bill or currency note is actually only "worth" $100, it doesn't mean you already "have" $100. It only represents a promise from US Treasury Dept. that they'll compensate you with $100 *value* in exchange for that note. Now, when you spend that $100 on a pizza or burger or noodles, that's when you actually *have* $100 worth of value.

What about Holland and Norway and also a large part of Europe? They are liberal AF, perhaps more so than their Asian counterparts. And Asia's dominance is more due to them being early adopters than the state of bitcoin regulation in their countries.

First, make sure this mail really is from PayPal Inc. (check the raw email format and the from field). Sometimes, their local marketing department sends these mails in a bid to collect some data about you which they aren't authorized to.

Read about money multiplier theory in economics. The more people spend and money changes hands (X pays to Y, Y pays to Z, etc.), the more will be the value creation in economy. If people hoard money (or bitcoins) instead, that money will be useless and it won't result in value creation.

More like Shaolin vs Lama, or Samurai vs Ninja. Kinda rift between followers of the same cult ensues, and they go their separate ways, happens all the time.

And also the dollar symbol.

If you are claiming volatility based on USD fluctuations, it doesn't matter to true BTC enthusiasts at all (those who want to invest in technology, not the richness). And also, that volatility reflects the interactions BTC-USD economies, it shouldn't affect BTC per se at all.

Bitcoin has both good and challenging aspects for future.
The good aspect is that the *tech* behind the BTC is decentralized, universal and can't be controlled by a state, so it has a bright future.
The not so good aspect is that BTC (as a currency) will always stay an enemy to the state because they can neither control it like USD, nor track it - unless the user has deanonymized herself by making her wallet details known to an exchange, or keeping the wallet online on the exchange itself.
As a result, the state will try its best to thwart BTC usage by spreading FUD and imposing regulations on banks for BTC trade - so that users don't get to interact much with their cash economy using the BTC economy. If it starts happening more, they'll impose unfair taxes and penalties on BTC traders (as is happening now). In other words, they'll try their level best to keep the BTC economy outside and separated from their country's economy (cash+goods). When a business becomes large enough (like Amazon/eBay/Google/Microsoft), it'll be watched to ensure that they aren't accepting BTC. All of this isn't good for BTC future.
All of these tactics by the state will work until the point when the average user doesn't understand (or is negatively poised towards)  BTC. The moment when the average and non-technical user starts asking them questions about BTC, that's when the real win of BTC will start! That's the point when the state will no longer find it feasible to use these tactics (without being accused of being tyrannical or fascist) and at least the smaller businesses will be able to trade freely in BTC without any fear. This stage has perhaps already come in some liberal countries like Norway and Sweden but not in most of the world.

That's true and its also true of almost everything valuable in the universe. Belief is an essential part of value creation.

That logic applies to securities market too (google about "penny stocks"). For a stock costing 20 cents, it isn't that difficult to jump to 40 cents (50% increase) because not much capital or market demand is needed to do that. But for a blue chip stock costing 1500 USD, its a gigantic effort to move even 10% because a lot of capital is needed to move its price! The higher you climb, its easier to fall down but difficult to climb even higher.

Twitter can implement a bot or user account to do this. For example, if I tweet something like "  100" will result in tipping of 100 satoshis from my account to  account!

What happens in the no man's land (such as Atlantic or Pacific Ocean)? Is bitcoin legal there?

It was near the moon once but then came down to the seas, its somewhere around the ozone layer right now.

A diametrically opposite advice than this but one that works nevertheless:

What BTC needs is that the genuine ppl should come forward and others should form a cult around them. When FOSS revolution started in 90s, there were scammers and bad eggs too but people recognized the contribution of good ppl like RMS and Linus Torvalds and started paying attention to them. That must happen in crypto now!

Gold has an added quality of "scarcity", hence it weighs above stainless steel and copper, so both scarcity and belief in that scarcity are needed for a thing to be more valuable.

Hey dude, but actually I'm the Satoshi (even got a state driving license to prove it!).

Exactly. Its as if Microsoft store has started accepting bitcoins.
