Nah, this movie is good. The choreography is top notch. Go for it,
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:55:58


Nope. In terms of revenue, Bollywood is still far ahead.

Man, Bengali film industry's decline is a real tragedy. Form Satyajit Da, Mrinal sen etc., now we have shitty Dev and Jeet movies.

And Dangal crossed Bahubali. Besides, one film doesn't mean anything. We are talking about the entire industry here.


Well yeah. And Kollywood and Tollywood lift from Hollywood. So it's all a circle.
Besides, I am no Bollywood fan. I was talking about revenues, not the quality of movies.

It is. For starters, curry is more liquified, not powdery.
@_date: 2017-08-13 13:02:46
That's not curry. It's holi colours.

Check [this]( one out.

Now we are just stuck remaking south Indian and Bollywood movies. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:27:35


Nope. Only for the Hindi language ones. And Bollywood only accounts for like 25% of Indian films.

Two words for you:
Emraan Hashmi
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:26:09
It's pretty good actually. Has some nice acting and cool action.

[Here]( you go.

If you're into historical epics then yeah. I loved the movie
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:54:17
Yup. "Bajirao Mastani"
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:50:35
Delhi Belly had a very specific north Indian based humour. It doesn't translate well for any outsiders watching it.
I love that movie, BTW. It's a cult favourite here.

Your buddy's a cousin of Priyanka Chopra? Damn. She's pretty famous.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:39:16
They might but many of the references are very specific to the region.

@_date: 2017-11-29 07:27:43
