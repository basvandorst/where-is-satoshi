Well, the bank was the jerk.  As an example, I could not cancel recurring payments to Blockbuster video for 11 months.  An investigation was opened several times and always confirmed that I was a member.  I could not log in to cancel my membership as their computer indicated that my account did not exist.  Blockbuster insisted that I was not a member on the phone and refused to fix it.  That was the last time I used recurring transactions.
I'd much rather automate payments from my own account without a jerk or two in the middle.

Banks only work because they can always replace lost funds with freshly-printed fiat.  You can try to replicate the stuff that monkeys built, but unless you go the fiat way, there is no way to protect these 'multibillion dollar organizations'. 
Consider VISA.  Does anyone have more at stake then protecting their precious credit card numbers (the mere posession of a credit card number is equivalent to having a private key)?  Just a couple of months ago, VISA, via Target lost enough keys to populate a country larger than an average European nation and give each resident a credit card or two.  That's just one incident.  VISA loses more data than anyone can imagine every year.  
These organizations are like enormous sacks of cash sitting in the street, protected by an arrogant bully with a slingshot.  Keeping your computer virus-free (which is a good idea whether you have a wallet on it or not) is a lot better than trying to protect a centralized banking infrastructure.

Points?  The kickback points are priced in - the merchant gets charged 2-3%, the credit card gives you something to shut you up.  The merchant raises prices 5%.  Without credit cards, prices go down.  No chargebacks? Prices go down.  Avoiding fraudulent sellers is the buyer's responsibility, not the bank's.
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:40:00
Just to clear it up.  Forget fiat banking.  Here are two options for cryptocurrencies:
* You have a wallet with full control of your money, no fees.  There is a 'schedule a recurring payment' button.  You can schedule and cancel payments yourself, as you wish.
* You have a 'bank' wallet, with third party control of your money.  They charge you fees.  There is a 'schedule a recurring payment' button.  You can schedule and cancel payments by notifying the third party, and a 'no-quibble dispute mechanism'.
You would actually choose the second?  And call for regulation of cryptocurrencies, since now there is a third party involved?

@_date: 2014-02-19 01:35:02
All right, a serious answer.  There is no 'central authority'.  the network is designed so that every 10 minutes or so, a bounty of newly-minted coin (currently 25BTC) is issued via a lottery to one of the miners (or a pool of miners) who are running hashing computations to 'guess the winning number'.  The winner gets to package up all the pending transactions and attach them to the blockchain.
There is a fixed, automated schedule of how the bounty changes over time.  It started with 50BTC, then was cut to 25BTC, and will be cut according to this schedule until there is no more new coin issued, and a 'steady state' will ensue.  At that point miners will be paid purely by transaction fees (hopefully the transactions will be in the millions per 10-minute block by then).
There is no one to step in to issue more currency to pay for a corrupt bailout or war.
You are right, supply and demand are the only things that matter in pricing vs. other currencies.

Malleability is not really a problem of Bitcoin.  Some businesses chose to ignore the usual 6 confirmations, and to identify transactions by a number not designed to be used as a unique identifier.
Basically, imagine that I pay you rent with a red envelope every month.  One month the post office notices the the envelope is ripped, and repackages it in a blue envelope. You call me and tell me you never got my rent, since you never got the red envelope.  I am a moron, so I send you another check.  
This happens over and over until I am broke, so I say the banking system is broken and demand changes.

@_date: 2014-02-08 22:13:27
I've been trying to tell anyone who would listen.
Now that ASIC pools have pushed out everyone else from mining, they have gained an incredible amount of power.  You can see that some are forcing higher transaction fees.
The situation will come to a head soon, perhaps the next time block reward is halfed.  It will become a serious issue when the reward is very small and transaction fees make up most of the block bounty.
You see, you cannot chose **who** processes your transaction.  You have to leave it to the market, and hope it's a free market where miners compete for your transaction fees.
With a wide hashing distribution large players can say "we won't process transactions without a .005 fee", but others will say "great, we'll take the money, more for us".  Large players will suffer losses, and back off.
The way things stand, there are only large players.  So we'll just have to give up and pay higher fees.
These dynamics apply to pools as well, which makes me wonder if there someday there will be a pool-resistant coin....  (You read it here first!)

It's not a bug.  There are many 1 dollar bills I can pay you with.  If I pay you with a dollar bill in a blue envelope and the messenger switches it to a red envelope, I still paid you a dollar.  To track payments by the colour of the envelope is not a bug with the currency.

Let's stay with cryptocurrencies.  Recurring transactions are easy - the software just has to support it.  Without any third party.  Schedule transactions in your own wallet software, or have your Zero Trust wallet provider add that feature.

Freedom implies responsibility.  You can cry for government regulation (and suffer the consequences), or you can just be responsible for your own transaction.

@_date: 2016-06-19 04:06:54
How does one decide whether the code operates as intended?  I think it operated exactly as intended.
The definition of the DAO contract is embodied in code as it executes on solidity, no exceptions (according the them!).  It executed, and it's just fine.
Do you think we should have a court, elected judges and a jury to decide moral issues?
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:01:07
Let's not confuse morality with what a blockchain is supposed to do, which is to remain immutable.
BTW, any reasonable definition of theft requires a physical item that is no longer there after such theft.  The windows example just doesn't cut it, you are confusing bad laws with morality.
However, in this case no property was stolen.  An unknown beneficiary to the contract stepped in and transferred funds.  The fact that he is capable of sending coin (and that supposedly owners cannot prevent him from doing so) is enough of an indication that he is the rightful owner.  He who can send coin owns such coin.
@_date: 2016-06-19 02:24:20
Still, in the future be careful.  In bitcoinland, he who holds the private keys owns the coin.

@_date: 2016-06-19 15:35:23
The writers of the contract specified that the contract in its entirety embodied in the code as executed.  They stated that no outside changes or interpretation will ever be valid.
 
The github page further states: "If you create a DAO it will be your DAO, and you will be responsible for its operation."
I am not ruling out that the contract was built for all investor funds to be transfered.  A simple precaution, as in "should more than 5% be transfered to a new subdao, an extra signature is required" would have mitigated much damage.
It is not up to me (or you) to make value and moral judgments about the intent of contract writers.  There is a machine for determining that.  It's just not our business, much like returning mtgox money. 
No need to get upset.
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:26:06

According to many at r/ethereum and most at r/thedao, the blochain is immutable unless a bad man is holding funds that 'belong' to buterin's friends.  Since they know right and wrong, they are lobbying the miners to fork and give the funds back, even though it would obviously destroy eth.  Idiots.

Standard legal/political university training.
Start with people with nothing to say, and teach them to speak in circles, hitting "important" key words and phrases identified in focus groups.  Bring any questions back to memorized monologs.
Once you learn to detect it, watching politicians and lawyers talk is better than comedy.  Especially when some reporter makes them really squirm and contort to bring completely unrelated subjects back to the normal droning thread.  Really funny when the speaker is really stupid, which is generally the case.
A good fun game (especially if you have kids) is to identify the important keyword of a particular speach, and count how many times they use it.  Kids are really good at it.

 It would look a lot like what you see now, a parabolic spike.  I doubt a real hedge fund is doing this now (a small hedge fund with a few billion to invest has no business with our piddly wares).  Right now, I think it's some dotcommer with some chump change (a few million bucks) getting in.
Given how hard it is for the average guy to enter the market (see my post  ), it is extremely easy for a 'large player' to manipulate the market.  Say drive it up until the feeding frenzy begins, supply the new demand by selling at $80, $90, $100, then watch it collapse back to $20 and do it again.
That is why I think it's really important for the rest of us to have a way to fight back to restore stability.

A smart way to introduce a technology like this is _precisely_ as bitcoin has been introduced.  An anonymous contribution of pretty clean code (many agree too clean for one person).  Emails suggesting fixes and solutions until it works.  Then, Whoosh.  No trace of the inventor.  Once the currency is real and big, no one can possibly keep a lie going - satoshi had to 'disappear' long before anyone started digging to find out who he is.

I did not realize that miners validate transactions.

BAD ARGUMENT.  Audio CDs had an inherent value of the actual plastic disc and the cost of stamping data.  The rest of the so called 'value' was guaranteed by coersive laws and enforced by men with guns and concrete cages.  The cost of the CDs went away, leaving the 'value' even more questionable then ever.
Bitcoin is not a replacement for anything physical.  It's simply a payment system that is owned by no one, and one that is completely immune to cheating (though not human error and stupidity).
Bitcoin is also the world's most traceable and trackable currency.  All transactions ever made can be looked at.  Some groups that have access to ISP records and Internet hubs know exactly who made each one those transactions.

This is actually tricky, since you don't have a gain until you sell.

Let's assume there is an encryption mechanism in place that obscures all transactions in which the sender's address and the recipient's address are not involved in.
Now the recipient's client can scan the blockchain looking for spends on the sender's address.  Those would be visible.
Edit: the transactions need not be public, just accessible to parties that require access.  A snoop will not be able to decipher anything outside of their own transactions; if everyone uses disposable addresses, there is absolutely no information leaking to reconstruct the transaction log.

It's a guarantee that the document is authentic.  Whether it stands up in court (or any bitcoin transactions stand up in court) is another matter.  It is a common sense way to offer a guarantee of authenticity of a document, its creation date, and facilitate a 'meeting of the minds' ad-hoc contract.  Hopefully with bitcoin we can avoid a lot of legal crap and this is one extremely low cost, zero-trust way to make sure, for instance that the wording of a contract is not changed.

All that assumes that your computer is at all anonymous.  That is generally false.
Google tracks most website visits across the internet and keeps them in a file complete with your google searches, gmail, google maps searches, youtube logs, etc.
Erasing the cookie is not enough; blocking flash is not enough; blocking the scripts is not enough.  Firefox regularly forwards the URLS you try to access to google to check if it's 'safe'.  Just for fun, go to 'about:config' and search for 'google'.  And your browser request footprint is enough for google to identify you.
Using TOR is not enough unless you disable everything and don't go to sites like this one - this site gets ajax from google (who graciously hosts ajax), sending it your information.  This way most businesses turn over their customer logs to google without thinking twice.
That's just google; there are hundreds of others keeping track of your web usage.
In short, if you ever use google (and the the Internet generally) and are talking about anonymity, chances are you have no clue.

@_date: 2013-03-21 21:07:37
Atypical for normal securities, but probably does not apply here.  A possibility exists that BTC has been severely underpriced due to lack of market exposure.  The market is thin, nearly impossible to move large funds in, and ridiculous arbitrage opportunities exist across larger exchanges, meaning that liquidity is still poor.  
My guess is that there will be a reconing, of course.  However with the market entry gate being the size of a pisshole, anyone trying to move a million bucks in will move the market up 10 points or so.   i wouldn't be surprised if BTC goes to $250 and has a terrible crash to $110.
@_date: 2013-03-26 06:06:50
I think current public key encryption technology can accomplish what I am suggesting, which is that only the parties involved exchange keys necessary to verify the transaction, check for double spends, etc.
The way bitcoin operates, it looks like you need to see one transaction back to verify source.  That sucks but at least it limits the visibility to parties involved, not everyone.  And you can move funds to another address to hide the source.
I am really concerned that when I ask why the chain is not encrypted, all the cryptomaniacs all of a sudden yell at me that it should be plaintext.  Who benefits from the chain?  It's nice that we can all verify transactions, but do we really?  We can authenticate them and know they are real without knowing the details.
The same people who argue encryption is the way to go, all of a sudden take the 'we have nothing to hide' attitude.

No, this is not a wash sale.  A wash sale happens if you buy and sell the same kind of securities within 30 days, and the result is that you cannot deduct losses.

Loss is not a factor for an entity that prints currency.

As a parting shot, I can't resist to point out that the crash worked entirely to bitcoin's favor, as well as the well-publicised blockchain splits and other screwups.

That depends on how badly they want to put you away.
The laws actually say any cash transactions (buy or sell) that result in the sum total over $10,000 in a continuous 12-month period = structuring.
So technically, withdrawing $200 per week from an ATM classifies you as a felon.  Obviously you won't go to jail for JUST that, but now it's easy to get a warrant and go fishing through your house and computers.

At the risk of making you think I am a paranoid idiot, I will back off the technical details (which I don't think are insurmountable) and question the motivation of creating a system in which every transaction is logged.
Really think hard.  10 years from now a large chunk of the economy moves via bitcoin.  States grudgingly accept it.  Who benefits from being able to see your bank account, with every transaction meticulously logged and verified?
My money is on google, although the states get a side benefit.  Google right now owns the internet logs.  The only thing they don't know about their user is their financial transactions.
From the technical side, I understand the problems, but it looks doable, although possibly slightly different.  The miner may have to be cut out of the verification loop since a bad miner could be logging a lot of unencrypted data.  The receiver may have to check for doublespends in the blockchain.  The system has to assure that all transactions from the same address are open to the recipient.  An opaque verification, on something like a hash of the transaction instead of the transaction itself is open to all to assure the system integrity...  I've considered the technical side of this for about 12 hours, so if I am saying something stupid, forgive me.  It does not take away from the issues I am presenting.

I actually had my account closed by a bank for 2 $8000 withdrawals and had to consult a lawyer.  That is withdrawing my own money.  Not being aware of the structuring laws is no excuse, intent aside.
I think you've been watching too much TV lawyer shows.  They don't have to prove much to seize your computers and lock you up as a 'flight risk' while fishing for more evidence to prove anything they want.
Another thing that does not work - alibis.  That is from a friend who is an assistant DA.  Many people are rotting in jail with really good aliabis.

A gain implies a conversion back to the US$.  Consider the following scenarios after converting US$50,000 to a foreign currency:
1) spend it immediately.  No taxes.
2) spend it sometime over the next year as the currency doubles.  You get to enjoy double the money and may be subject to taxes???
3) wait for it to double and convert back to US$100,000.  Taxed on 50,000 gain.
4) spend it over the next 10 years, not paying attention to conversion rates.  Have to report to FinCEN if it's in a bank account.  Tracked and probably taxable on currency gains??? (CPAs chime in please)

These are weak points.  Consider the dollar:
1) there is no reasonable way to secure dollar-denominated accounts, as they are subject to taxation (especially brutal when you die), devaluation and confiscation.  Who do you think pays for your bank account when it's made whole after it's 'stolen'?  Where does the money come from?  Maybe you shouldn't be careless enough that your money can be easily stolen instead of depending on the government to replace it after the fact.
2) Most businessmen are (thankfully) concerned with making money by supplying demand and not revolutionizing the world or for god's sake, creating a Greater Good (reminds me of Hitler Youth slogans).  The use of baiting language ('cheerleeders') gives you away as a jackoff trying to start a fight.
3) The value of any currency is based on limited supply and demand.  I don't know what you mean by 'inflated' here.  If people are demanding a product, they are not inflating anything.  And bitcoin is doing fine after many 'disasters', proving its hardiness.  Bitcoin, due to its unreplicatable nature is less 'virtual' than any paper currency.

Cornering the market does not work in a real free market (look it up).  Since the fiat side of the market is not free, there is room for foul play.  However, consider that there is no way to buy the market.  You can buy whatever outstanding asks there are on the exchanges, raising the price.  That will invite new sellers, but eventually people will realize the market is going to the moon and ask more than a huge multimillionaire could afford.
What happens if one entity is holding a large chunk of outstanding coin?  The rest of it will be in higher demand, demanding a higher price.  It would be steady.
Should the bastard then dump, things would get ugly for a while as others will see big volume on the sell side and lower their prices to frontrun the huge sale.  The prices would collapse.
Some of this volatility can be avoided with healthy futures and options markets, something we desperately need.
This would of course not benefit our multimillionaire in any meaningful way.  There are better ways to invest and speculate.

Don't mean to be an a'hole, but I knew a guy in NYC a few years back who received a $50,000,000 bonus after a good year, on top of god knows what salary, trading bonds.  If the fed keeps printing and giving it to wall street, that's how it works.  These guys measure client wealth in 'units'.  A Unit is US$100,000,000.00.  So on that scale, 20k is chickensh*t.

Fiat money is more 'virtual' than bitcoin as it can be (and is) printed in ever-increasing amounts.  Bitcoin has absolute limits imposed on the total outstanding volume.  This makes it impossible for governments to counterfit the currency to fund their 'important' projects.
Combine the tight supply of bitcoin with spikes in demand, and you have price jumps like the one we are experiencing now.  This is not a 'bubble', just supply and demand ebbing and flowing.  Since bitcoin is money, it's not really the price of bitcoin fluctuating, but the price of the dollar as well.

Thanks, but hmm, what's the point?  The sites will figure out how to deal with DDOS attacks or disappear, and I certainly don't care to see which site happens to be incompetent enough to be down on a minute-by-minute basis.
It's sort of convenient to have a dozen links handy, but my firefox bookmarks do the trick just fine.  Why would I want you to collect logs of bitcoin users (and when you are hacked have them come and try to hack my computer?).  Why would you want this information anyway?
Also, the page forwards my IP address to google via googleapis.com...  So yeah, google gets a list of bitcoin users as well.  Google will never erase their logs.  Great.  Thanks.  tip -$10

The recipient can still verify the transaction - recipient has access to the relevant records in the chain, the ones that involve the originating address.  I don't understand why miners are in charge of verification anyway.

I am a bitcoin proponent.  Peter has never been fast on his feet.  One thing that no one mentions is that bitcoin requires a well-functioning internet to work.  In SHTF scenario, it is likely to be worse then useless.  Worse because it is likely that islands of separate networks are likely to exist, completely splitting the blockchain.  So that is about the only argument against bitcoin one could make, but no one does.

Let's stay away from things like 'debit cards' that defeat the whole purpose of bitcoin - no trusted third party involvement.  
If we fall into that trap, bitcoin will become the tool used by banks to transfer funds, and we will be back to where we are today, begging for privacy and transparency as the banks administer our lives.

4) Someone with all the power of all the miners would be able to mess around with the top block only.  The system is build to deal with that.  It would be more beneficial for that person to be paid for their cracking power, since it's exactly the same work required for mining.

I think, the way it works, if you buy a quantum machine that's 1000 times more powerful than ASIC miners, you would have a choice of subverting the bitcoin network or making most of the bitcoin there is to mine, a block every 10 minutes, I believe.

my guess is that prices will go up for a bit more ($130?) before collapsing to something more reasonable like $45 if it happens this month.  If bitcoin catches traction in the next 3 years or so (it should - what's the competition? Paypal?)  I would guess $2000 is a realistic price.
To answer your question - long term it doesn't really matter what I pay now.

Grammar check:
[As a female economist] [this is a horrible idea] [and could destroy the world]
Are you in fact saying:
**This horrible idea -- a female economist-- could destroy the world.**
Some people think that female economists are not always bad.
Otherwise, it is a horrible idea to start the sentence with 'as a ...' without 'I think that'.  For example, consider:
As a banker, the boat sunk fast.
As a lawyer, the murderer should be sentenced to death.
As a student, the chair was uncomfortable.
So, if you, the female economist, are the subject, then both of these apply to you, as a female economist:
 --this is a horrible idea
 --it could destroy the world.
Also, what does 'as a female economists' mean?  Do you have a multiple economist personality?  Are you singular (implied by the 'a') or plural (economists)? 
I hope you are not a native English speaker.  Otherwise, as a female economist, you are not very good at expressing yourself.  You are a disgrace to all female economists!  Shoo!

If you take $10 out of your bank, wave a magic wand turning it to 20 you have a taxable event.  You'd have a hard time convincing any judge or jury that because you changed into virtual bits somehow doubling your money doesn't count.  The money speaks for itself.  If you wind up with more than you started, it's either earned income or capital gain.
I hope you are keeping your hypothetical bitcoin safe and don't use this computer you are posting from to ever touch the stash.  Create a new clean machine with nothing but a wallet.  Linux, not windows or mac.  Seriously, dude.

Do you mean mailing address?
Generally, bitcoin transactions are irreversible, and sending to a dead address means that the money is gone - since someone would have to have a private key to this non-existent address to get coin out of it.  If it were possible to crack a key, the whole bitcoin system would be worthless, so by definition you can't get your money back, if I understood you correctly.
Check if the transaction has been confirmed in blockchain.info or your wallet.  If so, I think there is nothing to do.
We've gone soft dealing with reversible transactions.  There is little room for stupidity with bitcoin.

It really depends on the number of users vs the number of hoarders.  A lot more people are in since 2011; and until hedge fundies start blowing in and out (god help us then as far as volatility goes) it shouldn't be so bad.
As people realize, going from theoretical (bitcoin sounds good) to investment (it's going up, let's buy) to holy f*ck, this is great (as I just did after getting tipped a couple of bucks) things will change too.  I wouldn't be so fast to dump the only way to bank without a banker, privately and securely, even if I had to sit through a major dip.

I am seriously concerned about google logs correlated to blockchain transactions.  
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:57:50
You are missing the point.  Once your transaction is in the chain, every 10 minutes after that a new block will be appended.  So 2 confirmations will take 20 (on average) minutes after the initial inclusion.  There is no 'confirmation' really, just your block getting deeper.
The transaction fee is for including your transaction AT ALL into the original block.  Personally I think that's a problem - not knowing if your transaction will be included into the blockchain defeats the purpose of the whole thing...
But just remember that you can't pay for confirmations - it is simply a function of how deep your transaction is buried.

Let's say all major US cities have a period of a few days when localized Internet service is active but interconnectivity is bad or non-existent.  Let's say there are 50 major blockchains after the split.  Let's say NYC is the biggest one at the rejoining time with  5% of all transactions.  What happens now? How feasible is it to restore this mess?
