upvote for not believing what someone says just because they have a flashy resume. we're all human and the smartest people in the room are often wrong. to accept what someone says 'as gospel' is to stop asking questions.. while still asking for trouble.

hi there, i specifically defined what -I- mean by fungible to avoid confusion. if you read what i wrote from that perspective you might see that i am also quite explicit in potential consequences of lacking that feature, far more relevant in my view than anything to do with mount gox. regarding your views on fungibilty features apparently being easy to do - or even feasible, i suggest you do some further research, as all i have found in my research have pointed it to being nigh insurmountable when business and user base risks are taken into consideration. finally, the assumption that all software is adaptable -to any useful degree- is not true.  best izzy

fyi, in many ways it's unsurprising that in practice debt came first over 'spot' trade - especially considering that our immediate natural inclinations with regard to 'stuff' tend to be of a more base nature (hence, indebtedness and all the baggage carried there vs a clean value exchange). this doesn't eliminate the prospect though of aspiring to a higher expression.

as i tried to make fairly clear, aspects of the histories i use are apocryphal. once that is understood, i like to think more major points can be appreciated.
