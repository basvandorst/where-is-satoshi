the future of Africa is starvation and misery, just like the past and present of Africa. Although poverty and bitcoin do seem to be linked...

Well, perhaps as a percentage of their total populations poverty is not increasing, and tbh I doubt even that, but definitely as a total number its increased just due to the massive population growth in many of Africa's countries. I do think things like greater communications access and some way to transfer local money into something useful online or with better stability than local funbux can help local vendors and the like in those countries, but idk if something like bitcoin is ready to fill that gap considering its own volatility problems currently or the ease by which people seem to defraud or steal bitcoin from each other.
I'm not trying to be a debbie downer guys, I just can't suspend my disbelief for Bill Gates' latest zany schemes.

yeah i mean Africa is a huge and fertile continent divided into a bunch of shitty, poorly run countries that depend on the largesse of Western countries to feed those they currently have while the population grows at breakneck speed, but cryptocurrencies and cheap smartphones are going to save them all lmao.

It'll never happen. People (not all, obviously) knew this was a scam and still threw their money in with crooks at a chance at an easy score. I'm glad to see dishonesty and avarice punished though IDK if any of the scammers will get caught up.

Sorry it just sounds like magical thinking to me. How many of these people are illiterate and don't speak a language used anywhere outside their little corner of the world? Probably a large minority at least. From what I see as a layman and outsider the best bet for future prosperity is to redraw countries around ethnic boundaries to decrease political instability and ethnic violence so endemic in certain African countries today. Perhaps giving incentives to skilled people i.e. scientists, capitalists, and the like to immigrate to their countries to help build or rebuild the infrastructure especially for sanitation, transport, and agriculture.
