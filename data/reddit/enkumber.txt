Paypal can go and f*** themselves. I'm only using them because i have no other choice sometimes. However, they are blocking accounts and they are allowing scammers to take your money. They don't even give reasons for their actions and I only wish PAYPAL to go bankrupt!

I didn't even know that's possible to deposit without ID. In my country it was like that since I first entered a bank... 
@_date: 2014-09-30 07:53:16
I could add the Mastercard but I coudn't buy BTC with it. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 21:09:13

@_date: 2014-12-09 10:37:04

I saw your new post about the police search. I did 3 orders on purse andof course now I'm scared about it. I see you knew about these charges prior to the search. Can I ask when did you found out about it? I mean 1 month after the orders or two months ?

a decentralized alternative to uber. pay with bitcoin to get a ride, be paid in bitcoin to be a driver
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:08:26
of course, this alternative to uber would be impossible to be censored in any country ...

It just says the keys were exported but it doesn't do anything. I've read somewhere that key export is broken in 0.8.0
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:40:53
i don't think so ...
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:34:09
I have the same problem ...
@_date: 2015-03-11 09:23:13
if only they would reply ... anyway if the key could be exported it would not be a problem ...
