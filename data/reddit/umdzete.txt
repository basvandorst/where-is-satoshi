This is why we have the second ammendment in the USA. Seriously, britain was oppressing us, so we rose up and ousted them. Thats why its in the constitution, the founders believed it was a check on the government

Uh actually this is much less volatile, if I can deposit BTC, convert it into dollars, bet, then withdraw in BTC. I don't have to worry about any fluctuations in the value of BTC when placing my bets.
You're just promoting your own service, 5 dimes has a trusted history and some of the bigger names in sports betting starting to accept BTC will put you right out of business, focus on finding a new way to innovate and be better, rather than making misleading and false attacks about your competitors

I mean... Life's not a Disney movie man, there's bad people, I don't know how else say it. There has to be some authority, it's not always obvious badness like car jackers rapists and molesters. It's people like Hitler who were universally loved by his own people until shit got weird. Or Bernie Madoff who was a hugely respected successful individual until the house of cards came down

The other day I was depositing cash at MT bank to go home and buy BTC from coin base and I thought, how funny would it be to just walk up, flop down the cash, and ask to purchase bitcoins. Like some person who didn't understand them but knew they wanted them, and assumed a bank could help. I didn't follow through, but what of we all started doing this regularly? It could start to get a banks attention. You can do it with Euros or other currency, why not BTC? What if we organized a day to all go to our local banks and try to plunk down cash for BTC, seeing how much cash they aren't getting could change some minds.... Just a thought I had
@_date: 2014-03-02 02:22:53
Is that really a thing? I'm not sure why I'm surprised...
@_date: 2014-04-29 23:51:03

I'm not saying this to be a prick but it is worth stating. 
There's actually a great saturable novel by MaxBerry I'd recommend where the basic premise is that tax has been eliminated and capitalism is thriving. It goes a little far, but the set up is very thought provoking, the novel is Jennifer Government by Max Berry, one of my favorite quick reads

Being from Maryland Id like to throw in somewhere in the DMV, a lot of government and tech jobs, as well as engineering. I'd love Annapolis but Baltimore is a little more realistic as long as you have a decent spot, inner harbor has likely locations and draws a lot of conventions. Other spots that are probably better would be Bethesda or Rockville in Maryland, and  Arlington or Alexandria in Virginia.

@_date: 2014-05-15 01:51:31
Here's what I sent
I was recently made aware of an upcoming upgrade to Panera's infrastructure involving installation of Kiosks for ordering and payment. I was writing because security of financial information is one of my biggest concerns as a consumer. One way to avoid such hugely ugly public disasters seen in the Target data leak would be to implement Bitcoin into your new terminals, this would allow Security conscious individuals to keep their financial information secure while also benefitting Panera's by protecting them from charge backs and saving money on credit card fees. Services sucks as Coinbase or Bitpay provide for easy implementation of this.
I hope you consider this going forward!

The fact is that high risk investments have a place in a portfolio, you don't know this guys life. he may already have enough saved up that hes set, his families set, and hes just playing around with the rest of the money. If he wants to hold some bitcoin, why can't he

It's also ridiculous because if you believed in the coming end of the world/shtf/wrol scenario take you pick, bitcoin would be an awful investment because in this world the internet would cease to exist....
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:42:35
I'd think about expanding beyond exchanges to look at other services in the bitcoin world that are suffering as a result of MTGox's demise. One such casualty seems to be bitbook.biz, I'm sure others are suffering.

This report got more things correct than any news story I've seen yet and did it while going into a much greater depth. Compare itto the wired article, that guy came her and asked for help and he still got stuff wrong and barely scratched the surface. This is a very well written and researched primer, and a lot more very important people read Stratfor than wired 
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:55:18
I highly doubt the majority of sites will do this, given that none do it currently
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:00:39
I didn't mean it as any type of hedge just that to a bank or othe relative investor, a valueless bitcoin is not in fact valueless.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:16:56
I'm certainly not SURE but I'm pretty confident if the Internet is lost, the value of your BTC is at the very least effectively Zero until it is restored
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:14:22


The second ammendment exists for that reason
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:09:53
one problem with your premise on which you base your comparison with illegal firearms... in the US anyway, its quite easy to buy illegal/unregistered/stolen/"hot" firearms and they are substantially cheaper than legal registered guns in most cases
TV shows like to hype up this illegal arms market but in reality if you can find drugs, you can find yourself a shady gun. and it will likely be anywhere from half to a third of the price of that same weapon in a local gun store
not saying this has any impact on what you're saying about bitcoin, just wanted to share some real world facts so you don't use wrong assumptions for your theories
@_date: 2014-04-19 22:09:37
Wait is it? I've met that guy through a friend...
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:42:33
Ha ha ha ha.
Wait seriously? I'm not going to actually keep track of each and every purchase and the value on the day.... However.... If I gamble with bitcoins I can now legally itemize losses I guess so there's that...
EDIT: just talked to my tax attorney, posted this elsewhere in the thread.
I actually think this will turn out to be a good thing for bringing money in. Say you're not Johnny and you actually have a decent chunk of money and you already pay capital gains on the investments you have, this would also apply if you were a bank. If the IRS says you have to claim the capital gains it means they also have to allow you to claim Capital Losses. So now a bank or otherwise wealthy person could invest 10 million in bitcoin, and if the price drops to a dime a dozen the next day, they don't have nothing. 
They have a 10 million dollar tax write off
These people but that money into charity for the write off, charity doesn't have a potential moon shot of an upside
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:18:52
Against other income sure, but if part of your portfolio is bitcoin, and it tanks, your profile is overall down. Instead of say 10mil up, you would be even. In this analogy
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:36:21
Well banks don't have everyone's dollars so coinbase fits right in!
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:22:57

I believe he was saying he was happy a nut job (Alex Jones) WASN'T on board. I'm not saying I share his viewpoint but he's positing that Glenn Beck may be a similarly... Controversial individual who would do more to discredit bitcoin. Personally while I disagree with lots of things Glenn beck says, and rarely if ever listen to him, he is not a nut job like Alex jones, he's just very polarizing.
@_date: 2014-06-08 21:40:00
Smart, makes sense
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:58:57
For myself? I mean shit it's not my form. The average person doesn't have 10k in a foreign bank account, it doesn't happen accidentally. Any responsible person in the USA has a tax preparer anyway or in my case a tax attorney. 
Is the US tax code fucked up beyond all belief? 100% yes it is. But you're making a big deal out of something that is a non issue.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:05:35

I work for a publicly traded market research firm, I posed a question to my direct supervisor about putting a project together relating to bitcoin for a major bank (we do alot of financial services research) and these are rough copies of the response that HER boss (a VP) sent back to her. I realize some of these facts are just way off, but what is the best and most tactful way to refute and respond?

That was a better read than expected... Between this, the very well written and researched Stratfor report, and the HMRC ruling last night.... shit wheres that moon guy?
@_date: 2014-07-02 04:42:12
Very cool! Thanks
@_date: 2014-05-11 14:39:06
Ok but a possible hackers watch list isn't an academic record...mom talking about getting suspended and high school grades...that stuff is meaningless as soon as you get to college
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:41:04
I bought a used car on a credit card and then immediately paid it off... Rewards points man
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:55:37
Realise, customise, apparently these are accepted spellings in some places, something I was not aware of.
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:19:20
@_date: 2014-04-30 11:35:58
Sadly that's exactly how the system is set up
@_date: 2014-03-11 23:59:06
Will you ship to Maryland? Many sites will not, but naked wines does with no hesitation, would love to switch to you
@_date: 2014-06-08 19:17:34
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:50:19
That still seems wrong
@_date: 2014-05-26 19:22:19
Coin base? You link a bank account, but beyond that I haven't been bother at all for buys or sells
@_date: 2014-05-23 22:33:48
I was just answering his question, that is, who makes that many international payments. Not saying whether or not bitcoin would be a suitable replacement
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:51:26
That's the thing, they looked out for HIS interests
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:41:50
I find simple words are easier for simple people to understand
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:22:30
Can I ask why you believe that? Serious question, I'm interested
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:12:02
So what I got from that is, outlook is brightening, but margins are tight. If your margins are tight, saving just 1% on payment processing can be a huge deal
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:51:43
Yes. Literally the Stone Age.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:40:51
Any tips?
@_date: 2014-06-15 14:56:47
I'd take this bet all day, I very much believe they will sell for above market price. I just don't know how we'll confirm because I'm not sure the auction results will be public, and I don't wanna base it on rumors and speculation 
@_date: 2014-06-16 16:24:45
Could buy plenty of those Gov coins with 96 million
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:17:37
I'm not trying to be a downer here... But how many of these organisations think that "digital currency" just means PayPal/Apple pay etc?
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:53:17
Hey I'm sure he still owns some BTC... And is waiting for everyone else to propel the price to the moon
@_date: 2014-03-26 17:32:58
You're a nut lol
@_date: 2014-10-21 07:40:42
Ugh fuck off
@_date: 2015-05-18 00:34:42
This is a horrible idea that would never take off
@_date: 2014-06-16 01:06:34
I can deal with those terms, 100mBTC it is
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:11:07
Your first statement is why it is very important NOT to have your whole portfolio be stock in the company you work for. If the company goes bankrupt, not only are you out of a job, but all your savings is now worthless. The original post should never have left /new this is one of the stupider things I've read on this sub. 
Anyone who thinks this is a good idea is too stupid to understand classic economics, fiscal responsibility, or even why bitcoin was created. But since the poster is probably 16 I'm not sure why I'd expect anything else
@_date: 2014-04-27 13:31:18
You really understand what bankrupt means do you....
@_date: 2014-05-06 23:16:07
They've been sharing info selectively for a few years, google around for the big UBS case. People haven't been using Swiss banks for some time, they went to Cyprus for a bit, some other places. I have a good friend who recently renounced his Australian citizenship in favor of Panamanian citizenship. He lives in France and Australia but doesn't want to pay taxes, panama is the hot new spot
@_date: 2014-04-20 21:35:23
I thought i started this among me and my friends, I guess it's more ubiquitous than I thought
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:04:13
Haven't been turned in yet I suppose... I mean how many drugs get delivered by mail... Though to be fair this is shipped in a big box that's plastered with their site
@_date: 2014-07-05 02:20:51
I wasn't making any sort of value judgement, just saying that he wasn't just looking to make a donation cause he felt good, he was looking to thank the people who helped him get his money back. The EFF et all were not considered because they weren't involved.
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:01:47
Merge mined and absolutely worthless
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:58:41
Shhh he took an Econ class last year
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:39:18
Finally someone who gets it. Trust but verify they always say...
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:14:23
If someone is willing to buy it, then yes. That's how the world works, bit coin is worth money because we all think it is, the mining rigs they sell are worth what they sell them for, if only because people keep buying them
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:07:38
Because the value of the car is pegged to a USD amount, say he conducts the auction in Bitcoin starting at 200BTC presently about 140,000 usd, it gets bid up to say 250BTC but the next day something drastic happens and the prices crashes to $350 a BTC so now people keep jumping in bidding it higher and higher, 500 BTC, but then the price recovers, and the auction is still on but no one is bidding, now BTC is back at $1200 each. The winning bidder is on he hook for a way larger amount an he originally thought, and most likely won't even go through with it, so he has to list the car all over again! Obviously it's hypothetical and I don't even know what the value of that car should be in USD but this is why it's much easier to auction in USD and convert at market price.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:27:06
Seriously though, anything goes? Is there stuff you absolutely won't do? 
@_date: 2014-07-22 02:33:26
Someone please make a koolaid man but with a bitcoin logo saying oh yeaaa
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:29:17
Didn't I just answer that question?
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:10:57
That's per 15min, dude paid for 30min I guess
Source. Uhhhhhh
@_date: 2014-07-07 08:10:59
Well... I'd do this for free... But I want you to hold me accountable
@_date: 2014-06-15 15:04:53
I agree one hundred percent. Invalidating the coins spits the the face of the government for seizing them, and theoretically They could be reissued
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:57:16
Or just buy... It's a deflationary currency, by trying to play the market you gain short term profits at the expense of long term gains
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:12:00
why thoughts entirely.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:39:32
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:40:36
Point taken
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:09:40
Seriously what would it actually cost? Sponsoring a fighter in a title fight especially would be huge
@_date: 2015-05-18 02:41:19
It's no complicated, in fact it's quite a simple solution
But it's a problem for the artists, not for consumers. Consumers have no desire to find new ways to pay for music
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:44:08
So I got the images to upload but for some reason imgur isn't uploading properly from my iPad... Working on it, may have to post when I get home
@_date: 2015-05-18 00:47:40
Shit post alert
@_date: 2014-03-26 00:45:47
What's your bid idea man? You sound like a sophomore who just took their first philosophy class and has been hitting the refer a little more than usual. If you have ideas spit them out, but I think you'll be hard pressed to come up with anything new
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:08:51
Yea, society is a bitch isn't it
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:08:07
Which is pointless because you need many more confirmations to know your transaction is secure
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:17:06
Looks like I may finally scoop some up
@_date: 2014-08-07 01:44:29
And as $/ghs keeps dropping your actual value has plummeted!
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:54:27
No. Sorry, fuck off shill
@_date: 2015-01-04 09:36:29
I quite fond of PHK, especially right now, my personal favorite dividend stock
@_date: 2014-06-04 12:45:06
No it's to discourage people from hiding money offshore. Just report it, are you thick or something
@_date: 2014-06-15 03:18:42
Nah like, it's their day
@_date: 2015-05-18 00:44:28
I'm sure artists would love it, users however will never adopt it
@_date: 2015-05-18 04:05:44
Artists would make more and customers pay less
But only amount those using Bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:33:06
I don't understand your point... If I have an ounce of gold it certainly has value, but I still can't walk into a walmart and buy groceries with it.
@_date: 2014-07-10 15:05:38
Despite your shitty title, he was never the managing director at Goldman Sachs
This guy is no guru, he's just a trader
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:19:41
I did think it was weird that naked wines is totally on board with it when it's pretty explicitly not allowed by statute. Ugh this state...
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:23:36
Well he hasn't been charged with anything so its not really illegal... Definitely going to lose your job though! I guess you could be charged with embezzlement? 
@_date: 2014-08-10 16:05:59
Not in my state sadly
@_date: 2015-05-18 02:53:19
But your system isn't in place, and I pay nothing for music, so how does it solve my nonexistent problem
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:09:17
This isn't a hotline issue, it's a go into your neighborhood bank and raise hell issue. They'll be able to sort it out if you want to keep the account
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:07:47
My point was just that the decline has already began. It's easy to call the top after 3 days of huge losses
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:18:48
I'm not sure you can call this the top... Off like 1300 points in 3 days of trading
@_date: 2015-07-22 04:17:25
Start using less drugs
@_date: 2015-09-02 17:24:12
Any thing is impractical to do for $100... This proves nothing
@_date: 2015-02-15 09:22:19
I'd agree it's not that surprising. Imagine turning up to a job interview knowing nothing about the company. Youre running for an election and don't read the forums... Doesn't make much sense
@_date: 2015-02-15 09:18:33
Hey now. That actually makes sense!
