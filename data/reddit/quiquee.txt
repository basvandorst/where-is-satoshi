we will see how many important banks remain in R3 after couple of years. That will bebthe measure of their success

That is not correct 
Volume 2 x 126m Japanese = 252m tx / year. 
Capacity 2tx x 3600 x 24 x 365 = 63m tx / year. 
63/252=0,25 tx /  year per Japanese or 1 tx every 4 years
But dont worry,  lightening, alts,  subchains, mimblewimble and others will come to rescue

Banks work like this: you show them Bitcoin and they reinvent distributed databases. Soon they will see teletransportation and they will decide to reinvent Skype

Hi there. nLock time will not help you with that. Your coins will be spent just that it will only happen after nLock time. You can't stop it once you have signed the transaction.

Speculators thought Bitcoin was gold and they learn today it is "just" money.
