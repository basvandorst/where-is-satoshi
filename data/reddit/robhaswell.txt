I know nothing about TA, but I think this is called a flag: 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:41:03
I think the theory is that the attacker and the chinese miners who mine all the blocks (bitmain?) have an agreement. The cost of spamming the network is paid in fees to the miners that mine it. The miners of the spam transactions return the fees to the attacker. Therefore the cost of spamming the network is very low (only paid when a different pool mines a block, which doesn't happen very often any more).
Also, it's not "millions of dollars" it's "tens of BTC", and if your goal is to discredit BTC in favour of another chain, you don't put much value in those BTC. Especially if you have 10,000s of BTC at your disposal, which some of the suspected attackers do.
I don't fully understand why this is happening, if it is, but I think it's something to do with miners wanting to make more profit with bigger blocks. Meanwhile, your mining profits during the attack are going up anyway because of the high fees.

What? Cite your source. Here's mine:

Coinbase charges you 1.49% (standard buy) / 3.9% (visa buy) ON TOP of their very unfavourable exchange rate (usually 1-3% worse rate). That is high fees. 
It is possible to make a SEPA transfer to GDAX and limit buys for 0% fees, but through Coinbase it is a rip-off.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:28:56
Here's a proper answer:
* Extremely high fees.
* Inadequate customer service.
* Poor technology performance.
Considering the extreme amount of money they must be making (from Coinbase &amp; GDAX) it is unacceptable that their CS is so shit and their tech is so brittle.
Over the last year their capabilities have only barely improved. They're not progressing at the rate one would expect. Also, they claimed to support UK customers but they do not, withdrawals and deposits via bank account are EU accounts which incur extremely high fees from the banking system.
Personally I think Coinbase have done very well, but there is lots of room to improve, and if I was looking for a startup to fund right now, a Coinbase competitor would be a pretty strong opportunity.

Story time: Yesterday my partner finally got added to our joint account that we opened, a process that started in August and was supposed to take a few days.
When her bank card arrived it was sent to the wrong address (we are moving in together and wanted it sent to our new place), but best of all, it has _the wrong name on it_. They transposed the components of her double-barrelled surname. Also, the new card has no contactless facility (the one I received months ago does).
Truly staggering incompetence.
It's good to remember that this is the system that Bitcoin is replacing.

@_date: 2017-12-12 12:31:39
Easy, tiger. I think you need to do your research on hard forks: 
The basics are that a hard fork is when Bitcoin splits (maybe think about duplicating) into a new currency. Let's call them Old Bitcoin and New Bitcoin (in this instance: Bitcoin and Super Bitcoin). The New Bitcoin is a different crypto algorithm and rules, usually. When the fork happens everyone who had Old Bitcoin now has the same amount of New Bitcoin. You access this through usually a new wallet app with your old private keys, the process varies, but when you get access you are then free to trade it.
If you're excited about free money then when you get access (claim) your New Bitcoin you can send it to an exchange and usually somebody will trade it for Old Bitcoin at about 1/10th of the original value. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:18:05
It was quite interesting watching the price disparity between USD, EUR and GBP yesterday as they all approached their respective walls.

You have to claim your bitcoin from the new chain, you'll need to google how to do that. However once you have, usually Bitfinex will list them for trading, you can send them there and trade for whatever you want.

Yes. Only buy what you can afford to lose. Use an app like Coinbase. Use 2FA.
Don't panic-sell. Don't fret about short-term dips. If in doubt, zoom out. Cryptocurrencies are going to change the world and they haven't even started yet. Don't be the guy that sold his oil field for the price of a new car.

Over 100 BTC in sell orders on GDAX at 10,000 EUR. It looks like a wall on the depth chart. The price can't rise above there until all those orders are filled.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:44:49
Futures don't encourage anyone to purchase bitcoins, quite the opposite in fact. Traders can now trade with each other on the price of bitcoin without having to hold any.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:43:35
It means you get free Super Bitcoin. You could claim them and sell them for Bitcoin, which has been the smartest thing to do so far for all the other hard forks.

The €9999 wall is being eaten up.

It's brutal. Reckon there will be another dip?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:02:30
No, the splits happen because people want to make backwards-incompatible upgrades to the currency. Make it faster, or more secure, more private, use less energy, whatever. The purpose of Bitcoin is to be useful as a currency (or whatever let's not get into that), and it's possible that these upgrades result in a new type of Bitcoin that, through being superior, overtakes and replaces the previous type. Never has done before, but one day it might.
The trading is just a side-effect of all that.
(That said, cynically, you could argue that the only reason people fork Bitcoin is that they can make a quick buck off it).

Also it is easier to get an accurate and unadulterated display with a monitor. TVs are configured to make them "pop" - amp up the colour, contrast, blacken the blacks. This reduces their suitability as PC displays.
It's not impossible to make a TV behave like a neutral display, but it is harder.
For reference the input lag of a 55" 4k Samsung TV ranges from 20ms to 48ms, compared to 10ms or less for a gaming monitor. At 60hz (the rate at which almost all fighting games run at), 48ms is up to 3 whole frames! That's a big deal.

Yeah man. So stupid it hurts. I sent some BTC to Bitfinex so I could trade to some BCH during the wobble. Luckily Coinbase took 24hr to send out the transaction and by the time I had the funds BCH was dead again.
Paying $40 to send it back was painful, but it could have been a lot worse.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:17:50
This. Bitcoin is less useful to your average Redditor, but there are many people using Bitcoin in places where their geopolitical environment makes transactions possible that were not before.
There are also a class of legitimate use-cases where a higher degree of anonymity* in the transaction is desired. For example, paying for VPNs.

He's not a criminal. He's a lawyer who is executing the bankruptcy of Mt Gox. He's selling these coins to pay back all the people who had money or coins in Mt Gox.
I think it's stupid that he's selling at such low prices, but after he has raised the dollar-amount owed to the creditors, the remaining coins go back to the owner of Mt Gox. That's just the law. That's the real travesty, so the less he sells them for, and the less left over there are, the better. In my opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:16:02
Two observations: 
1. After the spamming began a large number of the blocks mined are not full. Would indicate collusion with the largest mining pools, which it was said was the reason why spamming the blockchain wasn't cripplingly expensive last time.
2. Mass-cancellation of 12sat/b - 40sat/b transactions, leaving the 40+ ones in place, establishing a new floor.
Looks like mass-spamming and mempool manipulation to me.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:13:46
There is a thing called "difficulty adjustment", which is built-in to the Bitcoin protocol. It makes mining more difficult as more hashrate comes online, to prevent it from being too easy (profitable) to mine  a block. However, I think it adjusts every few weeks, so while $5k might be a near-term floor for profitability, the floor would drop as hashrate goes offline.
Also, Bitcoin can absolutely go down to any value and regardless of the profitability of mining. It just means that below a certain point the network stops working.
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:19:33
That's a shame. If the exchanges were regulated we would have more protection from pump/dump schemes, wash trading, and all the other abnormal price behaviour you see on Bitcoin. Without a stable valuation Bitcoin will struggle to get wide adoption. Regulation of Bitcoin itself is bad, but the exchange between fiat and Bitcoin needs more oversight.
Maybe this is how the US tries to kill it.

Typically you can sell maintenance and support contracts to your users. Some businesses might take sponsorship to develop specific features. You can also charge for providing your software as a service, e.g. free to download and install or pay $5/m for us to host it for you.

1. Download the Coinbase app.
2. Buy some Bitcoin using the app.
Now you have Bitcoins, you can send them:
1. Go to Accounts
2. Tap BTC Wallet
3. Tap the paper aeroplane icon in the top right (which indicates "send").
4. Enter an amount in BTC or fiat, tap next.
5. Tap the QR code icon to scan an address.
6. Done
There are more convenient apps for the payment portion (I use GreenBits), but you have to send your Bitcoins from Coinbase (using the method above) to your GreenBits wallet.
