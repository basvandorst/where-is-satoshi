The only problem is, how do you know you’re reciting the correct words? I believe you can memorize pages at a time no problem, but with something as sensitive as this, you could be remembering one word wrong and then the entire seed is wrong. And you’ve been reinforcing the wrong word all along so the correct one is gone.

Can you explain how you would redeem your coins? Say you sent BTC to a BCH address, are you saying the person on the other side of that BCH address can redeem your coins?

Funny enough, it’s a bank building. Corporate offices, banks employees, lawyers etc.

Thank you. I'm also sick of these articles. I REALLY hope Bitcoin goes to $50k but who the hell actually knows? If someone tells you they know where it should be, ask them to share their valuation models, etc. NO one actually knows how to value Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies like it.

LOL IS THIS FOR REAL... 
Direct quote: "I decided to write this article to point the real reasons why btc is dropping. Newbies who believe this is because of fb ads – chinese new year – wallstreet – manipulation, this is just stupid, and if you really belive in those, then u’re an idiot. “crypto is prohibited on fb ads” – yeah, same as penises. Did the penises dropped? I strongly doubt."

I don’t get the point of this. You really shouldn’t use the same address more than once unless you’re asking for donations or charity and you want to stick to a static address.

That being said the card is beautiful. Well done.

Interestingly, the website he advertises, Goldmoney, actually helps you buy and store crypto:

Thank you. I agree this is completely unwarranted, immature and just plain rude.
