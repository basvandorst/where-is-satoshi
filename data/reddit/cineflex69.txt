Best part of this year is the whole "buying shares of the block chain" meme. Couldn't read it without laughing.

If the price of Bitcoin were to be displayed as its mBTC dollar amount, we'd probably see people getting into it more as it'll look cheaper. Say, $1 per mBTC. Pretty reasonable price from that perspective, whereas full BTC will be at $1000 at that point. It'll help newcomers get over that expensive psychological hurdle. 
I do however disagree with eliminating the ability to display as BTC. Don't really see the point in that.

Would you recommend a Trezor? I've been looking into it recently considering how the price is going up and I'm worried about leaving my btc on an exchange.

Do you think that the ability of Bitcoin to be divisible by ever increasing number of decimal places will help stave off deflation? Like say, .001 BTC in year A will be equivalent to .0001 BTC in year B. Less is worth more, so even if some have way more BTC than others, the rate of exchange can be adjusted to compensate.

Aw crap I was trying to reply to the other guy who responded to my comment lol. I asked him what he thinks about Trezor hardware wallet and he said it was good. The new Reddit mobile app kind of sucks for that. 
Getting to your topic ... Idk what all the hate is about. I've purchased all my coins thru coin base and never had a problem. It may take a little while to get my coins once the purchase goes through, but everything is insured so I like the peace of mind. 
Haven't tried there exchange yet though so I can't help you there.

How does this change tip thing work? I've been seeing it for years but I have no idea how to tip or how to accept them.

Wouldn't that be nice? I rounded up to another Bitcoin at around $480. I'm still up overall, but ouch if that immediate drop didn't make me shake my head. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:30:31
I think it'll only exacerbate the problem.

Would you recommend the book? I'm looking to pick up one on Amazon and I can't decide which book to get. I'm looking for something that goes a little deeper than laymen's terms but isn't dull

I use coin base but I have a wait period. If it matters, I buy from my phone on the app.

Underrated comment right here.

I enjoyed reading your thought process. I actually did the same calculation today (population divided by btc supply.) However, I think it's important to recognize that it's more realistic that Bitcoin will exist as an aside to government fiat notes akin to how a green back in the 50's could be redeemable for gold/silver etc. 
I imagine paper bitcoin wallets w/ qr codes that contain bits with which an individual could redeem to their wallet or spend by hand. Kind of maintains the anonymity aspect of cash but w/ actual value attached.

Interesting video. The host seemed pretty surprised to learn about the free, cross border transactions. Thanks for posting.

I've been following Bitcoin since 2013 but only recently (July) decided to buy some. So, I know about the fluctuations. I was just expressing my disappointment in buying at the top of the most recent spike. 
Live and learn lol.

Coinbase is showing $308.57 for me. I don't know if the app shows things faster or slower than other sites, but that's how I'm checking it. 
Increase of $12.00 in the past 24 hours. Pretty cool.
