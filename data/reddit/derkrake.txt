Interesting write-up.
Sidenote: In a few decades, social scientists may be quite happy about this early participant observation.

Makes sense to spread it then.

You may be an idiot, but that likely is an unrelated issue to you owning 0.1 bitcoins. Now: no one can predict the future, even with all their financial charts and economic divination. Just sit back and watch it grow. Worst case it gets wiped out, but then you've only lost a dinner at a restaurant and gained insight into investment and the possible future of money.

It currently seems most people are selling digital services (programming, design, copywriting etc.) and luxury items. I would like to see more farmers (e.g. at farmers market), plumbers, carpenters and other qualified tradesmen provide the option of purchasing their work with bitcoins.
Edit: Look at it this way. It is very common for proponents of bitcoin and critics of current economic policies in most industrialized nations to complain about speculation or how all the real economy has been outsourced or how we've turned into service-based nations. If you agree with the latter points and are buying into bitcoin for speculation, how are you not a hypocrite? Why are you not just another speculator trying to siphon off gains (leading to the atrophy of the real economy)?

Which is also an excellent reminder about denominations: you don't have to think in bitcoin-sized units--think in decimals (here: mbit). 
Compare with the values of $, €, £, which are the reference points for a great deal of the world's transactions. It will be so in bitcoins too if it takes off for everyday transactions.

"Don't make mindbets, you'll lose your..." Well, I forgot the rest because I'm busy gnawing my face off with regret for not buying thousands of Bitcoins in 2009.
