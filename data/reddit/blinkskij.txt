Definitely in... I'm working the night shift tonight. 
Also,  I'm handing out candy to bar patrons. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 09:26:01
Oh. I don't know what that is, sorry.  
I'll just see myself out.

Save them for the day when 1BTC is worth a million?
I've only got a miniscule amount myself. Although I'm not quite sure if I still have access to them.

oh, if only. What a wonderful world it could be :)

You don't need to invent something to patent it. 
 Just look at Edison who patented other people's stuff.  
And for a more contemporary example, there's Apple and the magnetic power plug. Not their invention. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 10:44:28
Also, not patenting them would allow others to patent the parts, which would be like making an axe then handing it to your executioner. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:17:24
See, if you were right, then Apple wouldn't hold a [patent on magnetic power cords]( because that existed for decades prior to Apple patenting it.

Makes it real easy to pay for the dented body and broken lights when they inevitably collide

it's 
It plays notes based on transactions, where the pitch is decided by the transaction amount. Larger transactions get a deeper pitch.
If you're like me, it's pretty interesting for a little while, then when you realize it just sounds like really bad piano tinkering by someone who never learned to play. Then you put on some real music.

They also charge different amounts depending on where you live. A Norwegian spotify user pays 99NOK a month (about $17) for premium, while a US user pays $9.99.
I guess they could calculate different BTC invoices depending on the user's IP, just like they use the IP to decide what to charge now. But I don't think a company that uses shitty sales tactics like this is likely to listen to user input.
@_date: 2013-04-14 10:58:32
I can see it being useful for that. It just gets to be annoying for me, but I don't expect everyone to feel the same, of course :)
I really wonder how a transaction that big would sound.

I'd add that the encryption means that some people (i.e, those with shitty ISPs that throttle certain services) may experience an increase in speed, since the ISP has no way of discerning between types of traffic.
If you choose an end node in a privacy-friendly country, you.'ve just made your p2p life so much safer.
You can also use the vpn to watch online content that would otherwise be unavailable to you due to geographical limitations. Just switch the exit node to a suitable IP and consume content.
Like OP, I also bought a year of PIA vpn with BTC (and used a tormail address to sign up).
I'm as anonymous as I can be, apart from them knowing my real IP which I connect from (which they say they aren't logging).

or Norway?
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:57:39
I would love to. It'd be pretty nice to have a Norwegian btc exchange. Would make things a lot easier for my countrymen, and possibly also the other Nordic countries. But I possess neither the skills required, nor do I have funds to hire people who do.
And buying a solution like this doesn't seem like a good idea either, since I would be unable to ensure it is up to snuff.
I wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing I have people's money - perhaps even their life savings - in my hands while I really don't know what the fuck I'm doing. 
I guess I'm not enough of a sociopath to ever become rich by screwing over other people like that.

Also, they're backed by a name with serious political muscle
@_date: 2013-04-28 23:49:04
Well, the EU is a political entity much like a country government, so it still kinda follows the convention

+1 for Entropay. There are fees and stuff, but it's really helpful when you need around cc location restrictions.
@_date: 2013-04-14 05:01:41
Wonder what that sounded like...perhaps listentobitcoin found the "[brown note](

No joy for those of us living in EEC countries, but not EU?
