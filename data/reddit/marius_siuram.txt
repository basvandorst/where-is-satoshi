I believe that's wrong, I expect nowhere to have that messed up cardinal system. In some places the following may be correct:
two thousand one hundred billion

I am really interested in the "travelling aspects" of those debit cards. Most cards I have seen have some heavy limitations or fees on the "currency change", either by having the same fee as my fiat bank, or by locking the currency of the card. Maybe that is a limitation of the debit card mechanism itself.
My question is: what are the best providers for myself (EUR resident) if I want to travel to (mainly) GBP and USD countries. Is a bitcoin debit card a good choice for this scenario?

(genuine question) Could you name a few, please? I have stumbled with a lot of 2.5% - 3% currency change fee...

You know what is NOT yet mainstream?

No it's not. If someone steals your bitcoin wallet keys, that someone can obtain all the bitcoins in it. If someone steal a check book, the money in the bank is (should be) safe.

I have (obviously) seen this project. But I don't like it. The approach is similar to having a smart card for payments, and I am looking more on the "safe-in-the-wall" approach. Using an USB for offline transaction doesn't seem quite right --not what I have in mind, not what I find comfortable.
Edit: bitcoin-qt node? I am speaking about a cold storage hardware wallet, no X and no network connection!

a touchscreen easy to adapt? Well, I beg to differ. But I have never used one / programmed for it. I have used a LCD and that is indeed [easy to plug]( But well, not yet an old dog, I might be a bit eager to test new things. Your experience? Any model / reseller which might be worth looking at?
At first I thought a bit on the touchscreen and big screen (QR codes for the address, and things like that). But after thinking a bit about that, it didn't seem so easy and comfortable.


yeah, I definitely agree. But it is quite cheap, easy to find, and there is so much community around it. If someone wants to build a PCB from scratch, I think they are doing a great job. But Bitcoin community is not so big: demand is expected to be low.
I have bad experiences with "mini linux computers". Raspberry Pi has never let me down. I may change opinions, but first I have to try the hardware and pay a lot less for it.

Technically, it is closer (while following your analogy) to state the comparison as going from $3/hr to $6/hr and going from 5c/min to 10c/min.
