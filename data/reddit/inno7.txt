Instructions if you are a newbie to bitcoin
1. The dog is highly speculative. It is currently experimental, so I will suggest averaging how much you put into the dog over time.
2. Avoid groupthink. People tend to invest in dogs closer to christmas (clothing, etc) and summer (vacations) and then make their dogs work for them closer to new year (resolutions, running etc). Do not follow the crowd, but use your own intuition.
3. Only put into the dog what you are prepared to lose.
4. Get an offline kennel and *never*, I repeat, **never** give the dog to anyone. That is like handing the keys to your house to a stranger.
5. Digging for food is not very profitable these days, most of the shovel pools are now in China. Just buy them off a reputed exchange like [Caninebase.com](
6. Last but not the least, never trust any links from any one.
edit - You were talking of dog, the animal?

I bought a low end Nokia phone recently. It has two SIM slots, a headphone jack and lasts three days. I dropped it twice and it has a small nick on the side cover.
They make it out of Valyrian steel and Dragon Glass.
