I paid 7btc for a vibrator many years ago. It was crap.

I’m just saying it’s an effective enema solution. Storebought enema kits are a sham.

It wasn’t an anal vibrator

I would have been more than satisfied with a Nissan Cube

Would you like a boiled sweet, dear? \*hands you one of those weird strawberry candies\*

Don’t feel bad... 
When bitcoin was still new, an early-adopter friend gave me 25BTC. I spent 24.997 of that on a single dildo

Nah. We dated a while and then broke it off anyway lmao

I remember ye olde BTC faucets. I found one where I could get 25 BTC per day (that’s how long ago it was) but my friend who had gotten me into crypto said it was a waste of time since I was HODLing and not trying to sell for profit 
Fuck you, James

Let’s kill James

Zoomed in with brightness up it does look like the wheel is inside the line, but the shadow of the mud flap makes it look like it’s out further

Ugh, my James did that too
