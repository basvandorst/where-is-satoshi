That's ridiculous! Is there a list of sites? I've just switched to Sky Broadband. Although I've not noticed any problems yet.

Heads up - Avast is flagging this as malware.

And Code Complete for the bigger picture/language agnostic stuff.

I'll be happy to sell to you via OKPay on localbitcoins.com if you have or can get an account. My adverts are here and I can take payment in USD, EUR or GBP. 
There's an autoresponder set up on there so as soon as the correct payment hits my OKPay wallet, you get the coins instantly. No waiting around for me to see the transaction.

If you're looking to deactivate when the price drops below what you'll take you can add that as one of the max() parameters, so for example max(max(mtgoxUSD,cbxUSD)*1.06),100) - edited, thanks to

The worst bit is he admitted as much - I thought it was in the Forbes interview but couldn't find it on a quick scan. I read somewhere that he said that someone had tracked him down before so it could be done again.

+1 if sarcasm

I just did exactly this. Admittedly it's lost potential gains but this is inherently a risky game and worth avoiding the risk of losses. I'm already up by 5x so not worried at all!

It is a good question. Chapter and verse seems to be " A user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations."

I see you've probably found someone already but if not we'd be happy to take a look at any minor changes you need making (for free if they're minor and you're happy for them to be included in future versions of the software). You'd think we'd probably be your best option!

How about setting up an IFTTT that forward tweets from one of the many twitter BTC price bots to your parents email?

I almost exclusively use Bitstamp. Also positive is that the API is stable, well documented, and doesn't keep changing. However they still also get swamped when the market goes nuts like yesterday.

This is the best explanation of the pricing formulae I've seen. Great stuff. And I couldn't agree more on the need for Local Bitcoins as a (much) simpler way of getting your first bitcoins. I wish I'd found it before nervously wiring my money to Japan back in the heady days of last October!

You can cash out on LocalBitcoins and take advantage of the 10% - 15% premium mentioned above. If you set a low premium then you'll normally find a buyer pretty quickly.

Sounds like the "fruity gold" analogy which I can't quite remember.

Looks strangely familiar from watching bitcoinity over the last half a week or so.

Not so good at the information density though. Has anyone ranked different media on how long you can expect to store a given amount of information in it? Like MB.years/m3 or MB.years/kg.
