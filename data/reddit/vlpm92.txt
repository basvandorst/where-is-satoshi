Upon the 218th replay, I think the little girl taking cover by the portajohns runs away when the second one sprays all over them.  The GIF that keeps on giving

I don't have any witty comment to make, just wanted to let it be known that I have been sitting here laughing like an idiot for 10 minutes.  Thank you for this

You may want to diversify a small portion of that into IOTA. Just in case

Not. She’s not ugly, but hot is reserved for well above average

Serious response, I’m a huge believer in BTC but if you aren’t able to understand this then I don’t think you’re ready to buy yet. Not trying to put you down, but if you’re not educated well about what you’re investing in, you’re going to get burnt. 
For this question, just understand that it works just like a stock. Stocks have prices in dollars, BTC has price in dollars. Your BTC amount (.002 BTC) doesn’t change unless you buy or sell some. What it’s worth in dollars does change.
I recommend you first start reading about how the stock market works and get a base understanding of that. After that, try to understand what makes bitcoin special by reading about how it works and watching videos from Andreas Antonopolous. You’ll have a lot of questions because it’s complicated. Feel free to ask this sub if you don’t get something, that’s what it’s here for.

I was scared when I switched phones today too, had to manually log in and rescan QR with new phone (kept old phone to log in with)
My question is how do i backup my google authenticator app? The app is so barren and has no info or options in it whatsoever

I was going to say it'd look better visually if instead of cutting the fiat to make the logo they just put a nice, shiny white plastic logo popping out on top of the fiat.  But your comment may have changed my mind on that

So it’s just pure maths and hashing functions that validate a private key correlates to a pub key and such? And how does it save the value to an address if said address isn’t in the blockchain?  I feel like this must be a semantics thing between “the blockchain” and Bitcoin

The body of your post could have been one word: HODL

How progressive of you. Oh it’s totally ok tho because he has wrongthink disease.

Bruh. What? The blockchain is the engine and the anchor for security but by itself it will never be practical for everyday payments.  People can't sit around and wait 10 minutes for their transaction to be added to the blockchain and then oh wait another 30 minutes just to make sure it's fully confirmed before you leave the store.

Thank you, thought of it myself

Bitcoin has physical properties too.  They are etched onto hardrives around the world.  
"You can't do anything unique with bitcoin"   It is programmable money the likes of which the world has never seen.  You can do damn near anything with it especially in the future when there's support for smart contracts.  
Also in regards to that comment, what can you do with gold that is so unique?  Melt it and mold it? Oooooh, ahhhhh
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:17:23
I disagree.  If you "copy and improve it" then that's on a different chain that has to redo all the work bitcoin has already done for network effects over the last 10 years.  The supply is finite, just like gold.  There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin and those bitcoin will forever live on hardrives getting passed between owners.
No different than gold forever living under beds and buried in backyards and around necks getting passed between owners.

Well, OP is Jimmy Song, who has done more for BTC than everyone in this thread will do in their lifetimes combined, so I'd say maybe refute his statement with points of your own instead of blindly calling people morons.

Yeah, I mean it would be a super valuable service that would be worth the fees for business owners and for helping grow the ecosystem, but it just *feels* dirty.  Like reintroducing mastercard and visa on BTC network.  
Satoshi paid the sacrifice by open sourcing his software and giving it to the world for free and anonymously.  But there was no way he could've known or felt highly confident it would ACTUALLY become what it is today.  It would be much harder for another person or group to open source and give away great software with so much potential profit at their fingertips.

In this thread: people mistaking stability of software for stability of price.  FTFY

I certainly DONT want payment processors.  That's why I'm saying this is an issue, because it would disrupt the entire peer to peer nature as I said.  But you can't deny that a kickass app like that would make it so much easier to spread adoption to small businesses and individuals by bringing ease of use to the whole thing.  Like an operating system did for computers.
The question is, how do we get there organically?  Or what will it look like to get to that "OS-like" ease of use for everyday people who can't grasp the slightest bit of tech?
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:37:57
That's true, it's up to all of us to rally against those kind of middle men trying to leak into the system.

How does it compromise security?

If people move away, there's less total hashpower and miners that stay in now have a higher percentage of total hashpower, so they're more likely to get the block rewards.
Also, with less miners/hashpower, the difficulty will adjust downwards further increasing the effectiveness of rigs that stay online.
