I've always been told only gamble 12% of what you have, but maybe start off with a little until you know how to store it safely. You don't own any Bitcoin unless you own the keys. And only buy what you can afford to lose ��

We will be doomed as they would abolish cash eventually then charge us a percentage to own it just like the banks are trying to charge us for having cash in the bank. At the moment you can take cash out and store it at home but with digital money they can do as that please.... Bitcoin all the way

Make a paper wallet with a password send a minimum amount then use a mobile wallet like breadwallet to import keys then make a new paper wallet with a password and send funds to that.

Bitttylicious I use them all the time. The others are a joke. You get your bitcoins virtually instantly. It's not the cheapest but very trustworthy. Highly recommended until something better comes along

Yes I definitely am. I check the price daily but don't know why because I won't sell even if the price sinks to a penny and get excited when the price boosts way up. I read all the story's and news and even all the weird comments and bs story's. I'm a firm believer and think this block size should be sorted
@_date: 2016-07-18 11:50:07
It's never too late to take your first step. Yes there was those earlier believers but take your first steps and look back in a year or two and be glad you did it ��

On bread wallet hit top left button then go down to import private key and scan the code, simples. If it's password protected then enter password and everything's all good
