In 2011 we crashed from 30 to 3.
In 2014 we crashed from 1000 to 200.
In 2018 we will crash from 20000 to 4000?
Currently bitcoin is **totally unusable** with these fees and tx times.
Don't you think it's time for another 80% crash?

I think it will drop lower.
Why? - Because there was no reason for it to climb this high especially considering the tech is broken right now and Bitcoin can't even be actually used as currency!
Just [look]( @ the 2014 crash, you can see we recovered from some dips only to dip lower. True, I don't know if the bobble has burst yet (or are we just in another small 30% dip) but I think it's time for another 80% crash. We haven't had one since the 1000 to 200 crash.

True. I just don't know if they'll be able to do it in time.
At one space MySpace was the KING of social networks, it WAS social networks but then Facebook came and destroyed it. I can't help but wonder if the same thing will happen to Bitcoin.

Basically I think you are right. In the context of bitcoin I meant "destroyed" in the sense of "unpopular" as you wrote.

Nah. Putting the days first has a good reason: usually it's the part you're most interested in. So when you read the date why should you see the year first? You probably know what year is it.
I think year first only makes sense because we want the computer to easily sort dates :) Yeah, that would be great. For computers year first makes sense. But for actually reading the date... less so.

I'd think the reason there's no more adoption is because the product is pretty much useless as this stage. (not exactly useless but 15$-30$ fees are a joke.)
We can't even handle the current amounts of transactions, and you think the problem is we're lacking adoption..?

It's amusing that it seemed to required the usually-annoying device confirmation when you logged in, but not when the hacker logged in.

RemindMe! 3 weeks "bear trap or bull trap?"

Quality response, cheers.

Not bad, I think it would be better with a different punctuation:
Bitcoin, rise or fall
Icarus or Phoenix, which
Is the bottom in?

Good post mate. This point reminds me of Silicon Valley, anybody watches it?
The part where they launch the platform and it sucks and they obviously need a UE guy/team. But the company doesn't even recognize or think about it. That oversight looked kinda ridiculous but now with Bitcoin's example I see it's not so far fetched...
On a similar note, some days ago I read in how some team that tried to sign Durant told him all the details of their defensive plans to stop GSW... and in the end Durant went to GSW. So now Durant\GSW know all the first team's ideas for defense. Reminded me of that Endframe bit, where the PP guys told them half their algorithm like knucklejobs... Well, looks like -that- wasn't that far fetched either.
