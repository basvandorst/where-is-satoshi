Did this already, &lt;3 segwit

You start at 0.01 btc per trade and work your way up with successful trades, so not right away but if someone can sell/buy a lot, they generally can be trusted.

Hmm if you have a trusted drug dealer ask him, or maybe someone in his supply chain knows someone. Other than that, no clue. Meet-Ups maybe? Conferences?

Not the value just the price has dropped, those are very different things

Best thing is to reply: "Still up 600% from initial investment." And watch them process it.

Can you please elaborate which service Coinbase is providing that you couldn´t set up yourself in 30mins with knowing how to google?
@_date: 2019-03-31 07:11:46
Yes quite well actually. For further Infos visit r/bisq or read their FAQ. I have made only positive experiences with the platform.

Localbitcoins or a similar cash-based bitcoin transaction on a private level are my preferred way to sell my fiat. Those olden days Bitcoin meetups do still exist, and you can still trade cash if you want. I for myself do happily sell and buy on those occasions. 
Unfortunately Coinbase seems to take the cake in usability and adoption, but in my sense they don´t provide a real service to the costumer. (My knowledge level about CB is that you don´t own your private keys and pretty much just store it at a wallet they ultimately control "Proof of Keys" was last month iirc, didn´t really follow up on that also never used CB so my opinion of them is more anecdotal than from own expierence.) 
Also running your own node does provide you with the ability to confirm the transactions yourself. By that I mean if you see it on your node that is connected to the BTC network you are 100% sure it went trough, and don´t have to trust a third party block explorer.

And that is something that should scare us and make the castration of coinbases amassed power even more urgent.

The only way BTC is exiting my portfolio is in exchange for goods and services. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 15:18:27
Sadly you are right, but if we can do something about it, even on a private level, why not. Just order that premade node of the net or build one yourself for under 50$ and be your own coinbase and confirm your own transactions. 
But yeah realistically 20-30years before we see a real switch.

In my opinion it won´t be Bitcoin that we are using in daily life, at least not on-chain transaction. I imagine a future with side chains or stuff like the lightning network etc. and on-chain transaction happen in bulk by retailers. Bitcoin will function like the clearinghouses do today.

One day it will, not because BTC is worth so much, rather that Fiat will be worth next to nothing.

Just a normal day in Bitcoinville, all the weak hands are fleeing... good for us.
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:26:09
It will be like a magnet, but the Central Banksters will run the printing presses hot and devaluate their precious magic fiat money to infinity. With this perfect storm we really don´t know what the price will be adjusted to a worldwide hyperinflation.... But yeah we will see but I firmly believe the future will be grand.

Just Go to a Crypto/Bitcoin Meetup near you. There will be people willing to sell.

You must be one of those people who got in last December, for OGs which are still up 3x (just talking about last 12 Months) or 10x+ (pick a date) it's still the best ROI... If you could be so kind and tell me wich other assets tripled their value in the last 12 Months, feel free to share them
