I found the exact same coins in the app „wish“.
Cheap stuff from china, but tbh those at this website for $2.50 can’t be any better ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

He should have bought as many as he could have

Well he was right...

I think every withdrawal fee is higher than .61€.... that might be the reason

I think you should only start mining if you don't have do pay for power... mining often just pays the powerbills it creates

Yeah the one star ratings were probably from that time peroid in which the app crashed permanently.
That was a bug about 2-4 weeks ago, but they fixed it by now. I guess i would approve bitstamp and their app

Using that one since 2017, geman as well.
Works fine ����

I tried that for a while... you know, buy low - sell high - buy low... in the end i actually bought high - sold low - bought high
You either get lucky, or you dont
As long as you are not a pro, just someone with a little bit of spare money you want to invest and get some higher interest than from any bank: buy and hodl → ‚no‘ risk, but more money
Not SUPER much more money, but not super much LESS money neither

I like bitstamp alot
0.25% trading fee, but getting smaller the more you trade a month
Good for euro

Fellow Deutscher hier...
Also ich machs ganz einfach:
Ich mach mir ein paper-wallet, da kommen alle meine Bitcoins drauf bis nach dem fork, DANN gucke ich welche Wallet BTG unterstützt und tausche meine BTG für BTC
Für paper-wallet 
Seite auf Desktop speichern, Internetverbindung kappen, paper-wallet erstellen, profit

I really think you should not do that.. it‘s absolutely NOT a good plan, it‘s a BAD plan.
2 people told you already in this thread, you still chose to listen to the ONE that‘s more the answer you want it to be.
You should probably talk to your parents instead of some random people in the internet.
Do NOT just run away from your „problems“; 2000$ sounds like a lot now, but it‘s really not. Once you have a job you‘ll probably make something like that in a month

2000€? Probably within the next 10 minutes.
2000$? Maybe tomorrow ornthe day after tomorrow.
But I think the price will raise again towards sunday evening / monday

But you need to transfer some money a few days in advance as well... don't know if that's helping you ��
