But, Coinbase isnt buying it themselves. If you sell bitcoin on Coinbase, it means someone else is buying bitcoin on Coinbase with fiat they are giving to Coinbase, that they give to the seller. It will crash the price, yes. But how would they ever run out of funds?

No. I don't think thats right at all. When you sell a bitcoin on Coinbase that means someone on Coinbase is buying it at that price. Thats the only way a sell order goes through. Coinbase isnt buying it themselves, they arent using corporate funds.
Coinbase is receiving that fiat from the buyer &amp; giving it to the seller. The funds have already been received by the bitcoin buyers account &amp; are sitting on coinbase in a separate insured FDIC account.  Its merely a middle man taking a percentage of the sale.

Got ya, thanks for clarifying. They are closer in that category but most sources still have Japan &amp; France higher for example:
Do you have a different source that says otherwise?

In what way is the US stock Market smaller? The two top companies alone have a bigger market cap then all crypto.

Dude, I'm on this Reddit so I like Bitcoin. It might be a great decision. But it might be a bad one. Doing that is just so, so risky. You shouldn't do that. Diversify. Even in a 401k you hold bonds. Shits getting out of control here.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:22:46
Wtf are you taking about?? Japan has the 3rd highest Gdp followed by France at  Israel is down in the 30s. That noone else here questioned such a clearly ridiculous statement is concerning

Although I think it is a scam, but I could see a legit business case. There's a chance it could fall, you rent a certain rate, they profit either way, yes its less if the price rises, but more if it falls.
But still, it's a scam.

It needs more. I think you can rationally believe in Bitcoin and it's future, while simultaneously looking at this objectively and realizing it's a bubble. The gains it has experienced recently can't rationally be explained. It might really be worth this much. I don't know, nobody knows. But there is a limit to how much, and how fast things can rise without consequences

I don't think you even know how Wikipedia works. If you see things you feel are biased go try and fix them. Of course it will have to be well researched and sourced, and looks like you have a really strong bias yourself. But its not as if it's one large group who somehow gets together and supports NATO editing every page. I edit alot of pages, and if so, I slept in for that indoctrination conference call. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:56:41
Bias-prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair.
I'm aware of what it means. I was saying you are biased towards NATO.
You dumb fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:03:23
Why would someone purposely invest in something they see as a speculative bubble? That would be illogical as fuck. This is not a great insight. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:34:12
Why? Honestly. I believe in Bitcoin. But come on, you will never sell, or use it, just keep pumping in more money? You are helping make other people wealthy that way. But seems like if you never plan to sell.. Well wtf. You could buy cool things for yourself or your family, give to charity...do alot better things with your money. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:50:36
No. But it is Biased. Either way there is absolutely no moral equivalency between NATO &amp; Nazis. 
The point is encyclopedias need to stay unbiased as possible. Where you seem to have an active bias against NATO whatever that is. You are free to pursue that issue. But Wikipedia is not the correct platform for your political views.

Joking or stupid?

Not with something like Monero. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:28:15
I'm not comparing the two. Gold has been used a a currency for thousands of years, serves as a modern day hedge against financial down turns, and has real world industrial uses.
Bitcoin fails at pretty much any use. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:21:02
Bitpay is just turning your bitcoin into dollars and allowing you to pay the gas station with that on a creditcard. No major gas chains take bitcoin. 
And you can do the exact same thing with Gold: 
Both of those ideas are stupid. But it can be done.
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:42:46
He just called it a store of value, not a currency.
Either way....you can't buy gas with bitcoin either.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:28:50
Exactly, a banana has some real life utility if you can't sell it. You can still eat it. But a bitcoin you can't sell is just a useless bunch of bits. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:54:51
You see all these people calling you retarded? You are completely wrong on every factual point. Supply and demand absolutely works the same for bitcoin and stocks. Im not trying to be mean. But you honestly are totally confused on how things work. Read an economics book, take a college course. But keep learning. Because right now you are making a fool of yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:56:36
It's a number he made up. There's no way to really determine it's value based on that, but if you could if it's value were to be purely based on current use as a currency, it would be much, much below that...
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:02:22
You really are wrong though. An oil change is a completely worthless analogy for a financial bubble where the example he gave of housing it perfect. 
Financial bubble-An economic bubble or assetbubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, afinancial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value.
That sounds exactly like what's going on in crypto currency now. It has nothing to do with hitting 0. You dont understand the term.
