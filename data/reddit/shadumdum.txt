If I don't use coinbase, what's the best way to get my B2X?
@_date: 2013-03-05 04:36:51
This is amazing to see. I'm so glad that there are people in the community who do things like this. I hope that some of the organizations begin to see that bitcoin is worth accepting!
I sent $100 to water.org. I hope I see other donations to them! 
What is the best way to send proof? I can take screenshots..

Wait, are you serious? I haven't checked my wallet yet this morning, but holy batman, that's awesome! Thank you so much proudhon. You really didn't have to. 
And while I have you, what is bitcointalk? 
@_date: 2013-03-18 21:22:10
There are lots of different ways. You can go to some places and make cash deposits. I know that mt. gox allows you to do that. With the transition of mt. gox and coinlab, US customers will soon be able to get money there much easier.
I have always used coinbase. There is usually a smaller fee, and you are allowed to go directly through your bank account, but it can take like a week for your coins to come. For me it worked perfectly, but some people are like "they're my coins, and I need them now!".

These are awesome! Now I don't have to have bitcoinity open all the time.
I do wish that they were a little easier to read. Maybe you could up the font size a little bit? You should also add an option to allow us to set how often it updates, or even where the updates are coming from. I know that this is a 1.0, but just things you could do for the future :)

BRING THIS TO THE TOP!
Everyone needs to know about this. Someone should start a post over at bitcointalk.org. I will if it needs to be out there.
We need to start a petition to give to amazon. We need to slowly start sending emails. 
Anyone know someone who works at Amazon? It's all about communicating the idea!
We are starting to have 5000+ people logged in at once, and more subscribers all day long. We can do this people.

Love this idea! How is this different than handbrake though? 
@_date: 2013-03-20 04:10:05
so buy now? Will it dip below 60 again? I'd be okay with that at this point I think...
@_date: 2013-02-15 19:09:16
How does this work? How is your reddit name associated with your wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-01 04:50:28
The size of the transaction should correlate with the noise. Smaller transactions being higher pitch, and the bigger ones being a lower pitch. 
There should also be a way to see buy/sell orders, and not just transactions. A high pitch for a buy, and low for a sell, or something. This is something that is awesome though :)

@_date: 2013-04-10 01:35:56
I didn't make a huge stink and I was helped very quickly. If you are polite and understanding, things can get done. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 20:17:44
I agree with you. I did one the other day, well because I have never actually heard of a bitcoin and I wanted to share my excitement. I am now finding out that people just do that all the time. Mine seemed to take off more than most peoples, but it's not like I got anything substantial from it. I just wanted to say hi to the community :)  But I can definitely see how it's going to get very obnoxious. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:06:45
Where did you move them too? I've had coins sitting in there for a long time, and I think it's about time to move them...I just have no clue how. 
@_date: 2013-02-23 21:29:18
I don't think me emailing coinbase and saying "someone said they sent me a bitcoin from your site to a wallet that is not on your site. Where is the bitcoin?" is going to help. haha

So so useful. I always like to give a little history when explaining it, and not being able to show the bubble pop in March made things no fun. 
I do find it interesting that mt. gox's yellow line in march doesn't go above 200 (barely above 150), and bitstamps goes pretty close to 250.

Are you saying the price is going to cut in half in just a month? 
@_date: 2013-03-08 08:07:13
Money on the go isn't really something that is important to me at this point, because I don't spend any bitcoin in my 'real life'.
On the chart that I linked in the op, it says that the security is minimal for Electrum. Does this mean that it doesn't have as good of security as something like bitcoin-QT? 
And thanks for that link! The original table just must not be completely up to date.

So for a main movie only, what is the approximate size of the burn. Am I able to choose a file size? I've done about 200 movies with handbrake and I haven't had any issues, but I really like the look of this, and it seems to have more options. When I get on my computer I'm definitely gonna pick it up.

Go check out bitzino.com. They are a bitcoin only gambling website with 'provably fair' odds. The developer(s) is an awesome guy from the stuff I have seen and just a couple interactions with him. The site lets you set your subunit. By this I mean it can show in bitcoin, centibitcoin, millibitcoin, or microbitcoin. (฿, c฿, m฿ or μ฿). It is awesome having 100000 microbitcoins to gamble with. It just kinda feels like play money!

I have been very active over on the bitcointalk newbie support forum. I have had one of my issues completely resolved, and another is close to being done.
THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN. I promise. I have kept in contact with URSAY and he is a good guy. He is new but he is doing everything possible to make sure everyone gets help. 
There are people on the forum who are talking about filing a lawquit against them. This is something that will never go through, because bitinstant is a reputable company and they are well managed. They have been having some issues and their support system is not strong enough to handle the entire flow of requests that have been coming in, but they are working incredibly hard. I know URSAY has been online for most of the last couple of days
tl;dr if you are having an issue, nicely state this and give them the information that they need. Then just sit tight. Screaming "WHERE IS MY MONEY" doesn't help anyone and only makes the customer service reps feel bad. They are doing a great job, we should applaud that. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 01:47:21
Have you contacted support? Are they doing anything at this point yet? 
@_date: 2013-02-15 08:47:29
Definitely going to start doing this.

@_date: 2013-04-09 09:52:46
I wish there was like three sentences that someone could come up that would perfectly encapsulate the idea of a bitcoin. I will have bitcoinity or something up on my computer, and people will wonder what it is. I just feel like I can't explain it easily, which totally sucks. There is just too much to explain. What the hell a bitcoin is. What a wallet it. How the addresses work. What the blockchain is. How verification works. 
I know these things because I have spent hours reading about things, but how do I tell someone about it in like 20 seconds?
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:15:37
Have you posted in the newbie support forum? If you post all the information you might still be able to get on the 4/10 support list. They will then escalate you to a service rep who will complete it for you.

Coin base is good and has low fees, but they take like a week too be deposited. Some people have also experienced coin base rejecting the transaction. I have had three separate transactions through them, and they took the amount of time it said, but they went on without a hitch. 
@_date: 2013-02-22 04:26:19

I think they are just getting a little behind, and something bad happened and it's just piling up. It looks like they are getting a lot of people through on that forum, but he also said that people are contacted them on facebook too, so it might be awhile. I posted my queue ID and stuff like that, so hopefully they are able to help. 
What kind of information do they need to be able to help you?

How do did you put yours in cold storage? I've been wanting to move mine out of blockchain for awhile. I installed the bitcoin-QT client, and have downloaded my wallet (last night before servers were down.) but I don't really know where to go from here. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 19:39:59
so electrum is good enough you think? I don't have a whole lot of bitcoins, but enough where I don't want them sitting in blockchain anymore. Does electrum rely on a backup file on your computer? as pointed out, having a 'hybrid online' wallet seems like a good idea. I am very very good about keeping backups, but just an idea.
If I kept all my coins in electrum, and then had a usb with a backup on it locked away in my safe, would that be a pretty good way to effectively store them? I have seen people talk about completely offline storage, but I want a way to access them and see the coins (like electrum would allow me to. )

mtgox said that they didn't receive anything. They are just the final destination, they don't actually have anything to do with the transfer.
I did finally get an email back from bitinstant though! They didn't say what the problem was, but they said that instead of getting a coupon sent to my email, that the funds were directly deposited into my mtgox account. I don't know what my 'serious error' was, but at this point it doesn't really matter. I haven't had time to check my mtgox account yet, but I will soon to see if the funds are there.

I haven't visited coinbase in a long time. I bought my first few coins from them a long time ago. Their site has come an immensely long way, and it is incredibly well done. Coinbase definitely is looking to be one of the bigger names in bitcoin, and I think they're going to do a mighty fine job. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:10:48
This is so great. More and more of these tech places are starting to jump on board the bandwagon. It makes me giddy buying things with bitcoin. 
Some of these bigger places like tigerdirect and Newegg will start seeing this adoption and join. I can feel it.

I believe this, but I think litecoin is still very interesting. I put a little into it a long time ago and have used it to day trade when I have the urge. I mines some too so I just used them to play. 
Now it's starting to become some serious cash. I hate to say it, but my return on investment is incredibly higher on litecoin right now, but my majority is still in bitcoins. I don't think anything else will ever be needed.
