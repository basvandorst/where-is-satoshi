For sure. That 2-3% could be worth hundreds in 6 months. You need to do a bank transfer once you're in GDAX though. Hit deposit and link a bank account. Then wait another 7+ days for your funds to clear. And have to buy at $20k+...

Yes, buy through GDAX, not coinbase. GDAX will also cover the transaction fee when you withdraw to an address

Lightning Network has me pessimistic on LTC.

Question: I have a large transaction (over 2000 bytes) that I need to send. Based on the recommended fee right now, it would cost $120 in transaction fee. Any recommendation for handling such a large transaction size? It has 14 inputs. Does doing multiple transactions help save costs?

It's taken me over a week before (starting from date that the charge confirmed at bank account).

I think the protocol creates the puzzle for the miners to solve? And adjusts the difficulty level for 10 minutes (could be wrong on this)

Research GDAX. Your login/pw already has you activated already. GDAX will pay the transaction for any outgoing deposits into any address. It's great.

It's $10k withdrawal per day, I believe. You can sell btc for large amounts of USD, which GDAX will hold in your account. It will just take time to withdraw that USD into your bank acct. I don't think there's a limit for depositing bitcoin into GDAX.

Create an online bitcoin? What?
If you mean wallet, then yeah I wouldn't store a lot on a hot wallet.

Gdax is a lot more user friendly. You can buy or sell through the exchange, so it's not really peer to peer. But another peer is posting a buy order or sell order, which you can complete. Or you can post a buy/sell order and wait for someone else to pickup the order. I'm not sure if bittrex shows the buy/sell walls on a nice graph. But it's basically just a high volume of orders (buy or sell) concentrated around 1 price.

Yes. Search for how to use GDAX. It's the sister exchange for coinbase. Start using GDAX to avoid purchase fees AS WELL AS transaction fees. Depending on how much btc you own, you can go a step further from a wallet and use a paper wallet

Blows my mind

Hard to tell. Always best to do your own research and learn from reputable sources. I haven't bought any ltc myself because of LN
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:43:17
I think LTC is exposing a large influx of coinbase users. I'm bullish on it for the wrong reasons. Tread carefully
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:33
It's like 2-3% on coinbase IIRC. Completely unnecessary and purely for the convenience. I haven't bought/sold on coinbase since I learned.

what is going on with the confirmation times... today has been slooooooow

No chance
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:46:14
Ditto. I manually enter all the data. More work but I can calculate a better BTC/USD with the transaction fees included.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:05:34
Seriously... btc is not for day trading
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:08:02
Great question. I had been wondering the same

A new coin is created after the fork. You keep your existing bitcoin with no changes. And then you automatically receive that same value in bitcoin gold (or whatever they call it).
This is the same as the bitcoin cash fork which happened Aug 1. If you owned .2 bitcoin before Aug 1. Then afterwards, you have .2 bitcoin AND .2 bitcoin cash. Any bitcoin you buy after Aug 1 is just received as bitcoin. And you would need to trade for bitcoin cash if you wanted it after Aug 1.
So its kind of like a dividend... in that you're receiving something extra without sacrificing anything. And in that the price drives up after the dividend is announced.

Yeah, why are you selling...?
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:08:43
fees aren't based on transaction price, but on memory size. Miners want to fit as many transactions (with fees) on 1 block so the transaction size matters. Transactions to multiple addresses are larger in size than 1 to 1.
If a transaction doesn't get picked up by miners because of a low fee, you can create a new transaction to the same address with a higher fee and the miners will most likely combine them to mine at the same time.
Good questions.
