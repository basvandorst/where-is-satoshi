Segwit2 is like another fork as Bitcoin Diamond, another cash grab for promoters. We must play the same game as them. We have to focus on the big money trades. "I just received news, the developer of Hempcoin (THC) already planned to list newly forked tokens in Jan 2018 on BIG Chinese and Korean exchanges assp in Jan 2018. Binance, Huobi, Hitbtc and 3rd largest Korean exchange Coinone. Hempcoin (THC) is very popular for Asians, the uniqueness being the only agriculture token and privacy crypto debit card. It is a mathematical certainty it will be listed in at least 2 of the above mentioned exchanges by mid Feb. Coinone will take in THC because it just listed Monaco, a crypto debit card token. What does it mean for valuation of THC coins? Listing on Chinese and Korean exchanges will increase 300% in valuation compared to Bittrex. Monaco went from $5 to $18 after it was listed on Chinese and Korean exchanges. Please share this info with the community, friends and family. Sell your car, mortgage your house, take a personal loan to amass your holdings for a sure win 10x gain. If you buy in after new year, it be too late."﻿
