Using the qt client, if I send coins, I can't pick my inputs addresses. So I can't signed the contract before making the transaction because I won't know my input addresses until the transaction is made.
Why does the seller need to know the inputs anyway? As long as they receive X BTC at Y address.

Deflation has other problems as well. It can crowd out and discourage otherwise worthwhile investments.
Suppose deflation was 10% a year as you said. Now suppose there was a project you could invent in that would give you a real return of 7%. That means the nominal rate would be *negative* 3%. You would not make this investment because you can do better by just holding currency.
Suppose inflation were 10% a year and you can invest in the same project. The real rate of return is still 7%, so the nominal rate would be 17%. You would make the investment because it's higher than your opportunity cost of holding currency.
Of course, inflation has it's own problems, so what you really want is a currency with a stable value.

I've watched plenty of Peter Schiff so I'm going to waste any more of my time with this one. But let me just guess what he said.
There's going to be massive inflation and the dollar is going to collapse and he didn't give any kind of timetable as to when this would happen. The guy has been making these predictions since 2008. Inflation is just around the corner! Well, as it turns out we've had less than 2% average inflation since 2008. I prediction without a timetable is worthless. Tell me *when* the massive inflation is going to hit, and I'll start listening.

The stock market went up on the Fed's announcement. This means the market believes that the Fed's policy will lead to higher growth than before.

Look, I like Krugman. I don't agree with him very often but that doesn't mean I can't like him. He's a smart guy. Unfortunately, he has a major flaw: his hubris know no bounds.




Perhaps Dr. Krugman should do a little more research and find the answers to these questions. He could then write a far more insightful column on bitcoin. I think he sees bitcoin as associated with the right. That's all he needs to hate it.
It's true that the work done to secure the network is wasteful and that a centralized accounting system would more efficient. Unfortunately, governments have not allowed such solutions to exist, so we have to use the decentralized block chain.

Disclaimer: I don't agree with analysis. 
Actually, it promotes risky investment. 
Image you have 2 possible investments. A safe investment with real possible return of 5% and a risky investment with a real possible return of 10%. Suppose that there is 7% annual deflation.
In order for the safe investment to make sense it would have a nominal return of -2%. Why bother with a -2% investment when you can get 0% (nominal) by just holding currency? Obviously you would not do the safe investment.
The risky investment would have a nominal rate of 3%. You're only rational choices are to not invest or make the risky bet. The safe investment is not economically profitable.
In an economy with stable prices, the safe investment would be a viable option.

QE is a demand side policy. 


Policy became more expansionary. The Fed reduced the rate of QE but they also used forward guidance to shape expectations the future policy will be more expansionary than previously believed. (A credible promise to be irresponsible in Krugman-speak)




You can't have both. Monetary policy is aggregate demand. If aggregate demand is too low, money is too tight. See [Ben Bernanke](

Ignoring the backdoor issue for the moment, what they are talking about is a distributed mixer.

Personally, I'd like to see the inflation schedule set to model gold better.
In a gold system, when the price of gold increases it incentivises mining. This causes the rate of new gold to increase, creating price stability. In bitcoin, more people mining does not change the inflation rate. I think the block award could be set proportionally to the hashrate adjusted for Moore's Law.

This is wrong. Bitcoin will have no effect on the business cycle because it will never be the *medium of account*. Bitcoin is a *medium of exchange*. In other words, it what you actually use to make a payment. Even if 50% of all online payments in the US were in Bitcoin, the prices would still be set in USD. The *medium of account* is what currency you think about prices in. Most people set their BTC price based on the current exchange rate with USD. If the exchange rate goes up, the price in BTC goes down. This is because the seller set the price in USD first and then converted to BTC.
It's the *medium of account* that determines price inflation, not the *medium of exchange*.

Say's law *is* true. 
But that doesn't make Austrian economics correct or Keynesian economics wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:27:58
From wikipedia:


The long term neutrality of money vs the short term non neutrality is one of the major assumptions in what defines New Keynesian econimics. New Keynesian economists say that monetary policy (and fiscal policy when interest rates are at the zero lower bound) should correct aggregate demand problems so that the rest of the economy functions in a classical way. In other words, with stable monetary policy (and fiscal policy when interest rates are at the zero lower bound), Say's Law becomes true.
Edit: I just want to point out that old style Keynesianism is pretty much dead and gone so the General Theory isn't as relevant as it used to be. New Keynesianism is the synthesis of Keynesianism with Monetarism and Classical economics. Most prominent macro economists are New Keynesians. (Krugman, Taylor, Woodford, Bernanke)

It's amazing to me how stupid some libertarians think markets are. If it market thought that Bitcoin will jump to $100-200 in the near future, the current price of Bitcoin would be a lot higher. If people thought they could make that much money by buying Bitcoin...they would. And the price would be driven up much closer to the expected future value. 
The market's expected future value is already baked into the current market price.

The Fed has done a pretty awful job of maintaining a stable economy since 2008. 
However, I would argue that's because they allowed NGDP expectations to collapse and deflation to happen in 2009. If they had done more "money printing" and kept NGDP expectations up, the recession would have been much lighter.

There are two kinds of currencies
1) Medium of Exchange - what you give to someone else to make a trade
2) Medium of Account - what goods are priced in terms of
A currency can be either or both. Most fiat currencies today are both. USD for example, is both. You go to the store to buy a widget. The price tag says $1 and you hand the cashier a dollar.
Bitcoin is just a medium of exchange at the moment. You shop for a widget online. The price is $1. You click "pay with Bitcoin" and it converts the price to Bitcoin and you exchange your Bitcoins for the widget.
To answer you question, when will Bitcoin become a medium of account?: probably never in the US. It's unlikely that Bitcoin ever get's large enough or stable (in terms of price) enough to displace the USD. Especially since you have to convert to USD to pay the taxman. However, I think Bitcoin could become a medium of account in places where the local fiat is unstable or untrusted.
edit: An example of a currency that is a medium of account but not a medium of exchange would be gold. It's too heavy to carry around, so you use bank notes as your exchange medium.
@_date: 2013-02-23 07:52:33
Sure it's *possible* that Bitcoin could replace all of the fiat currencies to become the medium of account, but if you think that's actually going to happen, you're living in fantasy land. Government taxes and spends over 20% of GDP. That alone will keep the demand for dollars strong.

Just because about.com (seriously?) says something doesn't make it true. Maybe you shouldn't have stopped at 101 because economists don't even agree that it's possible for a single currency to serve all three of those functions. They dumb shit down in 101 so that you can understand it.
@_date: 2013-03-14 04:49:00
Something that stored value without the other functions isn't worth talking about in this context.
This is just nonsense. Are you trying to say that something must have all three of those to be money? Because then you are saying that bitcoin is not money. Because it is not a medium of account and it certainly doesn't (at the moment) store a stable value.


What exactly does it invalidate?

The thing that is confusing people is that the term "deflation" can really mean 2 different things.
1) Deflation can mean increasing productivity resulting in lower prices. Overall, this is good for everyone. This is what "Austrians" think of when they hear "deflation."
2) Deflation can mean insufficient growth in the money supply to meet new demand for money. The money supply is only a small part of everyone's wealth. Money is really just a very liquid asset. If the demand for liquidity increases but the money supply doesn't change, this leads to insufficient liquidity. People are stuck holding illiquid assets they don't want because money is too expensive. This is what "Keynesians" think of when they here "deflation."
