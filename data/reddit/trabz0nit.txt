Definitely pulling my funds out and taking it offline. As for future trading, just have to make those extra steps to moving funds from offline to Exchange and vise versa with more effort. I see Coinbase has come to Australia and soon to launch ETC, so in direct competition with Bitfinex. I will now trade amounst the top 3 so I don't risk this crap of not being to access my funds and trade with BTC going so low. Lost that opportunity and also, yet to find if anything is missing.
I think it will take a long time for confidence to be back with Bitfinex, but the world is full of fools...
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:33:57
Interesting ....I don't have that issue being Australian. However Coinbase rejected my activation attempts because I was in Australia. Now they have just opened up shop in Australia.
I'm looking to enable Coinbase as well, even though I see some people state some negatives around it, practicality.
So far, Bitfinex has the best interace by far.

The lesson everyone should learn, don't leave a lot of your holdings at the EXCHANGES no matter which one it is. Unless they comply with banking standards, your money is under their power and you at their mercy. Put your BTC\LTC\ETH on offline accounts and use a client to transfer to and from the Exchange at a trading volumes. Most of my BTC is offline but LTC and ETH were not bc I didn't get around to doing it and for convenience reasons, I left it with BITFINEX, not going to be lazy any more. if you want any tips, I will be glad to share them (ie taking them offline)
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:05:51
Those who control the banks also have great influence, if not ownership, don't want any public curious about the word bitcoin, because bad publicity is still good publicity and hence will promote it.
As for the other theories, time will tell but there a no. of scenarios, inside job, actual hack, government sponsored false flag. HOw can we know.
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:07:36
scary, proves one thing, don't leave majority of your BTC with the Exchange, move your majority off line. And when prices or trade ready, just move them. I'm with Bitfinex and most of my BTC trading takes roughly about 30 min. (3 confirmations) before its in my account. I don't know if I'm affected because we don't have access.
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:19:17
Do you put money in the bank, that too is not your money. They can refuse you when eg. Greece scenario. Banks by their very nature loan more money than they hold, so your money is lent out with no guarantee it will be returned, unless the Gov. collects it. You too make assumptions that your wealth is safe, its not really. When the time comes, you too will find it shocking what they can get away with

I understand the need to make money on trading, etc but how can you feel comfortable to put so much money on a Exchange without some guarantees. I made assumptions that the site was secure\safe but I still wasn't prepared to put most of my BTC online. Sure Im not a high volume trader but was willing to take the opportunities when they arise.But without some definite guarantees like in the share market where you pay and the prod is under another (3rd) party control, separate from the exchange, then its high risk.The need for fast trading I understand but nether the less, it cannot take precedence over risk management. I don't have to say it do i, the evidence\proof is the end result, Bitfinex. I think all the exchanges are  alike and hence I too are contemplating how do I operate when there is money to made\its exciting but the risk is still high with these companies, who can follow suit anytime they like. These companies need to be audit-able and the results reviewed by professionals only then can you do what is practical.

i feel for your loss, these people are very unethical. They should be investigated by the law as they are not a open book which is the main issue. They think we have to, for some reason trust them with all their decisions with our money. a) its not our responsibility to make up for the short fall of people's bitcoins placed in Bitfinex hands, they people and Bitfinex should share that responsibility...including me. But my USD holding should be left alone along with ETH\LTC\ETC, if they were taken, its another matter.Now I want to know how much is BITFINEX putting forward for the thing they are most responsible for, what is its shareholders and executives responsibility for mismanagement. If we share the cost, everyone must share the cost!!! Me, I'm shortchange $15K USD.

Logic dictates the following: 
1. People will want to get their money out of the banks (eg. Greece, Cyprus, etc)
2. People will move their money onto some other currency that is viewed reliable and or gold
If Bitcoin is well known in that country and is view reliable, it will be one of the alternatives, but it will compete with Gold and other fiats.
Conclusion, Bitcoin will go up in price.
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:20:30
Like Andreas M. Antonopoulos stipulates, today BTC is like the early stages of the internet. Many changes will occur on the blockchain and forks but BTC will be better, more practical (and more expensive) for all developed countries. Other Crypto currencies, will have fit for purposes suited, eg. LTC for small value transactions, but BTC will be the gold equivalent. As to what happens in between, many business will either adapt \ merge \ die but the whole it will mature like the internet and travel in the right direction.

More specifics, bought it in August 2016 &gt; 7 months 11 days ago, in August the system halved in rewards. This wasn't the best time to assess the returns and hence so far 2.21177928 BTC payed. Mining before the halving was profitable, but not after (my conclusion).  I need to get back another 0.98822 BTC to break even. 
fyi, all my (most) BTC are offline under my control. even this wallet is not managed by them. Unfortunately there is no mechanism to sell the hashing power. I wanted people to have real facts to measure against using a calculator and the reality of it all. Use my 2 addresses to see what 16 TH/s actual now returns.
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:29:05
I think for the wallet service, I am happy with the functions, etc but maybe not the fee. Speed of confirmations is acceptable. Unless I have something better to compare too?
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:35:28
I agree with your comments, investing in mining at Genesis is not productive (from experience). The difficulty rate, made my investment negligible, this is what kills it. If BTC was to go significantly higher, then I get back my money but not my BTC return of investment as my initial outlay was something like 3.2 BTC. I bought 16 TH/s and after 186 days (+ original wallet of 35 days for 1APm7BtmcSyiymEpoDvmZ77YZar34k7dmk) this is the result&gt;  
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:18:43
The pattern is there, manipulation, observe the volumes bought to push up the pricing and then volumes sold which seems greater. Some people have the advantage because of their BTC numbers, and why wouldn't they do this. I think the exchanges should put limits as to how much you can sell and buy in a very short time. 
In addition my concern is they help destroy the confidence in BTC market and also annoying watching people run to the trading when this is clearly happening. Not good for the industry.
@_date: 2017-02-17 13:02:59
I would buy now, definitely. There has been enough media to let everyone know and anticipate an opportunity, as the date draws near so will (I believe) the price will inflate, predicable behaviour.If it gets approved, I wouldn't sell unless I feel the conditions fluctuate the prices or a bubble, meaning we expect it to drop sooner or later. I am in for long term and trade when things seem predictable\a pattern.

I have a colleague at work who has mined BTC in the earlier days and found it not profitable, and he couldn't even get rid of the gear at the time. He also bought BTC. Over the past 2 years I'm saying how its performing, etc and ask the question today, why you refused to invest even a little bit considering recent results. It seems he made a large amount of investment in the past and all of his attempts meant he lost significant (is what he said) amount. So he promised himself and his wife, he will stay away from all this. So it goes to show, sure its doing well now, but at many stages, its dropped and people did what is natural, cut your loses. Since BTC is the pioneer, there was nothing to compare against. Now the other crypto's are leveraging this, and the people who watched BTC grow, understand the nature of the beast, and hence know when to move across to ETH or DASH. But one must remember, identify hype and the bubble early so you don't get burnt. I recommend, just buy what you can afford and sit on it for years.
@_date: 2017-03-04 04:30:34
Come to think of it, he has a point. If there was a new world currency, say BTC, this 1% now become the new Rothschild's?

The assumption is the break of European is going ahead, with Britain and if Le Pen wins, France, then Italy, etc. I suppose sneezing at the fact that most of the reserve banks or central banks around the world are privately owned? The fact that America the most wealthy has to go to a private bank and ask for trillions of dollars for a loans to bail out other banks, and the inflation or interest is on the burden of each individual to pay it back even though its just printed.

So Amir Taaki must be a Kurd. The issue I have is that the YPG is a terrorist group. they work closely with the PKK. So their cause might be great against ISIS but they use this media communication as a tool to get support but what they really wanting to do, is carve up that region and create their own state. Why else would they do ethnic cleansing of the Arabs and Turkmen in that region. And guess who is always meddling in the middle east, the British. Hence why Amir is free to go.

thanks for the lesson. Its surprising and I can confirm that my account has accumulated many BTC via imports and hence many BTC left over from each wallet &gt; fragmentation (if this is an appropriate word). But I did use BlockChain's tool to pull them all into the one wallet, to consolidate was the intention. Was this a waste and I have 10 BTC in there so still the fee is still too high? If this is the case, Bitcoin will not be viable in my opinion for a everyday transaction based solution (DASH or something else will take this space)? Question, how does one work out what a reasonable fee will be? Also it also raises the question how do I move my BTC from an EXCHANGE into many offline wallets as I don't like the idea of having a wallet containing all my BTC. What is the best practice in this case?

If you do your homework, you will know the definition of a terrorist varies from the WEST based on their interests...some are terrorists and others are freedom fighters.

This was my original fear when my colleague first mentioned BTC to me just over 2 years ago... it still smells fishy at times when I see market manipulation and BTC still has the potential to be stealth weapon. But on the other hand, everything is going electronic so its a natural progression. I believe going paperless is the nail on the coffin as those in power have now the means to completely dominate us. Like Andrea said in one of the lectures, the NSA for sure has the ability to break the encryption, so they will use it when its required.
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:19:11
No matter how much logic one applies, if people see the price drop quickly, they panic and sell. The ones that have been here know if they hold on, the prices will come back and keep going as per the expected exponential chart many have mapped. These are for the people who are prepared for the long investment. Those who think they can make some money, by selling earlier and picking up cheap, many people try the same but many also get burnt. This ETF should have increased the price of BTC especially in the last week, and it seems the opposite. So there are people with too much money and BTC who are playing us all. The support line is there mathematically, and it will return to that eventually.
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:41:07
The criminals or mafia at the Fed. have more wealth than Bitcoin posses a threat. I'm sure they have a plan, and are watching the crypto industry and maybe having some input into it. They could easily bring out a coin that challenges all to dominate covertly.

Here are some facts... maybe you cant find them in any text book. 
In the USA in 1860, there was 1600 corporations issuing bank notes. 
There was 8000 different kinds of notes in the USA at the time. 
The government at the time, controlled 4% of the supply. 
The only thing that stopped it was the civil war breaking out and the government then wanted to control money. 
Inevitable its returning as new currencies from corporations like Apple Pay, Bitcoin, etc will do what the USA dollar does, especially when nations are now looking at removing OIL and USA decency, eg IRAN now will except other currencies for selling OIL. The petro dollar made the USA currency what it is today, RUSSIA, CHINA and others are already discussing moving away from the Dollar. You tell me how much can you print out from the Fed. Reserve before the USA dollar becomes a joke. Its only going to take one or two nations to stop trading with USA dollar for OIL and your currency is no more.

I don't believe Bitcoin changes should be drastic (if this is considered one - to many changes away from the original idea) but slow, its the nature of this open source\collaboration setup, it is slow but its a good thing.

Your issue is you trust the western media. Turkey has flourished under Erdogan and the 11 attempts to assassinate him have failed. He wins the elections because the majority want him. If you have any clue about Turkish history (you can tell i"m turkish right) since 2001, look what the Elite\Regime try to do to Erdogan getting in power. The people rose because they finally understand how they have been manuplated over the decades. Guess who supported this, the CIA, anytime a party came by the people, it was closed for "operating out of bounds" to their criteria. Erdogan is the only one who outplayed them. The IMF even made claims that his team are the best in the world at the time to deliver economic policy and progress. You just don't know why the WEST don't want him in power...You think its related to Islam...no its because a new boy on the block is saying I"m relevant in this neighbourhood and I'm going to take alot of BUSINESS from you.

And I take you have more credibility than the CEO of BTCC. I have a problem when people speak in absolutes, like you. "the buyers are real". You therefore leave your door closed (mind) for other sources and opinions. Just remember, money is king and people will do much for it.

Huobi is known to artificially prompt the figures up with internal self trading (no fees) hence high volumes which also effects pricing, I wouldn't trust this site, better with Bitfinex or someone else. Google it what some miner CEO has said.

Your missing one point, they act on dummy accounts so the highest bidder being false and the buyer being false, and there you go.

either way that is not acceptable especially when you want control your assets. I would move to another exchange... or  my two favourites

Some evidence... ATM restrictions to cash withdrawal is what? $800. $100 notes to be phased out. Transactions with paying bills or money exchange in most cases involves either a bank, corporation or government, hence your habits are captured. In the USA, there are banks that refuse to accept paper cash payments, they have to be electronic. eg Citibank refuses paper cash in Australia  The last thing left is when paper money is completely removed. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 05:28:05
its really about phasing out cash for the money supply to be managed by what is mostly done now, transactions via Government agents, Banks or Corporations. They want small denominations with restrictions on withdraws so eventually our wealth is managed by them 3.

"supposed to" and "is" are to different acknowledgments. Its design is currency but in reality its not there (yet) and this could be a long discussion and debate as to what is currency (today). But many support (industry) the fact its a store of wealth at this point but don't accept it as currency. eg. Banks don't. Where that magical line is, no-one can take that claim. You obviously have your convictions about Bitcoin and so do I, not arguing about that, I see its current status slightly different from you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:24:19
I say YES for long term. Its seems its the most consistent performer. I would also say buy ETH and DASH. Maybe 60%, 20/20%

People will make money out of BCH but nothing will top off Bitcoin as its the brand, irrespective of its performance. I believe if fees and speed become an issue, its stalls it progress (price as well) until a fix comes in and then up it goes again.

the charts, bit to late to respond as I was busy trading. Looking at Fibonacci Retracements at 26% means strong support.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:22:09
because BTC is not currency and not ready to be a high transaction item. Its taken the roll of store of wealth like gold, and hence other technologies will be for speed. Fees, not the biggest issue if its a store of wealth. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:41:18

no, you get the $1 equivalent of the time, not the BTC of the time. So this tells me, he lost 0.4 BTC over the period. They replaced the value of the BTC at the time and this they payed back. They should have paid the crypto equivalent.

i know of one exchange where its variance is $100 +, it takes some effort, I used ETH as a medium to move funds and hence BTC to sell at the costly Exchange... was a good day.
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:08:47
No... its because the growing rich Chinese population is having plenty of money to invest and want to invest abroad for better returns, very much like what the Japanese when their economy was booming. From what I see on some reports, many Canadian houses are empty because they buy and sit on the property, for the property price to rise. So they are have some neighbourhoods with few neighbours now. We here in Australia are having a similar thing but our laws prevent them from having the same impact to Canada.
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:11:46
You need to be reminded that it was their fault, not the customers. 2nd, my USD and ETH was taken off me (1/3rd) ~ $15K, how is it my responsibility to pay for others BTC missing. 3rd They gave no indication as to when it will be payed back so I had to cut my loses like many because I would rather have the $6k, not knowing when we will be fully funded back, hence have the $6k work for me in trading or BTC growth in value over time 4) BTC is statistically \mostly likely on a growing trend to go up in value over a period of 1 year, not to your scenario going backwards over time when everything says it will only grow in value. Finally they should have given us the option.
@_date: 2017-04-26 00:03:47
If they can get away with it, they will do it.
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:39:06
Not so easy, the value of my bitcoin and cryptos at the time were replaced by one dollar. I had no intention of selling at that rate of the incident and now the tokens don't replace the increase of my bitcoin and other tokens. Eg I had a 1000 ETH removed and at todays price, its no comparison. 
I give them credit to restore what was taken but it doesn't remove the issue of lost wealth.

@_date: 2016-09-03 07:59:34
The exchange is responsible for BTC safety, no different to a bank. Issue is trust setup, the exchange should be setup such that BTC are released when 2 or 3 parties agree to release the funds...eg. using split wallet - into 3 or any other mechanisms. The issue might profitability for the exchange as costs go up.... so it might be a case that there should be less exchanges, greater trading at these exchanges who then can afford more overhead costs
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:26:50
Yep.... its really all over? Bad idea. Lets go over what I recall, buying Dash at $10 and ETH at $8 so lets work the maths over the past year and half. .25% of current value of ETH= $216 and DASH = $248, etc.... YEP your maths show all this as a loss?
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:41:17
What a group of people agree it to be. Obviously the more individual or unique of the item\money, the better the trust\security can entrust in its function and value. Eg. Bitcoin is not clone-able or able to copy, so what it represents is part of the true ecosystem, then its reliable, not forgeable. This is a response in terms of our current topic.
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:53:21
Nothing replaces experience to convince people of the message. Hence I would go to another bank and keep as little as possible fiat in there. Store your wealth in Crypto and when you need it, go through the selling process and withdraw.... hence you avoid that day. Big note, keep little as possible in the exchange unless you trade.

Your comments demonstrate that your not familiar with Share Market Analysis and hence your commentary. Its normal for such new developments to cause excitement,  overpricing and then correction. Your comments demonstrate you don't understand or not educated in the life cycle of a Share Market Analysis. I would recommend you spend some time learning\understanding what's happening before looking for guarantees. There is no such thing as guarantees otherwise everyone will do it. Not in business, shares or new markets. You lack the aptitude and are suited for more safer markets with less gain. There are people who take more risk along with understanding and hence the Bill Gates of this world are rich. Your lack of educated decision making is what governs you, not me. I see where Eth, Dash, Bitcoin is heading and am willing to take risk because I believe it will succeed because there is a market for it. You don't.  Fyi, made so far over a 1M and going strong with the decisions I make.

I thought of such scenarios and bought a MacBook Air, purely to minimise risk for hacking in some form of way. In addition I only use this laptop only for finance or personal stuff. I enabled encryption on my drive (encrypted) so any files taken are useless and as well as using a password management software (keepass) where I copy and paste the password. I know its not the best but its better than nothing. The keepass file is generally backed up to a usb. Note as long as the files on my pc, it can't be opened elsewhere. In addition, I have installed VPN solution "IPVANISH VPN", and if you need to, install TorBrowser. This I believe minimises risk but ensure you have good practice\behaviours when it comes to protecting your data and PC\Notebook, that is the key.

Your short experience in the crypto world really doesn't qualify you to have an opinion in terms of trading. I had 2 years of buying up BTC and probably 5 months before just hearing about mining something. When I understood 5 months later (a colleague explaining it and me reading up on it) I believe in it all the way through. I understood money and what is money during this journey so I put my money were my mouth was when others feared putting in such commitment ( large sums of your life savings), excess of 150K throughout in 4 months. From the initial price back then of $300 USA, I still have some 1/4 left, During that journey I diversified. I think I'm qualified more to have an opinion, and BTC will grow (developed) into a mature software product but it wont ben the only one. The USA had over 8000 currency in the early 1800's, via corporations, and it tool an elite group to control the money supply. I support the downfall of that and make money at the same time.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:28:55
The difference here is that BITCOIN is money, all the other items are commodities. It is a different beast. To be fair, BTC needs to be compared to others in its category, the issue is, there is only one I can think of, such as IMF currency SDR. Bitcoin is mostly considered a commodity? but that from those who control the money supply, however we and a few countries except it as a payment system or money. So there is nothing to compare it with if we are to do justice with it.

I do understand what your saying however I do believe like BTC,  ETH will be successful and its rate of rise will be steeper than BTC and maybe surpass it. It will like Andreas says have its place as well. Ripple I believe will be eventually a means of equity transfer, however if I feel either BTC or ETH is about to make significant progress, I will switch over. BTC will take some time for Segwit, if that is close, I will then jump ship and so on... we cannot just go with our initial decisions, Altcoins are making progress as well, eg. DASH and ETH are progressive in development.

Today they are 13 and 16, and early this year I swapped them over for Ripple and ETH. Today their wealth is worth $8705 and $3672.

Can be true and is still good. But better as it demonstrates no all of us knew about BTC 4 years ago. 2 years ago, at 300, I bought lots, however luck has it, buying ETH at $7, turns out to be better for late joiners. So it really depends on when you come on the scene. I believe now is the best time because it seems what ever you pick, just goes up.

Have been doing very well with the choices. Have plenty of ETH and moving some of this, guessed it, 20K into stratis,... missed the early buy but believe it will go up in a years time, they have a good plan\schedule. Long term, sticking with Ripple, ETH, DASH. and BTC, for now.
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:36:40
Is this assessment based on hatred for the banking system or actual research on the ripple architecture \ strategy. I don 't like the fact how ripple evolved but its found its niche where others have not done for the likes of BTC, DASH, etc its protocol accommodates the SWIFT system, this you cannot deny. I might as well profit from what is going to happen, but its not the only thing I back, I believe DASH and ETH are developing fantastic niche's as well, meanwhile we will wait for the slow BTC to evolve... being SEGWIT2, hopefully soon 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:51:40
I have made a significant effort in reading up on Ripple and the companies strategy and approach to the banking or financial industry. They are very professional, they have runs on the board, their customer base trusts them and they have a good relationship with the banks and their product has been tested and proven to be significantly superior than anything out there. I relate to their approach as an IT Professional who has done projects with large companies. They are gaining a lot of trust from the banks and their strategy just impresses me. Eg. Hiring an high exec from SWIFT as an example. The banks are not going to abandon this investment or partnership with Ripple labs for some new comers as they have made a lot of inroads with this technology. They also don't announce much and work in stealth as banks like it. So I believe in it significantly that I'm willing to spend a lot. no risk no large gain.Note: People are not patient enough to reap the rewards, towards the end of this year. Note another thing, when people sell XRP its in little doses, so when that day comes, you will struggle to buy large volumes. In two years, I believe it will be between $2 -$5. Once it passes the $1 mark, trading then goes into the .10 bidding. Once it goes above $5, they will trade in the .20 or more bidding. Just need patience.
