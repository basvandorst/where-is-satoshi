Accuity Magazine Writer Grant Anderson says, "as criminal offenders have found at the cost of their liberty, bitcoin ownership and provenance can be established from the blockchain. Even the UK Treasury acknowledges that Bitcoin is only perceived to be anonymous."
So, no. But it does tend to be associated with the dark net. I could see why they may see it as a red flag at this stage of its evolution.

Technologies' evolutionary direction depends on who exploits it the best. Banks and paypal want to stay relevant. The survival instinct is stronger than the innovation one.. So they will morph bitcoin to their advantage. Whether or not it is a failure is a personal opinion and depends on which side you're on. Grant Anderson, a chartered accountant, states that bitcoin is not as anonymous as one might think. Bitcoin ownership *can* be established from the blockchain.

Definitely going to be huge but the kinks and downsides of crypto need to be worked out for it to be accepted on a larger scale. The main challenge, according to Latvian economist Alina Dibrova, "is the creation of such climate that would eliminate virtual currency’s’ possible use in illegal transfers.” Once that gets figured out it may take over fiat.

"Health systems can be developed to send out advice and warnings to the individual as soon as a health issue arises."
This is probably one of the most useful aspects of blockchain. Transparency of health records can be tools to catch life\-threatening disease before they become issues. Modern solutions become adapted to every individuals' unique needs.

As Peter Lee, Editor of Euromoney puts it, "Cryptocurrencies will not be a technology that changes banking technology but rather that banking technology will change some aspects of it to suit themselves." Sounds about right. Banks will find a way to use it to their advantage and incorporate it into their system.

There's no reason it wouldn't be...the real estate market is changing from A-Z. You can now design a house and walk through it in VR before it's even made, virtual real-estate is also a new market to get into.. Any and all types of middlemen are pretty much done for now that person-to-person sales are becoming the norm and *can* become the norm. My parents bought their house last year and payed 6&amp; in commission fees to the realtor. (about 60k) Never going to make that mistake!

I'd rather have a 1970 dodge challenger, supercharged. White...To respond seriously to what was clearly a joke, because it shows what people do when they don't really understand the value of money. They throw it out the window. In a decentralized world pretty much anyone can do this if they make a few right decisions without having to do much work at all.
