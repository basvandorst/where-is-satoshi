There are only a handful of states that have explicitly ruled the act of online gambling as illegal.

Okay - I am just finishing up Module One of this course and it is already spawning some ideas in my mind about how to speed up the Bitcoin network effect. Essentially, my idea is to get the knowledge (and/or usage) of Bitcoin out of your immediate circle of friends, through a "bridge" friend, i.e. someone you are friends with that is part of seperate social circle.  
My idea is to send something like $20 worth of bitcoin to each of 5 Bridge friends, and to have each of them send $10 of those bitcoin to one of THEIR bridge friends.
This would essentially nucleate new Bitcoin user nodes in ten distinct social circles.  IMO people need to get their hands on Bitcoin and actually use it before the become really motivated to learn more about it and become excited by it.  When they do this, they will likely share their knowledge and newfound excitement with their immediate social circle of X friends. 
So for $100, I can potentially influence and educate 10*X people about Bitcoin.

Just watched the video you linked.  Awesome production value.  Just had to note the commentary at 1:23 after recent events... -_-
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:47:32
Thanks for the constructive critique!  Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:38:28
That is epic.

Wow, thanks @_date: 2014-03-05 20:51:50
Fucking epic.

I just nominated him too.  He is my favorite speaker on Bitcoin by far.  Dat Passion!

Mark Williams enjoys the Koolaid.  Power currupts, and centralized control of the world's reserve currency is the ultimate power.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:25:55
Damn he speaks well.  Very quick, positive, consice answers.
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:47:16
Zero confirmations is fine for things like food purchases.  I'm not wrong am I?   
Isn't the only risk with zero confirmations something like a double spend attack?  Why would someone do that type of attack for ~$20?

I am not at fault in any way and that is why it is utter bullshit.  I guess you could say it was my fault for putting a paypal donate button on my website. :/
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:33:55
I got the same.

A couple months ago I paused my modest weekly coinbase purchases.  With this recent price drop, along with a couple above-average months at work, I have been itching to resume.  This post pushed me over the fence.
Commence stacking BTC!!!

Thank you - I suppose the buyer is most likely an innocent victim of credit card theft as suggested in the previous post.  I have edited out the names in both posts..

Gosh, when he mentions their expansion onto 3 continents along with the potential in SE Asia and India with a billion+ technical population... itshappening.gif

Thanks for the tip It feels really good knowing this tip isn't going to get charged back in the near future at the equivalent cost of four old fashions to myself. :)

I am no expert, but it says regarding that price,

Came here to say this.  The dollar is worth what people agree it is worth... not what the government says it is worth.

I prefer not to share the website as my identity could then be easily linked with this reddit account.

Aha!  That makes it even better, in an ironic sort of way. :)

zero bitcoin donations thus far.  Not a typical bitcoiner target audience on my website.

I already had a Bitcoin donation address up. :)
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:12:58
I agree as well.  Definitely feels like there is blood in the streets around these parts.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:27:19
Is it just me, or does it feel like the dam is breaking and we are beginning to feel a flood of merchant adoption?
@_date: 2014-02-13 13:13:47
Same reaction here!  I think this is the first time I've heard a mainstream Bitcoin report that didn't include a single mention of illegal activity.
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:47:05
here we go

I feel giddy.  
Also, if we set a calibration of $1 to a mile, we still have a long ways to go before we get to the moon.  When we hit $1,000 we will only be 0.42% of the way there. :D

All bank deposits in Cyprus experienced a mandatory "bail-in" earlier this year, where people lost half(?) their balances to bail out the banks.  If that isn't reason to move your wealth out of the banking system, I don't know what is.

tldl; Peter uses a lot of fuzzy math in attempts to back up his arguments.
