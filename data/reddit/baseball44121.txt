I moved everything off coinbase. They hate Canadians, don't support Segwit, and love to try and manipulate markets (i.e. bcash).

Their excuse for not allowing Canadians to withdraw is that their payments provider shutdown.
The only issue is that their payments provider shutdown in fucking August 2016 and coinbase hasn't done anything about it. Ridiculous.

Canadians can't sell bitcoin either on coinbase. They said they lost their payments provider back in 2016 and still haven't got a new one.
They sure as shit let us buy it though.

I hope you didn't invest a dime that you can't afford to lose. All investments are like that. Inherently risky but the payoff is great.

They literally just said the exact same thing.

I will always hodl until I decide to stop.

I've had BTC since 2014. The ability to sell has come and gone. Likely will never come back. I don't have much but I'm going to move on out of coinbase sooner rather than later.

Too bad Canadians aren't considered part of the "all customers" definition.

Can someone tell me how you're able to tell that this particular block means segwit has locked in?
Is it because enough people ( &gt; 95%) were signaling BIP148 or whatevertheheck and then this block was mined?
I'm a nub

Same here man. I'm not investing large amounts of money I just have some bitcoin from about 2 years ago that I've basically just let sit in coinbase for a few years. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:31:28
I sure hope so!
