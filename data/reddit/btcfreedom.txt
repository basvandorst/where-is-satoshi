Although I wish it would happen, it is highly unlikely for PokerStars to re-enter the US market.  The head of Pokerstars Isai Scheinberg had to make deals with the US government back a few years ago when they seized his money. If they served the US market through Bitcoin, it would anger the Feds a lot, and put PokerStars in hot water again. The risk of serving US players in any way would far outweigh the benefit for PokerStars since they are already the most giant poker site by far, and no other site will ever come close to their network effect any time soon.
I don't think it would affect the price that much, but it is one more good thing Bitcoin is used for.  I had hoped some of the alternative Bitcoin poker websites like [sealswithclubs]( or [nitrogen poker]( would gain more steam, but their growth has been very slow.
Edit:  Bitcoin may make VPNing into pokerstars much easier however.  Its funny how online poker is banned in China as well, but the Chinese just use a VPN to play.  Its only because the USA burned PokerStars so hard before that they were scared away completely.

Well when it comes to web wallets, I try to use them as little as possible.  I would suggest trying [electrum]( if using a computer.  Its really easy to use, and gives you full control over your private keys.  Just write down the 12 word seed phrase as your backup, its a 1-time backup. Edit: Also with electrum there is no need to download the blockchain for 3 days, as with the original Bitcoin Core client
For web wallets, blockchain.info seems pretty trusted although they have had some security concerns recently, and a lot of people have been claiming to get their coins stolen there. Also I like to use [rushwallet]( sometimes because its super easy to set-up and use, but I wouldn't want to trust any web wallet with too much money at a time.
Also check out mobile wallets if you are interested, like Breadwallet, or Airbitz for i-phone.  [This wallet]( seems ok for Android.  Also Mycelium is a popular mobile wallet.

Yeah I suppose you are right. I just hate the narrative that we always hear, about government is creating jobs, government is making us safe, etc..  At a certain point, I really do want to rub them the wrong way, because I am just sick of tyranny and the common assumption that government hangs the sun in the morning.  
It does feel a bit uncomfortable to speak out, because it will rub those statists and ignorant people the wrong way. They will attack and call you names, and use flawed arguments against you. Sure I guess you have a good point it takes all types, and the deliberate gentle apolitical approach is good camoflauge to get things done in this crazy society. But it is my preference to just take the honesty approach and smack them in the face with a 2 by 4 of truth.  Surely there is a need for people like that as well?

Yeah sure.  But when you use an electrum seed it is called a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet.  Basically it can create millions(probably more, not sure the exact amount but its A LOT) of addresses all from the same seed.  Basically all of the addresses are created instantaneously when you first create the seed.  That is why you only need one backup. 
So yeah you can just record one or more of the addresses, along with the seed.  However if looking for long-term storage its best to do this in a complete offline environment. It is called "cold storage". One of the easiest and most common ways to do it is to create a live Ubuntu USB or CD. [Here](  is a tutorial on how to create a bootable Ubuntu USB from Windows. Make sure NOT to set up any persistence volume when creating it.
Ubuntu is a free very user-friendly Linux distribution, don't be too intimidated.  Once you set up your USB, you just plug it in and boot the computer, and it will boot into the USB drive instead of the hard drive.  You may have to change the boot priority options in the BIOS menu first so it will boot into the USB drive instead of hard drive.  Edit:  Also once booted make sure to just click "try ubuntu", and not install ubuntu.  You just want to try it out on the USB stick and not install onto your hard drive.
The reason for using the bootable USB is that from my understanding all data exists in memory and is essentially wiped when you shut down Ubuntu.  Once booted, connect your internet in Ubuntu.  Then just go to the software center on the left sidebar, and search electrum, and then download it and install it.  Then once electrum is installed it is important to then DISCONNECT the internet, and NEVER turn it on again until you shut down ubuntu.  Now click to launch electrum and record your 12 word seed and public addresses.  Then shut down Ubuntu, and you have created a pretty secure cold-storage wallet for long term storage in my opinion.
To restore the wallet, just download/install electrum and launch it, but choose the restore wallet option and type in your seed.  Then voila you have a live hot wallet again.

I have never used breadwallet, but there should be some sort of receive tab with your receive addresses.  They always start with a 1 and are a long list of alpha-numeric characters.  You will have more than one receive address.  Use a different one each time for more privacy.  
Just copy the address from bread wallet, then go to the "my money" section on changetip.com and under withdraw click the send button.  Paste one of your bread wallet receive address into the send field along with the amount and hit send and its done.  It may take some time for changetip to send the coins.

When you send funds in electrum it will choose whatever inputs are enough to cover the transaction.  Then the left over is sent to a change address.  It shows your change addresses so you can see what is going on a bit better, and probably to help you handle privacy better.
Here are some tips.  If you want to have more control over your addresses, then you can right click on an address then click "send from".  This allows you to select which address you want to send from instead of electrum choosing for you.  Also if you have used an address in the past, and don't want to reuse it for privacy reasons, then right click the address, then click freeze.  I believe this will freeze up the address so electrum won't use it as change anymore.  Also it may prevent spending inputs from that address until you unfreeze.
Also as far as receiving an e-mail, I prefer not to because of privacy concerns, but I can see why someone might want to receive an e-mail for convenience or business purposes.  There are probably some services that offer this just by searching the blockchain, but I believe you can still use blockchain.info for this.  Here is how you do it I think:
Go to blockchain.info and make a new wallet or log into your old.  Then click the import/export button.  It will give you a warning, but go ahead and just click through it anyways.  Then add any addresses you want an e-mail for into the "watch only" field.  Don't mess with the private key field though.  I believe this will allow you to then get e-mails using the watch-only addresses.  Hope this helps.

No the issue is really cold vs hot.  No matter what operating system you use, you can never be 100% sure that it is not compromised with malware. If the private keys were ever on a device that was connected to the internet, then you have a live hot wallet.  Depending on the level of security you desire, this may be acceptable.
If the keys were ever touching a device with internet connection, they have the possibility of being stolen by hackers and transmitted to the hacker over the internet.  That is why we create a cold storage wallet in a complete offline environment. Then even if the operating system was infected with malware, hackers still couldn't receive the data they need because there is no internet connection.

Are you sure your son is not a terrorist?  Just kidding.  Thats great that the younger generation are getting into Bitcoin.  Of course its something new so you are going to hear a lot of FUD about drugs and terrorism in the media.  
If you want to buy your son some Bitcoins its a great idea.  If in the USA I suggest purchasing through coinbase.com or circle.com.  Have him learn about different wallets and stuff as well. 
The beautiful thing about Bitcoin is that you can be your own bank and hold your own private keys to your own wallet.  No need to trust others who can run away with your money.  If using a PC I suggest downloading [electrum]( wallet.  Just write down the 12 word seed as your one-time backup of your wallet.  The good thing about electrum is there is no need to download the entire blockchain which can take 3 days as with the original Bitcoin Core client.
There are also many other types of wallets, you can see a good list [here](  If he has an i-phone or Android he can get a mobile wallet like bread wallet, or mycelium.
Also there are paper wallets such as with [bitaddress](  You can create a wallet and print it out on paper in the form of an alpha-numerical key as well as QR code.  
When it comes to Bitcoin, be careful because security is an issue.  There is a chance the coins could get stolen or hacked if your computer is compromised by malware.  Using [cold storage]( is one solution.  Another is to use a hardware wallet like [Trezor]( which keeps your keys entirely offline and safe from hackers.  But since you are just getting started you probably won't have very large amounts of Bitcoin yet (unless the price spikes again soon).
You can also use Bitcoin to buy many things, such as from Overstock, Dell, Newegg, Dish network, Expedia, TigerDirect.  You can donate to the Red Cross with Bitcoin.  You can play gambling games with it too, so its up to you if you want to allow your son to partake in that activity.  
There is a huge amount of stuff to learn about Bitcoin.  It is a revolutionary currency that will bring freedom back to the people and change the world for the better.
Here have some bits to try out.

Yes pretty much.  If you have a mobile phone wallet you can use the camera to scan a QR code to import the address.
I suggest using [Electrum]( for a PC wallet.  Just write down your 12 word seed phrase as a backup when setting it up. It is a one time backup. Good thing about Electrum is you don't have to download the blockchain which can take like 3 days. So instead you are up and running within minutes. You can also check out mobile wallets as well.  Try to choose a wallet where you control your own private keys so you don't have to trust others to hold them for you.  [Here]( is a list of wallets.

Congress would never pass a law like this because they are completely owned by lobbyists.

We need a secret ballot in congress, then they won't be owned as easily by lobbyists.
As it is now, they won't pass any good Bill for freedom or crypto-currency.  It will be hijacked by those who have a strong interest in seeing crypto held back.

Even if you make an error copying by hand, you are protected because the checksum at the end of the address has to compute in order for it to be a valid address to receive funds.  So if you make an error, it will most likely just say something like "error invalid address".

I have heard good and bad things about [bitaddress](  Some have said that the code has not been properly audited there, which is a risk. There were problems in the past with similar sites like brainwallet.org that used a bad random number generator/poor entropy to create addresses.  This allowed hackers to guess their private keys easily and steal their coins.  
If I were to use any paper wallet service I would use bitaddress because its been around the longest, and probably most trusted.  But personally I would limit how much I keep in any paper wallets created there, and prefer a more trusted way for cold storage.
However, if you choose to use bitaddress to create a cold wallet, you should follow a similar tutorial using Ubuntu.  But also make sure to download the [bitaddress html]( from github.  Just unzip the file and then use it to load up the bitaddress website without having to be connected to the internet.
Edit: Also if you are really looking for the most secure set-up for cold storage because you have a lot of coins, then you may want to use Bitcoin Core/QT instead for creating your private keys as the random number generator/entropy of that client has probably had the most eyes on it.  [Kristov Atlas]( has a good video tutorial on how to do it on Bitcoin QT in Ubuntu.  But it involves downloading the whole blockchain and can be a big hassle to restore the private keys when ready to spend.

Yes the addresses are created really in a chain.  So I believe electrum shows the first several addresses in the chain.  However I believe you can receive coins from any address deeper down the chain as well. I believe electrum will scan the blockchain and if it finds any transactions associated with your seed, then it will show them in your wallet.
Edit:  I think there is also something called a master public key, which can be used to determine all of your addresses.

Oh I never said it would replace the USD or Euro, I guess you like to put words in others mouths.  But how can you know for sure it won't?  I guess you have a crystal ball, but you seem like the dumb one.
Edit:  Also the AirForce sucks.  Of course Freedom lovers and intelligent people will receive this attitude from Air Force/Military government lovers.

I can't comment on all of the details, but overall sounds pretty good. I just made a [tutorial]( about cold storage with electrum too. One thing you can do is enlarge electrum to the whole screen, then click wallet and then "Master Public Key".  You can then use the Master Public Key to create a watch only wallet in electrum.
The one weakness I see in your implementation is that the USB could be corrupted and transferring it back and forth to the offline device could create a weakness, which you seem to know about.  Possibly if you could find a way to put the raw transaction into QR code form, and then transfer the QR code instead of USB, your set-up would be more bullet proof.  I have also heard of this done with sound as well, although I would not know how to do it.
Also could you give a link to where to download the Shamir Secret Sharing Java file to use on offline PC?

Bitcoin is decentralized.  I don't see United States or Euro powers falling.  I see the people of the United States and around the world gaining power through Bitcoin, freedom, and sound money.  Much the way the USA rose to prominence because we were Land of the Free.  I see power switching from the hands of corrupted people in the USA and around the globe and being transferred to more honest as well as productive players through the free market system.  We don't know for sure if this will happen, because we don't have a crystal ball, but the possibility is there with Bitcoin to succeed.
So you seem to be saying Bitcion/internet doesn't have accessibility without Western powers.  But people have smart phones all over the world now, and there is competition between service providers in many different countries. Internet is spreading fast and who even knows the leaps in tech we could make in the next 10 years for providing internet access.  If you knock internet down in one country, it is still up in another.  You think the "western powers'' are so powerful that they can kill the internet to save their FIAT system?  Don't you think the people have any power at all?  
Also if Bitcoin is banned or internet banned in one country, you can still use Bitcoin.  Watch this [clip at 1:59:20 mark]( Andreas Antonopoulos explains how Bitcoin can survive oppressive governments using short wave radio as long as there is open internet and free country somewhere else.
Edit: Also check out [Gresham's Law]( good money always wins over bad money.  Would people buy an alt-coin where the devs could create as many new coins as they want out of thin air? Of course not, so why would they buy FIAT dollars then, once they have an option of Bitcoin?  Once Bitcoin is more widely accepted and used, people will be jumping the sinking FIAT ship into Bitcoin.

I did read his chicken scratch but it didn't seem like there was much there worth commenting on honestly.  For example the part where he offers instead of the applicants "covering" the whole fee for the expense of processing the applications for license, he suggests having the applicants "help defray the cost".  Meaning they would not pay the whole price of the cost of the application process.  You may think oh that is nice, he is saving the applicants money, until you realize that you the tax payer will be paying the difference.
Interesting though how he calls her Dana by her first name, and also notes other recent discussions with her and further possible phone calls.  I wonder how many of the rest of the 3700+ commenters got one-on-one access, yet their letters were much more professional than this eye sore.

Bad idea, because it can be co-opted.  Also if we see who is fighting against us we can't do shit about it.  But the lobbyists will see who are fighting for them or against them and they will punish those against them and reward those for them because they have much more power than us, [as this video]( explains.

In your opinion.  Its easy to criticize the man in the arena. It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena. If he did such a bad job, maybe you should run for congress and do better.

Don't worry about trolls and shills bro, you are just acting rational.  As Milton Friedman says, the best defense against inflation [is high living](  Now you have found something that can effectively hedge inflation, which is why Bitcoin is allowing you to save.

He mentioned a thing called [chirp]( which allows you to transmit data over sound.  You can use this to transmit Bitcoin transactions.  Since the ledger is public, there is no security issue with broadcasting the signed transaction over sound.
[The video on their FAQ]( explains it well.
As far as functionality, it makes it easier to send bitcoin.  You could send it over the phone, or radio.  You don't have to scan a QR code to import the address, because you can use sound instead.  Also perhaps you want to hide a transaction inside a photo or music for some reason, you could do that as well.
They also talked about how with HD wallets, you can backup the keys to your wallet using a 12-word seed.  This seed would be secret but you could hide it in many places, making it hard for people to guess.  For example Andreas explained that you could make the words as coordinates in a book.  Then tell someone, ok 1st word is page 107, paragraph 3, sentence 2, word 6, and so on.  I guess it has some interesting possibilities.
@_date: 2014-12-02 23:50:17
Ridiculous.  Infrastructure for Bitcoin is in place around the globe, and it wasn't government that created it, but the free market and the people that created the infrastructure.  You can't stop the internet just like you can't stop Bitcoin because it is decentralized.  You can transmit Bitcoin over radio signal, using a train rail as an antenna.  You vastly underestimate the power of the free market to provide solutions to any problems Bitcoin has.  Those "weaknesses" are opportunities for those of us that aren't government parasite workers.  You should look up Gresham's Law, the good money chases out the bad.  If you think people want inflated debt money that is printed out of thin air by a few corrupt individuals, then you are sadly underestmating the power of humanity.
Yes its not possible with other currencies to send money around without a fee.  Please tell us how it is possible.  Even when paying the huge fees you have to get permission and then often wait days for the money to arrive.  With credit cards and paypal the settlement time is months, where with Bitcoin the settlement time is 10 minutes on average.
Please get a real job and stop sucking off of the tax money of the real producers and contributors to the economy, and if you are in the Air Force, then try to think about all of those innocent children across the globe that you have supported the droning and murder of.

Unfortunately Bitcoin Core/QT is not an HD wallet, and thus does not use a 12 word seed the way electrum does.  If you already sent your coins to the Bitcoin QT wallet, unfortunately you will have to download the entire blockchain which can take up to 3 days.  Then when you are done with that you can send the coins to electrum.  
It sucks, but it would have been better if someone warned you before hand that you need to download the whole blockchain for Bitcoin Core/QT client.  There may be other ways to extract the private key and create a raw transaction without downloading the whole blockchain.

Whattt?? lol...This is very worrying, because Bills always do the opposite of what they say, like "The Patriot Act" was unconstitutional and very unpatriotic.  The "Affordable Care Act" did not make Care affordable, but more expensive.
@_date: 2014-12-04 11:13:05
Lol yeah I agree, I am super skeptical of any government action.  But the text of the Bill would actually reverse what they did last year when it comes to the tax:




The Bill also proposes a 5 year moratorium on cryptocurrencies.
Too bad it will never pass as is.
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:50:40
I thought the Affordable Care Act was a lot more absurd than Stockman's Bills.  I like his Bill proposals that would hold the IRS accountable for attacking political enemies, and arresting Lois Lerner.  Shouldn't government criminals be held accountable too?

I am not for sure, but I think it depends on how you use the foreign currency.  I have heard that if investing for gains like in forex markets then you pay capital gains tax.  But say you travel to Europe and buy some Euros to spend there.  But on the way the exhcnage rate of Euro increased by 3%, I have heard then you will NOT have to pay capital gains taxes when you buy dinner at a restaurant or go to the zoo in another country.
This would be better for Bitcoin, because then you wouldn't have to keep track of capital gains whenever you buy products or services.  Although it is not even clear that you have to do so now, but there is much ambiguity around it and the IRS ruling that Bitcoin is property.

I used to believe in global warming too.  But now I am very skeptical of global warming.  I don't think CO2 emissions are that harmful.  I have studied it a lot and the Earth has natural mechanisms to create a balance. Plant growth surges when CO2 levels are high, reducing the CO2 and creating oxygen for us to breathe.  As the Earth warms, more rain falls which helps sequester the CO2.  Also more clouds form as the earth warms, increasing the albeto effect, keeping temperatures lower.  Plants and humans have a symbiotic relationship with each other.  I think the climate change issue is much more complex than people want you to believe. Scientists have no idea how to calculate the true global warming effect of CO2 emissions because it is so complex.  Bottom line, if climate scientists try to claim they know it all, they are lying. 
At the end of the day it seems if global warming were true then it is actually a good thing for the economy and allows humans to produce more when things are not as cold.  Crops are more bountiful.  Production is usually up in summer time compared to winter. Businesses like GE who have a near monopoly on energy production love the cap on emissions.  It puts their competition [out of business]( and allows them to secure their monopolies.  This is why the head of GE is on Obama's economic board.

Libtard platitudes? Facts are not platitudes my friend.  If you work in the public sector and love government/tryanny so much then maybe Bitcoin is not for you. Bitcoin is about freedom and sound money.  It is a Revolution and paradigm shift.  Why can't somebody promote freedom without getting attacked and called names by public sector government lovers?  I suggest you leave this sub and pray to your Lord and Savior Obama every night then if you don't like Bitcoin or Freedom.

I agree transparency is needed in some areas, but secrecy is needed for voting.  When watching your video, the point that convinced me was that the congressmen were not allowed to defect against their lobbyists when the vote was transparent, because the repercussions were too severe.  But when the vote was secret it allowed them to defect and vote their conscience and what they thought was best for the people.  Having secrecy greatly lessened the negative repercussions from their lobbyist contributors.
It would be great to have transparency in the vote counting, yet secrecy in the actual voting using cryptography.  David Chaum's work looks rather interesting.
