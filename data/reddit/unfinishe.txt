It isn't directly on GLBSE, but there sure are a whole lot of "pass-through" bonds routing to BTCST.

Like I said below, I don't expect it to be a perfect sample, but I hope we still get enough responses to make it useful. I wouldn't ask for e-mail if I knew about a better way to deter spammers, because it does make it seem pretty fishy...

Sorry about that. I think I fixed it now, but let me know.

Thanks. I expected that there would be some who would not want to give out their e-mail address (I don't actually store it, but I suppose that there's no way for you to confirm that.)
But hopefully that won't prevent too many people from taking it. Of course this won't be a perfectly representative sample of the Bitcoin community, but given its nature, I don't think we will ever be able to achieve that.

...or 2 "(Bit)cents". Pun intended.

No, I guess we just both happen to use Heroku. Heroku is an application hosting service, similar to Google Apps.

Okay, so I don't know whether anybody will read this, but since a lot of you didn't want to go through the Google authentication, I decided to put in an alternate solution.
I can generate one-time tokens for anybody that wanted to take the survey, but hasn't yet because of the authentication issue. Just PM me and I'll send one your way. I really do want as many people as possible to be able to take it.

You don't have to give that away if you don't want to, though...

Sorry if you tried to take it and there were some errors. I accidentally crashed the system for about 5 minutes, but it should be fixed now.

There should be a "No Thanks" button on the end screen if you would rather not give a Bitcoin address.
