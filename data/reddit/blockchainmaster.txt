Why must a blockchain be permissionless? 
Clearly what the banks and big tech companies are working on is a permissioned ledger using some type of "the original" blockchain elements. 
The sooner hodlers get it the better. 
The "OG" blockchain type has ts application but so do the private permissioned ones.
Its like saying the "internet" can only be for Geocities...

We have to raise the standards. We are talking about a 7 billion dollar industry. This is not a fucking basement neckbeard card trading gig. 
You want more MtGoxs and Cryptsys? 
If they handle and hold peoples' money they must comply with relevant auditing and regulation. 
You want to buy annonymous? Meet a guy in person.
No big money will go in bitcoin until they are certain the platform they are using is legit. 
Crypto exchanges (no fiat) can be less strict.

I completly agree. Bitcoin is not meant for transacting to buy stuff.
I belive bitcoin has the potential to be a serious store of wealth and is good to move somewhat large amounts of value. Its ledger has potential to transform many centralized services as well.
This is why I hodl. 
Lately, though, my faith in bitcoin has dwindled because people figured out the POW part is not neccessary to use alot of bitcoin's features.

Bitcoin sucks. "Blockchain" good.
We know.
Don't get left behind bag holding because our 3 tx/second elitist "blockchain" failed to get traction.
"Blockchain" can and is being removed from the cryptocurrencies and the tokens themselves seem to stagnate and go through hype cycles strictly for speculation in a heavily manipulated "free market".
I think the get-rich-quick part of bitcoin has long passed. Early investors got paid handsomly. 
Use bitcoin but don't expect to get rich off of your small stash of coins.
Disclaimer: i might of course be wrong but look at even how the btc price has not gone up with the upcoming halving... do you expect tremendous growth after it happens?

Use previous numbers to derive a new number.

The longer it takes you to get the previous lucky number (block propagation) the worse it is.

Segwit is mainly a fix to malleability in order to allow sidechains and LN type systems. 
There are other ways to do that, like Flextrans developed by other developers than Core. I am sure it is possible to implement LN even with malleability, but it depends on what you are trying to achieve. 
It is absolutly possible to create layer 2 for big blocks Cash and nobody in their right mind advocates to never do that.

like I said, it depends what you need to do with it. There will be many different implementations of LN, not just one. 
The malleability thing is mostly overrated as you can see bitcoin has been working fine with it. Some consider it a feature and not a bug because it allows certain things as well. Google it. 
Malleability got a bad rep because Karpeles blamed it on the MTGOX collapse... I think it was criminal negligence and disregard for security and possibly straight up theft by him.

if you want a centralized service it is cheaper to use a debit/credit card already. 
for bitcoin, unlikely since the tx thoroughput of bitcoin (even of bch) is not nearly high enough for this application. Possible that LN can do that but it doesn't exist yet so hard to judge. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:27:49
that's mostly due to politics not the code itself. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 23:26:35
So i take it it is 7.5% markup? 
@_date: 2016-10-10 00:37:59
Best thing to do is get a small amount and play with it until you understand you it works. I would recommend to not worry about mining, since you can't make any money doing it.
Send it, recieve it, learn to use backup in wallets, and read alot. 
And don't treat bitcoin as savings. It is a speculative investment and is pretty much gambling. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 19:33:08
So if I take the bitcoin code line by liner and add a feature to it, how is that not more innovative?

You are absolutly correct but you are preaching to people who believe the sun orbits the earth.... how can you reason with religious fanaticism?

Dumping into fiat might not be possible for everyone. Altcoins might all set ATHs.

Never hold much money on an exchange! This applies to any crypto!

So then Counterparty and every other token too.

If you think that long term btc will be more expensive, buy any time now. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:16:27
And reduce blocksize to 700kb during the uasf, right?

You have no clue what you are talking about. Hacking it?  
Besides, any modern crypto outperforms litecoin in every aspect.

Sub 100mm coins might have an explosion

You can say bitcoin is controlled by handful of businesses and miners in China like freakin Jihan.

Intetesting. Will look into it. The EVM is just ad secure as bitcoin, still. 
Poor code by a third party is expected, and it is not reserved to just ethereum. 
Edit: you might be reffering to eth running out of gas due to a network overload from the BAT ico. In this case nothing was hacked. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:11:47
I thought pumping altcoins is no bueno over here? 
On the same note, you should buy ethereum as a hedge not this LTC ancient shit. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:27:10
Did you also truly hate it when btc mining switched to GPU from CPU? Did you rage this much when the first ASIC came out? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:49:48
That's bullshit. In many ways China is far more capitalist than the US. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:19:24
Ethereum recently became the most "secure" blockchain. Don't make bold ststements out of your ass.  
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:00:54
So bitcoin only good for transffering in and out of exchanges and using darknets? Cool..?
@_date: 2017-06-01 22:30:23
Elaborate?
