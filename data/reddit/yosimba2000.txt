They're not even white. Man, if I'm going to get fake teeth at least I'll go for the white ones.

Do you know the magnitude by which the USD or EURO fluctuates each day? A thousandth of a dollar. A tenth of a penny.
They are NOT comparable in magnitude.

You mean the housing bubble? The value of the dollar didn't crash, it was the value of property investments.

Fiat's back by the US govt. They provide the stability and worth of our money.

Oh god .-.
Have fun with your net worth fluctuating up and down 50%.

My point is exactly that. Govt backed securities are much more stable.

Until one of the major goverments starts backing crypto and has insurance on it, crypto is going nowhere. Let's not forget that BTC dropped 66% since the 19,300 high of December 2017. BTC is way fucking volatile and is backed by nothing but hype.

Cryptos are holding their own? Really?
Did you forget the 50% drop from the end of January to beginning of February? 12k to 6k
Keep drinking that Koolaid

Then the perceived value of Bitcoin is in its anonymity.
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:13:02
No such assumption... 
All I'm saying is cryptos can fall just as hard as the stock market can.

Anything can be used as a currency. 
Problems with BTC are volatility and transaction times.

it's a very very very minor player as a medium of exchange
most of the transactions are from btc to usd, or the other way around.
