Good then. It will be interesting to see how it all works out for multi-hop situations, where nodes might time out frequently. Also, presenting this protocol to the larger population is not going to be the easiest thing; justifying the channel funding stage, hiding details and showing only the essential stuff... In a year or so it'd be interesting to make a graph of the LN and see "hubs" and etc develop.
Thanks for your time!

Is running a full node from a university network connection a good choice? Very good up/down speeds.

Can someone explain the funding demands of LN for, say, a 3-hop channel? Does it require every node to have the amount X i want to route? Or does it require me to fund 3X on the open-channel transaction?
This is the one major detail that is bugging me about LN. Great job nonetheless!

Disclaimer; i'm a noob.
The Bitcoin protocol is designed to avoid that, and it is fundamentally an argument from social economics. BTC has a specific value given by the consensus of millions of people to use it as a means of value exchange. If a few miners fork the blockchain and create a new block (thus diverging from the usual blockchain), the value of their new coins depends on their usage. Initially, they are worth nothing, and unless a big part of the population transition to this new blockchain, they will stay being worth nothing. So miners working on the forked blockchain are initially mining worthless coins.
IF you can coordinate a 51% exodus, then the rest will follow, 'ideally'. But that's a big if.

Very nice explanation, thank you.

Every single upgrade is an attack? I can understand such arguments for quick and 'emotional' upgrades (2x, e.g.), but SegWit and LN are great ideas which maintain the core stable and allow for greater flexibility.
I don't see how Bitcoin could scale otherwise.

Ah, I get your point. Bitcoin preserves its strength by having a stable ('carved in stone') protocol specification. Encouraging continuous 'improvements' on top of that is a dangerous path.
Instead, i guess we should focus on building on top of the blockchain.
Thank you for speaking so well, especially in a place that can be so toxic!

Some people expect Bitcoin to become as widespread as a fiat currency (dollar, euro, e.g.), so there won't be a need to exchange BTC for USD if you can buy everything in BTC, and the valuation is stable.

How is "previous" determined? A timestamp-based lock, or similar?
I really should delve into the code and try out some stuff in the testnet.
Thank you!

Can't even log in yet. I deposited some cash just yesterday and I'm not feeling too well about this.
I only wanted to buy in the dip...

I'll believe those figures and the reason behind them, but miners were not "manipulated" in any way. Miners follow money, and BCH proved to be more profitable in the short term, which is all they care about.

They were high before as well, though.
