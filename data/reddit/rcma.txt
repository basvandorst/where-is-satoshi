If you don't want to day-trade and just buy-and-hold use kraken. They are reliable security-wise but as already mentioned their technology sucks (still waiting for the trading engine update).
Sometimes it is a bit annoying I was able to buy most of the time during this week.

From the buyer who converted $5,000 to 5,000 USDT to buy at that given price.

thank you for your response ad help. 
In addition to this thread I opened up a ticket with your support team. 
I will try once you're finished with the upgrade and back online.

So I already asked this in r/Tether but I want to ask it here again. I'm not a fan or supporter of tether but I can't imagine why anyone (except Bitfinex) would use tether if they had no proof that there was some kind of 1:1 backed asset behind Tether. 
Let's not look at Bitfinex as they are basically Tether but let's look at other exchanges that use Tether as their "base currency" instead of USD or some other fiat. 
If I transfer $1,000 to Bittrex (assuming they use USDT as their base currency) they will have to credit me with USDT 1,000 (as it is converted 1:1). For doing that they need to buy USDT 1,000 from Tether and transfer them $1,000 in exchange. 
Assuming that fiat is a huge part of Bittrex liquidity and keeps the exchange alive, why would any exchange blindly trust Tether, without any due diligence, and just assume that they are backed up 1:1 with fiat? They would be putting their own operation at risk without any proof that Tether is worth what they claim to be. It would be a lot easier for them to just keep the fiat?!
Am I oversimplifying this or am I missing some important information?
I could imagine that the 100,000,000 of USDT printed are just exchanges sending fiat to tether and getting 1:1 USDT as Tether is now ready to provide a service in this magnitude. 
But of course it could also be a scam, we won't know unless there is a proper audit.

I think the ratio is remaining about the same for the last days. Always around 15% - 16% of BTC.

If you see them under your address in a block explorer (e.g.  and there is no outgoing transaction I would not worry too much.
Sometimes the ledger needs a bit time to sync. 
I personally never had that issue, perhaps someone else is able to help you.
I've seen that you already posted in the ledger help section, so perhaps they will be able to solve your question.

first wrong subreddit
second: I just sent LTC from Kraken to Bitfinex and within 15 mins I had 11 confirmations. Did you send it to the correct wallet? Perhaps the support teams of Poloniex is able to help you

Throwing in my two cents: in my opinion you are right. I "don't care" about price dips when every coin is somehow affected. While I don't own any BCH (just came into BTC a week after the fork) the rather sharp drop of BTC and the rise (some say pump-n-dump) of BCH concerns me. Right now the price of BCH is ~21% of BTC. Before the run it was around 9-10%. But I would be getting more nervous if the price moves to a 30% ratio. I don't know if there would be organic growth for BCH without pumps-n-dumps. 
But in perspective: With the recent run alts have experienced (e.g. Monero from 80$ to 400$, LTC, REP and many, many others) it was just a matter of time for BCH to follow them and rise. You can't expect the crypto market to grow and BCH to stay at the same value. But usually with other AltCoins it didn't affect BTC. This time it is different (as it was on the weekend of Nov. 11th). In my opinion people see BTC and BCH as an either or option. And for now BCH has more compelling arguments (lower fees, faster transactions even if they are only temporary / short term solutions). As long as the LN is not active this will not change and be a valid argument. 
But I don't think we can totally rely on LN to solve all our problems. We need to innovate further and to actually listen to people and their use cases for BTC. 
Only if we have a strong technology that actually benefits the use cases of the people who want to use it, then I can see a bright future for BTC. Otherwise in the long run other coins (BCH or some other coin we don't know about today) will come and replace BTC.

I'm not planning on panic selling but I try to carefully monitor the situation. Right now with a BCH BTC ratio if approx. 21% I'm still calm. 
What concerns me is the media attention BCH gets and the things said about BTC. 
I know it's still a long way for the so called potenital flippening (BCH overtaking BTC and BCH being called Bitcoin) but a little caution is never a bad idea.

It's huge and the EUR price keeps declining. Right now it is 12.1k while the other exchanges have a price around 15.3k USD which should be 12.9k EUR. Strangely the USD price keeps at 14.9k even at kraken. 
What the hell is happening there? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:07:57
I know about LN and I hope it solves a lot of our problems. Yet, I don't think that we can rely on LN as the only solution. 
What I don't totally understand because I'm missing some technical understanding: why can't BCH just say thanks for developing LN we will use it too as  BCH is technically similar to BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:13:50
A question: I have my coins on a ledger nano S in a legacy address wallet. What do I need to do to be prepared for the fork? 
If I upgrade my coins to a segwit address now my wallet says I need to send them there. In the current situation that means high fees and long transaction time. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:17:28
I don't think the worst is over yet. 
We are still struggling in the low to mid 16k areas with huge sell walls (at least on kraken).
The price around this area lacks sufficient support to overcome another attack. Right now I have a feeling it's very fragile. 
What are your thoughts? Am I misinterpreting something substantial? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:47:48
Interresting thought. 
That thought never occurred to me but you are right. We are all profit and gain oriented and to think that a party has only the interest of the larger group in mind is a bit short sighted. So there might be something true to your theory. 
Nevertheless I don't know if there are some technical barriers that would prevent the miners from doing that. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:52:02
True. I came to the same conclusion in my comment. 
We need a solution for this problem, otherwise it will get messy.
Nevertheless: every other altcoin had a huge bull run in the last days.. it was just a matter of time for BCH even if it is an artificial pump &amp; dump. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:29:40
with the current insanity going on: Give me 20000 of them I need to invest while they are cheap /sarc 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:58:59
I could imagine that we use bitcoin for high value purchases (e.g. a house, car, etc.) while we use some alt-coin (with a lower value) that overcomes those issues you mentioned for lower value purchases (groceries, restaurants, ...)
@_date: 2017-11-24 11:32:04
last time it was DASH I think?
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:59:52
It does not look healthy to me either, but we are in crypto in 2017, stranger things have happened ;) 
During the last few days before the rise of BCH it was clearly visible it was artificially held around 1150 USD. 
Perhaps, I seem to misunderstand some basic things here, but unless there is a huge inflow of new fiat money to BCH, some (alt-)coins need to be sold /exchanged for BCH. And I wonder where this is coming from, as we don't see a clear dip in BTC. 
EDIT: and in addition, we don't see (at least right now) a spam-attack on the mempool compared to last time, where it was impossible to send BTCs. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:11:31
thank you for the excellent explanation. So, by having my coins in a hardware wallet (and therefore having access to my private key) I seem to be well prepared for the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:16:32
If anyone else is interested, this explanation of the replay attack seems to be written rather easy
