Full of misinfo... Last week we topped 230000+ unconfirmeds. Now it's around 50k. Probably copy/pasted.
Only decent info in that is 'a lack of user knowledge about how the mempool'

From my exp purse is usually quite responsive in such cases. I had something worse once - i got the order (that contained the new echo dot 2gen) fine. About a week after i went on to activate the dot, but was unsuccessful. So i contacted Amazon, just to be informed, that refund was issued for that order already, the dot is marked 'lost in transit' and non-reactivateable. Cools. I contacted purse without any hope, but about 5 days after i got a question in the mail if a refund would be sufficient and what amount (!). I just put the pure dot price there and received btc next day. Contact them asap.

@_date: 2016-10-26 16:54:47
Note the 'time since last block'/'time between blocks'. As soon as those times will get shorter, the backlog will go in no time. Sometimes blocks are generated like every minute.
sat/b indication is an average of tx'es in 'backlog'(mempool). This is a median sat/b ppl used for those tx.
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:55:05
Relax for now. It's not the first time, nor the second. Big mempool happens.

there's even privatbank, an ua bank that legally accepts btc and deposits them in local currency. there's no sanctions or ban on bitcoin in ua, except if you are talking about some tot (temporarily occupied [by russia] territories, e.g. crimea, donetsk region, luhansk region). in case you ARE talking about sending money to some TOT's resident, that is borderline sponsoring international terrorism and you won't be able to have good clean fun at coachella and look people straight in their faces [at starbucks] afterwards. have a good one

You are a separatist. Everyone who had a braincell escaped. Whose who remained are scum. Sorry. I am in Ukraine now and i know what i am talking about. Pinochet is your hero? I guess you love murder and rape.
