Congrats on the new product launch, I've been using the the original Nano for a year now and i love it. You guys do good work.

Have you starved 4 times in the last 25 years? 
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:04:35
Thank you for this, should be a sticky

Hash rate is for security. It's not to process transactions. There is limited space for transaction called the block size. This does not change with the hash rate

Well you can't be worse than the last bitcoin jesus

Unemployment at an all time low, sp500 at an all time high and they are talking about lowering interest rates. What is going on? Seriously do not understand current economic climate.  Buy bitcoin. 
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:35:12
Back when bitcoins position was not as secure as it is now, many altcoiners used to shit on bitcoin as much as possible, but now that the dominance is going the other way, there is a temptation to give a big fu to all those doubters.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:44:44
Thank you that was awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:10:31
Can you point us to any online examples?

You seem very upset for someone looking at a bar chart.

But why would miners care about hypothetical lighting networks in the future when they are enjoying high fees now? 
If anything its an incentive for them not to do anything until a lighting network is live.
@_date: 2017-03-16 04:04:10
I don't understand why people expect miners to go out of their way to upgrade their system to segwit for reduced fees either.
@_date: 2019-03-11 08:44:38
What point did you make? It was too subtle for me.
@_date: 2017-01-21 03:16:05
Interesting Thanks!

yes youre right too but i think op means that it took 5 eda adjustments on the 24th to get back to profitability.

@_date: 2017-08-17 21:41:47
I think the incentive to stay with bitcoin is that it has the only proven competent developer team. Let's see how bch continues to upgrade its code before making predictions. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:57:29
And send a small amount first as a test. Double check the address and check the fees 
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:44:06
Blocks 481877 - 481881 are the 5 eda adjustments on the 24 aug
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:52:10
Me too. Very cool
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:10:12
There are people cheering not mining bch blocks for hours on end because they think temporary profitability is the only thing necessary to kill the bitcoin. 
It just gives me more confidience in bitcoin, because it is governed conservatively while the other chain is run by a lunatic, its not like jihan is consistently mining bch, hes is oscillating hash rate too, to screw his own creation for profit. its incredible. how could you trust that erratic chain with your money?
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:46:13
Hi there,  1469.99
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:56:44
I don't think that implies low fees. The important part is p2p currency which bitcoin most definitely is. Lightning is not a joke, I look forward to its continued development.
@_date: 2019-08-05 00:28:54
Can you point out where the white paper mentions "low fees"?
Edit: forgot a word
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:12:48
Bad luck buddy.  Lessons learned.
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:02:48
This is so wrong. Increasing the block size for temporary scaling would have irreparably damaged bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:24:57

The current 35K transactions in the mempool have a fee of 1-10sats. 
So which is it? are fees too high or is the mempool out of control? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:02:25
Instead of 2 weeks lets say 3 months and we find that the build up of transactions in the mempool is the unusual event.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:24:08
Yes thank you, I only noticed after I posted. Smh

Is that screenshot from coin market cap? I can't find it
@_date: 2019-04-19 06:40:13
This is wrong. Miners can hide their identities and location. There are many blocks that we have no idea who mined them.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:34:48
Yeah, whatever works for you, the point is to be far away from the influence of the small minded scumbags. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 04:46:58
Are you not able to imagine software development for improving the user interface? Do you think that it is static? 
It's the immutibility,  censorship resistance and controlled supply that give bitcoin its immense value. User interface development  will follow.
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:35:35




We were discussing ease of use. You said that bitcoin was not a suitable currency but it's hard to use. I'm saying things like that will be developed for your parents in due time. They will be just as secure and easy to use as your current internet banking is.






If you don't understand that one of these things is more important than the other, then you don't understand the potential if bitcoin and you will miss out as more adoption occurs.




I agree that it's incredible how fast the development of bitcoin has been.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:24:31
Hey Mate, Good luck whatever happens, If i were you, i'd spend some of the 200 in JD sports and be happy &amp; grateful to your parents. Say nothing of the 2.5k.
Hold until you are 18 and at that point find somewhere to live far away from the scumbags. Maybe do a college course in Waterford/Galway? something like that while you figure out what to do with your crypto.
If your parents get suspicious, tell them how you like saving and tell them about r/financialindependence.

Here is his transaction that he posted on r/btc. Confirmed 24hrs ago.

I don't know about this post but why would you and shapeshift (which I use all the time and love) sign up to an agreement that didnt invite or include any developers?
It looks like this is trying to push jihans vision of "fire core". Is that what you support? 
@_date: 2015-10-01 10:28:23
Hi there, how about this: 
Secured as in human error cannot suddenly empty your bank acc. I have seen numerous stories on personalfinace where a bank freezes a customers account after a transaction error like adding an extra zero. The burden is then on the customer to resolve.  This can't happen with bitcoin, your money is yours.
Similarly companies like PayPal or Mastercard can decide you are doing something illegal and freeze you acc. With nit even a notice like wikileaks

Roger Ver is an american libertarian... and i cant think of any connection between EU and BU?
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:18:41
Op says BU is a EU/chinese consortium, Roger Ver is one of the most prominent supporters of it and he was born in California and identifies as a libertarian.

Bitcoin isn't successful because of one philosophy, it's successful because the technology is appealing to everyone.

Thank you again nullc for explaining these things so i can understand them. 
I'm glad you post still on reddit even though i'm sure you get a lot of abuse from the crazies here. 
Keep up the good work.

First of all, Proof of work should be green because it is a true global innovation and currently the only functioning blockchain security system that has been proven. 
Energy consumption has nothing to do with the transactions on chain and so shouldn't be measured as such. Energy consumption is about the security of the chain. If the hashrate dropped to a few thousand cpus, the energy consumption would be negligible but the there would still be 10 transactions per second possible, however one guy with an asic could probably rewrite the chain. 
If we were able to scale on chain this wouldn't increase the amount of energy used, so again these shouldn't be compared.
Why is Supply in yellow? Would 21 billion BTC be green?... stupid lack of understanding of limited supply and hard money policy.
Transactions fees have been less than 1 dollar since June. Transaction times has been one block for a very long time. 8 days is just stupid... a 2017 spam attack didnt last 8 days.
It reads like one of Roger vers ridiculous propaganda charts.
