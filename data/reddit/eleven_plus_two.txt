+1 for using his logic to disprove his point. Carry on everybody, the mic has been proverbially dropped.

When (if) bitcoin ends up being used as an everyday currency, we will talk about cost of goods in Satoshis. No one will buy a Big Mac for 0.00000499 bitcoin, it will just be 499 sats. There might even become an intermediate term used.

Yeah they're a bit too easy I think. However  is probably a longer phrase or something so who knows if anyone will get it. Still plugging away though!

Less of a turning point, and more of a gradual shift. That shift will happen as mainstream adoption happens. Personally, I already talk about the price of alts in sats, so I have no doubt that people will drop the word "bitcoin" in the context of transactions. I can't say for sure if "Satoshis" will be the colloquial replacement but it is certainly a good candidate. Perhaps in the future, the word "bitcoin" will just be the name of the payment network. You pay with bitcoin, but the cost of each item is priced in other units. 
Think of the way we talk about gold. We say "an ounce of gold". Just because there are 21m btc doesn't mean we have to use 1 btc as the denomination. We could just as easily say "a chunk of btc" but a "chunk" could be 0.01 btc. Perhaps we continue using the word "dollar", but one "dollar" is not a USD. Maybe a "dollar" is the term for 100 sats, and a "cent" is a Satoshi (or similar structure at a different order of magnitude).
Only time will tell.
