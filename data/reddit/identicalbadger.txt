@_date: 2018-01-08 15:43:28

We’re not to the point yet to even speculate on the future you’re laying out. I don’t care if the bank made money off my money, I’m just saying a bank transfer is now cheaper and often times faster than with bitcoin. 
A few years ago, we were happy that bitcoin was faster and cheaper than western union. 
What’s next on the scale?

They don’t leak. They do exactly as advertised - replicate the returns on a leveraged basis for a single day. But people buy these trading instruments thinking they’ll work for the long term, too, and that’s where things break down. 
With even a little volatility, both the bull and bear funds will end up producing negative returns, even if the underlying asset is positive. 
Again, it’s not leakage. It’s these etfs performing exactly as advertised but people buying them in insistence that they should do something else. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:30:27
Not so much a bank but a match making service. Or Kickstarter for bitcoin. Where everyone involved needs to trust that you won’t abscond.

The need for a fork was discussed seriously since 2014, in order to prevent exactly the situation we have today. That was ignored because segwit. Excep segwit was nowhere near ready considering it only got rolled out in beta form a couple months ago. 
Don’t pretend this would have caught anyone off guard. This all could have been mitigated with planning, a roadmap and functional code. Could have just said, in 2015, weee going to code a block size increase at X block, but after that we should have segwit ready for the next round. 
Instead, this. Filled capacity. A hastily rolled out segwit, people complaining it’s not being used soon enough when enterprises need their own time to test and implement. And besides it’s not even in the core wallet should people want to use it for peer to peer transactions.  
Again all this could have been solved with functioning code and a roadmap. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:03:36
They can’t just reactivate it. 
They CAN send you a new agreement that says “overdraft protection will be activated unless i decline” and when you click agree because none of us ever read all the agreements were agreed to, the “service” is turned back on for us.

Yes, I’ve never paid $40 for a wire. Some banks throw in free wires knowing that it’s a service no one will use much. At least they did a few years ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:00:36
... and if those service providers materialize, they, too, will make money. And they’ll use that money to improve your experience. Just like the banks. And casinos, for that matter :)

They were only able to do that by mining far fewer than 6 blocks per hour for sustained periods of time (so that the difficulty fell).

We're back to disagreeing... kind of. Like what services are you even talking about? :)  Cheaper services than free or getting paid to use them (interest, which again, will be rising along with rates)...?
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:17:52
I don’t agree to disagree. What a lousy analogy. At the casino you’re spending money and they give you some back. Whether at the tables or in comps. Whatever. You’re not spending your money when you put it in a bank. At least not a decent bank. They’re using it to make money, yes, because otherwise those services they provide would have to cost you. But they don’t cost you anymore because the bank is able to invest your funds. It’s nothing like your casino analogy. 
But since you refuse to agree with a pretty minor point I’m happy to end this whenever you want :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:20:37
Well, anyone can inspect your transactions and verify when you obtained those coins. Kinda hard to prove you're an "early adopter" when your coins just appeared in your wallet a few days ago.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:07:54
Banks provide services.
Again, I can pay my bills without writing checks or using stamps even. They provide cash if I need cash. And, whatever loans they make, my money is always liquid to me. I'm not going to try to make 3-4% on money I need to pay bills with next week and shoulder the risk that those borrowers won't be able to make their principal or interest payment on time, because that would screw me up. Nor, for my long term cushion, do i want to evaluate whether someone will make their mortgage payments or if i'm going to have to take them to court to take possession of the house, then sell the house, then hope what i got for it is what they owed.
Thats not simple stuff. There's lots of risk involved, that can only be smoothed out because they operate on vastly different scales than individuals. 
Yes, I know about peer to peer lending, but I'd still label that as a speculative platform, not a place to put money you need day to day access to. Or money that you might need suddenly. For that, banks provide a service. And as interest rates continue to rise, we'll see at least a better reward for using their services.
Last note: fees. People are getting killed by fees, but they're using the BIG banks who couldn't care less. 
What do any of those banks offer us over small banks?
I have free cash back checking with my local bank, don't pay bank charges, get my ATM fees from other banks refunded, AND get $10 back every month from my spending. Along with online bill pay, an app, etc.  SO that's the yardstick I'm using about banks, and if anyone is getting a worse deal than that, I'd just say drop your wall street bank for something smaller that actually WANTS your business.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:24:37
Well not really. Only if the operators of those 500 supercomputers decided to spend their time generating endless SHA hashes. At literally any other task in the world, they would run circles around the network, since those chips can’t possibly do anything else. 
This fun “fact” should be put to bed already. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:07:44
Wait! Are you saying the fee (in USD terms) should be $85.61?
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:52:15
Or people look at it, learn from its mistakes and move forward. Maybe a bunch of you boycott anything replacement candidates but a lot of us want an internet money that we can microtransact with, among everything else, and plenty more will be interested once it works. 
“I heard bitcoin failed”
“Well that’s because it’s developers couldn’t figure out how to make it work for so many people and no one wanted to pay $100 per transaction to use it.”
Pretty simple explanation which doesn’t impact on any other blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:21:14
The number of Bitcoins you have to trade is mostly immaterial when fees are charged as a percentage of trade size.
Trading is a zero sum game. Its the winners extracting money from the losers. If you're not on top of your game, then you're going to make a lot of other people 200 BTC richer. At best you're just flipping a coin that you can out maneuver other people, at worst, you're consistently being depleted of funds. Sure some trades you'll make good money, and even some days and weeks will be in the green. But long term, the revenue floats to the people and machines with the best strategies and away from the people who think they can out do them.
Used to be friends with a professional options player who once had a seat on the CBOE, or however it works. But he talked me out of trying to trade like he did, emphatically saying that little people have no chance against big boys and computers. And this was probably 10 years ago. Quants were just getting started at that point.
Investing. I like that. It's the same tools (shares, coins, etc) but a completely different ballgame where everyone can win at the same time rather than at one anothers expense.
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:42:40
Kickstarter acts as the custodian while the funds are being raised and returns them if the project isnt funded in full. They also take payments through a reversible method (credit cards). 
So; in crypto land, either people need to trust the platform (your offering) or the company itself. 
Banks make loans from customer deposits. Do you really think that people will deposit bitcoin to a “bank”, lose control of their private keys, etc?
And most startup expenses need to be paid in cash. 
Much better, I think, to do this the traditional way. If a company needs funding, get them cash. Accept reversible (credit card) payments. If people with or without bitcoin want to involve themselves they can. And if you want to make a site or business that only focuses on bitcoin businesses you can. But IMO, fiat is the better tool here.  Maybe convert to crypto only after you’ve established a track record with the community. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:49:14
That’s a completely different scenario. 
But yes, if you had money you needed to “wash” or what not, and could find someone with coins they had mined back in 2011 or 12 that had not been moved after they got them from the mining pool, then that could be plausible. But those are a lot of ifs, and definitely far different than just turning in random coins and saying “I mined these myself years ago” even though their history will be clear that that’s not the case. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:59:10
You can lose to inflation or volatility. One dollar is always worth one dollar, its just what you can buy with it changes, partially based on how many have been created. One bitcoin is worth one bitcoin, yes, and what it can buy fluctuates too based on a number of factors.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:50:13
And you know which of your customers actually paid!
(Hey look! We agree on something! :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:28:03
What are you talking about? 
Segwit was just released, and there is STILL no support in the official wallet. Miners didn't cause that, you're deluding yourself if that's what  you think. The way people present it, it's as if Segwit was fully implemented by Core years ago and ready to go. It's never been the case, the rollout is just starting to occur.
SO maybe people have been begging for a blocksize increase that doesnt just wait for everyone else to "opt in" to using it? And that doesn't require significant rewriting of services that hold their money just to use it? I do applaud the services that have done the work, but I also don't hold anything against companies that have taken slower, more pragmatic approaches to deploying software given the stakes involved if an error is introduced.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:31:20
Of course there an incentive structure. I’ve said so plenty of times. And I’ve outlined what they can do that I can’t. I don’t go to the gas station and get upset saying I should pump my own oil. I don’t swipe my card at the movies and say dammit, I should have paid cash - it wouldn’t save me anything. And I’m certainly not going to maintain such a vast portfolio of interest paying loans that, in regular times, my earnings exceed inflation, while having near instant liquidity. I’m not doing that, no. And most the world isn’t doing that either. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:56:48
That’s why assets dip.
People think rationally about buying on dips when they feel rich. But when those assets actually do go on sale, many balk. Happens over and over. You can’t predict what other people will do in a case of a 90% loss, let alone what you will do. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:08:18
No you don’t. It’s irrelevant. My money is held by the bank, I expect them to be doing something with it to my benefit. That benefit lowers my costs and that’s great. I see zero fees. Bitcoin shifts those fees to the customers. You can’t dispute that. All you can do is point to the rest of the banking ecosystem and say “look at that money they made and you didn’t”, or payment processing fees, which are invisible to consumers. 
Take a step back and look at it from the customer perspective. And only that. Because those are the people who will eventually be adopting this. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:44:57
Since you're quoting, I'll quote as well:


Supported only by the backend by the official reference client does not constitute a full rollout, IMO. If I'm running the Core wallet I can't request one of those third party services to send coins to a segwit address, even if they support it, because I can't generate one to give to them. Apparently that will arrive in the next release, because there were (rightful) concerns that the current client would lose access to segwit coins if the wallet.dat file had to be restored. So, to me, that's beta software, not fully rolled out with all the bugs worked out.




That's malarky. The code wasn't ready until a few months ago, and it's still not in final form. There was NOTHING preventing the team from writing the code and polishing it up in anticipation of activation. Nothing at all. So lets not pretend its only the miners fault. And I'm not bashing the authors either, good code takes time, it shouldn't be rushed in the slightest. And you're saying that miners have a conflict of interest out of NOT wanting to process more transactions? Oh, because the modest increase in space Segwit provides will alleviate congestion forever? But if we're calling out conflicts, why aren't you calling out the conflict on the other side of the equation? You know, the group that's busily developing sidechain and second layer solutions to profit off of, which wouldn't have much demand if the blockchain was allowed to compete?




Yup. Updating software. Same goes for a blocksize increase? All of a sudden, that thing that's too hard to possibly contemplate (getting people to update their software to stay on the right chain) is this easy thing (getting people to update to generate segwit transactions)? Oh, and i'm sure some game theory person here would point out that "I" (theoretically) can reap all the benefits of Segwits increase in capacity by doing nothing, so long as everyone else does upgrade. IT's a reverse incentive. 


We're going to have to disagree with that. Like everything else. Services that are handling millions, tens of millions of dollars of other peoples money shouldn't roll out brand new software to production without THOROUGH testing... And that's not something you can do in a month. Sure, small services, go for it. But the big ones, let them do their jobs and do them right, meaning, first things first, don't do anything that could put your users coins at risk...
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:54:13
They allow it by default is the problem. Most banks let you turn off that “feature” if you request it. It’s just for some people, an overdraft fee is preferable to a payday loan. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:27:06
But people can inspect the transaction coming into the ledger, and the chain of transactions before that. 
And, with the IRS, the onus is on your to prove yourself. If you're under the microscope, they don't just take your word, they demand proof. And the blockchain preserves proof. If the coins coming into your ledger had been sitting idle for the last 5 years, then your story is plausible. If they had arrived from shapeshift, who got an incoming transaction from Coinbase a few days earlier, who received a wire from your bank a few days before that, that's easily documentable.
Yes, the blockchain is an easy place to hide assets. But you do so by making their history easily viewable by someone with the ability to compel all those service providers to provide documentation. And slightly less so to the plethoras of blockchain sleuths around these parts.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:27:18
Any sentence that leads with technically is sure to be BS. 
Heres a couple tests:
Go to an ATM and take out cash. Did you just get dinged for $40 or have to wait a few hours?
Now write a check Or hand the cash to someone else? Another $40 fee?
Or login to your bank and pay some bills. What’s the fee? Oh, zero? You’re not even paying postage for the checks they have to mail. 
Wire transfers are comparably expensive but after getting all the sign offs (confirmations) just get sent. You don’t leave the bank wondering if you paid enough of a fee to send your money.  Nor do you (except in the rarest of cases) see the wire you signed off on arriving 2 weeks later. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:43:03
So? Give them something to compete against. Isnt that why we’re here?
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:24:14
Even Bitcoin lost 80% of its value a few years back and recovered it. 
And only a few months ago it was $4k. It's price is all over the place because it depends solely on buyer and seller sentiment.
But fine, it's not like a stock. It's a commodity, like oil. Oil swings all over the place too, and no one ever says "well, it's game over for oil, it's gotten too cheap".
Only point I'm trying to make is one of the short term - Bitcoin is an extremely speculative asset. We just watched it increase in price 250% over a pretty quick amount of time, no reason to think it will be insulated from swings like that going the other way too.
But it's another day now. Let me catch up on what I missed.
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:19:42

Never once have I not said those services cost money. And no, bitcoin doesn’t. It’s electronic cash. It doesn’t offer interest bearing options. It doesn’t offer insured holdings. Ask that guy who bought the rezor with the fraudulent instructions. And you certainly can’t concert it to cash at no cost. 
Just because bitcoin makes or let’s you be your own bank, still just money. Not a business. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:33:41
So? Announce it far in advance. People that don’t upgrade won’t lose anything, their nodes will just run on the old chain until they upgrade. The old chain will still have some monetary value. 
Despite being almost a decade old, bitcoin is still very much beta. You can’t just install an old version of the client and not pay attention to news from the community. It should be on the users to make sure they stay up to date, that really doesn’t seem too much to ask to be part of a brand new economy. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:53:04
So all this hemming and hawing about how people are holding the network back by not using segwit and the core wallet doesn’t even support it yet? Ok. Glad that’s sorted out. I haven’t opened the core wallet in a long time figured it was there and the problem was all the other wallets hadn’t caught up!
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:05:14
Well people can’t yell at users for not using a feature that’s not even there. That’s all I’m saying. 
Except I’ll also point out that core has many developed that are employed by a centralized company specifically to further develop bitcoin as their full time vocation.  
But the real issue is point A, everyone’s pointing fingers about people not using segwit yet and the feature isn’t even there for most users. (Those who use the GUI wallet)
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:23:14
You can’t. With limited block space and ongoing competition all you can do is pay what you think will get you ahead of most people, knowing that many other people might pay more to get ahead of you. There’s no savyness if you need to make timely payments.

In 2013, it went from less than $100 to over $1000 in the space of 2 months, and a little over a year later it was in the $200 range, dipping below that even. Hell, even last year it was below $1000 at a few points, now 9 or 10 months later its 10x as expensive even AFTER a 50% haircut.
Heck, evn in October it was a $4000 asset, now it's 2 and a half times that. There's only so much new money that came into the ecosystem, if it gets shaken out then it's easy to see it slide further.
You need to brace yourself. Bitcoins history is not known for its stability, but rather being a rollercoaster ride thats outside all of our control. 
Again, not saying anything about it's long term. Only warning about too much confidence in the short term. Fasten your seatbelt and hold on.

Yup. The stock market sure sucks today compared to 2008. Same with housing. Same with Apple stock. Microsoft. Amazon.
No, SOME assets certainly die horrible deaths. But some get beaten up and unpopular, and present huge values for people willing to buy in.
And Bitcoin (along with all cryptos) are especially volatile. Seeing it return to a value that it was just at a few months prior shouldn't be a cause for the sky is falling alarmism. I'd certainly be a lot more interested at $1000 than $20,000, should both opportunities present themselves. I mean, absent a true underlying cause (a fatal flaw is discovered). 
Point is Bitcoin is hypervolatile. If it did fall to $1000, I don' think that would be the end, that it would just signal that speculative buyers had rushed for the exits and its time to start building anew.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:30:48

The GUI is what 90% of us deal with. 
I don’t hear the companies whining about fees as much as the users. We’re the ones being dinged. Companies are just concluding that people aren’t going to pay a $40 surcharge for a game on steam compared to just letting them pay the old fashioned way. 
These companies you speak of with tens of millions of funding and probably custody of far more in customer assets, their first duty is to their customers. They cannot be expected to jump and install software they dont understand yet and rewrite their infrastructure the second a new feature is released. Just like enterprises don’t install x.0 software on anything critical. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:46:00
I’m not getting hit by bank fees. It’s a net positive to me. I sure would like to see bitcoin prosper, and no, I don’t expect it to match up on a 1 to 1 basis. But I can’t say it’s there yet with a straight face. I mean, if my cell phone, internet, rent, and electric people all took bitcoin, I’d have to pay $120+ a month to do so. More, once everyone else bumped their fees to get ahead of mine.

Shop around, then. Unless you’re a business or in an industry thats plagued by chargebacks. Or your, yourself cause them to have some reason for concern. 
But even that isn’t apples to apples or even close. 
With a card, you know it’s swiped and pending. There’s a small chance of chargeback, Which hopefully you model and price in. So that swipe is essentially good as gold and even if it takes a week to get to your bank account.  
Those bitcoins?
If the fee was too low (and that’s not something you can’t tell with precision, and transactions aren’t processed in chronological order - people can spend after you with higher fees and see their spends get confirmed sooner.), so anyways, if the fee was too low, either at the time or the purchase or at any time after, the tx might never get processed,but rather linger in, and expire from, the mempool. 
And then there’s volatility.  Supposing your transactions do eventually settle, at what value will they be settling for?  After all, a lot can happen in 3 or 5 days.  Sometimes, the price will go up and you’ll see a nice bonus. Other times it’ll go down and wipe out the profit not just from that sale alone buy Potentially many sales. 
I could go on but I’ve been too lengthy already. The point is is that there is no way you can compare credit cards and bitcoin for retail transactions these days.

In theory lost coins should make the value of others go up. In reality it’s more difficult, as it’s nearly impossible to prove coins were truly lost unless they were sent to a burner address. 
I mean, any big whale could come forward and say that they lost the private key to a large number of coins. But how does the rest of the world believe that’s the case and that they won’t attempt to sell those “lost” coins when the market goes up to account for it?
Yes. Coins are lost. Probably irrevocably. But it’s next to impossible to actually prove that to the rest of the market.

Difference being that bitcoin was released under an open source license, where as apple is certainly not. And there is plenty of precedence for open source forks:
Litecoin was a fork

That only works if they have more hash power than the main chain. It's not just the length of the chain, it's how much work has been put into it. 
So they could play with their system clock and trigger several downward difficulty adjustments, then happily mine away at the lower difficulty, but then it'll reset 2016 blocks later anyways. Meanwhile if more work was put into the original chain (higher difficulty), the new chain wouldn't ever be able to be substituted back in.

Right. 
I think the "attack" people were imagining was rebuilding the chain offline, basically faking the time stamps, to build a chain with a higher block height, but lower overall difficulty, thinking that nodes might follow that chain instead (the longest chain when measured by the number of blocks) rather than the chain that had the most actual work behind it.

Difference is, companies have earnings. During a bull market, investors pay more for a slice of those earnings, during bear markets they pay less.

Oh m god. 
YOU have no business investing, or at least no business offering advice to anyone else. Either you completely don’t understand what you’re talking about, or you do understand and are just putting forth horrible advice in hopes of dissuading readers here from making legitimate sales. 
You have to be far more detached from your positions than you’re portraying. Once you’ve purchased, you’re in. You should be making your buy/sell decisions based on current value, not based on price paid. “I can’t sell that for $6000 because I paid $18000 for it” is the most ludicrous statement in the world.
For one, if you have gains in other parts of your portfolio and want to diversify those positions, you’ll achieve better after tax returns by pairing the sale of your winners with the sale or losing positions, in order to offset your capital gains.
If your broker allows your to specify specific lots when your sell (rather than just using LIFO or FIFO), here’s a riddle for you:
You own 6 bitcoins, each is worth $6,000. All were purchased in the last year (short term capital gain). And your effective tax rate is 25%
5 of them were purchased for $3000, and you’re looking at truly decent sized gains. The last one was purchased for $10000. Because of something unforseen, you need to make sales and withdraw $12,000 from your account. 
If you stick to your “plan” of only selling winners, you’d sell your most profitable coins first. So you sell 2 coins for $12k. Are you making a note anywhere that you’ve just realized a $6,000 gain, putting you on the hook for a $1250 tax hit at the end of the year?
Or, if your broker allows, you can sell one of your earlier coins and your most expensive coin.  Now, you still get your $12000 cash that you need today. But when tax time comes, you have a $3000 gain on one coin you sold, and a $4000 loss on the other. Meaning you get to report a $1,000 capital loss. No tax due. Better, you can deduct up to $3000 of your investment losses against your ordinary income (in the US), so this maneuver would reduce your overall tax liability by $250. 
Likewise for other examples. Let’s say you stock portfolio (or alt coin portfolio, whichever) is up by $20,000. And you also have an underwater bitcoin position that you got last Decembern for $20,000. You could just sell your winners (the other stocks), take your gain, and pay the IRS their $5,000 at the end of the year. Or you could sell those stocks AND the bitcoin. In order to not trigger a washsale, you’ll need to stay out of Bitcoin for 30 days. But by doing that, you’ve turned your $5k tax bill into $1250 bill instead  (20k gain - 14k loss = 6000 gain times 25% tax rate). 
This isn’t without risk, though. Specifically. If the price of bitcoin goes from $6000 today to $9750 or higher 30 days from now when you rebuy, then the gambit failed. But otherwise at year end, you have the same exact position, with more cash in your pocket (or invested) because you intelligently used the sales of losing positions to offset other portfolio gains. 
Point is, you can’t be so fixated on the price you paid. You can’t refuse to sell because of the hurt to your pride you’ll get from seeing a negative number. In fact, that negative number can benefit you GREATLY. You CAN still be a HODLER even if you temporarily and strategically don’t own any bitcoin for a short period. 
I hope this makes sense to you. And if it doesn’t, you’re certainly entitled to your opinion that I have no business investing. That doesn’t hurt my feelings even a little. But I do hope that people reading this thread find this educational enough to bring questions to their accountant, or if they’re doing their own taxes, do more thorough research on achieve the most benefit from both their investment gains AND losses. 
If you want to ask questions or discuss, I’d love to. But take it or leave it. if you’re going to throw out more insults, I promise I won’t spend any more of my beautiful Saturday on this
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:25:09
Selling at a loss isn’t a bad thing. In fact, it can be a really good thing to realize your losses, so that you can rebalance other gains without getting hit by the tax man. Assuming washsale rules apply if youre in the US, you’d have I stay out the position for 30dayw after the sale. 
This HODL at any cost mentality isn’t that great a maneuver, assuming you have other assets out there. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 11:39:27
Shouldn’t isn’t a valid term here. It shouldn’t be, but it is 
OP must have done a lot of trades in 17, and, seeing the gains at the end of the year, kept playing with the houses money (the money that was owed for taxes). Even if they. Truly didn’t know, if you’re cycling through half a million dollars, euros, or francs, it’s common sense to ask an accountant, just as almost any one would do if they, say, started a business, or embarked on any other activity that’s a huge deviation from what their income was in previous years

Not at all. I’m saying the expense of mining isn’t going to be a driver of price. If the generation price is significantly more than the cost, difficulty will rise, and if not, difficulty will fall. Prices or may move with those movements. Everything since the genesis block is uncharted territory. 
Part 2: if lightning and liquid succeed to absorbing transactions that would otherwise be on chain, then the fee picture looks less promising. Is that controversial? I could in theory send and receive a bitcoin a million times lightning, but as far as the blockchain is concerned, it’s only a single transaction.

Lightning transactions need to settle, yes. 
But if I send Alice money on Lightning, then she sends to Bob, then he sends to Dave, then he sends to Edward, then he sends to Frank, and Frank settles the transaction, there is only one transaction (and fee) that will ever hit the Blockchain. Using lightning doesn't defer fees from hitting the blockchain, it removes them.
And I'm saying that way back when, miners were a more substantial flow of new coins. Today, they're not. 
Today, miners selling the entirety of their earnings will account for around $7,000,000 US. 
Look at the trading volumes at [CoinMarketCaps]( $7 million isn't even a rounding error. If difficulty halved tomorrow, the market wouldn't go "oh my god, there are only half as many new coins entering each day, the price of all current coins should be worth twice as much".
I'm enjoying the BTC and it's sibblings have gone on sale, and I hope it proves to be as a decent investment in my own time frame, but a million that soon is just a wet dream (that's a $18 quadrillion dollar market cap, for anyone keeping track).

The point of this whole thread seemed to me that the halving will cause price pressure in a year and a half. So if bitcoin is currently at a discount now, then when it rebounds and the next halving takes effect, then prices are bound to skyrocket. 
I’m not arguing for or against the discount on bitcoin. It could be discounted, or it could still be at a large premium. Time will tell that,  it’s certainly on sale compared to the rest of this year, though. And as for the halving, the amount of coins the miners are responsible for, in terms of daily volume, is minuscule already. Them having less isn’t going to produce a sudden supply crunch. 
But if prices don’t recover, difficulty/chain security will likely suffer. Those are my only points. 
Oh, and expecting the capitalization of Bitcoin to breach a quadrillion dollars in a year or two is just insanely far fetched, too.

My bad. 
72% loss based on year-end values.
If Bitmain ended the 2017 with 100,000 Bitcoins in its wallet, valued at $13,314 each, it would have reported a book value of  **$1,331,479,000** from its Bitcoin holdings to investors.
If they had done literally nothing throughout all of 2018, those coins would be worth $3799 each, and it would report a book value of  **$379,926,000**.
Therefore, investors would have learned that the value of their holdings had fallen by **$951,553,000**. That their loss was $1.2 billion only mean that they probably started the year with slightly more crypto holdings, and the value of those holdings got hit even harder as the result of swapping to BCH. Plus the SV fork occurred on that chain which damaged things even more.
Point is, 2018 was a pretty horrific year for anyone that had steady exposure to any cryptocurrency through the entire year, whether in terms of realized losses or unrealized losses (forgetting the nonsense of "it's not a loss if you don't sell").
People who were able to add substantially to their holdings through year also got hammered, but if the price rebounds, they could see their old profit levels sooner thanks to dollar cost averaging. But that's dependent on future years. For a Bitmain, who probably entered the year with at least $1.5 billion in crypto assets, there was just nowhere to run or hide.
A lot of people here have been laughing at Jihan, as if his misfortune is solely due to supporting the minority fork. I'm just pointing out that even if he had stuck to BTC, he still would have been forced to report some extremely ugly declines to shareholders.

That only assumes that other people see value in the expenditure of resources to generate those bitcoins.
I can dig a hole in the ground and say "This hole took me 6 hours to dig, and I bill at $110 per hour, therefore this hole is worth $660", but if market forces disagree with me, I'll have to progressively lower the price that I'm willing to accept. Worst case, it turns out there was no market value for my freshly dug hole, in which case it was just a massive expenditure for no reason.
Not saying that Miners are hole diggers. But there are many more factors at play than just the rate the miners generate them...
For instance, Miners could generate and say "this cost me $3000 worth of electricity, and the amortized hardware cost is $300, labor is $300, and I need to make a profit, so $3800 is my asking price", but if there are other sellers on the market that need liquidity sooner, and are willing to sell at $3300, whose coins are YOU going to buy?
And if another seller sees that transaction and panics and says "Geez, I better sell now before it gets much lower, let me sell for $5 less than the other guy", the cycle continues.
What the miners wanted might not come into play for a while... But as they take capacity offline, difficulty will adjust as well, making their expenditure for future blocks less.
Look at the total supply. Miners are adding what, 1800 additional coins each day? And 900 around the corner? They're not delivering huge supplies to the market. Nor will they, as transactions (and transaction fees) are moved off the blockchain.

No it doesn't. 
"It's not a loss if you don't sell" is only relevant as far as taxes go. For anyone else, if you had BTC at $20,000 USD, you absolutely took a loss last year. Yes, you still have the same amount of BTC as before, but had you sold, you could know purchase 6 times more.
Of course, many will disagree and say "no, you're wrong, If you don't sell, it's not a loss". So lets skip that argument. Bitmain is a company - it's likely marking its assets to market at the end of each year. So, in 2017, it had a blowout year, selling miners, mining coin itself, and seeing the value of it's already mined coins spike up to $20,000 USD. In 2018, even if hardware sales kept up, the fall in BTC's value would have hammered earnings once marked to market. That those holdings were further diversified into BCH, and that then forked and shot itself in the foot even more, that just hurt result even more.
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:27:52
I saw notifications about your other deleted replies on my phone, but alas... They sure must have been entertaining!
Having the property of money is great. But what money is worth is another thing altogether. 
1 dollar = 1/1200th ounce of gold
1 euro =  1/1078th ounce of gold
There were times when the dollar bought more gold than the euro, and times when the euro bought far more than the dollar. This is due to market forces among many other things, that decide how much gold should be able to be purchased with either currency, even though they both have the property of money.
No reason Bitcoin is any different. The contribution to supply from miners is small, getting smaller every day, and will, as OP points point, fall even further when the next halving occurs.
Just because history has said BTC goes up, don't assume that that has to be the case. It can also be that it doesn't keep up with the next halving, and miners need to take hardware offline in order to remain profitable.
Either way, that's a year and a half away... You must know that in Bitcoin terms, that's many lifetimes away...

I get some of the outrage over the dollar and inflation; but that said, the dollar is just a transactional unit. When it's invested in anything else, or used as a store of value (ie - savings account), the purchasing power of the money invested has increased over time. The only thing time it hasn't kept pace is when it's not put to work (ie, under the mattress as actual cash).
But what bugs me about the raves about Bitcoin being a tool to counter inflation is that, while true in a strictly theoritical sense, nothing about it's history indicates that that's what it will actually do. In its few short years of life, it's gone up by a stratospheric percentage, and had several 60-80% tumbles as well.
Will it be a tool to counter inflation?
But that's dependent on a whole lot of other factors, particularly wide scale adoption, price stability and the like. And should that happen - it's price moves would be pretty boring. 2-3% per year normally, more or less in extreme times.
But that's all so far down the road. Currently, it has nearly no role against hedge against inflation and uncertainty, because very relatively few people believe it has any value at all.
@_date: 2019-01-12 17:04:30
Well, there's ALWAYS a gain or loss, the question is whether they've been realized or if they're unrealized. That applies to everyone, from you on up to the market makers, pool operators and so forth. Day to day price changes produce unrealized gains and losses.
Realized gains/losses occur when the transaction has been closed out, and are what owner generally (in the US) reports to tax authorities. 
A company like Bitmain might take a more complex approach - even if they held the same amount of coins at cost on their balance sheet all the way from 2017 through current, and therefore there was no tax event, the shareholders (in otherwords, owners) will want a fuller picture than what has to be reported to the tax authorities. So, Bitmain would have declared its holdings, along with appreciation/unrealized gain at the end of 2017 and said "look at this awesome year we had!". The year following, if they used the same method, they would be reporting an ~80% loss on those holdings. 
Whether it was a realized loss is immaterial from the investors standpoint. From their perspective (and to use made up numbers), the company they invested had holdings that were worth $200,000 at the end of 2017, but only $40,000 at the end of 2018.
And that's just from the decline in BTC's value. Since they (also) held BCH, the percentage loss was probably more severe.
So when people laugh and say "ha ha! Serves them right for all the BCH nonsense!" just know that based on price action of BTC alone, even if they steered clear, they probably still would have saw a billion dollar decline in value.

Miners mining is a given. That’s the driver of the ecosystem, it shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that they’ll have to sell off some of their coins to pay the bills. How many depends on the exchange rate. It’s all dead obvious. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:05:07
Oh it could just be that the market is not very deep and it doesn’t take much extra buying or selling activity to start a new trend. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 05:12:28
Is that what fueled the rebound then? What happens when this guy stops being a buyer? Or worse, becomes a seller?
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:07:56
Doesn't need to be more buyers than sellers, just more money doing the buying than the selling. One buyer whose big enough (like the person speculated about in this post) would be enough to fuel a rebound. 
I'm not bitching. More power to him or her, and more power to people taking advantage of their activity to sell at an advantageous price. But what I wonder/fear is that the rebound really is just because of one buyer or a very small handful of buyers.
Because then, I'd fear what will happen once the buying pressure goes away and there are still willing sellers. And even more, if that one buyer could move the market 30-40% while they established their position, what could occur when they attempt to unwind that position later on?
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:33:25
No, because they felt (probably correctly at the time) that buying that many coins through an exchange would push the price even higher overall, so this was a way to take a sizable position without impacting the market. 
Even today, bitcoin is fairly liquidity constrained.  Back then it was even more so. Most regular people like us don’t see it because out transactions are infrequent and small, but when you start talking about thousands and thousands of coins at once, you stood to impact the market in significant ways. Then, and even now. That’s why, at an exteme, people do somewhat worry about satoshi returning. Not like he’d be stupid enough to try to sell a million bitcoins in a single day, but apparently some people do think he’d do something irrational like that. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:16:26
Yup. But how else can we expect others to see value in transacting with Bitcoin it were not willing To do so ourselves?
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:11:15
Back in the early days, I wouldn’t be surprised if 80% of coins circulating (or, not in the wallets of Satoshi and a few others) ran through silk roads tumbler at one point or another. Those were the wile West times though.

This was in reply to someone asking if bitcoin could crash and questioning the relative safety of bitcoin vs dollars. That's all. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:22:04
It wouldn’t be just a bitcoin vs bitcoin cash type of thing. They share a name, but there’s plenty or cryptos without bitcoin in their names that took his concept, added on a new layer of improvement/innovation and are now competing with Bitcoin.
What would we say if he aligned with XYZ coin and said “yeah, I know i roled out bitcoin, but if I had to do it again, I would have done xyz instead”?  Because there are plenty of projects that have implented things that satoshi mentioned in the past. 
So with him back, not only would there be debates on technological issues, but many, especially pundits from the media, attempting to cut to the chase, not try to explain any thing at all, and just ask Satoshi Nakamoto(TM) the founder of bitcoin(r) for his take on the situation.  
@_date: 2017-09-24 14:48:54
Yes it does. That's called risk reward. And that's why people who took the risk a long time ago were rewarded so much. You won't see those returns. It could crash. But you still could get in ahead of even more people. 
If you want "safe" buy bonds. Get your 1-2% per year. Lose purchasing power due to inflation. Rates will go up one day and you'll earn a positive return. And you won't have to worry about 20% daily swings or hard forks or politics in China russsia the US or any of that. 
That's not bitcoin. There's still risk and uncertainty. But there's still potential for reward ahead if you can stomach that risk, which could theoretically be a 100% wipeout. Odds of that? Most of us will say 100% loss can't happen. More of us will say a 90% loss can't happen. Even nore will say an 80% drop can't happen.  And so forth. None of us have crystal balls though.

I brought an old computer back to life recently and found an old wallet on it. Long since empty, but i wanted to look any ways. At that point bitcoin was a curiousity, i got little bits basically for free by mining for a little while. And then frittered it away on sites like satoshidice. Seeing the bets I made then and thinking about today’s values, those long ago bets would have been huge sums of money now. 
Alas. I only regarded it as a curiosity for way too long !

The volatility is due to it's newness and incredibly small transaction volumes (relative to other currencies and commodities). Lots of traders, lots of speculators, all being sold that this will be the currency of the future, except there's that missing link of, no one wants to spend it!
Perhaps we should just say "Bitcoin will never be a currency. It's a value store, which you can use to cash out to the currency of your liking when it comes time to transaction"
I can't accept that. It needs to be useful to people in the long run... And I'd love to help play a part there.

OK, if you read that link, you'll note that at one point the FDIC had a negative balance. So, yes, at a time of stress, it was able to borrow funds to continue its operations.

So give me some ideas, I’ll work towards it. And I wont convert any more than the bare minimum to fiat 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:53:16
Yeah, not bashing Bitcoin per se, but anyone objective looking at a 3 month price chart would have to conclude there was a little irrationality going on, where the price went from sub-$7500 to near $20,000, and then right back down again.
See [this chart]( from [Coindesk](
Now the question is where does the market trully believe that Bitcoin should be valued? Just as the market does for every other asset on the planet (dollars, euros, stocks, bonds, land, housing, oil). And just like every other asset, there will always be people saying its too high and others saying its too low.

Most of banks income comes from originating loans, card processing, etc. 
They'll be more than happy to lend you their other depositors bitcoins so that you can spend outside your means, or so you can make a big purchase now and have predicable payments later on. 
And they'll also be happy to collect a few percent and let you swipe a card and get added protections that the vendor wouldn't normally give you, or just give you rewards later on worth a fraction of that.
TLDR: banks aren't going anywhere.  But they might add another currency to transact in.

Oh yes, lightning absolutely. I wasn’t referring to that part. Just for years literally (sorry, this account doesn’t go back that far) been seeing people who are pro-bitcoin arguing against actually spending bitcoin, even with replenishment.  
That’s what makes me groan. People saying it’s the currency of the future but unwilling to take a 1-2% hit (if that) in transaction fees to spend in bitcoin and re-up with fiat after that. We need to be leading by example, if merchants offer to take it we should happily spend it with them.

Ok. Then we'll go with that. It's impossible to enforce. At which point, Andreas Antonopoulous (who I'd tag in an attempt to summon, but i forget his screen name) said: "there are many reasons why we're not going to see regulated exchanges run Lightning Hubs"
So, absent effective compliance, he projects that Coinbase, Bitpay and by extension, all their customers won't be using Lightning to transact. Will Overstock? Newegg? Microsoft? It was the exchanges that were blamed for a lot of the congestion a few months back, and the solution to put an end to that congestion for once and for all (along with making possible instantaneous micropayments, etc), is one that they can't even adopt? According to the community's leading spokesman, at least?
Oh, found his screen name... I'm attributing quotes to you, please advise if I'm misunderstanding! :)
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:02:36
A hub is operated by an individual or entity. Bitpay will certainly have a hub. Coinbase, too. Overstock. And depending how the laws are interpreted, they could view that maintaining connections to hubs with unclear ownership or registration status is a risk they don’t want to take. 
Just like Coinbase closing accounts of people who sent coins to silkroad type markets. 
Then there’s the regulated banking sector, who already do all this - we have blacklists of foreign banks that our banks can’t talk to. And our banks can’t even transact with other banks that do transact with those banks. Since were the biggest player, the international banking system sides with us, meaning if we blacklist a certain bank, most the rest of the world does too.

As I was typing, I thought about a continual flood of hardforks, and the ramifications of that. 
Still I'm up in the air about it. 
Still, I think there should have been a disclaimer like "coinbase has no immediate plans to support the trading of coins resulting from the proposed UAHF. If you require immediate access to those coins (in the event of activation), you should move your coins to an address under your control. 
**we will make record of all customer owned UAHF coins in our custody at the time of the fork. Should a viable market exist for those coins, we will liquidate those coins over a X month period and credit each customers account for their pro rata share of the proceeds. Please update your account preferences to indicate if you would prefer USD or BTC should that event occur**

Public, yes, they're never technically proficient. But Bitcoin is one of those "investments" that the small segment of the "public" that actually owns any ought to keep themselves educated about. Failing that, we as a community should remind them, especially about bit things like this.
In the event of a fork, there's not opinion necessary, simply reminding folks that "In case you weren't aware, you now have coins on two different chains."
I would HOPE that people that run a node or control their own wallet (i.e. Electrum, Jaxx, etc) would be aware, but users who have left their coins in an exchange out to be alerted on the off chance that their exchange doesn't immediately notify them.

So. Supposing the UAHF actually occurs, what Happens to the coinage that would be in coinbases possession? I guess, because of this tweet, counbase is expecting those coins will just be "donated"to them?
Doesn't seem right. 
If they don't support the fork, that's fine, they don't need to support trading the coins on their platform. But they should support withdrawing those coins. I understand, it would take some engineering, but that seems like the what should be the more "proper" outcome. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:54:04
Right.  Just because coinbase doesn't want to make a market for it doesn't mean they should get to profit from coins that users abandon to them by leaving them in their custody. 
They could provably destroy the coins to prove they're not profiting. Or, since their system will be frozen when the fork (potentially) occurs, it will be no problem for them to make an exact tally of who has how many coins. Simply write a one time script to send those coins out, or pledge to sell over time and return the proceeds. Their current announcement is just too lazy for a company with their size and resources, especially one that manages multiple vlockchains already. 
That, of, imagine the traffic we'll see if a huge portion of their customers rush to return to the block chain, even if that likelihood is small.

There isn't really institutional grade storage. It's just math. You can store your private keys in the strongest safe in the world, but if the math used to generate that key was weak and it can be predicted, then that safe becomes useless.
Yes, storing with a custodian would provide for insurance coverage, but such an endowment could likely directly insure their private assets on their own anyways. And when you're managing $100 billion, you have access to resources and people to properly manage nearly any asset type.
Nothing in the above precludes institutions from taking positions in crypto. What prevents them is the lack of long-term track record, the lackluster reputation of the entire exchange industry, and the minuscule size of the market when taking into account the size investments they would make.
Look how much people panic about the speculation that Satoshi might dump his coins one day. It's absurd, but they do. And yes, he theoretically controls a much larger portion of the market than endowments would likely take on. But the simple thing is, in a market as small and illiquid, they can't take a position, because simply unwinding a portion of that position in the future could cause participants to panic.
"OH my god, X endowment just unloaded some of their coins, run for the door!"

Endowments and such are by no means prohibited from making investments in crypto. The investment manage of Yale’s endowment, David Swenson, wrote two books about the task of managing endowment assets. Pioneering portfolio management was written for other fund managers in mind, whereas unconventional success attempted to translate the strategy for individual investors. 
The thing you’d note from PPM is the utter lack of investments in publicly traded assets. There were some investments, but they made up a tiny proportion of the overall portfolio. Instead, Yale’s strategy was specifically to invest in non traditional assets In pursuit of higher returns. It’s been so long, I forget specific examples, but the take away is that there is nothing standing in the way of a Yale or Harvard investing in crypto and either holding the private key themselves or leaving them with a custodian, the issue is simp,y getting the manager and the rest of the investment committee onboard with the idea. 
Keep in mind that a hundred billion dollar endowment isn’t in search of “to the moon” returns. Aside from treasuries occasionally, they’re very diversified, and simply wouldn’t invest a billion dollars or even 500 million in a brand new asset class with very little history. Not because of compliance laws or regulations but because of prudence.
the size of the bitcoin market is too small for them to make those sized investments without totally distorting the price when moving into or out of a position. There have been many allegations of exchanges going further and frontrunning orders adding even more to the imbalance. 
But really. Endowments whose investments time horizon is essentially “forever” (they’ll be around far longer than any of us) take on all manner of exotic, weird investments. But they’re not taking outsized risks and expecting any one asset to move the needle that much on its own.
