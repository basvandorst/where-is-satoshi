Someone needs to re-invent the blockchain. It has so much more potential I just know it. BTC needs to see a major update, BTC 2.0. Transactions fees, slowness, all of that needs to go.

Actually don't take this advice. You'll get raped in fees and transaction delays.

Well actually the smart thing is sell everything now, wait for it to decrease, then buy it all back.

It's going up again. It's definitely crashing. Crashing means going up right?

If it makes you feel even better Bitcoin will always have a value. It's a ride on a hill. The faster you go down the bigger the momentum to go back up.

Expected since no altcoin can live without Bitcoin.

Is that why BCH is also going down too? The correlation with BTC is linear.

You have to understand that all coins have a chance of dropping down to 0 at any moment. This is how it's always been.
All of this is because of scared investors. It will recover back again. Maybe this is the lowest, maybe 1000 is the lowest, maybe 1 dollar is the lowest. It's all a possibility.

If Bitcoin falls, so do all the other coins. Not sure why people always try to attack Bitcoin.

Even if it plummets to 1 dollar it will rise again back to 19k. This isn't a stock market.

At least 3.4 Bitcoins.
