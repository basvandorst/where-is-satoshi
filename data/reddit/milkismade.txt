I see what you mean, and some investors call this (good debt) and also the other side of the spectrum (bad debt) credit cards, etc. But in this space. DYOR and your own Due diligence. Cheers.

I wouldnt say I'm adamant about sharing the same passion on things in a relationship. But I would say that your relationship should involve some mutual interest for things. Why would you be with someone that doesn't have the same interests as you?

Your hand make it seem like you’re more invested in chocolate cake then Bitcoin.

Coinbase is king in US in my opinion

+1 And I think it really depends, it's the media attention on bitcoin for myself, I get a little too far sometimes but I think it's something we can all relate to. 
I get so euphoric about a movement in price, or sudden media coverage, and later I'm the tinfoil hat wearing anarchist, running to look at my ledger stash. Relatable???

You never actually “had” the Bitcoin tbh

Bitcoin ATM, or buy it from another person.

I’m very happy with her. Lol. (Redditor for 3 weeks.)

She doesn’t actually say that, it’s just a figure of speech. The topic for her is something that isn’t relative to her daily life like, me, or maybe even you make Bitcoin apart of. We all have our own hobbies and interests, and some of us may even be a little pompous about it too.

Wow I wish my girlfriend would throw me some fiat to buy some more bitcoin.
