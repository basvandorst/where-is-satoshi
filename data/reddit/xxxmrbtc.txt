[Crypto.com]( is truly best though

No such thing as "opt in privacy"... privacy by default (Monero) is the only way.

Go to the Monero blockchain explorer and tell me who the "whales" are... or even how many whales there are.
You can't.
Tell me what wallet transactions are going to.
You can't.

You can send Monero to any BTC wallet using XMR.to

Why aren't you using Monero (XMR)!?
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:32:12
Monero IS NOT a fork of BTC... XMR is it's own secure, unique blockchain.... Dash is a fork of BTC and Doge coin. Zcash is a trusted setup (we dont like trust in crypto).

Um, electronic cash has been an idea since the 70's. Also there have been several attempts @ "Ecash" (such as HashCash)before  bitcoin that Satoshi borrowed his ideas from. Satoshi Nakamoto basically collaborated all pre-existing ecash ideas, then solved the centralization problem. Satoshi even sent the 1st ever transacted Bitcoin to the creator of RPOW (reusable proof of work) Hal Finney... cryptography has been around for a thousand years, and ecash has been around since computers. Bitcoin is a natural, unstoppable, evolution of currency with no escape. It would have happened sooner or later even if "genius" Satoshi hadn't created his peice of the puzzle (using independent computers networkly interconnected to perform the RPOW algorithms).
..... I hope this clears some things up for you.

I'm selling 5 acres of land in Hartsel, Colorado U.S.A for (1) BTC if you're intersted.

You can send monero to their BTC wallet using Monerojo . They'll never know who sent it.

Monero isn't a shit coin. 
I'm Monero,  Bitcoin,  and maybe Ethereum Classic (thinking about it,  but if XMR succeeds with Tari we won't need ETC).

BUY XMR MONERO
