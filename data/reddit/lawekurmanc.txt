I don't like Bcash too but what actually is the problem with increasing the block size?
What are the negative aspects? Todays internet is so fast, it doesn't matter whether its 1mb or 2mb. Or do I miss a point?

someone hacked into my amazon account. Amazon immidiately realized it was not me who is logging in and stopped the buy orders (vouchers) made from the hacker. I was terrified the moment I saw that. I was always thinking that such things only happen to dumb people who click every f*** ad or open every file from their spam mail, but none of this is what I do. I am very savvy with technology but till today, I really have no clue how he or she managed to get my account details.
I really can feel with you. It is a feeling as being raped (no joking here). As if someone penetrated your privacy and you have no clue whether he/she is still there or not. 
If I were you, I would contact Dropbox. Let them answer questions. Why their system didn't recognize an unauthorized access.

thats not the how it works... the number of buyers increase exponentially the lower the price gets... so around 40 USD per BTC you have a lot more buyers than at 19k. 
Easier way to predict is just summing up the order books of all exchanges and substracting that amount from it.

so how much did the hackers lost?

love this documantary. should be taught in every history class

~~2.) Let's say with 90% the price goes back to normal, with 10% it stays at the crashed level.~~
~~6 times it recovered, what is the probability that it will recover the 7th time?~~
~~that is 1-0.9^7 = 52%. So nearly 50/50 that it behaves differently.~~
~~I am not saying that my arbitrarily chosen numbers are correct, but what I wan't so say is that the probability of a different behaviour increases by time. And it's getting more likely, not less.~~

I don't think you need luck. You had that more than enough. If you do such leveraged trading, you can be 10x right. It will give you nice gains, but you only need to be 1x wrong to loose it all.
That is not investing but gambling. Just understand that you cannot foresee what will happen.
What you should do now is realizing that you are prone to gambling and that it is an addiction. Either you stop cryptos completely or stop leveraging. Leveraging will kill your life.

yes, bitcoin is not bound to anything and that is why you don't have an underlying value. it is only worth what people are willing to pay for it. And that may vary from 0 to infinity.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:26:14
hahaha just looked it up. yes, seems you are right
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:51:32
How many? I don't know.
I can only for sure say that its more than with crypto hahaha :D
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:01:49
I don't think my points are contradictory because I do not say the crash will continue or stop here.
There is a high probability that certain patterns hold true, but it is not a guarantee. In every investing book you will find that you cannot indicate the performance of an investing strategy by comparing it to the past.

in 7 years at least 7 major crashes^^ then people here complain about wallstreet and banksters

hacking is not as easy as said. Most of the so called hacks are inside jobs by the exchanges themselves
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:01:07
for the bottom?
i think it is 6k
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:15:40
You are doing two things wrong. 
1. Thinking that this crash is over.
2. Thinking that what happened in the past will continue happening in the future.
Noob mistakes in the stock world.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:37:34
yes. I assumed the probabilities are dependent from each other, which are not. So the probabilities stay the same

new to crypto but not new to investing... should have listend more to my own experience from stock trading than to any advices on reddit or where ever
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:55:37
believe me, that is not as easy as you think. Just think about this: Will the price go up or down tommorow?
you will lose money, if you don't know what you are doing. so educate yourself. an advisor has no clue himselfes, but since it is not his money, he can freely decide what to do. 
I highly recommend you starting with a few hundred bucks, like 200-300. Then you will see what the challanges are. do it for a month or two. 
in the meantime, you have learned more and can allow yourself investing more. so then you can turn up to 1000 and so on...
never go all in.
