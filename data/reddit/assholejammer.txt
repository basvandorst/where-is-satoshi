Yes I agree savings are benefical but they are classed as an outflow of an economy. Obviously people do not save as much as they should have prior to 2008, but too much inflation will hamper economic growth.
With low steady inflation it encourages people to spend, and increase Aggregage Demand. Which in turns increases employment and general demand. 
There's no clear cut line whether inflation is better than deflation. Their are costs of both. But overall I think most people agree low stable inflation is more beneficial to an economy due to the damaging effects of deflation.

They, could that's same with all illiquid markets.
There would be no incentive for a buyer to do this. 1. It would cost a lot to buy per bitcoin as a big buyer would push the price up.
2. When the buyer wants to sell his share, he would have to accept a lower price as his large sale would push the price down.

Those conversion sites do not actually allow people to buy things with bitcoins.
Rather it is the same as selling them to the website in exchange for cash/gift tokens.

The US pays back it's debt when the bonds it issues expire, these can vary from 1 month to 30 years.  During the time periods, typically every 6 months a coupon is payed to investers, as interest on debt. 
Because goverment debt is so expensive the government pays low 'interest' when borrowing, so our borrowing costs are very low in relation to GDP. Actually we are at a near record row on borrowing cost as a percentage of GDP.

The stock market can be very safe. Or very risky. 
*Risk measured by volatility, standard deviation.
Bitcoin is in the same group of stocks which are classed as risky, with high volatility.  
E.g Oil exploration companies, penny stocks, pharmaceuticals, etc. 
But not on par with stable companies such as GE, Ford, Coka Cola, MSFT, etc. The big Blue chips. 
You can't just say the stock market is risky. It depends on your risk tolerance.

I would invest the majority in stocks/bond something that will give you a solid return for many years in the future. As well as the increase in value of the assets you will receive coupon payments and dividends every year which will boost your standard of living.
Invest a small portion in bitcoins if you want to have some risk but it will not be a long term investment strategy. Be aware tho that Bitcoins have been on the news, a lot of talk about the rise etc so could well be overbrought. I made that mistake about 2 years ago when buying more silver when it approached a high of $50, I didn't think I could not loose.
Personally I have sold all my bitcoins now, I belive their will be a short/medium term correction of the price. However that's just my opinion. It could well go up to 2, 3 ,4  hundred dollars.
Again, $50,0000 invested into stocks and bonds will give you a size able risk free return every year which could be very useful as a safety net and boosting your standard of living.  
If I were you I wouldn't put &gt; $5k into bitcoins right now.

Although I see Bitcoin as having a place in future transactions theres no removing of the Dollar in the process.

@_date: 2013-04-07 14:56:25
Instead of looking at the amount of 'cash' in circulation, look first at the M0 money supply. Which is the amount of dollars in circulation. This stands at 2.75 Trillion .  M0.
The only reason we print money is not because we don't have enough money but so that interest rates remain at very low levels. To increase the amount of borrowing/investment/spending by business and consumers. 
Your reasons are totally false as to why money is being printed. The thing is people can't in the short-medium term abandon the US dollar. The US dollar recently as grown in strength against other major currencies.

Speculators at liquidity to the market, which is needed. However they are also sellers aswell, potentially causing massive swings in price. This is not good for adoption by merchants.

They are not creating new money. Only the central bank can do that. 
They are borrowing money from either other banks or deposits. They only have to keep around 20% of deposits on their balance sheet as reserves and are allowed to lend the rest to the wider market. For a higher interest rate. 
I don't see you argument on how this creates new money and is not replicable using bitcoins. As long as you have a system to lend/borrow bitcoins fractional reserve banking is possble.

@_date: 2013-04-03 23:02:32
Yes but you quote equities which have an intrinsic value. People buy those products as 'investments' and/or a real life use. 
Bitcoin has little real life use, transactions for payments is currently very small compared to the $1 Billion market capital. 
So any big money is likely to be purely speculation, which would cause dramatic price changes. 
Edit: I'm talking about short/medium term. If bitcoin becomes widely accepted, then any big money which hasn't come in would not create much volatility as the market capital of bitcoin would be a lot higher

I'm talking from my economics class. Central Banks do not want deflation becauses it enourages people to save rather than spend. 
Pehaps for small purchases this is irrelevant but for larger purchases it makes sense. 
If the currency you hold, e.g bit coins will be worth twice as much in a years time it seems sensible to delay that purchase in the future. As it will cost less in bit coin terms. 
Now with the recent frenzy and rise of Bitcoins, many people, justified or not are speculating that the price of bitcoins will rise in the future. I expect because of this many people will hold off purchasing significant items in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-03-06 08:48:53

Having 'Big money' will not necessarily be good for Bit coin. Would highly likely increase the volatility of the already volatile bit coin market.
This is not good if we want to see more merchants use it as a payment platform.      
Edit : What i'm saying is that although it may increase the price, which we all like. But may make Bitcoin less of a currency and more of speculative asset.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:32:16
There needs to be some fundamental shifts in the way we use bitcoins for that to happen. It is possible. Tho most people have a lot more confidence in fiat currencies before that happens. 
What I am saying is you can't assume this shift in behavoiur by the general public and therefore can't assume the price will rise to &gt; $1000 
@_date: 2013-04-05 22:47:07
You could take it out on margin, (Take a loan) to leverage your bitcoin investments.
Say Bitcoin goes from $100 to $200.  A 100% gain. 
If you had $100, and brought 1 bitcoin you would make $100 in profit.
Now. If you brought 10 bitcoins, 9 with $900 borrowed money. 1 with cash. 
Now when price goes up, sell 10 bitcoins for $2000, repay $900, take away original investment and $1000 profit. 
Leverage 1:10. 
Well obviously a lot more risky, so too is putting all your paycheck into it.

Yes I total agree with what you are saying. However with bitcoins a countries main currency, the yeilds for safe assets would naturally be very low, even possibly negative. Due to the deflationary pressures of bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is a differnent currency, a financial system which we live with today technically could easily operate. No matter if we are using bitcoins or abiding by the gold standard headlines like your post mentions today will still go on regardless.

Banks do not create new money when they lend. They lend the money which savers have deposited in.

No, arbitrage will cause the prices to come closer as people sell the high prices whilst buying the low prices. 
The difference is due to the amount of lag on the exchanges, the time for the orders to actually be placed causes differences in the exchange prices because peoples reactions take a while to show through for the price.

I don't see this urgent need to transfer to cash. A sale is a sale. A sale is not an account of cash payments moving into the companies bank accounts. 
Many retailers will have negative cashflows, so negative differeance in their bank account. Yet still have strong sales and profits.  
A sale in bitcoin would be denoted in bitcoin, though the total sales for the company would be recorded in dollar terms. When apple/google annonces their profits etc. It is recorded in dollars. Though these companies will have made large amount of sales in various other currencies. 
There is no need for those companies to transfere their EUROS, Ponds etc to dollars to release their results. This is true for a bitcoin sale.

If I where you I'd reserch HFT, high frequency trading. Works in a very similar level to this but on much more liquid markets such as Blue chip equities and forex. 100,000's of orders a second! 
From my current understanding they work by buying at one price say buying all the bids at $100. Then creating Asks (Sell orders) for a fraction of the price higher, say $100.01 . This forces buyers to purchase the slightly higher price. This done at such frequency makes a strong and gradual profit. (When done right of course!) Recently been quite a controversial topic.
This could be what is happening in the Bitcoin market however I'm unsure if this would make a significant profit, especially due to the comparable low liquidity compared to other markets.  However they must be taking advantage of some arbitrage opportunity if it is continuously being done.
