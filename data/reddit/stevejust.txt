Well, we do now know the range of what will be in it.  The House Bill passed earlier, the Senate Bill passed yesterday, and Democrats were given a version with hand written notes on it many are claiming are illegible.
We know that taxes are going to go up on most middle income people because they're taking away the property tax deduction.
We know because they're not recognizing in-kind exchanges (i.e., etheruem to dash, for example), that EVERY TIME YOU CONVERT CURRENCY IN THE US IS IT IS PROBABLY A TAXABLE EVENT.
We also know that IRS has gone after Coinbase accounts.
So basically, I'm trying to figure out what this has done to the ROI on a mining operation, and as near as I can tell... things are looking terrible.

Well-- lots of small time miners were using Nicehash.  And wasn't a distributed miner network verifying transactions, instead of a centralized processor controlling more than 50% of the hash rate what the BTC community wanted all along?
And so one of the leading entities decentralizing things has been hacked and lost $60+ million of BTC... money that was supposed to go to miners who might have needed that money to... you know... like pay for electricity.
And that's not something that matters in the whole scheme of things?
Well, the hell do I know then...

The only good news in all of this is that the bill actually managed to raise taxes on a swath of people that tend to actually vote.  The republicans thought they needed this to withstand the midterm elections.  When people find out that the republicans actually raised taxes on them -- that might backfire.
I say *might*, because republicans will just tell people they lowered taxes and many people will believe it without reference to whether it applies to them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:56:32
Yeah, well.
Some people were *selling* their mining power to NiceHash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:11:30
The actual people behind MtGox started NiceHash and pulled another MtGox?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:07:53
How are you mining?

[This is how it's supposed to be done.](
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:51:19
...when they do an audit, demand in discovery all of your accounts, and then discover that you accidentally omitted some, you go to jail and/or pay massive penalties?
It amazes me how so many people have bought into this idea that it is unregulatable for so long.  I'm sure people with BTC on drives will be okay, but only so long as they don't go then trade it for dollars or something else on anything traceable.
But what I'm worried about is how a NiceHash or ZPool or Multipool participant is going to be screwed if they are, for example, mining SHA-256, X.11 and Scrypt.
With an in-kind conversion recognition, which there should be, at least every single transfer wouldn't be taxable.

11/01/1998 ?
That looks like a date to me.  'Course it could be 01/11/1998 too...

Or you know... you could view the money you're paying on a low-interest rate mortgage combined with the tax deductability of the interest as more valuable than having a mortgage paid off.
It's almost like free money on the right terms.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:05:09
Very true!
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:06:03
I get that.  But I also lived in CA for a long while where, while I had a relatively high income, I wasn't about to buy a 1400 square foot house for $1.4 million.  So I spent a lot of my life wishing I had the ability to buy a home for the income tax deduction.

It's the pants/shoes combo that is dragging you down.  
I broke my foot a while back, and when the doctor took me out of the boot and told me to wear sneakers until my next x-ray, I started going to work wearing black sneakers with white soles.  I did that for a day or two until I realized I needed a better solution -- and found some all black (including the bottom) shoes.  They blend better than white shoes in work environments.

Or... if you like tax deductions.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:56:24
Technically yes, you're losing money because the taxes don't ever save you as much as you spend in interest.  But the deduction can have other uses, and it will effectively lower your interest rate to a point where the interest rate you're paying is lower than the return you could get in a normal investment of the money, i.e., free money.
TL;DR As long as the delta between what you're paying in interest can be made up for by a reasonably anticipated investment return, it's basically free money.

The boards in my machines had a greater than 12.5% failure rate.  If I could get personal jurisdiction in the US to sue them, I would.  They sold me a bunch of defective-ass merchandise.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:32:08
I received 44 at the end Nov. 2017.  Sent a whole bunch of boards back and am still waiting on them.
Meanwhile, the machines are basically worthless at this point anyway, and because I lost all that hash power, it really kind of screwed us.

Love your analysis and appreciate you taking the time to type it all out.  I'm just trying to make sense of all of this.  The train is leaving the station so much quicker and earlier than I'd imagined, and I'm trying to figure out how to catch up.
So much of the analysis is limited to 140 characters, it's nice to have you take the time to explain your thinking.

Totally understand the positive feedback loop.  No question.  But I thought Friendster had a competitive advantage vis a vis Myspace.  And then Myspace became top dog until Facebook came and made them both irrelevant.  So the positive feedback loop didn't work for Myspace in that three-way race.
You might say that Bitcoin vs. Litecoin vs. Ethereum vs. Dash, or whatever is *different*.  But one too many hard forks, or a feeling that too much of the Bitcoin network hashing power is in the hands of too few could cause a mass migration away from Bitcoin.  Probably hard to conceive right now with prices so high, but it's always a possibility.
I'm sure there was a time when people on Stumbleupon or Digg thought they would be around forever.  And look where we are. 
I am just trying to understand all this, because we're in the middle of an exciting time I don't think anyone could possibly have answers about what comes next.  But that's not going to stop me from asking.

I think most people DO understand the potential of blockchain.  As far as Bitcoin goes, though, is it going to be the Facebook, the Friendster or the Myspace of blockchain technology?
Will the cryptocurrency of the future be based on SHA-256, X.11, Neoscrypt, Ethash or something yet to be developed?
As for the value of gold before metalworking... I'm not sure it had a value before it cold be made into pretty, shinny things.  Did it?  I might be wrong.  I know gold was valuable before it was made into coins, but I'm not sure it was ever used as money prior to it being made into objects.
Could totally be wrong.  Would love some insight if you have it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:44:03
My initial reaction was it must have been [due to the amount exceeding $10k.](  But here you're saying it's relatively small sums.
If it was less than $10k in aggregate, this is very peculiar and interesting -- in that it is disturbing, and worthy of further examination
If it was more than $10k in aggregate, then it was totally to be expected, part of PNCs' Bank Secrecy Law compliance and no big deal.
So you've really created a cliff hanger here.

This quotation is... simply false.  
1) It happens almost every year around Christmas time.
2)  Beanie Babies, baseball cards, any collectibles.
**Part 1**
When I was younger, my brother had a job at Toys R Us, in about 1982 or so when the **Cabbage Patch Kid** phenomenon hit.  It was the first time in my life I became aware of people getting into fights over toys, people breaking into cars for Toys, etc.,.  Anyway, getting a Cabbage Patch Kid was a big deal, and because my brother worked at the store, he decided to buy one and flip it for the tidy $300 profit that could be made.   (Back in '82, that was a lot more money than it sounds like today.)  Woman who came to pick it up gave him a sob story about she had one for her daughter and it was stolen from her car and how her daughter's Christmas was going to be ruined, so he just gave it to her.  A few years later, the hot toys were Transformers, where during Christmas of circa 1985 or 1986, you could flip an Optimus Prime or Megatron for triple digit profit margins.
I told this story recently, and some friends of mine told me they knew people who every year try to identify the hottest toys that they could flip on Ebay for a profit.  They'd buy out Toys R Us.  If the toy wound up being a dud, they'd just return them to Toys R Us.  If it didn't, they'd make a bunch of money.  Now Toys r Us is bankrupt.
But toy speculation was real, apparently is real from what i understand, and literally apparently happens every year.
**Part 2**
The only way someone could say no one alive has seen a good becoming money is if someone is younger than the Beanie Baby craze.  When that hit, it was bananas.  I just looked, and has, literally, 55 readers.
We could talk about baseball cards, or Garbage Pail Kids, Dutch tulip bulbs, or the North Sea Bubble.  
There's nothing that separates bitcoin, intrinsically, from any of this.
Gold isn't the greatest precious metal on earth.  But its use for tooth filings or electronics for its conductive properties is undeniable.  
What if I told you I was going to start paying you for doing your calculus homework?  
Does that make any sense (unless, maybe, I was your parent trying to incentivize you)?
But I have watched things like baseball card speculation ebb and flow, and the rise and fall of beanie babies, and have realized one thing.  There's a ton of money to be made.  As long as you understand you're playing a game of musical chairs.  
Just make sure you've got a place to sit when the music stops.
