What kind of boost to btc do you think it will provide? Subtle or significant?
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:57:58
Has it ever broken 20k?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:39:50
Remindme! 1 month 26 days 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:32:15
Except since the middle of December.

@_date: 2018-01-17 19:17:55
We'll, it's below $10k.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:06:06
You're right, maybe it'll hit 10k first
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:43:29
When will that happen?
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:56:37
Remindeme! 2 months
Please remember this in a couple months when everyone's worried it might drop all the way back down to $20k
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:05:05
Remindme! 1 week

@_date: 2016-12-03 20:35:33
Why "-liberals"? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:21:48
So back to several weeks ago? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:58:04

20k seems forever away
