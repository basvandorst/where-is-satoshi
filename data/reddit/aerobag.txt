Note how the opposite accident is impossible, there is no way for a bitcoin to crash into Fiat. To the moon!

It doesn't say how they did it exactly. Did they guess the password because it was one of the common default ones like "123456"? That's hardly hacking. On the other hand, if they used a custom made chip card with some code to make the atm overflow or anything of the sort, then that's hacking. It would be interesting to know.

Did you try checking out as guest and creating a new account during check out when offered? It's the only way I could get it working.

weird, I had to checkout as guest and create an account on the fly and it worked...

I was surprised to see that in HK, banknotes look different depending on which bank printed it. They are all worth the date, just look different and says which bank made it

If you find a pawn shop that will understand what Bitcoin is, figure out how to keep them and trust you that you're not scamming them, I'd be curious to know how you did it. Besides, when they realize how much it becomes worth it would be easier for them to tell you they lost your btc, sell a fraction of them and refund you for however much you pawned then for before the raise in value. Let's just say I'm skeptical :)
