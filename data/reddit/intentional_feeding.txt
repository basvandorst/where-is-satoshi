the whole blocksize conensus thing reminds me of the last arc of Hunter x Hunter where they needed to replace the old man, but to elect someone new they needed at least 95% consensus among hunters, of which there are countless and whom, if you're unfamiliar, are unruly, hard to track down, and supremely indifferent. its just as funny too.
hearn was a big concern for me. now that his impulsivity has been excised, im confident this whole thing will work itself out in the end (though i'm still staunchly against the censorship here). the core devs aren't stupid and hence won't sacrifice the immense economic/censorship-resistant potential afoot for whatever reason.

the way i see it: right now is a ripe opportunity to show a nation of people the benefits of digital currency alternatives. the meltdown causing terror in the streets was caused by central authorities. these same central authorities have prevented you from moving money out of the country. "hey greeks, just fyi for next time, bitcoin is borderless and not subject to central authority. try it out."
i'm hoping -- and i think the hope is -- that we achieve some sort of mass awareness, i.e., so *next time* people will know to use BTC, that people around the world, too, learn that this same problem can present itself in any country and that bitcoin is a solution. i don't think any rational person expects greek mass adoption *right this instant* -- not only is it plain stupid, it's logistically impossible.

 But being realistic and making sense doesn't equate to the right course of action.


The need to change the protocol this drastically has never arose while the ecosystem's been this large. Were watching the political history of bitcoin unfold.
You're right, there lacks a formal process for decison much akin to say voting in an election. An explicit process like this may need to be built into the system in the same vain as the us political system evolving past simple majority rule into a representative democracy. Its actually kinda of cool. Gonna write a book  in the future about the governance of bitcoin.
Hopefully we don't make the same mistakes the u.s. forefathers did.

This is but one side of the coin. The other side, the side I believe most are taking (but not all, yes, some are trying to profit), is that there is a lesson to be learned here, not only by the Greeks but by the world abroad: your money is not your own as long as a central authority governs it. The natural question then is to ask, "what money can be mine and only mine, that won't ever be subject to the bullshit going on in Greece?" The answer: a decentralized, global currency, i.e., Bitcoin.

Precisely. For a long time now, we've reached the floor of non-bitcoin fintech. Fees/times/transparency/etc. can't get any better without changing the banks that these products rely on. Despite all these "disruptions", banks, feeling unchallenged, still charge out the ass and don't give a shit. These "new" fintech "innovations" are the definition of fully diminished returns; grasping at straws.
Now that totally independent, new rails have emerged, financial entities are scrambling. They're composed on the outside, but screaming internally.  Trying to make sense of their violently shaken worldviews, they come up with "blockchain, not bitcoins" recognizing they need to adopt or die but can't look weak. 
This represents the first time, I think, that traditional financial services have taken Silicon Valley seriously. Imo it's too late. Now time for some juicy multi-trillion dollar market share.

i thought about getting a partial private key tattooed on my taint or behind the sack; memorize the rest. pretty great security, even if you have a lot of traffic down there.
perhaps some day there will also be non-permanent (or permanent, if they fancy) QR code tattoos for strippers and hookers. small "powered by ChangeTip^TM "at the bottom-right hand corner of the code. scan the tramp stamp area to tip, scan the tits to tip,... big counter on wall that shows how much the current stripper is getting tipped.
sounds like a fun, novelty bitcoin business. i'd call it BitTatts &amp; Strips -- speakeasy, tattoo parlor, bistro, and strip club all in one.
changetip qr code stickers &amp; non-permanent tattoos actually sound like a cool, viable idea. probably inexpensive, too, making such a feature worth it perhaps. un-acquired user scans the sticker or tattoo, brings up changetip website, connect social app, if new user then give $5 in free bitcoin, ask to tip the sticker... whether they tip the sticker or not = user acquired.

Oversimplifications, but for what their worth:
1. Sidechains can either be "merge mined", where failed Bitcoin hashes are "recycled" to hash the merge-mineable sidechain, or have miners dedicated to mining the sidechain only.
2. Reduction of liquidity as coins are "burnt" to the sidechain could impact price positively. I don't think that effect will be significant unless sidechains become widely adopted. The real bread and butter of sidechains is that they augment the programmability of Bitcoin. And so in virtue of new, never before possible apps, Bitcoin's overall value technologically is likely to increase.

Does not necessarily imply ChangeTip will do the same. You're going to need a much bigger sample size to make even a correlative claim about human/corporate nature.
Another hole in the initial article was that it assumed that this was the only way ChangeTip could monetize, which is patently false. There's literally an infinity of products/features/services that they could develop to monetize. With $3.5mm, they've got a long while before monetization is a serious concern anyway. They could develop these monetizable products/features/services in the meantime.

Privacy is such a core tenet of Bitcoin. I'd argue that anyone who thoroughly learns about Bitcoin will more likely than not see how it better facilitates privacy protection than anything we've seen before. In learning about Bitcoin privacy, they'll also learn how to use Bitcoin privately as well, i.e., sending/receiving from naked addresses instead of using a centralized service like Coinbase to transact. I'd also argue that you can't use Bitcoin, without learning about it.
As such, I think those most concerned with privacy will move off centralized services like ChangeTip (even after being onboarded and introduced to Bitcoin by these centralized services) once they inevitably learn more about Bitcoin. If they're so concerned with privacy that they're willing to forgo convenience and still want to tip, they can easily tip with naked addresses. Frankly, most people don't give a shit about privacy with Facebook, Google, the NSA, knocking at the door already, asking for much more than 250 bits or $10. 
There is a solution to this privacy problem without needing to ruin people's lives with tin-foil speculation, let alone speculating without giving the accused the opportunity to chime in. Since there's an easy, non-ChangeTip way to tip and preserve privacy using Bitcoin, it just seems like ChangeTip is being scapegoated for a bigger social problem – the general disregard everyone (companies and consumers alike) has for their privacy. Heavily ideological people are lashing out because it's easier than getting together and boycotting Facebook until it stops selling data. In comparison to Google, it's easier to "set ChangeTip straight" since it's so young.

@_date: 2014-12-19 01:33:50
Just FYI, I had another post pointing out how this thread was being downvoted by trolls/shills earlier. Mods took it down for undisclosed reasons.
I can see why they would want to delete, since it was a meta thread of this thread, but it had a lot more traction/visibility than this thread (the whole point of the meta thread being that ChangeTip deserved to visibly stand against their accused) and had contentful discussion in the comments section. I think someone reasonable would value that thread as an exception to a moderator clutter-clearing rule.
This thread needs visibility. ChangeTip deserves to tell their side of things, especially after a significant call-out like yesterday's article.
The fact this thread was downvoted earlier suggests to me that someone thinks ChangeTip might actually be pivotal in Bitcoin's success. The link is topical to Bitcoin and is part of an ongoing controversy that deeply impacts the sub. The only remaining reason to downvote would be to silence and censor, which is not conducive to progress, let alone an open forum (something I think we all want this place to be).

the problem is tipping other people who arent into bitcoin. 
i have an address set up on my page for those who are familiar with bitcoin and are staunchly against any sort of centralized service to use. at the same time, i have my tip.me link set up right next to it for those that want to tip but dont have a clue what that jumble of letters/numbers is or what to do with it.
once theyre initiated into the community, naturally learn about the privacy benefits of bitcoin, and individually judge for themselves what method of tipping they're comfortable with, they then can easily use only raw addresses for their tipping needs, if that's what they choose to do. changetip's merely a gateway in that sense, not a be-all-end-all method of bitcoin tipping.

if they're gonna offer the ability to buy bitcoins, they need some sort of KYC method, otherwise look at ripple and FinCen. rather than fill out forms and painstakingly provide picture id like coinbase, circle, etc., apparently its ok for them to just have the facebook profile on file (which, like mentioned, would be pretty neat).
i see no problem with this. for those that want to get into bitcoin and changetip's their first point of contact, this is  a great feature. instead of kyc forms, just log in to facebook -- easy. i doubt anyone is gonna use their ability to purchase $25 worth of bitcoin to begin their darknet drug business or that if by buying a mere $25 worth of coins on changetip, the NSA will all of a sudden begin passing around that bitcoin newbie's nudes.
and its not like anyone who staunchly values privacy is going to be using changetip to buy bitcoins anyway, let alone use changetip at all. so what's the problem again?

these previous rounds were unannounced? that may be what im missing.
but wait. those previous rounds should count for 2013 and 2014, technically. technically still, for 2015, they only raised 75 million. yeah, we can say that were about meet 2014's total funding b/c those previous rounds weren't disclosed, but that's not completely true.
what would be true is to find out the dates of the older rounds, add those values to the appropriate year, then add 75 million to 2015's total so far. still, we're a bit a ways away from matching 2014's total.

i've tipped a lot of artists on twitter, even famous ones. those that respond usually respond with curiosity and/or gratitude.  and they can most likely block the changetip account if ends up being upsetting to them for whatever reason.
also dont artists make 11 cents or whatever per itunes song purchase? in march, the average tip amount was about $0.91, almost 9x that amount. also, the potential to cut out middlemen like itunes, spotify, etc. to get the full $2.50 per song should be enough for a reasonable artist to support changetip and its users or even just the idea of bitcoin.
also, sure as heck beats the promo spam that probably comprises 99% of their soundcloud inboxes. this just inspired an idea: paying small micropayment amounts for artists or A&amp;R reps to listen to your promo.

i was thinking more along the lines of a couple dollars, but i imagine there'd be a market to it which could jack up the value to $50/min if that's its true value. i imagine a famous artist or label A&amp;R's time is worth much more than a couple dollars a minute, so its more likely that $50 could be closer to the true value.
still, even $200 per promo listen would be a good investment if your music is actually good and could potentially be worth millions. $200 per listen would also incentivize better quality tracks/disincentivize spammy/generic tracks hitting the ears of the A&amp;R reps, perhaps increasing the quality of content across the industry board. and for the casual users, we might also see a reduction in spammy comment sections.

thanks for the solid proof.
it seems like he was doing his own thing until nick realized that what charles was doing wasn't in line with changetip's code of conduct/vision, whereupon nick reigned charles in. have there been any other charles incidents since then?
also, i'd question whether a contractee (versus a permanent employee) could be a figurehead of an entire company. 
unless there have been further charles incidents that nick has ignored (i.e., allowed), you still dont have an argument. the rogue actions of a contractee != a company that is literally satan, should have its name publicly dragged through the dirt, and is "making the entire internet worse for everyone".

I really have no clue either, mostly because i don't know what changetip has planned for when its time to pay the bills. 
What I can say with utmost certainty is that just because something isn't obvious, doesn't mean it isn't there. That's undeniable logic.
Because it isn't obvious to you or the others who value privacy how they will monetize, does not mean that there is only ever going to be 2-3 ways to monetize. Does not mean that necessarily they will be selling data.

speculation. and if youre talking about the minions, etc., those are actual components to the service.

Report him then. And if you receive no response, then reddit thinks he's in line  and hence isnt a problem for them or their users.
Which brings me back to the underlying flaw of this entire debacle: just because you value something or like things done a certain way doesn't mean everyone else does or needs to, too.

just started an autoinvest.
a few suggestions, i think more investors would be willing to put money down for the riskier autoinvest allocation profiles if the minimum amount necessary to invest decreased as the riskiness of the profile increases. so for example, instead of the 1 btc for the riskiest profile and the conservative profile, it would make more sense and be more attractive to investors if .5 btc were the minimum investment amount for the riskiest profile. i feel comfortable putting down 1 btc on the conservative profile, but not for the more risky profiles. i would be conformtable putting money into the riskier profiles if the minimum amount was less. not sure if .5 is the optimal value, but you get the idea.
also, maybe an autoinvest feedback option? as loans are repaid, feed that money back into the autoinvest profile? if that could be done, i would absolutely love the option of being able to feedback only a percentage of returns, so that way some returns get re-exposed and the rest can be saved for manual investing, realizing, etc. i.e., more diversification.
another idea i had: being able to choose to invest slightly more in better rated borrowers for autoinvesting. so instead of giving say .1 to A's, B's, C's, etc. alike, have an option where i can choose to give, for example, A's .2, B's .1, C's .05.
and yeah, a way to edit the allocation profile once the autoinvest campaign has started.
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:20:01
I'm certain everyone would take 25 cents over traditional, valueless ads any day. Its user acquisition all the same, except that one actually has upfront value for a potential user. Would you prefer just plain ads on news publications, popups, etc.? A lot of peoople call that spam too.

i sold the majority of my holdings when the PR front of the blocksize war began (a la the guardian article on monday, etc.). i once had unshakable faith, but according to some core devs, what i expected for its future was completely wrong and not as advertised. i can't even work in the same way that i used to -- cheery that i was changing the world -- b/c apparently bitcoin is just a $3/4B VC funded hobby. 
community is being censored now with no recourse. and despite the loud dissension against a scaling network (a piss poor, FUD-y response to the philosophical question of identity), an XT block -- an "altcoin" block -- is confirmed to the main chain. the irony. 
as a community -- the strongest pillar supporting the bitcoin movement -- we've clearly fractured. 
bitcoin is not in a good place right now. i'll maybe rebuy once the debate is resolved (if ever).
@_date: 2015-08-18 21:16:53
there are very clear problems with the code's governance, community censorship is happening unapologetically and without recourse (censorship in favor of crippling bitcoin's current momentum). bitcoin "splitting into two" will be the new media meme.  how can anyone take that seriously? not to mention bank's trying to capitalize on the technology in any way they can without having to concede that bitcoins are necessary.
i think bitcoin will work and will win. just not any time soon and without price tanking to $100-200. we're on rough waters where i have the option of pulling out until waters are calm again, if they're ever calm again.
worst is bitcoin can't scale and becomes worthless, which is more likely than you think insofar as there is no model of governance by which to organize consensus.

the anti-changetip brigade does have a point, though -- that that 1% won't be sustainable unless they have massive traction, a level of traction which, although they're making progress, is a bit a ways off i'm guessing. they will need some other way to monetize until they achieve that level of traction -- i too am curious to see what that will be -- but its not, "by necessity", selling our data.

I like how creative this idea is but the mining difficulty approximating price is a significant assumption. Also, not everyone would be motivated by the value of bitcoin when casting their vote -- a significant minority, I think. Perhaps negligible.

i have an autoinvest going on 1 BTC, just to test it out. the most conservative profile. it has invested .01 in about 40 ventures so far, spanning most of the currencies. 19% return so far, 2 past due accounts.
i wont even look at anyone with below a solid B rating, insofar as the lack of recourse. local bitcoins traders, people with verified income, and those that take the time to explain their venture in detail including what happens in case of failure turn out to be good borrowers. keep in mind this doesn't *necessarily* mean they are good borrowers.
autoinvest is a great way to find people who pay back their loans -- i typically follow them and manually invest in their next ventures if autoinvest doesn't invest in them first. i spend a lot less time researching good borrowers as a result without any hit to returns yet. obviously you block and comment on the duds, but keep a list of the good borrowers (just dont get comfortable and over-lend with good borrowers as they may be trying to establish trust for a large heist down the road).
for me, BTCjam is nice b/c it requires low maintenance but you get decent returns ( or at least I do). i imagine if i spent more time manually investing, returns would be greater, but i cba.
edit: when i visit to check on my autoinvest, i also buy stupidly cheap notes with high returns on A and B borrower ventures. these are real people we're dealing with and sometimes payments come late. but people on btcjam are super wary of scams, hence are super impatient, and will post notes for cheap to cut losses and move onto the next thing because they assume the borrower totally sucks. their loss is my gain.
it should go without saying, but dont buy any junk b- and lower notes.

please use a different word to describe this -- perhaps "hyperbole" or "overexaggeration" or "politcking".  i get that it's your right to use whatever words you want, but for most people, saying he's "trolling" comes off as much worse than simple/typical hyperbole or overexaggeration. albeit connotatively, "trolling" suggests malice and i don't think anyone believes that jeff is being malicious (let alone trolling) -- perhaps a little overzealous in advocating his position if what you're saying is true, but certainly not malicious. "trolling" also warrants discreditation and i think, for a constructive conversation, jeff's credibility is important not to challenge, even if casually or inadvertently.

regardless of who they are, they are looking for return on investment on the order of 5-10x and nothing else. otherwise, altruistically, that $20 million would've been "donated", not "invested" (but you can look to politics to see how even $20 million donations exert influence).
if its the case that the core bitcoin protocol can change more easily than expected, then the technology they're trying to peddle (meant to augment the core bitcoin protocol beyond its difficult-to-change capabilities) may not be as profitable as expected, which is obviously problematic for the investors. and with so much pull the   blockstreamers have on how the core protocol is developed, changing the blocksize limit is easy to stonewall until the ecosystem is forced into adopting their technology (which at that point might only be half-baked at best).
i personally dont trust any of the core developers -- everyone's getting paid by someone. i think we need to educate more people about the concepts relevant to digital currencies (economics, comp sci, cryptography, etc.), i.e., more core developers to decentralize core development, i.e., so consensus actually means something beyond the wants of 12 or so people representing the wants of 3 or so corporate/otherwise vested interests. as a layperson, i'm forced into either buying into hearn and whoever he represents or the blockstreamers and their investors, where either choice is orders of magnitude more risky for me than say one camp or the other representing myriads of informed interests stemming from a greater number of people having a valid opinion on bitcoin development. core development risk, which we're greatly experiencing now, can be decentralized too.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:29:45
and i'd still say they're right. and if bitcoin can't get its shit together, forget about any sort of moon for any digital currency. the level of success we're experiencing now is predicated on bitcoin's first mover in addition to the ecosystem's so far impeccable integrity. bitcoin and digital currencies in general lose everything if the protocol cannot scale and turns out to be unreliable when its needed the most.

this is the core problem with your camp's logic. come up with a universal set of viable monetization methods, including those that haven't been thought up yet, rule them out one by one, and only then will any rational person buy into the assertion that changetip's monetization scheme, by default, is selling data. 
spoiler alert: you can't, because its impossible for anyone to think up *all* of the possibilities. and if you can't rule them all out because you can't think them all up, then you can't say certainly that their only option is to sell data.
facebook fucked you guys and didn't call you back -- that doesn't mean you take it out on the little guys, especially insofar as you have no clue what their plans entail. and in the startup game, i figured people would give a little more credence to entrepreneurs' creativity in solving problems, i.e., coming up with novel monetization methods. it's happened before, absolutely no reason why it can't happen in this instance (i'd go so far as to say that there are reasons motivating them to find a creative, non-data selling solution, but i'll stop here).

i was hoping someone would stop by! 
the main thing for me about the feed is commenting. i see every comment anyone ever makes which is annoying and uninteresting. to make things worse, the commenting blocks are much larger than the blocks that say "you received payment" or "listing was activated", so i've got go digging for those.
also, it'd be nice to see "missed payment" blocks, highlighted in red perhaps, for borrowers that haven't that missed a payment.
i love your guys' platform, but i want to say that the UI has *a lot of room* for improvement.
also, the workflow for purchasing notes is clunky. i wish there was a button on the listing page that would automatically look up any available notes for the listing. also, after purchasing notes, it'd be nice to taken back to the list of notes for that listing, rather than having to search for it again.

there's has been an affinity to denounce the currency while praising the technology. obviously and necessarily, they go hand in hand, so that's pretty misleading.

the emergence of digital currency proper into the mainstream is at a fragile point right now, and perhaps for the next couple of years. should bitcoin -- the best digital currency -- fracture, why give any other permissionless digital currency a chance if the best and longest lasting turned out to be unreliable? its not about the handful of people who make up this community simply denying altcoins (although i think our denial is, currently (to be fair), well-warranted)

i personally think a Fedcoin + Bitcoin is the most likely scenario for the future.
i forget the statistic but only 11% of cash is physical right now? it's clear that an entirely digital money system is the direction we're headed as a society. although it cannot be bitcoin -- governments will want some authority over their monies but will still want most of the benefits afforded by digital currencies like bitcoin. hence, Fedcoin will be born. 
they may try to outlaw bitcoin to eliminate competition and maintain control over how people use money, but bitcoin is and will continue to be un-outlawable (for reasons obvious to us all by now) and will hence forever exist. they may let bitcoin coexist without the trouble, inconvenience of it being illegal. in either case, its easy to see a bitcoin + fedcoin world.

@_date: 2015-07-21 21:43:21


no doubt. and if it makes you uncomfortable, to each their own. there's a fine line between expressing that discomfort and generating FUD (not accusing you of the latter), but people are quick to take to FUD. 


a decent shot in the dark, a bet, at most. not a "conclusion".


that's because the last time we treaded that thin line between expressing discomfort and generating FUD, the community was on the verge of burning the business down, premised on the mere possibility of selling data. not to mention that almost anything posted to this sub about changetip -- and these aren't trivial announcements for the record -- is downvoted immediately and aggressively, sometimes with harshly negative comments, just because "someone said changetip is selling our data, boo!!". to further illustrate my point, all of my posts in this thread are being downvoted despite being topical and substantial.
remember this shilly article?  the company responded quickly and pretty decently but the protip brigade downvoted the company's reply as if their lives depended on it never seeing the light of day. was literally downvoted into oblivion. seems fishy if a conversation cannot even be had over the issues...
i'm just trying to keep perspectives clear.


other than they are a good tool that lets newbies easily actually play with some bitcoin rather than read about it only (which has the same affect as reading about VR versus playing with VR for the first time in my opinion), no. i'm just staunchly against this indiscriminate corporate witch hunting mentality that seems to be festering here. i get that there is a large libertarian presence here, but early stage startups trying to bolster the ecosystem around a cool technology should be at the bottom of the anti-corporatism hitlist. its toxic for industry progress and contrary to whatever interest they have in bitcoin (i.e., your para-governmental money means nothing if the network can be easily attacked or there are very few people who value the token). 
and these aren't well-insulated mindless-of-their-users robotic c-level officers people are making feel like shit, these are hobbysts, enthusiasts, with modest, human dreams of being a part of the next internet (born too late to explore the moon, too early for mars) or whathaveyou.
we get it. selling our data is not ruled out as a possibility, despite their being comments from the company's leadership that this will never be the case. in doing so, they've wagered their reputation to users, that should count for something. i mean look at reddit -- "bastion of free speech" then "not a bastion of free speech". reddit didn't spiral into death, but that reputation alexis and co wagered on maintaining that bastion of free speech ideal resulted in a significant exodus of users to other platforms like voat when they went back on their word.
selling our data is not ruled out as a possibility. just like it isn't for [insert most other bitcoin startups here]. why is changetip special other than it was the one of the first ways to easily spread bitcoin and the sub is overrun with traditional finance-sponsored shills with an agenda to disrupt our ecosystem's progress?

How would a convention be any more centralized than the small group of computer scientists currently controlling Bitcoin development? Explain to me why you think Bitcoin isn't being planned as a function of the development work that has been done on it since Day 1. I get that the network accepts or denies changes on its own, but ultimately its them telling us what's going on, why we should update, etc. For small changes, this is ok, as the alternative would just not be feasible for something that has become this big. But large scale changes like the subjects of current discussion? Not so much. We need careful deliberation and decision making, with the same breadth of input as the many academic disciplines that converged to form Bitcoin.
If we start taking random shots and hoping they hit, it's much more likely we'll miss. Steady aim, organization is key. We know it's key. We know it's key insofar as we're comfortable with dev mailing lists, GitHub, etc., and the current organization of core devs more or less steering the helm. I'm saying extend the discussion a bit further out to experts in key fields to make sure all bases are covered, *in such a way that allows the discussion to all be in one place, all laid out, with the mandate of some sort of consensus reached by the end.*
What's the timetable about when a decision needs to be reached about the issues the ecosystem currently faces over the protocol? We know we need to reach one but how long do we have? Nobody knows. Who's an acceptable authority on the block size matters? Certainly not only the core devs. Then who else? The miners want a say. None of this is defined. No organization. What exactly are the issues? There are many different proposals being discussed on many different forums, mailing lists, and IRCs.  Which are the most popular? *We can't even gauge that.* And until any of this is defined or organized, these matters will persist in the way they are now -- impasses, a standstill, a traffic jam, frustration, ignorance.   
How long can randomness persist? It would be selfish to deny the developing world, for example, what may be there the best ticket yet to financial inclusion. For what? Random, organic change, if any? And this is assuming that good change is predicated necessarily on randomness. It isn't. You see something in the distance, you don't blindfold yourself, spin around on a stick 15 times, and dizzily hope you get there. You walk towards it. Take step towards it.
People are planning and controlling no matter what. If that wasn't the case, we'd still be on the first version post-Satoshi and there would be no core devs. I'm proposing to decentralize this control as much as possible without being subjected to the whims of those who do not have the expertise or exposing the network to shills so that consensus can finally be reached, *which then goes on to the final consensus of the entire network having a say by choosing to update or not*. In effect, a convention with economics experts, the core devs, heads of mining pools, *perhaps* certain CEOs, people that best represent the majority interest of sects of the ecosystem, etc. so we can get things done and finally move on to the next thing.
**tl;dr** Bitcoin ecosystem and development need better organization with changes on the table like these. We need careful deliberation and decision making, with the same breadth of input as the many academic disciplines that converged to form Bitcoin. Extend the discussion a bit further out to experts in key fields to make sure all bases are covered, *in such a way that allows the discussion to all be in one place, all laid out, with the mandate of some sort of consensus reached by the end*.

neither of them accepting bitcoin matters right now. what matters is ameliorating some of the protocol's deficiencies that have become apparent as of late. i think we are well past the stage of which merchant is accepting bitcoin and which isn't. we've learned that that approach of moving bitcoin forward doesn't work. sure, huge hype as overstock, microsoft, etc. accept, they see *some* volume, but then dissipates a month later as the only early adopters who have bitcoin *and* are willing to spend move on. we need to solve the underlying problem of getting consumers to acquire/use bitcoin before merchant adoption becomes a relevant issue again. the reasons why merchants should are undeniable -- 3% increase in bottomline, fast payments, transparency, etc. the same cannot be said for average joe developed-world consumer. before any of that however, we need to solve the technological-economic issues with the protocol.
i think one of the biggest challenges the community and ecosystem faces in order to grow is its organization and political structure. how that is solved while maintaining decentralization and trying to balance the authority of computer scientists versus the opinions of enthusiasts versus the wisdom of economists... i have no clue but we're seeing that unfold as we speak. although, i like to think of the ecosystem as a newborn country trying to find a political scheme that works for it despite originating from lofty ideals. may follow the same road as most human political-economic organizations before it (viz our humanity), but i hope it blazes a new, sustainable trail. might be the beginnings of a global sovereign power, a world state, something never before witnessed in political science. interesting stuff.
i read a comment earlier about gathering up all the devs, ecosystem leaders in economics, etc. at a symposium where they might able to come to a consensus about the issues. shit, even invite the heads of all the major mining pools. this reminds me of the American constitution convention, where the country's leaders -- the forefathers -- came together in an organized way, face-to-face, debated it out and came to an agreement over the country's first principles. suffice to say we're still here and kicking ass 200 years later (even though modern day politicians shit all over the constitution). the ecosystem enthusiasts (us) would be quick to concede to authorities in economics and computer science, so i think this may be a good approach at achieving consensus over the recent technical issues, especially insofar as in this day and age and after the past couple of weeks, we have data to analyze for better informed decisions.
**tl;dr** we need to hold a symposium, a Constitution Convention of a sort, consisting of core devs, experts in economics, the heads of all major mining pools, etc. to achieve some semblance of consensus to move bitcoin forward. obviously, it would need to be livestreamed for transparency's sake. it worked back then when America was young, it may work now (just don't make the same mistake of implementing a representative democracy, electoral college, lifetime terms for justices, etc.) -- bitcoin now is like a young, *global* country trying to figure out its political structure. consensus will never be achieved without organization. this solution may be as good as decentralized organization can get. these guys make an informed, well-thought out decision and i'm sure the majority of us enthusiasts would agree with their collective expertise.

they've made some venture investments, i believe. according to "digital gold", they were integral in the industry's first steps. they are also hodling a decent amount. the ETF could be game changing, but gemini was/will be late to the party.

you increase the number of ventures autoinvest can invest in. for example, my first autoinvest profile had very strict criteria and it wasn't investing in anything. when i included other currencies besides btc and usd, and longer periods than just 1 month and 90 days, autoinvest started investing in a lot more ventures. so, the less strict your criteria is, the more ventures you'll invest in.
beyond that, its all judgement. some currencies are more volatile than others (argentina, russia, etc.). i believe microfinance is better suited for short-term investment (1 month to 3 month time spans) and that the longer they go on, the less inclined the borrower is to pay back (more time that shit can go wrong for whatever reason, they can't stick to their plan and can't pay back). etc.
with the autoinvest criteria, its a balance between available ventures and effects on return.

decentralization affords some of the consumer safety that regs are intended for. by your logic, less costs for digital currency payments.
and i'm not sure the banking process right now is that simple. there's multiple banks involved, multiple fees, with longer waits than digital currency transactions any way you see it.
if remittance firms get that big, there's no need to use banks whatsoever. might be enough adoption at that point such that people are fine holding on to some bitcoin, i.e., remittance firm only uses bitcoin without ever touching USD except to cash out to pay operational costs. realistically though, i expect there will be a minimal reliance on banks at that point.

No, shitcoins can all fuck themselves. There is a huge distinction between the topicality of altcoins vs. the topicality of changes to the Bitcoin protocol.

word on the street is ripple has been bad mouthing bitcoin in meetings with banks
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:20:23
The FT article was suspiciously neutral. It usually and unabashedly spews out hate towards the Bitcoin industry (a la "Bitcoin having "now zero" chance of success").
Also, it seems like they're building a Ripple with/on Bitcoin--which doesn't make sense because not only is there already Ripple, but Ripple sucks AND like the zerohedge article talks about, there are cheaper, more efficient solutions to sprout up that will easily displace them. Isn't one of the premises of Bitcoin that it removes middle-men?
This stinks. Banks and finance players moving in helps legitimize the industry, but keep in mind there are a lot of shady or parasitic bankers and finance players looking to make a quick buck with little care towards the destroyed worlds lying in their wake.

i had a hunch about align commerce, as i believe they were one of the first to move away from mentioning "bitcoin". 
as of today, their homepage has no mention of "bitcoin", "blockchain", "block chain", or "digital currency".
as far as any others, nothing comes to mind but i imagine there are more. it makes the most economic sense. imagine if we beat venmo to the punch by releasing a social p2p payments app built with bitcoin, but mentions bitcoin nowhere. we'd have ourselves a great deal of indirect adoption.
i want to advise caution taking a negative angle a la "but not telling their users". not mentioning blockchain -- which is trustless, peer-reviewed, open source, etc. -- is like not mentioning the use of linux, other trusted protocols and products as part of the product's tech stack. if there is any risk involved in how a company uses bitcoin/blockchain, there would be disclosures if the company is legitimate. a manipulation argument would be hard to make.
a lot of communication is lost on using mere text, so i'm assuming you didn't mean anything by "but not telling their users".

some of the companies you listed have built businesses around bitcoin *in no unclear terms*, while companies that are  simply changing their branding to meet current demand are mainly utilizing the technology that underpins bitcoin (well-aware that blockchain ↔ token). to be frank, it couldv'e been/could be litecoin for all this latter group cares, as long as the benefits of whatever digital currency's technology is square peg-square hole. we can thank bitcoin's success for bearing the blockchain -- these companies wouldn't be around otherwise and it will be the one true blockchain in the future -- but these relatively early days its mostly about traction. 
the smartest companies are blackboxing bitcoin as part of their tech stack -- their branding mentions neither "blockchain" nor "bitcoin". with this approach, you're least likely to alienate mainstream users. slightly less smart companies are using blockchain instead of "bitcoin" -- a little alienation insofar as tech complexity and guilt by bitcoin association. and finally, if you're not giant like coinbase or hyperfocused on bitcoin (e.g., miners), the dumb companies continue to use "bitcoin", needlessly crippling their mainstream user acquisition.
if we're talking about the smartest companies, rebranding isn't about appeasing VCs. basic consumers don't care about tech stack makeup -- most just care the it works and is better than the next best thing -- but they do care deeply if products that are contentious and/or risky. 
rather, any sort of rebranding to appease the money is being done at the VC level. bitcoin venture investment is a "consumer product" of a sort for your average investor, but one that cannot be blackboxed because of diligence research, legal disclosures, etc., so the vehicles have equivocated "blockchain" (e.g., DCG, cryptocurrency partners -&gt; blockchain capital, etc.).
if we're talking about the slightly less smart companies, that's all it is. changing a single word to meet the current, sexy trend. the margin of connotation (and hence behavior based on these words) between "bitcoin" and "blockchain" is sufficient such that companies find it profitable to spend resources on re-branding.
a compelling way it was put to me: google "bitcoin" versus "blockchain". 
* "bitcoin" you get: nothing but controversy angles (nobody wants to use something that's even remotely risky or contentious), SR, Gox, "worst currency investment of 2014", "bubble", as of late "terrorism financing", "banks hate bitcoin but love blockchain xD", shittily run, scam-ad-infested cryptocurrency news publications, etc. etc. etc.
* "blockchain"?: "this revolutionary tech will change the world", "wall streeters abandoning *everything* to work on this one, emergent technology", "bill gates on what blockchain can do for poor african children", etc.
some like coinbase, that are all. about. bitcoin. from top to bottom, don't have as much leeway, if any, to equivocate. also, the propensity to change depends on how successful you are: coinbase can be bold about bitcoin, whereas circle's branding is much more watered down in comparison (a recent update has a message at log-in to try to get bitcoiners to accept a fully USD platform, trying to tie loose branding ends).
most of the companies i know are balls deep in bitcoin but still have no qualms about playing the charade. at face, it seems like they're defying values -- and i know loves it some strongly held values -- but it's just a temporary path of least resistance to get us all where we want to be. very, very few companies have actually pivoted their products from using the bitcoin blockchain to something that is actually "blockchain, not bitcoin". 
tl;dr: if the move away from bitcoin is on the product level, then you can be concerned.

experimentation can be done on a sidechain -- it'd actually be more desirable to do so rather than begin another network
