CoinReport does employ nofollow though for press releases for this very reason.  It is in the meta tags.  This has always been the case.

It definitely is concerning but I don't think that Russia will outright ban bitcoin all together. I think many governments around the world are just being extra cautious when it comes to bitcoin especially knowing fully well that it threatens the very nature of fiat currencies.

This is interesting.  Coin Report is listed yet we have never accepted payment for publishing an article.  The article in question does not show any conversation with Coin Report and simply lists us as the bad guys for using a broker.
The only payment we have accepted was for [hosting press releases]( which are never meant to be taken as articles and is explicitly in their own category to denote this.  Companies like PR Web charge for that sort of service as well yet nobody would say anything is wrong with that.
In fact I specifically told our team that if they replied to that email that the only way we'd publish this article was in accordance with FTC disclosures and if they were OK with us having such a disclosure we could discuss further.  However I do not believe anyone responded to that email.  I told ZeroBlock exactly the same last week when the conversation came up and I'm sure Dan can verify this if he visits this subreddit.
By the way this is also why you don't see Bitcoin tips on the Coin Report.

It's true that banks do play an important role in our lives still but really it is the people who gave them that importance to begin with. Yes they fooled us into thinking our "money" will be safe in their custody... how wrong were we.... I've heard cases where banks are sending notices to their customers who use coinbase to not have any dealings with them...

Yes, always been the case.  If you Google for them our site will show up.  That is the "index" part.  So I'll admit you have a point that their existence would be known but this is no different than if we'd gone the other route we considered and simply allowed anyone to submit their own press releases for free like some sites allow.  If we could find a wordpress plugin that was secure that allowed for this we'd have likely gone that route instead.
But by having "nofollow" anything they link to in the release fails to receive any "link juice".

I have an editor to pay who has to ready everything, upload images, review, and publish.  As I stated in the other thread if we had found a plugin for Wordpress that allowed people to upload their own press releases we would have probably done it for free since only the review and clicking "publish" steps would be have been necessary.  But on the otherhand if we allowed free publishing of press releases we'd probably be overrun with them at significant cost.

Press releases, not stories.  Press releases are different as they are clearly written by the company that is being promoted.  This is what press releases have always been everywhere.  I also told Dan when we recently joined Zero Block that he should exclude that category since it contains user generated content.

Disclosure:  Obviously I run another cryptocurrency news site.  I personally own less than 20 Bitcoins and no altcoins however I also don't exercise editorial control.  My main role is to make sure everyone gets paid and hire talent as deemed necessary.
I hate to do this to someone in our field but your statements on Reddit actually contradict what you've just said.
[Contradiction 1]
On September 8th you specifically stated that you pay for CoinFire from money you make from crypto.




[Contradiction 2]
On October 11 you posted that your mom is now a believer due to The Rise And Rise of Bitcoin.  This means your family benefits from from cryptocurrency's success and possibly your reporting.
Can you explain these contradictions?  You have a very high reputation around here but what you have just stated is clearly false by your own words.

For someone like CoinReport we don't want to buy coins, track them for capital gains purposes, and then pay them out to our writers.  Having a payroll system that allows fiat to go in and Bitcoin to come out on the employee side provides a lot of value.
Doing Bitwage allow that or is it just keeping track of records?

Yet we vet all advertisers on our site and maintain an active blacklist via Adsense.  It doesn't really take that long.  Usually it is just a matter of asking whether the company has ties to cloud mining.  If they do they don't get a response.
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:03:40
Thanks for this post.  While we haven't experimented going the donation route ourselves ads are what keeps sites like ours alive.  Running a business easily costs several thousand dollars per month to pay proper writers and editors who spend hours per day in their profession.
The other thing to consider is that by tipping news sites you are essentially leaving it up to readers to say what is news and what isn't with their money.  What is to prevent large organisations such as the government, Koch brothers, or whatever else is out there from anonymously tipping such sites on certain stories and not others as a means of skewing what news is published?
@_date: 2014-02-01 17:04:30
Interesting Indeed
@_date: 2015-01-19 01:30:48
Actually CoinReport also did not advertise GAW or Paycoin.  We don't advertise any company that is involved in Cloud Mining which disqualified GAW.  We also did not sell our entire advertising capacity to CoinTelegraph when offered several months ago since we'd lose control of that aspect.  As you might have noticed CoinTelegraph turned around and sold that ad space to Paycoin recently which is why so many news sites were advertising them.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:02:39


That makes sense.  Back in August we were approached by them asking us how much it would cost to buy all our advertising space.  We declined to respond because we suspected they'd just resell our ads at a markup or advertise themselves (a competitor).
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:08:52


News sites aren't obligated to advertise everyone that comes to them giving them the benefit of the doubt.
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:09:06
For contractors we use Bitwage.  For someone that regularly works for you that may make more sense.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:10:27
That looks too suspicious
@_date: 2015-01-03 08:50:11
At CoinReport we have a strict policy of not running ads from any company that participates in cloud mining.  We end up turning down almost every advertiser that comes to us anyway since the vast majority of them are suspect at best.
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:23:28


Their advertisers are extremely questionable (we'd never advertise most of them ourselves) but charging $3k per month is not at all unreasonable given the traffic.  Through adsense we scrape by at just under $2 per thousand impressions.  Given our traffic this means we lose thousands per month just trying to report the news.  But when you consider that CCN claims to have 1M impressions per month that is only $3 per thousand impressions.  That is fairly cheap.
