it seems to be. I just dont get why! I activated tier 2 and then deposited a small sum of money. That never made it into my account because they wanted me to verify tier 3 before giving it to me! After I did that and after about 4 days of wait they finaly gave me the money but added:
" Please understand that for any further deposits you will need to also provide us with an "ID selfie" - this is a picture of you holding the ID you used for tier 3 verification. We're very sorry to have this further requirement, but it's necessary to help prevent fraud. It's something we just started requiring, so that's why we didn't tell you about it earlier. If you want to submit the ID selfie, just reply to this email and let us know. If you don't wish to provide the ID selfie, then please do not make any further deposits. Again, I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.
Kraken Support"
so maybe its just me but I rly dont like this requirement and think that it is going a bit far. As said in this thread, with all the info they have on me by now they rly need to keep it safe and I dont know if I trust them that much. would love to hear why I get this treatment...

I have had the same Answer from 2 different support tickets now. All are legit Mails from Kraken.com
maybe can confirm?
heres a quote: "[...] because of new fraud protection measures, you will need to upload an ID selfie if you choose to deposit again."
maybe its just me and the just hate me or smth but thats what I got from 2 Support Members.

people buy bitcoin from other people because they speculate that in the future, t the price will rise and they will be able to sell the bitcoin for more than they bought it for. 
In addition to that Bitcoin is heading into another fork meaning everyone that owns bitcoin at one point in the near future will get some bitcoin gold for free. Thats why people want to own bitcoin mostly
