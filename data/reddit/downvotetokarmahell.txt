You would think they would? Facebook feels like they are trying to abide by what regulators want with this, and unless it’s a marketing move, waiting until Maxine issues a subpoena (unfortunately I think because she is chair of the financial services committee she can act alone and do that) is probably not a good look for Facebook.
Being seen as defiant of congress might result in a harsh crackdown by more congresspeople that may have originally been sympathetic to Libra.

How many social media sites are technically superior to Facebook? I’d argue several, but Facebook still holds the crown, there’s a cost of switching to a new platform that others aren’t on, and the quality improvements don’t outweigh the cost of being on a network no one else uses. Same is true with money, if the majority are on bitcoin, and developing on bitcoin, unless there is a feature you specifically need that bitcoin doesn’t offer, it doesn’t make sense to leave bitcoin, and even if that feature is something bitcoin can’t do, it doesn’t make sense to abandon bitcoin altogether. The majority of these other projects have zero value, and the only users are the scammed, the scammers, and the speculators.

A lot of people fail to set growth/Price targets for the positions they take. Because of this basic investment/trading failure, that simple rule applies: when uncertain, sell, because no one ever went broke taking profit. It’s hardly quaint for a person holding Bitcoin from sub $1,000 to more than $10,000 to say they are satisfied with their gains, and to realize the on paper value of their investment. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.

Not to “well actually” you, but:
Well actually, I ran the same bitcoin vs stocks google trends report; the highest point of that report for stocks was Feb, if you look at a chart of the S &amp; P 500, you can actually see that late Jan/early feb of 2018 was the first real issue the stock market had since the trump election (S&amp; P had gained more than 30% in that timeframe before this dip of about 10% which began after than Jan top)
Edit: not saying your theory about money moving into stocks is wrong, but I think your theory explaining the google trend is
Edit 2, actually, yeah, your whole theory is wrong, since after that January too in the S &amp; P 500, a new high wasn’t realized until August of 18.

The problem is it’s a regressive tax, taxing the young to pay the old who had their entire lives to accumulate wealth. Why should the kid just out of high school be forced to finance the bad decisions of old people. Why should the new couple raising a family have to give up money that could be used for better child care have to pay for someone who just pissed away their money because they knew the gov would be there to hand them a check. Social security has perverted incentive structures so much that people plan for retirement under the assumption that they will get social security, and therefore are not making as prudent financial decisions.

No, it’s a bad decision.
If you exist in this world, you know the longer you go on, the more likely you are to get old/sick, and eventually you will not be able to work. This is a fact. So who’s responsibility is it to make the hedge against an individual having that bad luck? That individual. The fact that bad luck can wipe a person out eventually becomes the result of bad decision making.
Is it really just bad luck if a 30 year old can only make a living at McDonald’s, of course not, even if a person started with a horrible hand, eventually bad decisions were made on their path, to suggest that bad luck alone should be blamed for people’s unfortunate financial situations is to deprive them of agency and humanity.
I’m not condemning those that are financially struggling in their old age, I’m just saying it’s immoral to forcibly take money from someone that’s been on the planet for a third as long and reallocate their funds to the old.

If it isn’t a public ledger, and is permissioned anyway, I don’t see why it wouldn’t be more prudent to have a distributed database which stores logs. I suspect this could be much more easily done than creating a blockchain, since blockchains by nature are intentionally bulky and slow.

The concerning thing about this to me is the number of people that make Bitcoin’s entire value proposition based on the fixed supply claim. But it seems like there’s a number of people in the community that are willing to consider a deviation from the originally stated 21 million supply.
This leads to what I would consider to be the biggest threat to bitcoin, a failure of the ideals of the community, and the continued politicizing of the community. It isn’t unlikely to imagine a scenario where a large group of new bitcoin users come into the space, but decide in time to make a change or fork.

If your security as an exchange is so poor that you can’t protect your assets, you deserve to get rekt because you didn’t cherish the coins.

Counterparty risk.
The point of bitcoin is you can verify for yourself that you have the bitcoin. You can’t do that with a gold based crypto. If someone steals the gold, the blockchain won’t save you (OR EVEN TELL YOU) Garbage data in, garbage out. This is the same reason that supply chain blockchains are idiotic as well. Very susceptible to attack simply from putting bad data in.

If you’re interested in alternative forms of distribution, both GRIN and Monero offer unique distribution forms with a capless but controlled supply. Monero with a tail emissions and grin with a constant emission rate. But I’m not here to shill altcoins. 
Since a single individual can make near infinite addresses, there is no way to programmatically set a cap on how much an individual can mine, nor would you want to. Unless miners somehow have free electricity, and most do not, they need to cover their costs and sell. It is the nature of money that it will be unevenly distributed, if you did a great reset and gave everyone on earth an equal amount of money, and resources and then waited a year, we would see a select group at the top will have accumulated the most. These people will also likely be best equipped to use those resources to the betterment of everyone through best applications of capital resources. Suffice to say, inequality is natural and unavoidable. The risk of inequality brought about by meddling in markets (see Federal Reserve and the US banking cabal) is much greater inequality going to those that do not allocate resources in a way that benefits others by growing their own wealth and others. Market meddlers achieve their gross inequality by abusing their monopolistic powers.
Since inequality is unavoidable in any system, it is best to distribute the coins to those that are actively helping to secure the network (the miners). If you don’t like this, you are welcome to be left behind.

As someone already mentioned, the supply is extremely divisible. The smallest unit on chain (a sat, or a satoshi) is worth less than a hundredth of a penny right now. But if the price of a sat ever appreciates “too much” (wouldn’t that be a dream) second or third layer solutions could provide additional divisibility of sats off chain to allow for transmissions of smaller values.

If it is happening they won’t tell us.
There has been anecdotal evidence supplied from people in Venezuela and I think Iran having their mining hardware confiscated by gov officials. Probs not a stretch to assume these countries are both acquiring some crypto.
If you trust US gov and muller, he suggests that Russian operatives used crypto As a part of their election interference operations. So it isn’t a stretch to think that Russia has some crypto operations.
There have been articles on North Korea using crypto to skirt sanctions as well.
Basically, if you’re a government who the US has sanctions on, crypto looks like an attractive way to do business. But even if a country decides to start shifting their monetary policy to start increasing their bitcoin stores, they sure as hell ain’t going to make it public.
Why wouldn’t they make it public? Well the game theory doesn’t support it. It’s a limited asset, and it is undeniable that govs have already seen advantages of using bitcoin, so if it’s a limited and valuable asset, the rational thing to do would be to acquire large amounts of bitcoin, but without letting anyone else know, because once the cat is out of the bag, there’s going to be a massive “arms race” to scoop up the remaining liquid bitcoin by countries that are wise to the advantages. Even countries that might not “believe” might be given incentive to jump in so they don’t risk being left behind.

Ownership of 1 entire bitcoin puts you in the global top 1% of all possible bitcoin owners ever. An even distribution of bitcoin assuming none of the initial 21 mil are lost (obviously a foolish assumption) and assuming a pop of 7.5 billion means that everyone would only get 0.0028 bitcoin. Bitcoin is scarce. In fact, it would put you in the upper echelon of the top 1% to just own a single bitcoin. All of this is to say that having an entire bitcoin is absolutely a huge deal and would fall under the category of “especially if you have more than most others”
If I am jealous and desperate, a large amount of wealth stored in a bearer asset like bitcoin is much much easier to confiscate from you than other large potential stores of wealth. There’s a reason [this XKCD]( is so often cited when discussing security, unless you are being extremely diligent in utilizing a well reasoned multisig setup, it wouldn’t be hard to separate you from your coins, because most of the methods people use to store their keys are the equivalent of hiding those keys in their sock drawer.

Ask yourself why you’re getting in, do you just want to get fiat rich? Fine, but follow basics of trading rules. Assess your risk reward scheme, and make your decision based on the amount of risk you’re willing to stomach and what percentage gain would be enough to make you cash out.

Whatever bitcoin was “meant to be” is irrelevant, what is bitcoin now, and what might it be in the future? Clearly bitcoin has accomplished the objective of being a cash, but to refute your point, Cash needs to store value to be useful. Even if not for very long. But A borderless permission-less and censorship resistant way to send my peer $3 isn’t that interesting, a way to send my peer $3,000 or $10,000 or even more without permission and with censorship resistance is extremely powerful and interesting. The properties of censorship resistance and permission-less transactions coupled with a limited supply lend itself to becoming a store of value.
If you look at the global financial situation there are clearly weaknesses that can make  case for a crypto to become the world reserve currency, it’s not a certainty, but it is a possibility.

Assuming that 3 million bitcoin are lost forever, to be ultra wealthy (higher than 1% of world’s wealth) in a hyper bitcoin world, you need only own more than 0.1344 bitcoin.
This is based on looking at the way current wealth is distributed in the world. The top 1% control about 45% of all wealth today, it’s relatively safe to assume that wealth distribution will be comparable in a new economy, so you can apply the available bitcoin supply and apply it to a given population and make assumptions about how much bitcoin one would need to own to be ultra wealthy.
To be in the top 10%, you only need to own about 0.01084 bitcoin.
Obviously (and here’s hoping y’all down downvote me to hell for this), bitcoin becoming the primary store of value in the world and usurping the rest of the currencies is not guaranteed, but it is possible. If you think it is possible enough that you want to be prepared, you owe it to yourself to make a relatively safe bet, just $100 put in bitcoin today ensures you a rich future in a new bitcoin economy. $1000 means you’ll be the equivalent of a millionaire. $10,000 or a full bitcoin basically means you’d be full billionaire mode. If you can’t afford $100 in bitcoin and you’re lurking Reddit thinking about bitcoin, you owe it to yourself to log off and earn some extra money to buy some coins.
