I would really appreciate comments that have information as to what to do in the event that one falls into this category, instead of attacks or personal theories on tax.  Lets start now.

Whenever I see a post by darkwing, all I think of is that this is some pathetic loser who dedicates his life to spreading negative BS.
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:54:16
You're spot on.  I'm just bitter because I'm thinking about the money I could've made while sleeping.  The coffee just kicked in and its all coming together for me.  Ah well.
@_date: 2014-01-03 18:01:43
Very, VERY important post.  There are many of us already familiar with these concepts, but far too many who've blindly jumped in.  Hopefully some will be fortunate enough to read this and ultimately apply it.  
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:40:19
Thanks fellas.

$10k in bitcoin; $15k in S&amp;P 500 index fund with low expense ratio and decent dividend (like IVV or VOO).  PS... no one knows the right answer, if they did they wouldn't need to go to work, they'd use their "crystal ball" and play with the market all day.  
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:46:32
I've been in Bitcoin before any major business even spoke about it and all I can say is... It's finally happening
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:55:00
It's due to the retardedly slow realization that the death of Mt. Gox was the BEST, not worst, thing for bitcoin at this time.  We removed a huge chunk of fuckery from the world of Bitcoin, now competence should prevail.  
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:22:17
Exactly!  Just explained this to my gf.  I'll be excited regardless, "no" means buy the dip, "yes" means ride the rip (and maybe buy more in a state of excited mania.  I remember the days of sub $100... these are some amazing times!
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:32:48
100% possibly yes but maybe no?
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:58:39
Lol what a dangerous post.  What if you're friends and family read this, they buy because you planted the idea of bitcoin in their minds... and it tanks to $600?  NEVER tell someone to buy at the highs because your "crystal ball" gave insight into the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:59:34
I remember he once tweeted, "lets give bitcoin a boost."  10 mins later bitcoin surged pretty significantly.  Anyone else remember that?  Kim don't play. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:41:11
Oh boy.  Bangsters are gonna be pisssssed
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:44:13
There is no telling where the price of bitcoin will be in the very short term.  Do not believe anyone who "knows" where the price will be short term.  However if you look at the bigger picture, it is hard to imagine that we won't have more buyers than sellers soon.  I believe selling out of fear was a large contributor to this price drop.  Try to focus on the innovated genius behind bitcoin, see it's real value, that there is only a finite amount of bitcoin that will ever exist.  It truly is a beautiful and groundbreaking technology/currency/commodity... whatever you want to call it.  
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:34:35
wake me up at $10,000
@_date: 2016-11-03 04:07:22
Woah wierd... I too am just a normal 31 year old guy who started buying on coinbase back in Oct of 2013 when bitcoin was at a high of $120... Gains galore.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:34:19
My crystal ball is currently charging.  Once I shake it and get the answer I will post.  Until then it will either tank, do nothing, or lunar launch.
@_date: 2018-06-21 11:39:24
Most don't know how their credit card works, how their google search engine works... They still use them nearly every day.  If you are passionate about the technicality, go down that internet wormhole :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:16:47
What are you going to do when it plunges to $4,000?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:43
Fear selling will ultimately be a painful learning experience for many, I've done it sub $1,000 on a few occasions and always had regrets.  This IS healthy and this WILL rebound.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:14
While others were squeezing out a (fear) terd.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:16:58
Honest question:  How are you handling taxes?  I'm about to reach my selling point.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:06:58
Yes, might seem weird from someone in here since 2013... but we're up over 75% this month.  I love it, and have shot down every bitcoin hater that comes my way, but it just seems a little more manic than anything else which can lead to trouble.  Anyway, yes I'm still holding, really I'm not here to talk shit or spread fear.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:02:27
This is great, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:25:24
Very logical statement.  I agree.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:18:30
On my phone running errands with gf, numbers are approximations, but close enough.  Peace be with you. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:47:25
No I haven't unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:35:26
The easiest thing to do is call bitcoin a bubble.  Scroll down and look at authors photo he's like 16. "At his high school in Dripping Springs, Max is also the captain of the congressional debate team."  Not joking lol
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:54:55
By the time there is an ETF, bitcoin will likely be over $10,000 anyway...
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:38:10
Author is in high school lol.  "At his high school in Dripping Springs, Max is also the captain of the congressional debate team"
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:49:16
Actually what we don't need is your obnoxious response Bitcoin-Yoda.    I hate people like you on here.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:01:14
If you try to time the dips and the rips... statistically speaking you will lose.  Keep invested what your willing to lose, just hold.
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:58:22
I've watched people ask this question in increments from $100 to todays price.  Invest what you're capable of losing and give it time.  Bitcoin likely will go way higher on a long enough timeline.
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:53:45
I remember my first transaction.  Simply losing a silly sports bet and sending him some BTC.  It was then that I was hooked on the tech, the obsession became permanent.
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:15:05
lol def Roger!
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:04:43
Or... Maybe the fact that it went parabolic on PCP and steroids due to fomo had something to do with it.  Textbook bubble pop.
@_date: 2013-12-31 03:08:08
Great ideas indeed.  Based on that response and your site alone, it seems as though you have a lot to contribute to coinbase.  Good luck.  
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:07:53
I've been following for months, I've also seen your posts multiple times and know how you work.  With that being said, I will not comment on behalf of anything else you write.  However, I would be genuinely interested in any objective comments about the pros/cons of this news from anyone with a sound mind.  Please no one respond to Darkwing, I want this to be strictly for information exchange, I have a life to live.  Cheers.
@_date: 2013-12-27 14:43:35
Go to bitcoinwisdom.com, click bitstamp. Then try not to stare at it all day :)
@_date: 2013-12-31 04:31:21
This guy is hilarious.  Spends his whole life dedicated to talking shit on the internet.  I always look when darkwing posts something because its gauranteed shit talking
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:42:53
His previous 'predictions,' that apparently add to his competency, could've been made by a high schooler who paid attention in finance class. However, read his predictions about the future of the Internet, his praise of Enron, and you will see why his 'prediction' doesn't matter.
