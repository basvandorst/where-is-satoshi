IMO it's a bit early to debate the pros &amp; cons of a system that hasn't been deployed yet. LN can evolve, nothing is set in stones.
I get the sense that you are assuming that there will be a handful of large LN "hubs" and each LN transaction between A &amp; B will consist of one single "hop" through one of these large hubs?
The way I imagine it is that LN nodes will be very similar to packet-switching nodes in the TCP/IP stack. When you hit  the path you get there is not deterministic. It depends on where you are / which nodes you currently connect with / current network conditions etc. Similarly, when you transact in a LN network, you don't have to trust any particular node, rather it will take the path of least resistance (lowest number of hops / lowest cumulative fees / etc.). In that sense, there is no "trusted" third party. 
Again, all this remains to be seen as we are very early in the development of LN / Layer 2 protocols.

Interesting... I agree with your analysis that the vulnerability sets up a messed up incentive structure.
However, I'm going to play the devil's advocate here... Few questions: 
1) Do you think it's the miners' responsibility to not exploit a loop hole in the system, if they manage to find one? It's not their fault the protocol wasn't perfect. Their job is to compete and survive in the marketplace. 
2) Do you think the protocol can ever be "perfect", free of loop holes such as the one we found? What if it's not the only one?
Being an engineer myself, the notion of "perfect" software sounds like pipe dream to me. We can't make the assumption that the law/protocol/consensus rules are perfect. We have to assume otherwise. That means there will always be exploits available. So IMO it's better to put the issue in this context, and not condemn someone for exploiting. Just like in laws, there is a distinction between what's right and what's legal. (We should condemn them for other kinds of misbehavior like lying, though).

I agree with your overall sentiment that free market doesn't work well if left to its own devices. I also agree that there is a reason governments exist, despite the fact that most people when asked, would say they absolutely hate them. And yes governments can absolutely corrupt and have a strong tendency to do so. (FWIW, I grew up in a communist country and now reside in the US, so I've seen both sides of the same coin).
Coming back to Bitcoin... with the acknowledgement that the free market cannot be completely unregulated, who/what would be providing the necessary regulatory function in Bitcoin? Who/what would be able to stop power from being consolidated into the hands of a few people like Jihan Wu or Roger Ver?
Satoshi's original answer was decentralization. But a system isn't a static thing, it's a constantly moving beast. What's decentralized today might be centralized tomorrow, due to some random events or staged actions of a few (e.g.: fear mongering campaign, people acting irrational in crisis situations). The system is always vulnerable to this risk of being centralized. What's worth noting, is that once pockets of power form, it is hard to reverse the effects, because the strong would grow stronger and the weak weaker. One does not have to go very far to see a recent example of this: The Internet and the fight for net neutrality. For decades people have taken the decentralized nature of Internet for granted. And now we gradually gravitate to more and more walled gardens. Facebook, Google, ISPs, etc. Will it play out the same way for Bitcoin once it becomes big enough? We will see. I have no answer for this either. Maybe humans are doomed for this kind of fate, due to our inherently flawed, corruptible nature. Maybe like you said, every system will eventually corrupt, and when it reaches a tipping point people will revolve, and then repeat the same fate, over and over again.

thoughts: has anyone seriously ever tried deploying this BIP (or any other BIPs) in a contentious network situation? Various scenarios: 10% for / 90% against; 50% for / 50% against; 90% for / 10% against.
Is it possible to simulate these scenarios on a testnet (possibly with the option of accelerated timeline), or is it possible to set one up if there is nothing like that already? 
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:26:45


Not true. There will be 2 chains. Users (some will not even be aware a split has occurred) who get paid with coins mined on non-BIP148 chain, will lose all their money if that chain gets reorg-ed. That's just one example.
@_date: 2017-05-21 07:32:09
it pains me too :-/ I hope this doesn't go terribly wrong, or it will be much harder to pull off UASF the next time around.
@_date: 2017-05-22 22:03:48
+1000. Thank you Greg for always being a calm presence, especially in this difficult time.
UASF is a valid approach to deployment but *it has to be done safely and responsibly*. Everyone is free to run their own software but Core must keep maintaining a high standard, because lowering the standard won't bode well for Bitcoin in the long run. I'm for BIP149 (or any safer alternative).
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:34:04


Also, *their impression of how successful it will be* doesn't sound like a terribly good heuristic to making decisions on a network as large as Bitcoin. I like the fact that you tend to lean towards the more conservative side of things and keep it level-headed.
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:14:10


I didn't see any mention of unaware users getting caught in this fight and lose money. That is a valid scenario.


I don't agree with your definition of "malicious". Some have ulterior motive (ie: ASICBOOST) in blocking it, but doing nothing and not signaling BIP148 support doesn't necessarily mean they are being malicious. Some might support SegWit but not BIP148. You can't lump all people who disagree with your way of doing thing as "malicious". 


How so? Why is BIP149, which is a lot safer, *worse*? Why can't we deploy this the right way- what's the rush?
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:19:20
exactly, if BIP148 doesn't get 51% hash rate, it will create a huge disruption and potentially cause millions of dollars of loss. The illusion that a BIP148 SF is "safe" is so wrong.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:27:34
so you push for a reckless solution, then blame anyone who doesn't follow along with your plan as equally "reckless"? can you see the bias in your own thinking here?
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:46:47
finally someone with some sense! Thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:39:08
I have no problem with UASF, but I think BIP149 is a safer way to do it. BIP148 is much more disruptive and IMO, reckless.
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:20:47
Thanks for the reply Greg.


So two otherwise equally well informed people can have radically different views on its safety just based on their impression of how successful it will be.
Fair enough, but you do agree that we should make sure everyone involved is at least aware of all the risks entailed with BIP148, including risks for the end users? I got the impression that there is this misconception going around that "hey, BIP148 has absolutely no risk at all ! let's just do it!".


Ok, that does reduce the risk somewhat. Thanks.

UASF != BIP148. I don't understand why people keep conflating the two.
BIP149 is a safer approach to UASF, something that multiple core devs have agreed on (besides nullc, the other ones don't hang out on Reddit). 
1) It doesn't have the same chain split risks as BIP148. 
2) It leaves ample amount of time for nodes to upgrade, for the economic participants to get onboard, vs. the rushed BIP148 2-month timeline. It's ironic that many are laughing at the Barry Silbert agreement because of its *unrealistic timeline*, but fail to see the same logic for BIP148. The cognitive dissonance is incredible.
BIP149 would have a better chance of showcasing what a well thought out &amp; carefully planned UASF looks like and set a good precedent for the future. 
So UASF, yes, but BIP149.
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:26:41
can't agree with this enough.
make no mistake, BIP148 *will* cause a huge disruption, especially in the event that it doesn't get 51% hash rate, which is likely. Businesses and millions of neutral users (many of whom might not give a rat ass about the scaling debate) will be affected for many days. Like you said, it's a declaration of war, threatening to disrupt the status quo if things don't go our way, which is the opposite goal of a soft fork: *Soft fork is about ensuring minimal disruption, not to guarantee it*. This is a reckless way to deploy changes to a 30-billion-dollar network.
I want segwit to activate too, but BIP148 is way too aggressive / disruptive IMHO.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:31:37
just because you believe in something, doesn't make it "fact". BIP148 is far from getting the &gt;50% hash rate it requires to minimize disruption.
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:30:34
If that outcome is inevitable then I'd rather we do it in a safe way. BIP148 is reckless.

*Kinda*, you did mention this:


But I can't help but feel like this is downplaying it, sweeping it under the rug if you will. Someone reading that might only take away that there will be "two bitcoins", but the implications of how serious that is isn't clear until much further down when you say the non-BIP148 chain can get wiped out. The warning signal is weak relative to the amount of true risk, is what I'm trying to say. It's kinda like missing the fine-prints of Amazon Echo's Terms of Services agreement that says they can collect your voice data against your will. It's there, but you have to really squint your eyes to see it.


Agree to disagree. Non-action != malicious.


OK, now this makes a bit more sense. So the main reason you're pushing this is that Litecoin might replace Bitcoin?
