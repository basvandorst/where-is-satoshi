Shouldnt we fight against this? Isn't crypto currency about keeping out wall Street?

I logged in to find 45 million dollars worth of Doge in my account..... Yes it was a bug... Yes I attempted to withdraw it all lol. No it wouldn't let me

I get what you're saying but one dude even goes on how they company wouldn't give him even pictures of the devices. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:09:52
This one?  That everyone is calling a scam? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:10:21
Then what would you recommend?

Yea..after a single attempt to upload my ID it says ive tried to many times today. Why dont they just disable it until they fix it.

What i found though was with shipping....its about the same cost as buying from Amazon. Unless something has changed
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:19:00
Well that escalated quickly

tell him that isnt how to get into a nice nursing home when your rich and he is old AF

Ive asked an electrician buddy if he can hook me up. After getting zapped many years ago i just stay far far away

So can you run 3 PSU's on a 220 circuit?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:41:53
I just found this, it says 3 PSU's. Does that mean for a house youd need 3 circuits for 1 rig? ugh lol

If you watch BTC bch LTC and Eth.... They all follow the same peaks and valleys.... So take this dumb crap to where the morons belong

Any idea why this sudden downturn is happening? Any idea what’s causing it?
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:03:08
I might be thinking of the S5? There was one that basically looked like 3 S9 size units controled by a single controller (pi) and took three PSU's
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:09:34
I ordered as well. And figures.... Hours later s9 went on sale. Ugh. I have an s3 but it's only 2th/s and takes so much damn power.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:10:21
Because all they accept is Bch. But it's better than paying 4x more on eBay
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:13:18
I looked at the specs, t9+ has more chips. 
S9 has 189 chips
T9+ has 162 chips
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:08:00
Doesn't the S7 take like 3 power supplies?
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:26:26
Im not sure if i read it wrong or what....but the way i read it was they take a 0.1 BTC fee if you withdraw less than a whole BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:31:45
I Get that, but i almost bought one but researched it and it looked like it was 3 boxes needing 9 PCIx cables each unit. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:15:52
Because FUCK the IRS
