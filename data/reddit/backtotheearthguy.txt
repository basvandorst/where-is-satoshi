one million Satoshi = 8 bucks
Ten million Satoshi's = 80 bucks.
one billion Satoshi = 8grand
one trillion Satoshi = 8 mill
1 000 000 000 000
totally reasonable. people handle millions billions trillions much better then decimal places. heck Americans are so fucked when it comes to metric system anyway.
Satoshi could be the formal, but i say we just go with coins. how much is that beer? thats a mill, or that a million in coins
Can hear the headlines now, bitcoiners change protocal to make themselves all millionaires!
