Also why would you want to ruin the banks?
The ultimate goal of bitcoin is to replace the current currency system. Because this is a transition period between the use of our current federal currencies, and bitcoin we have exchanges that are based on the price of BTC to USD/CAD or whatever, but this is not the *value* of bitcoin. If the USD crashed, which is not at all unlikely in the not-to distant future, then the value of bitcoin would not go down just because you couldn't purchase USD anymore. Many bitcoin holders are not interested in making fiat currency off of their bitcoin. They are interested in replacing their fiat currency with bitcoin. If the banking system, crashed the value of bitcoin would likely increase, because it is an *alternative* mode of currency. One that is more valuable than our dollars because it has scarcity, and will hopefully remain stable in the long term, where our legal tender will not. Its deflationary currency, as opposed to inflationary currency. Also the banks are at the centre of our current global financial crisis... bitcoin responds to that. We don't want to ruin the banks, they are trying to ruin us!

The DDP has been representing decentralization, and spreading its message far and wide. This is a true open source movement, that wants to do what ever it can to forward the bitcoin/freedom movement.
