Ahhhh ok.  So is there any chance of all being sold one day?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:36:28
OK thanks Randy!  Is a desktop wallet OK?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:12:13
Reer!  Cat fight!
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:06:11
Ok cool so a mobile wallet isn’t the worst. Obviously hardware is the best?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:43:18
OK but a desktop wallet is safer correct?  But if that computer gets stolen I'm screwed right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:28:53
Oh ok I got it.  Sorry to seem dumb, but I was always curious about the "set number" of how many there were.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:26:36
There are only a set number of BTC's out there ya know?  Was just wondering..
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:03:29
What if your phone gets stolen or you lose it?  Are you screwed?  lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:35:06
Yea that's very true!  Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:58:49
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:02:25
OK good to know. Desktop you can use any desktop right?  As long as you know your phrases?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:46:16
I think Y is pissed..
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:36:50
Do you think that would have a serious impact on it's value?  (like make it crash or send it skyrocketing?  Or none at all?
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:20:56
OK cool thanks Modern!
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:26:07
Well the fact that there are only a set number out there to be bought.  So once all those are sold to buyers..
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:30:34
Yea what does that mean exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:43:44
This is great.  
All the decline happening right now is because of the BCH situation on Coinbase.  Mid January is going to see HUGE changes (for the better).
Coinbase fucked up.  PLain and simple, but they are straightenig it out.
Imagine opening a pizza place by yourself and then all of a sudden a flood of people come in wanting pies.  You're gonna mess up some of those pies.
They just need some time to fix their infrastructure, which they are doing. 
I feel great about crypto for 2018.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:52:32
Legit as in safe.  Secure.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:54:05
What do you use?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:21:29
Also sign up for coinbase first right?  Then send to Bread (or whatever one you signed up for?)
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:09:46
OK cool!
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:18:55
Do you have a recc. that isn't hardware?  Something mobile?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:15:46
How about ripple?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:51:49
Thoughts on buying 1 Bitcoin and forgetting about it for 5 years..
Thoughts on what you think it could be at the end of those 5 years?
Could there be a price in the future that it gets corrected on? Could it ever split?
I.E. It hits 50K - and they correct it. Or does that not happen with crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:06:22
Can't you just use Coinbase to hold it securely?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:37:15
OK thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:45:23
So what are you saying?  Coinbase is no good?  I figured they were legit?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:32:39
It's VERY interesting, but I think I may have missed the boat.  If you were me starting now, would you still give it a shot?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:34:16
So even if an exhange like coinbase disappears, you will still be OK with your coins in JAXX?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:28:13
Yep!  Prob a better option for someone in my position?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:57:22
OK thanks
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:27:14
could it get to 100K??
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:43:44
OK thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:28:39
I can only hope!  Haha you're a good investor and got in early!
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:51:42
OK solid advice.  Also one more q.  If I have coinbase on my current phone, and I switch phones, my bitcoin is still in my coinbase account correct?  It wouldn't "disappear" right?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:31:10
Ya think that long?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:08:21
God you're annoying..hope they kick you out.  I'm sure you can pay for your own college and apartment now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:30:55
So which one is best for someone that wants to buy that amount?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:42:05
OK thanks BN!
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:32:38
HAHAHA!!!!  100K would be insane!  What are your thoughts on BTX?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:13:01
Not a bad $800 investment..
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:20:41
Bread is good for someone buying around 10K?  (1 bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:41:39
Which one would you choose?  And also I just sign up for the wallet on the wallet's site, and I can then link it up to coinbase correct?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:34:34
Is JAXX solid?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:53:28
great reply.  Thanks so much for the insight Powder!  I agree with you.  I've def. been checking into ripple.  Seems like a solid play!
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:17:05
Also what is the direction for a beginner?  Does it go..
Deposit into coinbase ---&gt; sign up for a wallet ---&gt; put funds into wallet ---&gt; HODL forever ----&gt; use coinbase to sell?
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:30:44
That's very bullish!  Haha really though?  I am fully IN as far as believing in Bitcoin, but maybe I missed the boat..
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:30:55
Ya think that long?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:31:40
So use Gdax?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:52:58
OK thanks Lenlo!
