Ironic that this news will get burried with mass hysteria of the crashing global economy through failed monetary policy
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:21:23
There arent any alternative crypto currencies that are anywhere near bitcoin. Eth end ripple arent competitors as far as currency

DDOS, happens all the time

Segwit by april, effectively increasing transactions 2x (todays numbers) with a 1.6mb theoretical minimum block size. How is that serious trouble within months when the trajectory of daily transactions dont signal that figure being exceeded? 
@_date: 2016-01-21 15:36:54
that said, making the blockchain smaller on disk isnt the biggest concern. The issue is propagation time for blocks

Wences Casares joins the board of paypal
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:15:33
agreed. The smaller the block footprint, the smaller the disk footprint

I love ether but its highly inflationary, I could see it go to $10, maybe $20 eventually but I cant see much higher

ermergurd! my bitcoins gone!
Wait an see if a fork is going to even happen, and if so is classic going to gain any ground.. then before the fork happens, keep you bitcoin in your wallet and dont move it for a few days. 
then just keep using bitcoin core because as metallica once said. Nothing else matters
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:02:59
How did this amazing post get buried! haha

The entire market cap of Ethereum is equal to bitcoin moving $12. it doesnt even make a dent
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:25:32

@_date: 2016-01-15 09:06:42
Exactly my incentive, its very strange at best.
@_date: 2016-01-27 19:30:21
good luck with your maxiumum 2x-3x returns
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:55:24
Your gleeful attitude at being out of such a potentially huge game leads me to think you are a lying troll
@_date: 2016-01-23 12:14:52
I agree, Its great to see altcoins trying new things
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:50:51
good man. It will be in the movie one day
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:28:06
I guess the death spiral ended!
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:32:30
to be fair, Kraken seems to be down a few times a month
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:28:52

@_date: 2016-01-17 20:58:24
hahaha the litecoin line made me chuckle
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:44:29
Wow Bitcoin Magnet looks dodgy as fuck haha
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:32:05
Agreed, "THE DEATH SPIRAL BEGINS"
Could he be any more dramatic?
@_date: 2016-01-17 21:10:39
Lets hope they are leaving the exchanges rather than entering

Your remark makes no sense, where does visa come into this?
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:40:41
What he said doesnt even make sense
@_date: 2016-01-22 20:54:11

@_date: 2016-01-20 14:01:59
Yah, long time bitcoiner here. I take your point, but this was a special one ;)
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:51:23
now lets slashdot the comments and let them know
@_date: 2016-01-21 23:49:24
agreed, if coinbase want money to flow through their system then they need to make sure its returned quickly upon request
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:43:52
Apparently not! $398!
