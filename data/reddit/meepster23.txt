Going to poke the hornets nest a bit and throw this out there:
adjective: virtual


    almost or nearly as described, but not completely or according to strict definition.
    "the virtual absence of border controls"
    synonyms:	effective, in effect, near, near enough, essential, practical, to all intents and purposes 
    "a virtual guarantee"
        
        




 &gt;  synonyms: simulated, artificial, imitation, make-believe; 




        "a virtual shopping environment"
        carried out, accessed, or stored by means of a computer, esp. over a network.
        "a virtual library"
Emphasis mine..
So, as a programmer myself, I would consider most anything done on a computer "virtual". Saying bitcoin, or any other crypto currency, is virtual in this context simply means it only exists on a computer.. You can't physically hand me a bitcoin. You can hand me a flash drive with a wallet on it containing bitcoins, but that's still just a flash drive with a representation of those bitcoins on them.
You could theoretically randomly generate arrays of bytes and wind up with someone's bitcoin wallet. You can't do that with anything physical.
Digital may have better connotations for you, and probably some others (personally virtual has no negative connotations for me), and it might even be more descriptive, but saying virtual is flat out wrong just isn't true.
TLDR: Virtual = non-tangible especially when relating to computers. You can't physically hand me a bitcoin, therefore bitcoins aren't tangible and are virtual.
