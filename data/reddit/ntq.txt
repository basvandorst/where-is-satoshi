Thank you for your feedback and close read. As to your critical notes, please keep in mind that this is as brief of an introduction as I could muster, and that these topics come up as we discuss bitcoin in person. There could certainly be a page for concerns around bitcoin, and I will explore how to do this in a brief way. I have generally found people have been able to separate the bad actors from the technology once they understand the technology.

Very good point. A question that comes up often by people who grasp the incentive structure is how miners will be rewarded post block rewards. I'll add more emphasis here

That's an interesting take, thank you. I've found that using the word lottery helps with describing the unpredictability about who will solve the next block, and it creates the parallel that in order to control the blockchain you would need to be able to win the lottery time after time.

I just went and tipped everyone on that thread who seemed interested but had not yet set up a changetip account. Small amounts but hopefully it will reduce the barrier for people who get held up at the purchasing stage. Plus, bitcoin works at any size!
