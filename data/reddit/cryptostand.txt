Been in the game for a while and have learned alot along the years because of loyal peeps in the btc community that take the time to answer questions and help us fulfill our dream. Just makes me proud to see people with such knowledge reaching out hands and humbly pulling the willing towards salvation for the good of human independence.  Kudos to all that have made fortunes but continue to lend a hand to the lost for the greater good. It's almost biblical what we are witnessing. Not a very golf man but I feel blessed that I believed in something so I invested for the big picture and was willing to take a loss for the belief that it was the way it should be and it's growing as intended by the great Nakamoto( with bumps in the road  but that was mathematically figured in of course) and his plan for financial  independence.  
Cheers Mr Nakamoto
