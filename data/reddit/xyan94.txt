Don't worry, if shit is continuing like the last 200 years, we will soon see a revolution. The proletarians will get rid of the bourgeoisie :-)

But it's different if you pay 20.000$ for ONE small piece of 21 million or 100$.. everyone would be mad :-)

Lira lost like 20% of it's value compared to other currencies
Bitcoin is down like 60-70% since a half year, I don't think that be an option

In a bear market like this many people change their alts to btc (or usdt).. because it's still the  crypto
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:05:39
But you don't have the added value from your work, for example factory workers - paid a minimal wage for selling your labor, the added value is for the owner/shareholders.   
How comes that  1% of the population owns like 50% of all global wealth? Just take guys like Jeff Bezos, you can never "work" for that insane amount of money on your own.   
And imo there is no stopping for this, the rich will accumulate more and more over time like they did in the past 200 years 
I don't think typical communism , like the communism countries that failed in the past, is a way, but capitalism isn't either. Not for humanity, not for the planet

 I'm no friend of capitalism, my ideologies and philosophy is rather marxistic, but I don't see the world going that way - it will continue to be a capitalistic system, where the rich only get richer and the social inequality rises until shit gets too unequal and the revolution happens 
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:44:49
So you prefer capitalism that makes the social inequality even bigger, the capitalism that let's companies like nestle exploit you? 
You prefer a rothshield owned central bank over a national one?

You have the private key, you can be kidnapped and tortured, your family/friends can be kidnapped and they demand btc from you, or you can be followed to your home and someone  is gonna break in 
I don't know man it sounds risky in my ears 
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:22:27
You pick a small piece of paper, write down the Key and hide it in your favorite book or whereever you want to. One piece you hide at your grandmas home
Or you usb stick wallet like nano ledger

How can a deflationary currency like Bitcoin ever replace fiat. Deflation isn't good for the economy, it makes people hoard money, why would you spend a btc today when you have 3x the purchasing power some days later

1. Any proof/source? The recently published audit is bullshit just like all the others before, It's based on data that tether gave them

Btc dominance is always high in a bear market because people have most trust in Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-06-15 12:41:44
But how do you want to value things in bitcoin? 1 btc = 1 btc, 1 Orange = 1 Orange, but how many satoshis would you pay for an orange?

No, the fed has control of the government in many countries. John F. Kennedy has tried to free America from the grip of the fed

Since I'm into cryptocurrencies there have been countless ads about worthless shit icos on my facebook, those kind of projects that would be the same with a mysql database. 
It's good that they ban this shit. New people fall for those ads and buy crap. This brings our whole community in a bad spotlight

Wtf is wrong with r/btc ?
It's clearly not r/bch, how could they conquer that subreddit.. level of misinformation and scam is huge :D

What stops the elite (for many it's rothshield, rockefeller family, also the 1%ers like Bill gates, Jeff Benzo etc) from buying in with some hundred million and manipulate the whole market?

Being a gamer all my life I always hated the fact that games don't allow you to sell your hard earned character, items, gold or whatever for fiat $$ 
Some games made it almost impossible to do so, some would ban your character if they find out your about to sell or buy, even though you put hundreds of dollars into their itemshop
Looking forward to a time when it's your digital property and you can do whatever u like with it
