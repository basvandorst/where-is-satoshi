We need to prepare some 12k memes now already just to be safe.

I get what you're saying, and definitely agree that a power law is completely different from an exponential. My objection was just at comparing a graph of log(valuation)-time to one of log(valuation)-users, to show how wrong their understanding was.

Piggybacking off of this, what kind of algorithm is generally used to generate the keys from ones seed? Could I write a simple script myself on my computer to do the job?

I'm sorry for your loss. Depression is hell. I'm reminded of something my ex once told me, who has always suffered from it. We were talking about drugs, and whether we would ever take one kind or the other. She told me that she would never dare to take ecstasy, or any other sorts of uppers, despite knowing that it might help her feel happy for a few hours. Her reason was that she feared the crash that would followed the high, which she had heard would put her further down than she had been before, even if that would eventually go away. She feared what she might do.
The high that your brother must have felt from the thought of soon being rich, and taking care of himself and his loved ones, must have been just incredible. And if he was struggling with depression at the same time, which some of the commenters here suspect, I cannot immagine how far down he fell emotionally, when that one bright thought got taken away.
If he did suffer from depression, your brother might have thought, mistakenly, that bitcoin was his one way out of his misery. In his place, I know I would get consumed by the idea of getting rich. I'm already checking the price several times a day to know how my measly ~0.05 Bitcoin are doing. If I then imagine adding in a depression that takes away all joy, the thought of losing that hope is truly crushing. I hope that you get what I'm trying to say, and that it actually applies here and helps to explain his passing in some sense.

As the other guy said, your friend's friend was probably just talking about exchanges going down momentarily, which is not at all as dramatic as "suddenly locked out" sounds. You can trade your money again as soon as they find a way to handle the added load.
Most exchanges have a status page, where they tell you if something is wrong and if they are getting it fixed. They also usually have graphs of how often they have had problems. Coinbase, in particular, has their status page at:  
  
and other exchanges do as well, like Bitfinex:

What simple minded remark. If a company is being overwhelmed by the surge of requests for their service, that is only a good sign with respect to this market.

You're comparing the graphs assuming that the number of users increases linearly with time. Why would it do that? Anyone will tell you the number of users increases at least exponentially during early adoption.

I want to throw out a thought for people to ponder, which really points out the illusion of inherent value of fiat.
Banks work, simply put, by storing your money and lending it out to others. They get interests off loans and pay you interests on your savings. But an interesting thing happens when someone takes up a loan at a bank.
People don't take up loans and then withdraw them in cash; they put the money back into the bank. Think about that. If I put $100 in a bank, the bank will lend that same $100 to someone else, who then then also places that money in the bank in order to use it. With money in their account they can purchase something, transferring to someone else's bank account, but the cash never leaves the bank.
So how much money does the bank actually have? Both me and the guy who took up the loan would claim to have $100 dollars in our savings account, so you'd think the bank would have $200 in cash in their vaults. But no, they only have my $100. They have effectively created money out of thin air, by the use of loans.
I don't remember the name for this, but its a well understood concept and necessary consequence of running a bank. Different countries have different limits to how much money a bank is allowed to "conjure up" for every dollar that they store, but my main point is this:
A dollar kept in a bank is "backed" by only a fraction of itself.

Imagine the frenzy that is about to go down. So many noobs who have never even seen a HODL-meme. They'll realize that they've doubled their money, and be scared of not selling in time.
I'm thinking the newcomers will panic at 20k or so, causing the long-awaited dip. Unless this wave of adopters comes in at a slow pace, but that seems unlikely with all this sudden attention and coverage.
Either way, I don't mind, cause if I'm right I can get in early on the next wave. And if I'm wrong, at least my BTC rise in value.

The block he mentions mining was probably [number 78]( because that is the only one that has since been spent. He received his 10 BTC from Nakamoto on the twelfth of January, [block 170](
According to the [wiki]( he spent his saved up BTC on treatment as his illness progressed. I am sure it's true he sold some of it, but part of me hopes he used this as an excuse, to protect his family and inheritance.

I'm keeping my BTC for now, but I'm not getting any more before it either reaches 8k or 20k.

You are right to point that out, and I see I didn't make clear the point I had in mind. I wanted to say that we are already used to money being abstracted away from the pieces of paper which "actually have value", to such an extent that much of the money we use has no corresponding dollar bill. We already use electronic money with no 1-to-1 correspondence to actual cash.
E: So I don't get why Bitcoin is so shocking to people.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:04:45
Thank you! I should have looked it up before posting, so I might have come off as more serious.
I'm not saying this is a bad thing btw, I'm just pointing out that  we're already used to dealing with electronic abstractions, and money that isn't backed by anything tangible. Bitcoin shouldn't be as shocking of a concept as it seems to be.

Do you use the non-official reddit app for android? I remember looking at switching not long ago, and when I tried to log in on this other app, there were a ton of terms and conditions that sounded beyond fishy. Like them reserving the right to give up- and down-votes with my account.
I suspect the authors of the app use the accounts that use their service to sell upvotes and downvotes, so anyone that might not like Bitcoin could purchase their service and get everything on here downvoted multiple times. That was what came to mind first, when I saw this.
As others have said, change your password.

This guy, man, I am so happy that this is happening to him. Hearing him talk, you can tell his passion comes from a strong belief in the good that crypto can do for the people of the world. He has given so much for the "other 6.5 billion people", and been forced by circumstance to lose the chance of profiting, the way so many others have done.
The fact that he has not grown rich from Bitcoin until now, *and still* remains passionate in advocating it, is a strong proof of his sincerity. He really deserves to be rewarded for the work he is doing to better the world.

And then on the other hand, Bitcoin is much easier to divide up into little bits, and can be bought completely from anywhere with an internet connection.
Not disagreeing, just saying that both gold and Bitcoin have advantages over the other which make the comparison very limited.

This is why you use a log-scale for crypto price charts.
