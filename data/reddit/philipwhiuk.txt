All of your ideas are interesting. None of them actually require cryptocurrency or a blockchain. Why does a farmer need a blockchain to sell crops.


I mean the giant corps don't just sit around doing nothing. They solve the 'my farm is in Idaho and you live in New York' problem. Also, few people want grain, they want Cheerios.
You should look at the commodity futures market. Farmers already have a way of saying 'ok I'll sell 100 tonnes of grain for next years crop and get $300 a tonne - that means I have X,Y,Z'.


Residential solar is a beautiful idea but in practice it just about breaks even. Anyway, you still don't need cryptocurrency to sell energy on the energy market. You need a meter.


Again, none of this benefits or requires a public ledger of transactions. I buy your design, I pay you in dollars, you give me the CNC file.

Both parts are slightly wrong.
The best strategy is to use a credit card exactly like a normal card. That is, only buy what you can afford. Pay it off automatically at the end of the month. 
The reason for doing this is three-fold.
1. You gain a tiny amount of interest on the money that would have paid off the purchase between the time you buy the item and your card statement.
2. The banks see you as a safe and reliable person, so they are prepared to lend you more on longer term stuff, like mortgages and approve you for phone contracts etc (which again, you should be budgeting for - just because you're approved you still need to check you can afford it).
3. Before you actually pay for the item the bank is effectively liable. If it doesn't work you go to the retailer and say 'it doesn't work'. If they refuse to give you your money back you go to the bank and say 'it doesn't work and so I'm not paying for it'. The bank is now on your side against the retailer. Banks have power here because they will represent lots of potential customers - they may even be the businesses own bank.
And yes, the credit card is also a useful insurance policy. I can walk out the door of my house with my credit card and even if the ridiculous happens and I suddenly get teleported to a foreign country I can use my credit card limit, even if I don't have the money right now, to buy a flight back to the UK. They will lend me this large sum of money because years of me being a reliable bet tells them 'this is a crazy moment but he's a reliable person and will pay us back'.
People with insane credit card debts are being helped into it by card companies that no longer care about the risk of non-repayment. A reasonable lender would refuse payments.
8% interest is not low. 8% interest is colossal and it's colossal because the card companies know that once you fall behind on payments you're a bad risk. They are trying to get something back from that bad risk.
Minimum repayments are the credit card companies way of extracting money from people who don't understand interest.

A future is a contract to buy or sell something at a set price at some point in the future.
For example you can obtain a future to buy 1 barrel of oil for $1000 dollars on 1st February.
In a normal (asset settled) future, on that date, you pay the amount and get your barrels. Now if the oil price is $999 dollars you have lost money on the deal. But if the oil price is $1001 dollars you've gained money. However, either way it provides a guarantee you'll be able to get oil at a pre-determined price.
For Bitcoin (and many other things) you don't actually get the asset. Instead you just get the difference in the price. For example, if the above future was cash settled you'd get $1 if the price was $1001 and pay $1 if the price was $999.

I know people love to make comparisons between BTC and GDP of countries but it's inaccurate. GDP is what countries produce. 
And the truth is if you compare BTC markets to standard financial markets the volumes are just not comparable.
If you take the view BTC/USD is a form of FX (the most accurate comparison, i.e. that BTC is a currency) then the global FX volume is $5.3 trillion a day. At it's peak BTC is doing 442K. It's just such a tiny proportion of trade it's absurd.
If you take the view BTC is a stock, then you can talk about market cap. Except all that really tells you is 'amount of money all BTC is considered worth'. For a company that's useful - it tells you how much the company's worth. For BTC? Not so much.
And then you look at BTC as an asset. The primary comparison point is gold.
However gold is pretty stable currency wise. Like BTC it's not too liquid in purchased form, but it is a lot more stable, financially speaking. If you buy gold, you can be pretty certain of selling it tomorrow at a very similar price. If not, it's not because gold has changed value it's because the economy itself has fundamentally been affected - which is what you're trying to protect against. 
Whereas Bitcoin is too new and too hard to price right now. The HODLing and expectation of bullish behaviour is the greatest weakness for Bitcoin. Because the more unpredictable the pricing, the worse it is a store of money.
Has Bitcoin been a good investment so far? Sure. Is past performance much use for predicting Bitcoin's success? No.
Bitcoin has no fundamentals that say 'it'll be worth more if X'. The only sizeable moves have been based on regulatory decisions - and it's gone up so much anyway so it would have been hard to short a bad regulatory decision (or even pseudo-short by selling existing BTC and buying back).
Outside day-traders (who are all over this I guess), BTC is not a practical asset for an investment bank. It's too small to deal with as FX, it's got not fundamentals so it's hard to price as an equity. Nor is it good for pension funds who are after a dividend.
It's an interesting highly speculative bubbly financial product. But am I surprised it's barely on the radar of big finance? No.

Say you buy 0.1 BTC for $100 and the value of Bitcoin goes up so 0.1BTC is $120 , you are worth $20 more. If you actually sell it you 'realise the profit'.
Likewise if you buy 0.1 BTC for $100 and the value of Bitcoin goes down so 0.1BTC is $80, when you sell it you will have lost $20.
Until you choose to sell the BTC you have bought you have a theoretical profit/loss based on the comparison between the exchange rate you bought in at and sold at.

The order book on the left is unfilled orders. Buys and sells that match don't exist because they are executed. A sell for 4360.99 or less would be matched with the buy and executed. You can see on the right that the executed orders are in that range. Similarly if you put in a buy for more than 4360.70 you'd get executed. The spread is the difference between the buy and sell positions.

There's a legal requirement (as I understand it) for banks to have ATM coverage to allow people to access their money. So banks will often pay shops a tiny fee (for electricity etc) to have an ATM in their shop.
Add to that the fact that (for example) Tesco's is both a bank, supermarket and gas station and that gets you a lot of ATMs for free. Having a Tesco's ATM at a Tesco's petrol pump makes you more likely to use Tesco's services is the theory.

Israel has a population of 8 million and ToI (2012-) reports a readership of 3.5 million. Obviously a lot of that is international. It's probably the biggest online only Israeli-origin publication. Haaretz (1918-) is most well known Israeli publication.
It styles itself as independent. I would have said in terms of quality journalism it's probably somewhere near Huff Po. It's not deep feature investigation like the NYT or Le Monde or something. But it does do it - e.g. a binary options expose.
I think this specific error is because:
1. Newspaper journalists are not familiar with the technology space
2. This especially isn't ToI's raison d'etre. You read it for the material on Palestine and Israel, not developments in cyber space.

If you accumulate as well as hodl your existing ones (into the same address) you'd be able to discount the address. I'd guess most hodlers gradually are accumulating more BTC as well.
And yes, obviously there's going to be lots of false positives.
Of course in the case where it's on a site, they might use one BTC address for multiple people and store the actual values in a DB - then you'd have to check the site's login times. But then they could just withdraw the BTC too so that's not really lost in the standard sense.

As I understand it mining is the process that rewards the verification of the bitcoin chain by providing new bitcoins from a decreasing supply.
What happens to mining when the bitcoin supply runs out? What's the reward for transaction verification post-new BTC?
It also seems to that the BTC price is quite linked to the cost of electricity - because the coin costs electricity to produce, the coin can't be much cheaper than the cost to produce the coin or more people would start mining.
So essentially right now the currency is like an index tracker of world energy prices - with some complications to come when the value halves.
So what happened at the last halving event to the BTC price?

In regulated markets you're required to disclose your position. For exampled if you have significant BTC holdings or even are shorting BTC you have to disclose that.
The larger the volume the asset class the less stringent the requirement. For ICOs the volume is lower than for FOREX so the requirement would be stricter. It's hard for an individual to significantly impact the USD so generally there's no requirement.
Tech sites like Wired already have writers who disclose cryptocurrency positions:

Regulation isn't about reducing risk. It's about people being aware of the risks they are taking. It's about people who aren't financially savvy not being lied to by people about the risk. It's about people not being taken for a ride by their retirement savings being deceptively put in worthless stocks and investment vehicles.
For example, say I'm responsible for investing a company's pensions and I know that Big Corp Ltd is about to go bankrupt and I also own lots of Big Corp shares. Regulation stops me selling my shares to the company I'm investing in at a stupidly high price so I make a sweet buck and they lose all their money.
If your response is 'But Financial Crisis', yes, this is **because** regulations were removed. It's also because it wasn't obvious what money was being invested in. Hence Dodd-Frank and MiFID 2.

By Bitcoin I really meant 'the Bitcoin ecosystem' (trust&amp;electricity (PoW), bitcoin, lightning channel, ?). When I said fiat, I meant the physical coinage ecosystem (gold, dollar, note, cheque, digital transaction).
The Bitcoin coin is built on top of a number of commodities. It's a combination of trust and electricity. Like the current coinage, Bitcoin changes the amount of electricity needed to mint a coin in terms of better minting processes (ASICs). You could also argue that like coins, the desire to exchange them easier is also reducing the other commodity requirement (trust) in each unit of currency. Lightning minimizes the verification requirements to obtain a Bitcoin. Similarly a note minimises the gold requirements to obtain a dollar. 
I was merely arguing that to be a fully functioning societal fiat replacement, there needs to be a card/cash version. Potentially you have ability to repudiate but the appearance is a transaction that the vendor can be fairly confident is unlikely to be revoked. "Lightning without the enforced wait". "Low Sec Lightning". Because of course fraudulent dollars and credit cards exist and are used to make payments. In the real world that 1% risk has been worth the easy exchange of goods.

Say the price is $50 and the current market price is $50 for 1 BTC and the fluctuation is $10. You charge 1.2 BTC.
Within a given window of time, you wait for the best price. If it goes above a given value (say $55), you sell the BTC. If it goes lower than a certain threshold, you also sell. You'll make a loss on that trade but not overall (because of your inherent profit of 0.2BTC per item &amp; any trading wins.
Periodically you re-price the items.
The more you buy and sell the lower the risk because you can wait longer when you have a consistent supply of BTC payments.

~~No. The moneyness is $20. Per Investopedia and Wikipedia. Where's your source.~~
Hmm, maybe you are right. Wikipedia and Investopedia insufficiently explain the ratio nature. 
But this still isn't what that chart shows. USD doesn't have a moneyness ratio of 1200
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:50:15
Nah a few people still read it.

Actually, in reliability it's more common to hear a service managing 'four 9s' or 'five 9s'. In this case Bitcoin has four 9s.
Also 4 9s is &lt; 1 hr. 3 9s is 8 hrs.

The real reason is that the base currency is gold.
I mean fine, but it's a poor chart where you use something other than the global reserve currency without stating it.
It also raises the question of what gold is being priced in. Gold can't ipso facto be being paid for for more than the price of gold.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:50:55
Still less than Bitcoin.

If it were in City AM (free) or the FT maybe.
* City AM - free financial paper
* Metro - free morning tabloid
* Evening Standard - free newspaper

But moneyness of what unit.
For an IBM stock priced in $s the moneyness might be $5. It's not 5.
For FOREX the moneyness of JPY/USD is in USD. For USD/JPY it'd be in JPY.
But it can't be dollars, because dollars is on the list.
Thus I suspect the slide deck isn't using the dollar. Thus it should state units.
Oh and furthermore, the fact that the strike price of a starbucks card is nearer to the current price would make it more useful. Even the idea of a real strike and current price for much of that list is laughable.

It's the (London) Evening Standard. If you want a free paper on the markets you get City AM and if you want to pay you get the FT. Nobody reads the business section.
They've had E-Toro crypto betting in the sheet for a while.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:30:57
Okay, I'll bite.
You can have a term that means 'more useful as currency', involving stuff like liquidity.
But you can't use moneyness, because it's already got a definition in finance.
Have 'money-esque'.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:51:36
That's like saying it's not an outage because Ethereum still existed. Temporarily it was only possible to spend neoBitcoin, not Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's network has been offline during an upgrade that went wrong. But trying to explain "upgrade" to you would be a waste of time.

Well my bank doesn't charge me for transactions. So get a new bank.
But I don't have to use my bank to pay my friend in $s. I have to use and pay Bitcoin miners to pay my friend in BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:53:04
Not the definition of moneyness.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:07:58


Not really. It's because it's decentralized that makes downtime hard to define.
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:39:55

All securities have a currency attached. Boeing is sold in dollars. Forex is sold in the denominator currency.
If the trading price of Boeing is $50 and the strike price is $30, the moneyness is $20 and in the money. You might write 20, but only because  Boeing is assumed to always sold in dollars.
Trading platforms might suggest you can buy Boeing in BTC, but all you're really doing is a BTC/USD trade and then a Boeing trade and you're both regulated by the SEC for trading dollars and exposed to exchange rate changes.
If Boeing listed in BTC that would be a cross listing which is rare. When we see companies listed in BTC then I'll say it's a true dollar replacement :)
And again, none of the helps the dollar have a none-zero moneyness.

1. I'm not in the US.
2. My life isn't shit.
3. The US government isn't running concentration camps and gas chambers.
4. You think the European banking system won't do something similar? There's already equivalent laws on Euros.

Most likely he's in a country with a passport that makes that at best expensive and at worst impossible.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:43:10
My guess given he's using a translator.
He's in a country which has US sanctions against it. Binance is in the US and the US government has impounded his dollar-valued BTC as a result.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:46:38
Or just avoiding US sanctions.

This is what BTC proponents said about taxes, right up until the IRS came knocking.
Besides painting the US as a Nazi state is just ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:50:30
They took scientists who worked under the Nazi regime yes. Except the ones the Europeans and Russians took under Operation Backfire and Operation Osoaviakhim.
Securing military intelligence on rocketry doesn't make the whole of the US a Nazi state.
Nazi exactly invokes concentration camps and ghettos and gas chambers. Building a few long range rockets is not a war crime.

Because he's ignored the simple fact that Binance basically doesn't have a choice but to comply with US financial regulatory activity and is just hounding them for it.
