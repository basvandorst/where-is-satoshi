Totally appreciate and respect that opinion. We're super small right now (basically my wife and I running the business). Over the next while we're hoping to scale things up so we can reduce our prices. For now, we've factored in time and material costs and came up with $10 per pack :)

Yeah we're based in Canada which makes our shipping pretty crazy especially when it goes internationally. We lose money on our US orders and all of our international shipping is carrier calculated. Sorry. Shipping is literally the hardest thing about running an online store.

Thanks! Sorry for the typo

We posted this in last week and a few people mentioned that we should post it here since we proudly accept bitcoin. 
FYR we run our store on Shopify which offers amazingly easy bitcoin integration with Coinbase.

Wait, do you guys _actually_ think this is just salt? :troll:
@_date: 2015-05-02 02:54:26
If anything is going to make shit taste good, it's our salt :)

Sorry, I should say that we charge less for shipping than what we pay. So we will make money, but shipping erodes our profits.

I think he might be talking about the salt that you put on roads in winter :)
