What if you make multiple transactions between coins on an exchange or multiple exchanges? USD to BTC. BTC to LTC. LTC to USD to ETH to a different exchange. I’m currently dealing with having my investment sent from btc-e from 4 years of trading on there nearly to being sent to WEX and have no idea how to reach btc-e for my transaction history. How do I prove what my initial investment was years ago? Will WEX have my transaction history? It didn’t transfer over when I was able to access my account again.

thats why I'm trying to buy coin and move it elsewhere. Bitfloor had a direct transfer with BoA. I have $1400 sitting in there waiting to go to coin, but it seems right about now i have to pay about 145 per. I was watching the only other exchange I know of so far, btc-e, and its about 11 USD cheaper :/ . I feel my need to get into the market outweighs my upfront losses. Is there a way to transfer my USD to another exchange without taking such a loss at bitfloor? Which exchanges are preffered, and generally what size differential am i looking for in buy/sell orders percentage wise to be a profitable day trader? I bought a couple of books a few years back on following trends and day trading, but I wasn't ready then. Do the same rules apply to normal stock exchanges as to this, and is this considered part of FOREX?

Just USD at the moment, but its sitting in bitfloor. I was very spontaneous about this, and I couldn't find a tangible way to get my money in fast elsewhere. My wallets are taking forever to sync, probably because my computer is about 4 or so years old. Inexperience is my worst enemy. Arbitrage in the idea I buy on one market, put it in my wallet, and sell it on another market for profit or at least lessen the damage? Do I incur fees for pulling from one exchange to another? I appreciate the input.

The friend who told me about bitcoin has one verified. I'm sure i could put it in his account until mine becomes verified. Im looking to actually trade it to litecoin because the market is in an earlier stage. I like having more shares that can fluctuate in large amounts then a few shares of larger value, in a somewhat more stable platform. As I said, I'm brand new to trading. I appreciate all of your insight as I need as much as possible to better understand what I'm getting into.
