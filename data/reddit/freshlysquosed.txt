No, he really didn't.

Couldn't he do that anonymously? 
@_date: 2015-12-09 13:00:18


How would this happen?

muh dreams

If you have 100k debt you voluntarily agreed to that shit and owe it back.

Maybe you were, I don't live in a fairytale.

I'm not sure what the link is there, but I would say no, not morally. Lots of people use heroin, cars, fast food, etc responsibly... are the "pushers" of those things all responsible for the user's nice actions too?

Do you think higher fees and longer wait times will, over time, hurt its utility?
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:12:50
Gold is actually worth something because it's backed by something valuable that's used. Bitcoin isn't. The value is in its use, as I understand it.
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:23:00


Why's that?
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:59:36
It seems like it would be a really easy crime to get away with, like murder.
Prediction: it will be attempted, but it will be a hoax.

I meant actual value, i.e. gold has a ton of uses. Bitcoin really doesn't if it's not used as a value store.


It's open source, anyone can duplicate it. Also, would anyone use it if bitcoins were $0.01 each?


I'm not sure price is a reflection of much.

I'm going by the Peter Schiff vs Molyneux debate I watched several years ago. Schiff's argument was that there's nothing backing bitcoin, where gold actually has other valuable uses. Molyneux's argument was that the utility, i.e. what it enables users to do, was what 'backed' (not really, but in another sense) bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-17 14:27:23
Yeah, its utility. It's becoming less and less useful, no?
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:03:33
Thanks for your input. I haven't had the time to keep up with the debates.

Does a tx for a board game need those features?

Currently both are an option, I guess in the future only lightening could be, but there'll always be other crypto you could use for that should it be needed.

english is bs i dont even understand it
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:34:58
that is bs. i don't even understand
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:01:46
you sound really informed and in a position to be calling things bs
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:46:37
i dont understand. youre talking bs

Not to mention, I’m pretty sure anyone using that Bitcoin ATM already has their identity compromised.
\&gt; Sounds exhausting for the average person.
You just buy the bitcoin and then send it... What's exhausting exactly?

Who are these thot leaders he's referring to?
@_date: 2015-10-10 13:38:24


You could just show the transaction, no? Put the coins through a tumbler and cash out.
@_date: 2015-10-10 14:47:50
What's suspicious about it? The other trader wouldn't know that it's going to be you.


Well that's the goal, and I think there's a million ways to use it.


Well it's more than a few percent isn't it?
