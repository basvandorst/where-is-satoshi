U.S. dollar loses value every year too.

I think you’re right. I can see this technology being needed for augmented and virtual realities, when it starts getting advanced to the point of people spending a lot of their daily lives in them. New economies could sprout in the future digital world needing this level of decentralized security.

It’s a $40k-$50k vehicle with one of the highest resale values of all vehicles. Also one of the top ten most durable longest lasting vehicles on the road. I don’t see a problem with it.

Seriously, dont trade if this is your logic bro, you will lose all your money.
@_date: 2019-06-30 21:22:53
Why would anyone use only one indicator? That is foolish.
Aaand most people fail at trading...

90% of traders, the losers. I use to be one

I seize opportunities when they arise. Day trading is just as stressful as swing trading and you can be hit with nasty swings or stopped out in a wick just as easily as swing trading. Dont be afraid of using stablecoins if you actually wanna be profitable. Its all about risk management for both styles. When i start feeling more comfortable in a swing, ill increase position size on supports. Ive found the secret to be proper laddering and risk management for both styles. Never tie up all your capital.

Dude is a parasite
@_date: 2019-06-10 14:11:43
Lol dont swing trade because of risk, yet hold and put profits into alts? Why would you not trade with a stablecoin?
You do realize charts are fractal, how can you recommend day trading and advise against swing trading...
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:02:52
You’re getting lucky then bro. You’re taking no fundamentals or chart technicals into mind. This strategy will burn you up over time. Read and learn about technical trading and stay updated on fundamentals if you’re interested in trading. Being profitable is not this simple.

If this were true you wouldn’t have started this thread. The trend that you are trading/relying on will break, and then youll end up digging yourself into a hole. I guarantee you.

Has this strategy proven itself profitable over the course of months for you? You may get lucky a few times but I promise you, this is not how professional traders operate. Its way more complex than this. Ill bet money that you lose in the long run chasing this strategy. Honest friendly advice.

Ok buddy

Spotting rsi divergence and other patterns have been a pretty big winner in my experience. You’re not using it correctly, its not going to spell out when to buy/sell for you.
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:42:13
Same, everyone thought i crazy. But now they’re interested above 8k. My one buddy has already bought and sold at a loss twice in the past month lol. Some people will never understand.

Yes, the Coinbase bcash scandal is a prime example of why they are trash.

Im getting rewarded BAT for viewing ads right now. On Brave
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:50:25
Just released yesterday, on desktop only right now though

Brave has already stated that they are not limited to being an ERC-20 token forever. They are definitely supporters right now but are not doomed if ETH fails.
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:31:53
What do you mean by advertising backdoors? Brave does not store your info anywhere. Their ad pairing mechanics do not require data to leave your computer. They have a built in private tor tab, and are talking about building an integrated VPN that you can pay in BAT to use. Plan to integrate a P2P eth wallet. Sounds pretty privacy oriented to me. Aside from the ad network, which you can turn off, there seems to be a lot going for this browser.

Yea these numbers are bullshit, absolutely no way.
