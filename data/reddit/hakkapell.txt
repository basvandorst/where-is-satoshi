Someone up the chain might have to only snort coke off of a $10,000/night escort's ass 5 days a week instead of 7, can you imagine the absurdity?

And also makes looking at a page full of large numbers confusing, just a shit system in general.

Anyone who does anything with crypto needs good opsec, you don't want people knowing that you have thousands of dollars tied up in the various electronic devices in your home. It sounds silly, but all it takes it for rumor to travel until some tweaker hears it and suddenly your house gets broken into.

As others have already said, misleading article is misleading.

"The issues with fiat aren't related to the underlying idea, just a result of irresponsible fiscal policy."

... Except that when you're talking about the "quality" of "how long has this thing been around", the "quality" is basically a ratio of how long it's been around to how much drama/instability it's faced. BTC hasn't been around long and there have been plenty of issues with it.

Bit of context, you can buy an item called a Bond from Jagex, which is either used for in-game premium membership or premium currency. The difference between gold farmers and Jagex is that gold farmers flood the game with raw materials versus Jagex's RMT being something that more or less has its own economy and doesn't influence other parts of the game.
No amount of someone buying bonds is going to effect a legitimate player's ability to make money, whereas bot farms both decrease the price of items players would be collecting and cause competition at the various places the bots farm. People will talk about buying gold "devaluing the achievements of others", but realistically very few people do that, the previously mentioned decrease in value of items and increased competition is what actually fucks with the game. From 2011-mid2012 there were so many bots that there would literally be 2-10 bots for every resource node, it was almost impossible to actually play the game.
