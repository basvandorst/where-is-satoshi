Each and every subreddit is allowed to enable or disable each of the bots so that this type of thing doesn't "spam" up the comment section. Plus, for the dogetipbot you can add the verify tag to the end to reduce the amount of spamming involved.

What about simply buying ammo? I can't find any .380 ammo around my area for my handgun and it's really beginning to bug me. Possible for simply buying ammo only for bitcoin?

Alright Reddit... I'm going to speak my opinion on this in hopes of being educated in the end. This type of topic is the reason I have not gone full board with Bitcoin as of yet. These coins are gone forever, no returns. I'm just imagining that even the "average" user of the coins will lose them simply due to technical reasons more than not. If everyone loses them, then how can we trade, buy and sell them. There will be no more left, thus, no one else wanting them in the end.
