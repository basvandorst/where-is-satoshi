That's 65 million dollars, it seems like hacking exchanges is the new bank robbery of the modern era, except you can do it from your computer in your underwear!

As much as I believe in Bitcoin, the volatility would make this a horrible idea.

To a certain degree hes not wrong and consistency is very hard to find in the wine tasting business. Further, its known that most wine tasting is junk-science and has mostly no objective basis. 
This has been published over and over, it has nothing to do with belittling something, its more to do with exposing something for what it is and if that doesn't live up to your expectations, well your expectations are the thing you need to reconsider, not the fact at hand.

This new mycelium entropy gadget looks very promising !

Just signed up! This seems pretty cool, il set up an order when I get home. My UID is 1000001061.

Thats what got me into the crypto space, but I find myself having much more diversified interests of late. I'm thankful for dogecoin as it got me introduced but I find myself more interested in Bitcoin as it is the best chance at crypto in my opinion. Again, thanks for doing your work guys! 
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:13:55
Thanks for doing this amigo!

Amazing story! This needs to be replicated elsewhere. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:06:16
Happy cakeday dear friend :) Have a bit-full day &lt;3
@_date: 2014-07-05 13:52:51
Spread the love :D
@_date: 2014-05-29 18:06:22
Its pretty cool how can send the equivalent of so many day to day items so people so they automaticaly know the value of the transaction, really good idea to help make it more approchable! :)
@_date: 2014-07-18 01:01:14
I completely agree with you, I just meant that its normal there is resistance even though knowledge and understand would make the transition much quicker. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 04:08:46
Cheers random kind stranger!
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:48:20
It seems kind of naive to expect the "establishment" to die off (even if they were, they would do something to stop that). This is just a way for them to make this more attractive to others by infusing some bank regulation shenanigans. 
I agree that the way bitcoin was conceived is superior to what we currently have but to expect the governments to simply drop what they have and move to it is a farytail. People dont like change, especially when they dont understand it. Further, greed (mostly, that).

You should really consider looking into what the *real* intrinsic value of the dollar is, you will be surprised when you find out. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 18:08:52
Thanks for the update guys! Cant wait to get mine :) 
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:31:37
This isn't about surviving, its about helping others, bitcoin clearly fills a gap in the market. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:02:13
Tip love! Instead of war, since its just better that way :)
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:36:20
I would tip you kind sir, but I do not have any bits. Cheers to you!
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:38:07
Cool concept but I find the voice too annoying =P
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:12:28
You hit the nail on the head, but I could imagine the hosting site (BitTorrent) to block any duplicates of the same content. This would still lead to a walk-a-mole-type game..perhaps only give the permission to content creators to post...but then you limit yourself in terms of content availability...is there a better compromise?
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:33:00
Not necessarily, it's generally stated as being "all relevant information". In any case, I'm not here to defend the theory, simply putting a name to what you mentioned :) 
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:34:34
The best price to buy at? Market price. 
@_date: 2016-12-27 17:09:01
Well that is the [Efficient Market Hypothesis!]( Feel free to read more about it and decide yourself how applicable you think it is.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:20:22
Its the white paper, if your familar with academic publications its similar to a research article, providing the proof of concept for bitcoin and its uses for the first time (I believe?)
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:18:47
Perhaps include shipping to Canada? Your northern friends want some love too! 
@_date: 2015-07-25 04:34:09
Honestly I would rather just form a word composed of roman letters so its easily type-able. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:03:05
Doesn't sound like a lot for someone of his stature.
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:29:21
That still doesn't mean you should stick with a sinking ship. Not that Bitcoin is one but the point stands! 
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:42:21
Satoshi Sunday, catchy haha ;) 
Not to be a drag, but maybe instead pool all of the btc and make a donation to Nepal?
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:03:39
Empty threats are issued by everyone and their uncle, following through is quite rare because it actually demands time and commitment haha
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:21:31
Hola amigo
@_date: 2015-03-13 21:23:44
1 - No
2 - Looks like a respectable place to get some btc 
3 - The fact I haven't tried it yet 
@_date: 2015-03-25 02:43:19
This is one is a classic for ya! 
You can never lose a homing pigeon - if your homing pigeon doesn't come back, what you've lost is a pigeon.

Morning, get some coffee!
@_date: 2015-02-02 03:50:27
Spread all the bits! 
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:20:50
Good on you!
