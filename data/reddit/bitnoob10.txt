This worked! Thanks.
Some funky things have been happening. I sent my btc from imported blockchain.info wallet to a new bitcoinqt wallet/address (encrypted). The funds were there in an instant, but the backup created from the original encrypted wallet would not update. Hmm 
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:36:36
it's at 6 confirmations in the blockchain... nothing in the wallet. WTF?
@_date: 2013-05-02 06:01:45
Should I at least see unconfirmed transactions? Or is the fee to move  the funds? if so, the funds have been moved... I am not understanding bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:21:00
Yeah... green check mark in the bottom right corner. Up-to-date when I hover over it. 
Only 8 active connections though... dunno if that matters. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:34:03
would this cause it to not appear in unconfirmed transactions ?
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:27:18
Yeah, restarted the client. 
I went to the "Received Coins" Tab, right clicked the address, clicked copy and put it into blockchain.info. 
the blockchain reports the correct amount of btc, but the wallet is not. Not even unconfirmed coins.

I've encrypted the wallet... will the .info site just prompt for the password before sending to a new address?

I have the wallet.dat with the address holding the 10btc. I have compared the "receiving" address in the wallet with the address in the blockchain... it matches, but there are no funds in the wallet 
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:24:01
Yes bitcoinQT. 
There was odd behavior for that transfer though.... I was not prompted for a transaction fee (first time that has happened). Would I not see it in unconfirmed transactions? The blockchain is reporting 3 confirmations.

I've noticed that I only have 8 active connections to the bitcoin network... does this maybe have something to do with it?
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:39:50
I have been using it to send/receive. Decided to send all my coins to a new address in a new wallet. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:34:55
and if so, what are the confirmations for? 
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:10:56
Yeah. This has never happened to me. I always see unconfirmed funds at the very least. I've double checked everything and the address that now has the funds is a receiving address in the new wallet. What gives?
