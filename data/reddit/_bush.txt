Is 0.5mBTC (3mBTC/kb) too low of a transaction fee?
I wonder if I should wait or just increase my fee already.

Thank's for the detailed answer. So difficulty is proportional to the nethash, that makes sense. I think I get it now :)

Hey, I have a simple question for you guys.  
Correct me if I'm wrong, but mining only gets more difficult over time, since block mining reward halves every x mined blocks, right? That is, the average mining cost can never get cheaper, only more expensive.   
With that in mind, what would happen if bitcoin's market price were to drop below the average mining cost? No one will mine it at a loss (unless they enjoy wasting money) and the mining cost can't go down, so what would happen to bitcoin? I guess no new coins would be mined, and no transactions would be made without miners, and a currency that you can't send or receive would soon be worth nothing.
Now I'm sure I'm missing some important thing because the developers must've thought about this scenario and a solution for it.

Can you explain how that works briefly? I thought the difficulty was a function of the number of mined blocks, not the number of people mining.

Hmm I see.

Makes sense, but I don't have any money to invest. =(  
My friend gave me that small fraction of Bitcoin in exchange for a favour.

More specifically: to live off of my bitcoin fortune.

Thanks, I will look into that.

Okay guys, I just did it. Paid the suggested "regular" fee of 1.78 USD.
So, now what sort of precautions should I take?  
As long as I have my encryption password safe and my seed, I have access to my money, correct?
