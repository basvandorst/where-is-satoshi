Money doesn't bring happiness, but it does give you a feeling of security, which takes a massive load off your shoulders. 
Your doing it right. You'll find something / someone to spend that money on one day. Living life and enjoying yourself is way more important than spending money just because you have it. 
I suggest going travelling by yourself for a while as it brings perspective and let's you really think about what you want to accomplish in life. On a personal level it's very fulfilling.

Big blocks are just a 'lets add another motor' solution to a car that needs to go faster. You can add a few, but eventually you can't scale it up anymore. 
The correct, and less 'hacky' way to do it is to add a layer above Bitcoin which processes transactions faster, feeding them down to Bitcoin as needed. 
In saying that, increasing the blocksize right now would alleviate some of the pressure and high transaction fees.

How many of you watched BTC from the beginning and how many jumped in during the last year? If it wasn't for people like this, willing to take the risk, BTC wouldn't be what it is today. This goes for both the employer and employee.
*Hurr Durr, lol some idiot brought pizza for a billion dollars, someone brought weed for 50k, someone spent 3mil buying a fake house in an online game...*
If it wasn't for those people, none of this would be happening now. This kind of stuff legitimises the value of BTC, and its utility. 
We should all be supporting him 100%! This kind of thing is pioneering and all you fucken cry babys are calling him out for it. Grow up and start leading the way, like op.

This is the initial, bare bones implementation. It's the underlying logic of the network without abstraction. 
You don't complain that looking up a website is confusing, but it's super technical and not at all intuitive at its core. That shit got abstracted away long ago, and all your left with is a simple, human readable interface. 
The plan is to have lighting operate the same, abstract away the technical side of it until it's simple.

My man, love the enthusiasm but I think you're being a bit too optimistic with your understanding of Bitcoin. 
There was no overthrowing planned, nor was their a revolution or a 'flippining', or any other kind of cyber-nerd fantasy. It's all a fairy tale fueled by over enthusiast followers who think they're part of some sort of global awakening. I mean, I'm all for it but don't discount we could be wrong... there are, unfortunately, a shit-tonne of people who just don't give 2 flying fucks about any of this crypto-whats-it-hoo-har. 
Of course, we now have the means to be slightly more independent from government and other money-making machines, but it really doesn't mean much when everything else is so deeply rooted in these traditional systems. But one step is obviously better than none, right! Keep fighting the good fight.
At its core, Bitcoin is primarily a way to provide digital ownership. A byproduct of digital ownership is scarcity. A byproduct of scarcity is value. It's cool tho, because I think it's fucken awesome. But not the fairy tale jizz-gasmic nerd revolution everyone's been hyping up. 
Stay cool my rubber band man. I agree with you in spirit, but it'll take a lot more than getting angry on the internet to flip them tables. Peace. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:48:00
Because they know store of value trumps limited real world application every single time. 
Buying coffee is 100x easier with cash. Why try force crypto in there? It's slower and less convenient for the coffee shop, plus nobody uses it unless just for novelties sake. I'm not sure why you think buying coffee is a legitimate crypto use case.

There's only 1 of this picture I painted, but it's not worth that much. Scarcity doesn't necessarily relate to value, but real world application does. 
We won't see those prices until it actually has some utility. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 02:35:17
But it's only worth 1/10 the price of BTC and has 1/10 the traffic. Why isn't it worth the same if it's exactly the same? 
I'll answer that for you, because it's a direct copy without any added value whatsoever. And the general public in agreement judging by the usage and price. 
Since the split it's lost a ton of value, where as BTC has increased. The people have spoken.

As the world becomes more connected it makes sense at an economic level to have a permissionless, global, digital currency which is native to the internet... Just like anyone under 30 is. 
Nobody said we do, but you can't always wait for those people to give you permission.

Bitcoin is 10 years old and every day for those 10 years I've heard someone like you chime in with some 'bubble, too expensive, gonna crash' retorhic.  
Do you know what I've learnt over those 10 years? Nobody has any fucken idea what they're taking about. Especially those who think they do.

Because we're just about to see an entire generation enter the market who were &lt; 10 years old when btc was discovered. 
They're certainly native internet users, and don't really remember a time before crypto. To them, it's how the world is and has always been. It's normal.

The issue with banks is the crazy and unneeded amount of money, resources and manpower spent on wrapping layers and layers of security around, not only the source of truth (central database), but also the infrastructure to do with transacting between financial institutions. 
It's literally security through obscurity mixed with close source, propiotory software built in the 80s. They're all locked into a shitty, old-school model and can't get out. 
If you remove the core, and all of the shit which supports it (90% of the resources) then you can still have a business model by inserting crypto (super lean) and building up a use case for customer anonymity and some sort of key storage facility (think biometrics/chip + physical lockboxes + whatever) which provides users with piece of mind.
The main problem with crypto for the average punter is the stress of storing keys. This needs to be overcome before any kind of adoption. 
Banks can still exist, but they're just thin wrappers around crypto.

I never brought crypto. I mined it and worked/traded it. Not everyone is in it to fill their pockets. Some people want adoption. 
Just because that's completely incomprehensible to you, doesn't mean it's not real. Open your eyes and stop looking at the ground in front of your feet.

Honestly, what people think doesn't matter at all. You could ask everyone in the entire world which way it'll go and it'd still be a guess at best.
The majority of people on reddit don't have any influence over the price of bitcoin, nor do they know what they're talking about. You should always take any strong opinion with a grain of salt, it usually means they don't know much about the subject they're talking about.

I know this is a joke and all that, but Bitcoin isn't supposed to be a magic pot of gold so you can personally  get rich. It's a way to decouple ourselves from any dictorial dependences and to allow free trade P2P. 
Making money is an awesome byproduct, but it's a very selfish agenda.

Every single increase has a measurable affect on decentralization. That's a fundamental law of nature. How much affect is subjective and circumstantial.
BTC is focusing on distribution and decentralization at its core. The more people who have access, the better it is for all. It's a long term goal, one step at a time. 
BCH is focused on utility, and making it useful right now, while sacrificing the core principals which BTC was originally intended for - decentralization and incorruptibility. People don't like BCH because, 1. it fundamentally goes against the original concept, and 2. It's marketed like some titty show in the bad part of town.
