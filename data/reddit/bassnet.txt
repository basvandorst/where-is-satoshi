The amount of work MIT students get is staggering... I know a couple, and they get very little sleep throughout the week (they're studying engineering). I don't think it's that the students aren't interested, but that they just don't have any time.

Does anybody know wtf is going on? The price has been jumping around all day. I swear it dropped like $30 in the last 15 minutes.

Not sure what OP is talking about but it's been pretty unstable all day

You can use local bitcoins or a bitcoin ATM with cash and that can usually be done anonymously

Why would you buy now? It's crashing

The DEA is a total waste of resources and is entirely corrupt. It's a department that lives in the past and refuses to accept scientific proof. We should do away with them entirely, but there's no way in hell Trump is gonna allow that.

Yeah it's very strange, they even give a tx id that isn't real (nothing shows up on block explorers)

If they are of European ancestry then yes, they are "white people." Of course that is assuming that in this context "white" is synonymous with "Europid" as race does not depend on religion (and vice versa).    
From Wikipedia: [The contemporary usage of "white people" or a "white race" as a large group of (mainly European) populations contrasting with "black", American Indian (sometimes called red), "colored" or non-white originated in the 17th century.](

I completely agree with you - why blame an entire race on the actions of a few? It's illogical. That was my argument.

I use Coinbase which randomly generates/recycles addresses for every transaction
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:00:02
That's because coinbase isn't your bank, it's a currency exchange service. If you try to convert dollars to euros at a currency conversion kiosk you'll be hit with a conversion fee (or shitty exchange rate). Bitcoin is not paper money, it's entirely electronic.

We'll all be dead by the time that happens

The ATM near me is listing the buy price at 833.48 which is totally off. And on top of that there's an 8% fee. I'm trying to buy bitcoin, not get robbed here!

Was planning on it but now I think I'll just hold on to them

Again with the blanket statements... The largest banks in the world are also owned by white people. And the federal reserve is run by white peoole too. As a matter of fact white people run the upper class and have caused genocide, apartheid and slavery many times throughout history. So why not just blame everything on white people? I'll tell you why - because that is a blanket statement, or a [hasty generalization]( It's a fallacy.

So should we expect it to go back to $1000 soon?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:36:04
Doesn't a huge sell wall usually cause the price to decrease?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:44:08
Yeah looks like someone (or people) sold 630, then 800, then 630
