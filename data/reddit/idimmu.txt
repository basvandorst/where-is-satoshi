I was going to open a bitcoin cigar ecommerce store last year, but the proof of age burden was grinding your gears. How are you going to make sure you don't serve tabacco products to minors and violate what ever laws abound?
If you're going to demand proof of age documents, what's your plan for managing them, storing them securely, confirming them and making the whole process not a huge pain in the ass?

Wouldn't it be better to donate to the guys that make the films you are pirating?

UK trading standards specifically states that that is not enough
* relying on the purchaser confirming they are over the minimum age
* asking the purchaser simply to provide a date of birth
* using tick boxes to ask purchasers to confirm they are over the minimum age
* using a general disclaimer such as 'anyone ordering this product from our website will be deemed to be at least 18'
* using an 'accept' statement for the purchaser to confirm they have read the terms and conditions and they are over the minimum age
* using e-payment services such as PayPal, Nochex or Worldpay. These services may require a customer to be over 18, but they may not verify a user's age
I wouldn't be surprised if other countries are similar, and for cases of entrapment or angry parent syndrome it's a pretty big risk to your business and profit margin.

lets be honest, the goal of this isn't to tip for good service, it's purely to spread the idea of bitcoin around, improve it's circulation and expand it's ability to be used. if it was just about tipping, you'd leave normal currency.

A correctly configured web server would protect from DDOS due to people hitting their API too frequently, this is not necessary and there are many free open source solutions to prevent things like this (e.g. mod_security for Apache)

ok trying this method.. transferwise wants me to specify the ACH and account number of the recipient .. but bitstamp is giving me an IBAN and account number for some account in the UK and then a BIC for somewhere in Slovenia .. ??

yeah, im really liking this Tom guy, really all 4 of them are doing a great and honest job, but you're right, we've still got to sit through the news papers tomorrow :/
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:29:32
the latter, for sure. use the twitter api

it means someone advertised a link with their amazon affiliate code in it on that bitcoin ad network

yeah, almost twice the price of mtgox at the moment :(

lol one question im interested in the answer to, will running bitcoind do any mining? looking at the debug.log it looked like it was processing blocks in some way, possibly it was just examining them for relevant transactions to the wallet, bit i wasnt sure if it was actually doing crunching on the side too?

What are the technological, social and political hurdles you've had to overcome to create Mt. Gox and applicable to Bitcoin?

I don't know about the OP but in the UK passports are small books bigger than any wallet, whenever I travel I always keep them in separate pockets and keep my tickets inside my passport, rather than my wallet. This situation is completely conceivable.
My Lithuanian friend on the other hand has a credit card sized passport she keeps in her purse with all her other cards.

This is awesome, well done guys

As someone in the UK, Bitcoins are pretty much impossible to purchase here. Even the Sofort method doesn't seem to work. Barrier to entry is pretty fucking high.

er what, youve heard of the silkroad right?
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:11:02
they're called turrent phones and they're used for trading
@_date: 2013-06-02 12:34:23


this kind of requirement dilutes bitcoin from being a currency to just being another method of money transfer

Yeah, my friend's dad got a redundancy settlement in a lump sum, something like £60k went straight in to his bank account.
The police came round the next day. This is standard practice, has been for decades, and isn't the banking institution picking on bitcoin.

the article said £750 pounds worth, at the £3 a pint they mention (seriously, £3 a pint in london???) that's 250 pints of beer
