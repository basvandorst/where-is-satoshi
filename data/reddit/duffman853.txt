Hahaha losing money....not if you bought in 2012. You really are extremely optimistic for a currency to fail when USD has been shit since the feds got their fat fingers in the honey pot.

Okay well newbie post here. I bought back in June of 2017 and all I used was just coinbase and binance and that's the only time I bought in but it was a significant amount to say the least. Past couple of months I've been seeing more negative attraction towards their service they offer. I have been hodling with no intent to move what I have already placed but, I do want to move into another exchange for what's becoming the obvious reasons. Any suggestions on what would be suitable, thanks.

If this cycle continues to repeat itself like this than imagine what it would look like after the 10th time.

How about instead of worrying about what someone else thinks about their own crypto portfolio. You possibly help them with whatever they are trying to figure out? This is not financial advice.

What's cashing out? Been hodling since August 2017.

I was wondering about this yesterday. Watching my portfolio climb almost all day made me feel great. Just because we might have been losing our hard earned money doesn't mean we need to be shitty towards each other. Optimism is the key in a slippery slope we all play into.
