This is to circumvent sanctions and bring some relief to the hurting oligarchs...it’ll cement the popular notion that cryptos are dangerous rather than what most users on this sub hope for - acceptance. 
But it will likely see BTC prices soar in the short term. A huge inflow of Russian money incoming.

The parenthesis you put in the middle of your introduction sentence explains exactly what the problem is...

Are you talking about using seedinvest or similar that structures the investment? Because a random small business collecting 100 random and ill-informed investors will not simply elect a board member...even franchises with established protocols often turn to chaos.

Being objective, what was the great news to justify the massive $20k?
What we’re seeing now is investors being wary of the market overall, 8 years into a beautiful bull run and now everyone’s starting to worry. The Fed is showing signs it’ll increase rates again, inflation seems to be growing again (see unexpected increase in wages), unemployment is at full load right now so can’t improve from where we are, and stocks are already valued 29x earnings...so probably not much more room to go there either.

I’d give it until the oscars, then the new memes will displace the old and the earth will keep spinning.

What an odd comment, what value do you think that adds? Why not respond in a rational and informed way letting everyone know why you disagree? 
I mean I like motor boats as much as the next guy but come on...

Millennials are often portrayed as being irresponsible with their money or being lazy bums...
But the stereotype really took hold after 2008 when the finically crisis caused unemployment across the board to shoot up, and as a result companies were less eager to hire new talent and focused more on experienced hires (entry levels require insane qualifications...this is so companies get gold talent and pay lower wages). 
And being irresponsible with money because they buy higher quality items/food, but this is a factor of being an informed consumer. Millennial a will research and shop around for the best price, older generations would simply take a coupon out of the mail and go to a store thinking it was being smart. 
Millennials are also portrayed as bums living with their parents, but this again is because wages are low and housing costs the most it’s ever cost. Older generations could save up for 2-3 years working on the factory line and get a decent house, now millennial are pouring 40-50% of their salaries into crappy apartment rents and saving barely anything. 
I also don’t think millennials are the social media freaks, more the generation that is currently under 15...those kids are always on YouTube or some other app obsessed with the next vine star or another. 
All in all, millennials are adjusting to a new economy - lower population growth, lower wages, higher cost of living, and millennials like an increased standard of living too. The cookie cutter suburban life doesn’t seem like it’ll last another 50 years.

North Korea is already using cryptos to essentially stay alive, they’re also a huge source of crypto piracy. It’s the perfect currency to steal and very easy for state operators to manipulate...
China benefits greatly from keeping its currency low hedges against the USD, it promotes exports and keeps their labor competitive. If Chinese yuan and USD were 1 to 1 you’d see manufacturing shift to other nations more rapidly. Many wealthy Chinese are also living well with the USD as high as it is, they own companies and properties abroad that generate income in USD and the exchange rate is so favorable that they every $1 they make abroad is 6.33 yuan to spend at home. 
The USD being a global currency brings stability and ease of business to emerging markets, and it allows them to manipulate the markets to boost their GDP.

I don’t disagree that millennials are all over social media, I’m just saying millennials use it differently than older gens or the younger gen. 
It’s not a source of information for millennials as much as it is for older gens, and it’s not a place to stalk random z list celebrities like it is for the 14 year olds. Millennials share their own experiences on instagram, Snapchat, Twitter....

This means that startup now has at least 100 shareholders to please and worry about...and if there are voting rights involved or similar then the startup is doomed to fail. 
Startups don’t need/can’t support too many investors. They need a few that are either extremely skilled and capable of enhancing the business *or* very wealthy and hands off. No room for 100 average joes that pooled their precious money together to get rich quick and worry all the way to the top. 
Investing in companies (and really we’re talking about building portfolios) should be done only if the investor is very wealthy. Otherwise investors should stick to the markets or real estate if they e get a little extra to play with.
