People will start exchanging for privatized coins like dash, monero, and zcash.

Some will get tripped up. Some will create fake websites that they funnel the coin into and pay it back to themselves directly and issue 1099s.
Lots of options. I mine litecoin directly, and cash it out monthly all at once. Screw day trading. I'll hodl till the profits are high enough, then cash out what I have. Easy to keep track of 12 transactions /year.

It's a direct result of 3 coinciding circumstances. The Chinese new year, timing of the first futures markets month ending, and the cancelation of the bitpay cards in the European areas. 4th possible influence is the Chinese miners pulling profits out to pay for their relocation

If you can't tell where it came from, it works.

Overall there will be less exchanges, at least for us hodlers. More care will be taken when exchanging for cashout. Big coins&gt;monero/dash/zec&gt;Ltc/eth/bch&gt;fiat

I've seen many complaints about debit cards. Bank transfers might be the workaround.  Still, if it's my money, no one should stop me from spending it on bitcoin. I understand credit cards are unsecured loans, and I get not issuing credit. It's private funds that has me hacked off.

Many are. Many people can't because their banks are colluding to prevent investment in cryptocurrency.

Good for you. My transaction at German American was still reversed.  It's not about proving someone wrong. It's just me pissed and warning you all it can happen.

Nope. They're even denying debit card purchases now.

It's what I was told by the branch manager. Might be an isolated case.

That's what happened to me.  It reversed the bitcoin purchase I made last week.  I was told they "want nothing to do with that bitcoin thing"
