This "feature" of these exchanges is likely keeping the price artificially inflated, it's super easy to dump money in and there are tons of hurdles on the way out, these range from the sell limit to all of sudden not being "verified"
Just go [here]( and search for any exchange, its a total scam space.

Make sure you clear this up, I did something similar when I was young and then closed the account with a negative balance.
The bank reported me to CHEX systems and I could not open a bank account anywhere for 5 years.
It suuuuuccked.

serious question, are you worried that "ransonware" and things like the Hollywood hacks may lead to some major governments banning the use of bitcoin?
lol @ downvotes for asking a serious, yet uncomfortable question.

Who knows...   
My dad bought gold all through the 90s thinking it was "too cheap" and would pop "any day now" he ended up having financial problems and was forced to sell it all before the price ever recovered, he lost a shit load to inflation.

The coming CME futures market will push the price of BTC down, just like they do to gold and silver. When that happens I'll be looking forward to the conspiracy riddled posts you usually see on the goldbug forums.
