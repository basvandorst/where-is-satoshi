Use square to pay yourself through credit card.  Money goes to your bank next day. Buy using bank account Or you trying to stay anonymous then that method don't help much

Anyone want to trade my paycoin for some btc?

Just like keeping bitcoin in an online wallet,  if you don't hold the gold personally you don't really own the gold.

I will report back when I get my card

I like Pbmining. Haven't had issues. But they seem too good to be true.  I also think genesis-mining is the real deal.  They go to conferences and show youtube videos of their farms. Key thing is to spread out to many cloud services.  Don't put your eggs all in one basket.

Look at the transaction on blockchain.  There is usually a spam message attached. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:23:32
Yup so they can scam people on btcjam. You can link your bitcointalk account to help your credit rating there which is probably what they want so they can look reliable.
@_date: 2014-08-10 20:59:54
Pics or it didn't happen :P
@_date: 2014-08-02 04:04:24
So do they charge your credit card for each purchase? I wanted to confirm my card but don't want to pay using my credit card. I hate waiting 4 days

Create a rushwallet.com bitcoin wallet. Turn the url into a qrcode. Make a nice card with the qrcode to their rushwallet.com account. I never done it but an idea I'm working on in my head.

Http://Shapeshift.io I use them. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 13:01:01
No. He's saying there is a way they can change the wallet address when you copy paste. So for instance if you were going to send money to a specific address it might change it when you paste and then you unknowingly send the btc to an unwanted scammers address.
@_date: 2014-12-18 01:48:58
Just get a trezor. 
Edit: added link

Did they give you your money back?  Also how many transactions were you doing to get a red flag?
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:04:17
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:35:30
Maybe.  But i have a few cold storage wallets and I hate scanning qr codes for each one when I throw some btc into them. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 01:48:58
It wouldn't cost you anything to have the option.  I'd offer it as an option even if only 1 person uses it as a form of payment a month.

some shit went down Sunday morning when payouts didnt arrive. Everyone assumed he was on the run with the coins. He then got doxxed on bitcointalk. Funds finally showed up probably because he was scared. But now mining payouts are to a crawl.
He also posted one last note a few days ago on bitcointalk.
Here is his last note:
Unfortunately the extreme harassment and threats since the posting of a Facebook profile with friends/family information has lead to some horrible losses thanks to some very shady people with unreasonable demands.  This is an attempt to reach out and give customers what is left, even if it means liquidating personal assets to help.  I will start the process now of looking at customers on a case-by-case basis and doing what I can to help.  Any refunds in December will be aimed at those who have suffered "extreme" losses due to reduced payout.  I will begin to look at the remaining majority of accounts in January.
Questions may go unanswered for awhile, but that is because there is a lot of work to do.  Please be patient.  Unfortunately it will be impossible to make everyone happy but a very honest attempt will be made.
For those who are wondering, the owner is not laughing all the way to Mexico.  Losses have been substantial due to complete invasion of privacy and some very harsh blackmail that followed thereafter, involving thoughts of suicide over some matters, but there will be a strong attempt to make things right even if it is unsuccessful.

That's a cool idea! How did you print them and put the scratch stuff on the card? I'd like to make some 
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:15:26
Is  legit?  I got my beta invite last week. It uses visa as their processor. They wanted $20.00 for the card so I been hesitant. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:55:34

I think bitpay offers free bitcoin to fiat conversions and coinbase offers it to your first 1 million in sales.

@_date: 2014-07-29 13:33:11
Didnt see a paywall but heres a copy paste:
When the San Francisco-based Bitcoin startup Coinbase closed a $25 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz last December, it marked a coming of age for the digital currency. The price of a bitcoin had hit $1,000, and a fledgling industry that had long been populated with libertarian true-believers, a few committed techies and some adventurous investors had suddenly become mainstream in Silicon Valley.
Bitcoin’s price has since fallen back down to earth. (Monday it hovered around $575.) But venture capital firms’ desire to invest in companies that can build businesses around Bitcoin has not abated. Coinbase Statistics—part of the Bitcoin-focused media organization Coindesk, a Bitcoin startup in its own right—calculated that in 2012 investors put $2.1 million into Bitcoin businesses; in 2013 that jumped to $88 million. As of June 2014, the count had already exceeded last year’s total, hitting $113 million.

The best way is to check how much insurance they earned. I usually invest in users who have earned 50% insurance or more. If I see nothing worth investing I let my btc sit in the insurance pool and earn interest.
Also follow their closed Facebook group to keep up to date on what's happening
@_date: 2014-09-25 01:49:13
I took the plunge and paid for them to send my card. I will report back once it arrives.

The virtual currency bitcoin is getting a very real boost on Monday, with the opening of the first licensed U.S. exchange.
Coinbase Inc., a startup backed by $106 million from the New York Stock Exchange, banks and venture-capital firms, said its exchange will offer greater security for individuals and institutions to trade bitcoin and monitor real-time pricing of the cryptocurrency.
The exchange could bring needed legitimacy to the currency, which isn’t backed by a central government and is traded over virtual exchanges, primarily overseas. Coinbase said it has insurance, offering traders some assurance that their money won’t disappear.
Bitcoin enthusiasts have been buffeted by the collapse of Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox last year—taking with it around half a billion dollars of investors’ money—and a security breach earlier this month at Slovenia-based exchange Bitstamp. The value of a bitcoin itself, determined by trading on existing exchanges, has fallen to about $240, from a peak in late 2013 of more than $1,200.
“To have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with bitcoin: its extreme volatility,” said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke University finance professor who has studied cryptocurrencies. “Bitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this.”
Coinbase’s founders say they have been working for five months to win licenses from state financial regulators. They have regulatory approval in half of U.S. states, including large population centers like New York and California. For now, Coinbase can do business with account holders only in states where it has approval.
Coinbase will take a small percentage—likely less than 1%—of most transactions, said Fred Ehrsam, 26 years old, a co-founder. The exchange will initially be limited to users in the U.S., but Chief Executive Brian Armstrong, 32, said he plans to expand overseas.
Mr. Armstrong said he expected to attract both individuals and businesses looking to trade bitcoin. “Our goal is to become the world’s largest exchange,” he said.
Others are looking to open U.S.-based bitcoin exchanges, including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the twin brothers known for their early feuds with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg .
Financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have been scrutinizing bitcoin recently. Benjamin Lawsky , the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, is working on a so-called BitLicense for firms looking to offer digital-currency services in the state; Coinbase is operating under earlier regulations. Mr. Lawsky’s plan is seen as a template for legislation in other jurisdictions, and it may give outsiders more confidence in the currency.
Bitcoins are created using high-powered computers that “mine” for the currency by solving complex mathematical equations. They are exchanged digitally either for currency, or goods and services. Ownership and transactions are recorded, anonymously, in a so-called blockchain, which backers say reduces the risk of fraud.
Bitcoin grew to prominence in recent years in part because of the ease with which it can be transferred.
Coindesk, which tracks the price of bitcoins, says 82,000 businesses accept the currency, double that of a year earlier, including e-commerce site Overstock.com Inc. and Expedia Inc., as well as many small retailers. The value of all bitcoin is $3.2 billion, according to Coindesk’s price index.
The NYSE invested in Coinbase during a $75 million round of fundraising that closed this month. Other investors include USAA Bank, the venture arm of Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit and former Thomson Reuters Corp. CEO Tom Glocer. Venture backers include Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures.
The NYSE’s investment was intended in part to “keep an eye on bitcoin as it matures as a legitimate currency,” President Tom Farley said. “Any currency relies on its acceptance.” The Coinbase exchange “is an important step for the currency to become socially acceptable.”
Coinbase counts about 2.2 million consumer wallets and nearly 40,000 merchants that use its services. The company has about 75 employees and plans to operate in 30 countries by year-end, up from 19 today.

Don't buy notes. Everyone issuing notes mostly are selling off over due loans and non payers..
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:41:22
No. Btcjam is a lending site just like indiegogo or gofundme except the person asking for money has to payback the amount loaned plus interest. The borrower will put how much they want, what interest rate they want, and pay period (days, weeks, month.
Every lender will read the borrowers description and we all chip in whatever we want.  Once enough money is collected the borrower will take the btc and do the payments as described in their request.
If borrower fails to pay after 90 days btcjam will award you all their info they supplied. I.E: address, phone number, facebook, email,etc etc.
Most people will then put their notes up for sale at a cheap price in hopes that someone wanting to have enough to make it worth their while to go find and collect the defaulted loan.
When investing look at how much of their profile they completed. How many loans they currently have. And score.
Look at feedback, comments and so on.
Start by investing small amounts like .001 btc just to get the feel of it. Fund stuff that is close to 100%. Stay away from people who are new and asking for huge amounts. 
Instan payback Rep loans usually end badly. If it's a rep loan over .5btc stay away. A new scammer account will usually do small rep loans and gradually go higher until they then have your trust and then leave with the coins. 
Follow me  on btcjam and when ever I invest in someone you will see it in the newsfeed. There is a ton of good investors to follow. Usually if they are all investing in the same loan it's pretty good.
