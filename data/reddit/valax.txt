You get shat on for being poor.

I live in a country where I pay nothing. It's widely considered by non-Americans than the US healthcare system is barbaric. Even more of a joke when you consider that you spend more per capita than any other country on it.

So if the majority voted to lower interest rates massively so their mortgages were cheaper; leading to spiraling inflation and poor exchange rates (to name a few problems), that'd be ok?
It's called the tyranny of the majority for a reason. I'd rather have a functioning economy than let some uneducated/ignorant/manipulative fucks ruin everything for the sake of equality.

Having unelected experts instead of elected politicians is a *much better* decision.

That'd be even worse. The vast majority of people have no fucking clue of basic economics let alone monetary policy. Not to mention the potential for populism which rose up recently.

Plus hyperinflation at that time was caused by a swathe of issues both domestic and global.  It didn't fail just because it's fiat.

That's literally what inflation is. If the gold is worth less, then you can purchase less with it, thereby there is inflation.

Which country are you in then where it isn't working?

It's bizarre to me how Americans dislike universal healthcare so strongly when nearly every other country benefits massively from it. The brainwashing is real.

It's funny how you say "lefties" yet left wing people in the US are still more right wing than actual right wingers in most European countries. Although left/right wing labels are retarded and meaning nothing anyway.
Free healthcare isn't socialist, it's common sense. The US is just such a backwards country that it won't happen.

Well if you're Polish then I can understand why you'd hate communism. The toll it's had on the country was immeasurable. 
However, I imagine that faults in the Polish healthcare system are not down to the ominous concept of "socialism" but instead down to poor management and funding by the Polish government (And let's be fair, PiS are fucking delusional).
UK has issues due to lack of funding from a government that is attempting to privatise it. The problems are caused by the direct opposite to communism.
At the end of all that I still think communism is a fucking stupid system. I just strongly disagree with you that universal healthcare is communist.

Paxman's entire career has been built upon asking difficult questions and then trying to break down their arguments for the sake of understanding. There's a reason he's so well respected in British media.

No way you're Dutch and didn't know that North Holland and South Holland are provinces...
