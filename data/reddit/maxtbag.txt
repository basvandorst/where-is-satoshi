You really think that's it? Any reason or are you just a shill? 
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:02:54
1 btc is actually a crazy high amount if mass adoption were ever to occur. There will be &lt; 20 million btc in circulation after all are mined. Imagine a world of 7 billion fighting over \~18 million coins. I don't actually think that will ever happen, just making the point that 1 btc is no small amount.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:52:42
If people just stopped selling I'd be rich by now.
@_date: 2019-07-01 13:04:56
We probs going back below 10k. But yeah, nothing to be concerned about. The smart people offloaded some bags at the highs and now wait to buy back. Easy money.
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:34:18
Either that or it will be around 50k by then. Whatever play you make, you're taking a risk.

You're request that whales forgo profit now in order to help btc possibly hit another ath in the future isn't logical. Money now is always better than money later, especially if there is uncertainty involved with those future benefits. Besides, it's unlikely that whales that are truly aiming to manipulate price even care about the technology. They just see an opportunity to take candy from a baby. If btc goes to zero why would they care? They would have sold at the top. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 10:52:24
Are you having a stroke? Someone help this dude 
@_date: 2018-05-30 19:34:48
None of the real early adopters are still here in the reddit threads. They are laughing at all us fools freaking out every $100 dump. Although I've seen people here say they bought at &lt;$10 multiple times, but there's a &gt;99% chance they are lying. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:39:52
Well if you're playing with millions of dollars as part of a organised cabal to manipulate prices it's likely the people actually managing the funds are employed by the whales. Those people would be very good at what they do and would be on it very much full time. It's kind of difficult to make mistakes when you both know what your doing and can dictate the price in the first place. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 17:50:29
Is this $100 dump really all the fat cat overlords can muster? Wake me when something exciting happens. 
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:59:04
Wow, just checked price after a few months. Things not going great I see.
@_date: 2019-03-04 12:14:54
Welcome to the roller coaster. It may not always be a pleasant ride (in fact lately it is almost always unpleasant), but one way or another it will always have you saying "holy fuck" as you so eloquently put it.

Where all the smug shorters today? They gone quiet? No liquidity to fill their stops either LOL
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:13:15
This is just a whale dumping so he can buy back more at lower prices after all the sheep are done selling at the bottom. Which in fact concentrates btc further into the hands of the few, it doesn't spread it out. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 04:09:50
What are you basing this on? Do you have any evidence or data that anymore selling is impossible? Or are you just talking out your ass praying that your investment doesn't get reduced to nothing? Because im telling you right now if the right people wanted to we could go below 5 k today. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 06:27:33
Okay, well then by that logic for the price to ever increase the interest level needs to massively increase. As all new investors last year got burnt and there has been so much negative press the chance of interest massively increasing is pretty much 0. Which means the price can only go down long term, so we should all sell right now?
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:42:44
I'm still holding on bro, probably around break even on my investment or a bit in the red. Not planning on selling just yet because I agree with most of what you're saying. Though you didn't really address my main point. You say "If btc has another bullrun in 2022", assuming you want to wait for years while you investment tanks any bullrun in the future is going to require massive amounts of buying power and renewed interest from both Mum and Dad investors as well as institutional money. I just don't see another buying surge ever happening again, btc had it's moment last year and now it's lost the confidence of almost all regular investors (not blockchain fan boys). Truth is this is just too risky of a space for most people, and that ain't gonna change in 2022. I doubt btc will still be around by then. Blockchain sure, but btc and all these other shit coins? Very doubtful. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 04:16:15
BTC has no utility now and unless tech changes (i.e. quantum computing) it will remain useless for any large scale adoption. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 15:12:04
If you had the choice to convert all of your savings into gold or btc which would you choose? Any sane person would not choose btc to hedge against the dollar. Therefore, saying btc is the digital version of gold doesn't make a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2019-03-07 08:20:56
He's a redditor for one week acting like btc's hype man. It's an indication to sell. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 14:45:10
Well btc as a working global currency is fundamentally broken in it's current state. So it's a pretty good comparison actually 
@_date: 2018-10-12 18:12:00
I actually appreciate this nice and informative response. Though this interest scale seems like an arbitrary and course scale measure. Would be interested to learn how that is calculated because it sounds like nonsense. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 11:46:06

I question the value of your efforts here. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 08:38:10
Doubt we'll see any real changes until we actually hit the bottom. Need a big capitulation with the volume behind it, then we can start to work on changing the sentiment. All these little pumps are meaningless baits. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 06:41:29
Came here for the moon and "this is the bullrun" comments. Was not disappointed. 
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:27:15
Maybe whales, a lot of it is traders as well. Was pretty clear that this was the end of a 5th wave up, meaning a correction was imminent. Seeing as how pretty much everyone buying and selling is a trader these fast moves make a lot of sense. 
@_date: 2019-06-10 11:44:16
Whales sell at top and buy at bottom once people start panicking. Pretty standard.
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:01:12

Bullish sentiment.. stirring hype? What kool-aid are you drinking? We getting pushed around by fat cats over and over in a bear market that could last many years. Once people accept this it will be easier to endure. 
@_date: 2019-06-10 10:27:58
HODL depends on your position. If you bought in at 2k or less then this means very little to you so you may as well just hold it long term. If you bought at 20k and you listened to people saying HODL all the way down then you may have a mental disability. It's pretty much something people say to trick people into not selling when they probably should. Not saying that now is a good time to sell, because it probably isn't.
@_date: 2019-02-24 15:25:12
Not sure how you could have done that seeing as how the price was about 4k a few days ago. 
@_date: 2019-12-17 14:07:09
Gonna be one of those days

@_date: 2018-11-25 20:10:51
To be honest a recovery to ath is pretty much impossible. Over the next few months after we bottom we might see some price increases as the last of the bulls take their shot. But the dreams of btc are gone and have been for awhile. Now is just the time people start realising it. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:46:04

They are both shitcoins in that they are completely useless for any practical purpose. Still some great projects out there that *might* exist in the future. But even they are still probably over-valued right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:06:22
It is risky, holding is risky to. Remember people were saying "it's too risky to sell, wait for it to come back" when the price was 11k. The people who sold are laughing now.

@_date: 2018-11-27 18:26:20
Welcome back dude, it's rough out there no doubt. At this stage I'd say hold what you got and pray. Buying more is pretty much a bet that we're going to rally out of this, I'm not sure anyone with half a brain really believes that. But selling now is more of a risk then just holding imo. If you don't need the money who cares, sh*t comes and goes.

@_date: 2018-11-20 17:15:02
Sure, blockchain isn't going anywhere. That will be bitcoins legacy. But this is r/bitcoin, not r/blockchain (is there even a thing?). BTC is useless as a currency, useless a store of value, it's not scalable and it never was. Ya'll talk about 'fundamentals', if you knew the meaning of the word you should know it was fundamentally flawed from the start. The guy above is right and you all know it. Was great to make a buck, still is and will be again most likely. But if you all imagined this experiment bringing down banks and fiat currency, then I don't know what to tell you. You were wrong. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:06:27
Just think about it for one second before you get all salty and downvote. Btc had one shot to engage the global public, society has a short attention span. It failed, the people who came in got burned and everyone else laughed. To return to new ath's there would need to be massive wave of new buyers, much bigger than anything you saw in any of the rallys in btc's history. That's not going to happen, therefore, we will never see 20k again. You probably know this already, you seem like a shill trying to trick people into hodling. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:47:38

Hey man I agree, pity there wasn't more people saying it when people were dumping all their money into btc last year. Yes it will never go to zero, there will always be people willing to buy every last coin for $1. So there's that at least. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:49:49

@_date: 2018-11-19 11:46:44
Well in the short term it's going lower, that's almost certain. At which point there will be an option to re-enter with more btc if one chooses. HODLing has always been a stupid strategy for stupid people. I know because I was one of them. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:26:56
Just because they can buy back in doesn't mean anyone wants to.

Yet again you refer to 2014 as an example to apply to now. You really can't do that. And yes it's everyones choice to leave at a loss or not. It really isn't a bad decision though. Risky to do now though If you've held down to this point. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:54:04
Depends on where on the Earth's surface you're standing. If I want to go to the moon on the other side of the Earth I'd first have to travel through the Earth's core to get there. That's a good analogy for price of btc right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 13:57:24
I think you're over-generalising, a lot of people would have spare money to buy back in if they wished. What you're suggesting is worst case for them. Even so, I bet if you asked such people whether they would have rather sold at 11k (at a loss) compared to 5.2k (at a devastating loss) they would be glad they sold at 11k. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:48:22
It must be really awkward for you right now posting with the reddit ID "MOON_BOY". 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:56:19
Yes yes, yet another person who "bought at $5" or something. If you believe everyone that's like 50% of people posting here. You know how I know that you didn't buy low and get rich? Those people are long gone from this sub-reddit. I suppose you could have bought low and held this whole time. In which case you're still up sure. But you've thrown away a fortune at this point and that money is gone forever. Which would also explain why you're still here being salty. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:57:18

Yea and I find every one of his tweets hilarious. He's not ruining my country.
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:21:09
I entered last year when price was around 5-6k. Which would have been fine if I had just held btc. Figured it was smart to diversify into alts as well, unfortunately I did that when alts were at their highs and held them for far too long on the way down. Got fed up and sold during dump the other day at about 5700 at a sizable loss. There's my honest story, still watching closely but so far I'm happy with the decision. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 16:41:42
He is saying bitcoin will always recover because people like to buy low and sell high and all crashes are alike. This implies that no matter what happens or when the price crashes it will always recover and surpass previous highs. I might exraggerate to point out that this argument is crazy but that was essentially his point. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:23:07
Naive? No. Having a laugh at all the scared kiddies out there? Yes. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:49:19
Thats what people need to understand. There are a small group controlling every turn of the market now that new buyers have dried up. It's not in their interest to let it get anywhere near ath. All they want is for it to yoyo around, as market confidence falls the highs will be lower and the lows will be lower. We're already seeing that. Stay safe out there kids. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 16:09:16
The situation is far different from 3-4 years ago, like I said most people hadn't even heard of bitcoin back then. By your logic bitcoin will go through these cycles reaching new ATHs for an infinite period of time until 1 btc is worth more money than even exists. It's going to be a sad day for us all when you finally realise I was right. Remember this conversation. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:28:52
So according to this as long as someone is willing to pay $0.000001 for 1 btc even if there are no blocks being mined it's not dead. Makes sense. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:09:00
Well the market is not the same as in 2015, back then it was still a mystery to most people with little worldwide exposure. So there remained huge potential for hype generation, which occurred in 2017 and resulted in the bubble we all rode up. The market is mature now and another hype wave is far less likely. If you were a Mum/Dad investor or a finance manager would you really be buying into btc after watching this crash knowing it has literally no use case and is driven by pure speculation or would you put it somewhere safer? Instead of calling me uninformed and under-read because I doubt another ATH is possible maybe you should try to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results and actually think about the situation rather than just crossing your fingers. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:28:26
Yeah keep converting real money to fake money. Was going to compare it to monopoly money, but at least you can hold that and it's made of paper. Good luck!

Exaggerating bro. Relax, have some fun. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:56:37
I sure hope you're right and that your extended time in the space hasn't blinded you to how an everyday person looks at it. I've been in it for 2 years and setting up wallets, tansferring money etc is far too complicated. Try telling a 50 year old about wallet security and that no one guarentees their value if you make a single mistake. It's unusable in it's current form so this dev team has an unspeakable amount of work ahead of them. They need exposure and names people trust to market this to the common person. So much needs to happen, we're looking at a 10 year timeline. So much can happen in that time, I just don't think btc will survive. As for price, I think we're going a whole lot lower. 1k, maybe less. Then the only news people will see if how btc is a failed experiment. It's hard to come back from that. I want to believe though, so let's wait and see. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:01:54

Dude I've been asking myself the same question. I've been considering selling out my initial investment while I'm still in profit, but it's a fair chunk of my stack right now. Only thing stopping me is as soon as I do it will likely hit 15 or 16k in a few months... but could also be 2k. Best of luck with your trading, gotta play the whales game if you wanna win
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:24:38
Dude I'm not saying it can't happen, whether I'm wrong or not my points are valid. In it's current form btc has no use case: fact, the world watched the price crash and now btc is little more than a meme to most people: fact, price fluctuation is currently determined only by whale manipulation and day traders: fact. It is not in a good place right now, please tell me a situation where the price goes to a ATH? Do not say the failure of banks and the financial system. If you disregard my points as fantasy then I am not the one kidding myself. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:34:05
What's even your point here? Is this like a "haha I made money and you guys lost money"? That's some low IQ sh*t right there lol
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:27:30
Okay, so the people saying hold are right and people saying sell are fud spreading trolls that need to be instantly reported. I dumped every last coin at 5.6k and suggested others do the same. But yeah, hodling was the right call, guess I messed up! Point is just because someone has a different opinion doesn't mean that they have no place in this sub and need to be silenced. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:57:45
What you've said here is correct, and is plausible, though still unlikely. My scenario is also plausible and I'm primarily looking for you to admit that it is possible. We both know btc lacks a use case, even if it could be scaled up and simplified to actually work as a worldwide transaction system it faces the challenge that people won't shift from a current system that works, that they understand and is supported by the powers that be. It used to function as a way to conduct illicit transactions, now it's just a trading playground for whales and speculators. It has never functioned in the way that it was intended and there's a high chance it never will. Maybe in the future we will all be using block chain tech in our everyday lives, but that future sure as hell won't involve bitcoin. Just land with me in reality for a moment, no one but us is reading this. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:09:46

That's not good advice haha, come back in 6 months btc could be &lt; 1k. The reason everyone gets so freaked out at every drop is because they know anything could happen. That's what makes the space so exciting.. and also scary 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:14:28
Ah, the best comeback to when someone calls you out on r/bitcoin. "I bought at $13, so suck it!". I guarantee 99% of those people bought at $15 k + and now are considered the possibility they will never get their investment back. Suck it! 
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:31:30
Not nearly enough volume for this to be a bottom. I'd be looking for a hard bounce with at least as much buying volume as we had selling volume. Until I see that I'm skeptical. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:57:33
Yes thank you, that was my plan. I held from 20k to 6k, just picked the wrong moment to sell. I'm still around 300% up so who really cares. It's just money.
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:45:23
Don't worry, I got washed as well. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:24:59
Because some people lack sensible financial planning. We need this crash to shake out those people. They can re-buy later &gt; $10k :) 
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:23:34
Your own logic and gut instinct is worth far more than whatever these trolls will say.  
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:37:28
Sigh, sold off a lot at 6.8k and just bought back in with a big loss. What can ya do? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:33:14
8k is a far away dream at this stage. Any rally is just an excuse to spark another round of selling. Probably don't sell.... but expect things to get worse before they get better. Then you won't be disappointed 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:26:58
I've been selling little bits on the way down and cashed out my initial investment months ago. It's all gravy for me bud, appreciate your concern though ;)

Yeah that's complete nonsense. Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:35:31

@_date: 2018-11-27 18:48:58
Well don't go into anything other than fiat that's for sure. But as I said, if you're okay with that value going to zero just sit tight. You'll hate yourself if/when a bounce occurs and you sold for pennies. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:50:48
Hi, Australian here. Can confirm I see bitcoin on the horizon. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:28:00
That's something a child would say so I'm going to go ahead and guess I'm spot on with this assumption. Good luck with your investment. Don't lose your parents too much money ;) 
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:06:21
Not dead, but no faith in the market = no new buyers. From here on out it's going to be constant manipulation to trick you into losing your money with a gradual decline. Not trolling, literally what I think and so far it's proving true. Still hodling though. Am I an idiot? Maybe. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:45:52
Too late, I'm writing from the nursing home. Docs given me a month to live. My children haven't visited me in 30 years. Such is life. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:37:36
You are assuming nothing has changed in the market. Things are totally different now and if you really think this crash and previous crashes are the same you are delusional. Really amazes me how naive you guys can be, defying logic to suit your beliefs.

@_date: 2018-02-05 14:05:01
People were saying that about 8k and it went through it like butter. Get a grip mate, if people are pulling their buy orders because of the bad sentiment then the idea of a 'support' level is pretty much meaningless 
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:53:00
haha, Do the big boy thing and hodl? My god you are brain dead. Or just trolling these poor folk. The big boy thing was to sell awhile back. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 12:37:37
I can guarantee a lot of everyday investors look at the price volatility and crashes and care a great deal. Sure, traders and people with big money love to buy low and sell high. But you do need to understand that for another ATH to be possible we're going to need new buyers that far exceed what we saw in 2017 as many investors will be selling as soon as they hit break even. How do you not understand this? As far as I see my point makes sense while essentially all you are saying is it will recover because people like to "buy low sell high". That is incredibly naive and doesn't make any sense.  
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:34:04

Hi no coiner. Not really sure what you're talking about, but thought I'd correct you anyway. Unless you have something like Kallmans syndrome pretty much every male has similar levels of testosterone. It's how your body converts those hormones into other metabolites that actually results in a phenotypic response, which is done by way of protiens called enzymes. Good day. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:07:04
It does affect me? I'm losing profit by the day. I just don't come to reddit to cry about it like the rest of you. Grow up. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:40:50
That makes no sense at all.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:36:48
That's complete bs man, the only way the have your seed is if they opened it, configured it and re-sealed it. And you would know because when you went to configure it yourself you wouldn't get a seed. So to say every re-seller has your seed is a plain lie. 
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:44:17
Not manipulated? If you understood markets and the extremely low volume of btc trading compared to stocks you would understand that there's no way it's not being being manipulated. History teaches us that if there is an opportunity for the very wealthy to exploit a situation to increase their wealth then that exploitation will occur. Hell, even the stock market was subject to manipulation before it became illegal. You think no one colludes to do the same to crypto where it's 100% legal? Wake up people. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:41:34
You have no idea what you're talking about. China don't plan to be left behind on blockchain technology. They are just doing it in their own way to protect their citizens from scams and to prevent large amounts of money leaving the country. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:43:28
This made me laugh. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 23:08:03
Nope, bear market. Sure, it was at $2000 a year ago. That's irrelevant. Most people bought &gt; 10 k anyway and the price this time next year could be $1000. Thanks for the optimisim, but lets live in the real world
 
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:24:26
I'm sure you're smart enough not to actually listen to anyone's advice here. Which makes me wonder, why even ask the question? 
@_date: 2018-07-11 00:03:07

@_date: 2018-07-27 02:05:48
If that was your plan you should have done it a few hours ago. Now it's a risk.

The december run up was legitimate buying. This bear market however is the perfect situation to take everyones money
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:50:52
Yeah, hectic. Sucks being 103 years old. Had a good run though I reckon. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:07:50
Reality is that every move up or down is manipulation. Can you imagine the price and volume in these markets if there wasn't people propping it up? My estimate is btc would be down around 2-3k by now 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:21:17
All the people with open shorts are quiet all of a sudden? Interesting. (I should say *had* open shorts). Rekt. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 08:40:17
A smart investor places their capital in both, with a spread that depends on the level of risk you want to take on. But you're not smart, are you Doc? 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:24:41
Why would anyone use btc for large expenditures now when the price is in the dumps? That's no different from selling it into fiat at a loss and using fiat for things. Using btc for transactions will remain pointless with this volatility anyway, who wants to accept something in their business that could be worth 0 in a years time? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:57:37
Thanks, appreciate. Always helpful to see other people's charts. I tend not to trade much anyway as I will clearly get the wrong idea the majority of the time 
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:22:40
You're considering selling at the start of what *might* be a market reversal? I know we need to go a bit further and hold these prices for any kind of confirmation but that's still ballsy. Good luck sir is all I can say. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:14:43
Ya'll get so caught up in the ups and downs. It goes up a bit and everyone thinks it has to keep going up. Goes down a bit everyone comes on here like it's the end of the world. In the words of a great Australian hero, just fkn relax aye 
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:01:34
To all of you saying these massive dumps that occur within a few minutes are normal market movements, you are wrong. Unless you consider market wide manipulation by groups with deep pockets to be 'normal'. This would be illegal in almost every other market. The same people probably flick through these threads laughing at everyone's stupidity and how easy it is for them to make money.

Could well be. I was thinking of Trent from the Punchy massif
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:12:18
Well I'm not a trader, so I could be wrong. In which case the market is now totally dominated by short term traders (also a bad sign). Though history tells us if there's on opportunity somewhere for exploitation and there are people with the means to do it then it's almost certainly being done. Surely you can't disagree with that? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:06:39
Maybe you can explain to me what people mean when they say that. Say you already had a lot of money invested and your plan was to buy the dips down from 20k. Doesn't that mean you're endlessly pumping more and more fiat into this bear market with no idea where the bottom is? Seems to me that's just creating more risk for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 06:35:53
Don't worry, you'll see 6k soon enough. Probably today. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:45:07
Fair enough. I'm more speaking to the people who come on here announcing their short positions and troll holders every time btc dumps. No doubt a lot of people just got burned

Loser? Hmm. That's odd. I kinda feel like a winner right now.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:52:18
Remember when people here were buying above 8k and I said just wait for a pullback then everyone downvoted saying it probably won't pullback and 8k is a good buy in point. I swear it's the same shit over and over in this sub, which is what keeps me coming back. It's hilarious.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:18:26
This did not age well.
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:19:36
Beyond being an asset of questionable value in an overall bear market, it broke down out of the price channel so the traders dumped.
EDIT: Or was the whole thing just a big bear flag? I dunno, not into TA. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:02:51
Watch out guys, we've got an expert over here! Pretty much guaranteeing these prices are a bargain! Wow, you must have 100% of your capital in btc right now since you are so sure? Should I be taking out credit for these guaranteed bargain prices?  
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:30:16
uh oh, I think the 3 week redditor just bought the top ;)
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:11:31
Battle for sure, impressive volume coming in. If I bought on this last rally I'd be a little worried though. Think we'll work higher eventually but it might take a few attempts.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:58:13
Hey redditor for 1 month, sadly my mother tells me this everyday. That's why I come onto r/bitcoin to gain strength from all the dreams that are dying here. Including yours! Mmmm, so sweet! 
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:21:35
You are right. Most ppl here have lost money and know nothing. Doesn't mean it isn't fun! Only brain dead people actually take advice from here so relax a little.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:03:11
Apologies, I'll look at this in a moment. I'm pleasuring myself. Little difficult to see past the fat though :D
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:52:32
Looking forward to it. It is of course possible that a capitulation event never occurs and we bump around this support for a month or more before climbing. If everyone is thinking something will happen it usually means that thing is prevented from occuring. I think btc is a dead and failed project, but the big cheeses will make it run at least once more. How do I know this? Because they want to make more money off of the idiots that populate this world. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:21:50
See you then, I'm almost certainly right but if I'm wrong and btc replaces the dollar (not gonna happen) then I'll be as happy as you. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:56:50
You actually listened to the HODL shills? That was only ever a stupid strategy for stupid people perpetuated to try and trick people into not selling. Guess it worked. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 14:43:17
So in your world btc is a hot women that's recently been the victim of an acid attack? While BCHSV is starting to grow some nice looking breasts. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:16:57
Yeah, and each time the advice is better and better. The people who bought in at 20k probably thought they were pretty smart to. People who bought and held at 10k got rekt. Not saying you won't make money if you buy here, but someone needs to balance out the hype. This type of thinking is what got everyone in trouble in the first place.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:12:20
I like your way of thinking. But c'mon, if OP thinks the price won't go below 8k ever again he must be new. I mean, he's already down if he bought in when he said he did lol.
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:05:42
So... who fell for the bull trap? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:23:55
Ah finally, someone who understands bitcoins only real value. It's network of users. So yes, while it's network remains strong it will have some value as long as we continue to say it does and enough people care. However, as it's fundamentally flawed in that it is not scalable, not economical to run and is just flat out unnecessary and over complicated the bitcoin dream will die in time. As it's users diminish, so to will it's value. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:26:38

@_date: 2019-05-09 10:32:58
Key words here are "assuming" and "probably". I wouldn't say a new ATH is probable. Though, it certainly isn't impossible.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:27:54
How's that going so far? Also doesn't change the fact it's over-complicated and completely unnecessary, trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist will not end well. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:50:22
Thing is the 'masses' don't care. Thanks for the DV, but deep down you know I'm right.
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:02:49
yeah... bitcoin drops from 20k to 3.5k in a year long bear market, but somehow a $200 pump means it's all over. We got our lambos back lads because this guy on reddit says so! Use your brain please. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 13:22:44
Think about it. If a 4x investment was as probable as you say then every smart investor on the planet would be scrambling to invest the majority of their capital in this asset. I'd venture to say that if we don't hit another ATH in the next 5 years then it won't happen. A 4x return over 5 years is pretty damn good. So either it's not that probable and remains highly speculative or you alone know something the rest of the world does not and should invest everything you have in btc.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:49:34
Did you seriously just compare the real world application of bitcoin to airplanes and the computer? 
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:59:23
"It seems most believe", who is most? The people here? Have you conducted interviews with 'most' analysts and people who hold large amounts of digital currency? I'm just curious where you are getting these ideas. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:22:56
I too am dead inside. Once you've faced the reality of your investment going to zero there is really nothing that can faze you.
@_date: 2018-12-06 03:38:22
Nah, what about the market cycles, institutional moneyz and da sick fundamentals. This is good for bitcoin bro. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:25:30
Nah, just common sense bud. Cheers for your intelligent addition to the discourse though! 
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:21:24
Yes, the stupidity is what makes it so easy for the smart money to play people for fools. I mean, it's fine to not have knowledge. But just the fact you get attacked for trying to inject some sensibility into the community. Not that it takes a genius to know that you shouldn't be opening new positions at the top of a parabolic pump.
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:17:15
Guys relax, it's just a few people needing to buy christmas presents :D 
@_date: 2018-12-03 15:04:21
That sell off to 3900 took about 20 seconds lol 
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:10:34
Why would your target buy be just under the level of strong support we're at? That makes no sense. If we break 3200 we are definitely going lower than 3000. Much lower.  
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:01:32
You may regret that move. I sold some at 6800 thinking the same thing and I'm already kicking myself.
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:40:20
You guys cling onto terms like "institutional money" and "fundamentals" like they are some magic buzzwords that are going to rocket us back to 20k. I'm still invested in the space and I'm prepared to lose that money. But realistically we aren't seeing those prices again, the world has moved on. How do people not see that? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 07:48:26
Where is the dude here yesterday that was saying "I hope you bought sub 4k because that was your last chance"? I think what he meant to say was I hope your selling above 4k, because this is going to be your last chance. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:12:16
I mean, I was being sarcastic. OP is the stupidest thing I've ever read. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:21:57
Yes, these movements are totally natural and organic. Nothing odd going on here at all /s
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:42:25
Wow, reading people panic in here is kinda surprising. Unless you only been in the space for a few months you must have seen this pullback coming. I'm amazed it hasn't dropped back further, which it most likely will over the coming days. Just relax. The road to 10k isn't going to be vertical.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:41:05
I dunno what to say man, if you really think that the run to $200 in 2013 and the run to $20k late last year are the same thing and that the overall market and prospects remain unchanged then nothing I say will make you think different. I understand some people need to believe that though. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:18:24
Well I don't subscribe to the deluded notion that bitcoin will replace fiat and bring down the banks, I mean you'd have to be brain dead if you ever thought that was going to occur. It really has no use case, which I knew from the start, but I wanted to make a buck. I like many others were complacent and didn't see us going this deep into the red, so ended up selling too late. Now we are trying to look for opportunities to break even, and believe me, as soon as people have an opportunity to get out with their investment they are going to do it. Which is another reason why a new ATH is essentially impossible. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 19:34:23
Yeah, just a casual holiday sell off. This is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:27:51
What's that old saying? "If it ain't broke don't fix it!". Good luck with your investment though, I'm sure it will change the future..

Can you stop shilling your own channel here every single day? Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 10:03:06
Just curious. Considering how it will never be used as a day to day currency and has no use as a store of value; what do you think it's use case is exactly and why should someone pay thousands of dollars to own a bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:40:52
That doesn't make sense. It can only be exchanged for goods because we say it has a non-zero value, so your argument is circular. Technically I 'could' exchange a rock for any amount of goods or services if everyone decided it had a non-zero value. Probably unfair to compare a rock to bitcoin though, at least I can use the rock as a paper weight. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:14:24
Truth. Never get tired of seeing 10 btc orders flying about. Makes me feel poor.
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:27:30
Doesn't really matter, just have a target in mind and commit. Even if I was to buy back in right now and it kept going down I'd be far better off than if I'd just continued to hodl. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 08:56:28
Easy, wait for the big boys to take us on another run when they decide they want to make some more money after shorting the market for months. Then use that final opportunity to get out with some dignity before this experiment finally dies. Either that or get out now if you believe it's already dead, it's really a judgement call. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:14:25
We are going to drop 95% and it will be good for bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:53:51
Okay, a few things here. Firstly, it is you who is acting like a child and has so easily fallen into my web. Just listen to you, it's pathetic that you're getting angry on a pointless reddit thread. No one here knows anything, if you come here for serious advice or tips you must have some sort of disability, for real. Next thing, if you have that much skin in the game and are getting this emotional over a tiny pullback then I fear for your investment, truly. Also you seem to think having is spelled as *haveing*, my 6 yo niece would not make that error. Which brings me back to the disability thing. Good luck, seems like you'll need it.
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:50:37
Aren't you the same dude who was calling an end to the bear market the other day?

You're probably right. Which is why I'm still on the sidelines with my buy orders ready. Sub 1k is a bit too optimistic though, I doubt we'll see that. Bit too low even for me to want to see.

Would you like a medal? Get down off that soap box before you hurt yourself. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:57:17
Don't wanna rain on the parade but entering right now is crazy. At least wait for a pullback....
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:14:07
Fair enough. I mean, I dumped everything weeks ago so I kind of like my strategy better. But each to ones own. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 05:13:33
Did you seriously try to engage with that troll? You know what they say about idiots, argue with them and they'll drag you down to their level and beat you with experience. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:56:58
Well you could sell now, wait for it to hit 1k and more than triple your position. Though hodlers such as yourself are too smart for such things.

Right, maybe we should just be asking you? Sit back and relax, go ahead and DCA all the way down to $1 btc :-) 
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:54:27
Well if they are able to dump the coins on the market and crash the price it kinda is your problem. Not that they will do that. They will probably just use it as leverage and manipulate price to make even more.

Oh good, because that guy seemed like someone stupid enough to literally buy into his own bs :D 
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:05:09
Bitcoin is confusing. Some days the smallest FUD happens and it sends the price into a death spiral. Then binance gets taken for 7k btc which should worry everyone and the price goes parabolic. Don't get me wrong I ain't complaining. Just doesn't feel right.

Ah let me guess, your one of the guys who believe in the market cycles and that this bear market is good for bitcoin. Everything is different now, before last year the world hadn't caught on. Now they have and everyone watched it crash, they general public won't be fooled again. I hope I'm wrong though. 
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:09:02
Well it's coming back a bit now. Would appreciate a 6500 retrace so I can jump back in as well.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:41:53
Actually that has nothing to do with it. Your unreasonable anger just tells me the mistake you made. DW, I'm sure we'll take another run at it in a few months champ.
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:15:02
Nah, another leg up incoming.
@_date: 2019-05-14 11:50:29
Agreed dude, who fucking knows. Certainly not me. But the 'smart' money isn't buying up here. Put it that way.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:40:17
Stop shilling your channel. No ones cares.
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:10:23
Well there are only so many rocks on earth... just kidding. Seriously though, by your logic if I start my own shitcoin with the structure you describe it instantly becomes worth something and I will have solved the mystery of creating perpetual wealth. Everyone will want my shitcoin, whether it has a function or serves any purpose is according to you, irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 06:41:54
Because people sell then come here to encourage more panic selling
