Has anyone recovered his coins with his help?

I just woke up with my BCH back in my wallet, bitmain mined the transaction and put a 4.97 tx. I had sent to bitcoin segwit address 4.97 and they sent me 4.97 back :) They're great!
People stop paying this guy! CONTACT BTC.COM! They will solve the problem. I contacted them trough support ticket.

I contacted them but they replied by just saying that their updated their wallet, it supports both BTC and BCH, and that I should not send BCH to BTC :)
I copy pasted the BTC address from BTC.COM wallet and pasted it on the exchange, and they sent me BCH to that address. After that transaction, the BTC address disappeared, a new one was generated as it was used....

I see them being stuck in the segwit address on blockchair, they haven't been moved

Yes, I did receive and sent bch on an other address.
I just checked the segwit BCH address I sent the money by mistake, and the money are still THERE! So, this guy is a scam! Don't send him anything. Also, he's using a new reddit account and a mail2tor email....He wants to steal our recovery info and then use it when there will be a real recovering service. DON'T SEND HIM ANYTHING!

How do we know this is not a scam? The address I sent BCH to is not in the list you posted.
