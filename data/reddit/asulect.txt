Install Jaxx for windows and put in your 12 word seed to see if you can see the coins.  If it's there, you are done.  You can send your coins to another wallet.
Also, you can try the same 12 word seeds on a different wallet like Coinomi.
Otherwise, you'll have the option to export all the private keys onto an excel file and import then into a new wallet.

You have the same problem with Cash.   If a merchant accepted your cash and does not deliver, all you can do is sue them.   
With cash, you can get around this problem by using a second layer solution like a credit card.   A credit card requires some trusts from both the merchant and the buyer to the credit card company.
With Bitcoin, we currently have services like escrows.  But as second layers solution start being develop more, you'll eventually see credit card liked services emerge.

Yes, but who lobbied for those old laws implemented?  They are lobbied by the ISPs themselves.   These are the same ISPs that lobbied $2.6m to get rid of NN.   If we can get rid of old law that allows for competition, NN is not needed.   If we cannot get rid of the old laws, NN is the countermeasure, therefore it must stay.

Most of our wireless carrier do throttle over bandwidth for overage, because they will charge you $10/GB in overages.   Why even slow people down when your customer will pay for overages?
Yes, I am paying $49/month unlimited 330 MB/s with no Netflix lags, no amazon lag.  I use deluge for torrents, and it's super fast(not at 330Mb/s however, because the peer to peer is slow).     
The NN is an anti-trust law.  If ISPs do not behaving in an anticompetitive matter, it does not cause them problem.   In where I live, there is no shortage of bandwidth.  Plenty of people in my building have the $79 per month 1Gb/s running all the time.  With my tiny 300Mb/s, Unless there is an outage somewhere, I don't run into any lag at all.
I have been around pre-2015.  Back then, 330Mb/s was the top speed for my ISPs and it was $79 per month, now 1Gb/s is top speed and I am only paying $49 per month for 330Mb/s.  
Not that I have noticed lags much, if there are intention lag and we found that out, we have a ground on NN to sue them on.  Without NN, what ground?
NN is there the prevent anti-competitive behavior. See blow, this is what it like with ISP monopoly and no NN.

Why? because they are near monopoly and they are also content providers.   They can easily use their position to kill off other content providers that are completing with them too.  If these ISPs do not have a near monopoly position, this is not a problem because users can easily jump to a different ISP.  But in US, 80% of the population do not have much choice.  As oppose to other countries like UK, a user can easily find 50 ISPs that provide service to their home.

Let me give you another example, if you want to buy an iPhone, would you rather buy it from directly from Apple rather than someone selling an iPhone from the back of his car?  
The person who selling iPhone from the back of his car could be selling the real thing, if Apple run out of their stock, a lot of people WILL take the risk and buy from this person, paying a premium for it no less.

I actually trust exchanges less than miner.  Just ask yourself a few questions.   How does exchanges make money?  Do they really care if eth or dash or another coin overtake bitcoin as the number 1 crypto?   
1a. Exchanges make money from volatility.  They make most money when they are a lot of pump and dump coins.  
1b. Exchanges make money from changing from one currency to another.   The more alt coins and fiat currencies available to them the more money they can make from people trading one to another.  
If bitcoin dies tomorrow, they will just continue to make money from the new king of crypto. They are making a killing now with all these conflict going on with bitcoin when people are trading in their bitcoin to eth, dash, bitcoin plus and other alts
Why would you give so much power to entities that does not necessarily have interests in seeing bitcoin succeed at all?   Not that I trust the miners, at least miners are paid in bitcoins, the higher the value bitcoin holds, the more they get paid.

The problem is, exchange make their money from "trading fees".  They do not care what the king of crypto coin is. If Bitcoin dies, they'll just name eth or another coin as new king and continue their merry way.
Another problem is, exchanges already do have incentive to let Bitcoin hard forked into many coins.  If Bitcoin hard fork into 5 different coins today, in the mind, they'll be thinking "more trading, more fee, oh boy".   
The third problem is, some may see some second layer solutions(think decentralized exchanges) as third competition.  They may move to block such a solution ever being implemented.

How many times a day do you see messages like I can't withdraw from Coinbase or my deposit did not come thru and coinbase support never answers after 2 week?  Yet people still actively load money into coinbase everyday. 
Let me ask you, do you leave a lot of coins in an exchange?  I am guessing probably not.  
The people who leave a lot of coins in an exchange are either active traders(with bots likely), who also profit from volatility, or people who are technical enough to know how to install a wallet in a computer,(like my father, who just buy bitcoin and ethereum and leave them at coinbase).

That's a inspection from a law firm, not an full audit from an accounting firm.      This law firm only examine the bitfinex's bank balances, nothing that say those balances are not encumbered by debt.
Let me give you an example, if you only have $250m n the bank, you can easily go out and borrow another $250m from another bank using your original $250m as collateral.    The original $250m is still under your name, and the new $250m is also under your name.   Then, after that, you can borrow from a third bank using second $250m from your second bank as collateral.  Now, you can easily show this law firm you can a total of $750m in bank accounts under your name.
if they need to show more balance, they can just borrow more money.
Until they can prove the balances they have in the bank is unencumbered, the law firm statements are useless.

Decentralized blockchain is much slower and very inefficient compares to centralized database.   How big the block size you envision to have on your blockchain?  if you record all those details for every single cocoa batches you produced, your blockchain will get huge pretty quickly and your batches will be waiting for confirmations for a long time.   Plus, what stop people for reusing old labels from genuine one on something that's produced somewhere else? 
If two batches have the same label, how can you tell which batch is the real one?  While crypto currencies like bitcoin are impossible counterfeited, it is not true for products that will have labels applied onto them afterward.

Coinbase let people deposit their BTCs.  It also used to allow other people borrow their BTCs to trade on Margin on their GDAX.

Derivatives take many forms.  Not all derivatives have a debt component.   Take CME bitcoin futures for example.   1 Contract is equal to 5 BTCs.  Their contract settle in USD, not bitcoin.  There are 0 real bitcoin on the blockchain involved.   Many institution buyers will just buy this form of Bitcoin instead of owning real bitcoin.  They can buy thousands of bitcoin if they wanted.
Bitcoin itself is limited, however you can stop third parties popping up creating derivative forms of bitcoin.   You cannot stop people from going to these third parties and use these derivatives as their bitcoin ownership instead.  And, derivatives have no limit, you can create any form of derivatives your mind can imagine.

VPN used by private companies are not configured to same as VPN you buy from the Internet.   VPN you are using from your company does not hide your traffic, it only route your company traffic back to your company while everything else still go through your regular ISP.  If you run a bitcoin node while you are using your company's VPN, you are still using your own IP address, not your company's.
VPN you buy from public route everything through their servers, your own ip address will be masked by their server IPs.

They are banks.   Bitmex definitely runs on a fractional system.   If you deposit 1 BTC into Bitmex and use their 100x margins to buy 100 BTC, Bitmex do not have the 100 BTC.

I don't think the any one party including should have the ultimate voting power.  All stakeholders should be involved.
These are some questions to think about.  
What makes you think the exchange will not become political like the miners now?   
What makes you think exchanges will not eventually consolidate and become centralized themselves?   
Once centralization happened, what makes you think they will act in the best interest of their users?

Hold, hold, hold...I am not someone who is for mining having all the voting power.  I hate centralization, whether miners or exchanges.  I just don't like centralization.
  
What I was saying was exchange centralization will actually will be worse than miner centralization.  You do not have to agree with me.  That's just my opinion.
I have lost faith in exchange long time ago.  I lost a decent amount(more than 20) of coins when Cryptsy collapse, Mintpal collapse and Bter hacks.  I personally believe some of the collapse are caused by fraud(mt gox, cryptsy and minpal, etc) by their exchange owners themselves.   
My opinion is voting with you feet is over estimated.  First of all, not a lot of people will vote with the feet at all.  Looks at the way some big mining pools now, many small miners can actually vote with their feet, but most just wont budge.   
Secondly, people in power will gladly give up short term profit in order to consolidate power.  Looks at the way some miners are behaving now, they do not seem to care at all when bitcoin price go down at all, even at the risk that there is a chance that their total investments of bitcoin mining hardware may become worthless.  
With exchanges, that's even worse, because you taking your bitcoin elsewhere will not hurt them at all.   There is nothing that can cause their investment to become totally worthless at all.  There are always other big traders will want to trade.  There are always plenty of other altcoins for exchanges to make profit from.   What's worse is, exchanges do not any incentive to line with what users and business actually want too.  
POS vote may be a good idea if we can somehow exclude exchanges and only allow users and businesses to votes.  I do not think that's possible with coding though.

Same reason you are not arbitraging the hell out of bitcoin by converting your USD to RMB, then buy bitcoin with a Chinese exchange and sell them back to USD again.  
It's a big hassle for you to get your USD to convert to RMB and deposit it into a chinese exchange.   Likewise it's a big hassle for a person in China to convert their RMB into USD and sent them out of the country to a USD exchange.  It just not easy to send any significant amount of fiats into and/or out of China.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:30:15
Yes, water will stop dividing on molecular level.  Bitcoin cannot be infinitely divisible too.  No matter how advance the computer you are going to use, there will be a finite number of decimal places.
If everyone on earth uses bitcoin, bitcoin total capitalization should roughly equal the entire world's money supply defined as "Narrow money" see link below.  In this case, 1 bitcoin is roughly equal $1.5 million USD, or 1 satoshi is equal to 1.5 cent USD.  The current number of decimal place should be enough for a long long time.

People were moving to Alts because a lot of the ICOs were popping 10x, 20x or 100x the initial investment in a relatively short time.    These hundreds of new ICOs also dilute the market causing the BTC domination to go down quickly.   Also, a lot of the ICOs accept Ethereum only.   This caused ethereum to sky rocket too.  However, lately, the recent ICOs has not done well.  Quite a few new ICOs falls below ICO price.   People are less hyped on ICOs now.  Ethereum's price is also cooling a little bit.

Tor is not as totally as anonymous as you think.  A state level security expert can easily unmask you. 
Also, if you relay traffic from inside of china to outside china, you'll need to have two ip addresses.  One to communicate to the node inside China, another IP proxy ip to communicate to outside China.  The IP on the Tor Bridges will not be able to communicate directly back to another node inside China without going thru your China based IP address on the client.  Bitcoin nodes are not anonymous too.   The Chinese government can easily write a script to query the blockchain and find all China based IP addresses that are relaying traffic to the outside of china blockchain and block network traffic from inside China.
Anyway, this will be cat and mouse game, people will find way around that, then China can figure out how to block it again.   
Because Chinese is controlling the entire Internet inside china, they can do this much better than other countries, like the US. 
All I was trying to say in my original answer to the topic was, it's possible for China government to disrupt Bitcoin pretty much for free instead of spending Billions like other people suggested, because they already have everything they needed to do this job in place.
@_date: 2016-10-20 12:19:11
I see your some of your points.  But what if China blocks the traffic permanently?  We are going to run the Bitcoin network entirely with some bottleneck on some Satelitte phones, long wave radio or waiting for someone to bring and MicroSD card to cross the border?.  And, don't forget, China's firewall has the ability to stop bitcoin traffic to stop running inside china.  All IP addresses that routeable inside China has to pass thru Chinese government controlled equipment at some point.
@_date: 2016-10-20 12:13:08
The thing is Satellite connections and 4G near the border will connect you to outside China, but the IP traffic will still have to pass thru the great firewall of China to come back into China.   This just mean you are physically in china, but your node is outside of China.
Of course, if someone have a computer that connects both from outside of China and inside of China at the same time, then it will work.  
China also have ability to Ban any IP traffic from inside china if it wants to.  All Chinese routeable IP addresses has to go thru Government controlled equipment at some point.
@_date: 2016-10-19 11:50:38
If this state is China, then it's free.   The Chinese government owns the "Great Firewall of China" which they can use to stop any internet traffic going in and out of the country.  All they have to do here is block any bitcoin traffic from going into and out of China, then the Bitcoin network will essentially fork into two, a Chinese Bitcoin and Rest of the world bitcoin.  Let's say Chinese government unblock the bitcoin traffic one week later, given that the Chinese citizens control more hashrate than the rest of the world thereby will have a longer block chain, their chain will automatically overwrite the "rest of the world" chain and erase all these rest of the world bitcoin transactions for that week.

China have can block anything internally also.  They are already actively censoring all kinds critical comments and shutting down sites that are bad mouthing the government internally.  Given that bitcoin nodes are never anonymous, unless it is done manually via sdcard like you mentioned, the government can easily write a script to find which node is acting as a relay to "rest of the world" and block the bitcoin traffic as soon as they appear.

You are looking at it from the bank's point of view.    Try to look at the entire economy, then you'll see things differently.
Person A: Deposited 11K BTC in a bank.... As far as he is concerned, he own 11K BTC.
Person B: Borrowed 10K BTC from a bank and used to to pay person C for let's say some Gold.   He has no BTC.
Person C: Who received 10K from Person B and deposit 10K BTC to the bank.  As far as he is concerned, he has 10K BTC.
(ignoring interest) Between deposits and loans, the bank's net asset and liability is 0.
From above the entire economy has 22K BTC.
Bank 2 which has the 10K BTC can now lend 9K to person D to make the economy bigger.

Yes you can apply your trading skills there.  However, a lot of these crypto exchanges are full of with automatic trading bots probably using the same technical signals you are planning to use.   You'll likely have to spend some time in learning these bots' behaviors and find a way to beat us.   Or if you are too lazy to do that, you can join them by buying a bot of your own.  A typical bot cost about 0.1 to 0.2 bitcoin.  The more advanced ones where you can customize more signals will cost you more.

if the reserved ratio is let's say 10%, then someone would have to deposited aprox 11,000BTC into the bank.   The bank would take out 10,000BTC to lend to a borrower.   These will leave only 1,000BTC in the bank's wallet even though the depositor have 11,000BTC on his bank statement.    The bank in this case is holding about 10% of the total depositor's BTC, thus this is called fractional-reserve banking.
The borrower spend his 10K BTC and the person who will receive from this borrower will deposit this 10K btc into another this same bank or another bank.    This new bank will lend 90% out to another borrower.   The fractional reserve banks are creating BTC this way.
This will only work if the deposit do not want to withdraw all their BTC at once.
