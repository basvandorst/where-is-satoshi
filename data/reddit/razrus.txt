i lost coins at gox and i dont care about any new news anymore

I've been checking the news as well. Not that I think there is any hope of getting my BTC back, I just want to see some sort of justice and closure.

I asked a friend who works at a local Fire Fighter credit union and she said it most certainly would be "red flagged"

If your transaction is on hold, you may need to verify it via email.

Such a huge day for bitcoin

i just transfered my funds to coinbase, and into my bank account, over $80.00 F@ dollars in fees between the 2 exchanges, so ridiculous.

Thanks for the replies, it took me 2 months to get my money out of gox because of the stupid maximum withdrawal policy.  Looks like im out of the bitcoin game though, kinda sad, it was fun while it lasted

ha, i have no speculation, just done with it, i cashed in when bitcoin reached $166.  Hasnt been near that since.  I was tired of constantly looking at the price, reading off the wall speculations, bull traps, alleged price manipulations, noobs who sell at the drop of a hat when it starts to tank, alot of other factors.
