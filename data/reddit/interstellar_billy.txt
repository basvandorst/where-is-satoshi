This has nothing to do with tech, just price. Eventually Monero will be unaffected by BTC price, but until you can easily buy Monero with fiat on most exchanges the price will be linked to BTC. The tide comes in and BTC flows to Alts, the tide goes out and Alts flow to BTC. Monero is down 20% and we probably have a 1 or 2 more of these cycles left in 2018 until larger cap coins are available to be purchased in fiat

Very real possibility. Hypothetical scenario: Institutional buyer pumps price of BTC with 400 million dollars leading up to CME futures launch. This creates major fomo so that everyone and their mom starts buying BTC which pumps the price even more. Institutional money then takes out a 50 million dollar short position. Future launch and they dump 400 million in btc to take profits on the btc they purchased over the last few weeks. This crashes the market, and then they collect on the 50 million dollar short position as well. They may not be successful, but they will try and it will most likely work in the short term. If you are a long term HODLER you will be fine. I would not be taking long positions at these levels though. It may keep going up, but smart investors ignore fomo and buy the dips not ATH’s. BTC is well overdue for a dip. It can’t go up $2k  a day forever...

What will you do when you sell before you go to bed after a 10% gain and the price of BTC goes up 30% over night... You will buy back in at a higher price and then BTC will dip 50% and you will loose all of your money. If you want to be a successful trader realize 3 things: less than 5% of people in crypto are successful at it, the ones who are dedicate every waking hour of their day to it, and you will loose money before you make money. The learning curve is steep. Making money is hard. If trading BTC was easy we would all do it. Most of us have tried. Be content with the fact that you can get 1000% annual gains from hodling.

Fees provide an incentive to maintain the network and protect against corruption. Nano uses DPOS which is not a trust-less system. Fees are not always bad. In BTC's case they are an advantage, because they insure that your money is safe. The value of BTC is the size and scope of the network. It may take much longer to scale and reach consensus, but democracy was never fast. That's what dictatorships are good for. NANO is cool, but it is not decentralized, and until that is fixed, it is much more likely to fail.

I like Gemini, Kraken is great too, Coinbase is the most commonly used... There are a lot of different ways to buy bitcoin. 
I would suggest buying a hardware wallet first (Trezor or Ledger Nano S) and practice sending a small amount of BTC to your wallet. Honestly, the only way to really understand how bitcoin works is to try it out... If you decide to get more serious about it, you do not want to keep your bitcoin on an exchange like Coinbase.

If you have done your research and you truly believe in the tech then I would say go for it. Be honest with yourself though... Are you ok with losing that money? The problem with bitcoin is there is honestly never a "good time" to invest. We could be at the peak of a bubble, we could be at the beginning of its most historic rise period. I choose to invest because I believe it has the potential to change the world, I accept that I could be wrong, but I can't imagine watching Bitcoin succeed from the sidelines. I want to be a part of the incredible community, and for me personally, that is worth the risk.

No worries buddy! Looks like Gemini is back up too. In terms of withdrawing your BTC, you need to wait until your deposit clears from your bank account. (Unfortunately this can take roughly 5 business days) It's much quicker to wire money directly from your bank account, but you do get charged a $25 transaction fee by most banks. I would only wire if you are going to send a few thousand dollars. Otherwise, just be patient. No reason to get FOMO while you are waiting for your deposits to clear. Just buy a few hundred dollars at a time and watch some youtube videos on buying the dips, and dollar cost averaging while you wait for your deposits to clear.

Gemini had some trouble last week, but they have a scheduled maintenance at this time every Thursday, 9pm - 12 am EST... (Technically it should have ended 10 minutes ago).. Crypto is exploding though, so it's to be expected.  still hasn't let me link my bank account. I signed up May 3rd and have sent several emails... Still have heard nothing. We have to be patient.

The reality is that BTC will probably never scale to be an everyday currency. It might, but currently the community is too scared to support the technology upgrades that are necessary to use BTC as a currency. BCH or B2X would theoretically make better currencies. People are afraid that any major changes to the network will make the value drop. BTC has evolved into a store of value, and that's honestly ok. It allows people in countries with corrupt governments to escape the perils of hyperinflation. It also allows people to send large sums of money across the globe without a bank. That's amazing! BTC has sewn the seeds of a decentralized revolution. Even if we end up using a different coin for everyday transactions, BTC will always have it's place as a store of value. BTC does not need to become an everyday currency for Satoshi Nakamoto's vision of a decentralized fiat system to be achieved.

Both. Dollar cost average weekly with 50-70%  what you can afford to invest. Save 30% of your fiat for a big dip. Then when it dips big don’t chicken out, double down and buy as much cheap BTC as you can afford.
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:04:58
A big dip would be a 30-50% dip. A little bit of fundamental technical analysis goes a long way. Learn how to read a chart. Understand the meaning of “previous resistance becomes future support.” This will help you understand good places to set your buy orders. You will never be able to predict exactly what will cause a dip, when it will happen, or how far it will drop. To mitigate your risk, buy more the lower the price goes - or dollar cost average the dip. 
Hypothetically you might have $3,000 to invest in BTC and $1,000 of that is set aside for buying dips. With that $1,000: If BTC goes down to 7k, you might buy $100 worth. If it goes to 6k you might then buy $300, if it keeps dropping all the way to 5k you might spend your last $600... Remember, there is no guarantee that it will drop back to 5k, but if it does, you want to make sure you have money to invest. 
Even if you don’t set you buy levels perfectly don’t beet yourself up if you miss the bottom of a dip. That’s why you dollar cost average the dip. It’s tough to call the bottom, but there will always be another dip. You want to make sure you have cash when that next dip comes. 
If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that BTC always goes much higher than you expect and also much  much lower as well. Just look back at historical charts when China banned ICO’s in early September. BTC’s all time high at the time was $4,800, and it dropped to $2,900, and now it’s approaching 8k... HODL.
I️ hope that helps! ��

BTC is also centralized... You can make the argument that BCH is more centralize but a small percentage of the world population controls the majority of the BTC supply, and a handful of miners with access to private investment and more efficient mining equipment control the vast majority of mining operations.

The people who do this successfully generally provide something to the community in exchange for using their referral link.

It will make BTC less volatile, and it will open up the necessary channels for institutional money. It will not prevent it from going up in value. BTC will maintain its deflationary properties... I might argue it’s a good thing... This will help BTC scale. It will help BTC gain more support from powerful/connected investors which will help prevent detrimental regulation. This is good news for BTC and crypto as a whole.

Overstock was meant to be a hypothetical example... I tend to agree with you, but I also think that a lot of people are starting to view BTC as a commodity, and accepting that it may never be a “currency.” Does this hinder adoption? Also, regardless of how successful BCH is, Roger Ver has been quite successful at publicizing the scalability issues BTC is currently having. Does this open the door for a superior technology to “dethrone” BTC. It has proven to be incredibly resilient, and while I believe it will continue to be, I’m trying to poke holes in my own beliefs because at the end of the day BTC is only 10ish years old.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:10:32
If you are that worried, it might be time to sell. No one can tell the future, and owning Bitcoin should not be a source of negativity. If you have made 4-5x on what you initially put in, consider taking out your initial investment to lower your risk.

Market manipulation in its truest form. Regardless of which you support BTC or BCH... what happened tonight is definitely bad for crypto in the short term.

BTC can’t succeed as a currency unless corporations accept it as a form of payment. PEOPLE like bitcoin for a lot of reasons, but 90% of people like it because it makes them money. As an investment vehicle BTC is definitely superior. It’s the only crypto with a large enough market cap to absorb institutional money. As a currency though it is currently lacking. Selling BCH or other alts to corporations is not a joke. Corporate adoption will play a large role in this market over the next 5 years.

Yes, every time you sell it is considered a taxable event. If you purchased Bitcoin for $3,500 and sold at $5,900 you should pay taxes on the profits. Even if you bought back in at a higher price the following day, you still made a profit and you are subject to taxes on that profit. If you held that Bitcoin for a minimum of a year you qualify for a reduced tax rate known as long-term capital gains. If you did not hold the bitcoin for a year it is considered short-term capital gains. 
Short-term capital gains do not benefit from any special tax rate – they are taxed at the same rate as your ordinary income. For 2017, ordinary tax rates range from 10 percent to 39.6 percent, depending on your total taxable income. If you sell an asset you have held for one year or less, any profit you make is considered a short-term capital gain. The clock begins ticking from the day after you acquire the asset up to and including the day you sell it.
If you sold the bitcoin at a loss... Say your purchased at 7k sold at 6k and bought back in at a higher price you can report it as a capital loss and receive a tax credit.

It shocks me how many people jump in head first, buy at a high sell a low and then their strategy becomes HODL... Dollar Cost Averaging is the name of the game. If you wanna get even better, set buy orders at certain levels based on rudimentary technical analysis. for example during this last crash. What if you had buy orders set like so: .25 BTC at $3,650, .5 BTC at $3,450 and 1 BTC at $3,100. All of those would have filled and you would be pretty happy right now. There is no way to know for sure when BTC will crash, but you should be able to predict the support levels "if" it were to crash. It's good to keep fiat on hand so that you can have pending buy orders that will fill when BTC dips. Your buy orders should be more aggressive the more BTC goes down. They are not guaranteed to fill, but this is how you catch the dips.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:00:08
I'm hoping we don't see sub 3k, but if it dips below $3,400 the next support line is $2,900... Make your plan and stick with it. Good luck to everyone! :)

With a lot of personal research and a basic understanding of technical analysis many people successfully trade bitcoin. There is a fairly large community of people who trade against other altcoins on large exchanges like bittrex. I dabble, and have been fairly successful. You need to have a plan, understand how to buy dips and when to take profits. I personally like to stick with coins that have a large trade volume and market cap. I make a point not to be too greedy. For example, I have successfully swing traded Lite Coin for a 20% Bitcoin Profit several times. If you are chasing coins that are going up by 100% in a day, you will most likely loose money on pump and dumps, but if you buy the dips on well established coins and take profits that are reasonable for the crypto world (10-30%) you can make good money. My personal belief is that bitcoin is king, so once a month I evaluate my trades and ask myself did I actually make money, or would I have been better off just leaving it in BTC? My ultimate goal is to grow my BTC and HODL, so I only trade with a small portion of my BTC and then move my BTC profits to my harware wallet once a month.

I have never seen a positive Bitcoin article on MarketWatch. It honestly blows my mind. I don't expect everyone to jump on the bandwagon, but you would think that they would at least entertain opposing viewpoints. Left-wing media outlets will post right-wing opinion pieces from time to time and vice versa. Even if Market Watch is just pushing an agenda, acknowledging the other side of the argument would help legitimize their opinion. I welcome skepticism because I am still skeptical, but time and time again Market Watch continues to post articles that prove how little research they have done. Seeking Alpha seems to cover both sides of the bitcoin debate. WTF??

If you bought $1,000 worth of bitcoin in 2010 you would have made a good amount of money, but you also would have probably out sold it when it hit $13. Even if you didn't sell then I find it hard to believe anyone would have hodled their entire stash until now...

DO NOT SELL... You need to invest with a plan. Ask your self why you bought bitcoin. If you looked at the charts before you purchased you had to know it would come down at some point. IT ALWAYS DOES. Over the last 7 years it has also doubled every 8 months on average. You bought at  a high, but it will go back up. If you don't believe it will go up in the long run you should have never bought in the first place. Welcome to the roller coaster buddy, you will be fine :). Look up dollar cost averaging and if you decide to buy more in the future do not go all in at once.

The stock market is due for a correction, could happen next week could happen in 3 years, but the stock market crashing does not automatically mean BTC will take off. The stock market is filled with money from large conservative institutions, the retirement savings of average citizens etc... These are not the same type of people who invest in BTC thus money coming out of the stock market does not equal money going into BTC. If your are 40+ years old you likely agree with Jamie Dimon and do not view BTC as a legitimate asset. People do tend to move their money into commodities such as gold when the stock market crashes, but gold has been around since the dawn of civilization, BTC is less than a decade old. 
Don't get me wrong, I like to think we are at the beginning of technological revolution that will fundamentally change our financial institutions, but we are not there yet. There is still a lot left to prove. It's easy to forget that the crypto community is relatively small and sheltered... You could honestly be right, but it's still dangerous to operate under this sort of assumption. BTC is a small market full of inexperienced investors who are easily spooked. I would guess that if the stock market were to crash tomorrow so would BTC. If BTC is resilient, it may come back from such a crash stronger than ever before, that will be the true test...

Currency will always be used to purchase things for good and bad. Doesn't matter if its cash, gold, Bitcoin or Monero. Articles that target how bitcoin is used to lander money and purchase illicit goods are designed to grab people's attention and generate clicks. If you take 2 seconds to think about the history of money you will realize that nothing has changed since it's inception. Bitcoin is no different, it is just technologically more advanced than the dollar bill, so people are starting to use Bitcoin for things they once used dollars for. Longterm it will have 0 negative impact on Bitcoin... The worst thing that could happen to Bitcoin would be a different alt coin like Monero becoming more popular... Then people would just buy guns with Monero.

You need to hold your coins on your own wallet, preferably a hardware wallet. Gemini has no obligation to provide you with your extra coins after the fork (They may or may not). It is technically not your Bitcoin until after you move it off of the exchange. Although Gemini is a very reputable exchange, if they were to get hacked or go bankrupt tomorrow they would owe you nothing. You should not own bitcoin until you have the knowledge of how to hold your own coins. Crypto is the Wild West and protection is limited. In a traditional fiat bank your money is insured by the FDIC. Your Bitcoin is not. Your Bitcoin is only as safe as you make it.

Dollar cost average now, but don't deploy all of your cash... Wait for a dip. the next dip may be higher than we are at now, but waiting for a dip is part of lowering your risk. Additionally, you want to have cash to deploy when it dips. The lower bitcoin goes the more money you should put in. 
If I was going to deploy 10k in today's market I would add $250 - $500 a week so that I don't miss out if it keeps running up, but I would hold out for a dip back to $4,900. It's not guaranteed to go back to $4900, but if it does your going to want to have 5k to buy a whole bitcoin so that you can take advantage of the blood in the streets... Remember a month ago when $4,900 was the ATH and it dropped all the way back to $2,900? It always dipps. You make money on the buy side. A smart investor has a plan that lowers their risk, and they stick to it.

Correct, it only covers your cash balance at the time of the hack. Anything that is in BTC is not covered.

DO NOT SELL... You need to invest with a plan. Ask your self why you bought bitcoin. If you looked at the charts before you purchased you had to know it would come down at some point. IT ALWAYS DOES. Over the last 7 years it has also doubled every 8 months on average. You bought at  a high, but it will go back up. If you don't believe it will go up in the long run you should have never bought in the first place. Welcome to the roller coaster buddy, you will be fine :). Look up dollar cost averaging and if you decide to buy more in the future do not go all in at once.

I’m confused on what you are trying to gain from this. What sort of benefit do you get from proving Mycelium hasn’t been hacked? Maybe Mycelium has been hacked maybe it hasn’t, I doubt this post will reach enough people to prove either. It will probably just give you false confidence.
Anything that has ever been hacked had previously not been hacked at some point. The reality is this: no wallet is impervious to hacking. Not even hardware wallets. That being said, it would be much more difficult to hack a hardware wallet. Thus, it is a better use of a hackers time to try and hack the easier target. Mycelium is less secure. If you own a significant amount of BTC you have accepted the responsibility of being your own bank, and you should take security seriously. Mycelium doesn’t owe you a thing if you’re money is stolen.

Fellow Washingtonian here - I use Gemini and I love it. BECU was not on their list of banks, so I opened a new bank account solely for buying Bitcoin and it works like a charm. takes a little more work, but now I have a separate bank account solely for buying Bitcoin. Be thankful Gemini Operates in Washington State :) they weren't approved until August.

Submit a photo of your drivers license and it takes about 1 week. After that, you just need to link your bank account which is really quick. It takes a few days for deposits to be activated, but you can wire money instantly. I actually ended up using Gemini because I couldn't figure out how to get past teir 3 on Kraken, and Coinbase still won't let me deposite Fiat - I've sent like 30 emails with 0 replies. Been waiting since March and my account is still locked lol.

Blows my mind how many people have their coins on exchanges. I spent a lot of time researching bitcoin before making my initial investment. The responsibility of being my own bank was a bit overwhelming tbh. I purchased a hardware wallet before I purchased any BTC. It helps me sleep at night...
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:05:10
Good luck! It’s a lot better than leaving it on an exchange, which is what most people do starting out.

If you have 2fa enabled on Gemini you are required to enter it both for logging in and transferring money out of your account. Whoever transferred the money would need access to Authy... Did they disable 2fa once they logged into your account??

There is a correlation, but you will likely not be able to make profitable trades based on general patterns that everyone knows about. Theoretically there is a lot of money to be made in altcoins, but... It's hyper competitive, and people who are better than you at trading who are privileged to better information will eat your lunch. If you want to outperform BTC be prepared to dedicate multiple hours a day and understand you will likely not succeed. For most people it is far more profitable and far less stressful to stick with BTC.

Don’t think this constitutes a dip... $4,900 would be a dip. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t buy though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Sounds like you probably have Malware...
You shouldn’t torrent, download bootlegs, or visit porn sites on the computer you use for crypto. You also should avoid windows if possible. If you are investing what you consider to be large sums of money purchase an old MacBook or a cheap Linux based laptop and dedicate it to crypto.
Sorry for your loss, but it’s a cheap lesson in the grand scheme of things. There are many people on this sub who have lost tens of thousands of dollars through similar circumstances.

“Girls don’t get cryptography and higher mathematics?” Please, tell me of your great understanding of cryptography and “higher” mathematics lol.
I work for a large Seattle tech company and our Chief Data Scientists is a woman. I would not be surprised to hear that crypto is a male dominated space, but definitely not for the reasons you listed. You are either just trolling, or hopelessly full of sh*t.

No storage method is perfect, but I would agree that the Nano S is the best combination of security, convenience and price. Just make sure to have a good cold storage plan in place for storing your seed words. I would suggest memorizing them.

What if Amazon starts accepting BTC, but they don’t immediately sell... They hodl... What if Bezos actually spends his days at work posting hodl memes on this subreddit... What if Bezos is just trying to gain the largest global stake in BTC... Then once BTC does scale and fiat becomes worthless Amazon will secure its dominance as a global superpower... ��

Your right and I do. I'm about 50% Bitcoin 25% Neo, and I have some ETH and LTC as well :).

Decide how much you are willing to invest and buy a little bit at a time over the next 10 weeks to lower your risk (Look up dollar cost averaging). It's very hard to time the market, especially if you have no experience doing so. You most likely won't be able to call the bottom, and if you are new to crypto you may be too afraid to invest when next time it crashes. The internet goes haywire with misinformation and people calling for the end of Bitcoin whenever there is a major dip. Just get some skin in the game, otherwise you'll be left behind ;)

1. If you are going to buy an altcoin, you should understand how blockchain tech works, read their whitepaper, research the team behind the coin on linkedin, and ask yourself: How is their product different than something that already exists? Start by researching difference between BTC and LTC, and why Segwit2x was important.
2. 
3. Correct, my strategy is based on the idea that Bitcoin has serious upward potential. I have done the research, and I believe that Bitcoin has a long way to go. Even if I lose money (USD) in the short term, as long as I am gaining Bitcoin with my trades, I am making money in the long run.
