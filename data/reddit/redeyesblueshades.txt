Don't go all in until you can consistently see a profit in your trading. Start as a serious hobby.

Someone please reply to his tweet and tell him April's fool day was two weeks ago.
(I don't have Twitter.)

OK, the guy is undeniably a fuckwit with an attitude problem and/or a god complex, but you also didn't really pay attention to what he was saying. Some of the stuff you report as him "claiming" is completely wrong. 
Example, the comment about banks. He doesn't say banks should be the only ones mining. He claimed that even if banks were the only ones mining, the system would still be decentralised. His argument, 17,000 banks/nodes is more nodes than today AND no chance on Earth they'd collude - aka control everything - because that's what a cartel does, and no cartel survives in the long run. And then gives the example of De Beers the diamonds overlords.
I'm not technically competent enough to counter or support his technical claims, but all he's saying is we want big blocks, and we're gonna get them, period. Not much else, aside from all the bombastic claims about how awesome he is, that is.

Don't apologize for your own creations... if someone doesn't like it, they can click "Back" on the browser. It's your creation, and you shared it with everyone else to watch for free. End of.
And just btw, I thought it was actually kinda cool.

Always a bit puzzled when people spend big $$$ to send BTC, like that journalist chick trying to survive on BTC in NYC. I bought my Trezor 12 days ago (still waiting!!!) and paid the exact same fee, 0.0001 BTC. Went through no problems.
Used an ages old, non-updated MultiBit wallet.

Thanks for the explanation!!

OK, so the question becomes how do I do it?

You two should just get married.

It's not accidental... News came out of a co wanting to provide a bitcoin solution for the marijuana industry. They deal with cash only, no bank would accept their money!! It's speculation that one of these coins may end up being the adopted solution.

Skeptical... How do you enforce the 1:1 FX rate? If you leave it to market forces, it will break the 'peg' very quickly. Maybe I'm missing it, but I don't see the (game theoretical) argument why would 1:1 persist.
