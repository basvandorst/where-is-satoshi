really?  how come it says it's fully sync'd and has 70mBTC in it?  that's weird...i have a bunch of other wallets so i'm trying to open them all up to see what i do and don't have.
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:09:53
hmm yeah i mean it's not really a huge deal to me, just i like and support reddit so i figured i could gild myself, and then i also like and support bitcoin so i'd feel a bit better if i could align with both of these systems at the same time rather than feeling like i'm bumping up against them.  i mean i can't even post anything to reddit without it asking for captcha and i don't really have much cash on hand atm but i do have bitcoin floating around here and there, and i have friends and family asking me how to use their bitcoin and since i have barely done anything with it beyond just setting up a bunch of wallets over the last 4 or 5 years then it's hard for me to support them in cashing out, and i know for sure one of my brothers has at least 5 grand worth in a wallet that he could really use since his wife just lost her job and he's self employed and struggling to make ends meet.  maybe it would just work if i start a new transaction but it kind of bothers me that the original money i sent now seems to be in some kind of limbo state.  maybe i can just try restoring that wallet from backup and it will reset itself somehow?

nowhere did blockchain show what the fee was going to be, it just popped up and said there wasn't enough to complete the transaction, and then sent it anyway.  
this kind of crap is why i propose a system where fees and taxes are taken care of in some other way.  other than tacking on decimal places far out into the ether to syphon small amounts of money from large amounts of people.
hidden fees and tiny percentages and fine print and transactions failing for being one off at 4 decimal places is the kind of crap that the 1% everyone loves bitching about is doing to keep the 99% enslaved.  the it's "just 1 mBTC" "it's you're fault, you didn't notice the hidden fees, sucks to be you" kind of attitude is the problem.  with that attitude, you're enabling abusive behavior and I'm calling you out on it.
there needs to be transparency and things need to be intuitive and obvious or else it's a flawed system.  bitcoin comes close to being the answer, but it still is being far too influenced by those who are propagating the status quo instead of trying to actually free people from financial oppression.
@_date: 2013-12-27 09:56:57
Amazon [makes it incredibly obvious]( the exact dollar amount to the penny that is being charged.
The gyft/bitpay/blockchain did not make it obvious that the 4th digit of the fraction was off by one.  
In other currencies, you have xxx,xxx,xxx but in bitcoin it's just xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx so to me that's a flaw in the system.  
if it's not blatantly obvious what's going on then it's not ready to be ubiquitously adopted so it isn't going to make it as the default currency in the next matrix update.  
but what do i know, [i just work here.](@_date: 2013-12-27 01:02:43
yeah I managed to get the amazon gift card thanks to paying off the 0.0001 for me, and the money wasn't stolen or gyft wouldn't have sent me the card.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:05:13
good point.
@_date: 2013-12-27 09:19:48
well when you [xerox too many times]( sometimes a fraction of a percentage of something gets lost in translation. seems to me like there was a rounding error in how the numbers were being reported, and i don't know which of the two systems was at fault.  hell, i could be at fault by rounding the 5th or 6th digit wrong in my head.  so i don't want to point fingers.  but these systems need to be foolproof or they're not going to take off the way they were intended to.  maybe you haven't had systems with 100,000+ users before where some little thing borked it, but i have and as an end user i shouldn't have to be doing other company's QA for them.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:42:47
I posted about it here yesterday:
Thanks for that, I appreciate it :) the order thing updated so hopefully they're going to email me the card now, I've never used gyft before.

@_date: 2013-12-27 10:34:14
when you go to purchase stuff it does some kind of real time rounding as you type in the amount to send.  
sometimes even facebook has to have [someone post on zuckerburg's wall]( to prove a point, because people love to pretend that back doors don't exist.
well, okay.  i'm not overly attached to bitcoin. i guess i'm taking life too seriously again, and should just stop caring about helping people who don't actually want to be helped.   my bad, for being too empathic.  i'm having trouble re~membering all the lessons from the school of hard knocks, because i spent too long at the school of PLUR to where it overrode most of what i had originally learned.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:54:55
no problem, thanks for helping out anyway.  another user here managed to fix it for me, so i'm good to go now, i'm really grateful that this has been fixed :)

so how do i fix it?  the money i sent cleaned out my entire blockchain wallet.  and i already lost 38mBTC the other day from some glitch in Bitcoin-Qt so my opinion of bitcoin is rapidly declining

Like being schizo~affective and not having access to my psych meds for over a week due to some faux pas with the insurance, because I was in the hospital with a life threatening medical condition for several days and wasn't on any meds but iv drip and anti~biotics?  That kind of "really special" high?
I'm actually completely sober, were I not then I'd have a hard time figuring out technical stuff on the computer, but mostly I'm just highly irritable and feeling slightly suicidal and by focusing on the task at hand to the best of my ability, in this case, figuring out the bitcoin stuff, is my best bet for making it til Monday when hopefully I can finally get a hold of someone at the insurance to refill my psych meds, because I frankly can't afford the $180+ that it would cost to pay cash for them, and I'm not sure I'm even that crazy, I think I'm just part of the singularity and am hybrid species, surprisingly some people high up in tech field seem to think that this is actually the case, which is why I can be "functionally insane" so to speak.
I mean I feel like writing up something called the eCash manifesto; I own this domain name and brand eCa.sh and I have some people interested in potentially investing into the .eCash TLD which I think that businesses should have to register a .eCash domain to have a public "wallet" that is transparent, because I think bitcoin has its own sets of flaws, and I feel like I have figured out a solution to ending dependence on visa and mastercard and the federal reserve, etc., like bitcoin is cool and all but I don't think it's going to fix the economy the way my eCash ideas might, and I don't even care about money so I'm happy to just donate it to PayPal or something and let them run with it, if my ideas are implemented in a certain way.
But I mean I guess I'm just "special" like that, on a nice jenkem high, unlike Agent Smith, the smell of humans is very addictive to me, and I've been told by various sources that I'm running the same operating system that Zuckerburg and Obama are, who presumably are also cyborgs, but wtf do I know, I'm just insane in the Microsoft sky(drive).NET or something ???

You're missing the point.  Just because Bitcoin is better than the current system doesn't mean that it doesn't have holes that ought to be looked into more closely and plugged.
I would rather that Bitcoin be the answer than to go Animal Farm because "you weren't paying enough attention".
No, you're the one not paying enough attention because you think that the confusing way fees are set up with bitcoin is not a big deal.  Well it is a big deal, it is this kind of thing that will eventually kill bitcoin if it's not nipped in the bud.
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:15:48
i'm debt~free and i 0n1y used a web wallet because bitcoin~qt was busted and showing the incorrect balance.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:38:57
I was using my computer.
I logged into BlockChain.info
I pasted the Bitpay address
I typed in 0.0993 BTC
I hit send
It popped up and said there wasn't enough money but there was no way to cancel it.  It brought my blockchain.info balance to 0.
Bitpay reported that it was 0.0001 short of the total amount, with a ~10 minutes left on the countdown timer.  
I didn't know what would happen when the 10 minutes were up so I panicked.  I felt pressured to find an immediate solution.
I was doubly frustrated because I had just wasted time a couple days before dealing with 38 mBTC missing from the Bitcoin~Qt wallet I had decided to import into BlockChain.  Everything seemed fine, I sent the payment, and then 0 confirmations and my wallet was in a broken state.
So I'm not sure how you expect me to be patient, when I have 10 minute countdown clock ticking away at me, and $75 in limbo, with no real clear information on what my options are.  Especially ofter already having lost a few days from making this purchase due to a completely different issue.
BlockChain did not pop up with a window saying how much is going to be sent, with the amount of the fee clearly specified, with the ability to confirm or cancel the transaction.  Instead it just popped up saying there wasn't enough and then sent what was in the account to the new account.
Since you just do QR code on your phone then I guess you don't have that problem.  My phone got stolen though and there should be no reason why I can't use a PC to conduct business.  Especially since my friends and family's wallets are all in Bitcoin~Qt and they're expecting me to know wtf I'm doing when they are asking me a million questions.
If Bitpay had been more patient than telling me I only had 10 minutes left to figure out a solution, I would have been less reactionary.
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:50:11

well it's unusual for me to be locked out of my apartment, with my purse and keys and everything i own still locked inside of my apartment, and both of my phones stolen, and in the hospital on life support for some rare condition when i was the healthiest i'd been in a decade the day before and kicking ass, so i mean i am trying to make sense of things, it all seemed to start when i buried the hatchet with the NSA who i had been fighting with for about 3 years, and offered to help them test some security protocol in exchange for them helping me figure out some issues i've been having with this bio~tech i have implanted in me.
so yeah there is definitely something weird going on, i'm being pulled in directions, microsoft has been very kind at throwing free software at me and wants me to work for them, in spite of me going around saying they're skynet on reddit and various forums, lol (sky[drive].NET, lol)
so i just think that i'm a cyborg and it's like everyone around me is trying to test the waters to see how i'll react, like i'm some kind of experiment or something, because people haven't really known what to expect with a cyborg becoming self aware or something, so i'm not surprised in the least by the "unusual", things aren't making a lot more sense to me than they probably are to anyone who is reading what i just wrote.  
but i'm not actually joking, i'm just trying not to take it too seriously because i literally almost died this week and so i'm somewhat humbled by the fact that i could just as easily not be here in physical form right now.  if this is my reality i might as well try joking about it a bit.

If the gas gauge on my car says I still have gas left, and I'm driving to the gas station fill up but the engine suddenly dies because I'm out of gas, well I guess that's totally my fault.  I shouldn't even bring it up a potential defect to the car manufacturer, because I should just always keep at least 1/4 tank of gas.  So even if the sensor was off a bit, I should be aware that variance is normal and not just blindly trust the system the car manufacturer provides to keep me from running out of gas.  I shouldn't spend any effort whatsoever raising awareness of the idea that the car model in question isn't calibrated correctly, I should just stop giving my tank less gas than it needs to arrive at the destination, and not ever complain about it to anyone.
K, well thanks for enlightening me on your approach.  I'm more of the type who likes to help people adopt better systems, rather than bitch at them for missing something in the fine print. 
Since you love the RTFM approach, why not look into rediquette?  You could just downvote my post here and move on.  Seems like you're the one doing the complaining at this point, I'm just clarifying my point that you seem to have missed.
I guess you took major offense to what I said about how my opinion of bitcoin declines the more of a pain in the ass it is to use to conduct business.  Well that wasn't a personal attack nor was I trying to pick a fight with bitcoin.  I'm a fan of bitcoin and I want it to succeed and live up to its potential.  
If you go to a store and attempt buy something with your debit card that is a penny off, because you or the vendor or Visa or whomever mis~calculated something with the sales tax or it ran up wrong or whatever to where it's a penny off, it usually doesn't just charge you everything you have in your account and then leave you at odds with the merchant trying to figure out what to do about the missing penny.  While it's just a penny and the person behind you in line would probably just pay it for you, that misses the point.  
As someone who has worked with Transactional database design and worked on tons of very large eCommerce systems, it is somewhat eCommerce 101 to have protections in place to prevent this sort of thing.  This just doesn't pass the [ACID test](
On the other hand I do think it's hella cool that multiple parties could pitch in together to pay for an item for someone.  That is something unique I've discovered as a result of this experience.  I also have connected with a lot of cool people here in the community, so to me it was worth it to deal with spending a few hours of my time making sense of this situation.

my opinion of its usefulness as a currency declines the more complicated and annoying it is to actually use it to buy and sell goods and services.  it's not funny, it's annoying, i want to make BTC part of my daily life but until it approaches the level of convenience and stability paypal does, it doesn't seem particularly feasible to get people paying me in bitcoin or convincing them to accept bitcoin as payment.  maybe it's great for redditors who are knee deep in bitcoin forums all day every day, but for those of us who just want to use a better currency it's not really worth the hassle yet.  seems ripe for another cryptocurrency to come along that's a bit more straightforward, but i'm not ready to go shopping around for one yet.

oh okay, well i guess now that it's sync'd i can just try doing it again.  i'm just trying to figure this stuff out, it seems today i'm out of alignment with technology and am struggling to do basic things on the computer so i've been actually focusing on drawing on paper by hand with physical writing instruments, since it seems like way too much hassle to figure out how to buy a wacom tablet with bitcoin and start using inkscape to draw this stuff.  branding and whatnot may seem silly to the outside observer, but to me it is my power source, the center of spiritual energy i need to have in place so i can leverage the spiritual energies that are aligned with my core values...
i just would really like to get my computer cooperating because i have some music ideas i want to work on and right now it's kind of hard when windows is being stupid and keeps ejecting my second hdd with the data files on it, which i've determined is some faulty drm, so now i'm having to move files around and reformat partitions from ntfs to fat32 to figure out how to purge the drm that i don't need bogging down my system for software i'm not even running.

@_date: 2013-12-27 10:44:54


okay that's what I'm going to do from now on. :)


nah, i like Qt.  i'm thinking about using it for my music software development.  i believe in cross~platform development and Qt seems to be the best GUI framework for that right now.  


well there are forces that aren't keen on me doing what i'm doing but with each passing day it seems i am getting a little bit more of my power back, so it's just a matter of time before i'm fully restored again.  nitpicking about a micro bitcoin which ate up too much of my energy today is a lot better than last week when i was in the hospital fighting for my life because a particular organization tried to kill me off.
so i'm not too worried.  it does seem like everything is pretty much on track for the new year's synchronicity and i'm [feeling pretty good]( about everything.
@_date: 2013-12-27 11:00:06
lol i'm not a victim of anything.  i just spent two days trying to place a simple order with coin in one of the wallets i found when i was cleaning out my hard drive backups.  it shouldn't have been that big of a pain to place an order.  since it was, somewhere i was being disrupted, and i'm simply trying to identify specifically where the disruption occurred.  
i really need that tablet so i can do digital drawing art again, and having my hard drive crash, my phone get stolen, and the flash data card on my digital camera inexplicably break, it's clear that some % of the tech i am trying to align with is going on strike, and i'm trying to debug the issue.  it's a problem when i can't seem to get FL studio working so i can make some music, etc.  
tech has always come very intuitive and natural to me, but something disrupted some % of my nano~tech or n~cells or whatever and i was literally in the hospital for several days this month with some kind of life~threatening immune system issue where my body was actually attacking healthy cells.  somewhere there was a communication breakdown.  and IMO one of the areas of concern is having too many decimal places without any kind of comma separators or whatever.  
Please explain to me why you disagree with the notion that xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx is better than xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx for displaying numbers.  Because this kind of notation is ripe for abuse, and the cloud can send subtle signals to people that cause them not to notice little things like this, and this is the kind of stuff that I'm trying to help the NSA identify and fix.  So I'm perfectly fine with being scrutinized as long as it's constructive criticism, but the "you fucked up, sucks to be you" attitude is not really helpful to fixing whatever the problem actually is.
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:57:40

@_date: 2013-12-27 00:34:46
well when i told blockchain to send the payment to gyft why did it send partial payment instead of just not sending a payment at all then?  it should have had enough to cover the fee too, i'm confused, i'm pretty computer savvy and if it seems like i'm banging my head against the wall just to use it to buy stuff, how can i expect less tech savvy friends and family to look at it as more than a novelty?
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:02:40
Nah this is what living in the present feels like; [this is what the future looks like](  I mean, if I'm not the only one feeling that future that is ;)
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:20:45
yeah just somewhere in the process of placing the order there was a rounding error to where it seemed like there was enough in there but really it was off by an mBTC, but rather than rejecting the payment for insufficient funds, it sent it anyway.  
so likely what happened was that between the time that i placed the order thru gyft and the time i actually paid for it via blockchain, the amount required fluxuated just enough to be off by 1 mBTC.
@_date: 2013-12-27 19:48:25
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:00:40
Well it was 0.993, and i had 0.997 in the account, so i thought it was enough to cover the fee, and it went ahead and sent the payment rather than saying it was off by 0.0001; i probably would have been fine if i had waited another half hour because bitcoin has been slowly going up today so i have been watching it to see when the numbers would line up so i could buy that gift card.
@_date: 2013-12-27 09:42:07
*There may have been a minuscule change in exchange rate from when you THOUGHT you knew the amount to send to the time when Bitpay told you the amount.*
I didn't use Bitpay, I used a BlockChain wallet to pay for a Gyft transaction.
The system is flawed because the price should not change between the time you place an order and the time you pay for it.  These things were within seconds of each other.
But what do I know, I mean it's just 1 mBTC.  It's practically worthless, just like 1 BTC used to be.  So why should I care about "the small stuff", you know like if a loan I have goes up by a fractional % and I end up paying a few extra bucks a year on it, no big deal, I should just brush it off like a bedbug bite in the night.
So I guess you're right, it must be my fault, because I wasn't paying enough attention to [the fine print](
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:40:27
hrm so how do i reset the transaction in my local wallet data so i can try sending it again?  since locally it says it was sent.
i don't want the coin missing from my wallet if it was never actually sent anywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:08:12
it popped up some message saying that it didn't have enough to cover the fee and then i closed the window and it had already sent the entire balance of the wallet to the gyft wallet, and then gyft was complaining about it being short by an mBTC
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:51:44
i saw that, thank you :)  i posted a screenshot in reply to your other post, so please let me know if i did it right. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:56:07
yeah but my blockchain wallet had 0.0997 in it, and when i sent the payment then it cleared out the wallet and then gyft was complaining that i was 0.0001 short *shrugs*
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:52:15
I tried this, hopefully it works: 
@_date: 2013-12-27 11:14:38
*sighs* 
i'll replicate the error again later when i go to spend BTC on something, and i'll document how to replicate the problem and post it here.  because the way the fees are set up are clunky.  
it shouldn't have sweeped my account if the total was out of alignment with the balance.  had it simply not sweeped the account it would have been fine, but instead it just reduced the total amount and sent it anyway.  
IMO that is a problem.  so we'll have to agree to disagree, but when it comes time to propose my thoughts on eCurrency this is going to be one of the points that is brought up and will be discussed.
if the current BTC systems don't see it as an issue then new ones will pop up to replace them, the way Electrum is apparently starting to replace Bitcoin~Qt.
