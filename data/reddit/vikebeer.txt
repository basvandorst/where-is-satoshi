Thanks for the quick and informative answer. :)
I don't quite understand how to use confidential transactions on the side chain as of yet (I meant to get into researching it but forgot over a year ago) but I will research more on elements and the liquid sidechain as I didn't even know it was live! Just one more question as far as using liquid, how does the one minute block time effect the security of the transactions?
