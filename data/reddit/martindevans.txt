Very nice chart :)
Is Re-balancing the channels as shown here (I pay you 1 "real BTC", you send me 1 "LN BTC" in return) trustless?

In what way do you add third parties to transactions? I just skimmed the paper, so I could be wrong but as far as I can see if I open a payment channel with you I need to trust no one (including you).

Just from skimming the paper what I've picked up is that Lightning works by locking up a load of bitcoins which creates a "channel" for a group of people to agree on spending amongst themselves. The channel is multisig with the entire group so *everyone* in the channel must agree to any change in ownership. When you create a transaction you share a multisig "settling up" transaction with the group which, if spent, would send the locked bitcoins out to the appropriate accounts (again, everyone in the group must agree to the form of this settling up). The key is that this transaction is *not* broadcast, it's just kept by all members of the group (so there are no on chain transactions contributing to the 7TPS ceiling) and also as soon as you have that transaction you know that if the other party disappears you could just transmit it to the network yourself and unilaterally trigger the settling up phase. Once BTC is locked up in a channel you can only spend it inside that channel until either settling up (triggered by channel members) or timeout (triggered automatically, as  configured during channel creation).
tl;dr: if you want to spend BTC with someone *not* in a channel you need to settle up, which takes as long as a normal BTC transaction.
disclaimer: I only skimmed the paper! Please correct me if I'm wrong!

Maybe six months *is* the multiply by two estimate xD
Personally I always multiply estimates by Pi ;)

Someone else in the [thread mentions something about routes]( and trusted third parties, it sounds like there's a kind of ripple protocol built on top of the lightning payment channels (which are themselves build on top of bitcoin)! I haven't got that far in the paper yet though, so that's just hearsay...
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:50:07
Good point. However, is this only a problem if the *entire* payment channel has a value near the transaction cost? Otherwise the party with more value in the settling up transaction can afford the payment.
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:42:47
Oh don't worry, multiplying by Pi isn't my complete workaround. My process for timetabling is:
1. Make a sensible estimate
2. Multiply by Pi
3. Forget about estimate
4. Refuse to tell anyone
@_date: 2015-12-15 13:34:08
No, because you would need the private key of the missing node to "pick up where they left off". If they disappear you can either broadcast your latest shared transaction (settling up the balance) or wait for the timelock to run out (refunding all initial bitcoins)

Ahhh I had totally missed this in my skim (I'm going to put some time aside to read the full paper in detail tonight).
So channels are built out into something like a trustless ripple network?

A one second glance at my post history confirms that's not true. Whether or not I'm a fake account is also besides the point - you really ought to provide some examples.
@_date: 2014-10-18 15:17:05
I don't pretend to understand exactly how it works, but Satoshi mentioned in the Bitcoin whitepaper about pruning spent transactions: 
I think basically it's throwing away transactions which have been entirely spent, and so are no longer relevant.

Money is to Bitcoin what the web is to a computer - it is simply one of many applications. To the uninformed, bitcoin is just another form of money. The the people who understand computers and technology, it's an "amazing thing".
Seriously, you could make pointless exchanges like this all day - why not give us some examples of the other things out that that we don't understand that make Bitcoin look mundane.

Just send it with no fees. Surely the transaction doesn't actually have to happen, it just needs to get transmitted to the network (where anyone can check it's validity for themselves)?
@_date: 2017-01-16 15:45:43
Yep that's true

Maybe  and

I've seen lots of people implying it's some kind of technological limit recently, but it seems like [it's not](
