If this happens I'm buying the following stocks: $TSLA, $SCTY, $DWTI and $TVIX and more bitcoins.

Why did you delete your comment then? I studied Japanese history, studied the language, and have lived there for a few years. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:04:54
This isn't ignorant or racist at all...
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:14:01
Thats because of the salaryman culture. Men stayed at work too long and were not present to be a strong male role model. Japanese were not violent, they just put emphasis on social norms so they basically do what everyone else does and what they are told. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:24:11
I doubt thats what all they know. The past does echo into the present but not completely. There is a lot of cultural cross pollination with modern media, the internet, etc.

Even "real" investors laugh at Cramer...

I'm definitely selling at 10-11k+ and buy back if it goes down if that was the case,
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:14:48
Well, that was my strategy when it $1000+ and I held... like a bag holding bitch. I have learned from my lesson. When hype is high dont buy. When hype is low buy. 
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:36:29
If bitcoin stays at this price (adjusted for inflation of USD) then yeah. But given its volatile history... maybe not.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:53:12
So same odds as Trump winning the election?
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:34:52
I think all of those make it easier to track income unless you have a very sophisticated obfuscation system. The typical person who would most likely use a handful of wallets would be more easily tracked with bitcoin.
Sometimes you want a credible trackable wallet to build credit/credibility. Just sayin...

this gives me mixed emotions

@_date: 2016-06-12 00:28:46
This is great and all but WTF happened? 
@_date: 2016-06-12 02:43:45
I would prefer if the price wasn't so dependent on one factor.
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:02:09
Which fiat. There are a lot of forks in fiat.
@_date: 2016-06-23 12:05:39
you are probably right.

i hope to sell my jalapeño someday as an antique
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:58:29
Only if it were that easy to call top and "new" bottom. I've lost money trying to do that in the stock market. I've learned my lesson
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:45:15
It hit $20 during the presale so DAO contributed
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:59:43
Time to swing trade
@_date: 2016-06-12 01:37:16
lets hope this time it sticks
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:55:56
1. Probably has to do with Garzik and segwit2x
2. BCash has no segwit and has a larger block size
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:16:04
Don't need to be tech literate. Applications will pop up and it will become a service. Bitcoin will make financial forensics / forensic accounting much more interesting.

The FED and the FEDs have a delicate equilibrium. While change is good, it can also be destabilizing and painful (for some).
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:11:07
the plot... thickens?!
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:14:21
Bought several movie tickets @ $450, basically the opposite of your situation
@_date: 2016-06-25 04:25:01
Isn't that a double bottom?
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:27:17
That all depends on how you paid.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:59:40
A lot of posts are like this for me. Was in BTC since 2013. Was using a different username at the time though 
@_date: 2016-12-18 03:09:53
Dollar is getting stronger though because of rate hike. Here's hoping though

probably better related to this:

I haven't heard that before...
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:37:29
the patent system is a relatively new concept and throughout human history, innovation has done fine without it. You may say that the patent system has contributed to the recent advancements but that is a false assertion since the internet is a major example against it and lots of the innovations that exist now are the products of either war and / or built on ideas from the past.

Has Anyone Really Been Far Even as Decided to Use Even Go Want to do Look More Like?
@_date: 2016-09-27 03:18:56
because bitcoin is not the only tech that uses blockchain?
@_date: 2018-03-04 01:22:46
Oh, you mean like the internet?
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:04:15
They probably don't even know...
@_date: 2015-09-22 13:55:28
What affect would it have on bitcoin if they do decide to file a patent and they get it?
@_date: 2015-09-29 20:43:11
Which is missed by this whole sub.
Great thing about bitcoin as a currency is that there is no central control of supply. Its no secret where its coming from. It still has no intrinsic value.
Fiat has no intrinsic value either but supply is centrally controlled and is not fully understood or accounted for.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:50:36
PoS has so many meanings. Which do you mean? Proof of Stake? Piece of Shit? Point of Sale?
I got some eth about a year ago in the presale. Kind of disappointed in the current plunge. Although, I am still up from my previous BTC investment.
@_date: 2015-09-30 18:44:05
you should place any changes in quotes within brackets. And make the appropriate marks on revisions.
"all forms of ~~value~~ [~~fiat~~ currecncy] are merely virtual"
@_date: 2015-09-29 21:08:25
Well I am speaking more about the supply of bitcoins and transactions being visible. Whatever they do in terms of bitcoin can be seen. Its hard to cheat in terms of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-30 12:55:14
I believe he was selling bitcoin off chain. Basically selling bitcoin he didnt have.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:47:43


Curious, whats the purpose of it then?
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:40:20
Your statement added nothing to what he/she said.
@_date: 2015-09-30 21:31:44
spelling is not my strong point, username has a double meaning.
@_date: 2015-09-22 17:38:06
Would it be an issue to anything in play now? Any products or services that have prior art wouldn't be affected? As long as it is proven of course... GIT repos, publications, etc.
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:41:03
Whats missing: A TLDR and a bitcoin campaign contribution.
@_date: 2015-09-29 20:54:14
Well, for now. At the same time we see everything they do. Unlike closed door central banks.

USD is not the sole reserve currency. Yuan was just made a reserve currency recently. GBP, Euro, etc are also reserve currencies

typo in the bottom $42?
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:28:48
I want another sell off so I can average down my panic buy at 420. All I said was let me think this through and buy after lunch and BAM 420! Got caught in the bull trap.
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:24:36
whats the context?
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:49:14
But its mostly China driving the price... same reason it went down last time.
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:53:29
God Damnit... SHHH. It will hear you.
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:54:47
Back again...

yes. single point of success  = single point of failure. funny how I got downvoted earlier. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:09:31
3 bubbles here too... totally fucked my cost averagimg mostly because of panic buys.
