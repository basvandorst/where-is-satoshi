If your argument is that giving people $1k/mo will cause them to stop working then it's a bad argument. 
Carousel fraud is... fraud and illegal. I'm sure the people responsible for the VAT implementation are aware and will plan accordingly. 
Your country's situation is not really relevant. Small and mid-size businesses will most certainly benefit from the increase in consumer spending power.

Its very obvious that you haven't looked into Yang at all. He is not fear mongering and he's not trying to stop automation. If you just do 5 minutes of research you can easily find how he's planning to pay for it. Do that before you comment.

There's also a carbon tax ($40/ton), financial transaction tax, current welfare spending, savings from reductions in incarceration/homelessness/emergency/healthcare spending and increased revenue as a result of the UBI (increased consumer spending). Again, 5 minutes of research.

Truly baffling how progressives are anti-Yang because he wants to "gut the welfare system" and libertarians are anti-Yang because he wants to "expand the welfare system".

And that's fine. You could just say that instead of painting him as a Luddite or doubting the math behind his plan.
