Can you sell BTC there? Does it then spit out Euros? 
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:45:37

Real sale? Was it someone you knew who made the purchase or was it a stranger? 
@_date: 2016-03-12 01:17:04
LOL, it's like a crime now to have privacy :(

1984 such a long time ago, or is it? 
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:18:06
I kick myself everyday. But I might do the same if a coin is a million and it's few hundred today :(

Yes, but no income tax, they got that part right! I didn't like the slavery or no woman voting but I like the freedom they had if they where white males they just had to give that to everyone. The concept was good in general now we have abandoned all that was good.

I heard someone once say don't worry about them looking at your phones and computers if you have nothing to hide (I might have heard it a few times over the years). Makes me sad :(

I wish I bought some bitcoin when it was a penny I had a chance but I blew it :(
@_date: 2016-03-02 23:24:42
No, should I? And if so, which? 
@_date: 2016-03-06 13:50:06
I don't know if that is true, it's been pretty resilient community over the years. Also the idea is out there, if bitcoin is dead, their will be a much better one to take it's place I think.

You just need that software they have then there is a button on the upper right it's not 100% clear but somewhere is a way to look at listings. Maybe someone should make a step by step guide since I'm stumbling with it myself. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 20:55:56
So what is the solution to this problem? Or is it a problem? 
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:26:36
I think more and more people would give their freedom and privacy in the name of "security". I hope that is not true but that's is what I'm sensing. 
@_date: 2016-03-12 15:27:14
I was being sarcastic :)

Of the 3 ways the local meetups looks like the best. But what if you are loving in an area with no meetup? 
@_date: 2016-03-02 03:31:49
Any instructions how to get started? 
@_date: 2016-03-12 15:07:08
Wasn't the original dollar deflationary since it was tied to silver and the rate of getting more silver vs. the rate of the growth of the economy was a bit smaller? I always thought the prices going down was good for us, but everyone tells me that is horrible that prices going up is good. What do you think is true and good for regular working people like me who are not rich?

Do the "educated respected people in power" agree with your statement?

I'm starting to learn and promise to be a good comrade :)

Not in American 150 years ago. Google it. It's a crime to extort people of their property they work for it's against the American bill of rights principles. If I can do that to you then you can't be free. That is the hold point of liberty! If you can force me to take my income then I'm not free I'm under your tyranny. I pay taxes because I'm forced by people with guns who will put me in jail if I don't give them half of my income, but that is not what real American use to once, they capt all their income (there was no income police or income jail, people use to be free). I'm not. That is what make me sad, I'm force to work and give it to others.

The power to tax is the power to destroy is what real Americans once believed. In fact in most history American's didn't have someone take their money. I guess what I find it weird is they think they are entitled to their money. So if they are trying to not pay it's not cheating they premise is wrong I think if you are a real American who believes in freedom is there is a such a thing any more. I know more and more American's think it's ok to take a quarter of your money and those who are trying to pay less are cheats. Who knows maybe one day they will take half of their money and ban bitcoin.

good, I'm relaxing now :)

@_date: 2017-05-15 14:07:20
I wonder how are they going to be able to spend the money without getting cought? 
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:31:16
Are you saying I did this? 
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:43:56
If that does happen the price of Bitcoin will double overnight. That I'm certain of. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:11:01
50K is enough if they are from some cheap place or not much if they from New York. So ti's all relative. The bigger problem is if they get ought it's not going to be nice for them!
