This is ~~sarcasim?  Sarckisim? Srcasm?~~ you exaggerating?  
It would be an interesting statistic to see somehow the percentage of coins purchased on a site and the percentage that stays for &gt; x Days post purchase.  Like a Residing Ratio or the Trust Ratio.   I have no way of knowing but Ill throw out there that it is 40% that stays with the top 10 global brokerages?  The rest are put into hardware or paper.  The other determining variable would be some tier as to perception of value - namely if it has more value, it has a higher ratio of being held farther away and colder from the brokerage.

Coinbase/GDAX is a regulated and licensed broker in the State of New York USA and is a KYC (Know your Client) organization.  This is just like any brokerage in the US that follows State/US regulations.  This means that for Coinbase, they will ask you for your Identification and to verify you are who you say you are.  If they cannot, they will not approve you.  If they do validate your information, they may ask you for more info to participate on GDAX. I'm guessing that you signed up with limited personal information provided.  
 The steps are as an individual:  1.) Sign up for a Coinbase account with the expanded information that they ask.  You have to provide them what is called KYC (google it) 2. Once approved, go to GDAX and log on.  If they require more validation for this step, you will see the new steps in approval.  
Here is the IRS (Internal Revenue Service of the US) info on countries that cooperate in KYC

Coinbase makes this a mystery and dont seem to want to clearly make this information known.  Nice work.

The GDP of 2017 for the Netherlands was $ 840 BN USD. The global GDP in 2017 was about $79 Trillion with a T.   Modern floralculture sales is about 5% of Dutch GDP or about $40 BN USD. Figure Tulip bulbs are half that?  $20.5 Bn? (I have no idea)   If that ratio or % of GDP for the Netherlands was the same in the 1600 when this Tulip craze happened, it would be in the news in Holland but laughed at as being minuscule on a global scale.  Cryptocurrency does not compare at $200 BN to $79 Trillion global GDP or easily 4x the size on a completely different scale of potential growth.    Who was the first college professor that wanted to make a case about some crazy run up in volatility, and looked for an explanation, and could only find this example?   He/she could have used something that represents a much bigger scale for a speculative example?  Like Gold?  Land values?  Spices(think Marco Polo)?  Jewels?  All of these would show speculation and volatility as a natural course of event in a new asset class.

As a followup, Gemini contacted me after numerous other emails and offers of free beer if they just reply.  They apologized for the delay.  In my case, my account was set up in a trust, and even though the account names matched, they didn't like the trust.  The issue with them is still the same that they were unable to provide any feedback as to what happened to the wire for more than 14 days.  Yet, here I am going to open up a non-trust checking account and then try it again.  The good news is that my worst thoughts about them were not true.  The bad news is it is close to impossible to communicate with them in a two way dialogue.  They are just overwhelmed it appears and don't have the will or the capacity to improve on it?  I challenge anyone to call the CS number and try to talk to anyone.  It will just go to a voice mail where they will never never call you back.

Steve, I have called their CS 5 times in the past 5 days.  Each time, they dont even let the phone ring, it goes directly to a recording and you leave a message and then ....  No response.  I dont know what number you are calling if you have a magic number that gets through to a live person?  And this written complaint form?  Where is this?  What is it?

Self,  June 28th today
I wired on 6/15 my money after setting up all the steps for an account.  It came from a joint checking account with my wife.  I received a note saying that the name didn't exactly match the Gemini account.  I sent a note back asking what the next step should be.    Then it all began.  I have 18 telephone, email, twitter outgoing to them with ZERO response from them.  So far its day 15 where they have my money at Silvergate Bank (their bank) and they accepted my money.  But they just send notes back thanking me for the contact and it will take up to 24 hours to get back with me.    They definitely have a broken process and I would not say it yet borders on Fraud but you can imagine what I am thinking.  They are governed by the State of New York and I will pursue that route next if I get no response.
