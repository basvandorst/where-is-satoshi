Hey, i'm not op.. but who is Nick and Rusty? 
I already follow the other guys.. I'm trying to get more positive source of btc knowledge...

Yeah, but since BitConnect can't even keep the title they already had, it makes me think BitConnect sucks. I haven't done any research on it, but that's what my gut says.

I'm amused that BCC is used so widely to discuss Jihan's hypothetical coin and yet, Bitconnect was BCC first.

Are we gonna see Bitcoin/Bitcoin Classic like with Ethereum?

When you say "BCC" do you mean BitConnect?

Can someone tell me if I have prefork Bitcoins, can I deposit them in Bittrex and sell my BCH balance?

I do... 1 btc's value is no less than 1 million usd.
Won't sell til 1 million.
MAYBE I'll sell you one for 975k, that's my offer.

We may not be wizards but i bet we'll meme it to 1 million dollars.

Is your plan to transfer coins from hardware wallet to GDAX and HitBTC and sell them right away?
Curious how I can replicate this. I also want to kill B2X...
