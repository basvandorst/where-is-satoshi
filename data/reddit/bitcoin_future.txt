Depends on how big the user base gets doesn't it? The blockchain is already too big for most users to download.

Oh, I see it now. That's something I need to work on :)


I was working on the assumption that the blockchain requires infinite growth to work. Could this cause problems with storage/costs in the long term (or even short term if the user base grows) and force storage of the blockchain to be centralised?
Would this cause the amount of data usage to process transactions to grow infinitely, causing mining costs to rise?
I would think the cost of network infrastructure would become unsustainable long before Bitcoin tx volume got anywhere near credit card tx volume. Does the Bitcoin network require increased computational power to increase the amount of transactions/users, how is this sustainable?

I think you'be got that backwards, "Bitcoin could hypothetically solve a lot of real world problems if the problems with Bitcoin are solved." Would be more accurate.
Asking questions is how we learn and find problems...

I was just questioning whether or not it is scalable, did you even read my posts?

Bitcoin does require infinite growth to operate, whether the required rate of growth is sustainable will determine its long term viability.
As computing power becomes cheaper it might become cheaper to process Bitcoin per transaction (maybe? It only seems to be getting more expensive), but the cost of maintaining the Bitcoin network could become unsustainable as it grows.


Bitcoin is already becoming more centralised due to computing and electricity costs and the size of the network. Even if mining costs were reduced to the point that you could mine at home again the size of the network requires centralised mining.


Mining has to remain profitable, higher difficulty + less btc per block + rising costs + centralisation= higher fees.

We all know Bitcoin works fine at a small scale that's not what this is about.

Thanks, I'll have to read up on that.

The blockchain requires infinite growth to continue operating, in the long term this could be problematic. We also have a finite amount of energy and hardware, if Bitcoin was widely adopted this could be a problem.

Thanks, is bitcointalk.org any good?
