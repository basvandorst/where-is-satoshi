The ECB report is a 55 page document about virtual currencies.. while it does discuss virtual currencies in general it's almost entirely about bitcoin. A number of bitcoin commentators seem to have jumped to the conclusion that the ECB report is bad news.. I wonder if they've actually read the whole thing? The report wouldn't have been written if they thought bitcoin were going to be just a flash in the pan.. overall the document seems IMO largely supportive of bitcoin.
Even the paragraph quoted by this commentator isn't really that threatening.. it actually says 'further action from OTHER authorities can reasonably be expected in the near future' -- in other words, not further action from the CIA (beyond interviewing gavin) or possibly even any other agency of the US government.. they might be anticipating action from say.. the Argentine government to stop people getting around their capital controls.. or China or whatever.
The finish central bank has already declared bitcoin legal in Finland so no prosecutions are going to be happening there. Frankly by not prosecuting anyone so far in 4 years while heavily publicizing bitcoin in the press, I think we basically have implicit permission to trade bitcoins. Sure people may get in trouble for doing things with bitcoins that are illegal anyway (ie, drugs) but I really don't think we're going to get arrested for money laundering (unless perhaps you actually are directly money laundering using bitcoins).
There has been a big push by regulators over the last few years trying to get e-money initiatives going around the world.. bitcoin is what they've been trying to create - it isn't going to be shut down by the authorities.. maybe exchanges will become more heavily regulated but that's probably about the worst that will happen.. and that might not be entirely bad either.. lets face it we've seen some badly run bitcoin exchanges.
