Use viabtc, I did this yesterday and within 30 minutes I had unstuck a tx that wasn’t likely to move until the mempool halved 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:42:52
No one knows the answer to the question you’re asking.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:47:25
Take your profits and run, you said it yourself that it’s changing your life 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:13:15
Refresh / search google . Happened a few times to me as well
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:25:47
IF anyone can assist I would appreciate it for a single tx

If you have access to a Windows machine, try the following (without typing quotes):
1. Click start button, search for cmd.exe and open it
2. type “CD \” and hit enter 
3. type “dir /s /b | findstr /i wallet.dat”
4. review the results and see what comes up

No issues withdrawing from QuadrigaCX, less than 4 days 
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:49:17
Yes - they exchange you for Quadriga bucks. When you transfer to your wallet you are sent the coin
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:45:46
Also consider that BTC and BCH often mimic one another, so a loss in one will be multiplied. ETH seems to be standing out on it’s own currently, might be worth taking into consideration. If you have the ability to diversify further to include some ALT’s, I would expect that to be a conservative strategy 
@_date: 2018-01-02 07:01:39
You’re suggesting that viewing tx history is a negative thing, no?
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:12:11
What’s the maximum amount of time that a payment channel can remain open? If it’s indefinite, what stops large corporations or vendors from establishing large payment channels and never posting to the blockchain - there’s now less incentive for miners to use electricity? 
Am I the only one who prefers the public nature of btc? Other discreet tokens are available if you seek anonymity.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:50:47
What fee was used?
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:26:57
What a dream
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:26:26
So the option to use either method will be available once implemented? Is the idea that your wallet will provide a button to toggle this functionality once implemented
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:40:24
This worked for me, thank you 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:28:21
I have some stuck as well...3 days now at 121 sat/B
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:14:48
Fiat drops in value year after year, yet everyone uses it
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:13:16
Okay, that’s fine for now - but they will essentially be plagued with the same technical challenges as they increase in popularity and usage. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:52:37
Or you just use new public addresses per tx
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:01:58
I don’t like waiting for a confirmation, but this is what keeps the chain transparent. If a public address is never associated with my identity, the transaction is essentially anonymous
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:52:23
Wait for a period when the mempool isn’t backed up (weekends are often cheaper)
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:58:48
Fee is low - I can’t speculate how long it will take to clear as even higher fee tx are not moving at the moment. Seems there’s a bit of spam occurring at the moment 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:42:45
Keep trying, loaded for me today 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:39:56

On blockchain.info will you be able to restore to gain access to fork coins?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:00:49
At a market cap of 1 trillion, that’s approx $60,000 per coin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:51:19
1) Price rises 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:43
Not even phased - just bought on the way down 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:58:04
So bitaddress paper wallets earn all the forks?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:53:11
As long as you have access to the wallet currently you can, and should, move it to a new wallet where you know the seed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:30:23
It’s many years ago now, I don’t even recall seeing private keys otherwise I would have recorded it. Have a PIN number, would the wallet be stored in a file on the device somewhere?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:34:24
One wild private key
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:35:37
I don’t recall there being one back then, just a pin?

@_date: 2017-12-10 05:03:00
It’s technically not free money, you could have cashed out to dollars in your hand. If it makes you feel better thinking that way, that’s one thing, but it’s definitely not free money. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:14:30
If you hold your btc in a bitaddress paper wallet, will you be able to receive all of the forks?
What about breadwallet, blockchain, electrum, etc?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:46:27
Could always forward a small piece to me :) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:23:27
Nothing. Look up arbitrage, this happens every day

Make sure you have access to the mobile app as a potential second method to login

Check menu / settings /advanced / withdraw btc - I haven’t done this but I know it’s an option

Anticipation for the feds next move
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:58:00
Under the dashboard you select withdraw and follow the prompts 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:26:51
Enjoy it! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:40:15
One thing people are missing here is the fact that your profit margin right now is massive, which inherently reduces your risk by allowing you additional time to liquidate on the way down. To sell and pull profit is nice,  but playing with “house money” is really just money you choose to leave in the game. If you liquidate half now you won’t earn as quickly, and if FOMO kicks in on the way up you will have lost your original buy-in position - even with the liquidated profit re-invested. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:20:32
Should have made enough from Saturday to keep you going for a week :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:32:12
How many coins? And they all exist on a single wallet? 
Your point is valid, I would worry about getting paid out if it’s an extremely large amount. 
I would imagine if you act quickly (and safely), you can withdraw x amount now, and x amount in January, to save some taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:36
Bull run up till the next launch and start shorting 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:29:58
Great documentary - it’s a high level overview that paints cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in a positive light. Not too heavy or technical 
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:55:02
For the record, I’ll PM you a suggestion that might help!!
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:55:32
Show proof
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:01:23
I didn’t see BTC tipping, but you can tip BCH
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:43:59
Mainstream media don’t hold any BTC, yet. There will always be followers, and even if a bust is on the horizon, crypto isn’t going away - this is an emerging marketing that lives alongside fiat markets and will be traded by people all over the world. The younger generation will eat this stuff up by the second, they don’t want to touch fiat cash, everything is Apple / Android pay and e transfers - crypto (in many forms) will be an extension of their daily activities going forward
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:28:17
First of all, congrats. Second, that’s an interesting scenario to be in...I would drive myself nuts thinking of the best way to diversify my holdings to ensure my gains aren’t lost. Might cause weaker earnings going forward, but you’ve come so far 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:58:21
How many have withdrawn to CAD from QuadrigaCX? Smooth process, no hiccups, or delays?
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:09:44
Pretty sure you have to send the BCH to an exchange where you can convert it to BTC, then send it to your BTC wallet of choosing 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:30:40
Does anyone have more information on the password encrypted paper wallets? When one is created, whose to say another person doesn’t generate the same key? The password itself seems like it’s used to generate the wallet, and not an arbitrary password used to unlock the wallet - is that correct? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:01:35
It means traditional bankers are going to shit their pants when crypto is adopted by the masses - you’ll see a massive push to convert fiat currency to crypto to prevent a total loss of value
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:43:27
Congrats! You left far ahead of where you started, and in that I see no negatives. It could go to the moon tomorrow and you still made a gain that has a significant impact on your life. Enjoy!
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:46:51
The wallets that you’re referring to are considered hot wallets, where the service provider controls the private key.   You have to trust that the service provider is following best practices when it comes to security. If the service provider is hacked, your wallet/crypto currency could be compromised and stolen from you. 
Hot wallet providers are (more frequently than not) a much larger target to be hacked, therefore you have the option to create an offline/paper wallet/cold wallet that you have complete control over. So long as you create and store this securely, no one else should have the private key, which is what enables you to send your funds elsewhere.
Also, the benefit (and sometimes detriment) to a paper wallet is that you control the private key. Non-technical users may not understand how to create, store, and transact with with this type of wallet securely, therefore exposing their wallets private key and the possibility of being compromised. 
You can also purchase dedicated hardware to store crypto currency with easy to use functionality, and built-in recovery features. Alternatively, you can use a computer that you already own/specifically configure and run software that allows you store your crypto, but again, this can be risky in terms of security. 
The way that you would find out if one wallet provider is “more secure” than another is to review the offerings of each and compare. The term “more secure” is misleading, though, as even the best can be compromised no matter how good “their” practice is.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:49:18
Might help if you mention which exchange you’re using? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:08:33
Thanks for the generosity, as that’s more BTC than I have ever owned :) 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:35:23
Net worth over a mil? Sounds like you’re a half empty type of a guy...
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:59:12
Sweeping your funds from paper to a hot wallet exposes your private key during import. If a key logger was running at the time someone could steal it 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:35:15
If you have the ID and private key pair I don't see why not, but the hardware wallet would have to provide that information to you. 
You should be more concerned with retaining the recovery phrase of the hardware wallet as a "backup" to the "backup" in my opinion (no expert) 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:28:52
Congrats 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:48:25
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:06:51
Which wallet did you use
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:14:49
If you ever sweep funds from that paper wallet I would generate a new one
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:39:52
What’s up fam!
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:25:19
Would be nice if transactions didn’t fail because these atm’s don’t spit your money back out

What’s the verification process like?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:04:43
The issue for consumers is that the fees are astronomical
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:37:14
Start with .5 BTC, or .25 BTC, as an initial goal? Looking back I should have went all in at the beginning, it would have been cheaper to just buy 1 BTC and eliminate fees. I look at previous transactions and do the calculations, it’s enough to make you want to cry
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:50:43
Am I missing something here, or have you simply swept a wallet using the private key and password that was provided to you (into a BTC/BCH wallet), then transferred the BCH to another BCH wallet?
Also, it should be said that since the private key for that wallet is publicly available it should never be used for any secure transactions going forward.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:56:46
Diversify immediately
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:17:12
Was it for the exact amount you were attempting to purchase? Speak to the owner about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:51:41
I’m struggling to determine if a hardware wallet is really worth the investment, or if paper wallets will do...
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:20:58
Why do you want to sell?
