Just coming back to life to point out 7 months ago Coinbase's legal team strong-armed a few mods here and in other crypto subs to have me banned.  Because my *reddit handle* contained the word Coinbase.  Guess who also owns [the trademark on Coinbase](
Yep, don't trust Coinbase with these patents further than you trust your private keys with them.  I did and now this handle is forced to apply the following disclaimer in most posts to digital currency subs.

Never forget what happened to me.  I was temporarily banned from and other crypto-subs because Coinbase has a trademark on Coinbase and elected to flex their muscle on *usernames* of people who supported Coinbase.
My name is Craig and I use Coinbase.

The problem is POS systems made by NCR, IBM, Square, whoever have not been designed to include qr codes/bitcoin settlements.  The trivial solution is to create your own POS system which manages bitcoin, plastic, and cash.
Want to make a POS system with me?  I have the spare time and development environment to make it possible...

No, my pay is pegged to USD.  A few months ago it was 0.06 BTC.  I am hoping the price goes back up so I can stop draining my wallet, but I'm really kicking myself for accepting payment in BTC.  I got paid during the recent spike to 300 which immediately fell to ~$250.  I wasn't around to move my money into an exchange and essentially lost a few hundred dollars.  
Never accept your paycheck in BTC.

That is a great point!  We must remember that Bitcoin and TCP/IP are specifications.  There is nothing to tax until you implement it. 
Usage of bitcoin and TCP/IP have taxes factored into their costs (e.g. you need to use TCP/IP to use your comcast cable modem, you are taxed for your cable modem service, ergo you are taxed for *using* TCP/IP)

I just setup Squid on my home router to block all pixel tracking, advertisements and other methods of advertisers (read google, facebook, reddit, and twitter) from tracking my movements around the web.  It's really nice to browse the web without seeing ads for a search I performed a month ago, or for things *I already purchased*.  I took it a step further and gave up my Visa card for a Coinbase account so my purchasing habits can't be linked either.

Linux is a kernel, first and foremost.  Ubuntu/Linux is a Linux distribution.  Android/Linux is also a Linux distribution customized with Google's sandbox VM and graphics system (davlik) as well as a boatload of custom libraries instead of relying on existing VM's (Java) or graphics systems (Xorg/Wayland).  Sometime in the past decade we dropped the /Linux nomenclature and just started calling systems by their distribution eg Ubuntu, Android, Fedora, etc.
The only thing that is the same between Android Linux and Ubuntu Linux is the kernel and bits of the userland (cp, df, etc).  You could fully implement Android Linux userland under any Linux kernel and Debian/Ubuntu's userland on any Linux kernel (including one's built for Android).

I understand.
Do you understand where I am coming from?  Coinbase, the company which we tout as one of the best things to happen to Bitcoin is attempting to force *users on reddit* (their support base) to not use the name they themselves took from bitcoin?  
I mean I closed my bank account to use Coinbase as my sole online purchasing processor and they thank me by getting me banned from several subs.  I was unbanned here obviously because I did nothing wrong, therefore I'm keeping my name until my secondary username is past the "probationary period" where you have to wait 20 minutes between posts.

Apparently, people named craig who *use* coinbase are confused with people named Craig who *work at* coinbase.  I was banned from several cryptocurrency and bitcoin subs because Coinbase decided they wanted to control anyone with the word Coinbase in their username.  Nevermind that I have been posting around here for over a year without any complaints.  Anyway, the mods and I worked out a deal and now I get to have a disclaimer on all of my top level points in I still get downvoted because people think i'm impersonating Ridiculous? Yes.  Alas, it is the life we live in.

I just want to point out, his apology did not end it.  I am still downvoted just because of my username.  Also now I must post a disclaimer which causes further downvotes.  I'm glad you don't have that stigma associated with your username, Michael @ Coinbase (or are you just Michael that uses Coinbase).
TL;DR: Sorry it doesn't end because you say it ends, I am still affected and bitter that I have to change my username because of it.

Banks have already started mining your purchase history and shares them with retailers who pay the right amount!  If that isn't a better excuse to start switching to Bitcoin, I don't know what is.  My story, revolves around something similar.  A bank took money from me, when I confronted them they said that's policy.  So I have since shutdown my bank account and use Coinbase for sending payments from my bitstash.

Hi that was me, I guess that makes my username illegal right?  I mean nevermind the fact that the actual employee and I posted in this sub for over a year and never crossed paths.  Suddenly Coinbase says I was impersonating him (when I clearly state in all of my posts I am not a Coinbase employee) and gets me banned.  Coinbase.

Android has glibc.  Android can run linux apps.  You just need all the necessary libraries.  The precursor to this phone was Debian/Ubuntu cross compiled for ARMv9, or in other words all of ubuntu's and debian's userland recompiled for ARM and the Android Linux kernel.  NDK (android's performance sdk) is an elaborate wrapper around a c/c++ compiler..  Further Android "apps" are actually butchered java jar files (Google tweaked the java implementation just enough to avoid infringements).  Android's userland (/bin/cp, /bin/df, glibc etc.) can be cross compiled to any platform.  x86 android can run native x86 linux binaries from the android console.

It's stupid but Coinbase has the weight to throw around to make it happen.  I have since stopped using Coinbase, but I'm just one peon in the bitcoin ecosystem that means nothing.  Ergo, disclaimer.

just hijacking this thread to point out one of the pivotal problems I see with BTC.  I mentioned this before, but the concept of "hidden fees" will be a consumer killer.  The transaction fee is well understood by purveyors of the technology, but it is not understood to outsiders.  And people who follow bitcoin because "it enables you to be your own bank" or "cheaper money transmitter fees" still don't gather that a transaction fee of up to $0.04 is required.  We all can agree 4 cents is not a lot, but you have to realize the psychological impression it leaves (please see all reviews about plastic bag bans, it happened here and losing $0.05 for even one bag makes you rage at Whole Foods, even though it's not their fault -- but merchant plastic bag usage has dropped by over 70%, see the correlation here?).  Bitcoin takes 4 cents from you up front, USD you lose 4 cents over time but since it is incorporated into all of your bills you don't notice it.  I also understand that transaction fees are a necessary evil to continue providing incentive to miners.  This leaves us between a rock and a hard place with the only solution being to tell anyone that is interested in bitcoin about possible
* transaction fees
* conversion fees
* and in some cases, merchant fees!
That is all.

Hi, he makes a very good point.  His scenario is much more likely, as even a 13 year old kid could do it and make out like a bandit before he/she is caught.  Look at the ATM counterfeit rings and imagine a widespread rash of counterfeit QR codes.  Definitely more likely compared to someone walking in with a machine gun.
No, a more practical solution would be a QR code that is behind the counter and controlled by the cash register.  This also has it's share of problems.. but imagine something where the cashier is working on a touch screen, hits a QR button and then swivels the entire kiosk to face the user to scan.  This allows the merchant to keep control of the transaction rather than pointing at a static image that could change without anyone noticing for days or weeks.

Why should I be the one to change my username because a company decided to throw their weight around after they themselves stole the name from the bitcoin protocol specs!  I feel like I'm being slighted just like when I go to a bank and they tell me they stole $30 from my account for a fee that I don't deserve.  So I came to bitcoin and started supporting bitcoin and took a name that reflects myself, the software and the service company that I use.  Now I'm being told to just get a new username.  
It kinda makes me wonder what will happen when bitcoin becomes mainstream.  Coinbase will be the new Bank of America.  Using their might and colossal coinstash to push little people like you and me around?  
TL;DR: I'll roll over and just get a new username.

The person we want to go after is and Coinbase's PR dept.  That user went around all of my posts saying I was impersonating him (mind you I was talking about things like bitcoin price fluctuations in bitcoinmarkets, or commenting on fucking linux kernels here in bitcoin).  We both posted to this sub for a year, and we never crossed paths.  
His spamming caused a knee-jerk reaction by the mods, welp this guy (me) is getting reported more than the other guy.  he must not really work for coinbase and really is impersonating.  was the first to realize the mistake, after pointing this out to they realized they were in the wrong too.  i'm still banned in and The point is, now to avoid giving mods undue work, I have to add a disclaimer because someone at coinbase decided to screw over anyone with coinbase in their username.  This is entirely a fault of Coinbase, as they "provide support" on social media.  They obviously need a better PR and Marketing team.  But until then, everyone sees Coinbase as doing no evil.  This is only the first step.  How many coins do they hold?  
Bitcoin is doomed because of this, not because of a few mods doing their job.

My concern is just like any business, if the majority of your market share leaves, you are left a sinking ship.  Business likes profit, business hates loss.  The rise was great, but the continual sinking means losses are being realized somewhere.  To avoid the continued losses, I would not be surprised if another coin stepped up to the plate

I wouldn't say it is necessarily about beating classical computers, at first.  But rather supplementing them.  You use it to reduce the possible combinations of a given function.  From there, conventional computing has a much higher probability of finding the solution.  Eg. brute-forcing hundreds of millions of combinations rather than hundreds of trillions or more.
However, I never once said bitcoin would be affected by quantum computing in the near future.  If I did, my startup would already be dead (and not dead)

I'm sorry, I know you are being facetious, but there are many countries which ban or charge a ridiculous tax on bitcoin (usa being one of them).  SO yes, there are actually transcontinental fees as well.  Then there are also conversion fees.  Just sticking to America, you will face a premium using localbitcoins, Circle, or even Coinbase.  If you are not upfront about it, it will be a hidden fee for the end user and they may hold a negative viewpoint afterwards and insist upon Paypal or direct wire transfer.

This is assuming the freelance designer will spend the bitcoin at retailers which accept them.  This will not help them if they have purchase orders due or employees expecting payment in USD or any other fiat currency, and thus the conversion will cost them money.  Same with localbitcoins, Circle, and Coinbase.  You should really be upfront and tell them of all the fees that they may be impacted by, especially if they are located in a foreign country.
Bottom line, if they are just going to take the btc and convert to fiat, why not just save the fees across the board and pay in fiat directly?

This guy is talking nonsense.  You can short most any stocks or etfs or even mutual funds!  The thing is you need a broker with enough volume that can handle shorts.  Think or swim (td ameritrade) is generally the standard and they can short everything except OTC shares.  Even though td ameritrade is a large platform, there are still etfs that are thinly traded, so you couldn't short if you wanted too.
That said, I'm sure COIN will have enough attention that you can get involved in shorts after it's initial offering.
