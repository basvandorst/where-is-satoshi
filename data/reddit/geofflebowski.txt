Mycelium.  
It asks me to create a 12 word back up. 
I do that.   
Now it says I have 4 private keys.  
Then I create another HD wallet.  
This one only has 2 private keys.  
Should I create another backup for the new HD wallet?

Probably more like 1992. Give it a decade or two.

Agreed, bitcoin is very speculative. However, practical application of bitcoin and the blockchain are rapidly being discussed and thought about.  
Too many people focus on the downward trend of bitcoin over the past 18 months or so from a very large bubble but disregard the overall trend since it's inception, which is still heading upward. We've just about recovered from that bubble. The next 5 years are going to be very interesting.   
Even if bitcoin fails, another digital currency will take it's place.  
Bitcoin and the blockchain have proven to have value, proven to be profitable, and proven to have the ability to innovate.  
The technology behind this network is here to stay. It may go through some ups and down of fine tuning and experimentation, however, there is significant value behind this technology.

Right there with you bud. I can't even tell you how many times I heard I was catching a falling knife. Now some of my most vocal colleagues don't even talk to me anymore.
