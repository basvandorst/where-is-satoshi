My secret set of words is from multiple randomizers and is 90+ letters/numbers I’m pretty sure it’s fairly secure with random words and personal information

You can retire on 21 bitcoin NOW look up Andrew jikei on arbitration. You could sell your bitcoin for almost 300 grand put it into dividend stocks and get 800 dollars a month in dividends. It may seem small where you live but their are many nice places you can easily live off that like astrakhan Russia and South American cities. GL my friend
