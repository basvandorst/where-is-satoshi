It's called cutting your losses. It's not easy but it might be the smartest decision you'll ever make.  
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:06:28
Where does it work? I need to go buy some food and everyone within 100 miles of me has said "what's a Bitcoin?". 
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:16:49
Upward movement/ stop the plummet first. 
Pipe dreams second. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:35:19
It starts to become 12 month performance showing even and then down big. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 19:58:13
Further crashing just means a deeper bear market. Not the end of one.  
@_date: 2018-09-30 22:01:23
Please provide a shred of evidence that proves your claim. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 23:04:00
What about the lower highs?
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:21:34
Bad news. Its not "the whales". The natural tend is down right now. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 03:43:17
Yes, 6 months for me. Open ended for him. 
Don't you read?  
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:04:38
Strange. If hashrate represents demand, and hashrate is up six fold, then why is value down 70%?
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:22:51
Nope. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:00:52
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:50:30
Hey friends!  I've been so busy getting rich with the wsb guys on AMD that i haven't checked in in a while. What's the latest here?
@_date: 2018-09-28 11:52:41
Then how come demand has gone down as infrastructure has increased and supply remained finite?
@_date: 2018-09-28 13:48:50
Fair enough. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:44:57
Your deleted post had nothing to do with personal investment info. It was you accusing me of sharing the same IP with another user you disagree with. Sometimes it's better to admit fault than dig yourself deeper into a lie. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:38:57
Keep guessing. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 14:43:54
How are these remotely comparable?  The marshmallow test guaranteed the additional marshmallow. Bitcoin hitting an all time high again is a long shot. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 15:24:33
You realize you just criticize people as negative and pessimistic rather than address the facts they bring up, right?  
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:27:40
Ding ding ding. Winner winner chicken dinner.  
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:07:20
Feel free to get a moderator to chime in, but this will undeniably confirm you're delusional if you really believe this. 
Do you also imagine every post supporting your moon theories is 100 bitcoin fanatics behind a single keyboard?
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:28:14
If BTC lives up to potential, nobody knows where it goes. If it doesn't, it'll be relegated to the dustbin.
I've narrowed it down to the "sound" portion of the advice. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 22:56:21
Lol. I didn't realize a 9 month crash was considered a party in some parts. I must have walked in the wrong door. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:42:57
At the rate its going, please don't forget halved or even quartered!  Anything can happen!!!
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:48:21
Should be based on what?
@_date: 2018-09-28 02:26:28
I have to say, a definite time period vs "when I feel like it" seems like a pretty lopsided agreement, no?
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:54:10
When value is 100% speculative the only value that matters is now. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:36:34
History may have repeated itself then. It doesn't always do that. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:18:57
I do. Now show me how you quantify it. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:56:33
So every investment you make is based on pure speculation?
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:22:18
Right, my point is the reason they won't be buying is because it is too volatile.  The world just watch it lose 60% of it's value in about 6 months. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 23:47:44
Nope, that's not the post. You claimed it was going to happen within two hours at one point. I think you moved your prediction to 24 hours later. Both, 110% wrong. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:53:14
What about the assets on deadcoins.com?
@_date: 2018-09-26 23:12:07
That's right. I forgot you're smarter then the market and are ahead of the curve. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:04:27
Doing something really sketchy and then claiming your phone was stolen and hacked?   Very original. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 13:15:31
That's called knowledge. You have no knowledge that bitcoin's adoption and utility will increase and it sounds like no knowledge that it has been increasing. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:04:56
Great example of the level of sophistication the average Bitcoin investor has...
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:55:55
There is no math behind picking points, grabbing a ruler, and drawing a line. 
Also, if you want to bring that back up, anyone who followed your advice would have gotten their ass handed to them with where the price is now. Great job!  Keep it up!!!
@_date: 2018-09-14 19:19:59
Rebutting a valid point with a personal insult. Well done. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:47:23
Ok. So we're comparing an absolute certainty to a "near certainty" that price trends indicate is even more and more of a long shot for whatever reason.  Got it. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:59:21
This isn't about optimism.  This is about reality.  Do you really think it's that simple?  Do you really think Wall Street and investment funds would be ignoring low hanging fruit like that?  They spend tens of millions of dollars to make pennies that sum up to a 10% annual return.  You're not some genius that has identified an unknown opportunity and got in ahead of the curve. The early adopters got very lucky, but that ship has sailed and the boom is long over. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:03:14


Is this you finally admitting this is nothing more than a lotto ticket for you?
@_date: 2018-09-14 20:34:57
Because it has cash flows (historical and forecast), cash on the balance sheet, a management team, etc that you can value. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:08:14
Don't worry. It's gone back up before and that means it will do it again. 100,% guaranteed. 
Figured I'd sun up everyone else's investment thesis for you...
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:43:49
Yup, right after the etf and institutional money show up.  Aaaaaanyyyyyy daaaay nooooow.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:35:17
It was only a matter of time before the "this is bullish" guy poked his head out. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 18:33:15
You realize you can only say that for another month or two, right?
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:47:29
Good to know.  Is there a card that keeps it from losing 15% of its value when I go to sleep at night?  
@_date: 2018-09-11 23:42:37
Past performance is not indicative of future results. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:38:58
How did it grow so fast so early?  Every Bitcoin on Earth totaled up to a value in the  low millions.  Folks in their basement and a handful of deep pockets could get some upward momentum started that resulted in the bubble we saw at the end of last year. Doublings and triplings now require hundreds of billions of dollars to agree on these values. The projections at $100k require trillions of dollars. The growth early on and where this is today are so absurdly different that even comparing them demonstrates you're not looking at facts.  
@_date: 2018-09-26 22:44:09
They markets seem to disagree with you
@_date: 2018-09-05 15:53:06
Just means the people who dumped had the info before it hit the wires. Nothing new there. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:04:12
His name was u/ghee99. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:11:30
Nearly a 20% drop in two days... Good for bitcoin!!!!  Love it. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 13:41:12
It doesn't concern you that this forecast is based on nothing more than a line being drawn across a few hand chosen points in the past?  The fact it makes no assumptions on the future beyond picking a price out of the air and drawing a line to it?   
@_date: 2018-09-25 15:46:38
"Never" is an answer to "when?". 
@_date: 2018-09-14 18:32:27
Why would you want to buy if you just saw value slashed?   
@_date: 2018-09-10 01:35:54
I heard some guy bought a biscotti with Bitcoin in Pittsburgh today!!!!  This is so bullish.   It will be main stream any day now!  
@_date: 2018-09-27 23:38:19
6,700 is now considered a surge. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 23:37:49
We've bottomed... Until the next low. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:49:46
Sure, but unfortunately that first operating system isn't what got a foothold and its nothing more than a relic today.  The ones that people talk about today were 10 iterations and decades of advancement down the road.  Bitcoin might endup being the equivalent of DOScoin.  
@_date: 2018-09-18 20:20:54
Why would a programmer have any idea when the price is going back up. The only answer is no one knows. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:31:31
It doesn't. Price is dictated by demand. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 04:06:12
This guy gets it. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:13:24
Nope, just everyone who has had their money in sound investments (the stock market and real estate) has been making money hand over fist and can splurge on luxury goods now and then.  That pricing makes sense to me. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 00:38:04
Sure, I'll own up to being wrong. What is your deadline for admitting you've been wrong and folding the cards?
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:20:58
I'm f'ing honored. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:17:03
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:08:00
Any charts that demonstrate actual transactions using Bitcoin?  Not trades...
@_date: 2018-09-19 13:48:22
Or, they just let continue initiating sells any time there is a small rally. It doesn't need to hit zero for the bears to make money. Why would they ever stop this?
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:33:09
Why are you deleting your comments?  Outlandish claims and theories finally catching up to you?
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:39:31
Probably the most reasonable explanation I've heard for pricing thus far. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:50:20
There is value to that... The challenge is getting the other 99.9999% of the world to sign on to your theory and ditch the status quo. Until that happens the value is 100% speculative. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 22:56:24
You need help. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 04:04:14
Neither of those equal a guaranteed price increase.  Increased demand does. 
That's it. 
Neither or those items guarantees an increase in demand. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 23:27:26
Your prediction was 100% wrong. You stated a timeframe and it didn't happen in that timeframe.  
@_date: 2018-09-14 17:51:17
So, according to history this will never be a stable currency (history dictates it will crash again) which is a requirement for it to it ever gaining adoption and the utility that everyone is saying will drive it's value.
So which argument do you pick?  It will go up because it has before or will it go up because of adoption. 
You can't have both. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 20:18:10
No.  Governments are inherently tied to the financial interests of a Nation. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 03:50:28
Looks preeeeeettty damn similar to this sub...  and I'm having lots of laughs...

Rocks sink. Not bounce. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:06:03
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:36:32
You realize they are bankers, right?  They don't want this to win.  This is pennies for some of the big desks. Their big bucks come from the system as it is.  You thought Goldman was going to be on your team?  Which way do you think they plan on keeping the pressure?  
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:39:12
Yah, that's because it doesn't work that way. Bitcoin is worth exactly what someone will pay for it. Not a product of their mining equipment and local utility rates. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:58:06
Fair enough. 
You seriously need to check your IP sources though.  I post under a single name and this is it. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:25:27
This is the big leagues. I'm rolling with some bsd's here. 3rd place is an honor.

@_date: 2018-08-14 16:46:21
Well, that's how a logarithmic chart scales, but the projections are absurd.

@_date: 2018-08-30 14:05:14
Another day another excuse. Anyone who followed your expert advice and bought on your guidance yesterday evening would have lost nearly 10% of their investment already.  
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:27:24
You all wanted institutional money.  This is the new natural for the market.  Welcome to the big leagues!  
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:13:21
What do you mean when you say it's doing brilliantly in comparison?  Are you just comparing it's 24 hour price movement and comparing to the stock market today?
@_date: 2018-08-30 21:11:42
Thanks for sharing that totally unbiased article!  Please look up 'a bearish case for Bitcoin'. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:41:51
I'm talking about people who are in and out several times a day... Which is what actually generates volume. Not the long term investor that finally caves in and sells. 
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:16:40
Oh yes!  The etf! 
Aaaaannnnnyyyy daaaaaaaaaay noooooooooooooooow.  
How many months have we been saying that and what is the next last bastion of hope when that fails?  The bottom is still up in the air (pun intended) until this bear market is over. It's clinging on to $7,000 for dear life at the moment. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 16:37:50
It also relies 100% on past performance to indicate future results...  
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:34:11
Ok. So by your reasoning, one btc was actually worth ~$1,000 in December '17, but that amount was grossly inflated by hype.  It is correctly valued today at 6x this amount based on increase in hashrate. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 14:16:57
So, not Unix. Got it. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:32:56
Outside of a small niche, people only care for Bitcoin in the hopes they'll get rich quick.  It will fade into obscurity along with those dreams.  Without adoption it is worthless. The 2017 bubble is what will end up being it's demise. No one with half a brain (that isn't a fanatic at least) will touch the stuff after it's 2018 plummet.  There is literally zero intrinsic value in place to act as a backstop to keep it from going back to pennies per coin.  
@_date: 2018-08-10 09:26:12
So you're telling us it can go down, up, or sideways?  Thanks
@_date: 2018-08-18 00:13:58
The price tells what the market is doing. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:08:13
But you predicted never below 6k again...
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:50:13
He sure did. Can't wait to hear the reasoning behind his miss and how this only means better things are to come. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:49:27
Don't let it happen to you!
@_date: 2018-08-10 03:01:36
Yes, same site that says Bitcoin will be at $100,000 by end of 2019. Very reputable.

When required, yes. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:04:52
TIL down 70% = strong
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:55:09
Huh?  Compared to what?  Other coins or other investments. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:24:30
Referring to your never under 6k again..
 Live with it.  Comment from yesterday?

What does a nation's balance sheet have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:07:43
Just like the last time you said that, right?  And the time before that?

You can buy a lotto ticket any given day of the week.  People spend x% of their income doing it. Not x% of their net worth.

@_date: 2018-08-30 14:23:47
So, back to your 'it happened before argument'?  Got it. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:08:45
Interesting. Based on price over that time period there are far more sellers than buyers of Bitcoin. Things appear to be bleeding out of it too.  
@_date: 2018-08-24 18:11:18
Great news guys!  New ath for s&amp;p and nasdaq today!   
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:19:52
Traders are playing Bitcoin because it has the most liquidity. That mitigates some of their risk. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:11:05
This is a surprise?  Volatile assets lead to high frequency trades and high volume. Stable assets are not favorable to trade which leads to low volume. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:17:06
This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:54:15
Lol. If your whole investment thesis is based on the US economy collapsing you can make a lot, lot stronger roi by making that bet through financial instruments other than Bitcoin.

Yah, I'm curious who is supposed to be adopting and where this new money is supposed to appear from. All the Bitcoin fanatics are either cashed out or have been caught holding the bag. Any new money is going to be scared as hell after seeing it nose dive.

Unnamed sources from a highly biased blog??? Good enough for me!   I'm going all in !!!
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:21:32
Lower price in USD does not mean lower volume.  Traders don't size by number of shares. They size by Dollar amounts. Come on man. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:57:56
You're right. You're the smartest guy in the room. The countless MIT grads on wall strret and tech geniuses on seven figure salaries are simply letting this opportunity go right by them.  You're the only person that knows about this easy and risk free road to riches.  
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:54:25
Beta requires and is only useful with correlation. Bitcoin moves aren't tied to anything ( that I'm aware of this point). There is a difference between beta and simply being erratic. 
And I apologise for not keeping up with budfoxnews.com
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:44:16
It's just a comparison point to show how absurd that assumption is by coming up with the largest single unit of money I could find. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:38:28
Lol. Back to the ol etf story?  Wasn't everyone so butt hurt after the last one that they claimed they didn't need it?
@_date: 2018-08-09 20:28:19
Have you considered taking out a cash advance on your credit card or mortgaging your home?  More Bitcoin=more instant riches

Ok, so if I throw $100 into the fire and burn it to ash I technically haven't lost anything until I sell that ash?  We can totally ignore the fact that my purchasing power is entirely gone?  Thats reasonable!
I think your methodology is referred to as 'lying to yourself'.
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:48:25
And you base this claim on ___________ ?
@_date: 2018-05-11 18:18:16
That is simple math!  Probably too simple. Way too simple. You may want to check your numbers. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:10:13

If an ETF is approved, you will probably get the pump you've all been dreaming of, but I'd be ready to hit that 'realize profits' button shortly after trading begins because I think it will be very short lived.

It seems like you had already made up your mind so why did you bother creating this post?  
A lot of the people who lost their homes had adjustable rate mortgages (idiots), over levered (idiots), or fudged their application to qualify for more home than they could afford (idiots).  Also, how does a house become unaffordable based on it's value going down if the payments don't change?
You seem set on the get rich quick and easy strategy so I'd imagine you'd probably purchase a home in this manner, too.

1,000%?  Boring.  Purchased Nvidia starting  in 2012. Safe investment with strong balance sheet and cashflow. I considered it risk free at the time so I was comfortable buying 1,000+ shares even though that was a substantial chunk of change at the time.  I had shares with 2,000% gains.

@_date: 2018-06-28 21:05:57
So?  Nothing happened?  Maybe this chicken blood reading is all BS!
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:24:37
Smart people sell on the weekly highs?  You realize that would mean theyre entirely guessing when they put their sell order in, right?
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:32:49
You realize when I sell my shares I exchange them for cash... I'm not simply giving them away, right?
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:48:08
There are people here talking about pulling their kids college funds to invest them in a plummeting currency.  The f'ing hope and hype train on this board has the potential to wreck people's lives. Take a look at what happened to the people who listened to Cramer when he was honking horns and flashing lights saying bear Stern's was at rock bottom. They got wiped out.  History might be repeating itself. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 22:31:23
Last year was not driven by people looking for utility and a store of value. That was entirely get rich quick speculation. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:54:07
"only a market cap of gold"... 
Do you hear yourself?  
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:36:47
This is exactly my point.  You're stating long shot gambles as facts. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:14:12
Why are 'shares' in quotes?  Believe it or not, you cancelling your account has had zero impact on the stock price. Its up over 100% ytd. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 23:58:41
The market has agreed with me for the last six months.
Bitcoin itself is not a scheme. I'll agree with that.  The scheme is people who are thinking it will make them rich overnight with no effort. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:15:57
I only have 3 pillows on my couch. They are even more rare than Bitcoin!  That doesnt mean they're worth shit. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:52:45
Huh?  The shorts are raking it in and will continue to do so. Why would they need to close out their positions?  Something external would have to cause the price to spike for their to be a squeeze that forces shorts to exit their position.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:59:27
Sure. Same as if you bought Bitcoin and didn't settle the contract for cash value.

Best music. Best fashion. Best coke. Best decade. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:18:59
Don't like lambos. Too loud and ostentatious for my taste. Always been more of a Jaguar guy. 
It's not boasting when you're being called out on a specific metric and explaining how you surpassed that... With a much safer investment, to boot. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 23:14:38
Don't blame yourself. We're actively warning people not to do this shit, but you still have people on here pumping it and saying it will make you rich if you simply buy it and wait around. If you say otherwise you're a 'fuder'.
Good luck earning it back in one way or another. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:33:09
Sure does make me scratch my head when I've heard so much about Bitcoins security revolutionizing the financial system. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:27:44
Have you ever heard the saying "it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion"?
Just wondering...
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:29:05
Still in about 12 bitcoins worth. Thanks. Best of luck with the girlfriend. Being yourself until you run across someone equally as weird finally worked for me.  Hopefully youll have the same luck. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:41:26
What if I told you....
Bitcoin IS a shitcoin...
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:06:11
Yah!  Give us more silly stories about why it will go to $100,000!
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:12:31
Just like Bitcoin rebounded off previous lows to an ath until It doesn't?
@_date: 2018-11-21 07:27:56
Hard to prove someone guilty that won't appear in court. What do you think he's running from?
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:03:19
Do you ever listen to yourself?

Great theory. Good luck getting it into practice. World peace and an automated society where no one works would be nice, while you're at it. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:25:25
You forgot a reason for everyday people wanting to use Bitcoin:  They enjoy waking up to find 25% of their purchasing power has disappeared. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:27:17
Undervalued based on what?  It's price 12 months ago is not a valid answer. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:12:33
Too busy laughing that everyone is excited about 4200.   We would have been called fud or paid trolls if we told you we'd be at 4,200, let alone that you'd be excited about it, only 20 days ago. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:48:04
That's a lot of ifs. Fact is, right now it's a disaster of an investment. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:55:55
They can choose whichever money they please... The person they transact with just also needs to agree
1. That It's money.  
2. With it's value

Really?  Check out deadcoins.com.  Their cycle was "different". 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:37:47
Really?  A 12 month 80% price drop won't impact adoption?
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:27:13
Throw good money after bad. Great advice. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:54:54
I don't.  There is no need to believe in something when it has been accepted and issue free every single time I have used it (even better in situations when I use credit card... protection and rewards!).   Do you believe in gravity?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:27:04
Why are you expecting a short squeeze when the price is in free fall?  You don't seem to be following your own advice. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 01:22:20
I'm sure everyone here has been in since that point, too. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:50:26
It's only called manipulation when there is downward movement here. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:21:51
What do I care as long as I get the reward?  My money is in my wallet. It exists. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:09:28
Hmmm, I think there is some saying about past performance that is applicable here...
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:20:15
We understand that. No one questions it.  You're investment thesis relies on about five layers of Black swan events.  
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:29:39
Nope, just a bubble continuing to pop. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:40:09
He's been right for the last year. You've been wrong.  Who's making foolish gambles?
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:21:56
If you really believe this then why the hell would you have your hand in the cookie jar?  
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:38:03
Thats right. Youre the one telling people to simply wait 18 months, do nothing, and get a 20x return. That's perfectly reasonable.

Not a concern for me or 99.9% of the population. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:56:03
This is a totally lopsided bet.  If a bitcoin is worth $500 you'll be donating $500 to them... If it is worth $100,000, like you're claiming, certainly you can spare $25,000 as a donation.  Make it based on a fixed amount in something not terribly volatile, like USD for example, if you want it to have some validity.  At the rate we're going, the bet your proposing will be paying for a group of 4's dinner for the evening.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:17:07
Umm, it's down over 60% over the last year.

Wow. The future is here!  
I used venmo with someone sitting across the table from me yesterday. Instant transfer. Instant confirmation. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:59:31
What is this price appreciation you're referring to?
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:11:01
Maybe, but the stock market is split up among tens of thousands of companies... so, that's not happening.  Also, this was closer to .2%.
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:22:59
It's a market. It's value today is based on what the market anticipates in the future.
What happened yesterday or over the last ten years has zero impact on today's value. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:34:22
Good luck getting the everyday user to buy in after they pull up price history. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:30:16
But Bitcoin is a random speculative token. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:51:43
It's only worth what the next guy will pay for it.  If there is always one person to pay at least $1 it will never go below $1. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:36:15
Is this me being accused of being someone else again?  
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:10:22
Bitcoin didn't do that. The greater fools who bid it up over the years did it. They are gone now.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:01:42
This is the same guy that said:


On September 19 when Bitcoin was trading at $6,500.  Be careful with who you take advice from.  
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:56:51
Not close at all. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:56:42
What is price sabotage?  
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:04:35
Read through your post history and try counting how many times you try to persuade people to invest in this dumpster fire by promising easy riches and returns.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:34:51
Dca is fine as a strategy. Just not when you're on 5x margin and risk getting closed out. 
Also, when there were $1,000 candles they didn't reflect a 20+% upward move. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:58:57
Except by your thesis no one will have it and those who do will be holding it so it won't actually be used....
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:13:38
You mean things that work better and have already received mass adoption?
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:44:59
New fundamentals = jarvenranta says so.  
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:38:50
Well, no one will ever accuse you of lacking optimism, at least. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 15:10:58
Maybe if there weren't people here preaching that bitcoin's reversal is starting tomorrow and it will be over $20k in the next 3 months we wouldn't see this happen so often.

You spam bullshit in here.  Why are you doing it if you don't think it will impact price?
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:54:35
Great. They can build whatever they want. It has no value if it's not used. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:48:57
Unfortunately you told everyone to use their emergency funds on the last "dip". 
@_date: 2018-11-15 00:48:22
Nope, you just implied that all the cycles have a happy ending or an up after the down.  They don't, my man. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:14:48
That's a great theory once the adoption question is figured out. Right now global currencies seem to have a strangle hold monopoly, though.  Why would someone want to keep Bitcoin in their wallet if they don't know if it will but them 1/100 of a loaf of bread or 10 loafs of bread in 6 months?
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:09:30
Yet you can predict $100,000 per coin by a specific date?   
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:59:47
I thought 9,000 was the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:08:04
Is no-coiner an insult?  I'm confused. None of my investments have lost 40% of their value in the last 72 hours. Is that bad?
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:23:55
It isn't going anywhere, just like Lehman brothers or home values that always go up!
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:47:36
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:02:52
Yikes.  God speed, hombre.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:35:25
Not when it follows a 40% dump in 4 days. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:52:13
I will.  It works great.  
Take a look at price trends over the last 12 months and the consensus seems to agree with me.  People are abandoning bitcoin as it can't seem to get any traction with practical usability or adoption.   
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:29:33
Errrm, what???
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:59:17
Maybe people will start taking cryptos seriously when there is actual discussion about utility and value in place of these silly memes that are posted all day.  I follow the stuff for entertainment value, but best I can tell the majority of the 'investor' base is aged 14-18 while Wall Street is taking this thing for a ride and laughing the whole way along.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:15:11
This is the most millennial headline I've ever seen. Ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:38:39
Wanna make a bet?
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:53:03
Those are annoying but the $100k/ bc predictions aren't?
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:27:39
Totally practical to ad that step to every small transaction you make!
@_date: 2018-03-30 16:57:26
They are. That's why I think this is a joke of an investment. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:49:42
Guess what else you can't buy with credit cards. 
Lotto tickets. 
You have to gamble with your own money.  
@_date: 2018-11-14 23:48:18
Maybe you should be looking at the potential that bitcoin is as worthless as Bcash rather than just point the blame elsewhere?
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:09:41
Did he purchase those cars?  If he only has a million in the bank and blown the rest on the card he's going to be in the poor house very quickly. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:27:59
What about yours pal that is claiming coins will be at $100k each by mid 2021?  You're saying he's wrong?
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:19:46
You are not supporting each other. You are creating a destructive feedback loop of hearing only what you want to hear to hang on to the dream of getting rich overnight for doing nothing. 
We were doing the same thing at 10k, 8k, and 6k. If you had listened to us at any point you would be thanking us. The story is no different now. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:21:27
Weird. People were saying the same shit at $6,200. Was that smart money too?
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:21:21
Interesting points, but the basis of the main ones are opinions only held by bitcoiners. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:51:23
Annnnnnnyyy day now.  I feel like I've heard this investment theory before.  
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:53:40
I thought etf was tomorrow?
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:18:39
Because they're convincing people to make irrational, all in bets, on the promise of overnight riches. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:15:26
All you need to do is make a risky bet and get incredibly lucky!  
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:06:43
This. Part of the reason I don't take Bitcoin seriously is because 99% of the investment thesis seems to be based on memes. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:20:31
It's great insight for anyone that owns a time machine. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 01:56:16
Its not a falling knife at that point.  At 15% of its 4 month high its called a falling, radioactive, on fire, chainsaw.  Good luck.     
@_date: 2018-04-09 22:36:48
Step 1:  Horde all bitcoin so there is no use, demand, or application for them.

Step 3:  Profit.

Pro tip:  Number sold = number bought.   
Look up "Volume"
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:20:21
It's the best store of value?!  It's nearly 70% off it's all time high in 4 months!  I can't come up with a worse store of value in recent history. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:15:34
It's happening right now. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:13:03
No one knows???
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:05:16
Desperation is a stinky cologne.  
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:26:15
Crypto isn't going to establish value in a vacuum. It needs utility in the real world for that to happen. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:44:35
There are two sides to a market....  
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:43:58
This isn't fear. You'll know when it's fear. Honest opinion from my experience.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:34:50
Because Bitcoin always always goes up and isn't in a bubble. Moon. Lambo. 
That's a summary of other arguments I've read, at least. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:38:08
Except you can't base your prediction on historical data in this gamble...
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:00:49
Or ever. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:28:20
70% from ath is a small drop?
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:10:20
No one talks trash when someone saves in Fiat because it's already achieved the mass circulation and utility that you refer to. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:14:06
Quite a conspiracy!  Keep going!  This is fun. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 14:48:51
This is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:32:32
You can take that standpoint, but my opinion is that it has no value until it has mass utility.  It's just a string of code hanging out in the ether until then. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:16:28
That moment you realize big money, and not people holding .5 coins chanting 'hodl', controls the market. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:18:53
It's not a popular opinion here. Everyone screams hold and moon, but doesn't aknowledge there is no value in a currency if it's not utilized for actual transactions.  
Trader a paying trader b does nothing but feed speculation. 
 
A consumer paying a vendor in currency (and a consistent amount of it) time and time again establishes actual value. 
People love to preach about world changing technology and "breaking the system", but it really feels like a thinly veiled prayer for their get rich quick dreams. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:34:20
It's not an investment. It has no intrinsic value. It's a speculative currency. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:29:28
That's not what you said.  What are the odds long term?
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:14:46
This argument really makes no sense. If they're shaking out all the weak hands who the hell will buy the coins back when all the confidence in the market is lost?  
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:09:55
This is good for Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2018-04-26 13:08:10
Consistent growth?  Its been nearly 70% off all time highs in just the last few weeks.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:39:56
I agree with the argument, but my arbitrary reasonable price is $225. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:06:48
So you're OK with the market staying at these levels until you've bought enough that you're ready for it to go up.  Please show me the magic button you plan on pressing so it will go up when you're ready.  
@_date: 2018-04-18 22:46:08
You're living on a dream, dude.  
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:59:33
Good point. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 17:07:18
You realize your advice only applies to a diverse portfolio of staple investments, not a single, speculative asset, right?
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:34:56
Ooor, just maybe, no one thinks it's worth more than this and is willing to pay up to prove it. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:45:06
Thinking positive is about as useful as thoughts and prayers. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 19:02:04
Lol. You may have lost your mind.  GL. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:58:53

I have never seen the hypocrisy that I laugh at every day here summed up so well in one image.  Bravo. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:11:29
How is it 50/50?  You just said there is no way it will go down far...  Pick a wish and stick to it. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:31:48
Yup, can wait to move my money from an insured bank account to an exchange waiting to be hacked. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:46:25
How does it have better stores of value than a physical object?  What properties?  It's a bit of code stored on hard drives. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:02:18
The day ain't over....
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:22:48
Looks like its a single image file to me. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:43:18
Not with your life savings you don't. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:16:29
"The low". 
Are you referring to today's, next week's, the week after, or so on?

OK. Deal. I get 10 million coins, you get 10 million coins.  It's on the idea guy to find the strippers to start pumping singles into ATMs and buy the remaining million of them. Please let me know when I can start dumping mine. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:12:40
Agreed. Add it to the list of issues. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:46:45
By your math their are 17 million people holding slightly more than 17 million Bitcoin.  What about all the whales or the sneaky banks that are manipulating this down so they can accumulate?
@_date: 2018-12-10 18:24:38
Lol. Wat?
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:41:01
That car is more like $30k USD 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:17:45
We all know how stable Bitcoin has been. I'm sure it'll be first place they turn. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:25:09
At the pace it's happening you'll be waiting far more than decades, if not forever. In that case, why do you want your money there?  
@_date: 2018-12-13 15:17:50
No, adoption is held back by volatility. The exact reason the poster you're responding to mentioned. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:08:24
Nope, just a guy who loves cars.

Do they hand out tinfoil hats to anyone that wants to be a "hodler"?

Two days later:. Continues begging sec for etf approval. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 19:04:25
Don't forget to remind people of that during the 10% "bull runs" when they start talking about what color lambo they're buying. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:08:30
You may have just made me a believer.  Is Titcoin a thing?
@_date: 2018-12-07 13:31:42
This is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:03:18
This guy gets it. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:50:26
I can help you with your assumption. They're not. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:13:05
But people were saying that at 6,500 and the have lost half their money since then. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:14:53
AMG badges on a non AMG car and a license plate claiming he swings dicks with the big dogs?
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:23:25
That's what people said at $6,200.  
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:10:42
Meh, everyone knows the new 43s aren't real AMGs.   They are an appearance package and slightly hotter tune of the base models motor.  No hand built engine or any of the lineage that were prerequisite for an AMG model until the MB marketing department told them otherwise.  
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:01:29
Anyone who's still holding on to hope that there is an ath in the future.

"If you buy something like bitcoin or some cryptocurrency, you don't have anything that is producing anything.  You're just hoping the next guy pays more. And you only feel you'll find the next guy to pay more if he thinks he's going to find someone that's going to pay more.  You aren't investing when you do that, you're speculating."

So what is the case for utility if it's not used for transactions?  You can't have both.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:41:09
I'm just trying to clarify the meaning of the term. I've heard it thrown around recently as an insult... and Ive had trouble understanding how not holding an investment that lost 80% of it's value in 12 months is a bad thing. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:46:40
This is much different. This is Titcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 19:13:24
That would be awesome. Free house. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:42:54
Might be a c class but definitely not a c63, and possibly not even a c43, based on that exhaust. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:42:29
Please remind me how this is the future if a single actor can swing the price like this. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:10:54
Urrrrm, I hate to break the bad news to you, but the market seems to think it was really bad for Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:19:29
That would mean they set the supply of the dollar. The free markets set the value of the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:25:19
Because I enjoy the dialog. 
How is a 80% drop growth?  If it is so predictable I'd imagine you've been short this year?
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:06:08
You didn't address your hypocrisy. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:39:24
What difference does what I drive make?
It's not a 63 and doubtful about it being a 43 (not that the 43 is a real AMG). 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:26:36
Can we call a vote?  
Given the price trends of crypto over the last 12 months, the term "no coiner" will be complimentary in nature and be used to commend an individual's foresight, sound investment strategy, and reluctance to take part in get rich quick schemes. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:01:54
Looks like an a class sedan to me, but I could be off. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:13:25
I'm writing my thesis on denial and delusion. The information I have gleaned from this sub is fascinating.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:01:05
Better close out my short positions. This guy says so.   
Next stop moon. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:55:02
Why does % of peak market cap have anything to do with what you consider a bottom. It's quantity of coins that might be held, but they're value is 100% dependent on what the coins that are actively traded are doing. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:56:39
So basically a system that inherently over compensates those who got in very early, incentivizes them to hype and pump the price, and leaves those who got in late stuck with the useless coins are putting far too much resource into continued mining?  Sounds exactly like what were watching play out. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:28:42
So everyone just has their debts waived?  Ok guy. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:19:18
 I do understand. You're saying it recovered before so it'll recover again. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:46:05
Lol. This again?  
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:15:00
Naive would be assuming previous results might be indicative of future performance. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:56:50
In your hypothetical situation... Sure

Tells us anyone who has ever gotten a price prediction right was simply lucky. 
Proceeds to give price predictions. 
Is this an intentional shit post or simple trolling?

Still wont accept that some technologies and innovations simply don't catch on, as great as they are, eh?  Bitcoins own ambition is it's own worst enemy. Youre not asking for people to change the way they watch porn. You're asking for a huge change to the fabric of global society.
