Explaining a joke is never funny but: Its Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan, a very popular movie that most people know. Pretending its  Tom Cruise is a play on the common knowledge. This makes it suprising because you know its a joke, because the movie is too popular and the error to blatant to be taken seriously.

It would be if they tell something about the results of this. It has been almost 2 months, so i would guess some kind of progress is made? If they didn't comply they would have been fined. If they did, then the lackluster of news about this can be taken as that the requested information didn't have any illegal implecations. Atleast thats what i think. 
So no news then? So much panick over nothing at all.

The last couple of hours the mempool has filled up again. This morning a tx with 5sat/byte was enough because of the room in the blocks. Better to wait if possible for it to go down again to those levels.

Call it Fast Bitcoin Cash, fbcash, get users to think facebook has a coin and make lots of money and at the same time mock roger ver.

But what is the news here? What did the cftc want? The article doesn't say anything with this. It could be to testify or simply show a single document. There isn't any content nor context. What does this news mean then?

You can sort of call it an addon. Thanks to LN we can do offchain transaction at almost no cost and instantly. You put bitcoins on a channel and from there you can spend instantly and wiith very low fees. This will make bitcoin adoption huge.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:02:28
I think most of those posts are coming from people buying from coinbase instead of GDAX. Coinbase doesnt have segwit, so most new people get a high fee trying to send to their wallets.

To be fair it has a certain exotic feel compared to some other places where he has given talks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:46:57
No, why? its centralized so its not at all more like the bitcoin white paper, but that doesnt matter. Roger ver is prepared to ruin trust in crypto to shill his stupid knock off coin. Just create your own coin and dont try to steal another name and this whole bullshit would not happen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:08:06
Again, not the point, BCH is centralized, more then 50% of the nodes are alibaba and amazon. So you cant use the argument that its according to the white paper. Decentralisation is an important part of bitcoin.  All the power of bcash lies with 2 psychos. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:31:04
I was thinking the same thing. BCH destroyed itself by tarnishing the bitcoin name and making people lose trust in crypto in general because of him. Hew is one of the worst things in this industry
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:39:40
In greece people lost 20% of the money they had in the bank, the goverment toook it to bail the banks out. Try doing that to bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:58:33
It also states decentralized. This can easly be interpreted as everybody should be able to run a node, not only people who have petabytes of storage and a limitles internetconection. therefore scaling must always be done in a way that doesnt increase the blockchain size. If all options are depleted, then a blocksize increase would be appropriate.
The argument of bcash being true to satoshis vision is therefore mute.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:34:24
Coinbase hasnt even tried.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:06:12
a couple of satoshi or free even, depends on the node.

If they did, the interview with Brian sure didn't make me feel like they did. He waved it away. But i think the push of the community now is going to accelerate things, atleast thays what i hope.

if you bought a couple of months ago that 50k is now 150k, so dont you still have more then with what you started? Sounds a little fake to me.

Because you sell bitcoins on an exchange... He's not waiting on btc but fiat. How is your wallet going to pay you in fiat? You can't, you need an exchange.

less then 0.50% of the total ammount of btc transacted last 24h is paid to thousands and thousands of miners or about 25milion$ at current prices. ((1800btc mined per day x price) x2 for compensating for fees)

No, you have to fork Fast bitcoin cash and create Faster Bitcoin Cash, then i copy it and fork Fastest Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:30:05
Yeah the difference was greater then 1000$ at one point with bitfinex and bitstamp. Even with high fees, thats a really nice profit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:44:30
but isn't bcash just a slower litecoin? why the hype?

Doesnt POS eliminate miners? Transactions are processed by the biggest stake, aka the one that has put up the most ethereum, hence the name proof of stake. Or did i understand it all wrong?

The tulip bubble was all about futures. They never sold tulip bulbs but only bet on the price, and those people lost allot of money, but only those people. So people betting on btc futures can be a tulip bubble, but not bitcoin itself.

Im not sure, i see teethmarks on the trezor too :p
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:23:06
The tulip bubble was about futures according to a documentary, not the tulips itself. Not allot of tullips were actually sold at those high prices. Only futures being swapped, no actual cash for product.
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:01:02
Thats a big fallacy. For one thing i doubt Bcash can come anyware near the usersbase of real bitcoin. Second, it would be like yahoo changing its name to google if it gets more popular. Bcash is bcash; not bitcoin.

If BTC is aknowledged as a currency there, i dont think they need to pay taxes. Atleast here in Belgium it is a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:32:36
So this means that if s2x is the dominant chain after the fork, acces to real btc could be limited and only available after a certain time?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:50:13
I think if the dollar supply is low, but the need is high and also the need for bitcoin is high, this triggers a double scarcity. People want BTC AND USD. A seller is going to want as much USD as he possible can get in a sellers market before the bills runs out.

Well no actually he said he wants to distance himself from coinbase. The next sentence is a new statement saying that he's looking for a exchange, presumably he meant an exchange not linked to coinbase like GDAX.
