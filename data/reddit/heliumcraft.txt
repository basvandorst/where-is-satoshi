The "Alarm clock" is a DAO contract that allows other contracts to execute certain actions at predetermined times (kinda like a cron job). Were you thinking it was an alarm clock like the one in your iphone or something?
@_date: 2015-12-17 22:24:57
You can use it as an intermediary API so your dapps can access the blockchain in case the user is not running a node himself or using a Browser such as Mist or Metamask.

@_date: 2015-06-02 19:08:14
why not? it's just a client running in the background and then you just use your normal browser (e.g chrome). Alternatively you can simply use the Mist browser.

Not completely. Here is what [said about the choosing Ethereum](
Also, there is more to Ethereum than 'just' the smart contracts part. It's a platform for Decentralized Applications and not a currency, for that we already have Bitcoin.

forgive my rant, but the execution of your initial launch was disastrous, specially the constant promises about the edit page which was plagued with delays. I was a huge supporter, but you have really damaged my trust and of others, and in the meanwhile people are flocking to centralised, but reliable, services like keybase.io
You also have a lot to learn on being open: onename.io is basically a closed group of friends, outsiders are not really welcome. github repo is a textfile and little else.

If you think you wouldn't remember the passphrase, then don't use it. Other people might find it useful. There are pros &amp; cons, with brainwallets you don't have to worry about your laptop getting stolen or hacked.
@_date: 2014-09-06 14:45:37
Ok at least your point makes more sense than "don't ever use brain wallets".
I agree that one should not assume entropy. People might prefer though a 12 word passphrase that is more meaningful to them and easier to remember than a random 12 word from electrum. That doesn't make them dumb and you didn't need to be so harsh.

yeah... you're in for a surprise...
@_date: 2015-05-28 13:49:57
lol :) Well, remember that reddit can sometimes be a bit of an echo chamber. In this sub, positive posts about ethereum are downvoted to obvlion and negative posts upvoted. This essentially results in a picture that it's not quite like reality for those reading about ethereum in this sub and I reckon a lot of people would be surprised at the true state and scope of the Ethereum Platform.

This is the [general attitude]( you get in this subreddit torwards ethereum.
It is unfortunate and hopefully it will change,  ethereum can help bitcoin succeed and vice versa.
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:35:47
Actually in the case of Ethereum, a considerable portion of the community are application developers, the traders are probably the minority. You can see this with the number of subscribers 9000 vs 2100 , many of the maximalists are actually fairly new to Ethereum and came from Bitcoin. Most of community is not maximalist and does not even care that much about price, the main attraction for most people in the community are decentralized applications.

Given the lack of projects in Counterparty, that's either not totally true or smart contracts aren't a big deal at all. We'll see in the coming months.

How does that work?
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:37:35
I guess things changed around the gold rush back when the price went to $1200, it's all about going to the moon and making $$$ now... 
Bitcoin (and used to be about decentralization and changing the world that's how I still think about it, and in that sense, Ethereum is very much part of Bitcoin and connected to it.
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:04:21
try re-reading my comments.. I'm saying that Bitcoin (or at least **used to be** about blockchain technology, the community was excited about things like namecoin or even maidsafe, so long it aligned with the goals of a decentralized society.. at some point this changed - I'd say around the time we got inundated with people wanting to make an easy buck. And since then, it's no longer the same, it's a "us against them" kind of mentality
@_date: 2015-07-28 18:26:13
Ethereum is not out to replace Bitcoin, It can very well complement and help Bitcoin.
The problem with these shadowbans is that the mods always delete positive posts about ethereum, and often leave negative ones untouched creating as a result an echo chamber of misinformation.
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:32:35
Gone are the times when "Bitcoin" was term referring to the currency itself and ANY technology based on it...
@_date: 2016-02-09 19:10:22
In Ethereum is completely doable, you would need to be smart about gas costs though.
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:54:49
The moves can be sent directly as a transaction to the contract which would validate the moves and pay upon check mate being reached.  So yeah, no extra 3rd party server trust is needed.
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:23:38
[Testnet]( And the release is a [few days]( away....
@_date: 2016-02-09 19:53:49
If necessary yes. But there is a cost to it of which gets paid to the miners.
@_date: 2015-07-22 11:28:32
Not better, just different. Bitcoin supports some limited smart contracts that can perfectly be used in bitcoin itself. If you need something more complex, then Ethereum can complement Bitcoin in that aspect.
@_date: 2016-02-09 21:33:05
When miners validate a transaction they are executing/computing a script of that transaction - which in ethereum can be anything, including verifying a chess move.

All devs have heard something like this before: You just do the easy part and build the actual bridge. I'll do the "management" and come up with the ideas. In return, I shall generously give you 5% of the profit.
@_date: 2015-04-12 19:33:02
Yeah you are sort of changing the subject now... You specifically mentioned "Turing completeness? Trees instead of chains? 10-second blocktime?" as examples of impossible, snake oil.
Turing completeness and 10 second blocktimes already exists and has been long working since.. err.... PoC 1?? Ethereum has since then evolved into this great platform combining web technologies with a turing complete blockchain and a decentralized network, you can get develop for it TODAY (go to r/ethereum or irc or whatever if you need some help to get started). As for release date, a delay was expected for a software of this complexity and magnitude. It is well known fact to all developers that [software projects are always late]( Frankly I don't care that much if it's may or august, so long as it is done right. But I know that I can download today AlethZero or some other client and develop decentralized applications that were thought impossible a year ago...
You know, the truly sad thing is that, Ethereum is not even in competition with Bitcoin.. (with MaidSafe perhaps?) They have different purposes and therefore have different tradeoffs, and the kind of FUD we constantly see here helps no one. Ethereum might actually turn out to be the best thing to happen to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:52:33
Hold on.... Let me get this straight: You think things like Turing completeness and 10 second block times are snake oil? You're in for a surprise....
@_date: 2015-04-12 20:45:25
Look, if you're saying that it needs to be live to be 'battle tested' (even if security audits have been done), that's fine, I can accept that point. But don't say it's "impossible" or "snake oil"...
As for the 10 sec blocktime. Again, different uses, different tradeoffs. (And this is the point everyone keeps missing apparently...) 10 minute blocktimes are great for a currency. For a platform like ethereum, 10 secs is still too slow!
@_date: 2015-04-12 11:51:09
How do you deal with all the FUD and personal attacks common in this sub-reddit?
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:18:03
It’s likely this was a temporary password sent by sms from twitter which is often required to sign in with a twitter account on some iphone applications. It turns out that sending messages to this number tweets the messae. So he copied the password to paste it to the app but must have mistakenly pasted it as a reply instead which in turn tweeted the password.

There is a testnet (currently proof of concept 9) you can use and develop Dapps for it. If you are looking for the live net the release is eminent, possibly this month even. you can find more info [here](

So that's what makes ethereum contracts truly different and allow a range of applications that aren't possible otherwise. Yes, one can make some sort of "crowdfund" in Bitcoin with some hacks but it would never match the range of possibilities of a DAO with smart contracts.

What are the main differences to projects like MaidSafe, Storj and Ethereum's Swarm ?
@_date: 2015-02-23 02:24:24
That's not necessarily true. Bitcoin is great for payments, it has a HUGE reach. Ethereum on the otherhand is focused on decentralized applications not payments, so it's not in direct competition with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-18 21:06:10
Bitcoin "contracts" can't interact with other contracts and certainly not using an arbitrary set of conditions based on states set by previous interactions.
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:31:09
Your assuming that Ethereum (or the 'next thing') is a direct replacement, it is not. Ethereum is a threat to Bitcoin like Email is a threat to SSH. They have different purposes. Take the Internet, there are different applications, from Skype, Email, Web, IRC, etc.. Each of those are very good at what they do and have different purposes all together. Bitcoin is and will remain pretty good at payments, Ethereum is focused on decentralized applications and can complement Bitcoin nicely.
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:09:01
Bitcoin is an application of Blockchain Technology. The two terms have become synonymous in popular usage but they are different. A similar confusion is with the terms Internet and Web, they have become synonymous but they are two different things.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:01:23
A year ago is like 12 years ago in Ethereum terms :) It has a evolved a lot since then, beyond the basic smart contract concept.
What you see on the official site is now greatly outdated, most of the action is on github, forums/reddit &amp; IRC.
Vitalik addresses 'bitcoin maximalism' in some blog posts like [this one]( 
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:06:41
Blockchain is THE technology, Bitcoin is an Application (with very very limited scripting language). Counterparty is essentially an hack to add some turing completeness, and of course it has no choice other than to use it's own coin (XCP), why does it need its own coin? because it can't be done on top of Bitcoin.
Blockchain =&gt; TCP; Bitcoin =&gt; SMTP; Counterpaty =&gt; Hack to make something work on SMTP when really what's needed is HTTP.
Note: that HTTP does not kill SMTP. They just serve different purposes. It makes sense to create different tech using Blockchain technology, It doesn't make sense to put everything on the top of Bitcoin. It's good for payments just like SMTP is good for emails.
@_date: 2015-02-14 01:44:25
do you deposit with interact?
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:38:31
Highly highly likely on its own blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain is first generation, made specifically for payments and will likely remain that way. For other applications you need a different blockchain, but for payments Bitcoin is pretty good at what it does.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:52:30
The problem is that the bitcoin blockchain is very limited, there is a limit on what you can do with it. It's great at what it does, the same way SMTP is great for email, but to try to do everything on top of it when clearly was not designed to do so, makes no sense.. I love Bitcoin btw I want it to succeed. I'm just not a fundamentalist about it,  It makes sense for other blockchain techs to be created to ensure the decentralization of the Web, there is more than enough space and it's not a threat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:12:22
Ethereum will be the best thing to happen to Bitcoin. They complement each other. Ethereum is not a threat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-17 13:09:32
Bitcoin and Ethereum complement each other nicely. The future is near!
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:13:34
Actually TCP is a transport protocol and SMTP an application protocol. A more accurate analogy is that the blockchain is TCP/IP and Bitcoin is SMTP. And SMTP is great for email, but you can't build Netflix on top of it.. It's far more efficient to create another protocol for that.
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:18:57
A second generation blockchain, which can be or not sidechained to Bitcoin. Examples: Counterparty, Ethereum, Nxt. (note: I don't consider these to be 'alt', an altcoin is a straight copy-paste fork of Bitcoin with barely anything new to offer).
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:11:47
If for you Bitcoin is all about making easy money fast then you are unlikely to like this.
Bitcoin introduced the Blockchain and a whole new world of possibilities in regards to P2P technology and all that it implies. If you like Bitcoin, its technology and its implications in society then you are likely to love stuff like ipfs and similar projects.

just to be clear, you expect Ethereum to:
1) have a market cap &lt; $30M (like NXT), or at most a marketcap 50x less than Bitcoin (like ripple)
2) dead community (unlike today)
Is that right?
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:40:07
Bitcoin has its own advantages (like being inflationary). You can do the IPO taking advantage of Ethereums smart-contract capabilities but selling the 'shares' as assets pegged to bitcoin so to have access to Bitcoins liquidity (There are startups developing this). Ethereum is very good at decentralized applications, and Bitcoin has a huge reach and branding in the real world, I don't see Ethereum taking over that so easily. But it does however expand the cryptocurrency space creating a further market for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-19 11:45:05
I think the word 'investment' is key here. Blockchain 2.0 cryptos are meant as platforms for development, not as an investment &amp; speculation vehicle. For the later, Bitcoin is very good at what it does and it's a great currency.
@_date: 2016-07-21 14:58:22
The main diff is that in the case of the dao the funds were locked in a specific address, so there was no need to revert transactions. That isn't the case with Ulbrich or Mtgox funds.
@_date: 2016-07-21 19:08:46
It was an hack not a rule of the system (and don't tell me "just followed the contract" because it was an hack). The choice was between destroying the platform or fixing this, and the consensus was to fix it.
If a bug was found again on bitcoin that allowed someone to assign themselves 50 billion bitcoins or steal from most accounts using some bug, then I'm sure the consensus of the community would be to do an HF to fix it rather than loosing the Bitcoin project itself... (and as you know, this exact situation has happened to bitcoin).
On top of that, IMO returning the money to all these people was the decent thing to do, it would be dishonest to pretend nothing could be done in the name of some puritan views.
@_date: 2016-07-21 20:51:28
It has everything to with it since only the content that fits a certain narrative is allowed, in your example, anything trying to clarify that analysis is removed, and anything agreeing it is kept, after a while you become 100% convinced of the narrative since you barely ever see anyone disagreeing.
@_date: 2016-07-21 15:56:45
(who is "You"?)
No transactions were reverted, the stolen ether was transfered to a withdraw contract. This is quite different from the mtgox theft which had something like thousands of transactions and subtransactions leaked over a period of time, and reverting that would be a real mess. It was very fortunate that the DAO had a fund lock period otherwise this HF would probably not have happened.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:10:55
