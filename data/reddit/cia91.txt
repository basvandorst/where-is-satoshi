I work with bank too and they talk more often about bicoin, also on the train i can hear people talking about that.
In the Italian Telegram chat we had a lot of new user these day, and the only italian exchange (whic is aso the oldes exchange in the world) the rock trading has stopped new account since the new user are too many.
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:57:37
Yeah they have finally.
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:22:23
Well, the online part is quite shitty, they usually report fake news or clickbait article, and as you know by they often look for news on reddit, wich is not what i will define good journalism.

But they can put all the transaction in one block after this 12h!!
So they can buy a coffee with very low fee, but they only have to wait 12h for confirmation.

I want to be in the 2.1 club sinche the 21 club is now unreachable.
@_date: 2017-08-29 10:33:58
It's a lottery ticket every 10 minute.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:14:50
I aim at the 2.1 club...

Yesterday i managed to install this in the windows 10 integrated linux bash, it's very easy.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:27:12
On what exchange they reached 3k €?
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:35:57
Also i think that bitcoin remain worth the same over the month (maybe even gain something), while fiat loose valuation day after day.
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:25:51
i was asking the same question...
@_date: 2017-08-17 06:57:22
Send link please, i think it's similar to wpa2 cracking right?
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:30:21
Nice, but as today i can't find some statistic on how big is the blockchain and how much daily data a full node willl use.
Why you don't extrapolate these data from your PI and put them on a live page in the website?
@_date: 2017-08-10 07:32:55
How the transaction fee is chosen? The customer choose it? This way he can put 0 as fee, and the payment will always stay in the mempool till it expire days later.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:28:31
Since there is not replay protection it's difficult for both chain to survive without any problem like BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:09:44
No, you have to pay tax on all gain derived from financial investment or money exchange, but if you have a loss you simply pay 0 taxes. Of course if you gain 1000€ from bitcoin but loose 200€ from another investment you net is 800€ and you pay tax on that.
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:24:32
Post proof.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:18:31
Hi, i'm from Italy. Here Bitcoin are legal and declared as currency, so you don't have to pay IVA (our VAT) if you buy/sell them, you only have taxes on the net gain at the end of the fiscal year.
Also Repubblica is a shitty newspaper.
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:00:00
Have you tried to sniff them? Because the code you are reviewing is very old, maybe now they have ssl...
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:14:05
Time for my review on Google Play.
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:09:43
I noticed today that Bitstamp has free withdraw, why i used kraken since today?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:23:21
Ahahah, probably the only one. Here in Italy if you want to pay a taxi with credit card you have to search for hours, because everyone want only cash so they can steal taxes.
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:04:00
Me too, 24 hour and it's not even at 50%
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:15:15
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:16:45
Ok, tnx.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:06:41
Yes, you just have to be carefull when you want to move them the first time.
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:05:39
But to start a pruned node you need to download the full chain? I can't find information on if it download it all and then remove the older block or just download the last fewer block.
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:09:20
Also intrested on how to sync with laptop
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:46:08
I tried it while it was still in beta. A good app, but i didn't really liked it at that time, but i don't use any token, so i can't really talk about that part.
I know that they are improving it and even a graphic redesign in scheduled soon.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:57:37
What you want to avoid is basically a double spend.
Ho to avoid it is quite difficult, tutorial will be written after the fork, now it's a bit early to discuss, since the situation is not yet clear.
Segwit2x code have now optional replay protection, so the procedure would be a little easier if implemented.
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:39:37
No, just wait and decide if you want to redeem the forked coin or not.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:08:36
i will definitly use it for my paper wallet, waiting for a better foldable version.
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:22:29
Italian here, if that will happen i will be here asking for some satoshi of charity
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:27:57
Since kraken is an exchange and not a wallet, and the withdraw fees are quite high, how do you suggest to use it? Keep online only the amount used for fast exchange and one in a time move the surplus BTC from kraken to an offline/other wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:44:58
I registered and got tier 1 and 2 verified in less than a week, received the tier 2 verification yesterday. Maybe the have 2 different team for us and eu?
