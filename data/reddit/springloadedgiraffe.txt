Ignorant - lacking knowledge or information. I'd say she is ignorant of bitcoin, like most people.

Goddamn that was painful to read. Why do people think they can just jump right into day trading with that big of a bankroll?

"PayPal" isn't a currency.

That latency though. I don't see reaction time based games being too feasible on a mesh network.

To be fair, they DID have a small market of completely legal items available in addition to all the illegal drugs.

Depends what kind of cert you want. There are literally hundreds, although which ones are worth the time/effort is debatable. Google is your friend. ["How do I get a cisco cert".](

It would work, but then you'd lose out on separate addresses for orders, which would help keep track of individual purchases.

I thought that way about a bunch of bitcoins I had lying around years ago. Ended up losing the .6 cent wallet. :/

Ignorant people are everywhere. *shrugs*

If you have an android (maybe they have it for ios too, idk) you can use bambuser. It streams the video to their servers so you can access it even if your phone is stolen from your hands while you're recording.

Not if the game didn't require beefy graphics processing in the first place. There are plenty of games that people buy that are ran off just the CPU.

Check out and Especially the sidebar of learnprogramming.
 is pretty neato. There are a few other sites out there like codeacadamy that you can find easily through the above links or google.

It's possible. We'll see in the next few months or years I guess.

There are three stages of verification on coinbase. 
Stage 0, you bought a bitcoin from them. 
Stage 1, it's been at least 30 days since you first bought a bitcoin and there were no issues with your account (like the bank you used to buy it reports the transaction as fraud. I.e. Theft). 
Stage 2 is ~~sending them a valid photo ID and~~ answering a few questions that (supposedly) only you will know the correct answers to. You can go to stage 2 as soon as you get to stage 1. With stage 2, your transactions are basically instant. Stage 2 verification is voluntary.
Edit: see posts below me.

There was a Chinese documentary a month (ish?) ago, broadcasted on the Chinese government sponsored news talking about bitcoin and is uses. And not like "BITCOIN BAD", just informative. So they are at least neutral about bitcoins, and not against them.
Otherwise it would be like the DEA in America making a documentary on the production and use of methamphetamine, a bit counterproductive.

Myspace used to be pretty heavily entrenched in social networking. Look at what happened there.

Thanks! And whoever made this video really likes Radiohead...

This is what i do. (If you're in the US)
Depending on your bank you can verify your bank instantly by giving them your login details (sounds sketchy, so i changed my password,  got verified, then changed it again no problem). 
Then you can buy up to 10 btc per day. They take 3-4 days to process, but whatever the price for a coin is at the moment you hit buy is the price you pay plus (&lt; $1) in fees. As soon as it hits your coinbase account you can transfer it to whatever wallet you want. They also cash out btc directly to your bank account.

You're underestimating what specific hardware can do.
Think of it like a boat prop. In its element, water, it does a good job moving your boat. If you put wheels on that boat and tried using that prop for wind propulsion, it would work but very poorly (flat land and all that, just work with me here). Or maybe you want to till your garden, the boat prop might kind of work for that, but neither of these uses will take advantage of the engineering that went into designing that boat prop to be used in water. 
Another analogy would be a jeep vs a formula 1 car. A jeep will go over pretty much any terrain at a modest jeep speed, but the formula 1 will race the shit out of the jeep... as long as it's on a race track.

About the only place you can just walk into and trade your gold for goods is a pawn shop. Bitcoins are spendable. Granted the locations you can spend them are fairly limited right now, the number is growing by the day.

Whats the time frame that divides legal and illegal transfers? As in, how long must I wait between each withdrawal of $9,000 for it to be legal?

The government is who was responsible for that nice documentary on bitcoins airing. They wouldn't so that if at least they didn't care. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 21:22:37
I'm looking forward to being able to get cash out when I want to. This looks awesome so far!
@_date: 2013-06-26 00:37:16
Yeah. But do you think something that the government was against would be airing on a state-run television network?

What if you were to color over the labeling and list the item simply as a double SHA-256 hashing dongle?
"For all your double SHA-256 hashing needs..."

There has to be a time frame... Otherwise every time my deposits totaled up to $10,000 USD I would be arrested.
