It is more significant for leading numbers. But it still applies. Also psychology might play a big role for certain trailing digits getting traded more likely.
Anyway, my post is not supported by any data and I would be happy to see some actual frequency analysis of bitcoin prices.

If bitcoin needs 99% consensus for changes we can call it a day and it will be the end of any evolution in the code base.
And if 60% agree to double the number of bitcoins then they will be able to do that. Even though 40% disagree. The name 'bitcoin' would most likely stay with the majority.
(Not saying that it would be possible/easy to get a majority to change the number of bitcoins; It is interesting to see my posts being ideologically downvoted)

This stuff hurts my brain. Go buy some magnetic wristbands.

Obviously you don't understand bitcoin.
The original bitcoin has been changed many times by democratic majorities. The currently used bitcoin is significantly changed compared to Satoshi's first version.

Oh bitcoin old friend, you have changed.
Sad to see merchant adoption going backwards. Fortunately not everyone believes that bitcoin is just for banks.

Reference for what?

And you don't need to listen to random reddit accounts if you can make your own opinion.

This is terrible advice and against bitcoins privacy.
It would be similar to advice people to reuse addresses.

Posts like this are a reminder to do your own research and not blindly believe propaganda on the internet.
Except you like simple black and white world views. Then the previous post is awesome.

Of course it is important to know the number of active users. The total number of subscriptions is largely meaningless. Reddit accounts are cheap.

No, because usually it is not even known which address is a change address and which one is the one being payed. Consolidating outputs is against basic principles of bitcoin security.
Next we can start using only a single address per person. When we start consolidating addresses we can as well reuse old addresses.

Bitcoin is only scarce as long as 51% decide it is. A &gt;50% majority can do whatever they like with bitcoin.

Here is a link for people that want to make their own opinion:

How many of them are not banned? Serious question. Is there a way to get this information? 
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:22:27


That is bad advice if you don't want your transactions linked.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:06:40
Sure, but it links your transactions together.
It is like telling your coffeeshop about your pharmacy purchases.

Lol, twice the profit of Amazon in 2017? Guys, use your brain.
That would be more than the value of all bitcoin mined last year.
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:48:13
I am talking about a democratic &gt;50% majority.
You are probably talking about a &gt;50% hashpower attack. Huge difference.

Cobra abusing his power to spread FUD. As expected from his past.
Why would anyone care about this guy?

I am quite sure the digits of bitcoin price are not random.
