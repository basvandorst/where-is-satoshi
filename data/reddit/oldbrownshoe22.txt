deflation can be damaging, googling "deflation risk" contains results, although I'll admit they aren't as seemingly devastating as inflation risks (however, this could be partly due to widespread and significant deflation of a major currency never happening).
Ignoring that, my main point concerns the mysticism of bitcoin and the oversimplification and crudeness of using the current Venezuelan crisis as something that bitcoin would have averted. 
edit: also, how does bitcoin's divisibility deal with wealth disparity/inequality?

Not saying same problem. Saying bitcoin wouldnt stop an equivalent evil, for example hording

How divisible is bitcoin? Asking seriously, what's stopping it from getting fractionally smaller in the same sense as Venezuelan money is hyper-inflated?
Also, not a hater, but for bitcoin to work for these poor people, it has to be accessible by them...

I dont think that's true. Ban it, tax it, control it? Sounds like a daft punk song.
Maybe not on a global scale if that's what youre saying, but preventing it from being used in Venezuela seems possible to me.

It seems obvious to me though, that even if bitcoin was widely used in Venezuela, it wouldn't stop a quasi-dictator from going on a rampage to destroy it. If he saw bitcoin as disrupting his power, he would try to undermine it. So now I guess this is where you argue in that bitcoin would prevent that or something, but that would be equally speculative and I would think wrong, which is why the imagery that spurred my comments irks me. When a group thinks their thing would solve a huge problem it leads to something like idolatry or myth

Sure, I understand inflation and deflation, I get what you're saying, but my point is one of equivalent evils. Also, I dislike .gifs promoting bitcoin as essentially mysticism (like bitcoin would have prevented what has happened there). 
To start, it ignores the political and social context that led to the real issues going on there. Bitcoin would not have changed wealth disparity, authoritarian behavior by madmen, corruption, or how oil companies operate. 
I'm probably being too serious though.

Bitcoin advocate/core developer and some irish PhD guy- 2 (experts). 
One guy thinks it's next dolla dolla bill, other guy thinks it's a ponzi scheme or like tulip bubble, whenever that was, can't remember off top of head- I think 20's.
If Bitcoin actually goes anywhere, governments will respond, because their currencies will be threatened. Banks will respond, because their institutions will be threatened.
Guy 1-"Bitcoin has created a firestorm of excitement throughout the world because it's a new financial system, designed from scratch by the people, for the people.
It's not only fast, cheap and easy. In Bitcoin, every participant has equal power."
Guy 2-"The "money 2.0" stuff is just marketing, and has been tried before, in the US in the 1850s during the free banking period, for example."
