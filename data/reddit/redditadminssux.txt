The way that the market prices in the lastest news and info into BTC is weird. Dont expect too much rationality in the short term market price, even from LN.

Gotta give us a link or something. Cant just say something like that and not give a source

Just for fun, let's guess at something: In a month, which do you think will have a higher market cap, BitConnect Coin or Bitcoin Cash?

Bitcoin isn't really something you can buy coffee with, at least not right now. Its more like a slower Paypal ATM

Do you really think OP is being serious? If so, I have an ICO I'd like to sell you

The other cost of doing a fancy strategy is the opportunity cost of having the assured* gains of appreciation of Bitcoin value. Thus you might not only lose money playing the timing game, you're also forgoing a fairly assured* strategy of buying and holding.
\* Results not guaranteed, unless you're a true believer ;)

Bitcoin is life

If you buy the Bitcoins from an exchange then transfer them to a private wallet (like Electrum, paper wallet, etc) then you'll be fine. As long as you have time to do that, you'll be good.

1BTC == $3352
My rationale is thus: Here as of July 1st 2017, more than 85% of hash power is signalling for Segwit2X. I think that most miners will indeed signal for Segwit. Political shenanigans and NYA signatories going back on their word is possible, but not as likely IMHO.
As a result, Segwit will be locked in and be part of BTC. As of Sep 1, there will still be a political battle ahead with the prospect of a 2mb hard fork, and this will cloud the future and drive down price. However, there will also finally have been a significant step towards scaling taken. Transaction fees will be reasonable. The market will look favorably at this on the whole and push the price up to all time highs.

Da heck is "bitcoincash"? Is it a shitty altcoin?

No, but he *is* Nakamoto

I'm from the bleak, apocalyptic far-future, and I just bought my first bitcoin today for 10 million liters of petrol. Hopefully I'm not to late to the game before the human race is extinct.
