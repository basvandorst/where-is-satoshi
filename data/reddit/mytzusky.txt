Enjoy the whole 2% lol... 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:12:14
I'm fairly new in the space... do they pull this "LN is coming" each time ppl complain about the fees ? They got worse by month... its almost like I feel my money captive.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:59:17
I'm sorry for you.. we measure profits in x here... not %.
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:42:14
I bet he watched 'Dark' - I started questioning things for sure :D
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:12:19
Because there's already 80% on the market and maybe is too much ? see what I did there?...
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:54:09
I'd have a question too : are you forced to use a node, to be able to use bitcoin any longer in LN ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:02:09
Why suddenly the store of value excuse is valid... bitcoin was not advertise as such on the long way that got us here... not even sure the majority of users sees it   like this.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:57:21
And I cant even reach 1 full btc yet.
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:09:53
Yes, it isn't.
@_date: 2019-03-14 09:07:34
and now imagine being them, you find your hope in BTC, then -90% happens. poor guys. recommending btc as a solution to their crisis seems like a bad freakin joke.
@_date: 2019-11-23 10:12:02
look guys there's were your money are in case you wonder. you keep hodling though lol
@_date: 2019-03-17 00:21:10
96% in 100 years, give bitcoin few months.. :D
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:00:33
\*is it though?\*
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:02:18
no /s but I think that already happens. We complain that there's no new ppl coming in, but I think we slowly loosing the ones in.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:25:52
if you think about it the hodl meme, is a perfect tool in a 'ponzi-like' market like crypto, or 'emergent'/'low liquidity'/'evolving', anything that makes you feel better than 'ponzi-like'.
@_date: 2018-06-23 10:18:50
June is already on the other side, stripping what you have...
@_date: 2019-08-21 16:13:31
If fiat goes away that btc adoption is gone, do you see the problem now ?
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:14:48
Why ? Did someone sent you money by mistake, asked a refund, and you got left with paying the transactions fees anyway ? ah ok...
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:44:42
18 months ago...
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:33:36
friendly reminder, don't fomo.

He's living on planet Murica.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:22:31
The title and the first paragraph contradict each other... didnt read the rest.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:00:47
It went down 90% in the past years. Yet it always come back up on the long term.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:02:59
I dont get forks... they blame banks for printing money when this is exactly the same.
@_date: 2019-04-12 17:49:05
Smth pay ... nfc payments with the smartphone/smartwatch.
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:36:53
let's talk again in December...
@_date: 2019-04-03 12:56:15
Of course these guys will dump soon, the ones that are in for the long run will accumulate smart.
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:40:08
everyone needs to learn this the hard way, hodl is just a manipulative meme for noobs.
@_date: 2019-04-26 20:12:58
No, I mean that then, we will be comparing to the 20K bitcoin from december 2017.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:39:18
Could that happen on a power loss too? It'd be pretty scary.
@_date: 2018-03-24 08:51:01
he's still hodling
@_date: 2018-11-11 09:30:20
Do you even read the graph ? Or just holding bags
@_date: 2019-01-01 02:46:13
look at him, he doesn't.
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:30:19
I'd rather have my money back lol
@_date: 2018-03-25 19:37:37
Tell that to the guys that came in december
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:06:23
You can't fork gold, the limited supply and the distribution can become an irrelevant joke anytime.
@_date: 2019-09-06 10:38:14
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:31:46
yeah they are dying of all the wait... I can see the lines from here...
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:00:15
A 5$ investment in bitcoin in dec 2017 would be worth 2$ today.
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:23:28
not long ago we were moving 57 cents for millions in fees lol, neverforget.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:13:32
two years later and we did nothing to improve this ? why is LN not helping, is it about adoption or the LN is not viable ?
