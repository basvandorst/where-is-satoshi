Has anyone actually had issues with used trezor wallets though? I'm struggling to find an instance.  Maybe we are all just being too cautious, after all any attempt at opening the device will be obvious and the software/firmware can all be wiped/reset.

haha I know, I have yet to find an example!

this is honestly how I see it, once the device arrives I'm gonna take a good look over it to check for physical interference and then perhaps just go for it. I've emailed the seller my concerns and he seems like a genuine user of bitcoins who just sold up recently and is getting rid of his now unneeded device.

Agreed... Oh well you live and learn.

I'm an idiot? Was unaware, sorry, new to bitcoins :(

It wasn't until i watched some youtube reviews that I got concerned. :(

surely any tampering on the software side of things will be undone on a fresh install of the firmware though? Also by all accounts, trying to open up the device will leave obvious tamper marks so once it arrives i'm gonna inspect it thoroughly and put my mind at ease.

Fuck thats a lot more than I expected

Your right of course, I dunno i'll probably end up selling it on but I can't help thinking theres nothing actually up with it. I know your right...
@_date: 2019-07-04 19:45:19
I know, I'll likely sell it on but can't shake the feeling it will be fine!

Pulled mine of last week, huge relief I can tell you.  You just never know.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:37:22
I'm gonna inspect it on arrival then make up my mind. The seller seems to genuinely be done with the device after selling his btc recently.

I'm HODLing til 2028 at the earliest!

Just got the email... do i need to cash out completely? will i lose my btc after september if I dont?
Edit: duh please ignore, my btc are in coinbase not circle pay. I don't really touch my btc and panicked there for a minute!

I have looked into this in the past but it looks like a heck of a lot of work that I'm scared to screw up. Having said that I really should go back and take another look, storing btc offline seems the best way to go I agree. Got any pointers?
