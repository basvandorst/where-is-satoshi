Full disclosure: currently, mostly hodling ETH.

Not discounted...marked up.  But I still hurt myself.

Bought my first Bitcoin @ $129.  To some, there's jealousy.  To others, there's laughter!
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:49:20
You're welcome!  :)

PercentEvil=100   Nicely done!

No, it doesn't...Apple will continue to suck!

I set my fee to .0001, and immediately noticed that my transactions took a bit longer to propagate.  If time is of the essence, I'd suggest leaving the fee at the default .0002

Absolutely...this is an advertisement/infomercial/scam

My life is working with enterprise software applications. I completely get it that in a rush to accept Bitcoin, they may not have had things fully buttoned up at launch.

Not a good idea.  davotoula is correct...it's way too easy for a scammer to take your coin, and then reverse the PayPal transaction.

Excerpt: "Johnson described the cryptocurrency-purchasing demographic, stating that they “tend to be male and buy twice as much as those paying with regular currency.“ Johnson added that “people paying with cryptocurrency don’t buy anything drastically different from other customers.”"

You're funny.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:51
And yes, you say Hodl like yodel.
@_date: 2017-11-19 13:46:35
Crypto in one hand, some kind of 2nd amendment device in the other!

1. Venezuela's subsidized electricity (virtually free) makes crypto mining extremely profitable.  Does that push up price?
2. Gold and silver  used to be the traditional hedges against hyper inflation...is crypto now the best hedge?

Hmmmm.  I'm guessing that oil @ USD1000 per barrel may have some impact on the price of crypto...
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:17:54
Correct!  We are serious AF.

Said Bitcoin to Jamie Dimon: "How do you like me now!?!"

I’ve been using “yodel” based on the pronunciation of the root word, hold.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:44:17
awesome handle, BTW
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:20:12
But, as a Believer, I know today's investment will be worth 10X that by the time I retire, so doesn't that make today's 20% "fee" moot?
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:34:03
I'm gonna hodl on to that post...it was a doozy! Nicely done.
