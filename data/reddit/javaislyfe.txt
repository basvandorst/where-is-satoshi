Does cashapp act like an exchange and report (to the IRS / Gov’t) your buys and holding?  Say, if someone send me BTC to my cashapp instead of trezor, is that reported? Or if I move my own monies around from trezor to cashapp, is that now seen as some income? Ty

Write a contract between yourself and your friend for the bought at purchase price.... saying Friend bought X amount of BTC at X value, and that transaction from the exchange. 
Have the BTC value Xbtc sent to your wallet.
Have your dad pay taxes - friend has document to show it was a transaction. Gift friend 1 or 2% for helping you out.
Otherwise, it’s still your friends coins, and he can just give your dad the original FIAT back.

But the same flucation goes if I had sent btc to their wallet. I’m assuming some small venders might like this - because they can easily accept btc, feels like paper money, and then they can research and set up their wallet at a later time. It’s also a little bit of a “reward” feeling, because they see the btc logo - and they can touch it.
Same goes for currencies that are devaluing.

If you want in, go in. Ask questions &amp; research.

Hi,  welcome. Coinbase is very safe. The challenges are when the exchanges are overwhelmed and you are having trouble logging in.
You do not need to buy a full coin.
Anything over 1k you might want to consider getting yourself a hardware wallet and transfer your coins there. There’s the phrase “not your keys, not your coins”. Coinbase and other exchanges hold the keys to your coins, until you actually transfer them off of the exchange.
Good luck &amp; hodl!!

This just made me think.... I wonder if I printed out a few paper wallets - as though it was paper currency.... $5, $10 and $20 on them and tried using it as “cash” at a local store / market - if they would take it.  I bet it’d be easier for people to get it. 
Then they can scan and save it in their wallets later. Something familiar for people....
Edit: but I guess people could do this and the wallets are empty ... k, I just talked myself out of the cool idea.

I see it as adoption. Bitcoin is technology. Snapchat came out as a sexting app. Then people saw funny filtered photos of friends looking like sexy dogs, or reindeer... popping up. People didn’t fully get Snapchat - but it spread, it became a community, the community was seen as valuable - and businesses adopted. BTC is a currency, anonymous messaging app, an international community - money. It takes time for people to understand new tech, yes, I made a fkin Snapchat reference.

This was incredibly useful. I’m unsure if I can get my local grocery store to change, but the debit card can handle temporary issues (even though you’re not a fan). I can take the time to really look for BTC accepted here. Kinda like a treasure hunt. If you think about it, you don’t need to buy a lot of stuff. I read that as soon as you buy something w/ bitcoin you need to report the gains. Am I making this up on my head? 
Landlord, no problem. I’m living as an expat right now, and touch my US money is a huge pain in the ass. I get flagged all the time when I try to transfer between accounts - and my monies are held up for a few days. Also, many places here prefer cash. I had to change my way of living / thinking already. I’m not going to close my accounts, but I am def interested in making my btc wallet my main checking account. Granted to don’t have as much btc as many of you - but I also don’t have a lot of $ either. I’m seeing this as a personal choice and possibly economic / social experiment.

You can technically “buy” a second citizenship by getting your “golden visa”. In some countries, Spain being one of them. If you purchase a home for over €500k (research yourself, for the  might have changed). You can get yourself on the path towards residency and then citizenship.  Next, find a person who wants to sell their home for bitcoin.

Understood. I saved for the wallet, only because the idea of a paper wallet isn’t durable for me (ripped, lost etc.) just know yourself and what you can work with. Each person is different. Nothing is gospel. There are software wallets like electrum too. The thing is, if are going to eventually investing in bitcoin set aside € to get a wallet. €10/ mo in 9 months you got yourself your wallet. There ya go.

Im very curious how this happened, to help others not find themselves in a similar situation. Granted, this article could easily replace bitcoin with the word cc, or bank account. These things do happen in public WiFi

@_date: 2017-11-24 13:19:01
Thank you. I understand for stealing CC and data info. As well as maleWare for keystrokes .... My understanding was, if you used a hardware wallet, they would need the physical wallet, attached to the computer. If they  are using a software wallet, wouldn’t the thief need the seeds to clone the wallet? My only other thoughts is that the guy had it on a website / exchange, where a username &amp; password (maybe cellphone?) is needed.
Still trying to imagineer this scenario.

My folks talked me out of gold and Apple back in 2002. I didn’t know how to buy, and I needed their help. They tried to do the same about BTC, learn from their advice mistakes and find ways to do for yourself. They are education you, even if it’s to caution you against your own intuition / investments. In the end, they are amongst the crowd that has you double checking your inner voice - and see if you’re really motivated to do for you. Don’t be down, keep asking questions &amp; learn for yourself.

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:24:52
Or I find a different exchange ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:14:39
Welcome! I’m unsure of working to receive bitcoin - but I’ve read others who have done this, and there are websites dedicated to that. You can check through the sub.
You can buy bitcoin from Coinbase, Gemini, etc. It takes a few days to get verified.
Afterwards, and when you’re comfortable you can move your coins to a hardware wallet - like trezor or nano ledger. There are also software wallets, and paper wallets. I am most comfortable with hardware wallets - but you can do research on what works best for you.
There are software wallets like electrum. I used that for a time, but found the UI (user interface) to be outdated / aged. When things look confusing easier to make mistakes.
Start small, get use to things, then increase your buys / investment for what feels most comfortable to you.  
Keep asking questions, and researching .... and most important, welcome and Hodl. :)

How could this happen? The didn’t explain - aside from public WiFi. If I’m using my hardware wallet connected to my laptop on a public WiFi (I wouldn’t actually be doing this, but ....)  could that happen?
If someone is using their iOS / Android wallet on a public WiFi could it happen? If im on a company network - could it happen?
Just wondering what you think he did, to cause this. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 13:24:26
Then the author could write, bitcoin got lost in transaction. Maybe, ..... If the bitcoin left the wallet, I’d say the receiver lost out on the bitcoin - not the sender.

Hi, could you explain this? or point to an article on how to sell back for BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:17:42
Ah okay - I'll read up on the splitting software.
Thank you for the conversation. I'm really enjoying learning more about this world. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:27:33
I got myself set up with Trezor. I did a test run w/ Electrum. I'll most likely use a combination of the two.
Lazy as in - I read that you have to split the coin yourself if you use a HW wallet? Or, perhaps that was earlier in the day. I'll find out soon enough on my own.
I'm reading now about the Replay Attack, it seems that the best way to avoid losing your coins is to not use the network after the miners / developers are done w/ the fork and the network is more stable. Am I correct in that assumption?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:14:31


Ah great, yeah - I understand the fork, it's like (or exactly like) making a branch in a codebase. The idea of selling the new coin back is what I think is interesting. I get code. I was following BTC since 2011 - and snoozed on all of it; because I didn't understand the concept of a paper wallet. I still don't get the concept of the paper wallet, but there's articles on that too....
Thanks :) So if I have a HW wallet, after the fork I will have 2 coins, and I can take the shitcoin and sell it back? Could I do that in Coinbase or do I have to do that through a proper exchange?
@_date: 2019-09-10 17:10:59
Ah, thank you. At first I thought that had to do with paper wallets.
@_date: 2019-09-10 15:30:32
Can you explain "paper trade"
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:27:48


can you explain how Bakkt influenced this?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:59:06
that's the thing I find confusing. If coinbase is supporting both - why not keep your coins on CB? I'm still very new to this, but I read a lot and def. don't like the idea of keeping my coins on a site that would be a target. The odds of someone attacking my wallet is much lower than someone trying to attack all wallets on coinbase. Plus the whole, "not your keys not your coins." .... but if I were lazy, and I also can be ... why not send coins to the coinbase wallet and have them do the work?  .... Thanks for the reminder, I'll make sure not to make any movements around the time of the fork.
I'll go read about replay attacks now :)
