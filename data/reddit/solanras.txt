Why did you say "even"? Is there any exchange services better rates or commisions than 247exchange?

Thanks for the advice. Actually I trade bitcoin and to buy bitcoin in BTC-E, the only option for me is OKpay and to deposit in OKpay I need to use Wallet One. I don't totally trust OKpay but it is ok I guess according to reviews but Wallet One... There is nothing about them as I see.

Yes but I trade, I am not a long time holder. I mean I need instant transactions, not deposit and forget it for years. For someone who earn BTC as a wage and use BTC for their all spends it is a safe and good project to use. For trade, it seems not necessary.

I tried it and see only 10 people online average. So I think it is far away being a method to buy btc for now even it is a useful project.

Wallet One is not a bitcoin wallet. It is just my way to buy a bitcoin and also by saying "deposit" I mean I deposit money there and when it is arrived to account I will transfer it, I am not planning to keep money there, just try to find out are they trustworthy to use as a money transaction path, because I see nothing about them while searching, posivite or negative. I know that it is not logical to keep your money in somewhere else other than your personal bank account. Good warning video though.

I see that if you are not in SEPA, then you cannot buy btc from btc-e without paying high commissions. So it is waste of time and energy to try it no matter it is a wallet or exchange service, commissions are not acceptable.

I took a look, now downloading and will get into details. But it seems it is a software version of localbitcoins if so rates will be not good for me. Anyway, I will look into it more. Thanks.

Well, I was looking for swift for a while and the commission is kind of unclear because of the banks. You know the first bank and last bank commission but the correspondent bank's commission is hard to know. I will try it, if all commissions will be around 50USD, it is not too bad for big amounts. Thanks for the useful advice.
