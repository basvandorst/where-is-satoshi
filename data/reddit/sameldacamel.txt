Okay sure. I get that. But here's the thing, as far as I can tell there is more or less no way to use the internet in total privacy. And to be honest I trust Coinbase with my info than I would most company's. The other thing that I take into account is the fact that this is a donation to an extremely important company that millions use on a daily basis. What's more important to you?
(Not super sure of this, but I'm also fairly sure that you could just lie about everything they ask you for.)

Tried pinging google.com and it worked. As for the update, I installed it today...

This is a huge step towards large scale adoption!

Okay question. When I enter sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip
I get as far as when it asks me yes or no to install. Then when I hit y it just sends a bunch of 404 errors. It can't seem to find the webpage. Any ideas? I  also checked the Electrum webpage and it had the same commands.

Thanks man 1 butter @_date: 2014-12-01 17:43:11

Here is a Wikipedia article about it! 
People are saying that this may not apply to Bitcoin. I am just noting a trend with the charts.

I'll find a Wikipedia artical when I get home!
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:50:59
I know that those are things but I was hoping for a Bitcoin alternative.

Thanks for doing the mate!

As I am writing this the price is at 352.52$ according to the Coinbase app on my phone.
If you look at the charts of the price for about the last month the price will drop to about 320$ or lower and the run back up to near 400$. This in of itself is pretty interesting, but if you look at some investing theory you will see that a pattern like this is common in a lot of stocks. What it will also tell you is that after a stock makes this pattern three or four times in a row, the top price will become the new bottom price, and the value will rise. This is not to say that Bitcoin should be treated like a "normal" stock, or that this theory is always correct, but from what I remember of the charts (can't look at them right now) this drop is the third or forth dip in this pattern.
Don't know 'bout you guys but I'm buying...
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:33:08
I was under that impression for a while. Could someone link me the official one? Or am I a dumb ass and there isn't an official one?
@_date: 2014-10-30 21:43:47
As far as I can tell you don't seem to be schizophrenic or megalomaniac but is right, that would be awful. The reason that Bitcoin is important is because it is anonymous, which Paypal is not. Also Paypal is about a secure as your trash can...
Lastly, if you are looking for a "tap to pay" app, there are Bitcoin wallets for Android that do just this.
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:25:29
Could you give us a price point for this product?
@_date: 2014-11-04 13:39:33
Tipping as soon as I get home!
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:43:41
I agree. 100-200k seems reasonable...

What's so great about cash?
Well you can spend it right as soon as someone gives it to you.
What's bad about cash?
The bills are stored in a sort of dangerous way and are easily destroyed.
What's so great about plastic?
You don't have to carry cash! No counting, you just have to swipe the card and it's done.
What's so bad about plastic?
The person you pay using plastic doesn't get the money right away. Your account is dependent on a system that you have no control over, meaning your money can be stolen or denied to you. There are fees everywhere you turn.
What's so bad about "normal" currencies?
They can be created by a government as they see fit. They are extremely susceptible to inflation. They are insecure and they aren't worth anything to some people.
What's so great about Bitcoin?
Like cash, the person who is reciving it gets it almost instantly.  Like plastic you just have to scan a QR code, or tap a NFC(I think that's what they are called). Unlike cash you don't have to carry around anything, just your phone or hardware wallet. Unlike plastic there arn't any fees, and you are in complete control of your money. It cannot be deneyed to you. Lastly, it is secure! You are under control of your coin as long as it is stored on your hardware.
A lot over 100 words, but Bitcoin is pretty hard to explain in even a 1000 words...

It would just piss them off and get changetip ban.

Not true. Based on the previous instances of PayPal hackings I'm not sure Bitcoin "noobs" getting their coins stolen would do much for our image. Also, it is extremely important that Bitcoin aren't all held by one company. The reason Bitcoin is so secure is it's spread out.
@_date: 2014-11-01 04:25:43
That's much better than mine...
@_date: 2014-12-25 21:10:56
Thanks mate!
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:56:37
That's true. People have been saying though you could just enter bullshit info. It's not as if they have anyway to check.
@_date: 2014-11-12 21:07:47
There is an interesting trend reciently where it goes up to about 400-420ish and then drops to mid to low 300's.
@_date: 2014-12-09 21:21:20
After reading the artical more closely you are right, the 3-4 number that I threw around isn't mentioned. So I looked a bit more and I couldn't find anything to support that number.
Sorry about that...
However, if you read the Wikipedia article/ this one ( it will talk about how on a upward trend the resistance will become the support after a small rise in the old resistance. What I'm trying to say is that the longer this trend goes on the more likely the current resistance will become the new support.
@_date: 2014-11-06 19:28:50
I'm not so sure. Long run we don't need bubbles. What we need is steady growth from normal adopters.
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:40:46
I try to explain it like this. Think of how debit works and think how cash works. Now take away all of the problems with both and you get Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-16 16:36:28
I don't understand. You are worried about Coinbase using your information? Or you don't want to donate to Wikipedia? You seem to be implying that Coinbase is somehow trying to scam you, but this donation link is on the Wikipedia Foundation webpage.
EDIT: Yes I have tried! After you enter the info you get the address to send to.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:02:03
I agree. The government is so crooked at this point that there is no such things as an over reach for them. Who would stop them? The UN? What would they even do?
@_date: 2014-10-19 14:57:34
Hook me up?
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:31:31
It's novel because of the way it works. It acts like cash, but seems to transfer like debet or credit.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:48:42
This is the question. Some people think hold because it will rebound after the initial sell off. Some people think sell because it will not rebound. Judgement call.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:58:18
The moral of the story is... The only way you lose is if you sell.
@_date: 2015-03-16 00:50:53
That's a lot of money! Thanks for doing the right thing.
