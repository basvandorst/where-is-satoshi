In deed, but my point here is the amount of BTC I'm giving away, I don't want to spend more than 0.2BTC. If $3,000USD=0.19BTC I'm ok with it. Maybe in a few months $3,000USD=0.1BTC, who knows.

3 days ago I was 0.13BTC and sold everything to XRP. Now Im at 0.22BTC. Bitcoin's bull is done...

Agree. Learned that back in July with the 3k to 1.8k drop. I panic sold at 2.5k only to see it rise to 5k by August and then it dropped to 3k again and I told myself "is now or never" and made a huge investment at 3k. I don't regret it at all. This dips are like a pattern but we are yet to see another 40% drop like back in september. I want to see everyone here remain calm with a 16k to 10k (or more) dip.

Tell me about it. I remember just watching red charts on my screen in the office, couldn't focus on my job. But like you said, 2012 and 2014, people killing themselfs can't even imagine that. I'd say, at the moment, all cryptos (not only bitcoin) are a russian roulette. I been with ETH and XRP also through 2017 and I must say I'm so glad I'm a very patient guy...

Hope you took the advice not too late, see you on the moon.

I agree with this,  I hate working 9+ hours a day though but working in the oil &amp; gas industry is very demanding. The system might not be the best, my bosses sometimes might be a pain in ass and there will always be incompetent people to deal with, but I meet my deadlines, I do a good job and life goes on. I don't get paid well, no paid overtime, almost no vacations either (sorry no 1st world country) but everyday I learn a lot and most of all there's a discipline behind it, and I enjoy it. I don't consider myself a slave, I can quit at any given time and travel for a year but what is the point? I feel the need to give something back to society, pay my taxes, buy from the local store, share ideas with my colleagues, have a beer with friends (by the way only 2 or 3 out of 30+ friends complain about their jobs). I can even go as far as to say that having no job is depressing. Plus, I get a paycheck so I can keep investing 10% of it into BTC and eventually I will retire a lot sooner than I thought.

So basically you applied all your Christian "religion" (which I like to call a "Sect") nonsense and convinced everyone around you to trust their investments to you, wow. Yeah, you really do deserve to have your life ruined.

I took an advice from a thread i read here, set yourself a "goal" for the profit you want to make, hold your BTC or any other crypto until that "goal" has been reached and get out. Most people are in to pay debts, that is the truth, fortunately there are some of us who are just betting on the right horse. You want to be a millionare and never work again? then set yourself that goal; you want to buy a house? hold until you can afford it and so on. It will save you lots of headaches.

That is a very good question and I have no idea but I assume they adjust BTC to USD and bill it. Nevertheless I'll ask directly with the company.

You don't need to be an engineer to understand numbers and hard analytics.

It's just an advice, he's a day trader and for you too since you already read this. I'm still going back to holding BTC after XRP bulls are done by the end of January (by the time Korean banks end their tests), so I'm planning on selling the XRP  by mid-January. Easy money.

I'm looking to buy a Maingear Desktop PC with it, they accept bitcoin as a payment method. Just waiting for BTC to be back  and i'll buy it (Total cost around 0.18 BTC)

I set up a 10.3k and 10.5k alerts by midnight I went to bed. 7 hours after I had 34 notifications.

So what you are asking is if 1 bitcoin will be worth 1,000,000 usd in 5 years?

When stock exchanges cease to exist in the next great depression nothing will ever be manipulated anymore.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:57:51
Back in 2016 no one expected governments getting into crypto, nor stock exchanges. So to be honest, I find it hard to believe whales back in 2014 where manipulating the market. With the media all over it last year, things began to get weird and this subreddit suddenly was all about making money. I really don't care if BTC goes to 10usd, my investment was made a long time ago and it was insignificant, what ever happens I really don't care, I tried to to make a good thing for future generations.
Edit: no one here is crying
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:15:18
Market manipulation. All the big investors who didn't get into crypto in 2016-2017 are just driving the price down to get rid of the vast majority of regular people who got rich last year. This way they all buy low and get to control the asset for the future. Remember, if regular people sell, then who's buying a so called asset with "no value"? BTC will drop to 3,400 as a probable last support lvl, if not, 1,800 that's my best guess.

Plz sell your BTC so I can buy it. Thank you.

Not reading these kind of posts... also not caring about trading.
