Unfortunately for you, you didn't even use the right fucking logical fallacy. It's so obviously [this one]( I can't take you seriously in this thread anymore considering what you're arguing about:

You're quite good at projecting. "can barely write legible english" "made you so angry" "cry more" "use more bad words".. lolol I should just paste in your comment to reply to every ~~stupid~~ thing you say. (edit: redundant)
Oh no I lost all credibility with some dumbass on what ever will I doooooooo?

Soo... 550 BTC was more than a drop in the bucket of 126k?
Or did literally every source on the internet get the transaction amount wrong by an entire order of magnitude? Actually I'm inclined to believe you because if you truly had 126k BTC lying around somewhere, why the fuck would you go on reddit to peddle this stupid rambling bullshit?

I too come to threads and comment to tell people not to comment. 
Fucking idiot.

You've won me over. Obviously not stupid and your use of logical fallacies = exceptional. The privilege is all mine.

Oh shit, no way you found a typo. Probably because I was going to add the link at the bottom like you did and put it in line instead and forgot to change it back.
And they're not the same fallacy, or they'd be called the same thing and have the same definition. Good goddamn, this is the perfect example on why actual smart people get annoyed when dumbasses who took a junior college intro to philosophy class start spouting off about how wrong someone is because logical fallacy.
