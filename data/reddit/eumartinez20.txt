The problem is billions of dollars are being printed annually, so not a good store of value.
Get rid of it as soon as possible for Bitcoin :)
And by printing it, only a few get the benefit. They get to rob value out of your hard earned dollars.
They will loan that freshly printed money to you at a high interest.

What a load of crap.
We have all seen how miner software works. You can't just get developers out of the system and expect bitcoin's split power system to keep working.

Btc1 is 98% Core code. 
The two things changed do not work and made the fork stuck on testnet5.
Anyone can contribute to Core code or create their own software, miners just want to take over control. Good devs are not bribed with money.

How much money do you have in your bank account?
Some hodlers have a lot and others have little, it does really not matter as long as we hodl. Buy as much as you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:29:37
It would be OK if it was Segwit, not modified.
The whole purpose of this is to replace Core code (with new seeds to control where your node connects to, no test plan and a failed fork in testnet5 ;) )
Lets get Segwit and then work on 2mb with Core code...
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:26:30
I will have to get out my UASF cap out again??
Wasn't stored for long...
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:57:09
Check fees, I think they probably have a limit under which they stop adding txns per block
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:55:42
My guess is they have a fee limit, meaning they wont pick up transactions with a fee below 300sat/byte for example.
This will not make them lose a lot of money per block and would not help clear the mempool, so they can still complain about it ;)
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:49:44
Now we know why....ASICBOOST :)
@_date: 2017-04-17 06:02:34
Which also looks fishy as they post announcements on r/btc and take suggestions from BU devs....centralization sucks...
Any good page to track signalling?
@_date: 2017-04-24 11:41:07
All other miners are supporting Segwit
@_date: 2017-04-26 09:15:44
Yeah, let´s prove COVERT Asicboost.  [Antpool creates more empty block than any other pool]( 
Like someone said, I have condoms, lube and Viagra and you caught me naked in a room with a hooker but have no intent have sex (Also please don´t prohibit to pay for sex, it will be bad for hookers. And I only had sex with hookers in another country in which I patented brothels). 
There will never be any prove, I am smart enough to not need any more.
In any case if you believe they are not using it, lets block it (nobody should care)
@_date: 2017-04-21 10:31:35
Totally agree, bypassing steps makes the protocol less secure. It is an unfair advantage.
If they can complete the proper steps faster I am ok with that. If you make cars without doors you will definitely make more and faster.
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:54:34
If I leave the buns out when eating a burguer I can definitely eat them faster than you. By the time you eat 2 I probably ate 3 or 4.
It saves time (and thus power) if we both eat one burguer each.
If we are munching on burguers constantly (now I am hungry...) it does not save power at all as we can be doing it for the same amount of time, I just eat more than you. Right?
@_date: 2017-04-28 10:55:53
Hopefully it will not be a scam. It may just be Roger finding out he wants to be a powerful miner like Jihan.
It will all collapse once AsicBoost is blocked and mining profits get reduced. I understand banks won´t trust this risky business model and unsuspecting users money will be used for it.
In any case it does not look good and a lot of people will most likely loose a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-04-29 08:18:49
And now they replaced it with something else...I dont know if Roger is financing them, China is coercing miners or just the miners being greedy, but thekr actions are hurting Bitcoin. I am sure we the community will stop this at some point.
We just need to unite against this, we will have to often as many things will attack Bitcoin over time
@_date: 2017-04-19 10:20:17
They are paying the same for USED gear that will be delivered LATE and after an expected 30% difficulty increase by his wrongdoings. I would too cancel and let him have it.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:39:34
From 3 months ago, when everyone wondered what was going on with the empty blocks...Hitchslappy nailed it...
[Antpool, which holds almost 20% of bitcoins hashrate, is currently mining a large number of empty blocks. Co-founder Jihan Wu is also in favour of bigger blocks. What's going on? (i.redd.it)](
@_date: 2017-04-28 12:00:11
They are fully responsible of their actions and they should be held accountable. What they are doing would be punishable by law in regulated markets and in several western countries.
All the proof is pilling against them but you don´t want to see it, asking for more evidence as soon as evidence is presented to you.
Bitmain is running an evil monopoly trying to take over bitcoin and stall development for their own greed. But yet they don´t want to fork off as they know they will be the only ones mining a worthless coin.
Asicboost, Antbleed, blocking segwit, supporting and paying for developers to create BU (which is totally unstable and bug filled)...You can either believe something is going on or make up excuses, fine by me either way.
I agree Asicboost needs to be blocked. This will bring a stop to miner centralization and bring other manufacturers to the table.
@_date: 2017-04-18 11:47:19
Don´t let the smoke fool you. 
First we need to block asicboost. It is not an issue as they are not using it.
Once that is done Segwit will follow through.
@_date: 2017-04-28 11:32:03
They just can´t compete with Bitmain. Besides Acisboost, they do have cheap electricity and less costs.
Their customers are not individual consumers, but corporations and miners
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:03:45
Disabled once they tested Bitcoin Classic:
[While it is not uncommon for mining pools to report variable hash rates on a 24- or 48-hour basis, a significant drop is a rather unusual occurrence. In the case of Antpool, their share of the total Bitcoin network hashrate has fallen from 22% four days ago to 17% right now, and they are slowly being overtaken by BTCC pool on the charts.]
@_date: 2017-04-12 05:13:33
BW has also a long history of mining empty blocks and my gut tells me if they did not signal by now they may be Jihans little friends...
@_date: 2017-04-19 09:46:34
Defeating AsicBoost will cause Jihan to stop blocking Segwit AND it will reduce his power, leveling with all other manufacturers.
His whole plan is to stall any change, or postpone it as much as he cans while growing in power and control.
And they can´t complain as they are not using it. We need to rethink the strategy.
@_date: 2017-04-17 11:57:10
LOL, they are manipulating market OR
Jihan is slapping some renegade right now :)

Xt nodes and node counter are Roger's, just check the public service announcement that shows at the beginning. I use coin.dance instead

The link on coin.dance website goes to the r/btc post ONLY which is a clear indication of your support.
Andrew was just so lucky to support you internal discussion outcome...or was it the other way around?
What the heck is emergent consensus anyway? A confusing way of calling BitcoinUnlimited supporters? This and other changes you do seem to be aimed at supporting BU.
For example the biased weighting. Only facts and real data should be displayed on your website.
@_date: 2017-04-19 10:21:30
First we need to stop ASICBOOST to even out the ASIC manufacturer playing field.
Everything else (competition, SEGWIT) will soon follow.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:51:35
Adoption in Japan as a payment method since April 1st, also use in Nigeria, Venezuela and other emerging countries and the fact that the BU folks were stopping SegWit adoption for their own monetary gain!!!!
@_date: 2017-04-26 05:45:49
Your announcement was done on r/btc asking for suggestions on the change and you did not question any of the suggestions.
thezerg1Andrew Stone - Bitcoin Unlimited Lead Dev • 24d
I think that it would be great to see emergent consensus support separately from BU clients. Most parameters are optional in the EC signaling, "EB&lt;number&gt;" is really the mandatory one that indicates support.
Coin-Dance • 24d
It looks like this is the approach we're going to take.
@_date: 2017-04-18 11:42:47
Totally agree. AsicBoost is irrelevant for them and has nothing to do with the blocking of segwit, so let´s disable the advantage they are not using. Nobody should object.
Once that is done, Segwit on LTC and BTC will be easy...
@_date: 2017-04-27 18:48:04
Never a feature, never disclosed to their customers.
Not useful after used one time and people knows about it...and they are just disabling it now because they were caught!
@_date: 2017-04-12 07:06:09
I am so glad I was wrong! Go segwit!!!!
@_date: 2017-04-07 11:10:13
You are skipping part of the calculation needed, so I think it does as it allows to use that processing power somewhere else. It explains the sudden hashrate movements happening on their pool. Antpool hashrate decreased in the last days and it moves up and down frequently.
[While it is not uncommon for mining pools to report variable hash rates on a 24- or 48-hour basis, a significant drop is a rather unusual occurrence. In the case of Antpool, their share of the total Bitcoin network hashrate has fallen from 22% four days ago to 17% right now, and they are slowly being overtaken by BTCC pool on the charts.]
EDIT: Check also the hashpower on NODE COUNTER front page:
In the last 24 hours (144 blocks), Unlimited + Classic hashrate is **~1217 PH/s (33.3%)** of the total Bitcoin network (3651 PH/s).
In the last 7 days   (1000 blocks), Unlimited + Classic hashrate is **~1402 PH/s (38.4%)** of the total Bitcoin network (3651 PH/s).
@_date: 2017-04-07 12:08:26
It saves time, thus power IF you are doing the same amount of work.
If you are constantly working without stop you are able to calculate many more hashes than the rest, with the same amount of power.
@_date: 2017-04-07 09:29:34
This tweet is awesome and makes total sense now, right about the time when Jihan said his famous "fuck your mother if you want fuck", and nothing after Cinnabar´s post

How and where will the Chinese miners sell them?
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:23:59
There are multiple things wrong with the agreement
- No replay protection, so this means its a corporate takeover attempt and an attack to bitcoin. They don't want the market to decide how much their fork is worth so they will try to impose S2X upon everybody.
- Because of no replay protection users and companies will lose funds, creating confusion also.
- Mempool is empty
- Segwit2X meant messing with the code and adding corporate seeds? This tells your node where to connect to and is very telling (corporate takeover first step)
- Bitcoin can´t be controlled by 12 CEOs
- Power hungry miners want to control the protocol development also and this is just one more attack (XT, BU, Classic, ExtB, Parity,...) If miners control hashrate and protocol development the power balance will shift and Bitcoin will become a miner coin where users and the community opinion will be worthless. Pretty much like the dollar ;)
- Bitmain and Roger want the S2X fork to hurt Bitcoin price to claim BCH is the real bitcoin.
- If they want to fork away like BCH with replay protection that's fine, but trying to fork without consensus and to try to kill the legacy chain (or absorb it) is an attack.
- Buggy and untested code, no commits in 2 months. One paid developer only copying Core code. It will quickly become outdated and unmaintained.
- There are 200 btc1 nodes. You think you can upgrade 100k nodes in 2 months? Timeline is reckless and will definitely cause confusion.
There are probably a few more :)

@_date: 2017-09-27 19:59:45
Deflationary is good, it will make it the world reserve currency. This means other currencies will be backed by Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-29 13:15:50

No replay protection is just designed to mess with the current chain.
Replay protection would mean they become just like BCH, another worthless altcoin. S2X does not want that, they learned from that mistake. See email on top from bitcoin dot com
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:12:37
Large businesses, and sophisticated investors will definitely have miners to back them. I am sure they already have plans to make the original bitcoin chain survive, because the other forks are (and will be) altcoins.

Incorrect. 85% percent of nodes (Core and UASF nodes) did support Segwit.
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:28:48
There are no technical reasons at all for S2X, mempool is empty and blocks are increasing. Companies are adopting Segwit (not shapeshift, though) and saving on fees.

If corps and miners control the code forget about the 21mil cap, welcome corp seeds that will tell you where your node connects, forget about Core improvements and other thousands of ways to screw you and take your money. Bitcoin will cease to be Bitcoin and slowly die.
The want control and they dont see those short term increased profits will end up killing Bitcoin and converting it into JAA (just another altcoin)
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:33:34
Agreed. The moment they merged that, I started smelling something fishy too.
I believed their intentions were good up until that point. Furthermore, none of the signatories has even mentioned the seeds or replied to why they were included.
The reason provided on Github was to allow their S2X nodes to connect to other S2X nodes.
But then they complained when Core automatically disconnected them from their 0.15 release, even thinking of hiding their service bit to keep connected to Core nodes. 
This is only there to cause confusion in the network and effectively take over the Bitcoin protocol by not wanting a clean split.

I think the plan is to create something like USDT but for Yuan, so they control all transactions and are able to tax them.
BTC -&gt; CNYT -&gt; CNY
They may even create their own exchange...total control, perfect for chinese govt.

Nope, everyone wanted Segwit except Bitmain ;)
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:18:19
What they don´t understand is that they will loose a lot of business, reputation and maybe even their companies. It will hurt companies (all on both sides of this) more than hodlers and devs.
They may slow Bitcoin adoption for a few years with this messy fork (messy since they want to make it messy and take over the original chain) but we will return stronger than ever.
Honey Badger does not care.
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:25:26
**Still no answer regarding the corporate seeds or the replay protection...was that on the NYA agreement too?**
There are multiple things wrong with the agreement you recklessly support:
- No replay protection, so this means **S2X its a corporate takeover attempt and an attack to bitcoin**. They don't want the market to decide how much their fork is worth so they will try to impose S2X upon everybody.
- Because of no replay protection users and companies will lose funds, creating confusion also.
- Mempool is empty
- **Segwit2X meant messing with the code and adding corporate seeds?** This tells your node where to connect to and is very telling (corporate takeover first step)
- Bitcoin can´t be controlled by 12 CEOs
- Power hungry miners want to control the protocol development also and this is just one more attack (XT, BU, Classic, ExtB, Parity,...) If miners control hashrate and protocol development the power balance will shift and Bitcoin will become a miner coin where users and the community opinion will be worthless. Pretty much like the dollar ;)
- Bitmain and Roger want the S2X fork to hurt Bitcoin price to claim BCH is the real bitcoin.
- If they want to fork away like BCH with replay protection that's fine, but trying to fork without consensus and to try to kill the legacy chain (or absorb it) is an attack.
- Buggy and untested code, no commits in 2 months. One paid developer only copying Core code. It will quickly become outdated and unmaintained.
- There are 200 btc1 nodes. You think you can upgrade 100k nodes in 2 months? Timeline is reckless and will definitely cause confusion.
There are probably a few more :)

I feel the same way too, only the S2X reckless fork on the way now.

Not really, I dont care about BCH ;)

I understand Luke thinks blocks are quite big now and slowly new full nodes deployment, but understand block size could be increased in a year or so.

The link shows an example, feel free to change it
You can probably find out how it works :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:36:18
Already read it. Made sense in April, possibly no hidden agenda then :)
 - Same agenda after BCH?
 - After Jeff included corporate seeds in S2X code?
 - After knowing several signatories only want to remove Core and take over the protocol development?
 - After we all know code decisions are made privately and there is a private approval-only mailing list?
 - EDIT: After no replay protection?
You will be directly responsible for a lot of users and companies pain and loss of funds.
EDIT: Formatting, and thanks for taking your time to check reddit ;)
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:28:31
I did like Erik on the netflix "breaking bitcoin" documentary.
He seemed a smart guy helping bitcoin succeed.
Now the story has changed, he disregards the technical community to impose upon all users a change we dont want.
As there are no technical reasons for this fork, I can only assume a hidden agenda is behind this. This means the ultimate purpose for the S2X signatories is to remove Core devs from the picture and have control over the software.
The seed change is very telling on the btc1 code, that is the first step in any takeover attempt, trying to tell your node where to connect.
If this attack succeeds Bitcoin will be a failed experiment. I understand corporations used to have control over market, but they need to understand Bitcoin is worthless if anyone controls it.
They will kill Bitcoin for short term control and profits and we must stop this with all our will.
Thanks for the letter, failure to acknowledge you cant do a hardfork with complete consensus means they have hidden motives...and this is an attack on Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:40:18
They will buy now if they are smart :)
You will not see sub $4k Bitcoins in a couple weeks :)
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:20:52
I agree, even Luke posted something along the lines.
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:11:21
Ok, then I meant decisions are made behind closed doors by a restricted group of people. 
I am sure all reputable devs are eager to work in that manner
What I posted is not that bad, then ;)
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:52:44
It is, it avoided a hard fork and mempool is now empty.
That is how Bitcoin is supposed to scale, slowly but surely without creating splits or breaking all clients in the process.
That is why bitcoin price rises and BCH tanks. Same thing will happen to S2X coin and they know, so they have to attempt to take over the existing chain.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:53:34
Bitcoin will reach bubble territory at $5million per coin
EDIT: Anything below that is still cheap and undervalued :)
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:02:55


Funny, the only valuable coin would still be Bitcoin :)
S2xcoin with corporations controlling code will die quickly. Users being screwed while CEOs implement protocol changes.
and Cash is already on life support, one miner keeping it alive while loosing money and no users...
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:34:28
LOL...So you are assuming everyone supports S2X (signers and no signers) while not a single poll shows support for it?
Show me any devs or users supporting it
BTW, UAHF had no users, it was Bitmains attempt to keep Asicboost running (dropping today too)
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:37:21
Ideal would be everyone stops with the attempts to force things on people, and the community backs off the never-hardfork attitude.
Then we could continue working on a real hardfork, come to consensus on it within a year or two, &amp; deploying it safely w/ no split.
(In the meantime, BCH can keep doing their own thing, and provide a real alternative to people who dislike the direction of Bitcoin.)
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:57:18


I didn't hear or see that anywhere


Wut? Segwit is software.


Not needed, corporate takeover attempt, contentious hard fork,....Check price once it is called off
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:44:53
I highly doubt we will get there
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:44:32
Litecoin will remain the most honest coin after Bitcoin and will get many of the users.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:03:38
Miners and companies have more to lose from this contentious hard fork. It will be messy.
If they are smart they will all back down as soon as the first one does, in fact I think they are all waiting for the first guy.
Investors and Hodlers we dont lose much as we get both coins. Miners and corporations supporting this nonsense will lose their reputation and a huge user base. Alternatives will emerge.
Did you see the $4m bet between Roger and others? You think they don´t have a backup plan? Hashrate is mercenary, they will mine the most profitable chain like with BCH...
Of course this is just what I think ;)
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:31:22
I am sure the legacy chain will survive.
What he said is that S2X fork must kill Bitcoin to survive, not that it will ;)
S2X will become another BCH...kept alive only by miners losing money
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:37:53
Link? I have not seen anything official regarding exchanges yet...only mentioned ICOs
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:49:05
So the problem is Core devs will not implement the code miners want?
The power of Bitcoin is equally split between users, miners, devs and companies/exchanges. If miners and corparations control the code two things will happen:
1- Users will be screwed
2- Bitcoin will die and become an worthless altcoin. Centralized and controlled by few.
I support Core devs not letting that control happen, and also most of the community. Who is running btc1 code?
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:58:04
1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin always. Stable :)
Its deflationary, so it will never stabilize compared to inflationary FIAT.
Same thing as your dollars are worth 2-4% less each year, Bitcoin will always increase at least that 4% while compared to FIAT :)
Bitcoin is still a new concept not totally priced in, so I expect several years as adoption increases when price will increase at several hundred percents per year. 
After 5-10years price should stabilize and "only" increase 5-10% compared to FIAT
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:24:52
Psycho...scary too.
Why so much interest on this?
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:43:46
Hoping we won´t get that far.
Or screw these miners, POW change and get new ones :)
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:14:15
Miners developing code is much worse IMHO. Priorities.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:10:10
The original chain will not die.
Check the bets done with Roger to swap S2x to BTC coins by the smartest people of the community.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:56:51
Check these two, or the whole thread :)
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:12:25
I think they will try to "steal" f2pool miners if they don´t support Segwit2x
Is this just so they can use Asicboost?
They can use it already on BCC :)
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:58:52
**Agreed, it is open source.**
What I said is quite worrying and still true. Dont expect any good developers to work on that code where technical decisions are made by businesses.

Agreed, like BCH ;)

We will convince signatories this will kill bitcoin and hurt their businesses, maybe even destroy them. And their CEO reputation with it.
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:50:52
Nope, hashpower by design is mercenary and they will mine the most profitable chain. The Bitcoin design works.
The way I see it, by mining BCH most miners already broke the NYA agreement.
The current Bitcoin chain with Segwit (according to them, NYA activated it) is the S2X chain they agreed to upgrade (Segwit + 2MB HF)
They are already **not** supporting their agreement by not mining the Bitcoin chain 100% of the time. I dont see why they would stay on the S2X chain after the fork if the price does not follow.
And according to Bitfinex futures, S2X will be worth aprox. the same as BCH ATM.


See BCH. Unprofitable to mine, it may die soon. Hashrate does not matter if nobody uses it.
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:42:26
You seem to focus in the parts you like.
Please check all his tweets and posts in reddit.
Having Luke (a guy that likes 300Kb blocks) thinking about doing a 2Mb hard fork in 12 mos because he sees a split in the community is extremely bullish for big blockers.
Given he is not Core, if a big part of the community is not opposed to a 2Mb fork it will be done. But not in the S2X way which is reckless.
The safety and stability of the network goes first for them and I highly value and respect that. Bitcoin must have a great foundation for all that is coming (adoption, new uses, new attacks)
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:53:08
Totally agree, that is why we need to stop S2X.
We will be able to create a new Bitcoin if this one fails, but it will set us back years or decades.
Signatories do not realize how much this could hurt them, a centralized Bitcoin is worthless. Their short sighted takeover attempt will probably destroy their businesses (along with everyone´s savings)
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:50:15
All indicates S2X wants to fire Core, Peter from blockchain said so.
This is about controlling the reference client and made back door decisions regarding development. Those will benefit miners and signatories and screw users to milk them more money ;)
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:23:15
They have, its called BCH ;)
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:52:06
Classic had 70% of hashpower and did not activate.
BU has over 50% of hashrate signaling.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:43:59
You need to review facts again.
Even Erik admitted all those are lies pushed by Bitmain and Roger.
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:14:55
Check how BCH works and its EDA. Worthles miners coin ;)
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:47:28


I am not saying they will "honestly extend" the BTC chain, but if price stays with BTC and drops S2Xcoin (like happened with BCH) they will definitely "extend" the BTC chain ;)
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:57:39
I think S2X support will crumble as soon as one of the big one drops.
I think RSK did the right thing here.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:36:20
I think this is the reason, "Review per-txout indexing and storage"
Its not easy to modify the whole utxo modifications on Core 0.15
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:58:37
Soft forks work better. ;)
Everything helps, community consensus, hashrate, twitter, businesses, markets, devs...
No one chooses, we all do.
Not easy but its the way Bitcoin must be. If somebody calls the shots or has more power than the others everything will crumble as changes benefit one side.
OR status quo!
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:36:14

Message-ID: &lt;CABnzwL+tmDpxRhOGWKg_hHFcKcw1+uTiFLhHnFRRSM+KNZ4kuw
Dear all,
Sergio, Diego and myself have been discussing the potential implications of
the November 2xHF and its lack of replay protection upon all the recent
information from Bcash and the reaction of the ecosystem. Below you will
find a summary of our thoughts.
New info:
   - The Bcash fork was successful and not contentious
   - It was received as "free money" by Bitcoiners and the users seem to be
   cool with ViaBTC
   - All exchanges/wallets are working to make the coins available
   - No major attacks have been registered and now both chains seem to be
   working without permanent contentious attacks from the competing miners
   - Bcash plans to launch an aggressive pipeline of innovation Schors,
   Drivechain, Emergent consensus, LN and merge-mining to promote its use/price
   - The ecosystem has now more development diversification/decentralization
   - Price of BTC + BCash &gt; Original BTC
   - *REPLAY PROTECTION (RP) was key for all the points addressed before.*
   - Bcash proved that is fairly easy and quick to add RP
   - Past evidence shows that the name seems to stay with Devs/Repo
   (happened with ETH and Bcash)
Why are we worried:
   - The current version of the NYA does not include RP
   - Without RP, at the HF there will be a lot of uncertainty and
   confusion. Users &amp; exchanges will be forced to halt their
   transactions/trading until there is a clear outcome of the fork which we
   think may take up to 2 weeks.
   - Users willing to transact will be loosing their tokens in some of the
   chains
      - The NYA will probably be perceived as an attack on the users
      - Users will be disappointed for not having their tokens duplicated
      - An endless war will be started between both groups, minimizing the
      chances of independent Core developers contributing to the btc1 repo
   - Even without RP it is hard to predict how the ecosystem will call the
   2x token
   - *It is unclear how many of the original signatories of the NYA still
   support it today given the new info and the no RP*
Why btc1 should include RP:
   - Having RP on the NYA would bring the following benefits:
      - Trading will not be stopped (reducing the ETH flippening risk or
      BTC price collapse)
      - Bitcoiners will love it for duplicating their tokens
         - Market will expect Price of BTC + BTC2x &gt; Original BTC
      - Both teams will compete in terms of innovation, security, services
      to users and lower fees
      - There will not be a significant incentive for miners/holders to
      attack the competitive chain.
      - It will be easier for devs to contribute to both teams/repos
      - Eventually the most successful blockchain will be called Bitcoin in
      the long term
   - Potential liabilities (?): All exchanges (specially those publicly
   signing the NYA) should discuss with their technical and legal teams how
   they are going to make the Core tokens available once their users claim them
Given that very few details has been discussed with the NYA signatories
back in May, it is very important to clarify whether having REPLAY
PROTECTION is open to discussion or not, so all signatories can
confirm/reject their support to the NYA.
Our goal has always been to try to keep the ecosystem together protecting
the network effect, however if a separation is inevitable, at least it
should be done in a way that protects users interests at all costs.
If the btc1 group agrees to include REPLAY PROTECTION, we would be happy to
allocate resources to collaborate in the development or testing of it.

To make it appear legit ;)
S2X mailing list in September had 13 emails, core a few hundred ;)

^^ This.
You are the man, solid advice.

I didnt say it would be mainstream ;)
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:05:47
Everyone opposes S2X except a few corporations, which of course don´t care about users, just increased benefits.
S2X at this point will only benefit BCH.
Its closed source code, controlled by miners, trying to remove Core devs (while copying their code as no development occurs on btc1) and a contentious fork that is not needed as mempool is now empty.
I believe a blocksize increase fork can be planned with Core devs in the next year or two...but S2X is not the way.
Get your priorities straight, Bitcoin needs to scale safely, not giving up centralization on the way (which will definitely kill it) for short term profits by several companies.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:48:27
Users -&gt; Price -&gt; Hashrate
It works like this.
BCH is hashrate without users, and price shows.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:26:41
It is rushed because there is no time to organize a hard fork properly when all nodes upgrade. Core just showed the world soft forks can scale bitcoin without the hassle. And 200 nodes run btc1, less than 3%. It will be a mess and investors will lose funds even worse than with the BCH fork.
It is untested because even the fork test on testnet had to be manually unstuck by Jeff (by manually creating txns and modifying the btc1 code)
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:04:21
Attacks from BTC on the S2X chain will only give them reasons to fight back. We dont need to get down to their level.
These are their last minute desperate attempts to keep the project running. But S2X is on life support and signatories will drop faster when they see what´s actually on the code.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:02:14
I dont think there is a lot of people supporting S2X for those two reasons you mention.
I think this will happen if the S2X fork fails, but not before...
Honestly, I think if Segwit wouldn´t have been stalled for over a year, Core would likely have that HF ready.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:27:18
It doesn't. It reduces supply and makes them harder to get.
Wait until exchanges close, Bitcoin price should be more expensive in China than US or EU
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:47:17
Because most users will keep using the real Bitcoin and dump S2xcoin.
The only way they can prevent this is without replay protection.
Its a Corporate Attack on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:46:08
Yep, important no missing. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:43:07
I think he has a point.
Bitmain and Roger have spent a lot of money shilling and supporting BCH, I am sure at this point they will spend more to hurt Bitcoin and push up the price of BCH
@_date: 2017-10-19 09:34:39
His last article is a total disgrace.
Hard for me to think they are that naive, ulterior motive has to be to gain control over the protocol to increase their short-term profits. But if they control it Bitcoin is worthless...
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:51:18
That lie has been rebuted millions of times. And to you several times on this same thread.

How did the BCH guys survive?
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:51:01
I completely agree with you.
I am just saying they can´t blame Blockstream this time for the S2X fork. They did not sign the agreement and they didn´t endorse it from the beginning
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:23:22
Corporate seeds (tell your node who to connect to) where changed to include 4 companies seeds. One of them is Jeff Garzik blockchain analisys company, bloq. I will never run that code.
131 +        vSeeds.push_back(CDNSSeedData("seed.b-pay.net", "seed.mainnet.b-pay.net", false)); // **BitPay** seed

@_date: 2017-09-28 13:14:26
You totally lost me there. 
Segwit2X wants to fork away and "fire" core (while copying the Core code almost entirely) and Core has to modify their code (thousands of clients will not be upgraded in two months, but that's probably another story) to make it compatible with the "attacking" implementation?
The block size change is not the problem here. 
The corporate takeover attempt is.
Segwit2X has no technical reasons to be, only political ones.

Yes, Bitmain only accepted BCH on their last batch.
Which other businesses did stop accepting Bitcoin? Lost me there...
Segwit upgrade was stalled by miners those 2 years prior...dont see your point.
Bitcoin dominance would be better if segwit wasn't blocked by miners for over a year. And will improve once S2X is called off ;)

btc1 is not open source. Ask any developer. 
Github is just a fachade not fooling anyone. All decisions are made and discussed somewhere else.
Been in github, still waiting for any proof there is a test plan.
I am sure everyone agreed on the corporate seeds they added to the code.
Where can you sign up for the "segwit2x tech call" Jeff mentions below? 
Or the workgroup where Bitmain and BU propose changes?




EDIT: formatting and replaced "Been there" by "Been in github"
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:06:22
Sure, to save face and avoiding UASF from activating it ;)
Will the hashrate mine S2X coin after the fork? Do you know?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:29:51
That worked flawlessly on testnet.
Chain stopped for over 24 hours until Jeff **manually** created a block over 1mb in size.
Hoping on txns being there after the first Bitcoin hard fork is naive at best, reckless at most.
EDIT: He apparently had to create fake txns to fill that block and even change the code settings to allow S2X code producing a bigger block...scary...
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:03:39
**Get your coins out to a wallet where YOU control the keys**
You should even without an upcoming fork.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:12:26
Agree. I expect support withdrawing soon, who will be the first one?
That is, after F2pool, Wayniloans, Bitwala.... ;)

He could be the co-founder ;)
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:57:04
The existing BTC chain is and always will be the real Bitcoin.
You are of course free to fork the real Bitcoin and create an altcoin (like BCH did)
Market knows better.
One more time, Blockstream employs 5 or 6 core devs (out of 485 contributors) and their contract leaves clear those 5 devs retain IP for their work on Bitcoin.
You are free to create a new software implementation following consensus, if its good people will run it. So far all attempts had buggy undeveloped code, funded by miners.
@_date: 2017-10-05 13:53:34
I agree.
One man reckless code with technical decisions made by a small group is not OK for me. Corporate seeds? Come on!
I think Luke hit the nail, nobody opposed to a 2Mb consensus HF in 12mos aprox.
@_date: 2017-10-10 06:15:40
Yeah, they don´t like that interpretation. That would mean they can leave the S2X chain after the fork :)
The agreement does not state they have to exclusively mine the S2X chain, does it?
Each signatory has their own interpretation of what it meant.
The corporate seeds in the code were not in the agreement but they are in the code ;)
In any case, miners will **always** mine the most profitable chain.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:07:02
I liked him on the Netflix documentary, he was on the good side then.
Supporting the S2X hard fork is bananas and anti-bitcoin.
 - The closed room deal is not how Bitcoin works
 - Corporate seeds on the code.
 - Technical decisions made on a closed call.
 - Closed mailing list
 - Bad actors involved
 - Several signatories now shilling (and mining) BCH
 - No proper replay protection
 - One dev code, 99% copied from Core (the ones some signatories want to "fire")
 - ...
If the S2X succeeds Bitcoin will start dying :(
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:51:00
Exchanges can´t support hard forks without replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:24:19
LOL, this is just too funny!
@_date: 2017-10-03 08:49:06
That´s how agreements work.
If you dont sign you are a non-supporter. If you sign you are a supporter ;)
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:25:54
S2X may fail before the fork, I expect they will not release a statement until its a little more clear what will happen :(
But yes, they should clarify!
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:42:11
203 nodes running btc1 45 days before the hard fork is "nobody"
And hashrate will most likely jump to most profitable chain like its happening with BCH at times.
They can fork, but they will not take the community with them.
Some of the smartests guys work for Bitcoin today, and a few of those were ready to bet a few million against Roger. They know more than me and bitcoin will likely survive this corporate takeover attempt ;)
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:41:04
Agree, I doubt we will get there.
Miners and corporations have a lot more to lose than you an me. UASF worked for that same reason, I will lose my savings, they would lose their businesses and reputation
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:58:05
I expect more and more companies will start doing that.
By holding benefits on Bitcoin they could have earned 300-400% more this year alone.
After the S2X bullshit fork in November a lot of interested parties (Banks and corps) will get in. Just hoping they call it off to see Bitcoin reach 8k earlier ;)
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:19:52
It seems you picked the longer estimation there was. Code should be quickly fixed, consensus and upgrade all nodes will take longer.
I am sure it can be done in 12 mos with consensus, check Luke´s and other posts. I am doing all the research for you ;)
EDIT: And Segwit adoption being at 7%, still room for growth
@_date: 2017-10-16 22:30:49
Thanks...to you and all
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:58:36
Go on, make it ;)
I just wrote this here, may help you:
This has been rebutted a million times already. Please check on google.
A handful of devs may work for blockstream, but they retain their IP for bitcoind work as many have stated. They like Bitcoin and work on it on their free time and Blockstream does not in any way force Bitcoin code changes upon them.
Other devs work also for other companies, and some have enough money they dont have to work. You are talking about hundred of core developers, not just 5.
I can tell you which projects are entirely funded by one company that single handedly forces changes upon that same code: XT, BU, Parity, ExtB, Classic, btc1, ABC,...
"If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry."
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:46:04
Yes, same tactic Bitmain uses.
Threatened law suit to F2pool, bought Bitpay, ViaBTC, ....
The more I see, the more I am convinced they are evil while playing dumb.
S2X is an attack on Bitcoin and must be stopped.

Thought I saw it on twitter, looking.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:27:18


Not really, technical decisions are made by signatories on private slack. Github page is just a fachade where commits are published but not discussed.


Agree, and no one is using. 2% of nodes?


S2X does not have replay protection, check github. Users and investors will lose money due to this contentious hard fork, and not all users are tech savvy. Can you show us the replay protection proposed in the code? If you are referring to an OPCODE


Agreed, the S2X minority chain that breaks away from consensus cant be protected from 95% of nodes. Neither it makes sense for a complete network upgrade each time a minority chain wants to split.
If by consensus you mean hashrate (the one that is mining BCH and BTC at the same time, and will most likely mine BTC and S2X after the fork) you are wrong.
I believe there are big investors that will have hashrate ready for the real Bitcoin, smartests minds in the community are betting a few millions against Roger the original BTC chain will survive.
Please call it off before your reputation is affected by this decision. Lots of investors, companies and users will lose money.
**And please get me a technical reason to do a block size upgrade via a contentious hard fork by a one dev software including corporate seeds (was this in NYA?) and without replay protection.**
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:48:02
The community will never support a corporate takeover attempt.
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:21:01
One more time: Hashrate signaling is not a vote. It was a method for miners to signal readiness to network upgrades.
Miners work, do not decide.
Original Bitcoin chain will remain alive, and because of price it will be mined. Just see miners jump chains like with BCH (by the way breaking NYA, and if that doesn´t break NYA watch them mine original BTC)
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:45:42
That is not even close to proper replay protection. Adding outputs to an address? Seriously? Filling up bitcoin with trash? More funds would be lost than with BCH
BCH had replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:42:59
I know, only Roger and friends may do that, with their distorted view on reality.
Adam is trying to buy them out so they leave us alone ;)
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:43:09
Maybe I even did already! ;)
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:20:08
If they are forking away why would they want to connect to Core nodes (for one month if they deploy now)?
Only reason I can see is to disrupt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:45:18
Totally agreed.
But if there was replay protection S2X would die since nobody would use it. They don´t know how to shove something nobody wants down everybody´s throat except this way.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:39:55
After the S2X fork (if it finally happens on November) anyone holding a BTC amount will get the same amount of S2X coins.
If the legacy chain dies you will have the same number of S2X coins...but that is a pretty big IF. Only a few miners and corporations want the fork, no dev or user support.
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:30:17
You are still on time. Buy an HODL, don´t trade.
And if you spend Bitcoins replace them soon.
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:51:13
So if miners and businesses want to increase coin limit to 42million and keep 21million for them its OK? They dont choose for me, as they have different interests than users, investors and hodlers.
A hard fork needs consensus or a chain split will occur. S2X needs consensus and thousands of clients will not upgrade, thus causing an split.
Without replay protection, confusion will arise and funds would be lost. NYA signatories will be responsible for that.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:36:32
LOL, ok. I also expect someone to run a few hundred nodes out of amazon to give the image of support.
So most users don't care about S2X? or they will be tricked into using it?
Most users, miners and companies will never run btc1 code ;)
@_date: 2017-10-04 07:53:46
I did mention this already too.
Them not signing the agreement means they dont support it.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:34:33
Companies choose what is best for me everyday. Not on bitcoin ;)
They are short sighted by quick benefits and power hungry. The power balance keeps Bitcoin honest and it needs to stay that way.
Otherwise it failed.
The network does not need a hard fork now, no matter what everyone tells you. Mempool is empty and Bitcoin is working flawlessly with Segwit!
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:03:38
It is a corporate attack.
Corporate because they included the corporate seeds of OB1, bloq, blockchain.info,....
Attack since no replay protection. The plan is to take over the existing chain with their "open source" software (with closed meetings deciding what is implemented in the code by companies) that nobody is running.
@_date: 2017-10-05 15:33:47
We need to get past the S2X bullshit to start
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:47:49
Yes it is.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:10:23
Could you reply to them and ask them to post their stance here?
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:42:06
BCH took away over 50% of the hashpower at times, and Bitcoin did fine.
Miners always end up in the chain users support as price follows users.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:29:08
Correct, that is why the over 1300 UASF nodes scared miners into activating Segwit.
There are still mode UASF nodes in the network than there are btc1 nodes.
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:09:02
The difference is, Bitcoin does not want to overtake your chain. Live and let live.
The only problem is S2X anticipating nobdy will run their software and their S2X coin would be worth nothing unless they manage to confuse users and take over the original chain. Its a corporate attack.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:08:32
They only have hashrate.
Users and investors give value to a coin, not hashrate, hashrate follows price.
Nodes enforce rules and there are 212 btc1 nodes, not in any way close enough to support a few billion $ market.
Just wait and watch.
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:04:37
If split, S2X coin dies.
Despite their attempts to call it an "upgrade" its clear to everyone the community and investors will not follow and it became a corporate takeover attack on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:44:34
I dont think so, not for me or other million of users.
They also claimed BCH was the real Bitcoin...see how it drops today...
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:07:12
Its not a fix, and replay protection is not a terrible choice.
Investors funds will be lost and sent to the wrong address. Imagine the confusion if there are already issues with BCH.
A lot safer for you to modify the time-locked txns you are not using. Have an example you can show?
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:15:57

As one of the signers of the New York Agreement, Bitcoin.com is strongly
against replay protection for the November 2xHF.
If replay protection is added and it's similar to Bitcoin Cash, the New
York Agreement will die and the hard fork will never actually happen.
This is the latest tactic from the Core camp to kill the hard fork.
The problem is relayed transactions is not new and has been well known
by everyone who signed the agreement. The spirit of the agreement was to
get a super majority support for the hard fork, enough to bring
non-signers over to the hard forked chain as the legacy chain would
quickly be abandoned. The difficulty of the bitcoin network is so high
right now that if 90% hard forks, the legacy chain will in practice be
unusable. Exchanges can only list activate and usable chains.
There is a reason Luke-Jr and a few other Core supporters are preparing
for a PoW change, because they know this.
Adding replay protection that breaks all wallets is a no go. Gavin's
op-return method is good enough, and Core can easily add a soft fork to
Core that works in a similar way. The replay protection responsibility
falls on to the minority chain, not the majority.

@_date: 2017-10-02 13:14:42
People and businesses did not stop running Bitcoin, its just Segwit scaling.
Bitcoin dominance shows alts market cap increasing and not Bitcoin market cap decreasing (increasing in fact)
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:28:42
Consensus is needed for an upgrade. S2X does not have consensus, therefore its an attack.
NYA agreement did not specify corporate seeds needed to be added to "copied" core code, and that no replay protection would be implemented. Just implement Segwit and create a 2Mb blocksize hardfork.
Everyone (with any technical knowledge) has said since the beginning to do a hard fork on the network in 3 months is crazy at best, how do you expect 100k nodes to be upgrade to that corporate code (that no one is running at the moment) in 40 days? 
Not possible even if there was consensus, and S2X does not have consensus, I expect over 90% of nodes to not upgrade.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:40:24
It can probably be worse.
"Legacy" chain can lose 90% of the hashpower and become unusable for 2 weeks.
Big holders can dump bitcoin to affect price and buy S2Xcoin, trying to take over the Bitcoin name.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:41:48
You mean for a few weeks before the fork?
You dont need to connect to Core nodes for that, they have a couple hundred btc1 nodes. Will they want to rely on Core nodes after the fork also (I mean, not only by copying core code?)?
If there are few S2X nodes, the solution is not piggybacking on Core nodes, but to convince signatories to spawn a few hundreds nodes on AWS.
"Yeah, mom, I want to become independent but you have to pay for my rent and I will still come here to do my laundry, get food and I will also leave my miner here ;)"
Do they want to split or do they want to screw with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:20:56
Market price.
Miners swap chains. BTC will definitely survive as it will be the most profitable.
@_date: 2017-10-09 10:04:08
According to S2X agreement, the miners were supposed to mine S2X (and signaling its support)
Segwit activation was, according to them, thanks to S2X. So the current Bitcoin chain is then the S2X chain and they left it to mine something else. I would not be so sure they will keep mining the S2X chain after the fork if they don´t now, despite signaling.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:25:08
Today S2X became an attack on the original chain. Signatories will be shamed.
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:37:34
Of course it can be fixed, but it shows bad intent and why add them?
Was that one of the points in the NYA agreement?
If I were to take over Bitcoin, the seeds would be the first I would change. But you probably know that and want to spread FUD.
You can "upgrade" to btc1 if you want like the 200 other nodes that do, most users won´t ;)
@_date: 2017-10-05 08:14:31
Finally S2X supporters realized they need more trolls to upvote this type of posts.
They are scared and they should be. The corporate takeover of Bitcoin will never happen. They need to use their software to attack Bitcoin as they know a clean fork without support will kill them quick.
Original BTC chain will retain value and not die no matter how much hashrate they have. Hashrate moves like we have seen with BCH.
No one is going to run an undeveloped, untested code developed by one guy. In fact market will probably value S2Xcoin at $100 based just on the software alone.
Let´s see how many nodes we see once S2X is released, so far nobody runs it (200 nodes 40 days before the fork...)
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:31:01
There is only one BTC ;)
And a centralized Blockchain is just a database, no real world use except for decentralized applications (which no companies would want to use...)
@_date: 2017-10-02 10:18:30
Wrong, UASF showed miners they don't have support from the community and they were forced to upgrade to Segwit.
NYA only exists because of UASF.
Most companies, users and devs do not support S2X.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:18:04
LOL, hoping it wont...otherwise we may see $2500

The moment corporate seeds were added to btc1 code it was clear to me its a takeover attempt. One of the many Bitcoin will have.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:53:27
I don´t use S2X supporting companies.
In fact usually companies interests are opposite of mine.

You are completely wrong there. The companies I use do not represent me, or you for that matter.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:38:13
Yes, but I doubt we will get that far.
Honest miners will stick to the the real Bitcoin, specially after seeing how BCH is dropping. Bigger blocks without support from the community mean nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:11:43
Go ahead and download the client then, they will need more than 200 nodes to run Bitcoin ;)
btc1 is not for me, though.
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:42:44
Same to you!
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:07:10
One miner (Antpool) did create BCH, so to me they were somehow critical :) The crazy EDA benefits them short term as block reward will deplete earlier.
For S2X they aligned with businesses that wanted they scaling debate unlocked.
And yes, definitely its a risk. I think the power balance in Bitcoin is carefully designed and miners and corporations will step down last minute as NYA did after UASF nodes increased showing user preferences.
We will find out soon. If this Bitcoin fails we will have to create a new one :)
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:20:19
Core estimates 18-36 months for a non-split hard fork, but I am sure 12mos is doable. Doing it in three months like S2X expects is reckless and messy, we will see it in November.










 


Check roadmap:
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:56:11
Its true, please check the link on top.
Everyone can use overt AsicBoost if Jihan wants (as he holds the patent in China)
Skipping steps in a protocol reduces security.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:21:31
I agree, but mind they are using false reasons to block Segwit and the so not clear relationship is fooling many.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:02:34
Thanks! Still too many doubts on this, and I am sure Bitmain will try to pull it off...
But he probably knows it will be hard to stop their Segwit flavor once this has started.
Why not just activate Segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:09:54
Its clear to me the 2 user settings and the "miners" only setting used in BU will not work in consensus and will create multiple forks.
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:48:02
Lets upgrade one step at a time. Segwit triples txn capacity and provides multiple benefits. Its tested and works.
After Segwit, we can increase block size if needed. Similar to Litecoin Agreement.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:33:04
LOL, awesome answer :)
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:00:09
Did you pay any fee? :)
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:17:17
This will fork bitcoin so many times per day its not even funny. You are giving any miner the option to increase blocksize at any given time without consensus. It will not happen
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:31:34
Will this block Covert Asicboost then? If it gives Bitmain an ounce of more power I will sell my Bitcoins so quickly it will hurt.
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:45:17
Sorry for your loss...
I have been tempted to do this multiple times, last time I swap 2 BTC for Litecoin and lost almost half... But moral of the story remains, HODL!
It is quite difficult to know what is going to happen tomorrow, alts are even more risky than Bitcoin. Just set aside a small amount of your BTC to play with, but I would never go all in!
@_date: 2017-05-26 07:14:53
Me too!
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:38:52
Miners are just the workers. They have no say in what software users do want to run.
I understand they want more power, more fees, and being able to control blocksize (causing multiple forks in the process) with BU, but it will not happen. UASF it is.
My only doubt is if we need to block covert asicboost first, then Segwit or just UASF and Segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:08:30
From you source: "up to one quarter of the total computational work can be saved by this approach." This makes the network less secure, also creating empty blocks in the process.
I guess you don't want to block it even though no one is using it.
I would like to hear your plan to make all miners use it then :)
EDIT: I never said AsicBoost "skip any verification of blocks", I said it skip steps in the process.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:05:15
Yep, we need to take all that bullshit out of the way.
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:34:16
Its patented. Go convince Jihan he should release the patent to help his miner friends and the community...
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:16:10
Usually no budget, IT understaffed everywhere. They will get the blame and the execs that block the budgets wont...
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:21:22
I suspect the plan is to do Segwit AND 2MB upgrade in the same HardFork, thus blocking Asicboost.

@_date: 2017-05-30 18:42:15
I think many people think this way, no one strictly opposes a block size increase HF (even Adam Back proposed roadmap) but the time will come after Segwit. Lets scale in a smart and efficient way.
All bitcoiners have more in common than we think, the enemy is centralization (always be vigilant, on everyone) and we should focus on fixing the most urgent issues first.

@_date: 2017-05-12 12:54:48


Good for you. You like big blocks. On topic please:


If its not scary you will most likely not oppose blocking it?


You can´t use asicboost, its patented.
Asicboost will prevent any new mining manufacturers to enter into the market (good for Bitmain) No one can compete with that patented advantage. Go start a mining business when your competitor already has a 20% advantage, good luck to you :)
Also reduces Bitcoin security by skipping steps in the block validation. Its an exploit of the protocol only benefiting a few.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:24:05
In this case, yes ;)

@_date: 2017-05-30 18:57:37
Who disagrees on Segwit? 
Some were just blocking it to get their HF and block increase. Not because it is bad or they dont want it, but because they used the stalling for their benefit.
I dont think Segwit is avoidable at this point, it will happen. If done correctly via SF and current implementation, fine. If not UASF...
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:26:59
I think the plan is to do HF for Segwit, but its not clear.
Everyone that signed thinks differently of the agreement :(
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:05:28
Totally agree, they are trying anything now to scare the users and using delay tactics. UASF does definitely scare them, let get the power back to the users!
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:29:46
Will this block Covert Asicboost then? If it gives Bitmain an ounce of more power I will sell my Bitcoins so quickly it will hurt.
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:09:27
Yep, they want Segwit their way (with covert AsicBoost, remote kill switch,...)
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:15:25
I am not opposed to increasing the block size to 2Mb BUT Segwit must be deployed first, via MASF or UASF if else.
That said...I did set up my UASF node yesterday and I am willing to lose my savings fighting for what is right. 
We can then start again with new miners. They are the ones that will lose more than us and will also get beat up by the mafia in some cases :)
@_date: 2017-05-19 09:04:16
EDIT: Adaptative block size (meaning user or miner configurable) will fork bitcoin so many times per day its not even funny.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:19:57
Yes, definitely worth it. If (and I bet my hand they are using it now) they dont use it now, they expect to use it in the future. Implementing it in the chips is very expensive. You dont design, patent and implement something like that just for fun ;)
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:30:01
Lets block it then...Bitmain won´t complain
@_date: 2017-05-22 15:41:47
You are right, but with LN and triple the transactions per block my guess is fees should lower significantly.
@_date: 2017-05-21 08:40:15
If scalability is fixed yes. If not probably 6k to 8k and then it may correct down to 4k
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:09:51
So what is the threat to miners? Covert Asicboost blocking?
Any other thing they don´t like about Segwit?
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:55:48
Thanks for the laugh. Next up 10K!
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:34:45

@_date: 2017-05-12 12:12:23


I like to think of this as "BU nodes will fork themselves off the main network" 
They can hopefully create BTU and stop bothering the Bitcoin community
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:31:13
Agreed totally. Lets do UASF or MASF for Segwit.
Then we can work on a safe 2Mb HF.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:35:19
But he is not using it, what can he say to not support it?
"Patent holders will not get rewarded?" That would definitely seem like a direct attack on centralization and evening out the playing field.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:08:21
It would be more effective, agreed. But no consensus will be obtained on Segwit, to block covert Asicboost should be possible and I don´t see anyone opposing to it (Well, I can think of one guy but he will probably need to explain why) :)

Independence day is August 1st 2017 ;)
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:49:30
They do make good products, no one disagrees.
Their problem is power, they want to stop Segwit at any cost. In the meantime their stalling has caused fees to increase (and thus their profit)
Segwit does stop covert Asicboost (which they claim they are not using) and will open the way to off-chain transactions away from their control (Lighting / LN)
They also include remote kill switches in products and gather information secretly from their machines, which seems like a evil plan to me.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:44:49
I believe the plan is to modify Segwit first, which makes no sense to me...unless you want to not block covert Asicboost, insert remote kill switch,....
@_date: 2017-07-06 05:50:18
I love healthy debate! Its just the same propaganda over and over ;)
I did support Segwit8x at first, until I found out:
- It was a done deal, companies just had to sign it. Who got the idea and the original request? It seems there was no debate.
- Companies and Miners dont run Bitcoin. This sets a bad precedent where they will expect to run changes in the future and dismiss users, exchanges,...
- Segwit already does a block size increase, and brings multiple improvements needed that will save even more space (Schnorr sigs) and Lightning (Millions of txns off-chain)
- A rushed hard fork is dangerous and unneeded. Lets observe Segwit for a few months and if then needed lets plan a safe hard fork. No one is fundamentally opposed to a block size increase, but I am for a rusjed unneeded one.
- Up to 8mb blocks are quite a big jump from the current 1mb
- This is also just a move to remove Core, which have contributed the most to the success of Bitcoin and start a closed source software run by few. Many core devs will leave Bitcoin if this succeeds and I dont blame them.
But I guess we will have to see how it goes in the next weeks ;)

Do you think Asicboost is good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:36:21
The timeframe suggests they are quite scared about UASF.
Good news is Segwit will be activated one way or another :)
I don´t mind 2MB HF as long as covert Asicboost is blocked by a SW SF.

Will this block Covert Asicboost then? If it gives Bitmain an ounce of more power I will sell my Bitcoins so quickly it will hurt.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:22:21
Its covert. Patented, implemented, admittedly used on testnet, emty blocks,...I have all the proof I need.
You got me naked in this room with a hooker, and with condoms and lube but I definitely had no intent on having sex!!! ;)
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:11:33
The reason is Asicboost. Maybe they can also throw in the mix a remote kill switch or collecting users info for China :)
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:00:35
An attack or someone from Bitmain trying to help them get to the hard fork part sooner....ups!
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:16:32
Blocking Asicboost first will make Segwit activated in no time. And we will see everyones true faces. Segwit and Asicboost should be separated.
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:28:48
I doubt they are trying to delay anything, but to stop the UASF movement. Look at the tight schedule...
My only concern is:
  - Without Core developing the software will suck
  - Why not implement SW SF now if they have the hashpower?
  - Will this be a Segwit HF?
  - Will this keep covert Asicboost?
So many unanswered questions on this agreement...
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:40:17
Yes, do you?
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:08:18
You need to ask Jihan for confirmation then.
Either he is a madman spending millions on a technology he is not using on main net (but no doubt he plans to use in the future) or he is using it in his mining pools.
But it really does not matter, we can block it as nobody is using it.
I can´t help you further, you can discard all the circumstantial evidence. For most people all that proof and the implications are enough.
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:04:11
So they blocked scaling because they did not code what Jihan wanted when he wanted it?
Get your facts right, the only working and tested scaling solution is Segwit which has been stalled by Jihan since the beginning to earn more fees and protect Asicboost
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:22:43
We can probably work on one at a time ;)
What are the other reasons against Segwit?
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:07:01
Segwit "signalling" blocks, I believe

@_date: 2017-07-18 14:13:38
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:29:59
I think the schedule is tight enough to leave it running in testnet without any tests, mining, checks or anyone watching.
They should be running tests like crazy with all type of clients and watching it perform against them.
This higher than expected block generation should have been caught within the 1st hour in my opinion...
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:34:24
Agree, I don´t expect a hard fork will be needed earlier than a year after Segwit activation.

You still need a little more of research to understand Bitcoin.
Miners follow users, which are the ones that provide value to Bitcoin.
If miners (or any other group) have the control Bitcoin is worthless as decentralized currency.
EDIT: Follow what happens with the BitcoinABC chain if it forks. You will have miners controlling that coin and I expect the value (that users provide) will be much lower

I expected tests to be ran, but ok, opened  and posted a couple ideas.
If there is a test plan, great. If not one should be created.
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:13:19
I have not seen a test plan.
At least this should be done before and after the HF:
 - Is the new client interacting with all other software implementations in testnet5? (XT, BU, Core, Classic,...in all their versions?)
 - Is someone mining all types (empty, over 2-4mb,...) of blocks with and without Segwit transactions? I just see blocks with a 50B reward (0.3Kb)
Its not FUD, its what I think someone in the project should be doing. A plain old test plan, checklist with tests,...highlight and fix issues....
If it exists, great. This chain stalling issue has shown me it does not seem to exist. Just running nodes with no transactions and no one checking anything (I expect 24 hours of chain stalling should be noticed a little earlier)
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:09:38
Hope you are right...but no one can be sure this is how it will happen.
I would rather have a definitive way of doing it.

This shows support over 13% for UASF. 
UASF will succeed as miners realize CW, Roger and Jihan can´t be trusted and start signaling BIP141 in a couple weeks.
If you don´t want to support it that's fine, the rest of us will.
I could care less about Classic, XT, BU, ExtB, NG, Parity or whatever other failed client reported. They would not even exist if it wasn´t for a few malicious actors trying to take over bitcoin. They don´t even realize that centralization would kill Bitcoin right after they showed their control, it is a very shortsighted plan.
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:47:36
Segwit will fix that, abling to escalate in multiple ways (including a block size increase) Lightning will allow millions of new users, Schnorr signatures can save about 25% of block size...
Just increasing the block fixes nothing
@_date: 2017-07-11 10:20:30
If by "that client works" you mean a "hanged" hard fork not producing blocks for 24 hours, I agree :)
Just hoping there will be transactions in the mempool after the first Bitcoin hard fork is not a solution.
And, manually creating a &gt;1Mb block is just a workaround.
But the issue is closed now, so everything should be fine.
@_date: 2017-07-07 07:42:43
It has nothing to do with racism and Chinese costumes. 
Jihan is a villain trying to take over control of Bitcoin, no matter where he is from.
He controls manufacturing and hash rate and now he wants to control the software too. He just does not understand Bitcoin, as centralization and control will make it useless.

@_date: 2017-07-11 08:40:14
I sure don´t know more than nullc and don´t know why he would lie.
Forks in segnet with a developing protocol can happen, but someone must be looking and checking. Please see in that same email thread how they want to find out what happened and why to correct it.
In testnet5 a fork block was created manually to "unstuck" the chain, and it raises multiple questions that should have been asked already;
- Was this planned and expected?
- Is there a fix besides "we expect more transactions on mainnet"?
- Is there possibly a better way to signal / commence the fork?
- Issue closed after a workaround applied (create big block manually)? Come on...we need higher standards than that
I expect full testing with multiple clients, issues found and fixed and not just workarounds applied. The fork is ok in testnet5, the chain to be stuck and not progressing not.
You are planning to run this in Bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-07-11 10:28:46
Was it created with the btc1 client?
Manually meaning not automatically created, miners intervention required.
By modifying the bitcoin.conf manually? Did the client need a restart of the process?
It would be a good idea to have a set of steps needed by miners to proceed with the hardfork, including the exact time they should perform them...
I might be wrong, but I feel issue should not be closed and testnet5 should be monitored closely while multiple tests are performed (including blocks with transactions if possible)
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:33:53
Most pools signaling Segwit now ;)
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:37:17
The Trojan horse will work in the opposite way.
Segwit will get implemented before August 1st, and no one will run the Segwit8x code except Jihan friends.

@_date: 2017-07-12 15:39:03


You can´t expect there will be that many transactions on mainnet after Bitcoin´s first hard fork. Blocks are not even full now. You can´t perform a hard fork on Bitcoin just "hoping" it will be fine.
This shows no one was looking at testnet for over 24 hours.


On Github you indicate bitcoin.conf had to be modified from default values for Segwit2x nodes to mine blocks over 1Mb. 
"That is just a policy setting, which will likely remain untouched for segwit2x release - thus defaulting to smaller blocks absent miner updating their configuration file.
To mine a larger block, miners should opt into that with a setting in  bitcoin.conf :
This leads to indicate this setting had to be modified on bitcoin.conf file and service restarted. 
It seems issue was closed with a manual workaround.
Things like this happen on testnet and its OK, but we need to learn from them. I do firmly believe extensive testing has to be performed before the Hard Fork.
EDIT: Did you take into account this block starts the hard fork and mempool is shared until its mined? Mempool will be emptied by nodes on original chain.
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:16:09
IF there is a fork...you will get coins that existed before the fork on both chains.

@_date: 2017-07-12 15:47:28
  They have to mine a &gt;1Mb block to FORK. This means pool is still shared.
  In fact in testnet5 a BU node kept the original chain running. How do you expect their nodes to gather a 1mb of txns if other nodes in the original chain keep emptying the mempool?
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:36:50
I lost you there...
BU and Segwit2x will coexist for a few months at least. They need to be compatible and follow consensus. It needs to be tested their functionalities do not clash.
There are BU nodes on testnet5 already...
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:22:31
If you are 100% certain they will be enough txns on the shared mempool at fork block time, great.
If you are not 100% sure (I am not) this should be extensively tested, and a plan developed to make sure it goes smoothly.
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:06:55

-What if (since this will be the first hard fork in Bitcoin) no one transacts after it? Will they get stuck irremediably?
-Who is going to mine that block? Their client will?
So glad someone "attacked" them so this can be checked. Baffled it was not until this point.

Going back up, everyone realized they were shopping for things they did not need :)
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:04:53
Yeah, in summer 2018 :)
No one is opposed to a hard fork increase, but now its not the time. After Segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:57:23
The point is why they were not?
This resulted in no one monitoring testnet, and days going by with no reason...
Not a real testnet if no one is transacting or looking, at least they could have sped things if they had a testing plan and added a miner there...

Just keep helping his agenda. 
He wants unlimited 50BTC block rewards for himself and he is quite control hungry.
Controls great hashpower and 70% of manufacturing. Already planned his own hardfork (BitcoinABC) and is now trying to remove core from the picture. He does not want to help you or Bitcoin, just control it and milk it till its dry.
Big blocks will just give him more money, control and power. His short sighted views will kill Bitcoin much sooner than later. Please choose what and who you support carefully.
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:04:43
I can tell you how it will go:
Jihan will try to get rid of the 21 million cap and will at the same time serve Bitcoin control to the chinese government. Please see his latest "Future of Bitcoin" chat, he shares the same centralized, control, dictatorship, censorship is good view the Chinese goverement has. He does not understand Bitcoin at all.
By controlling it he will kill it and he will not stop until controlling development, already has mining equipment manufacturing which got him most of the hashrate by coercing other miners (Like telling GBminers he will not sell them if they dont signal BU)
He his creating alternate pools and exchanges, if we lose this fight we lose the war and Bitcoin is done. It will set the crypto ecosystem 8 years back.
Bitcoin will be worse than a bank and be worth zero in 2 years if he suceeds.
I cant believe that you and YeOldDoc are the only guys creating negativity in most posts in this sub. Please go praise Bitmain somewhere else.

@_date: 2017-07-12 08:35:43
I understand your point, testnet is for tests. I get that some disruption is expected. 
Do you really want me to open a github issue to propose a testing plan to be created? I can definitely do that, the project needs it to succeed.
Blockchains get attacked everyday. Everyday Bitcoin survives is a huge step.
If you don´t have a test plan that accounts for attacks and all other possible options that may happen a lot of people will lose money.

Segwit IS a block size increase.
And allows effective scaling.
Increasing the block size is a short sighted fix

You have been writing here so much against UASF and Core its not even funny.
We won and you lost, the good always prevails in Bitcoin. Yet we can forgive and should remain united.
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:28:11
All users (and exchanges which service users) should run a full node to verify txns and discard out of consensus blocks.
But I agree, not all users run full nodes. But they should :)

This is just so funny :)

Yeah! If we get a couple more to join we should lock in by late Thursday or early Friday :)
I think we still need F2pool and ViaBTC to get to 80%...they are big with about 5% each.
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:36:13


Signers of the Segwit2x agreement were not allowed to give their opinion. For all I know (and devs report) they were told please support this, we dont take suggestions. It is this.
It does try to remove Core. Bitmain does not like their view and just wants bigger blocks.


Nope, but devs freely contribute to the code and propose and code multiple improvements. If miners disregard all those and just want to double the blocks the coding will not get very interesting.
4 fucking discussion years does not make it less of a rushed hard fork.
A Hard fork was not needed 4 years ago, and still not needed now. We need Segwit to escale in an efficient way, just doubling the block size fixes nothing and delays the issue resolution.
I believe those agreements are just because stalling by one miner supporting everything but Segwit. They are forcing other miners to signal for BU or he will not sell them equipment.
Everyone (but one) wants Segwit and we will get that soon enough.
@_date: 2017-07-12 09:11:46
It would be wise to have the test plan made public and peer reviewed to add improvements and make sure nothing is missing.
The hard fork issue was detected because a BU node kept increasing the blockchain, so I think other clients should be able to join the testnet without issues.
"I also have a BitcoinUnlimited node up on testnet5 which has no such reject builtin and this one is now on block 32767..."
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:01:12
F2pool is a known troll, he is probably still buying and will signal once his bags are full :)
ViaBTC should start signaling soon now that Bitmain is also.
BW pool I don´t know if they will start soon.
We definitely need them to start before this afternoon to make sure BIP91 locks in the next period!
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:30:06
Lets wait three weeks. 
Segwit8x will not happen, it will kill Bitcoin.
Please go back to the other sub.
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:58:10
I am not so sure.
Miners have to run btc1 code which is rushed and untested and stay on course over the next three months.
80% of Core nodes have to upgrade to support the fork. If Core does not release a fork supporting version we will get a new split with a segwit coin and a segwit2x coin.
So no one can tell what will happen...
@_date: 2017-07-04 09:01:23
You dont have a say on the dollar monetary policy.
I do have a voice for Bitcoin. I support UASF
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:19:44
I did not mention BIP148...
I said I would rather have a hard fork method that does not depend on the mempool size and people wanting to get their txns in the fork block.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:41:57
Correct :)
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:37:37
So the issue was fixed by manually modifying the bitcoin.conf file, restarting the client and creating multiple transactions for the &gt;1mb block to be created. If you think that is ok thats great.
I would like to see an extensive testing plan, at least with all other software implementations, multiple txn types, empty and huge blocks,...to see if issues arise and to fix them before go live. You know, an actual testing plan.
Leaving software by itself mining empty blocks while no one is looking can not be called a testing plan.
But if you think everything is working ok and all is good, there is probably nothing to worry
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:48:48
Not great idea to rush a hard fork to increase capacity just 3 months after capacity has been increased. Doubt it will happen as only Bitmain wants it :) 
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:06:35
Using this, shows BIP91 blocks also.
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:11:39
So lets "hope" there are few of them?
We should rely on facts (specially for a hard fork) instead of hope, just my humble opinion...
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:10:56
Did GB Miners even sign the NYA? :)
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:41:07
Segwit needs to come first.
If not it can still be done but it will be much more complicated.
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:59:18
Only Bitmain wants their hard fork, and they may have it but I doubt many companies follow them. They are already writing their ABC code.
After Segwit is in we dont need their corporate software or their hardfork
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:40:20
JUST increasing the block size is a short sighted fix. :)
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:12:53
Cool, source?
Will txns get back to the mempool once block is rejected or they will never leave it?
@_date: 2017-07-06 05:57:16
Segwit2x did not sound that bad at the beginning, but I then changed my mind:
- Done deal, this is what it has been decided, sign it or you are out. You have no say and we dont accept suggestions
- Removes Core, some good developers will leave if this goes through and I dont blame them
- Companies will be expecting to run changes from now on. Sets a very bad precedent. Users requests will be disregarded in the future.
- A rushed hard fork to increase the block size is not needed 3 months after another block size increase. No one is fundamentally opposed to a hard fork in the future, but lets plan this carefully.
@_date: 2017-07-13 06:10:42
If you tweak the config before the fork, big blocks would be created and rejected.
You need to tweak the config just at fork time and restart the service AFAIK.
@_date: 2017-07-05 21:53:58
There is no people in Segwit2x, just companies coerced by what one miner wants because they are tired of the protocol upgrade being stalled by that same miner.
Segwit2x cant work or we will definitely lose Bitcoin as we all know it today. It will be run by companies and closed source code.
UASF is the last option we have, I believe a couple more years of their tricks will finally get them control of Bitcoin.
UASF is risky, yes. Miners have the most to lose and they will see Segwit activates soon enough to avoid UASF. No one wants a chain split.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:11:11
They will not object to blocking it then :)
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:06:15
Why would you say it requires a UASF? MASF possible, no?
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:17:08
The fork block has to be &gt;1mb, as far as I can tell.


1.Rules change on the chain at block X
2.**Sometime later somebody produces a block larger than 1M, and fork occurs**. Perhaps block X+0, perhaps X+1, perhaps X+100 or X+10000.
@_date: 2017-07-03 10:29:29
Writing the same lies multiple times don´t make them true:
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:34:57
Its the only reason they are blocking Segwit at this point.
EDIT: And why they support ANYTHING else (XT, Classic, BU, ExtB, Parity, nChain, whatevercomesnext...) 
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:07:27
Thanks! Makes sense
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:42:14
We have seen enough of Bitmain to know this is probably not a joke. I am sure along is hardfork to save face they want to modify segwit to remove the parts they do not like (Like LN / 2nd layer, Asicboost, ...)
This is quite serious but I hope no one takes this seriously. I guess we will find out the details once they publish their plan in a few hours.
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:36:56
•Is the new client interacting with all other software implementations in testnet5? (XT, BU, Core, Classic,...in all their versions?)
•Is someone mining all types (empty, over 2-4mb,...) of blocks with and without Segwit transactions? I just see blocks with a 50B reward (0.3Kb)
@_date: 2017-05-30 11:31:43
I guess they want to get sure the signaling is different as it means Segwit + 2MB HF. They want everybody to agree on both things at the same.
Since none of us trust each other any more...They don´t want to be "tricked" into activating Segwit now and no HF later...
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:05:51
Totally agree on you here
@_date: 2017-07-05 22:31:38
Yes, most companies did not even know what they signed. They were fed an "agreement" already defined to sign.
Status quo only benefits Bitmain gain more power and money.
I did not say users dont have anything to lose. But I will give up my savings for my economic independence (and everybody elses) Bitcoin must succeed.
UASF will only cause a chain split if mimers do not signal Segwit before August 1st. I did not say its not risky, I said they have more to lose and will end up signalling Segwit (aprox. 55% ATM) We'll see soon enough.
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:22:26
Our definition of high quality tested code may be different.
- No test plan that I can see.
- Manual intervention required to continue chain.
- No one checking on testnet5
- Issue closed when workaround applied.
- Based in "hoping" there will be enough txns at fork time
IMO this showed a few issues regarding the code testing. And having a fork "stuck" for 24 hours on testnet should not be called succesful ;)
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:17:42
Yeah, now add those two...
I dont think the Bitcoin community can say much about a country's energy policy, and thats OK. We can and should however try to fix exploits to the POW.
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:33:29
Yeah, and they did patent AsicBoost also. And they mine empty blocks.
Since its not used and its a non issue (as Roger says) we need to block it. Once this is done Segwit will just magically get activated...
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:42:28
I am not even sure the CN government is not behind this, trying to get control over Bitcoin. Its the biggest threat against their coin right now.
They are sure forcing them to close their mining operations and possibly threatening them and their families to go along with their plan...
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:13:41
The Segwit2x uses BIP141 to activate Segwit and in aprox. three months hard forks to double base block size.
BIP141 should enable Segwit in 4 weeks.
Segwit2x software should create a hard fork 144*90 blocks after Segwit is active (sometime around November)
Thing is, not everyone is running Segwit2x (btc1) software. The rest of the implementations will not follow that fork so we may end up with a Segwit coin and a Segwit2x coin sometime in November 
@_date: 2017-07-14 07:04:17
Why would he want FIAT? :)
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:09:31
Agreed, not easy. If Segwit is not implemented soon we will have to block it.
In any case, just implementing the BIP for blocking Asicboost can probably show Jihan he will have to drop Asicboost sooner or later and accept Segwit, no?

@_date: 2017-07-12 16:08:29
I hope you are right and a fork occurs smoothly, but we really can´t rely on "hope" for Bitcoin...
I think there will be less transactions prior to bitcoin´s first hardfork than there are now on the mempool. And surely mining nodes that don´t follow the forked chain (even if we "hope" there are few of them) will take txns onto legacy blocks not helping either.
Can we have a plan (create dummy txns if needed, make sure miners are aware of config changes needed,...) and test it?
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:24:15
Heard of a guy placing Bitcoins as a collateral for a loan....now, that sounds like a good idea!
@_date: 2017-06-05 10:22:26
I totally agree with this. Jihan and friends have at least 50% being helped by Asicboost.
@_date: 2017-07-05 10:52:16
Yes we do.
Look at that rushed Segwit2x timeframe :)
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:20:26
Segwit will fix it, BU will just break Bitcoin and fork it multiple times.

Of course, dont let anyone confuse you.
Plus Asicboost cheats the system skipping steps, it is a vulnerability and could be exploited.
It needs to be blocked either if someone is or not using it.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:45:02
UASF is now over 1000 nodes out of the total 7k, about 13%.
If you take into account Luke´s estimation of 100,000 nodes, you can also estimate around 13% of UASF nodes, or about 13000. No way of measuring the "hidden" nodes so far, just estimates.
It is not as easy as to get the data you want from different pages and add the values you want together.
According to your sources and based on Luke estimation I can as easily say 13% of nodes support UASF, or aprox. 13,000 UASF signaling nodes --&gt; about 7k nodes enforcing UASF.
