I jumped in in 2017 at $18k.
I’m here to tell you, timing is a thing.

Like I’m 5 please.... the amount of shorts means what?
Just asking for the Luddites at the back of the class....

Not that I’m a fan of how Facebook does business, but the ‘Kill It Before It Grows’ strategy is disturbing.
@_date: 2019-07-01 02:58:42
Me too.

Thanks man ��

That’s what I’m hoping. My thinking is as 21m gets closer and closer, I won’t be so sad any more. I won’t be Lambo-wealthy, but not sad either.

While trying to learn, I read Blockchain Revolution. As a high school drop-out with almost zero geekery genes, this was a mistake. I was that kindergarten kid trying to bone up on chaos theory.

Yeah, I’m with you man. I feel like that old bastard with the coffee cup.

You have any data to support your theory?

I’m embarrassed to say I have almost zero knowledge of the situation in Venezuela. I know the situation is dire, I see the articles and memes flying through my feed every day, but I’m blown away that this has even happened. I’m glad to hear the locals are finding / creating a way to rise from the ashes.

Apparently the phrase “Key 2020 U.S. Presidential Candidates” has a MUCH different definition where the authoring journalist lives.

Just b ginning to learn to read charts...  does the Triple Peak historically indicate the top of the current ride, or a momentary resting point?
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:27:26
Thanks man! So $11.2 is make or break. This, I take it, is when traditional investors take their profit. I’ve already learned how to live without the cash I’ve put down, think maybe I’ll let it ride. Thanks again bud!

I’m sorry, I can’t find the story I just read here on Reddit the other day. A guy had posted he had purchased 50something bitcoins and had them sent to his cold storage, only to discover the cold storage had immediately sent the coins out. And this was just a story from the other day. Seems like I see these stories come across my feed with a fair amount of regularity. I will send the link if I find it.

Lucky bastard. I got in at $18k. I’m STILL holding that goddam coffee cup.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:42:38
That’s the fuckn coolest grandma in recorded history!

Man but the horror stories about Nanos and Trezors arriving with pre-loaded mischief already onboard BEFORE being unboxed.... is there a way to verify cleanliness prior to use?

Hindsight fucking hurts. 
What is foresight focused on?
@_date: 2019-01-17 04:31:33
Yeah fuck you, Fry. 
Where’s your dog?

Given the increasingly shit careers that come from college educations, this may not be as ridiculous a move as it seems at first glance. Hope it works out for them!

Not enough. I was one of the sages who laughed and called it a scam when it first appeared. I laughed when I heard about a pizza that had been donated for fake money. 
I cried with regret when Bitcoin hit $20k.
