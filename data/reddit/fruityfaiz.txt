Just a question. How are you updating the prices? Are you using a service or asynctask to retrieve data? Thanks

What exactly is this segwit fork.

7 million BTC, you sure mate?

I live in the UK and they don't accept national bank transfers so I have to use sepa which the bank take money from. Also 4% fees when buying with a credit card.
With localbitcoins it's much faster, all you need is proof of identity and a bank account with the same name as you have used for localbitcoins. 
Selling on localbitcoins is also much cheaper because you don't have to worry about exchange fees.
On coinbase for me to get pounds I have to convert to euros and then to pounds. A lot of fees involved.
So if you build your rep on localbitcoins u will find it easier to sell and sell for a profit. Good luck!

I will be sure to do that, thank you. Novice here been lurking for a few months.
May I ask what segwit2x does and why developers are against it and miners for it? What does it do. 
Thank you!

Nice! Add a search bar so we can search for our coin instead of selecting.

Stay away from coinbase, buy from local bitcoins.

Oh okay thank you. Will we be expecting something similar to what happened recently in November as well?

Neo and monero dumped and converted into BTC.

If you don't mind may I ask what are the alternatives. Kraken won't verify my identity and it's been months. I've contacted them a few times as well. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:16:26
Thank you for explaining that! 
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:24:15
Exactly. I guess you could run water cooling copper pipes from the garage or storage room into the house and dissipate some of the heat there.

Thank you for your sacrifice. We appreciate it. It's for the greater good.
