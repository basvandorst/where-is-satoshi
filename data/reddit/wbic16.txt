Bitcoin clearly has the invention. All of the altcoins share the lack of invention that Dogecoin does. The software is open-source, which means anyone is free to try out a new variant.
The ease of forking new types of Bitcoin will likely help reinforce it. Dogecoin, NXT and Litecoin may not survive but they'll help point out improvements that can be incorporated into Bitcoin.
The fact is that Bitcoin has zero value without collective buy-in. That's just as true with most other altcoins.
The point, which I apparently failed to convey, was that Bitcoin pricing was just as silly in 2010 as Dogecoin is today. There weren't any vendors and no one outside of a very few were taking it seriously.

I've verified their brain wallet page against a stand-alone app. The version I accessed correctly used a sha-256 hash of my input to generate a private key. I verified the hash calculation using a third tool and then I verified the private key with the stand-alone app.
Note that you can easily provide your own entropy source(s) with a brain wallet and then independently verify it before funding the address. About 62 dice rolls provide enough entropy for the 160-bit addresses currently in use. The weakest link in the security is 128-bit, so 50 rolls may even be enough. More rolls don't hurt - they just don't help much either.
If you're worried about a key logger make sure you generate the address using a separate offline computer with a known-good copy of the site.
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:23:20
It has been well-established that you need 62 dice rolls to provide sufficient entropy for the public key (just a bit more than 160 bits). For reference: 2^160 ~ 1.462x10^(48).
While your private key has 256 bits, there are multiple private keys per public address due to hash collisions. This is why you only need 160 bits of entropy. It isn't a problem, though, because no one can predict when collisions will happen (so far).
Now, on to solving your problem. The probability term you're looking for is "permutations without replacement". This leads us to the following equation (note 0! = 1):
    n! / (n - k)!
If you're rusty on stats, this means: "n factorial divided by the quantity n minus k factorial." It is equivalent to n factorial for n=k because zero factorial is one.
Plugging into your problem and solving empirically, we find:
52! / (52 - 31)! ~ 1.578x10^48
This provides more than 160 bits of entropy, so you need **31 cards** from a randomly shuffled deck.
We can check our work a bit by estimating what would happen if we rolled a 21-sided die 31 times. This will be worse than our result because our first "rolls" have more entropy. Thus, our under-estimate is 21^31 ~ 9.745x10^(40).
This is still better than the 128-bit symmetric-key-equivalent security afforded by the private key. The private key is 256-bit, but ECDSA keys are "half as strong" as a symmetric key in terms of security.
**TL;DR: 31 cards**

It is far more effective and beneficial to invest in startups and infrastructure at this point.

There's no direct correlation between payments and bitcoin price because you don't need to hold bitcoin for even an entire day. You could acquire a balance to make a payment and return the bitcoins to an exchange within about 3 hours if the receiver cashes out immediately.
Currently the bitcoin network is logging about $225 million USD per day in transaction volume. Adding $15 million per day would put some pressure on the price, but speculation is a stronger factor.
Math: 4 billion per year / 260 days = about $15 million per day.

There will be at most 21 million btc, actually less due to loss.
If each bitcoin were worth $2.8 million USD, then the market cap would be $58.8 trillion USD.
If the price ever does spike that high it will quickly crash and then recover to a sustainable value.
I'm guessing the argument goes something like this:
If $210 billion worth of "offshore" investments accounted for 10% of Bitcoin's value, that would mean a $100,000 price and a $2.1 trillion market cap.
If you extrapolate that out to 1% of Bitcoin's value, you get up to $1 million per btc, which is within range of the $2.8 million figure. He's likely adjusting for the fact that fewer than 21 million btc have been mined or will be available.

The costs for operating a significant number of mining devices are similar to the costs for operating a transaction processing node once the network has matured.
Competition will drive hobbyists, who wouldn't measurably contribute to transaction processing anyway, to exit the market.
The cost of synchronizing pending transactions as the network grows will go up, to the point where it won't be cost-effective to broadcast them to millions of nodes. Doing so would create a bandwidth catastrophe.
Hopefully the client is using multicast...but in any event we don't actually need millions of nodes to be notified every time Alice buys a $5 latte.

It all depends upon how much value people want to hold over time and how many users there are. Here's an analysis I wrote a few months ago that illustrates some price points.
Note that there are many factors I didn't consider, like the impact of making mining more profitable prior to 2020. After 2020 mining income will be primarily determined by transaction fees.
Another thing to consider is transaction velocity. With USD you can't spend it faster than about 2-3 days each way (PayPal, CC, etc.). With Bitcoin you can do transactions in a matter of hours. That could reduce the amount of money that people need to hold.

Mining SHA-256^(2) coins is extremely competitive and is most likely a losing investment no matter what hardware you acquire.
Here's a site I check fairly often that gives a break-down of profitability for different coins.
What you'll notice is that mining litecoin or dogecoin is more profitable for a given dollar investment. That's what many people with GPU rigs are doing.
Also bear in mind that investing in hardware can be a losing investment if the price increases too rapidly. Last year I purchased and re-sold two BFL Jalapenos at a 25% profit. I could have turned an 800% profit by just investing in Bitcoin.
Given your price point you may want to look into a GPU-based scrypt mining rig with a BTC investment to go with it.

How do you measure the utility of a crypto currency? I would imagine most people would measure it in terms of barter value ("USD/BTC").
Thus, leaving a potential market untapped would *reduce* its utility.
Short-term, we need altcoins for innovation. Long-term, I'm betting that services built on top of Bitcoin will prove superior to altcoins. Why would a business risk volatility in a smaller market?
Today the difference in size is less important. Bitcoin is worth ~$10 billion; Litecoin is worth ~$0.6 billion. That's a 16:1 ratio.
If Bitcoin reaches the $1 trillion mark, the ratio for an altcoin with Litecoin's current status would be 1600:1. 
I can see people getting used to two currencies (see cola wars, browser wars, etc.). But beyond that regular folks just don't care that much. They will want something simple and stable.
Thus, I think it's more likely that fiat currency and one crypto currency (maybe Bitcoin, maybe something else) will survive. That gives people two choices and would largely serve any needs they might have.

Bitcoin has plenty of time for transaction volume to grow. 
Ten years from now (2024), the block reward will still be 6.25 BTC. Even if transaction volume hasn't increased significantly, the block reward should still be sufficient to subsidize mining activity.
It really depends upon the exchange rate. If Bitcoin is worth $3,000 in 2024, then mining revenue versus today would be 2X higher - despite a 75% drop in btc mined per block.

Vendor adoption is a leading indicator of future success. A year ago you couldn't buy real goods and services with Bitcoin. Today you can spend it at Newegg and Dell - major online retailers. It's the "if you build it, they will come" argument.
Short-term price volatility is expected and normal because, as you've said, there's no large-scale user adoption yet.
If Bitcoin succeeds, it will be valued much higher by necessity. If you used Bitcoin to pay monthly payroll checks for 10 million workers earning an average of $32,000 per year (after deductions), bitcoins would have to be worth at least $25,000 each.*
* 5% of BTC supply used to do payroll
* 32000/12 = $2667 per worker held in BTC each month
* $2667 x 10e6 = 0.05 x BTCMarketCap

Well, we can't know for sure if it is sustainable. Success, death spiral or niche just depends upon user adoption. I disagree that anything substantial needs to happen. If people embrace it, the support will be there. If they don't, then it will fade away. Those facts seem very natural to me. Much like the Internet itself, the value in the network is driven by the number of people using it!


You don't even need 1% of the global economy. Consistent use by even 10 million users would be enough to reach the levels I'm talking about.


I'm confused about this comment. My point was mostly that Bitcoin has at least 10 years before user adoption becomes critical.


People love to have champions. If selling Bitcoin to the highest bidder helps it survive to maturity, then I'm all for it.

Stealing in this case is hard to define. Do you own money sitting on a park bench in Central Park if you're the one who left it there?
Storing bitcoins in an easily-guessed wallet is roughly equivalent to storing cash in a public place. Anyone who sees it there can take it.
Most wallets allow you to import private keys you've generated. Ownership in Bitcoin is equivalent to knowing the private key. That's why you have to pick high-entropy addresses for security.
Also: I don't think the park bench analogy is quite good enough. A better one is this: say you store money in a bank account and then share the routing and account numbers publicly on Facebook. Would you expect to keep your money in that case?

You're better off buying and holding BTC until ASIC hardware saturates and products reach commodity status.

Sometime in the next few years mining will become an easy 5-10% investment with comparatively little risk. The majority of money put into mining by 2020 should be spent on energy; right now it is less than 50% because the hardware is expensive and people are speculating.

It simply isn't going to happen. A Bitcoin private key is a 256-bit number. Nearly all values are valid keys. That means there are about 1.15x10^77 possible keys. EDIT: It turns out that you only need to dupe the 160-bit hash of the public key, which reduces the difficulty a fair amount. It still isn't feasible though.
If generating a bitcoin hash is the same as guessing a private key, then we can guess 20,000 trillion times per second (20 PH/s).
If we used that computational power for *1 billion* years, we would only be ~~0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000054506186%~~ **0.00000000000004318425%** done.

The road to Bitcoin being an everyday currency is going to be bumpy. If you want to represent a world-class economy in terms of Bitcoin, then it has to be worth significantly more than it is today.
There's about $1.3 trillion USD currency in circulation today. Source: 
To rival the US dollar we'd need to see Bitcoins worth $10,000-$50,000 each.
Anyone claiming it can act like a real currency at current valuation levels is crazy. It still has a long way to go.
We're in a bootstrapping phase: volatility isn't a problem. It is part of the long-term solution. If Bitcoin expanded with normal volatility in value at 8% per year, it would take nearly 100 years before it could rival a world economy.
Note: We don't know what Bitcoin's average growth will be - the numbers below are just illustrative of the concept of exponential growth over short time periods.
Consider an asset that grows at 33% per year on average. It wreaks havoc with human psychology.
At 33% average growth, it would only take Bitcoin another 20 years to become a global currency. The problem with 33% average growth is that few people are trained to handle consistent doubling in value of a financial resource in such short periods of time.
It takes the stock market 9 years to double your money (8% per year). That's a long-term average and crashes like 2000 or 2008 can significantly delay your returns. If you time the market wrong, it could take 12 years or more.
Contrast that with 33% growth where doubling your money only takes 3 years. That puts significant pressure on people to take profits. Why wait 12 years for what you can have in 3? Who *wouldn't* sell?
It also creates significant downside for new investors. If you bought at the $1200 peak, you've lost 70% of your value in a little under a year. Who *wouldn't* sell?

It's not just possible, it is mandatory. The public key space is 2^(160), but private keys are in the 2^(256) space. By necessity there will be many, many public key collisions for which two or more private keys produce the same public key.

You're confusing a brain wallet with wallet encryption. A brain wallet like one of the three linked below is vulnerable to someone knowing your passphrase.
Wallet encryption, on the other hand, simply prevents unauthorized access to your private keys. There's generally no relationship between your passphrase and your private keys. You must maintain at least one copy of your wallet at all times, or you'll lose the ability to spend the btc held at addresses in that wallet.
Example Brain Wallet Generators
Brain Wallet Pros and Cons
The advantage of a brain wallet is that you can generate your private key from a known passphrase. You don't need to maintain a copy of your wallet because the passphrase generates it.
The **disadvantage** of a brain wallet ... is that you can generate your private key from a known passphrase. People who pick a weak passphrase have had their funds stolen.
Brain wallets generated offline with sufficient entropy and/or key stretching are a good means of cold storage. Unfortunately, most people are terrible at generating random values. They tend to gravitate towards information that can be found on Facebook.
Electrum is good because it generates a randomized 128-bit seed that is fairly easy to remember. It generates a list of words, very similar to this XKCD: 
Bits of Entropy
When picking a passphrase, regardless of the wallet type, it is important to use a sufficient level of randomness. Electrum uses the minimum required (128 bits). Most brain wallet guides suggest 160 bits (the maximum supported by Bitcoin addresses). Using more than 160 bits is fine, but provides no additional security due to collisions in public keys.

The scale of backups is much different. In the blockchain-based case you only need to backup the keys. That's a much smaller data set than the transaction logs.
Most tip services don't generate new addresses for every transaction, so you don't need to backup nearly as often (just when users create an account).

As bad as the MtGox situation is, you could have easily moved your btc balance to cold storage (or even a wallet application on your phone or PC) months ago. That's the nice thing about Bitcoin: you aren't *required* to trust a third party to hold your balance for you.

Current infrastructure expansion is clearly driven by speculation. My point is that such expansion is a good thing for the long term health of the network. It ensures that capacity is available when transaction volume starts increasing. The hash rate itself has nothing to do with this effect. It's more the net investment in mining. Companies that host mining equipment will have a vested interest in transitioning to handle transactions as the block reward drops.
It is quite possible to predict possible outcomes. If bitcoin continues, it is obvious that transaction fees will account for the majority of mining revenue in the long term. There's no hand waving on that fact. The block reward is intended as a short term incentive to grow the network, which is exactly what it has done.
The disconnect between energy usage and net benefit to society will disappear once the block reward drops below the noise level of transaction volume. That should happen around 2020 if current trends continue.

If your seed phrase provides 160 bits of entropy, then it is _entirely_ equivalent to a random address. It also guarantees that you don't fall victim to a compromised RNG.
You can collect entropy from events like drawing cards from a fully shuffled deck of cards or rolling dice. At that point a brainwallet isn't much of a brain wallet though.

Even without fiat conversion, you could negotiate a loan in terms of the CPI. In essence our current inflationary system already does this, but without any real effort. If I borrow $100K today and repay a total of $180K, I haven't paid $180K in terms of today's dollars. Thirty years from now, 3% inflation will make those dollars worth 60% less. This is why mortgages are a good investment (you need a home and the cost is usually close to the inflation rate).
Similarly, if I took a loan for 20 BTC today, I could require repayment terms that mean I might only repay 5 BTC. The lender doesn't care because 5 future-BTC is worth significantly more than 20 BTC today under a deflationary model.

So you seriously think that Dogecoin, which allows people to have fun together online, is more damaging to Bitcoin gaining mainstream adoption than the Silk Road or online gambling?
I'm inclined to think that Dogecoin is a net positive - it lowers the bar for entry and encourages people to experiment.
Anyone just learning about crypto currency can only earn fractions of a bitcoin or litecoin right now. But they can still have hundreds or thousands of dogecoins to play with.
While we've made the point over and over that units help (mBTC, uBTC), I think there's something to be said for a fun alternative that gets the idea out there.

There's simply nothing you can do about the volatility. The price _does_ matter because it limits what sort of transactions Bitcoin can enable.
If we wanted to use Bitcoin for payroll, for example, we'd need the price to be a lot higher. I'll illustrate with an example below.
1. Let's say that 10 million people want to receive their paychecks in Bitcoin every two weeks.
2. The average salary for each person is $42,000 per year or $1750 per paycheck. Assume 20% withheld for taxes and insurance, so $1400 take-home.
3. The Bitcoin exchange rate is $400/BTC. Close to today's value since you assert that it "doesn't matter".
4. The average paycheck would then be 3.5 btc.
5. That would put a demand of 35 million btc every two weeks on the system. The amount of liquid Bitcoin, even in theory, is well below that number.
Speculators are betting that Bitcoin will become popular enough to reach use cases like the one above. They will drive volatility no matter how you try to control it. There's simply too much growth needed for volatility to be solved right now.

The choice of 256-bit ECDSA was not arbitrary. Elliptic curve security for a given bit length is widely believed to be equal to the security of a symmetric key system with half that number of bits.
This is why Electrum and other wallets use 128 bits of entropy. It matches the expected security rating for the system.
See: 
For a system to be no less secure than 128-bit AES, you need to use a 256-bit ECDSA key or a 3072-bit RSA key.

The possibility increases as more people use Bitcoin, but you have to keep in mind that even 7 billion people is only a factor of 10^(9). A 160-bit public key is about 10^(48).
So you could generate a trillion (10^(12)) addresses per second for *everyone* on the planet and you'd generate 2x10^(29) addresses in a year.

Here's an analysis I wrote about two months ago: 
My conclusion at the time was that energy usage was not a concern and I still think that's the case.
Your first problem, I think, is in anticipating $100K/BTC by 2016. That's extremely bullish and it is the "worst-case" scenario in terms of energy usage.
Your calculation of 29,000 homes is correct assuming 1 watt/GH/s average efficiency. You have to remember that a significant portion of mining revenue is going into hardware right now though, so it's probably more like 10,000 homes for the energy cost. A 2 TH/s Cointerra device costs $6k up-front with about $4-5k in electricity costs over 3 years. That's assuming you can still mine with the thing in 3 years, which may not be true.
I'm not worried about the long-term energy usage because the block reward eventually goes to zero. It will account for less than 1% inflation by 2030.

@_date: 2014-01-19 17:20:11
"Gradually" amounts to annualized 79% growth for the next 15 years. That's hardly gradual.
Two other options:
1. The USD crashes in value, making $2.8 million worthless. This seems unlikely within the next 15 years.
2. The percentage of btc withheld from the market through loss or investment reaches 96.43%. This also seems unlikely. Today we're at 50%, so perhaps 60% is realistic.
Looking at the pie chart linked below, we can see that about 50% of Bitcoins are in active circulation (moved within the last 6 months).
If that gradually decreases to 40% by 2028, then the available supply at that point in time will be 8 million btc. If 1% of 40T is invested in Bitcoin and that 400B is 10% of Bitcoin's total value (4T), then the price would be $500,000 per btc - but not $2.8 million.
But perhaps some mixture of points 1 and 2 can apply. Let's say, for the sake of argument that the dollar is inflated 100% from where it is today (same as 1987-2013 time period). Then, we assume that 80% of btc is unavailable.
Plugging these constraints together, we get: 0.5 x 4.2 million btc x 2.8 million usd/btc = $5.88 trillion "available market cap" in 2013 dollars. In 2028 dollars the "available market cap" would be $11.7 trillion.
The thing is, the media and investors will think in terms of the total supply and report the market cap value. So while a $12T "available market cap" seems feasible from an academic point of view, it wouldn't survive. The news would be reporting a $58.8T market cap at a time when off-shore investments might total $40T.

We won't be creating such a database anytime soon, but the laws of physics don't prevent it.
* Key point: Collisions in the 160-bit public key space are far more likely than the 256-bit private keys suggest
* Conversion to powers of ten: 2^160 ~ 10^48
* [The Milky Way]( is about 10^42 kg
* Using our current tech, we can store about [10^13 bits/kg](
* We may be able to reach [10^25 bits per kg](
* [As of 2013]( our civilization had used nearly 10^25 bits of storage
That puts a range of 10^25 to 10^67 bits that our civilization could make use of without leaving our own galaxy. You only need 10^48 to generate every possible Bitcoin address. Clearly it would be _possible_ without violating the laws of physics. Hopefully we'll have leveled up by then though.

Unrelated except for the discussion of a 160-bit hash collision:
The biggest problem with crypto scale numbers is getting people to grok the sheer size of them.
Each additional bit doubles the address space. With 5 bits I can represent 32 values. Give me 6 bits and I can store 64 values. And so on.
A 32-bit number can represent 4 billion values. A 64-bit number can represent 4 billion sets, each filled with 4 billion numbers.
A 96-bit number can store 4 billion super sets, each with their own 4 billion sets of 4 billion numbers each. Due to rounding error this actually accounts for only 80% of the address space, but you get the idea.
A 128-bit number should make your head explode. Then the 160-bit number comes along and divides what's left into 4 billion pieces.
Hash collisions for truly randomized inputs are exceedingly rare. It isn't magic or pseudo science. The numbers are just so vastly huge that our brains can't handle them very well.

I've been working on a bot that helps decide when to buy and sell. It posts daily advice based upon how the average price has been changing. It allows you to do "better" than DCA in two ways:

This is the bootstrapping phase. Energy usage today is tied to the block reward, which is halved every four years.
Long-term, energy usage will be directly correlated with transaction fees. Thus, energy usage will scale with the economic benefit that the network provides.
In the last year, the network processed about 19 million transactions (0.6 TPS). If the average fee was 0.0005 btc, then total transaction fees were about 9,500 BTC. In the same year, miners earned about 1.3 million BTC.

Compare Bitcoin to cash and I think you'll see why the US government doesn't want to stop Bitcoin.
Bitcoin solves two glaring problems with cash: counterfeiting and traceability. Criminals won't want to use Bitcoin because it gives the DEA and FBI great forensic analysis tools. The government doesn't even have to build public opinion for auditing everyone's transactions because they're already public records with Bitcoin.
The built-in "paper trail" with Bitcoin is even more powerful than tagging cash. The blockchain lets you see who exchanged goods and services along the way. With cash you only get to see who ended up with the money in the end.
Why in the world would the US government want to stop a tool that helps them track spending so easily?

Yes, where "strength" means equivalence with a symmetric cipher like AES.
Using fewer than 128 bits will weaken the security of your private key. Using fewer than 160 bits will mean there are some public addresses that you can't reach.
Since we don't know exactly what the collision space looks like, it makes sense to hedge your bets and provide 160 bits of entropy.
Using 160 bits should improve your odds of avoiding a collision attack where an attacker uses a different private key from your own.

The issue is that once you grant admin privileges for an installer, then *that* installer might install other software in addition to what you actually wanted.
If you don't have access to the source code, then you can't be certain of what is being installed. It's a form of paranoia, but the threat can be real. I write software for a living - it's very easy to bundle additional hidden files or services and deploy them without the user being notified. Phishing attempts often take advantage of this flexibility - once you click beyond the initial security warning all bets are off.

Bitcoin is the world's fastest computing system for computing SHA256^(2) hashes. By far.
Just over a year ago, Bitcoin was *256 times* faster than the Top-500 supercomputers **combined**. That was when the hash rate was nearing a measly 10 PH/s. Today, the network is averaging 275 PH/s.
So today's Bitcoin network is at least **3,000 times** faster than all of our fastest supercomputers (assuming Top-500 capacity doubled). Chew on that for a bit.

It's a very good question. In the short term it simply means that Bitcoin loans won't exist. No one would borrow 1 BTC worth $600 today and pay 1 BTC later at $10,000.
If the end-game happens we'd have to issue loans as a ratio of purchasing power. Even if the USD collapsed and BTC was the last man standing you'd still have to issue loans against an imaginary conversion ratio.
In the US today it is common to take a 30-year mortgage. It generally comes to 10-20% of your yearly salary depending upon your debt ratio elsewhere. You could do the same thing with BTC pretty easily.
If you are paid less BTC due to deflation, then you would also pay less on your mortgage and everything else.
Now, maybe this is a sign that this end-game isn't terribly likely. But it doesn't rule out the idea of loans - the terms would just have to evolve along with it.

You're comparing two *very* different numbers. The 'market cap' of Bitcoin doesn't represent anything close to the amount of money invested in Bitcoin.
The market cap is really a fake number to begin with. Satoshi owns about 1 million bitcoins, but paid practically nothing for them. When the price went to $1000/BTC, those coins were "worth" $1 billion USD.

5,000 words of bullshit costs a minimum-wage worker about $6.67 to produce:

* 50 minutes = 0.833 hours
* $8/hr x 0.833 hours = $6.67
Refuting 5,000 words of bullshit requires time to read, fact-find, dispute and respond. It also requires someone earning more than minimum wage in most cases, so I'll include that in the calculation.
* Read 5,000 words: 25 minutes
* Fact Finding: 10 minutes
* Dispute: 10 minutes
* 5,000 word response: 50 minutes
* Hours needed: 1.58 hours
* Total Cost: $15/hr x 1.58 hours = $23.75

Coinbase charges 1% for the vendor and 1% for the buyer if they didn't already have Bitcoin. Are your credit card processing fees lower than 2% already?

There are some key differences with bitcoin though.
1. It isn't a stock. You can exchange it directly for goods and services without waiting for a broker to sell it for you. Less true today since vendors don't hold btc yet.
2. The logical conclusion of a successful bitcoin experiment is that all wealth is expressed in terms of it. No one would ever consider using GOOG as a currency, but BTC has a chance.
3. We have decent estimates of price ceilings based upon market factors such as energy usage and money supply. Once we've reached those price points, the peak will be obvious immediately.

On January 1, 2013 the price was $13. That's when about 50% of all BTC was mined. If miners didn't hold, then they sold well below today's rate. Anecdotally: I know a guy who had about 100 BTC from mining. He sold when it "spiked" to $10. Oops.
Today they're mining 10% or less per year. Between 2013 and 2030 miners will only create as much BTC as they did in the first 4 years.
If you're concerned about people receiving a disproportionate reward, then I think you should be worried about the very early adopters more than today's "colluding" miners.

It all depends upon how this drives growth in usage.
If a static number of people are using bitcoin and they only spend bitcoin without buying more, then the price would fall.

If more consumers start using bitcoin, then the price will rise.

Your assumption that owning 5% of the total hash rate implies a 5% double-spend rate is just plain wrong.
Confirmations significantly reduce the risk of a dishonest miner. Check the table on page 10 of the second source link for details.
At 5% of the total hash rate, a miner has basically no chance of getting a successful double-spend (less than 0.003%).
An attacker would need about 24% of the total hash rate to net a 5% chance of getting a double-spend with 6-confirmation transactions.

The main page could, for example, pick a weak target key and simply mutate it less and less until you've moved your mouse enough. Without inspecting the code you wouldn't be able to tell.
But with the brain wallet function you can easily verify using separate tools (any sha256sum program and any bitcoin program that allows you to directly enter a private key) that it generates the specific random key that you found via your dice rolls.
Once you've validated a copy of the site and tested it with a throwaway address, you can then be confident that subsequent brain wallets, generated with enough entropy, are secure.

As pointed out below, the buy-sell-hold strategy is something I'm developing. I'm using a smoothed 60-day exponential moving average to detect local maximums and minimums.
I need to write a blog post up about it, which I'll do after finishing the next iteration of the algorithm. The goal, in essence, is to help you detect medium-term behavior to lower your cost basis.
I last bought at the beginning of October for $310. I last sold a few weeks ago around $400. I started posting after my last buy, so I haven't posted any buys yet.

At the current average (10x/year) the price would hit $100m in 5 years. I agree that is highly unlikely.

I don't think there are any shipping yet. Here's a pre-order device that claims to offer 5 MH/s at 70 watts:
For comparison, an R9 280X nets 0.7 MH/s at about 270 watts.
5000 kH / 70 watts = 71.4 kH/watt
700 kH / 270 watts = 2.6 kH/watt
So the Viper will be about 28x more efficient than a GPU when it ships. How long you'll have to wait for that and what sort of volume it has is anyone's guess.
1 year TCO Comparison
Viper @ 5 MH/s: $2245 + 613 kwh ~ $2306
8x AMD R9 280X @ 5.6 MH/s: $3200 + 17531 kwh ~ $4953

We disagree there. Increased vendor adoption is a precursor to user adoption. Also, daily transaction volume has been growing, albeit slowly.


Yes, but it doesn't change the outcome. Your consciousness wouldn't exist without a brain. Does that make you any less real?


It's very few because we're in a bootstrapping phase. Why would you expect user adoption to come *before* vendor adoption? I'd be much more worried about Bitcoin if 50m people were already using it today.


No, it isn't. A horse growing wings without genetic engineering is basically impossible. But 10 million people adopting Bitcoin because it works better than what they have (i.e. nothing) is very plausible.


You're assuming that everyone who was invested in Bitcoin at that point would just sit idly by and watch it die. With every new actor in the ecosystem, that future becomes less likely. Dogecoin has already faced this problem and decided to become dwindling-inflationary in order to survive. Now Bitcoin is adopting "bits" so people can tip silly amounts of money online. Dogecoin did that first too. What makes you think Bitcoin wouldn't go inflationary if its survival depended upon it?

It would cost about $600m to execute such an attack right now: 
Most likely the community would handle it by introducing a hard-fork to checkpoint us back into the correct fork.
If a nefarious group were to execute a prolonged attack against the network, then they'd have to be quite well-funded. It's probably cheaper to buy advertising to discourage use of Bitcoin.

Replace Bitcoin with something like a Nigerian email scam. That's probably how your bank views it.
That image won't improve until the price stabilizes, which won't happen until 2020 at the earliest. An investment that dips from $1200 to $500 in the space of months encourages people to lose their shirts.

It isn't just theoretical. It is _mandatory_. For every public key there are likely many collisions. For every address there could be 2^256 / 2^160 = 2^96 private keys that map to it.

So far it appears that your experiment is a success. The thing is, protecting $400 is much easier than protecting $1,000,000.
Assuming an adversary wants to collect a 10% return and spend up to 200 kwh solving your problem, there's not much room for profit.
If I spend 4 hours coding a solution, then I might be able to earn $95/hour if I'm successful. That's hardly a competitive rate for work that has no guarantee of a return at all.
If you were protecting $1m then I'd have the opportunity to earn $237,000 per hour. That's much better incentive!

The primary thing your bank cares about is preserving your balance while possibly growing its value. I'm saying we can't fix the problem until the market rate stabilizes.

As pointed out probably 100 times before, not if you just spend and re-buy. Since vendors are doing this in reverse (accepting and immediately selling), then there's no net demand on BTC and the price is free to rise without impacting users or vendors in a material way.
I spend 0.4 BTC for $320 worth of product at Overstock.com. They immediately cash that in for $320, paying Coinbase 1%.
I then purchase 0.4 BTC from Coinbase for say $318, including their 1% fee.
At the end of the day, Coinbase has saved the merchant 2% on fees and made 2% on a transaction where Visa or Mastercard would have made 3%.
Since I filled the demand for my own order, there's no net demand on the network and the price doesn't budge.

Here's an estimate: 
Finding collisions in the 160-bit public key space via brute-force is relatively easy when you're considering a timescale that large (at least [10^(100) years]( Also, the security of Bitcoin private keys is only equivalent to 128-bit symmetric keys.
We'd need to devote a Milky-Way-sized computer to the task for a few years. And we have plenty of galaxies to choose from.

The block reward is configured to provide incentive doing the bootstrapping phase. The reward is halved every 210,000 blocks - which works out to about every 4 years if the mining target holds at 10 minutes per block (we've been averaging a little less due to massive hash rate growth).
By 2025, the block reward will be 3.125 BTC. That makes it more economically feasible for Bitcoin to grow. If the hash rate grows at say 15% per year, it will be about 1200 PH/s in 2025. Let's say that mining efficiency is the primary cause for hash rate growth over the next 10 years, so we're using mining hardware with 0.15 watts/GH/s. That works out to about 180,000 kWh. Assuming 3% growth in USD per year (inflation), that puts us at $23,400 per hour in mining costs to earn 3.125 BTC.
If miners take 10% profit, then BTC could be worth $8,320 at a minimum. That puts yearly growth for BTC/USD at just under 40% - which seems fairly reasonable, if somewhat bearish compared to its history thus far.
All of that assumes many things:
0. Bitcoin survives
0. Mining is a limiting factor on the price
0. Energy doesn't become ridiculously cheap (via Fusion)
0. Major advances in Bitcoin mining don't happen (ASIC is "the final frontier")
0. We keep the current halving schedule

The assymetry in bit length is a consequence of the algorithms used for [public key cryptography]( The reason why we can't construct a private key from the address is due to one-way hashing functions - not the bit length of the respective keys.
If you wanted to reverse-engineer a private key from a bitcoin address, you'd have to break all 3 algorithms (RIPEMD160, SHA256 and ECDSA).
* 
* 
Bitcoin Address Generation
1. Create an ECDSA key pair: the public key here is larger than the private key, but that's not why you can't derive the private key from the public key - it is just a consequence of the math.
2. Perform SHA256 on the public key
3. Perform RIPEMD-160 on that hash
4. Add a version number and hash with SHA256 _twice_
5. Append the first 4 bytes of that value as a checksum for the RIPEMD-160 hash
6. Use that value as the address in base 58
The net effect of those one-way hash functions is that even if ECDSA were broken, you still wouldn't be able to compute the private key from the address alone.

Everything I've read has stressed that Bitcoin is volatile and prone to massive swings in price. But I believe in it still - there's a ton of evidence showing it is moving forward. For that reason I'm willing to weather the short-term price drops (since I can't predict when they'll come).

Yeah, 0-confirmation transactions are much easier to double-spend.
In regards to your question, though, it seems likely that companies with a vested interest in earning mining profits would collude to perform a "51% attack" that discards those blocks.
It wouldn't be cost-effective to invest the money for 5% of the global hash rate only to have your solved blocks blacklisted.
It really boils down to whether or not a majority of the companies involved in mining want to profit from the Bitcoin network or not. Majority double-spending would undermine the very reason for their existence and drive Bitcoin to extinction.
Minority double-spending behavior can be detected and treated like spam. Costs rise, but only the honest miners continue to generate revenue.

Hmm I haven't thought too much about the latency problem. You could solve that by requiring blocks to handle at least 50% of outstanding transactions (block size permitting, of course).
Is there anything showing that larger blocks take more time to mine? You can't predict sha256^(2), but it would slow iterations. The attempts for small and large blocks aren't similar though, so it's hard to compare hashing attempts for them.

The network has to grow in capacity *before* transaction volume catches up with it, or the network could fail.

Intelligence isn't the same thing as experience. Intelligence is a measure of how quickly you can grok new ideas. Experience is the accumulation of concepts over time. Try as you might, you probably won't perform better than someone with significantly more experience than you.
I don't know what your education level is, but think of velocity and position. Intelligence is a measure of your velocity. Experience is a measure of your position. If you've been traveling along at 100 km/h for 10 years, then you've covered 8.8m kilometers. Now imagine someone traveling at only 60 km/h for 20 years. They've covered 10.5m kilometers. You'll overtake them *soon*, but they're still *ahead* of you right now.

There's a huge difference between Infinite and infinite. You seem to be hung up on Infinite: the idea that, yes, there are some numbers which can't be represented on a computer. But those numbers are so astronomically large that they don't matter for human timescales. See: 
Today we use 8 decimal places to represent Bitcoin values (a total of about 16 digits as measured in Satoshis). That fits within a 64-bit integer or a double floating-point value, as recommended by 
Larger integers are entirely feasible, as are new units. Sure, it isn't "Infinite", but that doesn't matter because we'll never have to worry about running out of digits.

Faster ASIC hardware won't be an order of magnitude more efficient, so the hash rate won't continue to grow at the same rate per node as it did in 2013.
A $300 ASIC is easily 20x faster than a GPU. That's like seeing four years of price-performance doubling in one upgrade cycle.

I've taken to heart a lesson from Ray Kurzweil: change is accelerating and improvements which align themselves with the price-performance curve of technology are good bets.
When the Bitcoin network started exploding in processing capacity last year, I took notice. I had seen it on Slashdot before but I had been busy with Starcraft II...
At any rate, I think the fact that the Bitcoin network has slurped up more CPU cycles than any other computing system in history is a clear indicator of being "on the right track".

That's a very good point. If non-rational actors even number 15% of the population, they could easily overwhelm reason with this strategy.
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:23:04
It's a decent idea, but let's consider how many people are going to take advantage of it and see what could happen.
I'm going to make some bullish assumptions to over-estimate the impact, by design.
Assumptions for the Sake of Argument
1. Every subscriber to is American, middle-upper class earning $60,000 per year.
2. They all receive a $2000 tax refund.
3. They all spend 100% of it on Bitcoin.
4. They all file on April 15th and receive their refunds on April 25th (very unlikely).
5. The price on April 25th is $900/BTC.
So, we now have a demand spike of 220,000 btc (2000/900x100,000). That's about 10X average trading volume right now. This is the worst-case scenario for price fluctuation.
If we relax constraint  and model tax refunds being distributed evenly over a period of 4 weeks, then the extra daily demand drops to 7,000 btc.
This could be absorbed by daily trading volume (which is ~20,000 btc) pretty easily.
TL;DR: I think it could have a minor impact, but nothing huge (in a Bitcoin volatility sense).

Scarcity purity isn't really a thing. Either a resource is scarce or it isn't. If we discover easily-mined space rocks with huge stores of gold, gold will become plentiful and unsuitable for investment overnight. (Unless of course the gold majority funds a gold mining company to keep it artificially scarce...)
I think the bigger problem to worry about is whether or not transaction volume increases to a sustainable level before the coinbase reward falls below a profitable level.
At that point miners would have an incentive to drive transaction fees up, which could adversely affect the network.

It depends upon how much you trust a truly global market.
Imagine if 2 billion Internet users become involved with Bitcoin. They might do a better job of keeping prices in check than a handful of regulators.
I view this argument against crypto currency and Bitcoin much like the idea that everyone will one day just stop using the Internet. Maybe that argument held water in 1994 (after all, who uses Prodigy or AOL these days). But 20 years later, it's obvious that the Internet is here to stay.

Correct. You can't pack more than 160 bits of entropy into the public key, so those produce the same effective result: a private key that is no weaker than the public key.
The general idea is that while Method 1 may produce a stronger private key, it isn't actually more secure because a collision will be found well before the "real" private key is found.

I'm not prominent by any means, but I've recently started building a twitter advice bot that watches medium-term trends in the Bitcoin price. You can view my daily advice here: 
I need to write a blog post about how my model works, but it essentially boils down to waiting for critical points in the derivative of the 60-day EMA. When those points are reached, I compare the current price to the EMA. If the price is above the EMA, I sell some btc. If the price is below the EMA, I buy.
Most of the time I hold, and I also keep a minimum BTC balance to avoid missing a critical user adoption spike no matter what.
My strategy isn't focused on trading profit directly - it's designed to reduce my cost basis over time. I want to hold my BTC as cheaply as possible to reduce my investment risk.
A recent example from my model:
* On Oct 6 I bought some btc for $310/BTC because my model predicted a local minimum in the price
* On Oct 25 I decided to start posting advice via twitter
* On Nov 12, my model triggered a soft sell notice
* I sold some of my bitcoin from that Oct 6 purchase at a 30% profit
* I now have a smaller amount of Bitcoin that effectively cost me $166/BTC
I didn't have to 'time the market' because I'm only projecting a very small amount of time forward. I just take advantage of local highs and lows as they come along.

Averaging over a 2-day period is probably more accurate for showing fluctuation not due to chance (either in block finds or network connectivity issues):
Estimated Dips (PH/s):
    Nov-20: 0.5
    Nov-28: 0.3
    Dec-9: 0.5
    Dec-13: 0.5
    Dec-30: 1.2
Estimated Peaks (PH/s):
    Nov-18: 1.4
    Nov-30: 1.0
    Dec-8: 1.0
    Dec-11: 1.5
    Dec-16: 1.0
    Dec-20: 1.2
    Dec-28: 0.9
    Jan-1: 1.5
    Jan-7: 1.5
    Jan-12: 1.0
Note that 1 PH/s is unaccounted for in my estimates because I didn't catalog every peak and dip. The numbers above estimate about 90% of the variation in the last 60 days.
A couple of trends are obvious:
1. The hash rate usually rebounds within 2 days of a dip.
2. There are more peaks than dips.
3. The peaks are almost always bigger than the dips.
Thus, it is likely that the variation in hash rate over the last few months is due to hardware upgrades being installed.

This seems likely. Bitpay works best with a mobile wallet - you scan the QR code and pay the exact amount requested. They're storing both the bitcoin address and the payment amount in that image.

I don't see your logic: if you put that 1% into predictable assets that grow 4% per year that money will be tied up and you'll have perhaps 1.6% after 12 years (1.04^12 ~ 1.60).
That's not going to fund much because our 3% average inflation will make the money worth 43% less anyway. So it's more like having an extra 12%. If you argue for an 8% return via the stock market, then that isn't a guaranteed-profitable investment over a 12 year period either.
I also disagree with your assertion that Bitcoin is the same risk as the long odds in Vegas. The price has not dropped below the prior average after any period of growth. Today's $625 would be sky-high a year ago when the price was closer to $100.
Example of "Vegas Long Odds": 
The risk for gambling in a scenario like that is huge - you either win or lose immediately following the game. There's no chance to back out or to cut your losses.
Thus far Bitcoin has never collapsed, which means that you're unlikely to lose everything unless _everyone else_ does too. The more people who join the network, the less likely that scenario becomes.

It looks like you meant to use 0.75 watts/GH as your conversion factor. That's fine, but you have some errors in your math. I've followed your method with corrections below.
Doing the calculations correctly
Assume: The bitcoin network is processing 35,000,000 GH/s at an efficiency of 0.75 watts/GH/s.
The first error you made was in calculating the number of hashes per block. It should have been 21,000 petahashes.
35e6 GH/s x 60 s/min x 10 min/block = 21e9 GH/block
Now, we want to calculate how much energy each block requires, so we can calculate the energy cost. A watt is defined as 1 Joule per second. You multiply watts by time to get energy (joules or kwh).
A block takes, on average, about 10 minutes to compute. We'll calculate our hourly energy usage and then divide by 6 to arrive at the per-block value, measured in kwh.
35e6 GH/s x 0.75 watts/(GH/s) x (1 kilowatt / 1000 watts) = 26,250 kilowatts
26,250 kilowatts x 1 hour = 26,250 kilowatt-hours.
26,250 kwh / 6 blocks = 4375 kwh per block. That's only about $525 per block.
Now, network efficiency isn't that good yet. This is a lower bound on how much miners are spending because they aren't all using the most power-efficient hardware yet.

I found a four-part technical description of the ACH process posted by Zen Payroll in April through September of 2014. The description makes it plain that transfers can't be instant (*by design*).


What you're seeing is that the OFDI updates the account before the transfer has actually settled.
While it would be technically possible for the Federal Reserve to speed up processing, it would be expensive to rewrite the existing (working) system. The standards organization that manages the ACH protocol is apparently working on same-day transfers, but it will take time for banks to update their systems to adopt it.
Part 3 is particularly interesting because it outlines a 4-day transfer scenario. The author even references Bitcoin as a way to reduce transfer delay.

One thing you want to keep in mind with dollar-cost-averaging is the price of trading. If you can buy for a flat fee or no fee, then a daily buy makes sense.
Coinbase isn't very economical at $10; they'll charge you $0.15, or **1.5 percent**. If you buy $100, they'll charge you $1, or **1 percent**. If you buy a total of $300 in daily increments, you'll spend $4.50 in fees versus $3 in fees if you had bought in increments of at least $100.
Circle doesn't charge a fee at all, so you may want to look into using them for a daily buy.
Finally, a shameless plug for my twitter bot:
I wanted a better way to buy and sell than dollar-cost-averaging, so I'm currently working on an automated advice bot that tracks a 30-day smoothed EMA to identify local minimums and maximums. You can use that advice to decide if buying, selling or holding today is a "smart move". 
If you need to build your BTC balance, you can buy in higher amounts than you sell. You might buy 1.0 btc and sell 0.5 btc, for example. In my case I also set a minimum BTC reserve, so I don't blindly follow the advice I generate and miss **the spike**.
It beats DCA because it profits from volatility. In the last two months, Bitcoin has ranged from about $310 to $440. If you use DCA, you might get 2 btc for an average of $360/BTC, spending $720. If you use my method (1 x 310 - 0.5 x 425), you might get 0.5 btc at an average of $200/BTC, spending $100. You wind up risking less, with a lower cost basis.

Doge has a long way to go before it can even be considered, but that's beside the point.
Of the current set of altcoins, I think Ripple has the best *chance* of displacing Bitcoin (though I doubt it can).

If you track customers by account or shipping info, then you could mitigate the effects of 0-conf problems by assigning a reputation score to them.
* New customers must wait for at least 6 confirmations
* Second-time customers wait for 1 confirmation
* Repeat customers can use 0-conf
If you're using 2FA, this should significantly reduce your risk in accepting 0-conf payments from repeat customers. If you ever see a customer with 0-conf status stealing from you, then you just bump them to the confirmation bracket.

Yes, a stable exchange rate is desirable. I view price and transaction stability in the face of Mt.Gox's failure as a success story in itself.

You should be able to find the power output stats on the product page.
    +3.3V +5V +12V -12V +5VSB
It's much more important to look at the +12V total output. In this case your power supply can provide up to 792 watts (12V x 66A = 792 watts).
Keep in mind that your CPU and other system components draw a fair amount of power too (100-200 watts typically).
Giving yourself a 250 watt cushion, that leaves 542 watts.
According to  the power draw under load for an R9 270X is about 150 watts or less. Note: Overclocking increases power usage.
That leaves 542 - 150 - 150 = 242 watts for your GTX 780. That's not nearly enough if your card is like this one: 
That page recommends 500 watts devoted to the 780. Also note that your PSU might not have enough PCIe power connectors for 3 GPUs.
TL;DR: No, buy a 1200 watt power supply or augment your existing one.

It doesn't add any bits. Entropy depends upon the minimum encoding length needed to represent the possible values. It doesn't matter what symbols you attach to those values. What matters is the minimum possible encoding.
Your answer also doesn't take into account the dwindling supply of cards. After 20 cards you can represent the remaining cards with 5 bits. After 36 cards you only need 4 bits for the remaining cards.
That's why a full deck provides 52! ~ 8x10^67 values (just shy of 226 bits).
If you sum bit lengths for each range of draws, you'll see what I mean:
    52 - 32: 5.35 bits / draw x 21 ~ 112 bits
    31 - 16: 4.5 bits / draw x 16 ~ 72 bits
    15 -  8: 3.5 bits / draw x 8 ~ 28 bits
    7  -  4:  2.5 bits / draw x 4 ~ 10 bits
    3  -  2: 1.5 bits / draw x 2 ~ 3 bits
          1: 1 bit x 1 ~ 1 bit
That gives a result of 226 bits for a full deck, which agrees with the equation I gave in my answer (52!).

Re: Your 4-cent router: The cost of devices doesn't go down exponentially - you just get more features or capacity for your dollar. Hard drives have been hovering around $100 for the last 15 years, for example.
For your scenario of 810,000 TPS we'd need to store about 400 MB/sec (0.5 KB / transaction). Each block would be roughly 240 GB. Over the course of a year, we would accumulate about 12,600 TB. Today that would cost you about $472,500. By 2025, that cost should be down to about $1,000. By 2030 it should be below $30.
My point is the same: by the time it matters, storage is simply not a problem.
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:16:05
The table above already answers your question. I'll try to explain better.
Every time you draw a card you need to find the minimum number of bits required to represent your remaining population. At 52 cards you need 6 bits, but some of the address space is wasted because 53-63 are invalid.
Once you've drawn 20 cards, you now only need 5 bits to represent the population (2^5 = 32).
In my table above I calculated average number of bits for each group, taking into account the invalid values once you move on to the next card.
For the same reason that you need slightly fewer than 6 bits to represent a set of 52 cards, you also need slightly fewer than 4 bits to represent 13 cards.
You can calculate the number of bits required to represent the population for the nth drawing as log(52 - N) / log(2). I'd write log-base-2 if I could.
To make the example concrete:
    1st card: 5.7 bits
    2nd card: 5.67 bits
    3rd card: 5.64 bits
    ...
    19th card: 5.04 bits
    20th card: 5 bits
In practice you have to round up because fractions of a bit don't make sense. But you don't round up until you've summed the bits required for all of your draws. Hence you need ~108 bits for the first 20 cards, not 119 bits.
You can verify this using the equation I gave earlier. 2^108 is just slightly more than 52! / (52 - 20)!.

It all depends upon whether or not Bitcoin hits the big time. If it becomes a stable currency with even a 1 trillion dollar market cap, then 1 BTC has to be worth $47,000. That much isn't in dispute.
What is in dispute is whether or not Bitcoin will ever get that far.
Altcoins are essentially pure speculation, while Bitcoin has a viable economy being built up. Most of Bitcoin's value right now is speculation as well, but that is only a means to the end goal.

The mining reward, even with the halving schedule, should be sufficient to protect the Bitcoin network through about 2025-2030.
We wouldn't need much speculation (in relation to Wall street volumes) to drive the price high enough to keep mining revenues profitable for many years to come. The BTC reward halves every 4 years, but growth in BTC valuation could lead to higher mining revenues (measured in US dollars).
As more VC money flows into Bitcoin startups, the chance of either rapid user adoption or a VC-funded bailout seems very likely. Of course, several massive crashes along the way seem likely as well.

2. Bitcoin provides a permanent cash paper trail, which is important for FBI and law enforcement.
3. Bitcoin uses an elliptic curve not tainted by the NSA - see

His core point was correct: there's no exponential growth in users so far. But he backed it up with poor data. The date range was too limited and the use of BTC as the unit was also misleading. Even if you expand the date range, the exponential growth in BTC price will distort the chart.

Checkpoints and pruning are two ways to consolidate the size of the blockchain. See: 
At Visa scale (2,000 TPS) you might want to store something on the order of 8 megabits/second of data.
In a year's time you'd consume about 32 TB of data. That's about $1200 in SATA drives (8x 4TB).

I used to think this way too, but that's not how markets work. The market price is always for a subset of the total available.
If you try to buy an additional $100m worth of Bitcoin, you'll drive the price up. Bitstamp averages about 21,675 BTC a day. It would take a week of double the average volume to execute a $100m buy order. People would notice that sort of traffic immediately and the price would climb.
Think about it this way: Satoshi has about 980K BTC. Do you think he paid $600 million for it? The price isn't a direct reflection of how much money has been paid into the system.

Another factor that you should consider is how much you trust your software to produce a random key.
With a brain wallet you can perform a process that _you control_, such as shuffling a deck of cards 7 or more times. You can then extract entropy from that process. If you write down at least 31 cards from a well-shuffled deck, you can provide more than enough entropy for a public key. See: 
This makes your wallet immune to low-entropy bugs, because you aren't trusting the machine to provide good entropy for you.

I'm taking the position that as mining hardware gets more specialized, it will be held primarily by companies with business plans, as opposed to college dorms filled with GPUs.
That trend leads toward shareholder responsibility. If I invest $30m in a mining company, then I'll want to see a solid plan for remaining profitable. The only way to do that long term is through transaction fees.

Let's break your problem down:
1. How many machines are operating?
2. What is the average watts/GH/s rating?
The first question is largely derived from the global hash rate divided by available mining hardware, so we'll focus on question 
Almost All Mining Hardware Is New
You can assume that mining hardware purchased more than 1 year ago is obsolete. No one is mining Bitcoin with CPUs or GPUs anymore because they're no longer profitable.
Even ASIC hardware isn't immune to the difficulty challenge: a 7 GH/s BFL Jalapeno makes about $25/month now (source:  That's roughly 10% of the acquisition cost. Even if the network hash rate remained constant, it would take nearly a year to make your investment back.
Upper Limit on Efficiency Rating
A BFL Jalapeno runs at about 50w, for an efficiency rating of about 7 watts/GH/s. We can assume that very few miners are operating at a profit level lower than this.
The average efficiency will close in on and drop below 1 watts/GH/s fairly quickly. Cointerra offers a 2000 GH/s miner that draws about 2000 watts (source:  I've seen some people claim it is only 1.5 watts/GH/s, but that's still much better than BFL's hardware.
Lower Bound on Number of Miners
At 20,000 TH/s we're looking at something on the order of 10,000 "Cointerra units" worth of hashing power. This is a lower bound on the number of miners in operation.
I found this website which aims to track the number of Bitcoin nodes:  It is showing about 100,000 active nodes.
BitMinter is a smaller pool with 370 TH/s capacity and 8000 users. That works out to 46 GH/s per user (source: 
Bringing it All Together
So we have a low estimate of 7 GH/s per miner and a high estimate of 2,000 GH/s per miner. This means there are somewhere between 2.8 million and 10,000 active miners.
My best guess is that the number is close to 100 GH/s per miner for a total of 200,000 miners.

Perhaps you can explain why you think this would be helpful. What problem are you trying to solve?
Coinbase already guarantees exchange rates for vendors over single transactions.
You can't reduce volatility in Bitcoin by forcing a price disparity from the market rate.
If there were enough uninformed people to support such a situation, the most likely outcome is causing the price to swing +/- $300 or more.
If the price is low, just buy and then sell on Bitstamp.
If the price is high, just buy on Bitstamp and sell on Coinbase.
But news of the deal would quickly spread and Coinbase would run out of coins daily.
Maybe they could do it for a short period of time through VC funding, but it would be a terrible business model long-term.

Try to think long-term. The inflationary phase is fair and distributes the cost of running the network to everyone.
By 2030, Bitcoin inflation will be below 1% per year. It continues to get cheaper after that, eventually guaranteeing that the cost is proportional to the net benefit to society (via transaction fees).
If Bitcoin hits a $2 trillion market cap in 2030, the cost to run the network will be $20 billion that year. Contrast this to the USD today. We spend well in excess of $80 billion a year to prop it up. If you earned $30,000 a year in 2008 you need to earn $32,600 in 2014 just to break even.

It would be relatively easy to support an in-progress transaction that delays output until a confirmation transaction is submitted. It would double the blockchain cost, but would prevent undesired transfers.

This way you wouldn't need an expiration timer either.

Miners are enabling a payment network that is orders of magnitude more trustworthy and efficient than anything else we have to date.
The energy cost (without new technologies like nuclear fusion) will provide downward pressure on the price until the block reward drops out of the equation.
He's bringing up fiat because even a price of $95,000/BTC by 2030 only means that we'll be paying about $20 billion a year to support the network. Contrast that with our $60-80 billion a year for the USD. It would be cheaper to operate the Bitcoin network at those rates.

Not even when using ASIC hardware can it be done economically. It's like trying to find the same molecule of water in an ocean twice. Technically it is possible; if you choose water near the shore, it is easy. That's where good entropy comes into play.

The network transaction fee is not part of your payment. It is a fee that goes to the miners, not Bitpay. Perhaps that is part of your confusion?
There are two different fees:
1. Payment processor fee: subtracted from the vendor's sale. This fee is collected by Bitpay. If your vendor accepted Bitcoin directly, then this fee wouldn't exist.
2. Bitcoin network fee: added to the customer's payment to support the network. This fee is collected by Bitcoin miners.

I think a death spiral at this point is unlikely. There's a lot of VC money flowing into Bitcoin startups - if the network appeared to be in danger we would likely see efforts to prop it up.
Also, it seems unlikely, but there's precedent for changing the block reward rules to avoid a death spiral. Take Dogecoin, for instance. That altcoin instituted a mining incentive of 5 billion DOGE per year *and* merge-mining with Litecoin to stay alive. It's working so far.

The realistic saturation price for Bitcoin, if it succeeds, is in the $100K range. That means your 16 BTC later could be worth another $1.6m down the road. Or it could be worth $0 if Bitcoin fails.
But you still have your $990K today.

They don't use the blockchain for individual transactions because the Bitcoin network isn't tuned for micro-transactions. The fact that you can effortlessly integrate with Bitcoin to offer such a service is part of why many people feel Bitcoin is special and/or magical.
I'll defend the lack of micro-transaction support in Bitcoin using the development of railroad in the United States for reference.
Before the advent of the railroad, getting goods across long distances was a slow and arduous process. See: 
A trip from New York to San Francisco on a wagon train could easily take 6 months, depending upon the weather and your luck. Once the trans-continental railroad was finished, that trip only took 10 days.
The railroad wasn't the best way to travel across town. A horse or your own two feet were the best choice. But people didn't claim the railroad was useless because of that fact. It was obviously better for the job it was intended to solve.
You should look at tipping and micro-transactions in a similar light I think.

Odds of generating a duplicate bitcoin address: 47m / 2^160 or about 1 in 31,095,780,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.
**TL;DR:** That's about the same as a single powerball ticket winning the jackpot for at least *4 consecutive drawings*.

Right - but there's no need for transaction fees to replace the block reward in the near term.
If Bitcoin achieved world-class currency status by 2040:
* 1 BTC would be worth about $100,000 USD ($2 trillion cap)
* The block reward would be worth $19,531 or just over $1 billion/year.
* About $40 trillion/year in payments, possibly more (20x ratio)
* Assuming 0.1% in transaction fees, that's about 40 billion/year.
* At that point, tx fees would be 40x higher than the block reward
Velocity in M1 USD supply had been increasing at a rate of about 2% per year between 1960 and 2009 (the ratio increased from 4 to 10). 
If we take the view that Bitcoin would continue the velocity trend, then we can extrapolate the velocity ratio in 2040: 20. Bitcoin is transferred in a matter of hours instead of days, so this seems quite reasonable. As automation continues to speed up the world, our economy should speed up as well.

Bitcoin isn't subject to this constraint. No matter how many times you divide it in half, you can _always_ divide it again. There are numerous ways to manage infinite division, but the key point is that nothing prevents us from doing it.

It doesn't affect mining at all, other than the storage cost. Each block keeps a hash of the prior block, so they become a constant-time cost in the long-run.
More likely it will lead to a protocol change that allows miners to ignore and prune such spam in the future.

I read the book because I wanted to find a well-reasoned counter argument for my enthusiasm for Bitcoin. The author claims to have approached Bitcoin with open arms, but his stance is clear from the beginning. I found his coverage of bitcoin wanting.
The biggest problem I have with BitCon is the complete lack of source data. There's not a single paper, web site, or shred of verifiable evidence. The author wants you to waste an afternoon allowing to him pontificate about how free markets are horrible.
To be fair, he watched as silk road and mtgox went down. Given his history of exposing criminal activity, his conclusion is pre-determined.
His stance is completely unimaginative. He sees Bitcoin 2014, not Bitcoin 2020 or 2025. He seems to think the blockchain can exist without mining or currency. He clearly has an agenda and can't be reasoned with.
There's no reason to read his book if you've been following Bitcoin for more than a few months. Otherwise, it's a decent history lesson, but his conclusion is unwarranted and premature.

Well let's see...without referencing Coindesk...
0. Prior to the introduction of ASIC hardware, the Bitcoin network was dominated by general-purpose (FPGA and GPU) hardware.
1. ASIC hardware wasn't available in volume until mid-2013 at the earliest. The first to ship, Avalon, shipped their first batch in January.
2. The hash rate in May 2013 surpassed 1 exaFLOPS, or about 80 TH/s. In January it was 20 TH/s, or about 0.25 exaFLOPS.
3. The combined Top500 supercomputers hit 0.25 exaFLOPS in November, 2013.
4. It was estimated that Google had perhaps 0.04 exaFLOPS in March, 2012. Even if that estimate was off by a factor of 10 and then doubled in 2013, it still doesn't compare.
So, without parroting Coindesk, we can see that the Bitcoin network exceeded the processing power of other major systems on the planet well before the introduction of ASIC hardware.
I'm sorry to hear that you have a closet full of useless ASIC hardware. That really does suck. :(

You don't have to day-trade to reduce your cost basis. You can "month-trade" by looking at a smoothed version of the price. It removes emotion from your buy or sell choices.
I publish a daily rating here:  I haven't indicated a buy for this dip yet because the average I'm tracking is still up at $320 - so even with the price at $240 the average would be falling too fast to buy.
I think a lot of people who got into Bitcoin last year are in the same boat - wanting to stay invested but their cost basis is too high. If you trade, you can profit from the volatility now.
Note: If you follow my advice, make sure you set a minimum BTC reserve so you don't miss "the spike".

Short-term stability is one thing, but the current price simply isn't high enough for global commerce. Speculators are "banking" on that fact, which means price stability will continue to come in waves.
Say you want to pay one million workers the equivalent of $1000 every two weeks. Right now you'd need 1.6 million BTC, which means you'd be holding something like 3 million BTC (23% of available supply). That much demand would spike prices like crazy.

The reason why Bitcoin would be considered a threat instead of an opportunity for them is because you can't control the supply. They might be able to hold a majority of the available Bitcoin, but they can't just print more as needed.
There are a lot of people who've spent their entire lives trying to keep economic growth in check. So they see Bitcoin as a step backwards, not forward.

Many algorithms use a heuristic, for example: [A* Search](
Let's say that you had an oracle and you could predict every single peak and valley over any time frame of your choosing. Using that oracle, you could time the market and profit whenever you needed to.
**I'm not claiming to have such an oracle.**
When we fail to find an oracle, we often resort to heuristics. A simple, greedy solution to the problem of investing is dollar cost averaging. You buy on regular intervals, early and often. You hold for years, essentially guaranteeing the maxim "buy low" and "sell high". It works because, on average, the stock market grows at 8% per year.
My method improves upon dollar cost averaging by using a mini-oracle. It fails in two major areas: 1) I can't predict if the next opportunity will be a buy or a sell and 2) I can't predict what the next trading price will be. By giving up those freedoms, I have good confidence that an inflection point in the price has been reached.
It isn't timing the market, but rather just identifying what the market is doing right now. I could indicate a buy and then have the price plunge the next day. I'm OK with that.
I hedge every trade with a limit on how much I buy or sell. Over time I collect profit from the volatility in the price.

I think Bitcoin is fundamentally different from prior tech-based innovations. If crypto-currency succeeds, I have a high degree of confidence it will be Bitcoin.
* The value proposition for Bitcoin is a strange loop - the more people who join, the stronger it gets.
* Early adopters have a vested interest in growing the value.
* Bitcoin can change and adapt to market conditions.
When the web was growing, we switched browsers whenever a better one came along. We kept using TCP/IP and HTTP, however. I think a similar trend will happen with Bitcoin.
You can't really separate the currency from the protocol, because that's how it is secured. So Coinbase, Bitpay and Changetip may come and go, but Bitcoin will endure.

A reliable holding would be something like a bank certificate of deposit or a US government savings bond. Those have many years of proven returns. The interest rate is usually locked in at the time of purchase.
Bitcoin has done well in the past, but that's no guarantee of continued success. The risk/reward ratio is good though. Tons of risk, tons of potential.

I don't think the attack has been divulged. The attackers compromised a system or systems with access to a hot wallet.
Think of it this way: let's say you store some Bitcoin in wallet software on your PC. You protect it with encryption and a strong password. An attacker can steal your funds by installing a keylogger and waiting for you to unlock your wallet. They can then copy your encrypted wallet and decrypt it using information gained from the keylogger.

Short answer: don't.
Competition and ROI for mining hardware is such that you won't be able to profit from hardware by the time it becomes obsolete.

Vendor adoption is a precursor to user adoption. User adoption is strongly correlated with the price.
News of more vendors accepting Bitcoin is great for long-term investors, but it is a signal that the price may drop in the near term.
The exception, of course, is when _the spike_ happens. See: 
In 2005, Facebook had 6m users. It was gaining steam, but was clearly fringe. Back then, MySpace had 22m users (4x their size!). Fast forward 10 years and Facebook has 1.3 _billion_ users.

I use a strategy that lowers my risk from holding long-term. Over time I improve my position while lowering my risk profile. I've been doing this since 2015.
1. Hold a minimum reserve. This ensures that you don't "miss out" on a major price increase.
2. Trade near critical points (see: Calculus) in the average. This improves your odds of picking a good time to buy or sell. Look at broader trends over weeks or months - not days.
3. Offload profits (or losses) into other asset classes. This diversifies your holdings.
A contrived example is given below. The number on the left is the total account balance in USD. The description explains why the value changed.
Assume: the trade fee for stock buy/sell events is $7.50 plus 3 days of lag. Free trades for BTC with 3 days of lag (Circle or similar).
* $800: Buy 1 BTC @ $800 in 2013
* $390: Sell 1 BTC Feb 4 @ $390
* $382.50: Buy 14 NVDA Feb 12 @ $25.73
* $605.44: Sell 14 NVDA May 16 @ $42.19
* $605.44: Buy 1.343 BTC May 25 @ $450.78
* $933.45: Sell 1.343 BTC June 13 @ $695.00
* $896.34: After 25% tax on net profits
Here you can see the importance of "modulating" your investments. If you just hold long-term, you'll miss out on profit potential. The example above ends up with a +29% swing in account value, despite selling BTC at a $410 loss in February.
The long-term holder doesn't claim anything on his/her taxes, but only has $695 at the end - down $105. The trader is up $96.34 after taxes are taken into account.

The pool of words is chosen such that you have 128 bits of entropy. That's all that matters.
You're arguing for being able to specify about 140 bits of entropy - which is overkill.

The growth in processing power should actually help improve stability. As you've pointed out, we've quickly saturated to the point where consumer hardware is reaching the point of no return.
You want miners to be hungry; it means that they'll compete fiercely for every advantage. The probability of a rogue agent introducing a 51% pool goes down with every petahash/sec that is added to the network.
Here are two very important numbers:
1. The 51% attack cost is 1.5 billion USD.
2. The total value of Bitcoin is 9 billion USD.
That means that an attacker will have to spend 16% of the entire value in an attempt to fork the blockchain. They would have much better luck making money by pushing huge sums of money into buy and sell orders.
Now, imagine if the network were running at 1% of the hash rate that it is today. Then a 51% attack would only cost 15 million USD (about 0.2% the value of bitcoin).

Out of what context? Rolling back transactions to avoid double-spend attacks is going to be very expensive and detrimental to adoption.
Transactions can't simply be canceled several times a day without causing major issues with trust and usability.

It's more an exercise in scarcity than outright salivation. The price floor is actually quite reasonable for 7m users ($680/BTC).

   * Electricity consumption is estimated based on power consumption of 650 Watts per gigahash and electricity price of 15 cent per kilowatt hour. In reality some miners will be more or less efficient.
That estimate doesn't appear to have been updated for ASIC hardware. It is off by a factor of 150-650. A BFL Jalapeno nets 5 GH/s for 30 watts.

Recurring payments wouldn't be so bad - the vendor would simply need to supply you with an address to make payments to. It would then be your responsibility to schedule payments. At worst you'd need a way to gather statements. Mint.com already does that.

A bit is simply defined as a storage element that can have two values. The fact that it is the smallest unit in a byte is derived from that.
It is also the smallest unit in a "word" (a grouping of 16 bits).

Micro transactions are, by definition, small amounts of money. You can easily trust any number of companies to supply the market need quite well. There's no need to bloat the blockchain with low value transactions.

This is simply not true: 25 BTC is created every 9-10 minutes regardless of processing power. That's just how it works. The block reward will go down over time as well (replaced long-term by transaction fees).

I've been using Coinbase for a few weeks now with no issues. They tend to buffer prices, which can be both good and bad. Also they sell out of BTC periodically.
One word of caution: your first purchase must clear before you can submit more buy orders. After that you aren't limited except by the daily limit and availability.

Basically you can earn a fair share of the total. So a 50 GH/s piece of hardware can earn a fair fraction of a pool's fraction of 25 BTC every 10 minutes. A few weeks ago 7 GH/s would net you 0.0065 BTC per day. It is probably somewhat lower than that now.

With all the news hitting regarding Bitcoin this is their best chance to capitalize on sub-TH/s hardware. BFL has a history of over-promising and under-delivering. I pre-ordered two Jalapenos on 4/28/2013 and they didn't ship until 11/6/2013 - despite being advised that they would ship in "late July or August".  Maybe they'll celebrate "Christmas" in July!
Shameless plug for my auction: 
They might not ship by Christmas, but I definitely will! Only 1 at this price! ;)

I think this is just a prime example of how supply and demand works. ASIC hardware is very hard to obtain. I pre-ordered BFL hardware in April 2013 and it didn't arrive until about 3 weeks ago.

Blocks won't be generated any faster, but the number of transactions per block *is* configurable.
This will help aggregate tps, but individual transactions won't be confirmed any faster without adjusting the 10-minute block creation rate.
See this discussion of scalability limits:

Transaction fees will consume a higher percentage of mining revenue as time goes on.
That is the content of the block that you seek. There's no reason to create incentives for free transactions.

Yes, a separate blockchain for credit wouldn't compete with bitcoin. It would just reduce cost and improve visibility for our existing credit mess.

Blockchain growth won't be linear forever. It will grow as transaction volume goes up.
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:54:23
That's just the heating and cooling costs and likely isn't terribly accurate. Also, the hash rate is ahead of potential transaction volume by a lot. That's good, because we need price stability.

Depending upon how much BTC you hold, it might be more prudent to remember 3 10-character passwords and split funds across multiple wallets on different devices.
Was it 30 fully randomized characters?
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:39:50
For sums above $300,000 I would tend to agree. But 12 would be just fine for those.
Bitcoin Qt uses SHA-512 for wallet encryption key derivation, which is not efficient on GPUs at the moment.

You have to link each address separately. Nothing ties addresses together beyond transactions. You can easily simulate a third party that you paid for "goods", which is in fact under your control.
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:00:01
The choice to publish your identity is up to you. Also addresses are randomly generated for every transaction typically. So you can tell that I sent $500 *somewhere*, but you may not be able to tell to whom.
But there's plenty of meta data tracking available, so your concern is valid to the extent that you can link addresses to identities.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:23:02
My crystal ball says anywhere from $20,000 to $8,000,000 by 2017. The primary factor seems to be the number of people interested in holding some amount of mBTC.

By that logic you could argue that the network doesn't need much processing power at all. (Every attack results in a crash negating the 'investment').
But that would mean that the network would become very susceptible to collapse. So it is in the mining pools' best interests to improve rapidly while also remaining honest.

The argument is good for a stabilized market, which bitcoin is not. Right now a Cointerra device runs $6000 and probably 1500w for 2000 GH/s. That works out to $1300 a year on energy. Even if miners put 90% toward mining they'll only be able to spend 18% on energy in 2014 (1300/7300 = 0.178).
Regardless of rational behavior (or not), it simply isn't possible to spend 90% on energy because the hardware isn't free.
Over the next few years, miners will be able to allocate more of their budget to power and less to purchasing new hardware. Moore's Law should drive the ratio to about 97% (up from 18% today) by 2020.
World energy usage in 1990 was only 102 PWh (see:  Just 18 years later it was 143 PWh. Is it so far-fetched to think that the bitcoin network could draw 30 PWh a year?
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:01:10

Bitcoins will never be represented using floating-point numbers (lack of accuracy). Fixed-point integers are appropriate.

I've had similar discussions with my wife.
She expressed essentially the same concerns you've listed above: despite the promise of real ownership, bitcoins themselves aren't "real".
There are many hurdles to cross before bitcoin sees mass adoption (if ever). Probably the best improvement right now would be a stored value card that can't be hacked online.
Bitcoin offers much better potential security than any other currency to date, but that doesn't matter if the services that allow you to use it are susceptible to being hacked.
