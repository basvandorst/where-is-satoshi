I am not aware I'm infected with Malware.  What instructions are you talking about?  If you're referring to XDA commenter he/she is correct and not wrong for telling me to debloat.

I betcha that burn address has a key where someone will one day move it, how do we know 100% fact the key is unknown to Xcp founders? The world of Cryptocurrency is filled with ICOs that are shady

They do it to promote their XCP currency I believe.  For each Bitcoins people burned, they got XCP in returned I believe.  No known private key exists for that address, so it is effectively a burn address.

there is your problem, never ever use a downloaded app from App store or even internet as a wallet.  Just never do.  You  need to do cold hardware wallet storage.

Apparently it isn't the only burn address.  There are others that have vanity addresses 1bitcoinonewayaddressdonotsendifyoudon'twanttolose etc etc

They just freshly dumped on everyone.  There was no Gold Karrots or Kakarots from DBZ with Gold hair backing it up.  It was a Scam and dumped to pull in money for CEO and his colleagues

You lost near $12K, sorry to say but someone compromised your keys.  Malware most likely.
