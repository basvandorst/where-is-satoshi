fair point, and knowing his style, that is probably a large part of why he hasn't invested in it. That said, he could buy all of the currently open sell orders on gdax and it would be less than .25% of his net worth.

No, he is giving you an option that will save you money. The fee is an incentive for minders to include your transaction in the blockchain. GDAX is nice enough to cover that cost for you when you transfer out.

You can kind of do both. If the FOMO is hitting you hard, you can buy on Coinbase and transfer over to GDAX once it is posted into your account. Obviously not a good strategy for people who are trading more frequently than once a week.

We all know that Ajit Pai either has shit for brains or is a bought-and-paid-for corporate shill that is a waste of human flesh and doesn't deserve to breathe the same air that we do.
Now, while what he says publicly may make him sound like he's a moron, he's clearly smart enough to climb the ranks at Verizon and become the FCC Chairman, which leads to the conclusion of him being a morally corrupt corporate shill that serves to support himself and his corporate masters.
Now, why would he say something like that? Because he knows that most people are ignorant to how the internet and technology works (which is, in part why he can get away with say stuff like this) and his corporate (and now government!) masters don't like the idea of disruptive, free, open, transparent technologies.

Yes, I didn't intend to suggest that it was something new, and they often appear organically because of psychological barriers.
The sheer volume of orders and the fact that it seems unlikely to be organic makes me think that *something* is going on. What it is? Who knows. It doesn't worry me, I cashed out my initial purchase long ago, so anything above 0 is gravy for me, but it is fun to speculate.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:14
That's a good strategy, you just have to feel good about solvency of the currency to do that. You don't want to buy at a local low only to have it sink more and be left holding the bag.

Agreed, I got out of my main positions in BTC at 18,800 on the 16th and unloaded LTC at $346 a couple days ago when things started to look funny for BTC. I'm still holding my ETH, and waiting for things to look a little bit more stable (as if that is a thing) to buy back in.

Think about what "willing to" means. You don't want to invest money that would go to pay your mortgage, your bills, put food on the table, or even contribute to a retirement account. If you're putting money into bitcoin instead of another hobby or even putting money into a savings account, you still don't want to lose it, but having that money disappear won't change your overall lifestyle or put you at risk for being homeless. That is what i take from the advice "only invest what you're willing to lose."

I'm a watch guy, so I'm buying a watch. This is one that I've looked at for years, sort of a grail watch. I managed to snag one in steel, so the price isn't too exorbitant in this grade of watches. It also is more true to the heritage of the watch, in my opinion.
To answer your question: for me it is. It is hard to say for you, but I think its a beauty.

Ford actually put their own IP on the block as collateral instead of taking the bailout. They knew that it was do or die and took it seriously. I'm not a fan of Ford for a variety of reasons, but I do respect the way they got themselves out of the financial collapse compared to GM and Chrysler.

A limit sets the limit at which you're willing to buy or sell - the lowest you will sell and the highest you will buy.
A stop order intends limits your exposure. It stops what you're currently doing and reverses course. So you would set a stop order to sell a dropping asset or buy a raising asset.

No one can say with 100% certainty, but it should go through. One thing to keep in mind with stop orders is that it will be converted to a market order once the trigger is met. If there are other people with the same stop trigger, that could inadvertently drive the price down, something I suspect may have happened today i.e. a lot of people had stop orders to sell at $10,000, this resulted in a glut which drove prices down temporarily before recovering. You should probably think about a limit order to help mitigate this.

I'm going to stop you right there. If $700 is truly all you have to your name, you have no business buying bitcoin at all. Cryptocurrencies are still in very nascent stages, and because of that they are inherently risky.
I doubt you will find any qualified fiduciary who will advise you to invest your entire net worth of $700 into anything but an AAA government bond or a CD much less an unstable cryptocurrency (and keep in mind there are a lot of less risky options between an AAA bond and bitcoin).
This is not intended to be financial advice, but I would suggest you think very hard about whether this money is something you can afford to lose before you buy any cryptocurrency.

It would have to come out of the entity at some point at which point it would be taxable income. You're better off hodling for 1 year to get to long term capital gains.

I'm not sure, but I think the proprietorship would need to pay taxes on the gains (it would be considered income of the entity).
