Don’t use shapeshift unless you are okay with the hidden exchange fees. I’ll admit they are convenient, but for the most bang for your alt, use an exchange like Bittrex or Binance.

Depends what your end goal is. If you’re in it to make more USD, then it really doesn’t matter. If you’re in it to make more BTC, then you want to find an alt that constantly (read: constantly, not pump once and never again) outperforms the USD in terms of growth, like XMR. 95% of the time you’re better off just holding BTC.

Ledger doesn’t have a tamper proof seal nor does it require one because every time it connects to your computer it first verifies that the device has not been internally tampered with and that it is a genuine Ledger

Exchanges that deal only in crypto are typically a bit cheaper than exchanges that allow you to exchange your fiat money. Same idea as paying $2.49 for a 20oz soda at a gas station versus $1.19 at the grocery store. Convenience.

Bitcoin cash’s main selling points are undoubtedly the lower fees and quicker transactions, which sure, is a nice thing. Who wouldn’t like paying less fees and waiting less time for confirmations? Maybe it was how satoshi envisioned it, or whatever you wanna say about that, I won’t get into that, but take a step back and look at the bigger picture. 
From my very limited inexperience with cryptos, I’ve discovered that although it seems like the days of cryptos are here, especially with all the news coverage it’s getting... it’s not. It’s nowhere near actually. We are so far away from mainstream adoption that it hurts me inside thinking about it. Sometimes when I need a good laugh, I’ll open Facebook and find anything bitcoin related and read the comments people post. They are absolutely clueless. 
Bitcoin cash does not bring anything entirely new to the crypto game. It takes Bitcoin’s current weaknesses and attempts to fix them for a right here right now solution. That’s fine. Let them. But sometimes it’s not about releasing first in this space, it’s about releasing better. Bitcoin has some growing and developmenting to do as well. It’s like we’re at an American football game, where the Broncos are up 21-7 against the Raiders at halftime. Sure, the Raiders have great football players too, but the Broncos aren’t just going to let their guard down the second half of the game...do you get what I’m saying?
All of us here honestly are so damn early to the game, so early that the stage and lights have not even been delivered to the arena yet. Everyone over at r/btc pretend like the concert began an hour ago.

Just keep buying. 10.8, 9k, 14k, whatever, buy it all.

I think it’ll drive up LTC sales, not BTC.
Coinbase is  in the App Store’s Top Free as of now. They’ll download Coinbase, half will stop right there and not even create an account, the other half will and see that BTC is too much, and rather invest some in LTC cause it’s cheap, in hopes of it will moon like BTC

100% agreed. Many trading indicators are showing us warning sell signals. Not only are we reaching incredible resistance levels, plus greed indicators are only getting higher, the fake volumes plus inorganic weekend activity... take a look at the all time entire crypto market cap chart... a storm is brewing. Be prepared and level headed

Anything related to pro-banking is downvoted to hell here, but I agree with you. Sure banks are evil and all, but at the end of the day, they are still an integral part, even in the crypto community (for now at least- no fiat coming into crypto spaces on weekends). 
I helped my best friend who is a car salesman set up his bank account a few months ago and he deals with &gt;10k deposits and withdrawals all the time. It’s a matter of having a good relationship with the bank.. it’s reality right now

A couple days ago I watched a youtube video of a guy trading on mt gox back in 2011 and he live streamed it crashing from $15.00 all the way down to $00.01. Sentiment was "no way we'll go below $10" but BTC did not give a fuck, same in 2013 when "it can't go below $250" and it fucked us all at $160. We have to remember BTC doesn't follow suit... now we're saying "no possible way it'll go below 3k" ... I know history doesnt repeat itself.. but it does rhyme
