I’m guessing that’s the developer’s distribution profile name - the same developer must’ve done the Binance app and just uploaded it to the App Store using his own Distribution profile rather than create a new one for Binance. Which is weird and stupid.

Every day is the best time to buy. Dollar cost average ftw. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:28:40
I just assume every low is the floor and every high is the ATH. You can read the charts until you’re blue but you just never know with crypto, too many variables to consider. All I can do and which has served me well is to buy a little often to benefit from dollar cost average, buy a bit more on the dips, hold, rinse, repeat.

The variation in price is because after the fork BTC and BCH share a transaction history but they are on their own Blockchain which means they have different trading volumes (buyers and sellers/supply and demand), different numbers of miners, different mining difficulty with different mining fees and mine profitability. All of these factors combined (technology and economics) influence the difference in price. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:30:11
Futures are basically betting on a future price of a commodity. The seller is betting the price will go down, buyer is betting the price will go up. Either way, both buyer and seller are on the hook to either gain or lose a little or a lot. There’s a law (Commodity Exchange Act) against manipulation of a nationally traded commodity, which also applies to digital currencies. But, behind the scenes shady manipulation is improbable but not impossible.

A guy on here rigged a shit ton of GPUs he had lying around in a server room to a shit ton of solar powered generators. I can’t remember if he’s profitable though. As many have said, it’s cheaper and easier to mine alt coins, then use it to buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:16:05
Don’t buy because evidently you don’t truly understand Bitcoin. When you understand it, you will see no reason not to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:04:14
This is the important part for me:
“However, unlike critics who have dismissed the digital currency as a speculative bubble, Novogratz *wasn’t using his bubble comment as a negative connotation*. In October, during an interview, Novogratz said:
Historically, manias or bubbles happen around things that fundamentally change the way we live. If it’s the railroad bubble or the Internet bubble, it really changed the way we live. 
He added that in 10 to 15 years the blockchain and decentralised systems would be in use everywhere, claiming that this bubble is ‘going to be the great manias of all time.”
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:19:03
This is an excellent thesis/antithesis. The point on Bitcoin not being backed by anything is something that’s iffy for many. Many people see Bitcoin (and the Blockchain) as the “backing” rather than it being backed by anything (or backed by nothing). They don’t see it as fiat, they see it as digital gold, where its finiteness/scarcity drives demand, supply  and how it is valued, hence its value.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:48:12
Yeah this hit home the day I saw a contestant from The Bachelor shilling Bitcoin on Twitter.

For me there isn’t one specific reason, you have to look at all the factors and effects at play including FUD as a result of the Coinbase debacle, issues with some exchanges, FUD over the  South Korean government announcements, Indian government, Christmas Time debt, Weak Hands, constant media FUD, tax considerations, people on vacation etc etc.

Yes. Gemini or cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:04:45
Nope because as long as mining remains profitable and demand is high and continues to grow, it can only go up. The question is not if but when.

Google Satoshi Roundtable and Coinbase, the CB CEO wrote a detailed though biased blurb about what caused this current split. It gives you some background. The conspiracy/speculation boils down to scaling, deep pocket forking and some noisy links between the main head of Bilderberg and Blockstream investors.

I once believed in Windows and anti-every software ever until I woke up one day and my PC’s default language and all my ebay info was changed to Mandarin and I was receiving threatening emails from eBay “customers” I’d apparently sold hundreds of dollars worth of gaming mice to in the space of a day. I scrapped the PC and got a Mac + web wallet + torturous emails to eBay to restore my account and never looked back. YMMV.

Back in March when I bought my biggest lot, the price seemed so high and I felt like crap regretting not buying sooner and would never have believed I’d see $8000 this soon.

I imagine the effect would be the same as a pump and dump. Where with a pump dump  it involves a group hyping a stock they own in order to get Joe Public to put money into it thus driving the price up and then selling at the top before others get a chance to get out which then drives the price down. If it’s a worthless penny stock or whatever, then Joe loses and the rich group wins and the stock is dead. A good thing BTC isn’t a worthless stock and isn’t dependent on just one rich group keeping coin. With all the advancements, resilience and signs of adoption by some big retail players in the international market, the long term outlook is great.
