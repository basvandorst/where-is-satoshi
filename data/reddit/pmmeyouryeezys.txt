I see what you mean. I just wish hodl didn't imply not spending. Although we probably have the high fees to blame for that.
Also keeping money in your bank account IS a waste of money. Do you think Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos put their money in their bank account and just leave it?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:46:07
It's like opening a fast food restaurant and calling it burger Prince
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:47:09
This, many people need to get rid of the mindset that keeping dollars in the bank is the standard thing to do. It's almost the same as spending all your money on a stock that has consistently been decreasing in value throughout history.

Isn't lightning basically just an altcoin if it's not on the main chain?
@_date: 2018-01-26 01:28:58
Who differentiates between a core position and liquid bitcoin? Obviously thats what would happen in a perfect world though.
Well you always need to calculate opportunity costs, and just leaving it doesn't do anything for you.

So far there's only been a handful of days in the entire history of bitcoin on which it was a bad idea to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:25:20
Anyone else just buy btc for the thrill? 
Will it go up? Will it go down?
Nobody knows!

Btc has viruses on its Blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:13:44
People already are using it, but for the wrong reasons. 
I see your point though.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:53:09
Might not be a wrong reason to use it but there definitely is a right one.
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:29:10
Yeah, but this is pretty much a global problem bitcoin has. 
I blame it on the "hodl" people. 
Bitcoin isn't gonna grow if no one actually uses it or even understands the ideology that made bitcoin relevant in the first place.

@_date: 2018-08-26 13:44:58
The reason there's such a discrepancy is due to inflation though

Could argue that eating a steak isn't more than entertainment either

He sounds like an even more generic G Eazy, which I didn't think was possible.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:37:14
Exactly! There is so much other delicious food out there you can eat without supporting the meat industry.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:29:12
I see what you mean, but the main reason people eat meat is definitely for the taste and not because they want to have a healthy diet. If health were of importance people wouldn't eat nearly as much meat as today.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:57:08
Which probably produces 99% of all meat. Only ethical ones I can think of are from hunters or maybe smaller farmers.
@_date: 2019-06-12 19:39:24
If you haven't had it, then you just don't get it yet
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:31:22
I totally understand what you're saying, but it's effectively irrelevant how healthy/unhealthy it is to eat meat if so many people don't care about their diet and will live unhealthy lives regardless of whether they eat meat or not.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:41:29
The nutrients in meat can be found from many different sources, the reason one chooses the steak is for the enjoyment/entertainment of eating it. Let's face it, meat can taste pretty damn good and is easily the nr1 reason people choose to eat it, I don't think that can be argued. 
I never said anything about whether or not eating meat is bad, people need to decide for themselves if eating meat just for the enjoyment of it is unethical or not. I will say however that sourcing meat by conventional means that support the meat industry is without doubt unethical.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:16:42
Unpopular opinion: we should have kept btc as it was after Satoshi and if anyone has a different idea for how a cryptocurrency should work, they should make their own altcoin.

@_date: 2018-03-18 22:21:14
Exactly, very different situation right now. Bitcoins volatility has just gotten more and more extreme, I doubt we'll have to wait long for another spike. What happens after that however is impossible to say.

Inflation sucks though, would not recommend keeping a lot of fiat.

As are literally all investments
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:07:00
Unfortunately not!
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:09:15
Price is related to transaction speed only when a lot of transactions are happening. At the moment that isn't the case so you can get away with small fees and still have fast confirmations. Problem is that many wallets auto select an unnecessarily high fee.
