It isn't a DDoS attack, TOR doesn't use UDP protocol...

So the long story short is...TW can no longer take our money and exchange it for EUR and forward it on to Bitstamp/instant...
but if we want to make a direct SEPA transfer using our banks online service; we can do that but pay our bank £15 for the privellage and get a sh*tty exchange rate? 
Sounds fair to me..

I just find it irritating at this point; in the UK it's ridiculously hard to get bit coins at a good rate, compared with our counterparts across the pond who are lapping them up with ease. 
It leaves a bad taste in my mouth, when I see (smart individuals like yourself) selling to poor bastards with no alternative at a markup on bitlocal and bitbargin.
PS - NO hard feelings :)

Not to my knowledge it can't, yes you can go via a SOCKS but regardless TOR doesn't suppose UDP over SOCKs.
Re. to the type of attack, it's not your usual DDoS..it's more likely to be a flaw in the PHP code being exploited; seen as SR is running on outdated versions PHP4

0 fees? are you mad...
10-20% markup in BTC value/purchase price, and then the cheeky c**ts want a blockchain transaction fee the minute you try to transfer the bloody funds anywhere.

Personally, I've speculated for 2 months..price went too high to buy in. 
Since this shit storm has happened, I've now got £1k sat waiting to buy when things re-open, with a view to them going up over the next couple of months....hopefully xD

Ahhhh I get it, your one of those cocks that buys and sells coins; simply to pump &amp; dump for to make a quick buck!
I'm actually talking about buying coins in a quick manner, unrestricted by UK legislation so I can purchase goods using BTC.

Can someone ellaborate as to wtf is going on atm?
On sunday I transferred £200 into EUR with transferwise via my debit card, into their Barclays account - this was then transferred to the Slovenia account of Bitstamp, on Tuesday morning I had the money in my account. Much faster than expected and I was looking forward to doing the same again.
Now I'm under the impression TW can no longer transfer money TO bitstamp? Or has their UK account been shut down...I'm confused because if they have an account still, who the F*** are the bank to dictate who they send my funds to?
