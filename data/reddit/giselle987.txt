Packet switching != the internet. Mail was around long before anything resembling the internet on small private networks... I guess my only point it is, it wasn't an app but rather an essential networking feature that helped spur the internet's creation. idk, it was all images back then but I'm sure that porn helped drive usenet subscriptions. commercial porn was on the WWW pretty early. we can distinguish the www from the internet from networking technologies

I'm sure there was some intrepid guy making ASCII porn on usenet back in the day. Sex will always find a way (that's why trying to eradicate sex work is so short-sighted and harmful)


Mail was around long before the TCP/IP stack. I guess this depends on how we're going to define the internet...

If there are no other options, I think it's more likely that people will jump ship to other regional sites, use more decentralized forms of advertising, or at the lower end will hit the streets. A lot of the people on backpage don't have many resources at their disposal. And with all the anti-trafficking hysteria, there's a feeling that the state won't stop at targeting payment providers. If you hadn't noticed, we just passed a law that targets advertisers with some pretty severe penalties. I'm afraid that with all this pressure, a lot of people will be making some tough compromises and putting their safety at risk. Dark times...
