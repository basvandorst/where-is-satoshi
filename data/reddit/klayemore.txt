I did the opposite, hoping to make some gains in alts then move back into BTC. Just my luck...

Do NOT gamble your whole investment, only a small portion. Even then, it's a big risk.

Love it. Nice work mate.

Don't be greedy, you had it last.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:28:33
Thoughts? This seems like it could be a huge deal for the opposing team.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:18:43
I'm not. Using BTCmarkets.

Hey, at least I'm being honest. Care to lend your thoughts on a potential dip once 17k is reached?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:01:17
Trying to buy the dip and my exchange in Australia isn't accepting any more deposits until after the Christmas period......

Looks like it will peak at 17, then the wall of sales in the order book will take it down. No idea how much though, so if you decide to gamble, only use a small portion. [Edit: I'm getting this data from GDAX]
P.S. I'm new at this.

So when does BCH trading actually start on Coinbase? Is there a time, or is will it be left until they investigate the insider trading more thoroughly?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:09:24
Sell then buy? That 17k wall looks like it might crash it pretty hard.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:48:44
None. Should have sold the neighbour's kids too.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:27:38
BTCmarkets is the best exchange for Australians.
@_date: 2018-02-22 01:55:55
No, you need to sell lower.

Please help. There was a post shared here from back in 2014 or so, where a guy wrote a fictional story about waking up to 18k BTC in February. Anyone got the link? Cheers.

Plenty of buy support at 8900 on Gdax right now.

Hey guys, I've been travelling for 6 months. Wow BTC is doing great. Any news?

What if McAfee is manipulating the price down, because he REALLY wants to eat his own dick?...
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:56:21
Legend. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:44:32
It was just a joke mate. Grow down.
