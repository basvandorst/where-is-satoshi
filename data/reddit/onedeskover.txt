There are so many problems with this I don't even know where to start.
1.) Inflation isn't a "big problem" if it is reasonable and predictable.  You can easily invest to keep pace with it.
2.) I am pretty sure you were just making a bad analogy, but to be clear, gold does not rust.
3.) Your oversimplify inflation to the point of absurdity.  Yes a 2000 dollar is worth less than a 2010 dollar with inflation, but things have happened between 2000 and 2010.  Prices of things have changed (with many things getting cheaper thanks to better production methods) and your wages or productivity has increased because you now have better capital and/or more skills meaning you have to work less or get paid more than you did in 2000.
4.) Storing value (as the OP called it) is not exactly the same as "remembering work" as you put.  There are plenty of ways for me to make money without doing work.  For example I earn 10$ from working an hour, then buy a stock with it and sit on my couch for 10 years.  I sell the stock and get 20$ back.  I did no work in those 10$ years, yet made money.
5.) The biggest problem with your entire argument is that it in know way leads one to endorse bit coin.  How does bit coin solve any of the problems you address?  Let me put it this way, the point of a currency as you and OP put it is to "store value".  You seem pretty offended that inflation seems to "forget" 20% of the work you did to get that money.  Lets say you are paid in bit coins and the value deflated by 20%.  Why is it ok that the market "remembered" 20% of work that you never did?
6.) The final point I'll make is that almost all of the work on deflation that you citied is looking at reasonable levels of deflation (a few percent).  Bit coin has increased in value 10000% in the past few years.  It's completely unjustifiable to expect the economy to perform the same with such different levels of deflation.
