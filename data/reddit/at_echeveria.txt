What explorer? I control the hashrate with 0.17. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:20:56
Better. 0.16 nodes have to be restarted to continue operating, so the network is now only fixed nodes functioning. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:19:20
The transaction is simply invalid now.
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:20:14
I suspect that there's a greater chance of loss from, as you point out, people like [blockchain.info]( not doing any sort of validation but displaying it as canonical. It confuses people even in this thread that the transaction doesn't exist now, but does show on their website. In this case 0.16 nodes now can't continue their own chain without being restarted, by some happy coincidence of them being unable to reorganise their invalid UTXO.
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:12:12
I've removed the invalid transactions from the chain. Business as normal again.

1 year timeout. If the service goes down, your money is lost for 365 days until you can recover it.

Making a transaction.

It depends on your IP address. Hosts in areas with a lot of nodes will get less connections inbound. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 13:36:46
Pruned nodes don’t differ in block propagation latency.

It is unintended. It is supposed to just return the submission rejection directly from Bitcoin Core to the electrum client (ie, rejected due to dust, low fee, double spend). It is a mistake that this contains HTML rendering, and arguably a mistake that it doesn't hard code possible responses (rather, showing text to the client directly). This is removed in later versions of electrum, but many people aren't using those currently.
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:38:13
Yes. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:57:46
Right. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:41:59
It’s stickied by the subreddit moderators and created by one of the IRC channel operators. It contains only text and two images. I considered putting it on its own domain, but why is that more trustworthy than using the hosts shared one? 
Here’s a screenshot.

Unfortunately one of the later phishing messages resembles the "white hat phishing" a lot more, which makes explaining this to end users even harder. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 02:49:34
I added a screenshot. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 05:16:26
The error intended to be passed is directly from the bitcoin core node that the electrum server is connected to. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:50:58
Nope. Analyzing malware to see what addresses are hard coded into it does not mean that I have stolen any money, or have had access to stealing money, or that I’m distributing malware. I downloaded it and analyzed the binaries from a phishing site just like I’m warning people not to here. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 15:50:52
This is an account explicitly to post this comment. The history is entirely commenting “cute” on videos of cats for a week, and then suddenly decides this is the first and best time to call the warning a fake. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 07:54:50
That’s not charitable. This is the first instance of this sort of bug in Electrum, and the developers of it have put in enormous effort to stop it from being exploited. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 11:33:06
Closer to $2M now than not, with an extra $80,000 or so in the last day or two. One user seems to have lost $100,000 from their wallet. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 14:21:06
I too, knew this was possible (I wrote a partly compatible server at one point) and it never occurred to me.
@_date: 2019-02-07 11:15:00
This malware seems to be fairly well written, surprisingly so actually. The execution of the phishing site isn't particularly well done. From the public records available it appears that the author has a prior history of running other Ethereum based scams and theft operations, based on similar domain names that I was able to find using Security Trails, a service which maintains a history of most domain names and hosting information.
@_date: 2019-02-10 02:50:46
More than 1.5M USD over 3 known variants now. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 09:42:29
All versions in distributions at the moment will see the malicious message. Just don’t ever install the malicious binaries. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 08:30:32
Over $3 million USD now. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 01:55:24
It’s not intended to work like this, it’s meant to be a plain text error messages directly from the remote Bitcoin Core daemon, and certainly not supposed to be rendered as HTML. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 04:53:29
Based on the samples of the malware I have been able to obtain, a total of 138.71578375 BTC or $468027 has been stolen so far over at least 150 instances of people downloading and executing the malicious binaries.
@_date: 2019-04-23 08:13:17
There’s no standard for this.
@_date: 2019-02-07 11:16:29
This is correct. An oversight in the way that the Electrum client displays errors to the client causes error messages to be rendered in HTML, which allows for the attacker to make legitimate looking upgrade notices within the client. It is a surprising thing for most people as it appears to be coming from the client itself, which they're already trusting to store their money. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 13:39:16
Your response doesn’t make sense. Do you think there’s not automated release testing of bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:16:59
automated tests of what?
