still gotta get the Bitcoin logo added to the "payment methods" at the bottom of the page...THEN it's official

I also bank with Chase...no problems as of yet but respectively a lot smaller volume in both $$ and number of transactions.  I've seen others having problems, including yourself, but generally only with business accounts.  So I'm just curious to confirm that this was a personal account?

Dear Amazon,
Buy Bitcoin.  Announce acceptance of Bitcoin.  Stack paper.

Why does all of this sound so trollish?  


 


Isnt the point of BitPay to convert Bitcoin to another currency?  
@_date: 2016-09-07 03:24:33
Yes, please explain
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:52:34
Pretty much this.  More info on the original case referred to in this article [here](
It sounds like it was pretty much bullshit from the beginning with that guy anyway, and probably crossing the line into entrapment.

This puts a big ole shit eating grin on my face about my purchase late last night

"It's fake money" - says a friend of mine, he keeps repeating that but won't have an actual conversation about it

I think you missed it...

Got it now, my 1st bitcoin tip, thanks again!

Who do you bank with? Some banks take longer than others to process these transactions but are generally consistent with all account holders from a common sender.  It would be nice to hear from people who have cashed out via CB, what bank they use and how long it has taken.

Is this real?  ...and this guy works at a university? He's a fucking moron.  That "negative return" he's looking for...it's called inflation.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:12:28
Trying to draw a correlation between those two charts is dumb...they're not updated regularly and the daily transactions always shows low at the beginning of the day.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:53:38
I found bitcoin very shortly after I joined, and really haven't had much interest in looking at anything else since
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:27:31
Another confirmed
Thx OP! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:57:29
Is that total bitcoin being transacted or count of transactions? 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:53:02
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:22:57
I've used/played with many of them.  I've accumulated a grand total of .00024 BTC from them.  It has been an interesting practice and easy way to gain some BTC to experiment with and learn how transactions work.  Yes, it is a TON of time to accumulate almost nothing, but I think a good learning tool. The transaction fee thing is a non-issue as coinbox accumulates the payouts for you and deposits once you reach a certain threshold.

@_date: 2013-11-21 03:23:06
Does this mean I can request my tax refund in BTC? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:24:38
lots of begging going on...isnt that against the tipping reddiquette?
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:05:10
Very interesting test...def interested in looking at it more closely when I've got a bit more time.
Congrats to the newbies and good luck to y'all!

So...correct me if I'm wrong, but having one of these, with a public QR on the back could allow the holder to accept BTC to a wallet with private keys on a mobile device or computer to verify receipt?  It would just be a novelty way of accepting BTC payment without need to pull out one's phone? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:41:27


...and I thought I liked you up until this
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:23:41
The Coinbase Trader app does this on your mobile

Should probably block out the account/routing numbers before posting on the internet...
