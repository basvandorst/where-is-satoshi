Wouldn't it be possible for 2 pools to work together to get 51%?
Wouldn't it be safer if there was a system that miners had to use to be able to mine. The system would distribute miners to a random pool (miners and pools can still choose the pool fee, reward, etc), but the system would choose the pool. It would also make sure it didn't go above x% hashing power.

People don't like the annoying ads: audio, flashing, etc..
I haven't seen a single annoying ad from Google Adsense. IMO adblock should be disabled by default for adsense ads.
As long as an ad isn't malware, intrusive, or tries too hard to get your attention, I don't see the problem.

It's technically a digital payment system.

You still have to pay your bank to have an account, a card, and extra services. That's all free with bitcoin, but you can also choose to pay the fee.
Edit: Apparently there are banks that doesn't charge any fees.

That's irrelevant. Something you take for granted could be hard for someone else. Not everyone knows what to download. If they figure out what to download they have to install it using a usb-stick or burn it to a cd, and that can be even harder.  This makes it easy for these people. Plus they'd have to buy a usb-stick or a cd burner and cd's. Which means at least $50+

That's a somewhat normal occurrence in these types of situations. They'll probably understand if you tell them how you feel. 
If they ask you for advice, help them. If they ask for money, say you don't have any real money, it's all invested in Bitcoin, and you're not going to remove your investment.

You can always change the CSS style on a currency you never trade.
Like on 
You use the [Stylish]( extension.
with this CSS:
     {
    width: 100%;
    height: 115%;
    position: absolute;
    background: white;
    left: 0;
    top: 0;
    padding: 50px;
    }
    
     {
    width: 90%;
    margin: 0 auto;
    }
    
     {
    display: block;
    width: 500px;
    margin: 25px auto;
    }
    
     {
    margin-left: 61%;
    margin-top: 28px;
    z-index: 2;
    }
It will look like this: 
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:02:35
0.1 &gt; 0.11 &gt; 0.12
 0.2 &gt; 0.21 &gt; 0.22
