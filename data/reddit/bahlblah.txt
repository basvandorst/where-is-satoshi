Have you confirmed its value is $0? Depending on when it was printed or if it came with a special set, it's sometimes worth non $0 amounts. Even if it isn't, someone may be willing to pay you a few cents if they've lost some from their box, or if they like to play with a larger than usual number of people and constantly are running out.

Note that he said "some." Take me for example. This is my second all time post in and I am on the list. My other post was three months ago and is (right now anyway) at positive karma. My only other post on a pro-Bitcoin subreddit was in another "shame the trolls" thread on Other than some posts to I post exclusively on The only reddit conversations I've had with bitcoiners were ones had with folks who wandered into Please explain how I am a troll. Is your issue with folks who come to to snark and troll, or is it with the idea that there are dessenting opinions somewhere on the Internet?
pointed out that some on the list were not trolls, and the jist of your reply seems to be ban them all.
I have generally avoided posting here because I've seen that the echo chamber down votes things they don't like which is a pretty quick way to kill a conversation, but maybe some day (like today) I'll want to come here to ask a question or engage in a conversation to challenge my opinion on a Bitcoin related topic. Should I be banned from here just because I post on I would very much appreciate hearing what I've done to date that makes me a troll.

[Dogecoin folks]( did the work for you on this front actually. I think there were a few other threads on around that time with some additional research as well which could probably be dug up with some more google queries.
