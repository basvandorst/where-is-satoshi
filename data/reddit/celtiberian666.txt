BCH is not even a drop in a ocean when it comes to future threats to BTC.
Just forget about them. The main concern should be to solve scale, fungibility and privacy in the BTC blockchain.
We can't sit on top of our network effect forever. Without meaninfgul upgrades BTC will not win the game. In the long run the better tech will probably triumph.
BCH is nothing, is just a coin trying to win a place under the sun like all others. The main discussion needs to be LN, CTs and other features needed to move foward.
When we care too much about BCH we are just looking to the past. We are looking DOWN to the third coin in size. But we're the first one in size! We can't look down, we need to raise the head and look up TO THE MOON. Otherwise another coin will.

There is inflation. The correct old definition of inflation is not "overall price increases" but higher monetary supply.
And we ARE seeing inflation even if we think inflation = prices. We have the largest worwide asset bubble right now the world have ever seen, most of it in bonds and stocks. Central banks (mainly european and Japan) are buying bonds and stocks like there's no tomorrow. If the flow of new money goes to assets and not consumer goods we'll see the CPI lagging behind asset prices.

They don't "use it in commerce". They released an open source software and thats all.
And even if you were right, the official Core documents clearly calls BCH as Bitcoin Cash (BIP-0044 calling SLIP-0044 list).
Want to apply common law here? Who "used in in commerce"? Everyone. As the creator didn't claimed ownership, it was homesteaded by who "used it in commerce" and that means everyone. An ethereal entity called "bitcoin community" owns the brand, and the share of ownership is proportional to how much each node "use it in commerce" (more relevant nodes owns a larger share of the name). That ownership is unregistered. And if someone want to take its own "share of property over the name" to a different path than the larger consensus blockchain, he is free to do so and to call it "Bitcoin something" - that new chain and fork will only get any traction if the ones forking had before any meaningful contribution and "commerce" on the original chain.
In the event of a fork, two things may happen:
1 - If the majority follows the fork, the "community property rights over the name" also goes with the fork, that means the FORK will now be called with the same name as the original coin. Just like ETH was forked from the immutable longer chain (ETC) because they wanted to roll back transactions. The majority followed the fork and it retained the name. The remaining legacy chain had to rename themselves, but the minority DO NOT lose their share of property over the name, they can use that to call the new chain "Ethereum Something" (they could try to retain the name "Ethereum" but they just didn't because that was impossible, the majority went the other way!).
2 - If the majority stays on chain, the original chain retains the original name, just like Bitcoin is still called Bitcoin! If the majority of "economic relevant nodes" that "use it in commerce" just went with the big block fork, what would happen? The 8mb network would be Bitcoin! And the 1mb chain would need to be called something else (like Core, Legacy or whatever), but that didn't happen. The minority chain forked have the right to call itself Bitcoin Cash because of the support of relevant nodes and people who helped Bitcoin a lot in the early days, so they DO OWN a share of the bitcoin name, and they took that minority share and used in the newly forked coin they support. They have their own individual shares of ownership, but as they don't have the MAJORITY of shares if they tried to call themselves "Bitcoin" and just use "BTC" ticker what would be just REJECTED as a fraud by almost everyone. They didn't just because they couldn't, because the majority "ethereal owners of bitcoin brand" stayed on the 1mb chain, so the minority used a "forked name" just like they have a forked chain!
This is pretty much just like core's argument for consensus: the economic majority decides. Not only on chain, but also about which coin retains the name.
This is the common law and nature rights interpretation to the open source crypto projects. And it is happening just like that. With no need of any type of enforcement.

You can't put the blame on r/btc. The only one to blame is yourself.
You took an emotional decision because you were concerned just about the price and not VALUE. You freaked out to see BTC go down and BCH go up. Never buy or sell anything under high stress.
You need to reconsider the amount of money you have in crypto. Maybe it is too much for you to take. Can you handle a bear market going from $13k to $1k and staying there for 1 year, with Ethereum close to flippening? Be true to yourself. If you can't handle that, diversify your portfolio better (not only in alts but also stocks, real estate, ETFs, REITS and bonds).

Wrong. FOMC dictate the monetary policy, the federal reserve board of governors have majority of votes in the FOMC and its members are appointed by the president. The federal reserve banks are hybrid entities, they are not pure corporations nor pure government agencies, and they just function do implement the monetary policy dictated by the FOMC. The federal reserve system is a banking cartel under the stewardship of the federal government. The hands of the government are all over it.

**The seven members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System are nominated by the President** and confirmed by the Senate.
Thus the FOMC is controlled by the government, and so is the monetary policy and the federal reserve system as a whole.

BCH is not facing a huge risk because of the way it can lower the difficulty faster than BTC. Otherwise it would have not even survived until now.
In the long run the relative hashrate and difficulty of both chains will be a function of its price.
BTC 1mb is now at a higher risk if all the 2x signataries fork and begin to mine 2mb blocks. The 1mb chain will be left with blocks taking more than 1h30m to be created. Core devs are already talking about an emergency HF of the 1mb chain with a difficulty or POW change if that happens, to ensure the survival of BTC+SW+1mb. I don't think +90% hashrate will go to 2x, but you can see in this subreddit core devs openly talking about this emergency plan.

It is even worse. Miners leaving core's for segwit2x would in theory make segwit 2mb the real Bitcoin with longest chain and most proof-of-work (if that is the definition of Bitcoin, of course). The lower difficulty chain (segwit 1mb) would be just an altcoin, I think. Just like BCH, it is not the original Bitcoin because of minority hashrate and lower difficulty, if it had forked with majority hashrate it would be the longest chain with most proof-of-work, and that means Bitcoin.

Gold was money for thousands of years. Gold was deflationary after the industrial revolution because productivity increased faster than the supply of gold. And the economy did well. No problem at all.
Deflation is a GOOD THING to have. Bitcoin is sound money, and that means it is scarce and deflationary. It stimulates saving and investing? Yes it does, and this is the foundation of economic growth. Before any consumption can take place, there have to be production.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:44:39
Of course a block rejected by ALL nodes will be just orphaned - and lets not forget that miners also run nodes. That is clear consensus. And it have happened in the past, it can be due to an error. It is the foundation of BTC to orphan those blocks. Nothing to worry, everyone rejecting a block is clear consensus.
We are not talking about clear-cut cases, where is easy to see if there is or there is not consesus, black-and-white situations. We're talking about gray cases.
What if there are nodes that accepts the 2mb blocks with no other change in the code besides blocksize, togheter with &gt;90% of the miners mining them? It will be the longest chain. It is consensus? It is not? How to measure it? Is it binary or a continuum?
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:44:23


This is FUD. Bitcoin Cash was created to have bigger blocks and no segwit. If this is a good or bad thing, each one should make its own mind. I just hodl both.
Even a BTC maximalist must embrace the existence of BCH as a good thing for 3 reasons:
1- it helps drives big blockers away from BTC.
2 - it helps drive the "evil miners" - packing "whateverboost" or any tech you don't fancy - away from BTC.
3- it serves as a "backup chain", in case anything go wrong with the original BTC we have another already up and running with a large enough hashrate to be secure;
There is no reason for anyone, be it BTC maximalist, BCH maximalist or neutral, to be butthurt about the hard fork that occurred. It went well with no problems and the two chains are now totally separated in two different coins.

There still needs to be economic coordination. What if there are robots doing sapphire mining and houses, but everyone wants sapphires no one wants houses? How to you solve the backlog of sapphires? How can you tell who wants sapphires more? How do you close the house building business and employ more resources in sapphire mining? A cash system with free market prices is the best resource allocation system we have, even in your utopia (in that case of "communism with robots", everyone would just be credited a fixed amount of cryptos and can trade for anything they want, at market prices that will be very low due to high production output).
But I'll buy into your thinking for just a moment. Just like humans "wouldn't need a cryptocoin" if everything suddenly became non-scarce (and thus non-economic goods), the robots can suddenly realize they don't need us.

It is for you if you want to use it like that. If you just leave your BCH where they are, it can work as a snapshot.


Well, do it then. Why not? Good luck having miner, merchant and other supports. That is the main thing: it is a "backup chain" that's secure and usable. Backup in the meaning of something to use in case the main thing goes kaput, NOT in the meaning of equal copy.


Kicked out? Like if asicboost_detection = 1, ban miner, right now? Yes? No? I don't think so. The software was just updated and some mining gimmick won't work anymore. So what? No one was "kicked". The "evil miners" are right now mining both chains, dividing their hashpower. With no BCH they would have just kept mining BTC with 100% of their hashrates and the 2x menance would have been much more dangerous.


Years arguing over something and doing nothing is way more weakening than a hard fork ocurring when 2 groups can't agree on something. If that fork ocurred 2 years ago we would have been in a better state right now.
I agree with you 2x is a threat. BCH wasn't, the fork went well and the chains are well separated. Thats my main point: there is no need to be butthurt about Bitcoin Cash like the OP did, it was just a peaceful event where a piece of the community went their own way. Just that. 2x is much bigger than that, its a fight for Bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:04:44
ViaBTC now have 205 PHash mining Bitcoin Cash. Thats ~3% of entire network, and this means something like 5-6 hours to the first block if only they are mining it. But they're not alone. Yes, it is much likely under 10%, but probably above 3%. It will be something like 4-7 hours (expected time, can be a lot more or a lot less).
The miners mining right now are doing for a loss. Once the difficult goes down it should get more hashrate.

It would be a fork just as BCH is a fork. As I said: that doesn't mean it would be worth anything.
A fork can result in changes to the original chain (if done with majority hashpower) or a new chain with a new token (if done with minority hashpower).
What happened was a hard fork that resulted in a new coin called Bitcoin Cash because BTC retained the majority of hashpower. Just that.

Bitcoin was designed expecting miners to be for-profit. It does not rely on miners being "ideological" in any way.
You can't call "bad actor" someone who is acting as expected.
If bitcoin can't survive some miners switching chains it is not the honey badger any more. But I think it will survive. Don't worry so much.
Miners switching is just a drop of water compared to future attacks BTC may need to defend itself against when it becomes mainstream.
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

As expected. People are dumping Bitcoin Cash to buy Bitcoin. Higher demand for Bitcoin means higher BTC price, and it drags along all other cryptos.
I'm actually suprised BCH is still above $200. I tought the dumping would be harder.
But I recommend to you all to HODL bitcoin cash, or at least part of it (like 50%). We don't know whats gonna happen with the 2x part of the agreement. It is a free hedge ticket, keep it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:43:24
It took time before we could see the miners switching to BCH. It will take time for the switch back.

Indeed. If bitcoin is the chain with the most work the BCH chain can still overtake BTC.

I've read the entire Greg response. P2P network topology is not that hard to grasp.
Doing that still hurts consensus by nodes. The network problems for not doing that would be small (a few hours or days before everything gets back togheter). The network thing seems to me just an excuse to block a fork because they fear to be left in the minority chain.
Not only disconnecting is not a good thing, but the signalling/voting for 2x should have been merged into core, so anyone that wants can signal using core's client and if a certain threshold is achieved then all core clients follow the fork consensus. This is what would be a real trully software team working FOR bitcoin and working in favor of consensus and against forks: let the people decide and follow through. This way there would be NO PROBLEM at all in the network. This way there is much less political drama. This way we're all protected from individual judgements from the devs, the consensus will choose the path, not them. There is no need for a hack like automatically disconnecting nodes that you don't agree with.
The way it is right now is kinda broken. A lot of people (just like myself from years ago until 3-4 months) are not reading the debates. They just assume Core is the "official" team of devs. They would think about a BIP and signal its opinion if its in a new core release to sinal in or out of that proposal. But they'll not change software just to sinal something. So we don't have real consensus, we have core's pushed consensus. They're activelly trying to block any other opinion or any chance of a fork that undermine their power. They're trying to push consensus by core's devs, not real network and users consensus.
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:40:16

@_date: 2017-08-08 12:58:09


BCH can be called "an altcoin" because it forked with much less hashpower than the main chain. It is based on bitcoin but it is not THE bitcoin. A fork with majority of hashpower is not that simple.

I mined with CPU in 2010 for 2 hours. Got no block and got tired of it, never turned the software on again. I could have got 1 block (50 BTC) a day with a quad core at that time. We all did mistakes. Hindsight is 20/20.
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:06:03


This is true in the long run. But it doesn't answer my question. You're saying consesus is measured by price? If it is, the only way to truly measure it is to fork and see what price each chain gets in the long run. Its a big and costly event just to measure consesus. There have to be a faster and more efficient way to do it.

The FED charters don't set monetary policy. The FOMC does. And the Federal Reserve Board of Governors have the majority on the FOMC. And the seven members of the board of governors are appointed by the president. All the current members have political affiliation to one of the USA's political parties. They have long terms, but can be removed by the president.
In a nutshell: people appointed by the government set the policy the FED need to obey in their open market transactions. Oh, they don't do it alone, of course, the other FOMC members represent the banking cartel. In each and every country with an active central bank, it is an alliance of the banking cartel with the government, for mutual benefits. Bitcoin was created as a way out of this monetary tyranny.

@_date: 2017-08-21 22:25:10


In real word economic problems with a lot of agents the equilibrium is never reached because of the knowledge problem (Hayek).
There is a theorical equilibrium of strategies giving maximum profitabillity, but it can only be achieved in a scenario of full knowledge.
In a real scenario the strategies mix will float around the equilibrium. Just like in any real world market.
Another thing: miners don't have to commit to just one coin. Each hash per second is a decision, and the strategy is to decide when (triggers) to change sides and how much hashpower will be changed. Just like some pools are right now split between the coins.
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:44:03
The fork has begun, Bitcoin Cash nodes are rejecting Core blocks.

The whole "consensus by nodes" concept just crumbles to the ground when the client many people still see as "official" are apparently coded to mute what their devs don't want.

@_date: 2017-08-23 02:54:11
So his main point is "nimble bitcoin because of war". He actually made a good point.
Low blocksize bitcoin is not the honey badger. Its a cockroach, not one but an entire population of roaches. You can't kill it even with a nuke. It is more resilient than a honey badger.
In the meantime, before this "war against government" happens, we can use coins that are faster and cheaper. Thats why BCH (and other options) is a good thing. I don't want to eat roaches for breakfast. I want bacon, eggs and cheese, I want big fat pigs and cows (blocks) feeding me delicious things (fast and cheap transactions). If the war comes and all I have are roaches to eat, fine. But we are not there yet, and maybe never will.
BTC with small block + LN is a roach, a cow or both? I don't know. Government can probably take down the largest LN hubs, can't they?
And what if this "war" does not happen? He seems to underestimate the resillience of governments and central banks. They'll do what they must to survive as institutions and retain at least a fraction of their power. Most of the governments and central banks are not naive enough to try to kill the people's preferred way of making payments and storing value. They will just buy criptos to back up fiat, banks will build services and maybe even fractional reserves on top of criptos and business will go on as usual. They may try to kill criptos, but only after a LONG atrition of decades, like they did to the gold standard. We'll have the benefit of a little bit more honest banks and governments, just like we did under the gold standard, but THATS IT! Bitcoin adoption will NOT instantly bring the libertarian utopia - the "ancapistan" - alive. Just because people will have the means to evade the government, this doesn't mean they will! Current society is the product of centuries of brainwashing, around the world, about the nation-state being a good thing. You can't undo centuries of indoctrination it with a clever criptographic coin on the internet. Most of the people nowadays are SHEEP and will happily pay capital gains tax on their bitcoins or store them in fractional-reserve banks. Cryptos WILL become mainstream BEFORE the "taxation is theft" idea is accepted by the majority. 
The main conflict is a war of ideas, not technology. Ideas are more important, techs are just means to an end. Muskets and gold, AR-15s and criptos, it doesn't matter without the right ideas.
And if you happen to live in a country of psychos that WILL wage an all-out declared war against the people's currency of choice, well, its better to stash guns, ammo and supplies, not full nodes. You'll need it.

If a user need to send funds RIGHT NOW using criptocoins, it is in his best interest to use something else. You don't need any troll to tell you that, you just need to do the math.
Here in Brazil and other poor countries people sometimes use BTC to send money overseas, but transaction costs right now make it more expensive than other options, be it crypto or fiat.
Our hopes are on LN to make BTC usable as cash again. Lets hope it works well and helps BTC return to its former glory of fast and inexpensive transactions.

If its going to collapse under its own weight in the future, I don't know. But it will have lower fees for onchain transactions.

@_date: 2017-08-05 14:10:42
You're using the words in the wrong way. Bitcoin Cash is a new coin that hardforked from Bitcoin. A fork is a substantive to name an event in the network, not an adjective to stick to a coin.
A fork did happened and the result was a minority of miners following the forked chain with its token, now called BCH. If you call "altcoin" anything thats not the longest Bitcoin chain with most proof-of-work, then sure it is an altcoin - one that resulted from a hardfork off Bitcoin. Just like Bitcoin Core will be an altcoin if segwit2x forks with majority hashpower.

A big piece of the community just trust core and whatever they do.
A 2mb or 4mb HF supported by core would be like a hot knife through butter.
Core don't want it because they don't want it. They have their own technical arguments and one of them even think 1mb is too large. There is no easy, objective and reliable way to measure if "the community" prefer 1 or 2mb.
This is just a fact: core won't raise it. A fork ocurred because of it. There is no need to argue about it anymore, we just need the core's chosen method to scale to work well, and that means LN up and running.

If they fork with majority hashrate, I guess It will be Bitcoin (longest chain with most proof-of-work?).

One example don't invalidate what I said. Have you modelled miner-node behaviour in different network topologies and scenarios, voting for differerent proposals, and came to the conclusion that the equilibrium is ALWAYS miners following nodes? Please share your research with the community.


I understand that when core devs refuse to allow nodes to merge a BIP and let NODES and not themselves decide what path to follow, they can only be afraid of the miners. So afraid to the point of leveraging the average user misconception of core as "official" to shut down proposals they don't like.
I think miners can do a lot because of they way bitcoin is designed. You think they're puppies following nodes. Either you or the core devs are wrong. Choose one.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:03:20


Yes, miners seek profit.
But if they ALL change networks, they can kill one of the chains. This is not an efficient strategy. They need BOTH chains alive to maximize profit. The miner's collective pool of revenues is 50 BTC + 50 BCH each ~10 minutes. If one of the coins is grinded to a halt that will probably means lower prices and so they'll lose a lot of money.
A good example: BCH was mined until now at a loss. Why? Because some miners think it is in THEIR best interest to keep it alive to maximize their long term profits. A little bit of hashrate with "opinion about the code" will always stick to one of the sides, no matter what.
This is classic game theory problem. Probably miner behavior switching back and forth can be modelled as a differential equation similar to a spring movement equation. A "whip effect" is expected to happen, but I don't thing it will take any side to a halt, there will be a "dampening effect" caused by miners that won't switch and by miners understaning how to better time the switches in a way not to kill one of the chains. The long term nash equilibrium of strategies is probably a mix of some hashrate switcihing back and forth fast, some taking time to switch and some hashrate not switching at all. But this is very hard to model, as price is part of the profit equation.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:56:03


Until they don't? They may do it. Or maybe not.
Miners and economically relevant nodes are both descentralized groups. It is hard to predict what'll happen. The best strategy for each individual agent will vary depending on the situation, leading to different equilibriums.

This is not how the market works. It is trading at 5% BTC price because that what the market is willing to pay for it. It could be only 1 person selling and trade even below that, it could be everyone selling and trade above that. Price have nothing to do with the ratio of people who dumped, there are many more variables. BCH is very low on transactions count and most addresses are inactive. Most people haven't touched the coins.
And the baseline for the fork IS NOT the BTC price (you don't get double the worth out of thin air). It was $0, it came from nothing. So it went from $0.00 to 5% of BTC price - that is a market where buying is stronger than selling. If 95% of BTC holders (measured in coins) had dumped the BCH they got the price would have been much lower.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:44:08
Trying to wage a psyops naming war is not the way to go. BTC should triumph over competitors by its own merits, by having the better tech. Not because of an inherited name.
Bitcoin will go foward if it can deliver better solutions to scalability, fungibility, privacy and so on. Not by inventing a new name to every fork that happens. If you're just here because of the name and network effect, well... Rethink your position.
Trying to rename a competitor created by hard fork don't help at all in the long run. You can call BCH or any other fork with any name you like. The hard fork supporters can call BTC any way they want. None of this silly games matter much. Bcash? Bgold? Bcore? Bdiamond? Bsilver? I'll fork BTI, "Bitcoin Itcoin" just to se you call it b+itcoin = bitcoin. Or maybe Bitcoin Itch = Bitch. LOL

Just wait for it: YES, OF COURSE. There is no "natural monopoly". There is only one electrical distribution company in each area just because government - in bed with the companies - want it to be this way.
Read it: "Six electric light companies were organized in the one year of 1887 in New York City. Forty-five electric light enterprises had the legal right to operate in Chicago in 1907. Prior to 1895, Duluth, Minnesota, was served by five electric lighting companies, and Scranton, Pennsylvania, had four in 1906. … During the latter part of the 19th century, competition was the usual situation in the gas industry in this country. Before 1884, six competing companies were operating in New York City … competition was common and especially persistent in the telephone industry … Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and St. Louis, among the larger cities, had at least two telephone services in 1905."

You are defending more regulation to solve a problem created by regulation. Thats nonsense.
We need less regulation right now, and the current FCC chairman view of not regulating internet as an utility is right on the spot.
As we can't take down all the regulation at once, we have to start somewhere. It is not the best way, but its better than keeping the current burdensome regulations that are just killing smaller ISPs right now.


Government cannot protect any consumer, nor create wealth, raise income or do anything positive with laws and regulations. Regulations are just words on a paper, they always mean a distorted market (one customer is ripped off on behalf of other) and/or higher costs (everyone pays for that benefit - it can't and never will come from the government). The only thing a government can do to help the markets function better for everyone is to defend property rights and enforce contracts, nothing more.
Example: here in Brazil we have a very strict "consumer protection" laws that costs companies a lot of money. Who pays that? The consumer, with higher prices, the same cars sold in USA cost double here. We also have one of the worst labor laws in the whole world, to "protect the employees", and what companies do to survive? Offer lower salaries than they would in a free market! They have to take into account a total costs of employment of at least 2x and sometimes rising to 2,5-3 times the salary when you take into account lawsuits. We could have double salaries for everyone just getting rid of all labor laws here.
There is no free lunch! Don't be naive!

This is just wrong. If you really think like that you could never understand the true value that bitcoin hold.
Gold was already deflationary in prices (quantity of gold increased slower than output after the industrial revolution) and was the western world money standard for thousands of years. No problem at all.
Deflationary currencies don't exist right now just because governments like inflationary currencies better. But they're inflating them so much its all going kabum soon. The goal of bitcoin is to go back to free market sound money, to make fiat useless, to denationalize money. You can even say we're not seing a crypto bubble, but in reality the beginning of the huge collapse of fiat money.

In a free market money is just a token that certifies you did a valuable service for the society, and can use this tokens to get the things you want from the society .
The problem is not money. It's big government and our crony capitalism system. And bitcoin was created to help make markets a little bit more free by taking away the money management from the governments.

You're confusing a consequence as seen in YOUR eyes with the government intentions.
Taxation is theft, that makes government a racket. There is no ethical or logical way to define taxation as anything else.
Government, as a racket, is just protecting revenue sources from drying. That's why they don't want you killed or maimed.
Just like a mobster do: if the shops in his area stop selling well or are attacked by other mobsters or thieves, he'll have less income. He is not benevolent, he is just like the government: trying to protect your hability to generate income so he can keep taking it from you by force.

Fiat money is not a new a idea. And it FAILED everytime it was tried, like under the mongols. Nothing have been "outcompeted", we're just seeing and ongoing experiment after the end of bretton-woods, and one coming to an end.
"Chartalism" can only survive if it tries to emulate a commodity standard with a tight control on monetary supply. But there are so many incentives to make it loose that thats what eventually happen.
If you really think money can only come from the government, you should have NEVER bought bitcoin. You should put RIGHT NOW your money where your mouth is: open short positions against any crypto that tries to be money. Not one to close in a small dip from 9 to 8 or 7 or 6k, but a long-term one betting they are all going to zero. Lets see how it goes.

I'm not a newcomer to crypto. But I'm a newcomer (2017) to reddit.
I was banned the day of the fork for just posting a meme saying "what if I told you... you can hold both coins". It was the second most upvoted post on the "D day". I did not take any side. I was banned for saying you don't need to take sides if you don't want to. They later unbanned me (as I did nothing wrong).
That ban made me think there is something shady going on here.
I'll not take this out of my head so soon. In my humble opinion there are shady things going on on both sides. I'll just hold both coins plus 2-3 of the better alts out there. I don't see a reason to dump one for another. I got BCH for free, the free tokens will just sit there, if it is worth $0, $1 or $10k in the future I don't care, its a free hedge and I'll keep that hedge going.

"Net neutrality" regulation as written right now = anything can be censored by the government. Can you change your government (I'm not talking about dem or rep, but the establishment) as easily as you change ISP?
I'm not kidding. They just don't do it because of the popular upveal it would cause. FCC regulations are pretty much like the brazilian internet law, that was sold as "net neutrality" but in reality is huge text full of backdoors giving government full power over the internet. Its not just 2 lines saying "all packets needs to be treated equal", it have dozens of pages full of badly written and ambigous text that just gives a lot of power to the government to decide on the fly what is "fair" and can keep going and what is not.
Just look at whats hapenning in Brazil: court orders blocked whatsapp a few times already. This is just the beggining. This is the politicians wet dreams and the end game to all of that: finding any excuse to control the internet.
The internet is working fine. Don't let the filthy hands of the government desecrate it. We just need less government pulling the strings, not more, so we can have more competition.

Title II under COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934.
Read the Title II. It starts on page 34 of the 300-page regulation act (how the fuck 300 pages of retulations are needed is beyong me).
There are a lot of open holes for government intervention, like this one:
"The Commission may obtain from such carriers and from persons directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, such carriers full and complete information necessary to enable the Commission to perform the duties and carry out the objects for which it was created."
What constitute "full and complete information"? This can be easily twisted to go against whatsapp when the company fail to deliver intercepted comms under a court order because it have end-to-end encryption. And its also easy to put whatsapp under that regulation: while it is not an ISP, it have ALL the caracteristics of a title II carier, just don't own the infraestrucure (it is exatly the same thing as a virtual carrier).
This is just ONE example, the evil minds working for the government can find a lot of loopholes to justify almost anything they want. They just don't do that right now because of the dissent it would cause.
The text is just full of words like fair and reasonable. What is reasonable? Its up to the government to decide on the fly. Thats a door wide open for government control over the internet.
The brazilian bill that allowed judges to block whatsapp for a period of time (as some sort of punishment) is the same: a large and vague text, not written in an obective way, that leaves it all to interpreation.
This act is a huge mess of badly written vague definitions. Even the FCC said they're only enforcing parts of it. If they wanted they could do a lot of harm tomorrow. The way it is written just anything goes. Even a government-loving liberal like you should be in favor of getting rid of it right now in favor of a more concise piece that gives NO POWER for the government to mess with the internet. And not by the hands of an agency, but by law, including all protections for the private citizens against not only the carriers, but most importantly against any kind of government sniffing or control.

Total worldwide wealth is US$241 trillion.

And narrow money (just coin, deposits and checking accounts) around US$41 trillion.
If bitcoin gets 100% of narrow money share we're talking about US$2M each BTC.  So 10% share would be US$200k BTC.

Almost anywhere you have more than 1 option of ISP because of that. Most urban areas have at least 3 options: one by telephone cable, one by TV cable, one by radio. And we are a huge and poor country! It baffles me when some of you guys complaint about having just 1 option. If an area here have only 1 carrier and its charging to much or delivering a bad service, I can just lay a big cable from the nearest competitor to a high ground, buy a big link wholesale, set up an antenna (or rent space in one) and cover the area with internet by radio. From under the price of an apartment I can have a local small ISP, I just need an antenna, a truck to do service, someone to help in field service and a network guy.

You have learned to do buy and hold. To invest in VALUE for the long term. You can apply this to any other asset you buy, be it stocks, real estate, whatever. It is the best way for an individual investor to behave: buy assets that have VALUE, don't worry so much about the price, hold it.

Google and facebook do phone calls, that can put them under Title II in court as virtual carriers.
The title II regulation badly written. It just say there can be no discrimination of service, it have to be "fair and reasonable". Thats an open door for government to do as he wishes - he can define on the fly what is "fair and reasonable".
Also from another message of mine, this time about whatsapp:
Title II under COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934.
Read the Title II. It starts on page 34 of the 300-page regulation act (how the fuck 300 pages of retulations are needed is beyong me).
There are a lot of open holes for government intervention, like this one:
"The Commission may obtain from such carriers and from persons directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, such carriers full and complete information necessary to enable the Commission to perform the duties and carry out the objects for which it was created."
What constitute "full and complete information"? This can be easily twisted to go against whatsapp when the company fail to deliver intercepted comms under a court order because it have end-to-end encryption. And its also easy to put whatsapp under that regulation: while it is not an ISP, it have ALL the caracteristics of a title II carier, just don't own the infraestrucure (it is exatly the same thing as a virtual carrier).
This is just ONE example, the evil minds working for the government can find a lot of loopholes to justify almost anything they want. They just don't do that right now because of the dissent it would cause.
The text is just full of words like fair and reasonable. What is reasonable? Its up to the government to decide on the fly. Thats a door wide open for government control over the internet.
The brazilian bill that allowed judges to block whatsapp for a period of time (as some sort of punishment) is the same: a large and vague text, not written in an obective way, that leaves it all to interpreation.
This act is a huge mess of badly written vague definitions. Even the FCC said they're only enforcing parts of it. If they wanted they could do a lot of harm tomorrow. The way it is written just anything goes. Even a government-loving liberal like you should be in favor of getting rid of it right now in favor of a more concise piece that gives NO POWER for the government to mess with the internet. And not by the hands of an agency, but by law, including all protections for the private citizens against not only the carriers, but most importantly against any kind of government sniffing or control.

Don't let governments interfere with the internet. The FCC shouldn't even exist.
Any "net neutrality" law is a door wide open to governments to do anything they want in the future, and also to have wide open acess to all ISP data. Whatsapp was blocked a few times here in Brazil by judges using the same law that included net neutrality (the "internet civil regulation", "marco civil da internet" in portuguese).
It is hard to believe that a community once full of libertarians is supporting something so naive like that. Nothing good can come from the government. Seriously, every law or regulation that may look good have backdoors in it to give more power for the government. Just get the politicians dirty hands away from the internet, don't try to steer the government to something you think is good. Governments have the midas' touch in reverse: anything they touch turns into shit, and no amount of pressure can change that.

The net neutrality bill was used by brazilian judges to take down Whatsapp 3-4 times here. It gives full power to the government to spy on ISPs and do as he wishes. You have to be really, REALLY naive to think anything good can come from that.

We're not talking about net neutrality as a good or bad thing. We're talking about government regulations. You have to be really naive if you think surrendering more power to the government is a good thing. They always sell a regulation like it have just one or two lines of text saying a good thing for the customers, but it is NEVER like that. NEVER. It is always 99% bullshit. You have to give 99 to win 1, how's that as a gamble? It is always just more power for the government and less competition in the market at the expense of the people.
I'll copy and paste it from another redditor:
"I don't think anyone is against the concept of Net Neutrality. The disagreement is in implementation and efficacy. The arguments against Title II are that:
A) It's a 1930s regulation that has nothing to do with net neutrality. It has 47 sections, but the FCC claims it will only apply 6 of those sections to broadband for now. They can change their interpretation and enforce all 47 sections at any moment. The net neutrality language that's enforced is "All practices must be just and reasonable," where the FCC decides the definition of just and reasonable. The law is completely left up to interpretation.
B) Because the regulation is so vague and heavy handed, the reporting requirements are expensive and don't scale down for small ISPs. This gives large ISPs a competitive advantage. When Title II was first implemented, small ISPs were given a waiver. However this waiver was taken away last year. If you follow the debate, this was the trigger point for Pai to fight against Title II. Most of his lobby money comes from small ISP groups, and he fought hard to keep the waiver. When the waiver was lost, his only choice was to begin fighting to kill Title II completely.
C) Title II does not protect net neutrality. Right now Riot Games (makers of League of Legends) pays ISPs to redirect player traffic to their private backbone to reduce lag. This is a private fast lane that violates net neutrality yet is legal under Title II. It's probably legal because of point A: Title II is a vague 1930's regulation with nothing to do with net neutrality.
The brilliant part of this debate is that it has been sold as net neutrality vs no net neutrality. Of course everyone wants net neutrality. The correct question is whether or not Title II achieves the vision for net neutrality in a fair way. Some people think no, some people think yes."

People doing that don't know anything about the VALUE of bitcoin. They can only see the PRICE. They see the price skyrocket and want a piece of it. They're the ones more likely to buy at the peak and sell at the bottom, in panic, be it bitcoin, stocks, bonds, houses, anything. Taking a loan to do that just adds more drama to the future windfall.
Of course it may work for some of them. We don't know the future, bitcoin can go to $15k in a blink. So the ones doing that right now can pay the loans and keep the change, but there'll be a new wave of people taking loans to buy crypto, and then again if the second wave make some money, until a crash in price and a lot of panic and tears.
This kind of behaviour will just create more volatility for bitcoin. Just HODL (with no debt, of course), sit back and enjoy the ride.

He said they are not good with money. As soon as she knows, she'll quit the job and dream of a big house, overseas trips, jewlery, nice cars and so on. She will not cope well with the idea of having almost 2 million in some weird crypto asset and not spending most of it.
If he don't want to spend, she'll be happy to leave with 100 BTC in the pocket to spend after divorce. If she spend it all, he just HODL his half and BTC goes to $500k and beyond, you can bet she'll reopen the case and ask for more money and alimony. Cases like that happens all the time. Unfortunatly money can easily ruin everything. Like other redditors said, just look at the lottery winner's divorce rate!


I agree with you. But the solution is not to think "I marry her so I should trust". Most of the time it's like "I shouldn't have married her". Most women right now are not marriage material. Modern mariage is a losing game for man. Don't marry, but if you do, have a pre nup.

Thats easy: if you're an ASIC developer you can sell it at a price above the estimated present value of net future cash flows of just using it in your own mining operation until earnings are overtaken by energy variable costs (so that would be the lifetime earnings of that unit before it becomes obsolete). Using present day BTC price and future estimated difficulty. This would mean you don't have any opportunity cost of selling them, you'll accrue it all on the sale.
This way anyone that have a better mining operation (lower energy costs, lower capital costs) can buy it by paying you all your expected mining earnings right now, and them use it to generate excess earnings (by better eff) to them. Or to anyone that is willing to do a bet on a higher BTC price or a lower difficulty increase curve than what you have estimated.

Did you donated ALL your crypto profits for charity? Or to developers? If you didn't, you are here for the money.
"Here for the money" is not a good way to say it. Just like in the stock market, EVERYONE is there for the money, but some are there for the VALUE and others for the PRICE.
I'm into crypto because of my libertarian background. And like all libertarians, I'm here for the value. I know fiat holds no value at all (it may have price today, but no value). I know cryptocurrencies are the best way, right know, to denationalize money, to achieve free-market private currencies competing with each other.
I don't know the exact cryptos that will win the long term race. I don't have to pick a winner between all cryptos. Even if I study the subject for 300 hours, I may still be wrong. It is better not just for me but for the entire crypto community that I rather spend all that hours just working more to buy more cryptos.
If you're so sure to "make a choice" picking the winner, good for you. Take a mortage on your house right now and become a billionaire in a few years. I'll not. Unfortunatly I don't have the gift of clairvoyance, so I need to diversify my investments.

There is no natural monopoly. The cost of entry right now is so high because of regulations. All markets with fixed infra were full of competition before government stepped in, be it train tracks, eletricity, gas, telephone and so on.
End all regulation and if your area don't have more internet options within 1 year I'll change my name to Net Neutrality.

Can't agree with LN. It is a mess right now. Capacity decreased (was over 1000btc). No meaningful real-world use. Messy to use and understand. People lost coins on it, and so on. We need other ways to scale in a descentralized way. Otherwise we'll lose the battle when the mainstream finance industry counterattack and start their venmo-like services that begin to offer crypto custody in a cheap and secure (albeit centralized: secured from common theft, not from the government) way. And maybe that is the end-goal of people who want to think of Bitcoin as gold and not as cash: stored in bank vaults, used by large banks and companies to settle banknotes pegged to it...

I'll repeat, is very very very easy to understand: there is no possible ethical reasoning for taking money by force from other human beigns, unless you are here defending slavery. The is no social contract. Taxation is theft and the government is a racket. Just like the mob, you just pay because otherwise bad things will happen to you - and just like the mob, the government provide a few services here and there, like protecting you from the mob itself and also "protecting you" from other groups of mobsters (otherwise they lose income).

It is BY DEFINITION, in a free market.
You might not see any value in what he did, but this is IRRELEVANT. Value is subjective. It is not up to decide if what he did holds value.
He bought, held and stored safely a commodity that people want to pay 2 million for it right now. It is not me, you or the OP who decide if that have any value or not. It's the ones that provided 2 million in services and products to society and are willing to exchange all that fiat for crypto who decides.
Buying a cheap commodity in times of more supply than demand for selling later when it is more scarce is a valuable service to society: by doing that he is adding a little bit of demand when there was almost none, and now he can offer the commodity for someone who wants and needs it more than in the past. If he sells he is adding supply now that the commodity is ultra scarce. It doesn't matter if he did it by luck, society still thinks it is great and are willing to reward him for it.
Of course everything said don't hold truth to government employees, robbers or anyone that gain money taken from others by force or fraud. We're just talking about voluntary transactions: they generate wealth and value by definition.

It does not.
No one have a right over your body, your work, your life, your property. Trying to take anything from you by force is theft. This simple fact trumps over any utilitarian argument you may have.
The first government was formed when one tribe discovered that it is more profitable to demant tribute from the one they defeated in battle, instead of killing everyone and stealing everything right away. Government is just a racket.


A monopoly that you can't control if it goes rogue is a terrible thing. But a "monopoly that you can't control" is the DEFINITION of government, it have monopoly of law over a territory and modern governments have so much power that people are just doomed if it goes rogue. You're just saying without government there would be eventually "something as bad as government" - so you're just saying government is bad, just like I do.

You should carefully check your country laws.
In some countries like Brazil, all financial institutions have "unilimited responsability", including unions. This means if the credit union is broke and left any unpaid liability, you'll be called to answer that with your personal assets. So its just not worth it, too big a risk.

Going out of business is likely for any business that engage in fractionary reserves like all modern banks. It means they are inherently insolvent. The credit insurance in any country don't have not even the money to support a medium bank going under, you should check their balance sheet. This means it WILL go under and you'll get a haircut in your balances (or even lose it all) or the government will step in and bail them out. Both are terrible options.

You can define money as the most liquid asset in an economy. It was cows, shells, gold, silver and other things in the past.

Upvoted. I really like to read the whitepaper and also satoshi's messages.
Like this one, a huge food for thought:


for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.


would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.


sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

He envisioned only datacenters mining, thats about the same concentration we have right now in mining (maybe we're at risk while there is only one top player making ASICs, but that'll probably change soon).


Decentralization is a continuum, not a discrete variable that you either have or don't. Each additional node provides diminishing returns in terms of increased resilience. The question I ask is: how many nodes are needed for a great level of protection against censorship and disruptions (be it an absolute number or a function of any other number, like TPS or user count), and how many would we have right now if only miners ran full nodes, like in Satoshis's envisioned scenario?

@_date: 2018-04-24 14:18:40
Finished reading.
I'll not check every number, I'll just assume the calculations are correct.
If we do huge blocks, 1 billion users, 1 billion transactions/day, 100k full nodes, the whole story they put there, and pay for the full nodes with fees or new coins (do a hard fork to reward full nodes), that would be at least $2 for each transaction. This would be the cost of "infinite scalling" with the tech we have right now. This is not what we want to achieve, we need better tech for worldwide billion-user scalling (and just a note: that state just is not real: no one would do 1 tx a day if the fee is around $2, this state is not in equilibrium, number of transactions and cost of "full node fees" would be different).
In the end, the problem is:


I've not checked this info by myself, but if this is true, thats the bottleneck to tackle in "satoshi's vision".
I don't know how much work is being done to solve that, but I'm glad we have two networks trying different things. If big blocks is a bust, we'll still have BTC running strong without any issue. There needs to be no hate for BCH if we think of it as a big testnet for a different path foward.

It is not fair nor equal at all. Inflation is not neutral. 
It would only be neutral if worked like a stock split: everyone gets 2 cents more for each dollar and all prices increase in 2%.
But thats not how it works. The ones who gets the new money first can use it to buy things at current outdated prices without adding production to the economy, stealing value from everyone else. And who gets it first? The government and its cronies. The prices will increase only after the new money is spread trought the economy.

BCH and Roger Ver against BTC is just a drop in the ocean of things to come when the Bitcoin begins to REALLY challenge the state monopoly over money and the power of the banking cartels. Brace for impact. Enjoy the ride. And hodl.

He is not talking about the initial state of bitcoin, that quote come from an email about future scalling.
I'll quote it again:
"Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes. **At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware**. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node."
Thats what he tought about the future, be it right or wrong: big blocks, miners running full nodes in server farms, regular users with SPV wallets. You can say he is wrong (there are issues with scalling SPV queries to full nodes for it to work well without a huge cost), you can say he is outdated because of asics or pools or anything you like to use as an excuse, but don't try to change what he said. It is written in a very clear way: running a full node would be left to to server farms that are also doing mining.

Built with resources taken by force.


You want to take my money by force because someone took a land by force and extrated something from it? This makes absolutly no sense. You're trying to justify theft (taking resources by force) NOW because theft ocurred in the past. Two wrongs don't make a right. Lets nuke NY because Hiroshima. LOL³


This makes no sense. Private property comes from self-ownership. I'm not a slave to society neither to the government. I've aquired property with original apropriation and voluntary transactions, I have no debt, I own NOTHING to you, to the government or to anybody else. If I do, show me the promissory note, let me pay it and go free, will you? You will not. Because that doesn't exist. Its just fugazi. Just like the "social contract".


The kind of public good or service that materialize out of thin air do not exist. The government can't create wealth, anything it does come from resources taken by force from its rightful owners.
I'm surprised to read stuff like you wrote here on r/bitcoin. I'm even more surprised that your reply is upvoted, thats insane. I wonder when the socialists began to infiltrate bitcoin communities. What was once a libertarian community now is just another cesspool of bootlickers trying to reason ways to justify plain simple theft. Why are you here?

I don't have a right to take your money by force. If I gang with 5 other guys, we still don't have that right. But if I gather enough people (millions? the majority inside imaginary lines?), then it become justified? How? Magical fairy dust? What makes sex not rape? Consent. What makes a job not slavery? Consent. What makes a transaction not robbery? Consent. What makes taxation no theft?
Your concept of democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on whats will be the dinner.
Self-ownership and private property are natural rights. Your property is yours to use as you see fit and nobody have a right to take it from you, be just the robber around the corner or a mass of people in uniforms calling themselves "the governent". A true democracy CAN'T vote away someone's rights or justify theft.
Taking money from someone by force is theft. Taxation is theft. Take the red pill awake from the matrix, my friend.

Yes, it is 1 more to overcome. And yes, it is diminishing returns in terms of security. **You said it yourself**, you just didn't realize it:
"It is easy for 1,000,000 people to run 1 node, it is not as easy for 1 person to run 1,000,000 nodes."
Read what you said slowly and carefully. Got it yet?
When you have a very low number of nodes, the number of entities that have the resources to attack the network (if that person or organization want it) is very high. Each additional nodes excludes scores of potential attackers, up until there is very few entities (or none) who would be able to muster the resources to attack the network.
Lets say you have 4 nodes and 50 million entities in the world who could muster the resources do deploy 5 nodes. Now you add 1 node, the number of entities who can deploy 6 nodes will drop by at least a few hundred, if not a few or a dozen thousand.
When you reach 40 nodes, there will still be a lot of entities who can deploy 41 nodes to attack you. Adding a node will decrease that number, but not by the same margin as when you added the sixth node.
When you reach 1.000.000 nodes, lets say there is just 1 entity who can deploy 1 million plus 1 nodes (USA government? a large company? it doesn't matter, lets just say there is only one). Then you add a node. It is VERY LIKELY that an entity that can deploy 1.000.001 nodes can also deploy 1.000.002 nodes. Maybe its maximum threshold is 1,1 million.
So you need an increasing number of nodes for each level of additional security. The first ones drives away potential attackers by the thousands for each additional node. After a certain level, you need several nodes to just drive away one the next marginal potential attacker (the one still in the pool of potential attackers, but with the lowest resource threshold). **That's diminishing returns by definition. Each aditional node do help increase security, but by a smaller and smaller margin for each added node.**
Its just like in economics! Bitcoin's full nodes follow the law of marginal utility when it comes to security (each aditional unit have decreasing marginal utility in terms of added security and resilience). This is very easy to understand and very basic.

Did you even read the whitepaper?
"The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote."
and then
"Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof- of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."

You can fork today, use modified Core code and call it "Bitcoin Cobra" or whatever you may fancy. You can have 200k hash/second in a Celeron or 2 exahash/second in a new superminer only you own, it does not matter. It can only be called an "attack" if someone owns the code or the coin name, and I don't think this is the case for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:42:14


Just like Satoshi Nakamoto did. He clearly says that clients should run SPVs and miners should run full nodes. Word by word, in his emails.
So Bitcoin Cash is just "Bitcoin as designed by Satoshi Nakamoto".
Small blockers that are in love with full nodes are supporting "Bitcoin as designed by Core/Blockstream".
With the fork we'll have a way to test both implementations. Let the market decide what is the better one.


Sorry, but this is not the designed governance structure for bitcoin. The original governance is very clear in the whitepaper: vote with CPU power.
If you think non-mining full nodes are a good thing to have, then why not push for incentives for full nodes, just like other coins are doing? We know more transactions go in line with price, so the incentive to cover the full node's costs will be in line with a dinamic block size.
There are many better ways to "save the non-mining full nodes" than keeping the blocksize small.

It is really beyond my comprehension how the hell can you call higher fees an attack if this is just a weakness of today's core code. Higher fees happens because today BTC just can't scale. If this is an attack, easy way to defend: just increase blocksize to lower fees. OH, WAIT.... LOL³
Increased demand for space in blocks can't be called an attack. It is just people using the network as they wish. Let them, its their coins, not yours. An event that increases demand for something is not an attack. Unless you think holidays are an "attack on hotel prices", or black friday is an "attack on non-crowded full price shopping"... Nonsense. They're all just events.


It is just an event. And a big one. You have to adapt to any big event happening in anything that have any relation to your life, be it a holiday in your country or a hard fork in your favorite crypto. Just deal with it. Having to change your behavior does not mean the event is an attack.
The right question is: DO YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING TO DEFEND YOUR BTCS?
The answer is: you don't. If your BTCs are safe before the event, they'll be safe after. You don't have to do "defend" anything because it is not an attack.

It is not that simple: there are a lot of weird stuff on BOTH sides. And both sides have some evidence of shady stuff. And both sides are full of blind supporters buying rumors at face value.
The time and money it would take me to do a truly neutral full skeptical investigation on all the FUD, accusations and allegations from both sides is just huge. It is just easier to take no side and just hold both. Even if you like one side more than another, be it for technical or political reasons, is it worth the gamble? I mean, even if you think with 99% certainty that one side will win, if you're wrong you may lose it all.


As far as I know, they'll hold their part of the agreement. The agreement is just about the hashpower they use in the BTC network. That doesn't mean they can't use some or all their hashpower to mine bitcoin cash or whatever coin they may fancy. But to say the truth, I don't care anymore about what people on one side or the other do or do not. If a crypto is not strong enough to survive a few greedy hijackers it just deserve to die and be replaced by another. Let the free market and competition do its thing.

Bitcoin cash code does not require anything as you're not forced to claim your BCCs/BCHs. That said, if you WANT to claim them and want to split the coins for increased security, you can. If this results in higher fees, thats a scale weakness in core's code, not something you can blame bitcoin cash's developers.

Just control your private keys and do nothing. You'll have both BTC and BCC on the different chains, same addresses.

To move your BCCs you'll need a compatible wallet.

That would not be fair at all, the coins are not theirs to sell. The claim over the BCCs belong to the ones that own the BTC, and the BTCs in the trading accounts are owned by their clients, not the exchange.
If they don't want do support BCC trading, thats fine. But at the moment of the fork they should make a "BCC withdraw" option for the ones that care about it.
It is not up to exchanges to take a side. The users/holders/miners/nodes are the ones who will legitimize BCC or not.

It is much closer to the original Bitcoin and to Nakamoto's envisioned coin (he said itself only miners need to run full nodes) than the segwit/core coin. You can even see BCC as a the legacy chain, and BTC as the new implementation, since BTC is the one that have much more different lines of code than the original Bitcoin.
Bitcoin as envisioned is a P2P electronic cash system. Not a settlement layer for offchain scalling. So a coin trying to do onchain scalling have a LOT to do with Bitcoin.
You can argue that BTC is technically a better implementation, in your opinion. You can argue that onchain scalling is wrong (implying you think Nakamoto was wrong). Thats fine. I don't know the right answer to that. But you can't say BCC have nothing to do with Bitcoin.

Ever since day one mining power is debated. There are built in incentives to keep everything OK: a 51% attacker can't do much besides double spending his own coins (he have more to gain just keeping mining in a honest way).
You're saying that Nakamoto's was wrong without even reading what he said in the past.

@_date: 2017-07-28 17:02:36


They are just trying to make the coin survive. BCC will probably have a much lower hashrate. If it gets 5% hashrate form BTC, it would take 10 months for the difficulty do go down, taking 3 hours to mine each block. So it would be dead on arrival.
If it was the other way around (BTC going big blocks with most of the hashrate, small blockers forking), the small blockers would certainly do the same.
Miners will just follow the money. They want maximum return on their investment. You can't blame them for that. You have no right over miner's hashrate, the hardware is their property to use as they wish.

It is not an "attack". They are just forking they way out with replay attack protection. They are going their own way peacefully. No one is pointing a gun to force you to use Bitcoin Cash. 
They'll try to use big blocks to compete against segwit + LN. May the best coin win.
As I don't have the gift of clairvoyance, I'll just HODL both coins and watch the events unfold. Just chill down, make some popcorn, grab a beer and enjoy the ride!

Why "hedge into BCC"? You can just do nothing and you'll already have a hedge: your BCCs in your wallet. If you control your private keys you can get them anytime you want.

You're using the word P2P as if it was a measurable variable. It is not. It is just a word to describe network architectures that are not client-server. Paypal is not P2P. Bitcoin is.
Bitcoin with big blocks is still a "P2P electronic cash system". It only becomes paypal if for any reason only ONE server farm in the whole world can run a full node, and thats not gonna happen.
If you're trying to talk about the AMOUNT OF DESCENTRALIZATION of a crypto's network, thats ok. But this is not a freestyle talk, it is a numbers game. How do you measure it? How much is too little?  How do you include in your model the price? How much is the optimum balance between capacity and descentralization AS A FUNCTION of number of users, transaction damand and token price?
Those are not rhetorical questions. I have not see so far a good answer. As we don't know the answer, trying two different approaches is a good thing.

There is no real "legitimate or not" binary decision. It is up to each miner to decide. A tx that follow the code but is dishonestly exploiting a bug in the code will be rejected. [Just like was done twice in BTC past.]( No problem at all as long as miners profit more by beign honest nodes than by trying to steal or double spend.

BCH had a 2 block reorg due to a bug. There was a 24 block reorg in BTC also due to a bug in the past. If you really care about reorgs you should also dump BTC. In both cases miners rejected blocks they don't agree to and refused to work on them. Working as intended, from Satoshi himself in the  [whitepaper](


Both chains are protected by the same principle: it is more profitable for the miners to stay honest than to steal or double spend. Thats why BTC is alive to this day (despite reorgs), thats why BCH is still alive. Otherwise the largest miners would have already colluded to do bad things.

Do you think you're entitled to other person's work, services or products? LOL
I tought the BTC enviroment was libertarian...
He can do as he pleases. Why you don't develop your hardware to mine instead of begging for his?
What if he is a toxic/evil/bad person and take down bitcoin with his money and power? Well, then bitcoin wasn't a strong crypto, wasn't resilient enough and deserved to die to be replaced with a better one that worked better with human incentives. Let's not be ego-invested in just one cryptocurrency. Sit down, relax and enjoy the ride. Cryptos are still just in beta.

Thats not the definition of peer. In a tor network you have to trust the other peers that the files you are downloading does not have malware.
If you have no central authority in the network it is P2P. There is no required amount of work to be a peer. In most of P2P networks you can do a lot, do a little, do only ups or only downs and still be a peer.
But this discussion about P2P goes nowere, you already got what I meant and this is not the main point.


This is the main point. There are two problems with this argument of % of nodes and small block size.
1) A percentage may not be the best number. Its easier to hijack a network of 100% full nodes if it have 100 full nodes running all in one country, in the same ISP, running the same software. It is much more difficult to hijack a network with 1% full nodes, but with this 1% meaning 1000 full nodes with 10 different implementations, scattered around the globe in 120 different countries. I don't think even the USA government could do that. Thats probably resillient enough. So full node absolute number and diversity (in software, ISP provider, geography, and so on) are two important numbers.
2) Even if a percentage is a good number and you need that % of full nodes, the best way to "save the full nodes" is not keeping the blocksize low, but creating an incentive for running a full node. Number of users, blocksize and price would all fluctuate togheter, and so would the incentives in crypto to run full nodes.
And I'm not an expert on blockchain, but I think only archival full nodes would need an incentive. The other ones can just keep the unspent output in memory, to keep the cost down. 
That's what should be the main debate: full-node incentives that covers some or all the costs, not blocksize. The fact is that blocksize is the main discussion is a sad one, it was never meant to protect full nodes, it was just to protect from spam. And another fact is that a lot of core developers are paid by a company that seeks future profit with off-chain solutions. You can connect the dots.
To get any real scale with off-chain, you still need HUGE gains in blocksize over 1mb (there are a lot of studies about that, LN still needs a lot of blocksize space to scale). The elephant is still in the room, we just painted it white.

You want to supress an idea. You want people to don't even know about it. I don't. I want every single person to know what is going on and make its informed decision, either to hold, dump or don't care for the BCCs.
And if you think the government doing violent action against private money is something good, my god, what the hell are you even doing with bitcoin? Go back to fiat right now, you don't belong here, leave us be.

People on this side says "Craig Wright and Roger Ver, are senseless and deeply unscrupulous". And there are some evidence to back this claim.
People on the other side say Core/Blockstream are "senseless and deeply unscrupulous". And there are some evidence to back this claim.
I don't know who is right and I really don't care. I'll not spend my time trying to find out who is right. And they may be both right. The amount of FUD on both sides is so huge that its just impossible to make a correct judgement. So I'll just hold both and wait.
And I really don't care about the people in either side. Any coin that is doomed because of "unscrupulous" people involved in mining or development is just not resilient enough and NEEDS to fall and be replaced by one with a better governance structure. Cryptocurrencies are not even beta yet. Lets just sit down, hold coins and enjoy the ride. Don't be so ego-invested in any coin or coin version.

You are talking like if you or someone owns the Bitcoin name or the public ledger. You don't. No one does.
Don't call a HF a "hostile takeover attemps". Take over what? From who? Who owns this thing they're trying to "hijack"? This makes no sense at all.
They are peaceful going their own way, with replay attack protection. You don't need to follow. No one is pointing a gun at you. It is not a "hijack".
If you want you can do a HF tomorrow with your own resources. I can do to with my own resources. You can call it "Bitcoin Green Turtle", BGT. You can make it 2 Tb blocks or 1 kb blocks. The information in the public ledger does not have an owner. Gosh, we can even make it fork 10 times each block with 1 different line of code each time (even if its broken). So what? No one is hurt. No one lost its property or its life.
Who will decide who wins in the long term? Competition.
Don't be afraid of competition. If BTC is better than BCC, just chill down. You can sell your BCC, you can do nothing, you can hold BCC, do whatever you want. But just don't spread FUD like that. A HF is one group peacefully going away. Deal with that.

Honest miners with knowledge of the exploit would help a coordinated rollback. Just like they did in BCH.  [Just like was done twice in BTC past.](
Right now the 4 largest BTC pools can talk to eachother and do a 2 block reorg (like was the BCH one) in the blink of an eye. Is that a problem? No. The security of the network is not something like "it is impossible to do a reorg". It is just that miners can profit more by beign honest nodes than any nother option. Incentives matter.

Did Satoshi Nakamoto understood? Because he clearly says that dataservers should run nodes (and there are many more than 10 willing to do that).
Listen to him:
"Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day. Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes. At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware. A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. 
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices."
So you're saying the creator of bitcoin got it wrong.
He MAY BE wrong. But a huge statement like "nakamoto was wrong" requires huge proofs and evidences, and I don't see any.

I think they will, in time. They are just saying they can't support BCC out of the box.
Just like a stock split, each BTC will generate the right to one BCC. Your stock broker can't keep splitted stocks to itself. So does the crypto exchanges. In the event of a big split like that, they have a duty do redeem the split coins to the customers.

Why not? R&amp;D is a valid competitive advantage in a free market.
Just develop your own hardware. If you don't have the money, raise it in a crowfunding or a consortium of miners that want better equipment. There is no reason to restrain their liberty. Bitcoin is a free market environment.
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:55:05


Any node can follow any protocol they want, and do manual adjustments as much as they want. They are not slaves to any protocol. A valid tx that EXPLOITS bugs in the protocol or in the code of an implementation (and so end up in a block) CAN and WILL have its block orphaned by an honest miner that sees what happened. That happened before on the BTC chain, and also happened in the BCH chain.


They can do that right now. Two large polls can do that on BCH. Four large pools can do that on BTC. Why they don't? Because that would destroy the value of the chain and thus the value of their mining equipment. It is more profitable to them to stay honest. This is the main foundation of bitcoin security.
What happened on BCH is not "political position". It was first an exploit and after that new consensus fixing the problem. What would an honest miner do in the face of a exploit? Reject the block. Working as intended. Unless you think it would be better to BTC to have kept that exploitive tx creating billions of coins (2010 rollback)...


There is no "THE" protocol, like a top-down rule from god. Any node can run any protocol they want, accept or reject any block they want, for any reason they want to do that. A miner can accept or reject any block they want, and any block they mine can also be accepted or rejected by every other node. If the majority of miners and nodes reject a block - even if that block is "valid" according to faulty code that was fixed later - that is the new consensus, just like what happened to BCH now and BTC in the past.


They can, right now. But they don't. Because bitcoin does not work the way you think it works.
**The security DO NOT come from "it is impossible to do a reorg". The security come from "it is much more profitable to miners to stay honest nodes".**
If this wasn't the case, both BTC and BCH chains would be long dead, as they both did rollbacks. But they aren't dead.
As this is getting boring and non-productive, so this is my last message to you here. Cheers.

I don't see any evidence of that. But if thats what you think about that chinese gent, just don't hold any coin with that characteristics. 
That is why forks are good. What if your story of a comic-book villain trying to "takeover" was real and he DID took over BTC? You had the option to fork away in that case. Just as you are free to use or not use any coin he is currently mining and manufacturing equipment for.
Thats how free market regulation works: each one vote with their own resources. No one is pointing a gun to you and making you use a coin you think is controlled by that chinaboy. You can do as you want. And so do he. And you have no right to his hardware, that is my main point here. You just have the right to walk away.

It is actually at the level of liberarianism x socialism. The libertarian party in USA is the only one calling to end the FED.
What we have now is state-owned and managed money. We can even call it "montary socialism".
What cryptocurrency can help us achieve is de denationalization of money (read Hayek), a libertarian proposition.
And above it all, it is a matter of individual rights and freedoms.
