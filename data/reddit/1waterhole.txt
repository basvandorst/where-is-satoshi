I mine to get coins at a loss and without having to use my other Financials tools.  I do not spend those as that is a long term investment. .  I buy bitcoins to trade and profit on short term swings

I've helped a few companies through this transition. I haven't seen them hit the backups before that's kind of new but not surprising. I recommend buying Bitcoins through and legitimate firm like Circle, coin base or bitstamp. You will want a receipt for this transaction so that you can deduct it from your company's expenses at the end of the year. Good luck

Nice idea.

Hoping for better decision making in an open system seems futile. A hard fork could enforce a better tx ploicy

This is open source not a product and service. Brands matter to businesses and franchise owners. Bitcoin is far beyond that
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:36:26
Feel your pain but many people in this sub do not want btc to be used as cash. Other blockchains are filling the void while btc figures out if segwit and Ln will open up more transactions. But group culture does not transact, just hodl. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:35:57
Just seems that way. If I want to pay my sister $100 in bitcoin, I am not going to open a $100 channel with her and send the $100 and close out. We could use a central service that would allow other spending options. Them I could load a $1000 and buy coffee and other stuff. Right? That is a 3rd party intermediary. No?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:01:31
We got to stop telling people to keep their coins offline now. Keep them with Coinbase because it works...irony anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:46:23
This thread is annoying and unproductive. Naming and branding is the least interesting part of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:52:04
What if they are dumping fiat? No need to dump btc to get bch
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:39:29
That is true. Anyone can provide a third party solution still makes it a third party solution. not P2P. Users will gravitate to nodes with the biggest channels open, meaning the most coins in channel. This could give exchanges, miners and holders an advantage over new money entering the space. I am not knocking lightning. Just saying it is one technology on top of the old technology. Hopefully there will be competing solutions. Also LN does not require consensus. So just because it is available does not mean it will be adopted, like segwit. (although highly unlikely since it can be a source of income for big business than comply with KYC).
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:15:15
This is right but still does not sit right with me. Third parties solutions instead of P2P? Not sure how I feel about that

What about new people who want to try bitcoin? Let's say a mid aged woman who makes about $50K a year. Say she saves about $5K annually and wants to put 20% in bitcoin. That is $1,000 USD. So the entire investment should go to Lightning? No blockchain for that tax bracket?  Entry and exit fees could be a 20% tax. 
I have no problem with L2 tech. But I do not think L2 will save us if we can model it after a checking and savings account.  
@_date: 2015-12-22 21:29:03
What happens if bitcoin soft or hard forks before 2020? What is the risk of losing coins to unforseeable software changes? 
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:49:01
I agree with you! The core wallet needs to something besides warm my laptop up. All the tech is going to miners and POS systems
@_date: 2015-12-05 15:11:28
Very interesting concept. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 12:58:39

I have sent an email to your website because my first transaction did not go through and the money is in limbo.
Here are some suggestions:
1. Automate the transfer of funds from buyer to seller. I sent payment last night and the seller has not received it yet. Once this is cleared up, the value of BTC will be different creating an additional risk. You could always use a tested payment processor on the back end to outsource the function. 
2. Create a way to open a ticket and confirm the ticket.
3. Provide confirmation when an order is placed via on screen or email. 
4. Add a cancel order button on final order. If a buyer goes through all the steps and gets the BTC amount and does not have funds or wants to back out, they are stuck with the open invoice. 
5. Add a verified buyer stamp so buyers know if the vendor has been vetted
6. force vendors to post a profile and references (proof of sales)
7. Shipping....How does that work?  It would be best to write out the buying steps so buyers are not going in blind.
Overall, I like the idea and the products. There could be a huge market in what you are trying to do but the whole process is not fully thought out. With all the focus on the press releases, I hoped for a different experience. FYI check out suchlist.com by u/inquam.  He has been running a similar service for a while and I have had awesome experiences. He might have some pointers on the tech side. Good Luck!

Nascar is a perfect place for coins to compete--on the track. I would love to see a lot of new sponsors and people watching Nascar. Now if Bitcoin holders are willing to give up there precious coins, then we will have something. BTW... I am a loyal dogecar fan

I just signed up for circle. I love the insurance parts but all 3 of my cards would not link up. If they want to be different and a big part of BTC, they need to accept all cards with Visa, Mastercard ect...

Litecoin and Dogecoin walk into the classroom and say "hi bitcoin, you are the coolest kid in the class.  Let's be friends.  Bitcoin says "stop following me around you snotnose brats. I am 4 years old and way smarter than you" 
Copycatcoins are not ment to replace bitcoin but provide something to the users that bitcoin can't. For me,  litcoin is a secure coin due to market cap,  hashrate and liquidity.  Dogecoin is a niche community where you can make friends and have a good time. Bitcoin has utility and is the big brother but tends to forget that it is made to be copied. That is part of its utility.

maybe this is a scam, maybe not. If you feel that it is, dump the coins. If you do not and it is, then you loose you ass. This seems fair to me.  FYI- I am not buying in.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:30:39
I think the dump is from longterm holders, someone getting out after more than a year investment or a dump to lower the price. So current prices might not have any weight on decision to sell.

So lightning is for big bundles of transactions that companies will use.  But for person a person settlement we still need to use the blockchain? Hopefully some of the miners will move to lightning.

I am glad the economic incentives of Bitcoin work. People are making decisions based on economics rather than whose team you're on. In the long run this will make cryptocurrency bullish assuming coins pick the right economic code

Most buyers are going to wait until the market cools down and there is a sign of a floor before buying. Probably around $200-$250

I think there is a lot riding on Lightning roll out as well. I tried using the eclair app on testnet and was not impressed. I am somewhat tech saavy but found it a difficult and complicate user experience. Of course this can be fixed. Hopefully lightning will be noob user friendly. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:55:33
big fees are part of this forks plan. Just like gold, it is expensive to move around. Wait until the mempool clears
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:38:47
Hopefully segwit creates more competition. Lightning seems like a nice company But ultimately competition will drive down prices and give us more efficiencies.

Hostile take over? Bitcoin was designed to be competitive. We are seeing the economic realities of what was set in motion years ago. No one owns it so it can't be taken over. You either have the ability to make changes to the network or you don't. I guess we'll see the results in November. I am fairly confident that in the end Bitcoin will win

not sure. But the technical merits is not something non-techies understand or care to spend days trying to figure out. We see a divide, a compromise and a solution (seg2x).

the improvements I would like to see on the software side are to not having to disconnect a wallet when looking at different coins. But I would LOVE to have multisig capability. Sign transactions  and broadcast. 
Also to verify the device without the tiny little buttons would be nice

@_date: 2016-12-18 19:13:33
I have both Nano S and Keepkey. I like the Ledge Nano S but the KeepKey is much more user friendly. If you do many transactions, KeepKey is a better HW. If it is just for occasional use, saving $30 on the Nano S makes sense.

@_date: 2016-12-20 21:00:45
Same here. I signed up for Gemini and then found out I can't buy because of where I live. Other exchanges make it more difficult or have really bad charts or have been hacked over and over.

I think once you have a node set up, you will not need to settle. Instead we will pay process fee (onchain tx) to refill or withdraw funds from spending account(lnbtc). Services that convert LNBTC to BTC and and back will probably offer watchtowers so you dont have to worry about being online all the time. I would not be surprised if machine-to-machine payments are the heaviest users in lnbtc

It is not bitcoin but I have been giving bch to coworkers.  We have an office of 15 and everybody wants to try it. I am not paying the tx fee to give everyone the legacy chain coins. It is hard enough to explain bitcoin as it is. I guess this is good news for both coins. But bitcoin is not ready for on boarding unless someone is willing to commit $50usd worth.

Your assuming miners are not holders and users. If a miner is willing to invest in the mining bitcoin blocks because they believed in Bitcoin , would they not use their income which is in Bitcoin to purchase things and hold Bitcoin as a store of value. Your assumption is Miners sell right away for Fiat conversion prices and live and exist in a separate world. In truth I think miners have more transactions and use cases then General users. They've built an economy around Bitcoin. I'm not sure what general users biggest application is. For all I know it might be gambling.

I tried this and you are right, they have a 300K sat min ($15) to open a channel. You cant receive until you have spent some. I opened a channel but for some reason it closed on me creating an onchain tx fee. I am going to download (again) the blockchain and play with this later on full node.
I wonder who (and how many people) is working on solving these problems for light clients? or in general.... Hasn't this tech been out for 3 or 4 years?
 \*must have a full node running to receive payment or use an oracle 
\*cannot receive payment without spending in channel first (min required)
\*channels can force close and leave you with tx fee 
\*must be online to receive

nope. You can use eclair for spending only and BLW if you want to receive
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:09:20
I have been trying to use it for two days now. I finally found a smart phone app (Eclair) that allowed me to open a channel. The send was super quick but now I cannot receive my change. So I am looking for a wallet that will allow me to receive (Payment request/invoicing). I can not find anything without downloading core. It is frustrating to see development is still not ready for general use. Why is everyone bragging about how this tech is so awesome? Does everyone have full nodes running? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:25:08
How do others account for coins that they can't account for? For example, 1 btc that was a combination of 500 mining transactions, three or four trading transactions with no way to prove any of it. Companies out of business, lost details, ect
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:20:57
I was thinking about recording the coins as purchased this year at zero cost basis, using blockchain (pub add) to show a time date stamp. Then when I use the coins next year, I can use long term gains and the blochchain for proof. Still need to run it by accountant
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:45:24
bigger blocks=more on chain transactions
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:42:20
That makes sense. So it is more about maintaining consensus then arriving at consensus.

I see what you did there. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 21:17:09
If we don't agree then let's not run it. Banning something in a free market based in inclusivity only makes it that much more desirable
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:27:28
I understand the core narrative of scaling. In theory  same could be done with Bitcoin cash, dogecoin, etherium ect. My point is that growth in onchain transaction for Bitcoin is not in favor of all altcoins. It takes away a majority share of altcoins use cases.
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:38:07
That sounds so much easier. Then as long as the coins you spend haven't been spent in a year, you're good to go
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:53:14

A few altcoin went through this and there was not a higher price because the demand was not met with the supply already available. Basically, in the next five years, we need to find a killer app to increase demand while the supply decreases.

I do not carry cash. I have to go the grocery store, buy something and get cash back before going to pot store. That is the only thing i use for cash.  Bitcoin would encourage me to spend more money. Plus, can you imagine having to shuffle cash around at the end of day,,,,These companies are at risk for robbery without insurance.

I sold a 24 hour eth mine contract. The transaction was very easy. They did not use escrow, so that was nice. The only issue as a seller is there is no way to get notified via email on sale.

I tested it out and tried to send $5 to a friend. The app is slick but the user on the other end was not anymore willing to sign up with circle, connect their bank account for $5 then they were willing to do with bitcoin. This is just advertising development

circle.com is instant and cheap.
@_date: 2016-05-26 20:55:29
The last time I tried that, the receiver had to sign up for a circle account and put in  information , secure information, to get access to the money. They ended up not accepting the gift. I hope that's changed. BTW I am a big fan of circle all the same

Mine and spend bitcoins to understand how it works.  After that you will not want to convert them to usd. You can get an S3 for about $100 on ebay.  100 bits
@_date: 2015-03-20 04:02:05
Very cool site and concept. Congrats! I like to see new applications fill in some of the gaps of bitcoin technology. Honestly, I will not use your services because I like to keep my coins at home and do not have enough to worry about fluctuations. Plus I live in the US with a stable dollar. All the same, there are plenty of places in the world that can benefit here! Keep fighting the good fight

I use to follow potcoin. Do they do something bitcoin does not?

I always tip in cash after the purchase. those guys need to get paid too
@_date: 2016-05-13 23:29:59
I wish there was this option too. Then, I could sell things for fiat and receive btc.
@_date: 2015-02-11 02:41:31
I love your wallet. Would you every add support for litecoin and dogecoin? Just curious
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:11:03
That is great!

I have bought 4 coins from them with dogecoin. They delivery fast and it is IRA approved coins. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 23:49:52
good to see there is someone out there doing it 200 bits @_date: 2015-02-26 18:33:22
I am Not sure. I only bought a few because they were cool. I'm not actually using the IRA program. There is details on their website about it though

You can not use visa or credit/debit cards in weed stores. I live in WA and they do not even have credit card infrastructure. Credit cards and bank cards are federally protected and if used, would shut down the shop as they would be commiting a federal crime. We use hard cash. I have talk to owners about bitcoin before but they are not generally Tech savvy folks. Maybe pokemon go will open their eyes. Lol.

I don't like how I can't  search for catagories, like software. Browsing feels unorganized right now. I lose attention span before I buy. Plus my sales sucks and the prices are too expensive due to the increase in btc price. I need to fix it.but not motivated to do so

I use altcoins (dogecoin and litecoin) for micro transactions. Its cheaper and faster and easily convertible back and forth to btc

I started spend g .u coins and use this service too. It is very helpful. I use first in first out so I am spending coins from 2014 and buying coins today for years down the road. That way it is always long term gains

Greed is a driving force in Bitcoin. If you're looking for a coin that isn't greedy, or as greedy, try Dogecoin. The biggest thing in that space is fundraisers and helping poor people. Plus it's an inflation coin not a deflation coin which changes the greed economics

Yip. Slush and Bitcoin.com are the only pools I could find they don't Litter your wallet with unspent transactions from mining. For example an antminer S7 - Ln will mine just enough to pay out everyday. Unfortunately it's nothing but dust now
