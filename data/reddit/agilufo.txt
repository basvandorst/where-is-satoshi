Scrubs. Everytime.

I'll just wait to see it go higher, go all in and loose them again. Just wait for it.

Sometimes by accident.
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:37:11
Could be. 
Or is just an unregulated market where who came in first commends and we are just at the very beginning of everything.
But yes, it's a drug, and for sure big whales steals our/mine money and a lot of exchanges are corrupted. So be wise and before doing things study first.

Well, I just don't want to be ignorant. I read a few books about this story and I think there is some true under all those piles of lies.

Wright: Prepare for a bitcoin bloodbath
" Wright is embroiled in a $10 billion lawsuit filed against him in 2018 by the estate of deceased computer genius Dave Kleiman. The estate wants half of the 1.1 million bitcoin that Wright and Kleiman allegedly mined together before Dave's 2013 death.
As CCN reported, when Wright first appeared in court on June 28, he told Judge Bruce Reinhart that he couldn’t access the enormous bitcoin trove that he and Kleiman had mined together. Wright claimed this is because the holdings are being held in a blind trust, and he doesn’t have all the requisite keys to access them right now.
However, Wright says the entire 1.1 million in bitcoin “will be returned” to him on January 1, 2020. In his latest blog post, Wright says that in 2020, he'll gain access to his bitcoin holdings and will pay a massive tax bill. "
" After that happens, Wright warns the crypto industry to prepare for a potential bitcoin apocalypse. He suggested that as a bitcoin whale, he might topple the entire market.
"Bitcoin can be seized," Wright warned. "In the coming year, you’re going to learn just how fragile the house of cards that is a criminal system built upon Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency really is." "

Yes I don't think either that he is the true Satoshi, but I really think that he is involved with this shit from a long time and him having access to that sum of Bitcoin is pretty plausible and frightening.

That's a good point.
Me too.

You just close the channel you are in and automatically get your BTC back :)
If you use Eclair wallet this is the message that pops out when you close the channel: 
Unfortunately with Eclair you can't create payment requests, for now.

Lightning, which then you can convert to BTC or use elsewhere
@_date: 2019-02-19 11:00:37
You can tip Twitter users using Lightning Network. You just need to install a browser extension! Really smart.
@_date: 2019-02-19 14:05:54
Woo! Really cool, didn't knew about lntipbot.
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:00:16
You have to start a channel with them. It should be written in the article I think
@_date: 2019-02-19 18:16:08
Yes you have to open it before, you can see how in the article :)
@_date: 2019-02-19 16:46:39
Go to Tippin.me, Login, Click the "cash out" button.
You need to have a payment request (which you can make in lightning network wallets)
@_date: 2018-11-15 18:53:05
It needs a new way to remunerate nodes which doesn't involve money
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:54:42
Very good point. 
But also imagine to arrive to London airport, you need GBP, but you only have Bitcoin, and you have exchanges at the airport. Still cool :D
@_date: 2019-01-21 22:53:05
Ahahahah yeah of course it's photoshopped... But in a few years who knows?!
@_date: 2019-01-22 11:34:05
You know it's not the same thing and not the same impact, right?
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:03:00
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:41:21
Why? How do you write it? (Srly)

Not blaming anyone. Had no job and no money to invest. Life sucks :D
