The name doesn't even say expert in it.
Fake news.

While you're right that your average person doesn't need to worry about the government compromising their computer and spying on them, the real concern here is that the CIA's negligence caused these tools to be leaked into the wild.
Now, who KNOWS who has access to these tools, who knows who's used these tools and altered them, or who's using them to spy on their neighbors kids/wife.  Who's using them to compromise their neighbor who they know is really into bitcoin with the intentions of stealing their funds?
The consequences of this are far greater than what's being realized right now.

The technology to hack vehicles existing, and the technology to hack vehicles being actually sought and used by the CIA, are two VERY different things.
It's one thing to say that it exists or that it's possible, it's another to know that your intelligence community is researching it and KEEPING IT SECRET.  That's the key, these exploits they are aware of , they are PURPOSELY keeping them secret to utilize them.  Why would the CIA ever need to have secret backdoors to hack someones vehicle?  We both know the answer to that, but you can't get people to believe this stuff unless there's actual evidence of it.

You say that, but 6 months ago if someone suggested that the CIA might have killed a journalist or investigator by controlling their car, you'd get a massive eye roll and tin foil hat comments.
As more of this boils up to the main stream, people will realize how plausible so much of the conspiracy shit really is.  Instead of mocking people, help spread it so people actually understand that it's legitimately happening.

I can't stop laughing at the fact that someone made this.

Yeah don't do that. Just ask yourself, will it be worth more or less in a year.  I suspect the answer is more. Worry about it then
