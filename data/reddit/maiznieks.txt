Was wondering why sleeping is so important until i figured its "spelling"

Just make a fork called Bitcoin Legacy. Then BTC can't be called it anymore :D

When you think your feed is flooded in btc posts, this comes up too. Should unsub from few subs until this settles..

I could go on - people that buy bch or btg are enabling trashcoins to become scamcoins :)

Technology is for altcoins. You don't see people making good hammers and nails out of gold, it's stronger and cheaper materials, that are good for the purpose.  You buy gold for the value and pride.
Just in case someone thinks i'm suggesting to keep those copycatcoins, I'm not. There are altcoins and then there are those scumbagcoins that envy the bitcoin and want to take it's place with whatever lie there is. I suggest getting real bitcoin for the value and good altcoins for the tech (payments, purpose, etc).

How much is it to mine those bloks?

Why do I hear a bitconeeeeect scream in my head while looking at this? :)

Are there exchanges with lower fees? That's incredibly high, i was charged approximately 4 € when i bought 20€ worth of BTC and transferred it to bittrax. 
I am afraid how much it's going to cost once I want to take it out. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 12:03:17
I read it and I do understand :)

Well, it does say "free £ cash"

Since when 0 x 1.6 equals 1800?
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:06:22
I did not know that as well before i started building my own Ether rig. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:22:28
How do you choose tx fee? I transferred few coins from bittrex to electron wallet address - it was expensive and i didn't see any option to change priority or rx fees.. Now i am afraid to put it back, because of those crazy fees

Revolut was first.

At least the "rig builders" that don't know which one is the pcie port, will finally shut up. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:42:38
Ye, i have couple of those. Just connect power to first one and let it do it's magic. Wireless! ��

I do understand, but the more i trade, the less coin i end up with. Basically, whenever I buy, it drops like crazy. Whenever I finally sell, it skyrockets. Just my luck. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:38:59
You forget ones; they become zeroes �� all nulled out

The dip
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:02:10
How do you connect in airplane mode? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:15:02
I always buy in the deepest dip and sell at high,that's my strategy.

Ain't there occasional issues with kraken when there are sudden bitcoin rate changes? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:59:44
Is math related to science?

Oh great, his rockets are going to go TO THE MOON!! We're safe!
