Thanks Bob! I'm still figuring out this tipping thing but I appreciate it just the same.  :)

thank you kind stranger!

Not that early - just last year. I'm not too mad about since I was just testing the waters/playing around. It sucks if you look at it from the perspective of projected monies lost but that outlook leads to a dark place.

This.   I have more worry here then for the coins I had in there
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:46:04
that's a better of line of thinking - really.  Keep your head up

when bitfloor crashed I had $50 USD sitting in there that I never got back.  So the lost risk from my POV is probably the same.

I don't think the popcorn hour is about folks suffering but more so about the completely fustercluck that was/is mt gox. As someone who lost coin in there (couldn't get a withdrawal) popcorn is better then tissues.

I believe I'm verified.  I sent my info in a long time ago.

Yes, exactly. All withdrawals are on hold and honestly its not likely withdrawals will come back.  If you have money you dont want to lose, dont risk it.

Hey thanks man! Super awesome of you!

8ball says, outlook not good. I'm in the same boat - had some cash in there last week but wire withdrawal was pending for weeks. I moved the balance to btc caused I figured I was screwed either way. Sorry about your luck brother, hopefully it wasn't too much. Keep your head up.

Thanks mate! You dogecoin folks are super fun and awesome.

so I bought at $117 - its a gamble for sure considering its already down to $110.  The 1k was an initial $200.00 investment.  At the end of it all, I will only 'lose' $200.  However for others if you need that money, do not do this.  It's a very very high gamble.

haha - awesome.  Just logged in and saw my "balance" of BTC.  Maybe alternate universe me is able to cash those out.  I wish her the best.

Thanks mate! So... does this get me drinks on DS9? 
 there are way more cryptocurrencies in the world than I was aware of.
