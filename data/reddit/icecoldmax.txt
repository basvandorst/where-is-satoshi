What else would it be? 1 bitcoin 2 bitcoins. 
I mean you say 1 dollar 2 dollars, but I guess you say 100 yen and not 100 yens.

So what, put them in the bin?? Haha if they’re not in my wallet I forget to spend them and then they accumulate
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:33:12
You could always call them yennies! 100 yennies is 1 Japan Dollar ;)

Well no matter the cost of something you can always use the yennies such that you never have more that 4 in your wallet at once. If you’re not careful and don’t get rid of them they just accumulate until you are awash in 1 yen coins.

Haha yes it’s a constant battle to make sure never to have more than 4 in my wallet at the same time

Super conservative mum and stepfather literally call me up after reading any FUD type news (last one was the bitcoin.com guy saying it was useless) and telling me that my refusal to sell is causing them “great anxiety”. Well, get used to it guys cos HODLing is the name of the game!

Exactly what happened to me! Repaired the broken power supply of an old external drive and found a Time Machine backup with my old wallet containing 2 coins I hive-mined in 2011. What a find! Only wish I’d kept at it longer haha
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:30:49
Oh man I know this feeling. I joined a hive mining thing in 2011, earned 2 coins then gave up and forgot about it. Recently found the old wallet on an old disk and set it all up again. It was like winning the lottery!
