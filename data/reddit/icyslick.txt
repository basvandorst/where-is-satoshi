I think Changetip will change the way we donate as well. So much easier and faster than the other services.

That is great that they are having this. The more exposure the better.

This is my first time with changetip. Trying to get into bitcoin. Seems very promising.

Awesome tool.

I was introduced to Bitcoin awhile ago, but I just started investing in it this past week. I feel like cryptocurrency will be  the future if it already isn't.

I just recently signed up too. It is a great service. So fast.

I just signed onto Changetip as well. I think it is a great service. So easy to set up. Have to tell all my friends.

Changetip is changing the way we tip. Keep spreading the love.

I think private is the way to go in some cases. Continue spreading the love though.

So instead of upvote, you tipvote. Interesting.

Yeah it is great that these tippers are out there. More power to them. I hope it continues raining Bitcoin everywhere. Spread the love.

I think that is great idea. Changetip has been a wonderful addition to Bitcoin.
