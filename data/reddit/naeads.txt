btw, I have a question. This is my first time using bitcoin (dogecoin is my first crypto) and you said using Electrum as wallet. On their webiste, it says I don't need to download the blockchain - does it mean I can just download the wallet and use it right away?

Just news update really, any major changes and such. 
Have been having conversations with friends about bitcoins and such and was quite lost in the conversation despite my previous experience in using bitcoins.

That is still a lot of money! Guess what I have? 0.002 BTC...

No worries! This place looks fun as well compare to - albeit slightly more serious atmosphere. Might stick around :)

That is exactly why China wants stability :P

Doubt China will recognise the new currency. Afterall, stability is China's middle name. They certainly do not want bitcoin to influence the price of YMB in anyway.
