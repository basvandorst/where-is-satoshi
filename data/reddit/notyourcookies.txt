I'm very sorry. I actually read the rules but I didn't see asking, only saw 'begging'. 
Do I need to delete this post? I'll PM the guy who helped me to finish things then.

I received the message! I accepted it, and got a withdraw address. How can I know transfer it to my Electrum wallet (and how can I then get it back from my Electrum wallet to you?)?

Hmm okay I understand now, didn't think about this, new to the world of Bitcoin :) 
Is there any way I can receive like very little BTC. I've seen some 'free bitcoin' sites with surveys and such, but when I try it they either ask too much info or they don't send the Bitcoins at all...

I just tried it but the minimum you can withdraw is $0.20, which is my balance, but I don't have enough for the fee so I can't withdraw it. but I guess it would work, so I'll just send it back using the tipbot?

Yeah okay I could do that but I would prefer to do it with BTC so I can use Electrum because that'll be the client I'll be using. As far as I, know programs like Electrum can't work with Dogecoin.

Oh thanks! I have no idea how the bitcointip bot works, but I guess I will receive a message from the bot telling me what to do? 
I'll send the amount back to you asap!

Ah I might take a look! I came a cross it, but I thought it worked via an online wallet. I could still try though, and then transfer from the online wallet to my Electrum wallet. 
I'll look into it, thanks for helping mate ;)

Well, thank you! I'll send it back asap, just need to know how I can get BTC from my Electum wallet back to the bitcointip bot so I can tip it back to you. You know how I can do this? Do I just send it from Electrum to my deposit address?
Thanks man ;)
And happy holidays!

Thanks a lot, now I can indeed withdraw them finally!
Thanks for helping, if I can do something back just let me know!
