This is high school grade TA. There are way more variables that need to be fed overlayed on top of one another to get a better understanding. Check out funstrat TA data on their website. They consider a host of other variables to make conclusions. 
And i bet even they cannot predict the future. But its definitely better than this garbage.

Wants universal acceptance of bitcoin. Wont pay taxes . 
Dont know which government would let that happen.

Lol.The look on his face is respresentative of every crypto investor currently in the market.

Decentralized future , thats what we should aim for idiots.See the bigger picture. Fuck theseshort terms gains/losses. The future should be in our hands. Think big

Well exactly my point, it aint kansas there.
When a street vendor there can use bitcoin as a store of value/currency for his monthly savings (500 rupees sometimes i.e 7.5$) without loosing 50% the next day thats when it will be really inclusive . Thats the problems that needs to be solved .
The issue is even USD with its infinite adoption and demand fluctuates 6-10% on a monthly basis against the local currency. That person might as well use paypal.China on the other hand is a communist government that will never allow a different currency to dominate,they have spend decades manipulating their currency prices so they can have trade advantages . 
So between the two you literally lost most of the population of earth. FYI, i am from india , i can see ICOs happening as an investment vehicle there.But a one global digital currency! I think thats too futuristic practically. Stable coins might do the trick though but not bitcoin.

S Korea FUD is bs . That exchange had $3mil volume . It shouldnt have effected the price. 
It could be whales exiting because of CFTC investigation

Compare (visa servers+offices) + (banks buildings+bank servers) and then compare it to a BTC transaction. That would be a fair comparision.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:23:25
Technically bitcoin needs no bank to operate it . Whenever people do the calculation on mining energy consumption,they should compare it to how many central bank buildings/servers are required to run a fiat currency. I bet BTC will be greener overall.
@_date: 2018-06-01 20:30:21
What if they close all fiat gateways. Eg: india
No RBI regulated bank is allowed to trade with a crypto exchange

Oh jeez i like crypto to take off but in all seriousness i am from a third world nation living in the states. Most of the developing nations a)dont even have basic internet/phones
b)cant sustain even a few pennies worth of transaction so mostly stick to cash 
c) are so uneducated that they will never understand any other type of money other than phycial/tangible thing that they can put under their bed at night
Even now the cellphone and internet penetration in developing countries is super low or non existant. So yes , in a couple of centuries it will happen, i will probably be dead by then.

Its been a year since ICOs have started launching on etherium . I can understand that there are multiple fake ICO and fraudster but to say that all of them are going to fail is a strech.

Nobel prize winning economist cannot figure out what every idiot on the internet can. Seems right.
@_date: 2018-06-06 02:22:41
Someone write a bot to to google bitcoin a lot
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:45:22
Finally for fuck sake someone had the time to clarify this. Bitcoin without any bank branches controlling it is still more greener than traditional banks.
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:31:16
Oh for fuck sake this was weeks ago and it was paid actors. Some crypto company paid them to stage that for media attention.
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:03:50
Lol. You know crypto is about financial inclusion right? People in the west truly dont care about paypal/bank taking a fee, they will never migrate to crypto. But small/medium businesses in third world countries cannot withstand middle man fees.Not to mention the corruption problem they have, which could potentially be solved using blockchain.The potential in countries like india is massive.
@_date: 2018-07-18 01:45:13
Yeah thats true but bitcoin is a low volume market. If he injects berkshire money its probably going to be in the billions , that will give the market a stroke and cause it to oversell. Even if it triples its current volume, thats not enough liquidity for him to inject his level of capital. 
Plus the custodity is a nightmare currently for instituional investors.
ETF should solve these , hopefully SEC approves it soon.

Because he bets on instruments that will yeald profits in his lifetime. Not moonshot projects that might be successful 10-20 years down the road when he is dead. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:16:28
A fuck ton of people who actually need 0 fee transactions.
