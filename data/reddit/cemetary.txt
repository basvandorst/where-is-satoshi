You are entitled to disagree but don't come here acting like a dick. I appreciate your opinion, and want you to share it, but can we please keep things positive here.

You own any gold, bought anything with it lately? It's more than a currency for spending, it's an investment and a store of wealth. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:13:46
There is a lot of anti bitcoin shills in the sub this week for sure
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:13:24
Don't think so, the market manipulation did all it could and now it's going back up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:45:05
Dipped whilst I was in bed sleeping DAMMIT! I was waiting for it to go down and missed it :/ At least I bought the last 3 decent dips.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:58:21
We have information technology to spur growth and aid in distribution. Gold then vs Bitcoin now can only be a limited comparison. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:09:13
Source is not a source.. Sounds great if it is real..

Your reply isn't based in reality. People operating mining farms have costs such as electricity, cooling, rent, labour etc. These expenses must be paid.
A farm cam operate at a loss for a period of time and use up it's cash reserves, but inevitably there comes a point where they will lose their premises, have power cut off, have employees leave for not being paid etc.

You haven't lost anything mate. These will in almost all likelyhood go up to much higher than what you paid within a year or two.
@_date: 2018-09-11 08:48:26
Consider the mining difficulty at that time vs now ie investment vs return rates. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:06:36
I bought the dip! Riding the train up all the way. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:19:02
It'd be nice if they could wait for my next paycheck so I can also catch that dip :)
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:30:14
Wow that's a fantastic thing to do!
@_date: 2018-09-11 07:06:45
If the value of bitcoin got that low it would crash hard. Miners might switch off equipment.. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:53:27
absolute amateur, I'm disgusted with myself.

Do they work when the site is down? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:04:30
what you talking about? it dropped down about 2-3k in value from when it hit 17500 before. now its back up over 18000.
@_date: 2018-08-27 15:02:53
What'd you make then? 
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:34:45
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:07:13
Why? Bitcoin to people, from an investment point of view, was a great money maker. What is the next bitcoin makes sense in that context. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:08:34
What's up with it? I want to buy too... 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:17:56
wtf is going on right now?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:30:53
It's still down for me and has gone up 1k ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:24:26
I stared at that for hours then thought.. why not try just buying and it worked.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:15:01
Dis big? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:00:14
Ignore the fact it says unavailable and try to purchase, working for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:07:24
I bought a modest amount back at 7300 through coinbase. I'm looking to get a bit more now but it's down. I've also heard of limit buying too and thought I'd like to have some fun with that.
Can someone point me in the right direction. I'm pretty new to this, so super open to feedback. Thanks.

Who has decentralised ID tech currently up and running?
@_date: 2018-03-18 09:02:09
They are also calm because they bought in between 1 and 5000, they sold most of their holdings after December and are dollar cost averaging back in slowly ��
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:41:13
First up nobody believes you have awhale friend with 400mil to spend, but I digress.
We know that the people that largely contributed to the crash have a lot more bitcoin that they could dump at any time. Wise investors should be and are scared of this. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:43:01
Pure speculation with zero facts to back it up. There is ZERO president in a case like this. Would love to see factual information with sources to prove me otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 08:30:35
Super bullish on ICX now! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:54:44
Good on ya mate, what are you mining on? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:10:44
ICX is far superior to bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:43:35
You think so, you don't know so. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 09:10:15
It's not as hard as you think mate. The chemical addiction is gone after a short period. Find something else to do when you drink, you will get fidgety/want to slip the most then.
The key to quitting is wanting to. Don't pretend you want to. Do you want to smell like shit, have dampened taste buds your whole life, watch money dissapear on a meaningless addiction and then most likely die of cancer in horrible pain as a result of it... For what? Nothing.. I watched all my grandparents die of cancer and they were all smokers. I miss them.. I really could have used their help and guidance in my life. Do you want grandchildren one day, do you want to be there for those kids?
Err that got a bit emotional sorry. It means a lot to me that I stopped. Best of luck to you my friend. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:36:49
This should be illegal, is it? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:12:24
You are correct
