Is there a difference between "Bitcoin" and "bitcoin"? The Wiki seems to use both as a proper noun?

Hearn is,
* wary of the hype, especially the ability of Bitcoin to scale or remain fully decentralized
* disappointed by the lack of feature development
* can see little potential for sidechains being implemented due to complexity and Bitcoin dev support.
Everything else stated, other than the Google politics, flows from these viewpoints.
I would say that **without sidechains**, his skeptical views of Bitcoin become a self-fulfilling prophecy!
If a player like Google could be convinced to engage with the Bitcoin dev community to aggressively help create a "plugin" architecture for sidechains into Bitcoin, then without a doubt Bitcoin would have a very strong chance of fulfilling its world changing potential.

What makes a hard fork **non-**contentious?
Related, what is the method of resolving contention to the point where a hard fork would be acceptable and supportable by Bitcoin.org?

There are no "Plans"!
This is literally one guy who also has no power in government since he's just a consultant.
Also, this is Germany. It will be the last place on earth, or at least the developed world, that abolishes cash.

Watch [Inside Job (2010)]( This is probably the best financial documentary you will ever see, certainly on the 2008 Financial Crisis, Subprime Crises and Great Recession.
Larry Summers:
- Secretary of Treasury under Clinton
- one of the chief architects for the deregulation of the US financial system, including the repeal of Glass-Steagell [key provisions of a critical banking act stemming directly from causes of the Great Depression, separating activities of commercial banks from investment/securities firms] and many other attempts to regulate the derivatives markets, a leading factor in the 2007 subprime mortgage and the 2008 financial crises
- has been the subject of ridicule and punitive actions from academics, regulators and institutions alike due to deep conflicts of interest, some financial, some political, many regulatory, etc.
- became a key figure in the White House National Economic Council under Obama after the Crisis
- attempted to become chair of the Federal Reserve and the mere possibility generated such cross-party opposition that he was forced to withdraw as potential nominee
- Summers is often held up as a prime example of revolving door politics leading to "regulatory capture", a form of political corruption that results in public agencies acting against the public interest.

They do have to care since in absolute terms it is their electricity and bandwidth being used for mining. In relative terms, they are also being paid almost nothing for that electricity.

Spot on.
It is not about the BTC. The underlying could be balloons, corn, mortages, whatever.
You as an investor are holding a debt instrument. You can think of it as fiat layered on BTC. Yes, that is as ugly as it sounds.
The actual good news is the fact this is a BTC-related instrument in a **regulated** AND **exchange-traded** environment. That aspect is huge because it instantly opens up to the type of investors who would not previously have been available to BTC. In addition, it can very quickly lead to other types of more direct and liquid instruments, both on and off exchanges (most financial instruments and derivatives are actually not traded on exchange).

I've never been interested in practically using Bitcoin before. But this ... this is something else. The combination of GSM + old tech and new tech is ingenious design! I really hope they do well.
I wonder why they are starting in the developed world first rather than developing world? The need and potential for both growth and absolute customers is much higher in the latter...

Next time make it agnostic.
Print two pieces of paper, one with a large Bitcoin currency symbol, the other with an equally large Dollar currency symbol.
On the back of each have the money (key and note).

Yeah, no. Enough with the kooky economic and conspiracy theories. Public debt to GDP ratio (*) of NL is lower than most developed countries, including all the major ones like the US, UK and Germany. Scandinavian countries are renowned the world over for having very strong yet efficient welfare and social systems.
Just like individuals and businesses, all economic entities, including countries, function using debt. 
This is considered like borrowing from your future earnings. In the particular case of a country with lack of a meaningful lifecycle, unlike individuals or even businesses, such borrowing only needs to be sustainable. For countries, this is about ensuring it can pay the interest on that debt, i.e. avoiding default, and retain confidence from investors about the sustainability of that tax revenue income by having a functioning economy.
If you that desperate to search for unsustainable debt in a developed country, then look to others, e.g. the 200%+ ratio of Japan - an ever rising ratio that has existed for decades...
(*) External public debt is more important, but that's another story.
