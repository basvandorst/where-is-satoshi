Exchanges can be insured..although I will give you, I don't know the state of these exchanges we talk about, I imagine some of them are ... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:16:10
There are like 7 exchanges that see trade in billions of usd valued crypto each day currently.....not the same at all..

Same principal is applied to banks and money and trade in general, whats your point?

What? You mean to tell me that a sub Reddit is not one autonomous mind with one homogeneous opinion about everything? You mean to tell me that its made of of different people with different opinions, worst yet different levels of cognitive ability? Meaning some percentage of any sub Reddit will spew nonsensical asshattery in spades?  
It is as if some people will never understand, that some people will never understand, that they just don't understand.

Yes, I've seen some videos of it, currently just Macgyvered private endeavors. But actually depending on how prevalent peer to peer blockchain economies become and thus the need of computing power to verify it (assuming pow or some simile is the defacto standard). I can see households and business setting up enough heat creating equipment you could possibly radiate it to the floors at the very least possibly more at which point I could envision some commercial add-on products, like the aforementioned radiator/ cooler.

Thoughts on Enjin coin?
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:09:19
Look at EnjinCoin.

He is right the system as we know it would collapse without electricity, fiat money is reliant on electricity as well...You don't think they move actual dollars from your bank account to your bank when you pay the mortgage, do you?

Whats the mining algorithm used by bitcoin and whats the one used by litecoin? Are they different? What about block sizes are they the same or different? Different code is different code sorry bud.  
Are they very similar, yes, was litecoin a clone of btc, yes. Is litecoin code an exact copy of bitcoin, no. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:04:20
You need to learn to handle being wrong like an adult. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:59:12
"You realize literally all of Litecoin's code is a copy of bitcoin's correct?"
That is false.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:02:32
Have they not been developed separately for years now... 
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:48:42
Whatever helps you move on from freaking out about being wrong. Also the urging is for you to deal with being wrong in a more mature manner, not whether you were wrong or not, as of course you were wrong...
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:28:00
You correcting an irrelevant grammatical error while admitting to being semantically and thus actually incorrect  with respect to the crux of our disagreement is the definition of the "red herring" you are accusing me of...you just don't learn. 
Ohh and by the way that's an informal fallacy you probably shouldn't hyperlink it using the word logic, unless you enjoy looking like fool..I have to admit its quite funny to see you trip over it though.  
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:37:58
Face what? I didn't make any false proclamations, you did.  
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:32:03
Shhhhh it's okay, everyone gets it wrong sometimes. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:03:56
Wow you are an angry little man, the code is different end of story, you need too learn to be wrong better.
Further semantics is not some voodoo only assholes use, it's a required part of logic you idiot. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:38:49
You have to understand how stupid you are to understand how stupid you are, not much I can do for you in that respect. Good luck in life.

Changing multiple module parts of the code, is a bit more then swapping titles. You know a coin is more then its blockchain? Right? Further your Iphone reference is garbage in light of the fact the btc code was open purposefully, are you aware of the open source nature of the movement? Does Apple open source its hardware/software?
Plus you might not have said "it was an exact copy" but then again that doesnt change the fact that what you said was wrong despite your sniveling. Clearly you insinuate exact when you use the words "literally all of" in reference to the make of the code. "Exact" or "literally all of" are interchangeable in this context, more importantly both are wrong, face it.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:21:45
Is it actually 98 percent or are you using hyperbole again? You just don't learn do you. 
Also of note, no one argued about the modular nature of the hashing algorithm, I was simply pointing out that your initial comment is factually and actually incorrect. 
Also note I am not some litecoin shill. I own more btc than I do ltc and have far more faith in the larger btc community.  
You were simply wrong in what you said, clam down.

There is currently no hard limit on coins with respect to Ethereum, and QE is as "easy" as a hardfork away for most crypto coins, Bitcoin included. Not to mention any new ICO could implement QE within its coin-a-sphere from the ground up if they chose too.
