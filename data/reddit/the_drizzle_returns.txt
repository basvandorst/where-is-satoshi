To be fair, he was right to not understand it. There literally was no business model for many of the tech companies in the 90's that were worth millions. Hell even today a lot of tech companies business models are based on basically building up users and hitting the exits as fast as possible or trying to work out monetization "as they go".

Some (including myself) would say he did so smartly. If you are a long term investor (which he is) being in Tech/Internet stocks is not a wise move. There is too much volatility and risk in that sector even if you have a very deep understanding of both the technological aspect and the finance/business aspect.

$900K in 19 days of trading in Fee's says otherwise.

Brings up an interesting question, can you actually reproduce the binary kernel (i.e. a one to one, hash identical copy) shipped with popular linux distros from the linux kernel source?  And no, this isn't a trivial "well just compile it yourself and check!" problem, its extremely difficult to reproduce exact replicas of compiled binaries. It took several years for someone to reproduce a single version of TrueCrypt when that was still around. Has someone done this?

Their business model is selling order flow. Robinhood is legitimate but I would not suggest trading crypto through it.

Especially when all of the recoveries have been pretty slow affairs (relatively speaking) with a moderately long period of slow growth followed by a spike. It makes no sense to hold in the downward spiral since its unlikely you will miss some dramatic upside by holding.

They can't for regulatory reasons.

Why? Without them you cannot approach an AD complete market.

Except it was live in the late 70s/80s.... 
In addition the distributed systems/database work that the blockchain is based off of has in fact been in actual production use for 15+ years in distributed databases (some of which, ironically enough, are used by banks to manage transactions internally). 
Which is why this post is non-sense because they already do the following


Because they need replicated consistent state stores that cannot be tampered with.

You do know that the block chain itself is not a "new" invention right? Its an adaptation of distributed systems/distributed database work from the 90s (such as work from Petersen on highly consistent flexible replication).

Futures are a requirement to form a complete market (Arrow-Debreu market). If the price of bitcoin falls because of a more complete market being formed, then the price prior was inefficient and not at an equilibrium forcing buyers to pay an unnecessary premium.
