Then I opened it in Chrome (with no such addons) and it still was shit ... seriously WTF?!

With all due respect and all the pros and cons of the blocksize debate: In case of a somewhat global adoption, let's say just a billion people use bitcoin on a regular basis, competing them for 7tx/s by fees is not a "fantastic problem" but a total gridlock.

I don't see the need to increase the current memory limit of 640KB at all. It is enough for everyone now, and it will be enough for everyone in the future!
Sure, some applications need more RAM, but these are special cases like Desktop Publishing or CAD, which run on special kinds of hardware, not affordable by any regular person anyway.
What? I hear there are some applications called "games" that also need more RAM? Ohhh, thank good, there are solutions for this already, it's called XMS, and EMS. It is cool because it builds ON TOP of the existing system, so no reason to change anything, besides, do you know how much $ 8MB of RAM even costs? I hear around 800$, so this is nothing we will have to adapt anytime soon.

Actually after reading [this]( comment of him, he seems to get it. It doesn't seem to me that he's too stupid to get the pie analogies, just lost it because of overthinking too much... Key is still that new units can only created by subdivision, not by creating additional ones.

As I understand it, that's what pruning does. Technically it works differently than "cutting off" the chain, because you still need to keep track of UTXOs, but it skips all transactions wit spent outputs.

New cars are merely improvements over old cars, no one redesigns a new car from scratch. Forum software is also constantly under development. It's not like someone implemented a forum software in 1996 and there has been no development since then. Sure, you can implement the same all over again, but that seems like a waste.
Besides, the criticism wasn't for reimplementing a forum software, but for how much it seems to cost.

Running a full node is not that hard if you are running a vps or dedicated server. Also a vps is not that expensive as others have mentioned (~10$/month).
So instead of donating I'd rather ask you to run a full node yourself instead. Furthermore, if you rent a vps, you can use it for a lot of other stuff too.

The qr code that you scrambled on your screenshot is your public address, touch it to show a fullscreen qr code with the actual address below it.
If you post that address, I'll send you some bits that will show up in your wallet.
And yeah, I'm aware that this sounds like a possible scam, but look it up in the internet, all bitcoin addresses starting with a "1" are public addresses that may be posted on the internet so other people might send coins to it.

I also hope the next bubble is coming, but since you're new to the game , a word of warning:
I reluctantly bought my first coins during September last year at about 130$. Then during November when it raced towards 1000$ I bought more and more, it was like a rush. Then the big crash came. My average buy price is somewhere around 500. I never sold a coin and I am not too worried, because I really believe in the long term success, but what I am trying to say is: be aware of this and and don't just blindly buy during the price rise, because it will probably come down again, unless you really buy to hodl long term.
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:30:47
Sounds great, I'll definitely stay tuned!

I actually hope that most of the comments are just troll posts. They at least look that way as most of them don't even attempt to provide proper arguments for their claims.
On the contrary though, this reminds me of a friend who is constantly loathing about all these banksters and how they take your many and how unfair all that is, etc. etc. but laughs at me when I tell him about bitcoin. He seriously doesn't get it. The dumb don't even realize there is a (possible) solution when you slap them with it. If they just spared the time to write such sad comments and instead tried to _understand_ the implications of bitcoin, we would already be on the moon ;)
Oh and of course, those who got rich with bitcoins did not get rich because they made a smart decision. They just were lucky, you know ...

IMHO that's not true. When you buy and sell bitcoins within a year, you have to pay taxes according to your personal income tax.
After holding the coins for at least a year, you can sell them tax free.

Exactly! I started buying last year September at about 130$. Of course I often think what would have been if I had just noticed earlier. But then I remind me that I probably would not have invested several thousand dollars at 1$ a coin back then. I rather feel lucky that I am still early on.

Used them once, I wanted to order a pizza at another service when I realized I had no cash and didn't want to put up my credit card data just for a pizza. That's when I remembered that lieferservice.de accepts bitcoin. So I switched to them and it worked like a charm.
@_date: 2014-05-17 13:05:02

While I agree that this is not entrepreneurship as in starting a business, I strongly disagree about the luck factor. Because should bitcoin bring me a little fortune one day, and my friends call the 'luck' card, I'll remind them of how they called me lunatic back then because of it. How they said it has no intrinsic value, etc. Because investing in it despite all the initial negativity has nothing to do with luck, but with a thorough reward/risk analysis, which depends on a thorough understanding of the technology and its possible implications.

It was just an example, I am not involved in kernel development, but kernel.org would be a good start. As I understand it Linus still manages the mainline kernel and finally decides what gets in.
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:19:13
How about a practical example:
Open up a website where you can buy a small item and pay with creditcard. Now ask the audience who owns a creditcard and then who would be willing to put in their creditcard details in front of the audience, all being displayed on the beamer in order to make the purchase. Probably no one will, this is a bit of a sensitive information leak right?
Now do same with bitcoin and make the purchase in front of the audience. No problem because no sensitive information necessary, which therefore also can't be stolen. Maybe that will ring some bells.

Not trying to troll here, I haven't donated, so I don't really care, but I am curious. I hear about 300k are pumped into making a new forum software. My question is: WHY?!
I mean, first of all, what is wrong with the current forum? I mean it's just a forum, isnt it? Why does anyone even have to reinvent the wheel for this? What kind of improvements are expected to be done? 
And 300k a month (if that is true), seriously? This sounds more like funding a startup to code some very special forum software that will change the internet as we know it forever. I mean, come on, 300k a month for some php, python, whatever coders to code a forum software?!?
Looking for a custom Wordpress plugin? I'll do it for 100k/month!

On the plus side, when asked how secure bitcoin is, you can always say it is *at least* as secure as any other existing system.
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:19:33
Actually, I think the comparison is difficult, because we have rather different methods of security. I could argue that bitcoin is safe as long as the human does not make an error. Then you could argue that under this condition the current banking system is even better because it makes up for human errors (at a price). But it also allows for direct stealing of funds from the people (see cyprus), which is something you cannot do with bitcoin.
After all it's just marketing ;)

When I started in September 2013, I did some heavy trading (no alts, only btc) too at first. That was when the last bubble started. The sad thing is: Even though most of my trades were positive, just holding would have been even better. Thats when I realized some months later, not only does that trading make my tax report much more of a hassle, it was not even worth it. Since then I only buy a few more bitcoins every months and just put them into cold storage for long term holding.

Merchant acceptance *is* consumer incentive. I hold bitcoins and I would love to use them much more, but right now it is still rather difficult to spend a lot of them, ohhh [gog]( when will you finally accept it?!
I bought some stuff online with bitcoins, which worked like a charm by the way .... no more fiddling my creditcard out of my wallet to type in the numbers, etc.
That said, I am pleased to see the steady increase in merchant adaption, with microsoft as the very recent prominent example.

Even if your intentions are good, if you make people post their private keys online it's bad, very bad. If you don't get how people see this as a scam then you should reflect about what you're doing.
Anyway, if you really have good intentions, then provide a sorted list of your table, so users can look the keys up instead of entering them.

Then we agree that the amount spent for a new forum seems a bit .... out of proportion.
I don't know about mastercoin in particular, but VC funding of a startup is a totally different story. Usually your startup is in a race, competing with other startups to be the first on the market. In order to achieve this, the VC firms throw capital at you, simple as that.
The bitcoin forum, on the other hand, is in no particular race with a competitor and there is no need for inventing a whole new technology.

Exactly and I totally agree with the threadstarter. The problem with the community is, it often is too slow and disorganized to counter lobbyists. This is a very crucial phase and the situation reminds me a bit of the pirate party here in germany, which rapidly gained some success and now is pretty much done because all they do is argue with themselves over often ridiculous stuff.
While I think further development etc. should stay community driven, I think we really need some sort of organization specifically to counter destructive lobbying efforts.
The bitcoin opponents will not stop to say this is drug money and how it's a scam or ponzi scheme. We know this is ridiculous, but the average joe doesn't know and their tactic is to keep throwing shit until we get tired to counter their efforts and then they won. Now many will say that they won't get tired, etc. but I've seen it happen often enough. Just posting in a forum or tweeting isn't enough. We need professional lobbyists doing this fulltime.

First of all, github is not git. It is just a rather nice webapp build on top of it. However, everybody can install git on his machine and clone another repository. This creates a full copy of the source repository including all branches. Now you can locally create your own feature branch and make commits to it. You can push these changes back to the github repository or any other clone of it. For example the kernel devs all have their own git repo of the kernel on which they work on features, which are then merged back to the main kernel repo.
In short: you want backups of a git repo? fine just clone it to different machines and that's pretty much it.

I'm far from being a tax laywer or similar and this topic is rather confusing for me, but as I understand it you got it wrong.
You're saying:
"All I get from Frank Schaeffler's site and other sources is that it will be classified as an asset for the first year of holding, qualifying for the flat rate tax of 25% and will be a "private good" afterwards."
That's not what I get from Frank Schaeffler's request. The answer to his request states that bitcoins are _not_ taxed with 25% (Abgeltungssteuer), in contrast to other assets as stocks, etc.) but are _instead_ treated as a "private good" that is taxed  according to § 23 Abs. 1 Nr. 2 EStG, which means you have to pay income tax when selling it within the first year, but no tax at all if you hold it for more than a year.

Ohhhhhh I disagree. Bitcoin being open source is not only of high significance but essential. Imagine bitcoin was closed source.

What makes a hardfork "legitimate"?
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:31:12
You seem to not grasp my analogy, so let me explain:    
*Now* the price for oil is still cheap, however when demand will exceed availability, the price will go up, presumably exponentially so. This is basic economics. Therefore it is crucial to take this into account *now* in order to hopefully have some sort of solution ready when the reserves deplete.
For Bitcoin it is similar. You're saying fees are only about 0.5% of miners income. Maybe so *now*, but the coinbase reward will vanish in future, we *know* this, so fees will eventually make up 100% of miners income. If the size of a block is still 1MB then, the fees will either have to go up dramatically in order to accommodate the miners, or blockchain security will go down dramatically. And even an astronomically high fee does not guarantee your transaction gets processed, because the backlog will be astronomically as well.

Don't worry, it will. Sure, the fee of $100 per transaction may seem a bit high at first, but that's how it s in a free fee market competing around a scarce resource.

My thoughts exactly
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:14:08
So how do you reliably measure the majority?
@_date: 2015-08-14 21:39:51
1.) What bugs me about this one is that people tend to think that change is bad (because it could break something), so not changing anything is good (staying on the safe side, because it already prooved itself for 6 years).    
IMHO the reasoning is flawed, because while I agree with simulating possible scenarios for testing and therefore risk reduction, basically no simulations have been provided about what happens when mainstream adoption takes place but we leave the code as is.    
IMO it is just lazy, pointing fingers to the ones trying to accomodate for future risks, while at the same time ignoring the fact that context is changing.
2.) I totally agree that, besides XT, a *pure* Bitcoin Core implementation with only the bigger blocks patch should be provided.
3.) Pure speculation, so not constructive. If the answer isn't satisfying, please imagine random rant about blockstream developers having own agenda.

@_date: 2015-08-16 11:56:43
I know what he was referring to, but with bitcoin you give the choice to miners and node operators, a.k.a the affected ones. Of course pure *users* will be implicitly affected as well, however since those users don't operate a full validating node anyway, it shouldn't matter to them whether blocks are small or big.
That's why IMHO this analogy doesn't fit. Also, what makes it so sure that choosing bigger blocks corresponds to dropping the bomb? It could very well be the other way round.

And? 0 BTC times X is still 0 in a couple of years. So the reward is the fees only, which will be quite high with a 1MB block size limit, because 1MB can just take so many transactions.


I don't, but either the demand rises or not.     
If it doesn't, the whole blocksize "debate" is for the shitter anyways, because it just doesn't matter.
If it does, blocksize does matter, because of the fees per block (and the transaction backlog).
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:31:46
The halving does not end in 2016. The reasoning for introducing larger blocks (i.e. *hardfork*) rather sooner than later is that it the risk increases with adoption.

Every node must still be able to measure time in order adjust the difficulty. Blocks taking about 10 minutes to be computed is a result of the (adjusted) difficulty which is determined by measuring the time previous blocks took to be computed.
