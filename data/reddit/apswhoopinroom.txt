That's a pretty damn big "if" though

That doesn't benefit the consumer though. If your credit card gets ripped off, you report that shit and you're fine

Most transactions are related to the darknet

Hook me up with your dealer, bud. I want what you're smoking!

Also, you realize that you can check your balance for just about any bank online, right? And you realize that if you can't make it to one of your bank's ATMs, you can just go to a grocery store and get cash back with your groceries, right? There's no fee to get cash back

Oh, I'm the shill? Are you aware what sub we're on right now? If anyone in this conversation is a shill, it's you

Except that the fees to transfer bitcoin are even more exorbitant than credit cards, and the transfer times are far longer too. Right now, Bitcoin is a far inferior product when it comes to being used as a currency.

But you can use it, and your money will be worth relatively the same each day. With bitcoin, you never know what your holdings will be worth the next day. For a currency, it sure acts a hell of a lot like a commodity. Bitcoin won't be ideal for anyone who values security and consistency

That's only if you're an idiot using an ATM that doesn't belong to your bank. If you go to your bank's ATM, withdrawing and checking your balance are both free

You must not realize what the overwhelming majority of bitcoin purchases are for. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:02:55
47% of Bitcoin transactions involve darknet activities. Easily the largest demographic for bitcoin transactions

Except cash is nowhere near as volatile as Bitcoin. If you were to transfer 1 BTC overseas (assuming you're actually transferring the coin and not just giving them the seed to a wallet), by the time the Bitcoin gets there, the other person could have effectively lost hundreds of dollars. If you use cash or wire transfer, that money is going to still be worth essentially the same amount as when you sent it.
Right now I just can't see how Bitcoin would ever be more stable than a stock market, and stock markets are already pretty volatile compared to cash

So living in an area with numerous bank ATMs is a shitty area, but the backwoods places where there aren't ATMs are just fine? Hmmm


Nobody outside of this sub and bitcoin advocates believe that. Let's just say there is a reason that so many people have pulled out. To them, it was a commodity rather than a currency, and there's a reason for that.

How do you know that a better cryptocurrency won't arise and outcompete Bitcoin? I think Bitcoin was a great idea to get the crypto ball rolling, but there is a lot of refining and improving that can be done, and bitcoin will always be handcuffed as far as improvements go.

But you can purchase it with cash, and cash has relatively the same value every day (unless you're in some sort of inflation crisis)

Most people aren't Venezuelan or using Venezuelan currency.

Then why have there been no improvements to make it more anonymous? If they don't make any improvements in that area, Bitcoin will die

Is this why transfers are taking an eternity lately? I had one take over 12 hours when it normally takes 45-90 min

His first fiscal year just started, give it a bit of time

Of course not, but if he starts doing things that cause future business outlook to look bad, or gets impeached, or does something that incites panic, the stock market could take a hit
