those type of generic addresses are usually overloaded and managed in a towerdefense-like way. the stuff sent there hardly gets trough to anybody who can decide.

it is certainly not illegal, but normal vat should be probably paid as usual, at the point of conversion

tweet them, they already got a few nice ones in the last hours
this time the request is public, so it's "louder". if enough potential customers say that they care, it will make no sense to ignore it.

not a tweet, but a support ticket response.
would you like a screenshot?:)

good huh?

sorry if it was confusing.
so if they are also "considering", the intention is there somewhere. it is getting really easy to do now via bitpay etc. so they just need the trigger = hear from enought people at once, that 'ok srsly, take my bitcoins now plz'.
