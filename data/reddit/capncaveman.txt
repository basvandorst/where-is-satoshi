Here's my shitty, and probably unpopular, opinion:
A handful of alts WILL be useful, but almost all of them won't die off UNTIL liquidity in BTC trading gets into the hundreds of billions in volume per day. How does that happen? Major institutions start trading on spot exchanges (that don't exist yet) and non-institutional whales won't be able to leverage giant bags of shit coins to increase their BTC bags. Until such time, that is the function of alts: they are a means to squeeze more BTC out of the greater fool.

This looks like a Corinthians home match. I’ve seen ads like this during their games before.

In all honesty, this is the only way the market will return to being prosperous. Too many have gotten involved to scam, thieve, and gamble on btc and crypto in general. Once the people who never gave a shit in the first place are gone long enough, we will get our chance to buy in at reasonable prices and prosper for when the technologies actually start disrupting industries. 
TL;DR 
The band wagoners need to vacate the space so we can buy in at lows and wait for the next macro cycle.

That’s based on the presumption of purchasing during the highs of last year. If he/she bought or mined prior, they are way up IF they chose to liquidate any of their position.

What you’re saying is self-contradictory. I’m stating that getting excited about volume is what an inexperienced person would do. And it doesn’t just take balls, it takes an unreasonable amount of patience and stoicism if you’re trying to trade short-term for profit. If you’re in it for the long haul, just dollar cost average routinely and stop giving a fuck about the price.

You overestimate the assistance a lawyer can provide in this matter.

Don’t catch the fever, you’ll get burned. A little more patience now won’t kill you.

Maybe, maybe not. I’m not familiar with Maltese law, but I’d bet that the terms of service policies of Binance are heavily weighted in protecting them from being raided by authorities. 
I would petition social media where CZ could see the concern instead of on here. He seems to care about Binance’s image, and any effort on his part would only bolster the public’s perception of Binance as a man ethical, secure and well managed exchange.

You’re making lots of assumptions about the behavior of miners. I won’t stop mining, and I don’t think most will, either.

You nailed it. Pathological weakness.

I'm saying the hash rate is unlikely to drop, not questioning the mechanics which mitigate block time.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:17:13
Yes, but that perception is not wrong. IIRC the worldwide average production cost of one BTC is about 6k. If we fall below production cost, it would help reset the market cycle by shaking out the excess supply and put a lot of people into position to accumulate on the cheap. All I'm saying is that if we fall below the Feb lows, be prepared to buy.

Upvote everything in an echo chamber? There needs to be overlap with outside influences to move beyond the typical subscriber to this sub.

Mischaracterizations and casting aspersions are disingenuous methods meant to silence opposing viewpoints. I’m not a victim, you’re an asshole.

Reading through someone’s post history to craft a straw man with which to poison the well and attempt to ostracize someone is nothing short of censorious.

Can confirm.
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:14:02
Let’s break you out of cognitive dissonance. I’m appealing for the opposite, where you have to tangle with peoples thoughts and ideas rather than finding scurrilous “reasons” to dismiss them and lobotomize yourself in the process.

Omg, I figured it out! They dumped tons of profits into bitcoin then INTENTIONALLY CRASHED THE MARKET so they could write off “losses”. This was a giant tax dodging scheme.
