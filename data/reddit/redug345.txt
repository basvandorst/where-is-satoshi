I probably should have included the edit in the first edition of the previous post, but you can read my argument for why this method of pushing bitcoin as an investment opportunity as a means of achieving adoption actually makes this end goal more difficult through price distortion above.

If this happened with the dollar or euro, significant economic instability would occur.
If you're wondering why so many people view Bitcoin as an investment vehicle and not a currency, it's at least in part because of justifications like this.

In order for it to become a currency it would be beneficial for it to have a more stable value.
People think of dollars or euros in terms of dollars or euros, people also think of bitcoin in terms of dollars or euros, because it fluctuates in price far too much to think of it in terms of bitcoin. 
The implication being of course, that if you buy a product with bitcoin, you still evaluate price in terms of a stable benchmark. Meaning the primary drives of bitcoins value come from 
A) People viewing it as investment that will become more valuable (in terms of dollars or euros)
or 
B) A useful medium of exchange for when dollars or euros are less than ideal mediums.
B is where if bitcoin wants to become primarily a medium of exchange it ought to focus its attention, the heavy emphasis on A distorts prices. With widespread utilization, the aggregate demand for bitcoin for operation B would after an adjustment period leave us with a relatively stable price, and people could begin to think of bitcoin in terms of bitcoin. 
However, the transaction price distortion caused by A (among other sources) as well as the distortion caused by the fact that the supply of bitcoin is a market in and of itself, complicates achieving stability, and furthermore scares off people from utilizing bitcoin which again, makes this take longer, and the accuracy of the information regarding its value as a means of transaction conveyed by its current price becomes yet further distorted.

I'm not totally convinced the demand for B at close to equilibrium results in something valued any higher than it is now, in fact I think it's likely lower and most of the current price drive is from A.
This is speculation however, I fully acknowledge that.

What the fuck do you think investors eventually do with their investments? Maybe apples are a different scenario due to them being perishable, but BTC is apples to well, BTC in this comparison.
