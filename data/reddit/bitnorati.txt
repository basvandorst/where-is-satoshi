Brilliant Idea!

Tell me about it. I know! It might actually launch sooner. I saw that app, looks good, but are you making an IOS version?

Here's what I got so far...
1.	Bitcoin is a 100% digital, decentralized currency system
2.	Decentralized in that there’s no issuing authority, like a central bank. This shields it from most political and/or institutional manipulation or control- control which we’ve seen (historically) quite damaging to people, society, and economies worldwide!
3.	Restricted and limited supply – Only 21 million coins will ever be produced
4.	I call Bitcoin “open source money” because it shares resemblance to other very successful open source software projects like Linux, Wordpress, and Wikipedia. It’s what “money” should look like in a purely digital, social, mobile world.
5.	Coins are brought into circulation through virtual mining using specialized computers configured to solve mathematical puzzles. Blocks of Bitcoins are rewarded to the operators of these computers whose mining efforts actually serve to strengthen and stabilize the entire Bitcoin network.
6.	People around the world can trade dollars (USD) or other currencies for Bitcoins (BTC) using sites like MtGox.com or Coinbase.com and purchase goods and pay for services at a rapidly growing number of online and offline merchants.
7.	My new website  will highlight some of the top people and businesses involved in the Bitcoin economy and provide a useful directory for people to educate themselves about this fascinating new technological advancement.
8.	Bitcoin shares resemblance cash in that they can be used to buy things anonymously
9.	Bitcoin shares resemblance gold in that their supply is finite and increasingly difficult to obtain or “mine”, and trusted as a storage of value or investment
To answer the bubble question everyone is seeing in the media today...
Bitcoin as an open source software project that is decentralized and somewhat mission-based. The price fluctuation is going to boom and bust many times over the next decade. Bubbles are based on people just trying to get rich quick and make money, that's why they burst. Bitcoin is fundamentally different in that its more of a movement, it's creator and early adopters although partially motivated by financial gain truly want to change the world and fix a broken global financial system that is responsible for so many problems like poverty, inequality, war, corruption, etc. in 2001 many people called the internet a bubble, and it was to some, but then Google and Facebook and many other internet companies emerged after this so-called bubble and the internet is far bigger and more widely adopted today than in 2001. Call the internet a bubble, but did it not change the world? Is it not ubiquitous today? Bitcoin will be the same!

Absolutely. I'll keep you posted!

Possibly in the future, but the site will be responsive when launched so it looks decent on mobile without an app for now.

Pseudo names will be allowed (and encouraged)! ;-)

Decided to change the name to bitcorati instead of bitnorati (made more sense) As Technorati is a blend of the words technology and literati, which invokes the notion of technological intelligence or intellectualism, Bitcorati is a blend of the words bitcoin and literati to represent bitcoin intelligence or intellectualism. Will also be switching to new reddit account at

Gotcha, makes sense. Actually, I just taked to my partner and it looks like we'll probably launch in a week to 10 days.

Absolutely. The merchants ARE the real bitcoin stars...and the key influencers striving to increase bitcoin legitimacy in the public eye, as well as the early adopters and pioneers who did things like spend 10,000 btc on two pizzas just to get this whole thing started! That's why I'm launching  next week! A who's who in the bitcoin world... Let me know if you want your business or blog listed! It will be a free directory with premium listing options.
