Yeah... true... but who is going to mow the lawn?
On a side note.. humans are a product of our environment.  The US created an environment of dumbass consumerism starting heavily in 1969.
If that much devolution can happen in one life time... we can for sure undo the damage in a lifetime.
Humans have the capacity to love, grow, and be of sound principle and intelligence..  we have to change the environment.
Your citadel could be such an environment.

This is a dip.. This is a sale.  This maybe the start of a fire sale.  9.5 support is weak.. 9.1 is next.. then 8.. then 7.4.  That's how it will go unless bulls do something about it.  Honestly though,  I think there's quite a bit of people that want to push the price as low as possible ahead of the BAKKT futures contracts launch.  Now is the time to look at BTC and start planning an entrance, yes.

Technically it was up before US markets opened... HOWEVER, futures and implied opens were out so everyone knew it was going red.
That being said, more and more of this inverse correlation is going to further establish BTC as a hedge and "safe haven" asset.  This is going to be more and more important as the legacy cookie begins to crumble.  Slow to start.. then all at once.  Fill up your O2 tanks.. we going to the moon.

Absolutely.  The current market cap of BTC is but a drop in the pond compared to other legacy asset classes.

The contracts are BTC futures contracts (daily and monthly) that enter and settle in BTC.  There is a possible thought here that the whales grab short futures, drive the BTC price down (futures pay out cause they were right) then push price up on the right side of new long futures positions.  All that to say, short term dump may be in the cards.  End game I think were going up... after all since they are playing with BTC.. they want the underlying asset (BTC) to appreciate!
