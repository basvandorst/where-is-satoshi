You can buy from Paxful.com or a similar site. Although I haven't tried with another site only with Pax. it is one of the safe places to buy as they use an escrow and have 24/7 support.

Better to trade with an escrow such as Paxful and the likes. Never ever trade without an escrow to avoid being scammed. Pax don't hold any transactions at all based on my experience. Wish you luck with them.

Yes, It is worth to trade with Paxful. Just giving you some tips when doing your trades.
1. Trade only with traders that have + reviews/feedback.
2. Make sure that they are online (look for the green dot in their username) which means they are online and can trade with you on the spot.
3. If only in case you encountered a problem with the trader, Report it immediately to Paxful Customer Support
