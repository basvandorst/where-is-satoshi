Tried to ‘Time the market’ and ‘take some profit’ ... it’s a gamble to sell some at 5800 and if it corrects back to 4800 now you have an extra +20% more BTC ... too risky cause if it jumps to 6800 you lose 15% BTC ... long term it’s a suckers bet

Learned really REALLY quickly I suck at trading ... lost about .08BTC buying back in at 5800 after the mini dip... sucked it up and ate the loss ... don’t let ego get in the way this is a long road etc etc

Here’s what people with these predictions don’t tell you: it’s not about dollar amounts it’s about purchase power. In 10 years 250k might be rent in Manhattan or a new non luxury mid sized car... wealth is measured by purchase power 
To answer your question in today’s terms ..I’d put BTC at about 750k in today’s dollars.. in 40 years if it is who we think it is then 5-10 million in today’s dollars easily ... if things don’t change there may easily only be 5-7.5M BTC existing in 40 years
Edit: these 250k and 10M perditions are all **conservative** IF we see BTC survive and dominate to become both the default store of wealth AND default currency... that would be the REAL miracle

beg your pardon .. I was addressing 750k value in 10 years using todays purchase power of a USD.. today I think it is worth 13k but I think the bubble will push us close to 6 figures this cycle
I think it is digital gold.. but yet better than gold in almost every way.. oddly enough people will want in when it is 100k moving 2-3% a week similar to the DOW JONES.. they rather not speculate even if they pay that premium just imo
