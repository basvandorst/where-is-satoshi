I can't sell because my SSN can't verify. I have a ticket with a 3 day window.
I have pending ach, i think i'm just going to say fook it and pull the money.
Not even about the win/loss at this point but for the record I was up massive. i don't give fook if asia runs it to 3000 by monday I'm done.

litecoin is best suited to fulfill the needs of 3rd world people, according to my professional analysis.

look at the chart. chinese play bitcoin just like baccarat. they see a streak they follow the streak.
japanese and koreas are wired for tech, but they still are asian and will follow the chart.
chart is back pointing up as of 2am est. will see 2700 by 9am. 
NEVER LOSE

applied may 29 for gemini.
applied may 26 for kraken.
haven't heard a thing from either one, tho I did email gemini support and a human did respond saying they are working on it.
I hope the sec doesn't approve the etf. these exchanges are a joke imo.
