`coinb.in` is a tool.  It is written in javascript.  I notice lots of bad reactions because it runs in a browser. (e.g. "*Omg this website coinb.in is incredibly irresponsible.*" in thread below).  Would it get more respect if it was written in python?  I agree the testnet support is lacking, there is a [PR]( waiting to address this.  u/Outcast3k

Here's a good article which explains all the details.

The redeem script is necessary, I would highly recommend storing it.  Yes, as you say, it can be regenerated with the same parameters, assuming you use the same software and it has not changed the script format in x years time.  I have seen more than one way of coding a timelock script, so for certainty's sake it is better to store it for long-term HODLs.

I've contributed code to the coinbin github.  Also tried out timelocks quite a bit.  The easiest way to try it out is to use **testnet** bitcoin.  You can obtain it [here](  Happy to answer any questions.

Inspired by your suggestion, I made a PR for adding bech32 format addresses to bitcoin-tool.  There's still a lot more that could be done to add SegWit, but perhaps this is a first step.

I timelock my own real-life funds, but I use shorter lockup periods.  So I started out with a series of monthly lock-ups, rolling them into the next account when the timelock expired.  Next I will increase the lock period to 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.  This is just to get comfortable with the process.  As others have said, 10 years may be risky, rolling 1-year lockups may be an alternative.

I find your posts very thought-provoking.  Would love to hear you debate with a podcaster like u/stephanlivera.

The public key is extracted from the signature.  The bitcoin signature includes an extra byte of information (recId) to determine the key from four possibilities.

Yes, you can sign and others can verify an unspent/unused address.  I am referring to the Sign/Verify message feature in Bitcoin core and Electrum.  The signature + hashed message contains enough information to provide the public key which is then verified against the address.
