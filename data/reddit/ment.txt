If I see another "MJ-eating-popcorn" or "dis-gon-b-gud" post I think I'll rage quit r/bitcoin.

I honestly don't know why people are buying right now. The price is back to where it was a few days ago despite the situation with Gox being far worse. One of the biggest exchanges dies and millions of dollars are lost - probably the worst news to hit bitcoin yet... but all we get is a quick dip into the $400's and we're back on our way? Seems a bit irrational to me.

They are smug because they outright dismiss it. It's a scam, a ponzi, something only an idiot would take interest in. And they *know* they are right. I never said "everyone else is wrong and bitcoin is right". There are genuine concerns and criticisms. I'm well aware of the many issues bitcoin currently faces. But most of the time I'm hearing the same old irrational arguments over and over. I also wouldn't call bitcoin "valueless" - it's a revolutionary technology, who can say what a fair price is? But I agree, there is much work to be done before it can become mainstream. As for the mania - this can be found anywhere there is potential for easy money to be made. The same people can be found in the stock market, just browse through some of the yahoo finance message boards. Yet nobody is screaming tulip mania there.

When it's coming from Gox, "Thursday at the latest" has a different meaning from how the phrase would commonly be understood.

When asked if the "leaked" document was correct:
"Yes. Unfortunately a lot of what's in the document coincides with the information that I had already known over the past few days."

The constant comparison to tulips is extremely irritating and puzzling. They aren't even vaguely similar. Properties of good money - divisibility, durability, scarcity, fungibility... tulips score poorly on all these things. Bitcoin does not. It's completely different. I don't care if people think bitcoin will fail or that it's a bad "investment". What annoys me is sheer smugness and complacency of these people, despite the unwillingness to learn about the very thing they are criticizing.

The "next bubble" everyone was waiting for didn't come. Impatient people and non-believers are cashing out.

I now get an email confirmation every time I log in. Is this the case for anyone else?

Dare I say the *sheep* were *fleeced*?

I've become desensitized :(
