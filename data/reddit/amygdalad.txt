How is market cap irrelevant? Money is not infinite, it's not realistic for bitcoin to exceed the market cap of all money in existence

Too be fair the crypto market nearly hit 1 Trillion market cap in January 2018

This really only makes sense from an extreme libertarian view point where fiat no longer exists

While I agree with you, the reason I invested in bitcoin a couple weeks back was because it was proving to be a strong asset after weathering a great collapse, on top of that many companies are using blockchain in their business models, IBM, Walmart, Starbucks, JP Morgan.  Bitcoin will always be the grandfather of blockchain.  That alone is good reason for speculative "investment".  I make 6% interest a year just holding bitcoin, and that alone can qualify it as an investment vs a speculation.

Usually you can get more return from investment (8% hopefully) so to me it's never worth paying off loans
