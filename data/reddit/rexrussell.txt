Even if you bought BTC in the past. As soon as you moved them it would creat a quantum fork in the block chain. You would split off in to a completely reality. It would be like the squish a bug in the past Change the future. Come to think of it using the block chain to keep track of separate reality and block time stamps would be a great way to keep track of time travel points.

If you have been using robin hood. Look in to the Cash app from square. Its got a debit card tied to it. You can use BTC as your savings account and just move it to your card if you wish to spend it.

Don't servers cost money and buy and run? Imagine if you could run a client on your PC. Insted of mining your hosting a game or making your system available to other players like a torrent node. When your "offline" or not playing you will earn tokens that can be redeemed for play time or in-game credits. Something like the steam proof of stake gaming app.

If you add the token and your holdings you can click on you individual and see your holdings with dollar cost and your proft. Just click on the amount in the correct and it will change from percent to dollar or dollar cost/BTC value.

Sell it to your friends. Give away $5 to any one who's willing to open a wallet. Offer to pay your half of the tab at the bar or for lunch. Share a the experience. I've met people that I paid them $20 at a bar years later thanking me cause those couple of beers and a conversation gave them a whole new game to play in life, that has increased their quality of life and out look.

Quote of the day

You it's kinda like some one takes a book. Like Harry Potter. Then just starts adding extra chapters to it at the end of the book. Names it something else like Harry Potter 2x. Then trys to convince people that's it's a better book. To get you to buy in to it.

Imagine  the great vacuum of wealth that sucks from the stock market and enters the crypto Market. We live in interesting times. Were company's struggle to play catch up launching all their own crypto based stocks in the new economy.

I would disagree, every cent counts. Every stone Carry's some weight. One day a single stone will be enough to tip the scales in another direction.

The app looks great but I can't find a single teller.

I too have been caught up in this also. I transferred 500 4 days ago to btc address. The support has been telling me they are aware of the issue and is working to fund the transaction in 24 hours. I have not had any valid response from them. I'm very frustrated right now. 
How many other people out there are also affected. Does any one know what is "technical Delay" is.

I agree that i love when the price surges up wards but it makes me want to hold all my coins. since the price has stable all week i have been more willing to spend a few on some real good and services. Its easy to simply exchange fiat the same day and still keep my BTC wallet at a comfortable Balance.
