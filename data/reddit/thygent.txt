Laws can always be put a side, especially related to economic trades, you could set up a company in a country with no regulations, and as the transactions would be virtual and untraceable it wouldn't matter where the investors are. Say you set up you trading company in Hong Kong, people from all over the world would be able to trade through your platform as long as there are no restrictions in the country where you are set up.
Just let me know if you want to try and set it up

Having thought about it there could be one way to seduce investors, that would be possible arbitrage opportunity, I won't go into all the detail of what arbitrage is but lets say the price for gold today is $1700, however you can buy it for B150 (assuming an exchange rate of 1B for $10 to keep it simple) he could then buy that gold in bitcoins and sell it for dollars (work for futures, forwards, stocks...) and make $200 profit. If you could create such opportunities you would find a way to interest investors regardless of the bitcoin "risk"

I agree finding companies or people willing to trade commodities in bitcoins will be hard to find. As a currency bitcoin is not believed to be reliable, and in this area what people think is more important than what is true. So a first step would be to convince people that Bitcoin is a strong currency, and seeing how most governments are opposed to it it will not be easy.

I may be writing a paper on the internet financial markets for my MSc dissertation and would be very interested in what you may find, and will share whatever I will find. Unfortunately I have not found much yet. However I have to be honest I do think putting into place such a system is likely to be highly complicated and long, although it would be worth it. If you were willing to set it up yourself, I would be able to help

As long as whoever bought $1m worth of Bitcoin doesn't decide to withdraw it in a few days, all will be fine. Otherwise we will witness a huge crash in Bitcoin value.

Well you see I hadn't thought about the legal side of it which is why I posted it here so I could have different points of views, I'm not based in the US but to be honest if I were to start something like that I would target the US market as it is where the largest quantity of Bitcoin traders are.
As for being far away from having a viable bitcoin market, I was thinking that putting something into place before people need it, and as soon as they need it we would have something ready for them to use immediately.

There are no major benefits, except for the benefits that come with Bitcoin. It would just offer an alternative to real currency trading.

It is true that it is hard to determine whether  this is a bubble or not. The answer to the question is yes and no.
It isn't a bubble in the sense that it is simple supply and demand economics, more and more people and businesses are starting to use Bitcoin, and people are becoming more and more aware of it, thus raising the demand for Bitcoins. This leads to an increase in price, which is what we have seen in the past few months.
But it is a bubble in the sense that people are scared that the currency will crash, so people are holding back from buying and some are even selling. This is the worse they could do for the currency, if some people start getting scared and start selling, and others follow this will lead to a crash in prices, which is not good for anyone.
So far today we have on average seen a stability in the prices, with certain positive and negative peaks. However the biggest threat to the currency is it's people, if people decide to stop buying (which we are starting to see) it will crash, but if people decide to start buying again no matter the price, then it will keep rinsing. But keep in mind the increase in price will not last forever and will one day stabilise, so until then do your best to make some money.
tl;dr: If you stop buying and start selling it will crash, otherwise no problem.

I was wandering what format to put it in, and was waiting for feedback on it but that does seem the easiest idea
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:15:55
Kind of as these are only a fraction of what I would want to implement into my platform, as those are all share exchanges.
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:25:11
Unfortunately it is (although I guess I shouldn't admit it), I'll just have to proofread it a bit. Thanks for the heads up

It makes sense for people to be scared and act greedy, but I believe that although some people want this to be a bubble so that they will be able to make a considerable profit, most people (if we believe r/bitcoin) would like this to be an alternative to everyday currency, and if regular major crashes occur to often then Bitcoin will not be seen as stable, so an unfit and insecure alternative to everyday currency. You are right people are highly unlikely to listen to whatever anyone says, but I believe that if people want this to be a good alternative they will need to look more into what makes the markets fluctuate.

Not really, I don't see how that would happen
@_date: 2013-03-06 18:52:23
Well the fact that the currency appreciates 100% will not stop people to trade, on the contrary a mispriced orange juice will lead to surge in orange juice being bought, which will push the price up, thus bringing it back to its equilibrium.

Well, best case scenario would be to write a in depth analysis of the subject at hand (not to hard so everyone can understand). Then maybe have a video version of a tl;dr in a kind of animated way no longer than 2:30 long, because lets be honest very little people are going to be bothered to read they would much rather watch a youtube video

I know, but I think some people may be more inclined to trade their commodities in Bitcoin once a proper platform is up. I was thinking a platform such as MtGox that would allow users to trade whatever they want (not just bitcoins vs currency) at the prices they want. Might give the people the little push they need.

To start off with I would mainly like to have forex, commodities and options on one same platform. Securities and shares are more complicated and would have to be done at a later stage (if possible at all for securities).
As for the legal trouble that isn't really my domain so I wouldn't know, but what would be offered to trade would be simple things, currencies, commodities, options on commodities/currencies... so there shouldn't be to much trouble.
