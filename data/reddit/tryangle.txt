Interesting paper if you have not yet seen it. 
My cryptic post aside, digital money was something of an open question for humanity over the past 25 or so years. It took a few iterations, but we finally have something that seems to work pretty well.

I have a couple of questions for you Olaf.
First and foremost, can you explain why I, as someone who is interested in the vitality of Bitcoin, should work for a third party processor? Do you know what the name Satoshi Nakamoto means when translated into english? It means 'a warning against middlemen'. 
The next question is this: can you explain to me how you plan to compete against Circle?

Speaking a language fluently does not automatically guarantee that someone understands every possible meaning of every word or word combination. Add this to the complexity granted by a writing system such as Kanji, and I hope that you will understand my skepticism towards your skepticism. 
* **Nakamoto Name Meaning**:  ‘central origin’ or ‘(one who lives) in the middle’; found mostly in the Ryukyu islands. 
* **さとし**		guidance; admonition 
However, if you are truly Japanese, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this.

I'm still not sold on the long term viability of such a model but I do understand now that it represents a necessary stopgap measure. 
Thank you

In the past I had used your method of deciphering the meaning behind the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It came out to something along the lines of "wisdom inside the origin" which I thought referred to [the phrase that is tucked inside the genesis block](
The crucial turning point for me though was realizing that maybe Satoshi Nakamoto is not a name, but a phrase. I had to keep in mind that the man behind Bitcoin might have been someone with a foreigner's understanding of Japanese. Someone who was able to bend the rules in an unnatural way. 
Either way, and as you have said yourself, there are a wide variety of ways to interpret these things, but I guess that is half of the fun.
