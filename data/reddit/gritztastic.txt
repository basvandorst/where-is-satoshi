The scammers probably only seek out sellers they can use fake receipts on, and would ignore any requests to meet in person.
I did read something on here a few weeks ago though by a seller that got paid counterfeit cash in person though, that's way more ballsy scamming than photoshopping receipts.

Is the assumption that they were stolen in a few big chunks, or is the assumption that they were slowly stolen over a long period of time, in small, random amounts so as to avoid detection of the theft? (both of these theories assume they were actually stolen, not seized or lost).
With the former, it should be easy to spot, with the latter though, it could be very difficult to untangle.

FWIW, I submitted ACH withdrawal docs to bitfloor April 17th ~10:30pm, and it's still showing as 'pending, 2-3 days'. 
I'm hoping the delay is due to glacial pace of banks opening new accounts with giant checks (With KYC laws, I wouldn't be surprised if quite a few banks didn't want to touch it, due to the potential of a bunch of angry people waiting for their $$ back).

That is awesome, congrats! I did it the other way. Used my annual work bonus and tax refund to get rid of $7500 credit card debt, and spent the remaining 500$ on bitcoins in January. 
Kinda kicking myself I didn't go the other way, but I am still debt free, and after (stupidly) spending a few BTC on TF2 items in January I still have nearly 17btc remaining. My wife has already told me that she expects it to cover a down payment on a house in a few years :)

From the link, hopefully this offers some comfort:
--begin paste--
we would like to assure those of you who sent deposits to our old details that our old IBAN is still active and your transfers, if otherwise sent with correct information, should arrive without a problem.
Please note that SEPA transfers usually take 1 to 3 business days to arrive and would kindly ask those waiting for your SEPA transfers longer than usually to please send us a transfer confirmation so that we can examine our bank account log and locate your transfers.
Also for those waiting on deposits we ask for your patience; we have accumulated a long list of transfers which lack information or contain wrong information which means we need to manually go through all of them instead of our system sorting them automatically.
Best regards

I'll bet there's a whole bunch of folks that prefer cash -&gt; bitcoin vs bank account to bitcoin, but I agree, coinbase is 1000% less hassle than bitinstant (well, approx 1000%).

Yeah, I remember reading as recently as January 100$ being the magical, off-in-the-distant-future price that would convince folks to sell their hoard.

Random question- when you sell BTC on coinbase, is it instant/market rate/USD to coinbase account (like Mt. Gox, where you can go back and forth between USD and BTC); or when you sell BTC, is it instantly queued into the ACH system for eventual arrival in your bank account?

It could be as simple as ransom. 'Hey Silk road, we'll stop the attack for 5000 BTC'
And since everything is anonymous, even if the Silk road capitulated and paid the ransom- the ransom could go to someone pretending to be directing the attacks, or the anonymous attackers could simply start the attack again at a later date (or not stop it at all).

For protection against volatility, a company can use, for example, coinbase's payment API. It lets a merchant accept bitcoins, which are sold instantaneously for local fiat currency. That way, if you sell $10,241.36 worth of items with this setup, you'll never see a bitcoin, and the exact amount of $10,241.36 will be direct deposited into your bank account.
At least that's how they described it in one of their recent blog posts, I've never actually used it.

No, there will not. At least not with the current payment card system that allows charge-backs. 
 Any company that attempts to set up such a system will be charge-backed into oblivion as hackers and carders drain the company of bitcoins.

Agreed, the 2-4 day wait is not difficult though, as it requires no effort on the part of the user, and can be done from a computer.
The 'I need BTC today' options are more effort, either BitInstant or a local seller. Both involve cash and travel, and may be a bit more expensive.
Fast, Cheap, Easy- pick two :)

I would transfer the money out of Paypal ASAP, close that account, and open up a fresh one (if possible, to a separate bank account, so paypal can't hit your primary checking account). Sorry to sound alarmist, but I've been scammed by a 'not as described' buyer on ebay and it sucks.

I get 'pending' when withdrawing BTC from coinbase ranging from 1 hour-24 hours. I think they have all transfers in the 'slow lane' to reduce the risk of fraud.

Scammer can pay via credit card through paypal, then call their credit card company and say that the paypal charges were unauthorized. CC company reverses/holds the funds to paypal, who in turn has to hold the funds in dispute (so the shit rolls downhill, seller is at bottom of hill).

Good advice. Use whatever is left after taxes to create future security (investments that pay regular dividends, for example, so you can just take to interest to supplement your regular monthly income), and keep the same lifestyle.
