Good to know! Would be nice if it was clearly stated that free accounts do not have the same terms as the paid once. Mining was my first thought but then I noticed that Google doesnt have GPU instances, so it would be pretty inefficient anyway.

thanks for the hint, docker nodes sounds like a neat idea.

yep, was syncing from scratch.

I know many bored PhD students with access to their nations biggest supercomputing facilities. Running code for your "home project" is of course illegal and you face getting kicked out and charged but that doesnt mean its impossible for a very large group of people.

I am using the free trial (for 60 days) which I think is using the same ToS as the paid accounts.

I agree with the comment and dont agree with what the previous question seems to suggest (that running a node on Google doesnt add value to the network). Some thoughts:
* free traffic and bandwidth is great for the network, as long as we are not **all** on the same cloud
* While building and testing a service on top of a decentralized network (Bitcoin or Ethereum) I need access to a node.

That doesnt make sense, traffic is metered which means if I exceed $300 of traffic (that would be *a lot* of traffic), I pay for it since I had to register my credit card to even get started.

thanks, I contacted support straight away by email and the console webpage and didnt even get a default reply back along the lines of "your request has been filed, we will get back to you".

Hey thanks for checking it out! Any mnemonic is generated by some source of entropy - here I use a dice as a means of generating entropy. The `dice2keys.sh` script generates your mnemonic. But thanks for the heads-up, I think I should focus more on documentation and also provide a script specifically generating the mnemonic (and not just the pub keys or seed)!

I have seen the first prototype during the last Zurich Bitcoin Meetup. While being minimalistic it looks and feels higher quality than any of the other hardware wallets. I'm up for it.

good idea to just try the last words! (IMO the minor loss of entropy as pointed out in my comment there can be ignored)  
 The checksum in the last word requires the calculation of one SHA256. That is indeed possible with pen and paper - [at least for this guy]( But I'm aiming more at long-term archiving that does not rely on a wallet (until I want to move funds) so I want my scripts to also calculate the pub keys. That is a lot harder with pen and paper (one HMAC-SHA512 for the private key and one elliptic curve multiplication for the pub key) so I dont see there's any way to avoid involving a computer in any case.

Beware that \`Replace the last word you rolled with this calculated one\` reduces the entropy beyond what one normally has with 12/24 word mnemonic sentences.  According to BIP39, the checksum size for 12 words is 4 bit and for 24 words is 8 bit. As each word encodes 11 bit you're loosing 7 or 3 bit respectively. So probably nothing too worrying.
