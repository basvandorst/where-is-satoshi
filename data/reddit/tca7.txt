So frustrating to be a noob on btctalk.

That is the best visual for people to understand the ease and real world application of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 00:26:57
Totally agree! Here is my stance on the matter...

TechCrunch was on this and nothing was adding up.

I am looking for people that are looking for liquidity from their Gox accounts

Not always. Would be nice on Apple products to be able to do this as well
@_date: 2014-01-08 14:12:29
Yeah I cant imagine using them anymore either. The fees that they charge are ridiculous. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:22:21
I think I did the same! Hope so...just learning here

Nah,  not writing a BS article on my thoughts. I have been telling anyone that can listen about Bitcoin. And this is the question that comes back. 
I want all opinions, real world situations, etc.

Why should we trust Paypal to be judge and jury on how we spend our money?
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:52:39
Did some research.
Headed over to r/Ebay is search for a contrary opinion.  Horror stories everywhere...
I can see now why EBay is embracing Bitcoin.  Sellers on EBay and merchants in real world need fast confirmation and clearance of money.  If you want to buy, be willing to pay.

Everyone who transacts online.  And others who have been historically concerned over transacting online because of the lack of safety and concern over their privacy.
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:09:00
Didn't realize that method would produce a more favorable result.  Will do in the future
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:00:38
Will def post. One sided?  Give me both sides. So far Bitcoin 21 Paypal 0.

Headed over to r/Ebay
I can't post yet but took a look around.  Horror stories everywhere.  I feel for this kid...
 
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:01:28
Haha. To answer your question- yes!  Thats just me being greedy. Thank you for your response. If you think of more keep em coming. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:17:01
To be fair I am going to post this question in r/Ebay
Karma me up boys and girls!  This should be interesting.
