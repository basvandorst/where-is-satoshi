A credit card transaction is not the same as a faster payments transfer. UK retailers still have to wait days to receive the money from credit card purchases.

Fair enough. I thought it was quite beginner friendly myself. Multibit is really easy to get started with.

Firstly, stop using the Blockchain wallet. Download a real wallet like Electrum.
Secondly, eToro is not a site where you can buy and withdraw Bitcoin, it treats bitcoin like a stock for investment,  eToro offers CFD (contract for difference) trading, which is risky business especially if you are new to this. You do not own underlying assets. Withdraw your money from eToro and start again. Contact eToro support if you can't figure it out, I just had a look at their site and can't see what to do without signing up for an account, which I'm not going to try on a site that looks to be completely useless.
Once you have your money back, you can send it to a real bitcoin exchange. If you are in Sweden I would recommend Kraken or Bitstamp. If you can't be bothered with exchanges and verification, you can buy Bitcoin through Localbitcoins.com. They will be slightly more expensive than the exchanges, but you pay for convenience.  Once you have bought some bitcoin, withdraw them to your Electrum wallet..

ZipZap's UK payment processors have decided that they will no longer process payment for Bitcoin, so ZipZap no longer works. Localbitcoins is fine in the UK though.

You can buy BTC on Bitstamp or Kraken using SEPA transfer. You need to sign up and verify yourself on one of those exchanges and then click on 'SEPA deposit' . You could also try Localbitcoins.com which will be slightly more expensive but won't require messing about with verification.

A web wallet is never the best option.  
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:14:42


Or even better than that, just use a real wallet on your own computer/phone.
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:44:02
ZipZap is just a cash payment processor. Multiple companies can sell things using ZipZap for payment.

I know plenty of people like this. You can explain it to them many times using simple pictures and it just goes in one ear and out of the other.

Yes, hopefully it will only be temporary.

I just checked their rate. It was £310 which is $518. at the time of writing the price on Bitstamp is $506
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:51:34


How do you expect them to do that without accessing your contacts?
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:39:27
Multibit is also good, but why not Electrum? It is really good.

I actually meant network bandwidth. I could run a load of those off the solar panels at my cabin but I get a very slow (mobile) internet connection there. I've not looked into mining before now because of the excessive power usage.
@_date: 2011-07-10 16:02:28


Are you sure about that. The site doesn't mention Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2011-08-23 21:00:07
You are correct.  If you download this blockchain it will not be verified and could be wrong. There is already a trusted download here: 
Your client **WILL NOT** verify OP's blockchain so please be careful.
(no offense meant to OP, but I don't know you so I don't trust you)

Engrave the private key on something non-corrosive. Engrave it on some gold/glass and encase it in concrete and will last longer than you will.

It (the third wallet) doesn't need to be online to *receive* funds. You can check that the transaction has gone through using [block explorer](
If you want to send funds from the third wallet, bring it online, wait for it to update the blocks (it will not show the balance correctly until this is complete) and then send.  
Then create a fourth wallet offline and transfer any remaining savings to it. Once the transaction is confirmed and the third wallet is verified as empty delete the third wallet. 
I'm no computer expert myself so my explanation may not make much sense... (it's really late here)  I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm talking out of my ass.

You could give him an item of jewelry or a collectible that works as a bit coin savings wallet.   Put some Bitcoins into a wallet and then get the address, private key and hex engraved onto the item.
He can then store his Bitcoin savings around his neck/wrist and there is no chance of it getting hacked.  He can send Bitcoin to the address an unlimited number of times and to spend it he just imports the private key into the Bitcoin client. It's totally secure as long as he doesn't lose it.
@_date: 2011-08-23 21:06:35
That is incorrect. They could give themselves a large balance that your client would then accept, change balances or even put you on their own fork of the blockchain.
@_date: 2011-06-25 03:48:48
Magicaltux just pointed out that you can log in and check your balance now...    I hadn't noticed that.

It doesn't have to be 'sent through the system'.  It is much easier to transport and exchange an encrypted usb flash drive than a lot of cash.

Bitomat was for sale for the exact amount of BTC lost. The purchase money goes to the refunds, not the previous owner.
(I think)
@_date: 2011-06-26 02:55:48
Short answer - yes
My method is...
Have one wallet (always online and un encrypted) for small amounts/pocket change.
Second wallet as shown in the wiki, this wallet contains medium sized amounts and is only online/mounted when I make a send transaction.
Third wallet, heavily encrypted and on a computer that never goes online. (savings wallet)
second and third wallets are backed up to two encrypted flashdrives, one stored at home, the other in a safe at a friends house.

I've also had  a few non tech savvy friends asking me how to buy bitcoin recently.  I gave them a short lesson on it a few days ago, they bought 1btc each from localbitcoins and I taught them how to move it about and use paper wallets etc..  these are people that I've been telling about bitcoin for years, but they weren't interested until they read the news story about the guy in Oslo.
