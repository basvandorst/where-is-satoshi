Fork bitcoin and send them fake ones with a keylogger as a super duper surprise present

My local atm charges 800 CAD over spot but no KYD. Only a mobile number so they can send you a code. It makes sense for me because the fees can be between 10-12% for online options and you basically have to give your left kidney to buy BTC online in Canada. I wouldn't use one of these though, that fee is huge and the information you had to disclose was whack

Hello friend! I dont know about you but I'm going to be accumulating for the next few months! All the best
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:00:12
Prove it ;) I'll even post the transaction details. Try me.
@_date: 2018-11-30 06:39:29
Lol, "December or February." That's cool. I predict that BTC will see a new ATH sometime within the next 2-36 months

The fees seem like a lot with the ATMs but each one is privately owned and will charge a different amount. Anything 10% or under is lower than you'll get online. As a Canadian who had dealt with this horseshit personally, my suggestion would be to use ATMs. The only other solution that might be equally fast is Changelly, but they wanted something like 12-20% lol. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-01-07 01:18:44
Out of curiosity, why do you want to avoid ATMs? The transactions are usually KYC free and take 10 minutes from start to finish, plus the fees are usually lower than any other service. For reference, my local ATM charges 8-10% flat, while online services typically start at 10% everywhere 
@_date: 2019-01-05 19:24:48
Canadian banks are the worst. Its not that you need to pay more tax than other countries, its that they make it impossible to claim in the first place because the level of record keeping you need to maintain is far beyond reasonable. Basically, a crypto trader in Canada has to pay for a 3rd party service in order to track their trades to the standards required.

I spent hours on this only to realize that there is no such thing as a 32 character private key :/
 
But the address is legitimate and has 1 BTC

This must be hella old. The new 100s have been out for quite awhile and they're secure to the tits. Plastic with dozens of security features

Sorry for the late teply. This iz what I do. I just open my wallet at home and leave. I scan the address QR code without internet. The address and QR code won't change so you don't need internet once the QR code is on your phone screen. You'll need internet to receive your funds obviously but that can wait until you get home
@_date: 2019-01-11 18:46:41
Interesting thought experiment
@_date: 2019-01-05 15:55:58
If you really want to get away with not using a phone, you could write down your entire address and then type it in manually at the atm. They give you that option. It would just be a lot of work with a lot of risk - what if you type one letter wrong? Maybe look into getting an old smartphone with no sim card off craigslist or something OP

It's only a big deal to everyone commenting here because crypto is important to everyone here. I'm sure some weirdo somewhere is upset about the hard candy thing too.
To the person who said that most marketing schemes aren't targeting the uninformed: that is incorrect. Literally every marketing tactic is meant to target the uninformed. People don't buy stupid shit unless they think it has value lol. Think about it.
Also, there is a difference between being a dick marketer and being a scam artist. Yes, bitcoin.com is sneaky and sly and they trick people. But they don't *outright* trick people. The site is actually explicitly clear on the difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash.
Essentially, I'm saying that seeing people complain about Roger is annoying. He may be a dick but he's a smart dick. Hate him for knowing how to market his product all you want, but it's a bit weird.

That sucks someone told me to buy Google stocks in 1923 and they've dropped since

Store your crypto on a mobile wallet and just take it with you on your plane lol. No one is going to randomly hack a mainstream wallet provider during the few hours you might be on a plane. Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:05:36
Hey man, this is delivered much better than the last time I saw you post. People will definitely see this and read into it now. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:24:28
Thanks for sharing this. Made me laugh and so true
@_date: 2019-01-17 12:54:17
I checked out this site the other day and it was pretty transparent... there was even an explanation on how bch and btc are different 
Ever wonder why hard candies say "fat free" on them when hard candies are made of sugar and dont have fat in them to begin with? Its marketing. Most people can read the ingredients or come to their own conclusions about the label, but some fall for the trap and eat hard candies because they're "healthy." 
It's the same thing with bch. It's just marketing. Most people who do five minutes of research know the difference, but some fall for the marketing trap. You can complain all you want, but literally *everything* in the *entire* world is marketed like this. Every single item that we buy and use every day. Why should crypto be any different?
I don't own any bch and I don't condone sly marketing tactics, but seriously it's not a big deal. I bought grapples the other day and read after that a grapple is just a grape flavoured regular apple. Did I run over to r/apples to complain? No, I did not.

If you want speed and ease of access look into changelly or changenow

This happened roughly 3 months ago

Lol wut
Also yea, I guess this could be one of the handful of stores near the border but this is a Canadian company 
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:32:25
Do you guys Google "buy bitcoin" and then immediately jump to page 467? I see posts every day about people using unknown services
@_date: 2019-01-08 00:11:18
Oof yea that's not a very good rate lol. I can't believe they're charging that much in your area :/
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:43:00
I ate an edible a little while ago and this thread is just golden. Take my upvote sir

I dont hate your artwork brother. Its just a bit too busy for me. It took awhile for my brain to process what I was looking at
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:19:02
I think that was where the sarcasm comes from homie
@_date: 2018-12-25 05:38:55
ATMs in my area charge 8% flat while coinbase or others services charge 10-12%. I think coinbase was 10% and changelly was 12%. Those services are super hard to access for those who live in Canada too, so I'm sure it's the same in some other countries. It makes sense to use an ATM
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:39:16
The price is being controlled by big players and media FUD. If you look a bit harder there are just as many videos saying the opposite. The only way to invest right now is by doing your own research
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:30:14
Crypto and stocks dont correlate, but the people who think that they do usually say they move in the same direction for FUD. I think 5300 is possible. Beyond the simple fact that you've made a prediction, you're probably over thinking this a lot homie

I clicked on this because the title looked interesting, but what the fuck did I just read? Lol. Of course you wouldn't launch paper money directly into space or see a bunch of space pirates floating around in space boats filled with gold. You're comparing the usecase for cryptocurrencies in space against weird examples that would never happen, even in the strangest futures.
By the way, you can use traditional fiat via debit or credit in space, the same as bitcoin. You would need to transmit a bunch of radio waves into space to connect with some kind of central network in either scenario. How do you think Bitcoin works? It isn't magic. It uses the internet in most cases 
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:54:43
Like some of you, I feel like it is much too soon to expect a recovery. This looks like a classic bull trap to me. Yet, if it is a bull trap, it looks like it will be a huge one with tons of people getting rekt left right and center. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-12-23 03:47:03
Really? You have people here posting almost daily about sending their BTC to virus dot com fake wallet dot biz and losing all their money, but you're gonna shit on legitimate wallets like jaxx?  This is the reason why we have this issue. A handful of users have had bad experiences with jaxx, but no one can be found who used the virus dot biz wallet. No news is good news right? Why use a reputable wallet like jaxx when the virus dot biz wallet offers "maximum batcorns potentiates with thubdar network?" Sounds good to me right?
I've used jaxx. Its rated as a three star wallet because it's a three star wallet. If it was a terrible wallet it wouldn't be a three star wallet.
OP, just DYOR man. Find something with reviews and take things with a grain of salt until you test them yourself. There isn't a single perfectly reviewed wallet on the market and there never will be. 
You can try:
Jaxx, coinomi, edge, samourai, mycelium... read the reviews and look into it yourself

Fork bitcoin and send them fake unspendable currency with a keylogger attached 
@_date: 2018-12-24 07:03:24
Lots of people yea but are they right? Can bitcoin even be charted with stockmarket based analysis techniques? Can it be predicted with a sound understanding of economics?
No  no and no. No one is ever right... some people come close and make money though 
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:59:51
Maybe. Or it could be that the shorters  noticed some heavy volume indicating a bottom and liquidated accordingly. It might not be significant in the long run 
Edit: you said longs lol. My bad. I think there will always be cautious people who close longs early but who knows
@_date: 2018-12-15 02:05:35
Haha. Go with your gut and don't worry about the downvotes. Half of us say BTC is going nowhere despite the clear success of lightning network and a massive increase in users and mainstream adoption in general. The other half of us sound like an AI that had to learn how to post on reddit based on information from CNN and Bloomberg with a dash of MSNBC and shit. Do you think this is a good investment? That's the only question you need to worry about. There's a lot going on right now haha
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:51:12
Lol. The US economy does badly because of orange man and suddenly there's a "global recession" coming. I dunno what to tell you but things look fine in my country (Canada), the only reason why anything is even remotely suffering right now is because of the stupid trade war that has nothing to do with us.
Edit: inb4 Trudeau is a cuck
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:50:56
This seems like the most logical analysis right now. 100% assuming a bull trap. There will be plenty of time to continue DCA strategies into January. Hell, the consensus like 2 days ago on reddit was that the bear market would continue into at least mid 2019. Funny.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:26:06
BTC is traded against USD, so yea the conversion rate applies 
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:56:33
Lol, you said something that sounds like phallus 
@_date: 2018-12-23 01:35:53
A lot of nonsense in this thread.
Just use a Bitcoin atm. Most of them let you sell BTC directly for USD. You just wait like 20 minutes for the 2 confirmations and it'll spit out whatever amount you sold. Find one without KYC if you want, they're all privately run and not everyone needs your info
@_date: 2018-12-16 03:21:58
That won't actually have any effect on how tradebots make decisions. It's not like some programmer is going to see a small blip in the exchanges API and go "lol nice" either 
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:32:55
Ugh. Just read the article. All they did was create copper powder composed of super small granules. The overall surface area was then high enough that it worked more efficiently as a catalyst.
Article should be called "Scientists turn copper into smaller pieces of copper"

No. If you came here asking if apples were healthy, one person would say yes, 10 would say no, 10 more would post charts about vitamin concentrations and shit, and 10 more would say that the nutrition of an apple is intrinsic or whatever the fuck. So no, this is not a good place for advice lol
