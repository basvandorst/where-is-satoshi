ITTY BITTY EXCHANGE – THE FUTURE IN INTERNATIONAL VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRADING
Introducing a new, truly international exchange trading out of Hong Kong but with local presences in Australia, New Zealand, Bali, Israel..., United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Vietnam, Bolivia and most of the European Union.
THE INSTANT EXCHANGE
On 11/11/13 we will launch the fixed price exchange component of Itty Bitty. (7.5% to buy BitCoin, 2.9% to sell BitCoin) You will be able to anonymously purchase virtual currency using your local fiat currency in major banks throughout your country. Initially only BitCoin but with other virtual currencies like LiteCoin being added later. In this first month, only Australia, Hong Kong and New Zealand will be active for trading.
We should even be able to service the USA (You buying BitCoin) once we've obtained the relevant state licenses.
If you are selling us virtual currency, we can pay you via telegraphic transfer or by PayPal. Usually you will get your funds within 4 business hours, Australian EST. No longer than 24 hours.
If you are buying virtual currency, we will usually send you coin within 4 hours. No longer than 24 hours.
THE SPOT EXCHANGE
On 11/12/13 we are launching Itty Bitty stage 2 - a full multi fiat / multi virtual currency spot exchange. Buy the cryptocurrency of your choice using whatever fiat currency you choose. Sell it too.
Depending on your location, you will need to provide identification.
Rates are 0.5% initially.
After doing business with us for 3 months and providing ID, you will become verified and the ability to send us electronic bank transfers (such as telegraphic transfers) will unlock. We figure by then you are the genuine account holder and there wont be any charge backs. Until you are verified, deposits need to be done in a bank.
MONEY TRANSMISSION
Just like PayPal and similar to Western Union, you will be able to send funds (including cryptocurrency) direct to an email address of your choice. If the recipient doesn’t have an account with us, they will be invited to sign up. Fees are 1.5%. Half of PayPal’s.
Get enough sign ups and we’ll give you significant discounts on trades. Or even free trades.
BUY GOLD!
You can buy gold with whatever currency you choose and we will ship it to you. Anywhere in the world.Insured.Quickly.Competitively. We’ve partnered with the largest online gold seller in Australia (Gold Stackers) to facilitate this.
Fully implemented KYC and AML policies protect you and protect us. All relevant financial licenses have been obtained in each of the countries we trade in and we intend to keep them.
Unlike other exchanges, we get your funds to you quickly. We answer our emails and if we screw something up, we fix it and wont make you wear the cost like some. We wont let you down.
Thanks for taking the time to read our announcement. See you in cyberspace!
