Coinbase has a premium as the entry point to crypto for a lot of people hence a higher trading price. 
Bitfinex fakes their volume and order books.

That was a crappy explanation.
A dead cat bounce is simply when the price recovers a bit after a huge drop but then continues to drop again. 
The meaning coming from that even a dead cat will bounce when you drop it.

You're obviously not clued up.
They're all in the red because of arbitrage to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin tanks = alts tank. It's all connected.

If Bitcoin price lowers. The alts become more valuable in ratio and bots will trade them into Bitcoin to close the gap and make profit.

LocalBitcoins would work. 
I'm guessing from your username you're from Aberdeen. There isn't much in the way of buying up here. I've used localbitcoins before and its fine, but as others say, you pay a bit of a premium.

We the taxpayer are paying for it. Your contribution in taxes will not determine the level or amount of treatment you require or need.
I'm no advocating for 'theft' unless you call taxes theft. I don't pay any higher taxes than you, and I benefit from a free education to degree level and free healthcare.
Free = free at the point of use. 
Are you saying the poor should be left to die?.  The US is lightyears behind the rest of the world in how it handles healthcare. It's incredible that some people would try to defend it. In any civilized society free healthcare and education are the cornerstones of a successful and happy population.

Give it up pal.
Most of the developed world have free healthcare. It's not advocating slavery at all. Doctors choose to work and are compensated. It's just the model is paid for by taxes, simple. 
My mother had terminal cancer and she didn't pay a fucking dime for her healthcare and she received the best treatment and care anyone could ask for. That my friend, is worth paying your taxes for.
Free education is also easily doable, because my country has both.

I still believe in Ethereum for that very reason. It has the potential for legit use. There's no hard cap, but there is a soft cap and with the POS update next year, I think Ethereum can still be very profitable in the long term, assuming the crypto market doesn't have its arse fall off.

Not going to argue. My world is the reality, no taxes is a dream.

It's not a correction. It's money flowing out in an attack on BTC. Simple as. Corrections don't usually end up with one coin being pumped.

Honestly he doesn't give a fuck in all likely hood. He's the head of a bank. He's loaded, and he's smart. The banks have fingers in all pies and he probably knows a lot more about this than the average bitcoiner.

Credit cards are designed to trap you. What better way to enslave someone into debt than giving them a 0% credit card?. They impulse buy, end up with a debt they can't hope to pay off anytime soon, and eventually they end up paying interest. Some people have credit card debt that they might never pay off.

Guys, these's pumps aren't in response to news or anything like that.
They are artificial pumps by whales, most probably exchanges themselves. This is why you see massive correction. Prices don't just pump in less than an hour on a Sunday for no reason.

Depends where you are from.
Bitfinex has by far the most volume for BTC, but they are closing to US personal customers. 
Use coinmarketcap and check the markets for each currency to get a breakdown of how much each exchange has in volume.
