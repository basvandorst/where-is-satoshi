Clean interface and transactions are easy. 
Will it be possible for the seller to give out different software keys to each buyer? maybe from a predefined list?

Thanks for the excellent guide. I've used localbitcoins a few times and the experience was positive. They even started an online escrow recently which lets you buy bitcoins with bank transfer or cash deposit!

Frankly, theres not much awareness about bitcoins in India right now. One of the earlier trading exchanges, Tradehill, tried implementing INR transactions but there was not enough people doing it to make it profitable.
You can always buy a few coins through localbitcoins.com which now offers online escrow transactions too and it works great.
A starting point I think would be to try and spread awareness about bitcoins in your local circle and if you find there is enough awareness and demand for bitcoins only then having a dedicated site would be viable.

Thanks a lot for doing this. 
I was thinking of donating to an organization that works for patients like me and this post just gave me the much needed push to finally do it.

Nice work and thanks for sharing.
The .ods file doesn't work for me since I'm using excel 2010 and apparently excel strips all formulas from .ods files on opening. Is it possible to get a link for .xls version please?

I think localbitcoins.com would be a good addition to this guide since its one of the easiest ways to buy bitcoins with cash.
