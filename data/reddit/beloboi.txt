I fully agree that govs cant stop BTC transactions, nor lightning. But they can scare the shit out of normal people by saying btc is now evil stuff and we close all exchanges (aka bitcoin-onramps)
I am pretty sure that card will be played by some governments in the next years. I am not saying they will win because of this but its gonna hurt for sure.

tl:dr this news has nothing to do with BTC. It only shows that IRR is in trouble

thing is ... whales dump BTC when price is high, whales buy more BTC when price is low. net result: BTCs are concentrating.
and in the next round (next bull run) they have even more power to crash the market.

Indeed those numbers appear as if distribution increased. Big if true. ;)
Keep in mind though that BTC addresses won't reflect anything that happens on the exchanges: If I had successfully accumulated BTC in the last 12 month it would only show up in the statistic if I had sent the coins out of the exchange.

I understand your point and I was also looking at the situation like this in the beginning. However remember that back then people switched to segwit*2x* capable clients and were signaling support. In the however segwit suceeded and segwit2x did not. So the fact that there was measurable support did not help s2x at all.
Well, the idea is that miners were scared their blocks would be rejected by those UASF nodes. Which would have been a desaster for them.

So in Choyna one can buy bitcoins that you cannot do anything but trading on one exchange. Whoa, this sounds like the future of finance. ;)
I have some doubts that after said installation of all that AML/KYC stuff China is going to allow sending the BTC without restrictions to anyone in the world. I think they will log to what adress BTC were paid out, only allow a previously registered address which is connected to a person and whenever those BTC leave that address again the person will receive a love letter from PBoC.

Of course, it is good for the non-chinese bitcoin exchanges that probably a few million BTC are locked away. This creates extra scarcity and leads to higer prices.
However volatility will increase to because the exchanges are less liquid. So tread carefully.

I don't agree with this guy saying Ethereum is doomed because of a poor specification of the 'send' function in Solidity.
 * manual fixes to the recursive send problem have been posted elsewhere and they make sense (basically locking or changing the order of operations)
 * later versions of Solidity could deprecate current send and replace it with a version that is hard to use wrong (currently it is easy to use 'send' the wrong way)
Cryptocurrencies are young. Mistakes happen as humans are no machines.
Btw: Someone posted an interesting approach to battle the DAO attack. It involves counterattacking the attacker's child DAO. If this thing takes place it's going to be an open battle between black and white hat hackers taking place on the internet (or Ethereum blockchain). 
This idea alone is priceless and definitely worth the fun! :)

@_date: 2016-06-26 10:49:44
I beg to differ.
On bitcoin.de Friday morning prices went up to 660 € (translates to ~730 USD) for around one hour before it went down and matched the prices on bitstamp/bitfinex/huobi et al.
I've made trades selling for 650,660 and 663 EUR to back my observation. I don't have exact volume numbers but considering the the price was way above what was going on other exchanges I assume the volume was higher than usual.
What is interesting is that bitcoin.de is usually a slow moving exchange because the fiat part of the trade needs to be done via a SEPA transfer (in many cases) but on Friday it was in extreme buying frenzy and prices jumped from 635 to 660 within minutes (I can also back this up with trades).
I have to admit though that 'German angst' and FOMO played a role on this major Germany-based exchange.

@_date: 2018-10-15 17:35:08
They could actually just send their crypto elsewhere.
However some dudes like to play a risky game and sell their coins to receive USDT. If Bitfinex sorts out their banking issue and 1 USDT equals 1 USD again, BTC price will dive and they people made fast cash.
It could however turn into a fiasco for them as well. Actually Bitfinex employees and people close to them would know best ....

Actually if Bitfinex/Tether is confident about their business they could always* buy sub-1.0$ and using actual USD reserves. I hope those shorting USDT happily have that on their radar ...
*Until they run out of money but most likely the market will then have understood that they own the USD for real.
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:55:25
sure, the liquid sidechains destroys BCH's raison d'etre: "Oh noes, them darn smallblockers are transfering more of their coinz on a chain outside of their 1-2.6MB block size limit. So their tx fees sink and allow more space for non-trading related txs. Must be eevul!!11!"

BTC prices on bitcoin.de are 5% above bitstamp/huobi and co. Buying frenzy at its best!
@_date: 2016-06-26 11:02:00
Unfortunately there is some serious manipulation at work:
Those extreme high and extreme low values are often tiny amounts of BTC (0.1 and less). Because of the way bitcoin.de works a buyer/seller can chose to buy/sell for easily a price that is far away from the average.
Additionally clients are allowed to have multiple accounts on the platform: I assume that those out of the average trades are just attempted manipulations. The buyer and seller of such a trade is the same person and is willing to lose a bit (the 0.5% trade fee) as he/she is later able to profit when the manipulation works out.
disclaimer: I am trading on bitcoin.de since ~2011.
Check this to verify my claim of extreme price trades being of a very low amount of BTC:

The *best* thing about your post among all those "know it alls" here is that you put your explanation into conditional instead of saying "It is actually like this ...", "Tether is a scam and therefore ...".

@_date: 2018-10-15 17:16:57
Wow, professional friendly advice.
If you'd sold at 7700$ on bitfinex today you made a smart move. Maybe another smart move would be to buy crypto with your fiat earnings and move it on a non-USDT exchange and turn it into "proper" (non-Tether) fiat.

Fair enough, that long term Bitcoiners understand what it means if an exchange goes down. But for all the people that bought in the last two months a (for example) chinese exchange closing for a while would cause them think "bitcoin has been hacked" ...
Actually I think it is crazy how much confidence people have in BTC. The system is great but all those places where it has contact with the traditional economy exposes a big surface for government intervention.
@_date: 2018-10-14 21:58:23
... and ironically they are right: The BTC blockchain is deliberately being kept small-blockish to have it decentralized, because then you can built as many complicated layers on top of that super strong base as you want.

However I don't see the arbitrage possibility. If there were you could do it on Poloniex because they have a BTC/USDT and a BTC/USDC market (another USD-based stablecoin) with apparently different prices.
@_date: 2018-10-14 19:19:18
True only if many major exchanges participate and most trading-related transfers run over liquid instead of bitcoin itself.
When my coins are in an exchange I already trust a 3rd party and sending them over the federated sidechain to another participating exchange appears logical to me.
I really hope that coinbase, gdax, bitstamp and maybe localbitcoins join that thing.
Everybody send support tickets to their not-yet participating exchange to make clear what the customer wish for.
@_date: 2018-10-15 20:06:55
So why is USDT then moving up, while BTC price on Bitfinex goes down and BTC price on non-USDT exchanges stays stable?
It is easier calling someone a fool, then reflecting apparently ...

Yeah, and all these rumors and "stay away" suggestions is what is causing USDT to drop and BTC (on bitfinex at least) to inflate. Brilliant show!
@_date: 2017-01-07 09:36:55
The whole idea of a rally is based upon the expectation that someone else will buy at a higher price. You yourself were thinking that when you bought. I am sure there is also a small minority of people who heard about BTC because of the rally but did *not* buy anything yet but will do so when it is calm.
Btw: The next rally can be expected in a few months (say 3 - 9).
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:45:54
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:21:32
Why do you think Bitfinex is *playing* this?
It's Bitfinex' traders that send USDT to Kraken and sell it there causing crypto prices on USDT-based exchanges to inflate. Which can cause a lot of leveraged short to be margin called. This actually brilliant (and a good point why you should not margin trade).
Getting short squeezed in a bear market. Welcome to the f*cking show! :D :D :D

btw As bitfinex cannot handle USD withdrawal request people are using other exchanges for this. The way to accomplish this is by sending USDT to Kraken, sell it for USD and withdraw.
Apparently this creates so much selling pressure that USDT price fell close to 0.970.
If bitfinex sorts out its banking issue the price will go back to normal and BTC price on Bitfinex (and poloniex) will subsequently fall to the levels of other exchanges. Smart (albeit risky) if you sold crypto when it was high (now) for USDT and keep it until the banking issue is resolved.
The other possibility is that bitfinex is in big trouble and will never allow USD withdrawals again. Then Dr Doom gets his reason to twitter how bad bitcoin and its ecosystem is.

I am totally fine if Localbitcoins accepts liquid transactions (in addition to the existing BTC on-chain txs) even though it is technically not an exchange.
If I have my coins in already in a centralized, gated, proprietary service, then I am not concerned about sending it through Liquid. Actually there are other solutions for the same task, namely Ripple, and I rather send it through Liquid because 1 L-BTC = 1 BTC forever and ever.

... and if some hackers break into a known exchange (like bitfinex in august 2016) then all pipe dreams of future riches are gone for a while (it took 4 years to recover from the last ATH bubble).
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:45:19
Of course, I am half joking. But this thing is totally weird: Ok, Tether is in tatters and crypto is doomed (tm).
So why does the BTC price inflate not only on Bitfinex (tether-only) but also on non-USDT exchanges? If the market were convinced Bitfinex implodes tomorrow and tether is about to die, wouldn't everybody run for the exit ASAP?
Here is my ad-hoc explanation how it worked?
* market is scared about the USDT situation already, USDT price hits ~0.93
* there is low liquidity on Kraken's USDTUSD order book
* a bunch of whales do:
* buying BTC @ Bitfinex
* selling USDT @ Kraken
* public thinks: "OMG, Tether crashes!"
* people panic sell on Kraken
* people FOMO buy on Bitfinex
Why manipulation?
Kraken USDT price fell to 0.85 on Kraken and now returned to its previous 0.93 level (While BTC on all exchanges is still higher).
So while everybody is talking about tether, BTC price moved up.

Once you have coins on an exchange it's completely up to the exchange's security model if you can ever get any coins out. 
Liquid is for coins on exchanges.
Actually the exchanges have to do the conversion for me if I use their service. And they have to trust the Liquid network when depositing a share of the exchange's capital for this purpose.

Thanks for explaining!
However: With the intent of profiting from the zero-fee heaven I was thinking of trading on chinese exchanges and found out that only BTC China is zero-fee.
Fee schedules of the big chinese exchanges:
OKCoin: 
Huobi: 
BTC China: 
You argue that the zero fee trading leads to volumes being extremely big. However according to published data the volume on the two chinese exchange that have fees are many times bigger than the one that really has no fees:
OkCoin: 236,397.30 BTC (according to bitcoinwatch.com)
Huobi: 804,539.0649 BTC (from their website:  )
BTC China: 68,442 BTC (from their website)
Anyone trading on Huobi or Okcoin? Do they have fees or not?

I've seen cosy words being spread before. Weeks later there was the fighting again.
Man guys just think about it: If you are a miner (or a cartel) and you have control over more than 5% of the network's mining power then you can block segwit long enough to make people become so scared that they will panic sell. This will give you lots of cheap coins.
However you may not be the only bad dude out there and maybe someone else is also playing this game. This however could easily lead to a situation where the final activation time for segwit is missed and the new feature will not be ready.
In theory the segwit proposal could be re-run right after again but the above act would send shockwaves through the market and would be a unique opportunity for another cryptocoin to take the lead.

if liquid works as intended it will take load away from the btc blockchain which means lower fees for the btc users. so I dont even need to use liquid to profit from it.

USDT is gaining ground, BTC price on Bitfinex is going down (as expected) and BTC price non-USDT exchanges stay flat.

I don't buy this institutional money argument:
Big money is supposed to make more money aka fiat. So if I were "institutional money" I'd wait until the price is high and then short sell using cash-settled BTC futures.
Big money can hardly be interested in inflating BTC price as this would accelerate fiat meltdown and financial power shift to early BTC holders. I mean that would be very stupid. I am not saying though that big money can't do stupid moves but this would be completely idiotic ...
Much more likely is that BTC with its deflationary properties is slowly atracting more and more private investors with bigger and bigger pockets. However 6months after ATH its a bit too early to tell.
Next halving gonna bring some funny BTC prices, for sure.

We can only speculate until the owner of those nodes reveals themself.
Fact is that these 20 nodes providing 10-20 btc of capacity each are improving the network throughput alot.
Having to deal with a bunch of nodes also creates a certain interest that lnd becomes easier to administer. So hopefully someone now takes care of channels backups and not carelessly introducing breaking changes.
Plus it might inspire other actors to run a bunch of lightning nodes as well. The lnbig nodes are running lnd, I have no problem seeing a cluster of c-lightning and eclair nodes being deployed.... ;-)
@_date: 2018-11-17 12:28:51
someone is doing an interesting experiment. there are 20 nodes from the  "lnbig.com" domain having between 6-20 BTC in capacity. these nodes make up like two thirds of the whole LN capacity. 
that should be enough liquidity to make coffee payments work reliably.

Considering how few users the network has, this is way too much capacity for the moment. However that gives a lot of room for growth and then probably more people will run a bunch of nodes with 20 BTC capacity each.

Here is another cheer up: Until June 2019 there won't be any recovery to 20k. So whenever BTC is high and RSI indicates overbought, short and buy back much lower. Should bring you back into green quickly. Additionally it gives you the feeling that you are not powerless against the market forces.

I admire your optimism.
I am fully aware that a global governmental initiative to fight BTC creates a massive opportunity to profit from detracting.
Still by hitting the centralized exchanges by severing bank connections the governments can seriously hurt the ecosystem. Also confiscating the exchange's holdings using dubious legal claims might give countries an easy way to get hold of BTC for free.

it is true about mining becoming ineffective but I don't see why smaller mining operations have to shut down permanently and sell out to the bigger ones.
The machines could simply be stopped for a while and operations return when  prices make mining profitable again.
I won't stretch it too far but I assume that someone who invests thousands of dollars in mining equipment has a plan B ready for when things are not profitable for a while. The market being in bear mode for 10 months should have given a lot of time to prepare for the doomsday scenario.

Might be years but I might be terribly wrong as well.
The reason is that even though lightning is super new, the idea of paying with cryptocurrency is not anymore. So a merchant who is OK letting people pay with on-chain cryptocurrency is more likely to allow lightning payments as well, because it is not so much different anymore.
There is plenty of infrastructure work to be done but luckily all major lightning implementations have decent funding.

What a bullshit is this?
If I had a coinbase account and want to deposit BTC they'd give me a destination address. If later I transfer BTC to this address by myself or ask my Yakuza friend to send a payment doesn't matter at all. If some government body investigates, the transfer will be associated with my account.
Exactly the same would happen with a LN transaction. As LN works with payment requests that are one-time use, coinbase can keep the payment request to later prove that I or someone I ordered to do so, paid it.
Plus: If LN transaction were a problem for coinbase they wouldn't hire devs that can implement it into their system.
FUD!

well, btc will suceed because it is what it is and what many people are doing to improve it.
completely independent of that, people will invest money into it. that follows hype cycles and the halving. 9 months before the next halving prices are starting to rise, it will continue over the halving and then culminate in a big exagerated ATH around 1 year after the halving. you can find this out using the chart history.
and most people buy because price is high. not because they spend any minute researching what it is all about. that is what I concluded by observing this space long enough.

A few days ago the nodes were called lnd-01.lnstart.com, lnd-02.lnstart.com, lnd-03.lnstart.com.
Then they changed the names and 17 more nodes came online.
If all of them are supposed to put 20 BTC of capacity into the network then this actor alone supports the network with 400 BTC.
The numbers in the id strings are not continous. If that means they want to put more nodes online until the number range is complete from 1 to (currently) 42 then we might observe 800 BTC in LN soon.
That's brazen, reckless and awesome. :-D

All cool and I generally like Taaki's ideas ... however: Yesterday I observed this behavior on Bitfinex:
 * price was in the 3630-3600 range and looked it wanted to break out
 * suddenly a 400 BTC buy wall appeared around 3610 along with a 2000 BTC buy wall at 3650 BTC
 * price subsequently dropped to 3490 USD and took hours to get out of 35xx range again
 * presumably those whales snatched some cheap coins and are happy to be in todays small rally (we're in the 3700-3800s again)
So what I am saying is that massive manipulation can happen on the exchanges *anytime*. The higher the BTC price the smaller (and more insignificant) the impact of the individual average investor.
So if you spread BTC in Rojava all those people's saving are being put at risk of some BTC whales.
IOW, if you are able to sell 2000 BTC you can basically decide alone when the next crash happens.

If it were a state that had some track record of dealing well with currency I'd say: "OK, cool".
However venezuelan government forces people to use bolivars which became so worthless that people simply weigh them instead of counting. The government pretends inflation isn't real by refusing to issue bigger denominated notes.
Instead it puts people lives at risk because anyone who needs to buy something substantial has to carry huge bags or backpacks for transfering money which makes them targets of crime.
So, no. This government is corrupt and this Petro stuff is some kind of fraudulent scheme to avoid international sanctions.

Accepting all crypto is just a way for them receiving currency that has international value. Unlike bolivars you can trade bitcoin and many altcoins on the whole world.
Thanks to USDT and EURT you can then transfer money without having to think about sanctions.
The government is probably laughing crazily: A good chunk of the cryptocurrency community will be endeared by this government acceptance while all they want to do is escape the sanctions.
Btw: Are you guys going to cheer if North Korea allows to pay tourist trips to their country with cryptocurrency?
Btw2: Never ever tell *any* government that you own crypto. You might end up on a blacklist.

Some people might want that a potential hardfork is looming at the end of November...
I saw bitcoin price fall to ~1800 USD back in July when the UASF/Segwit2x/Bitcoin ABC shit hit the fan. The subsequent quick climb to the 2800s was most likely very profitable for some parties.
I am pretty sure some people would like to see a similar crash in November before it goes up to 5000 and more ...
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:54:37
For those who didnt observe it: Suddenly a buy order of around 2000 BTC appeared at around 7900 USD and then slowly moved up until 8140 USD (were it was completed). Price fell later on, of course, making this a rather weird way to spend 16M USD.
Why would anyone buy such a large amount in such a wasteful way?

works for both order types if you set the variables right.

How can you know that no spending is happening? Was there ever an economy in existance that used an economic setup like Bitcoin?
I'd rather say that people would think twice how they spend their oh-so-precious BTC and this could lead to a market with products that focus on sustainability: The more reliable, long-lasting, environmentally-friendly etc a product is, the higher the likelihood that someone flips a BTC for it.
Products that break after a short time, are costly to maintain, etc will have a hard time attracting HODLers ...

OK chart artists, fire up bitcoinwisdom, look at bitfinex, set to 1d columns and count how many days we saw green in a row? 6 days, great!
now scroll and find other timespans were btc was in the green multiple days. you'll see there a few only and 6days is really an exception.
so the likelihood that we'll see a drop today is IMO higher than that we see a continuation of the uptrend.

My 0.02$ about the current situation by comparing it to the past:
This is bitcoin's worst part of the bear market in 2014. Judging from the weekly RSI back in 2014 and the one we have today there is room to go lower.
I don't want to give an explicit price tag but something below the 3600$ we've already seen is likely and that it will happen within the next 3 months.
Here is a detailed chart from the worst week of last times' bear market (on bitstamp btw, on bitfinex it reached a slightly lower price later in the year):
As you can see the final moments are actually not very different from other bottoms. The difference will be the insane media coverage and doomsday predictions around that time causing stress and fear in all those who invested too much at a too high price and don't know much about bitcoin. Remember that causing people to sell allows others to buy in cheaply and there is no such thing as fairness amongst humans when it is about deceiving others.
If you are affected by that here are my suggestions:
1) If you don't know about the halving, the technical side of bitcoin (lightning, sidechains, etc) and you have little knowledge of trading patterns (e.g. bearish divergence): Don't think about bitcoin for the next 6-9 months. Don't read news and don't check your balance every day.
2) Take the time to inform yourself about LN, bitcoin's technical side and - if you are up to it - trading fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:25:00
A bear market needs a bottom before an uptrend kicks in again. Those who think it goes lower are just seeing an opportunity to stock on more BTC or squeeze some fiat out without minimizing their btc investment.
Imagine you sold 1 BTC for $6000 6 weeks ago.
If price reaches $3000 you could:
* buy two BTC
* buy one BTC and keep $3000 for whatever one needs fiat
Both is nice.
And no, those people riding the bear wave are probably not creating it. IMO the wave of uninformed panicking investors is much much stronger.

@_date: 2018-12-05 11:19:08
$2100-$2800 is reasonable. however before going there price will likely jump/dead-cat bounce once more (BTCUSDSHORT implies this).
WRT to "bear market low" I am observing weekly RSI and expect the price when the RSI is around 26 to be the bottom. 26 is what was reached in 2015's bear market.
I also expect that bottom to be revisited in 6-9 months. If its not broken for long (or not at all) and weekly RSI stays above 30 then its "bullish divergence" time.

I don't get the nervosity about mining difficulty decreasing: The difficulty adjustment algorithm works as intended and improves the chances to find a block for the remaining miners.
An unlimited growth of the mining capacity is neither desired nor healthy. Of course, it is a risky business investing in bitcoin mining during a bear market. However there was precedent how long such a situation can last and how low prices can be. Miners are supposed to make a proper economic calculation before ordering hundreds of machines.
