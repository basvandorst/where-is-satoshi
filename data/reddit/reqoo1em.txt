You'll get a passphrase with 24 words iirc, with which you can restore your wallet if the trezor/ledger should fail.

Well, I can only talk for Switzerland and I have seen people lose their savings when the "Sparkasse Thun" went to shits. Some got theyr money back (thanks to other banks hopping in), but many lost a fortune back then.

I gifted 1mBTC to some of my friends to undermine how it works, having them getting a wallet and now they are just happy the amount doubled since I gave it to them. They are also interested in the whole thing now, also checking the btc price tgemselfes now, from time to time :)

That absolutely underlines your personality perfectly. You should focus on succeeding yourselfes instead of hating on others on topics you have obviously no clue about.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:32:55
You are just being so small minded, I would be asking myself where you've gone wrong in your life. Got hit hard by one of the two bubbles you compare cryptos to I assume, than besides your obvious username theres no fucking reason to make the statements you are.
Youre saying I'm wrong, while being completely wrong yourselfes. You should invest your time in doing some research instead of preaching your assumptions and wrongbeings. 
It's hilarious and silly at the same time. 
I said I'm done with you before, gave you another chance nontheless and you have just proofen to be a stubborn grumpy waste of time, congratulations.
You may come back to me and get a reaction, but only after bitcoin is dead and yeah, Good Luck with that.

@_date: 2017-11-13 05:50:31
Has it ever occured to you that there might be different useful cryptos with different use cases?
Gold, diamonds and silver have absolutely no value aswell other then being shiny. The value has only simply risen as high as it did, cause people give these that value. Gold has risen many 100% the past 20 years, only because ppl believe in it as a store of value and theres only a fixed amount of it. And hey while were on it... Paper money has absolutely no fucking value aswell, and over 95% in curculation are only there because of dept. 
The vision is still there and the cryptos and especially the bitcoin are changing and going though constant evolution. And there are already ideas being worked on to scale it to a level of VISA, concerning the amount of transactions it can handle.
And on the other hand side, BTC would already do a good job as a store of value besides the current high volatility mostly due to tge fact that it is still in a very early adopter phase.
-including typos, written on mobile.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:01:13
That statement makes it even more obvious! Such a swing is nothing new and caused by just another attack on BTC. Gosh... Being clueless and still wanting to rant, this is also absolutely nothing new. People like you are annoying, to say the least.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:15:59
That means absolutely NOTHING, as long as you have obviously no fucking clue about cryptos.

First off, I'm to old to get called junior by you, wrong assumption n°1. I'm by far not only listening to fanboys, I'm always considering every side and opinion on a matter before I decide something, wrong assumption n°2. I would never go All-In on cryptos or risk my well being by any investement. I had a very deep dive into crypto, reading and watching stuff coming from very different opinions and based on my research and wealth i made an investement which might cost me all what I've put in it (I highly doubt that will happen sson though), but it also might make me some profit, we just don't know yet. And I'm in this primarely because I believe in Satoshis Vision and the tech backing it up.

Well, that doesn't really proof anything to be absolutely honest. Anyways, I'm eager to see what comes out of this.

I'm sure that cryptocurrencies and the blockchain principal WILL prevail for a very long time, I'm absolutely convinced. And one of the reasons for that is, that I haven't seen any plausible ways for getting rid of it completely, which today seems quiet impossible tbh. And also you couldn't give me one good reason, which I was asking you for. I don't say it will be bitcoin, but currently theres absolutely no doubt, concerning cryptos.
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:45:18

And this valid reason is what exactly? Chinese Exchanges going down for now? - Sorry but I think you still didn't get what this is all about, as long as if you were serious with your statement, which is hard to say for sure nowadays.

You really think unceratainty will stop cryptos? That will be flushed away with the broad adoption which is coming, just look at all the gliwing flashing signs that lead the way, like china Bannning exchanges, or historical bankers giving theyr 2 cents.

Tell that to any common person in the western world over the age of 40, that this is what he has to ho through to have his money stored as safe as possible. This is so far away from broad adoption, and it's one of the worrysome circumstances, looking forward to broader adoption of cryptos. It's a very long way to go, and yeah, currently only doable in the US :/

@_date: 2017-10-06 13:35:38
I guess that depends on the exchange. Usually there should only be the transaction fee from the blockchain itselfes, which you will see before you confirm the transaction.
The exchange fees usually are fot the trading part of the exchanges. But I'm far off from knowing the regulations for all the exchanges out there. But it should be easy to check for that for yourselfes, just to be 100% sure.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:59:14


As stated above.
Exchanges differ mostly from a lot of things. Exchange fees, Current Course, what coins they support, support itselfes and many more. Coinbase should be legit as I have made my own, good experiences there.
Otherwise I think you got most of it covered, and on the other hand, check the sidebar to your right here on reddit. You will find many useful FAQ's and Tutorials, about how to get started and do stuff in the cryptoworld the best, depending on your own needs :)
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:01:04
I don't have made my own experiences with it, but a friend of mine, which is in Crypto way longe then myselfes, uses it. And I think he didn't have any problems so far. - He also stores most of his coins on a ledger.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:47:05
Thank you for taking your time to share your concern. In my case there is no need to worry concerning savings, I've got enough and won't touch that. On the other hand side, I live in Switzerland and even though living costs are exorbitant over here, and I can only work part time, I'm currently making a lot more money than possibly most people over in Venezuela. And it seems to be very unhumalny dire over there, that hurts. By giving this person some bitcoin, I might be able to at least provide some meals for some, with knowing it's directly going to a person which is involved, without any middleman, approvals and still very much in time. I feel like it's the most I am currently able to help, and believe me I want to, even if it's not that much.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:53:07
I don't think so, but the ~12$ won't hurt me too much if hes a scammer; and if hes real, what I am assuming due to his postings, I might make the day for the guy. 100% worth it imho.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:01:29
It heavily depends on where you order it. I for example ordered mine in a little internetshop here in Switzerland, and they got it on stock.
I also said the paper wallet would be a very safe way to store you're coins (especially long term hodling, and bigger amounts) since we were talking about being secure.
And for a long time hodler, it's just the best option. I tell noone to take my humble opinion for granted, I just like to give answers in the best terms of my knowledge, which is far from professional. 
And yes, I would never ever leave a bigger amount of money in a place where you don't hold your own private keys. I'd like to see how you proof to coinbase that it wasn't you that transfered out the amount that got hacked ou of your coinbase wallet. It wouldn't be the first time, nor the last, and please don't think that you're 100% safe only because you use 2FA.
And I absolutely agree that it's not worth to get a 100$ wallet for an amount of 20$ worth of bitcoin, but that's for every single person to decide for themselfes in the end.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:28:25
Yes, that's very roughly how it works :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:24:09
I think we are almost on the same line of thought though :)
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:30:25
There are some possible explenations. I think the FOMO (fear of missing out) and the upcoming fork in november (ppl want to get as much free coins as possible) are the most plausible explenations. In the end, noone can tell you for sure :)

It's very interesting to see on how much she has turned her stance on crypto since the last years WEF.
There she talked about it as a non threat that she easily can handle by telling the public that it enables terror in first place and have it shut down for that, if it should ever pose a threat to the current banking system.
On a fast track through the stages mentioned by Andreas A.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:45:54
Yes, Coinbase is an exchange, you don't get to hold your private keys there, so it's literally not even your money.
Get yourselfes a Trezor or a Ledger Nano, buy the coins where you feel it's the best to do so (but inform yourselfes beforehand), Coinbase is fine imo, I used it some times aswell for quick buys with a CC.
As soon as you bought your coins, just transfer it over to your trezor and stack and hold it there, not much more to it. And the Setup for the Trezor is pretty self-explanatory. ( I currently only got a trezor since my ledger didn't get delivered yet, but from wht I've heard/read it's as good as Trezor and a little bit cheaper iirc).
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:24:20
So back on my PC, a bit more efficient with wording here ;)
I'm not a native english speaker aswell so, don't worry, looks perfectly fine to me.
So, just to be clear, what would your definitions for a currency exactly be, what points must something fulfill to be counted as currency? When I look it up, I see so many different opinions about that, I ain't even sure if there is a final made up defintion for a currency that counts as this world wide. Also I do agree with your points about the economical value to some degree, but the "real currencies" right now are also in a big turmoil of speculations, where usually the currency gambling does not have as much impact as political/eviromental happenings might have, since these currencies are mostly established for a very long time and the whole volume is just too big to really have a noticable impact on it. 
(Illegal Trading is currently mostly covered by $ in cash)
If you want/need to name an economical room for the Bitcoin, I think I would simply answer that question with, the internet. It's the money of the internet and it has a lot of followers (Altcoins), which also are mooning quiet hard, even though they didn't reach this astronomical heights yet, but hey, we are still in the "early adopter" phase, so there is so much more room to grow here. And if you look at the Value Gains over most of the top 10 Cryptos this year, almost all of them have gon up by multiple 100%.
Also there is a very big demand for what cryptos provide. Easy accessible, mostly decentralized, private, fast, cheap and global. After having gone through multiple fuck ups by big banks, having seen an uncountable amount of people lose all there saving in between hours, after seeing the crash from 2008 and it's consequences, you have to admit, there has to be something "better". And let's say Bitcoin - (because there are so many cryptos already with so many different goals, aspects and intentions) - does provide a lot or all of that. It provides what currencies are meant to do and much more. So in my eyes, why shouldn't it be a worthy currency, that is global and for everyone with internet access and a propper devise acessible, without giving out your personal details to anyone, and still you can be sure that when you send x to B and you put in the correct reciepent adress, that the amout will be there in a pretty specific amount of time, for whatever reason you are paying B. Currencies are in no way as stable as you say, Look what happened in SImbabwe, look what happens in Venezuela, what happens in India... Money suddenly loses all of it's value do to central banks printing it out like crazy and driving up inflation as never seen before. Everything you had stored in a Bankaccount is gone, in hours.
Bitcoin will in my honest opinion probably more be some kind of a store value like gold. In the end the market and the users will tecide what it will be used for and if it survives, becomes more valuable and less volatile, all of that the future will show, like I said, we are still in a very early phase of cryptos. (If bitcoin will survive, just to be clear, I say cruptocurrencies will be the thing in the future, but in no way I can tell if it's bitcoin any other or even multiple coins with different values)

Thank you very much for that statement, I didnt't even want anything from you, but this just somehow shows me in how desperate of a situation you guys are right now and that it seems to be very much worth the cause.
I'm sending you a bit more, but since I'm not really rich, I can't afford to send much more. But I really hope it helps the cause.

Cryptos can change adapt and scale. Usability is one aspect of cryptos that will get way easier over time. Like it already did from 2009 up until now. And the broader the adoption, the faster it will evolve as a whole.

@_date: 2017-10-06 13:04:12
I can totally recommend a hardware wallet like:
- Trezor
- Ledger Nano
I would not in any way keep your holdings on an exchange, since it's not even close to be as safe as the above mentioned and the worst part, you don't get hold of the private keys! (most important detail of your wallet)
I'ts for sure better to keep them on your mobile, since you get your own private keys, and have absolute control over ist, but it's still way more unsafe than the above mentioned.
Best regards and Good Luck with your holdings!
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:13:15
Well, your wallet is only as safe as your PC is, and as long as you run windows as OS, I would say, that's not too safe. You could also generate paper wallets, which would be very safe and cheap aswell. Ofc it depends on the amount, and your gut feeling also. Just do what you feel the best about, but if you don't regularely trade with it, keeping it on an exchange is an unnecessary risk imho.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:12:42
Coinbase is probably one of the easiest ways. You will have some fees though, which you would able to evade, buying over GDAX (with ur coinbase login). You will find tutorials for this on youtube. Sorry I'm only on my mibile currently.

@_date: 2017-10-06 15:42:55
You could simply transfer it back to Coinbase if you got the urge to exchange it for USD (you gotta pay the transaction fee for the blockchain, as you do for every transaction there - BTC). Which wouldn't take too long usually, depends on how many confirmations are actually needed.
