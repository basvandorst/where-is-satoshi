A decentralized cryptocurrency backed by gold is a specific and specialized case. Lets generalize it to a decentralized cryptocurrency that proves ownership. When I say decentralized, I'm referring to the network to verify transactions is decentralized. Anybody that downloads the client can be part of the network. The block chain is an open ledger that contains all of the transactions. If I have a private key, that means I can prove ownership of something, whether it is gold or anything else. If you and I do a personal trade, anybody can prove that I transferred ownership to you because they see it on the blockchain. You can verify you own that "thing" because you have the private key to it. Anybody can own "things" and the ownership is not centralized. How people trade in and out
of the cryptocurrency is up to the end user, whether it is through an exchange or person to person in real life. At this point the Bitcoin technology isn't being used as a "currency", so it might be better to give it another name other than Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.
**Edited** for spelling.

Try this in a terminal window. Replace BITCION_ADDRESS_HERE with the address you want to send to.  Replace AMOUNT_HERE with the amount. Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your api key.  I haven't tried it myself, but it should be close to what you need.
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d ' {"transaction": { "to": "BITCOIN_ADDRESS_HERE", "amount": "AMOUNT_HERE", "notes": "Sample transaction for you"}}'

From a BSD/Unix/Linux command line terminal.  Mac OSX also has a terminal application.  Find it under spotlight.  If you are using Windows, you'll need to install cygwin or something equivalent.

It took a lot of convincing to get Bitcoin listed on the sidebar and even then they were hesitant to do so.

Alternative cryptocurrencies can coexist as long as they offer advantages over BTC. Remember that Facebook wasn't the first social network. Facebook exists today because they did social networking better than AOL, myspace, etc.  
One advantage for LTC is that is has a faster transaction time of 2.5 minutes compared to 10 minutes for BTC.
For more comparisons between BTC and LTC, see:

the version of curl you are using doesn't support https.  Check that your version was compiled with SSL.

The community should keep the Bitcoin wiki up to date.  I'll try to update the timeline as time permits.
