Could the closed door meeting between the miners and Blockstream be the reason for this price drop?  I think so, I don't think investors like closed door meetings.  I also think that many investors think on-chain scaling is the way forward.

One simple thing you can do is run a full node.

As we all know, the blockchain is being spammed with transactions right now.
How do you know that?  Where is the proof?  Wouldn't it also make sense that these are all legit transactions and there is simply not enough space for them?

Fair enough.  I think that it is a fair bet that he has a wildly different interpretation of the contract.  To me, thinking that the sun revolves around the earth places a person's judgement in doubt.  It isn't a religious belief, it is being obtuse in the face of overwhelming facts.

It is possible that he left the password on the mining machine as default.  I suggest connecting a computer on the same network and doing a network scan to see what other IP addresses are on the network.  This is a good free IP scanner [Link](  You should set it to show what devices respond to port 80, i think it is set that way by default, check the manual.
After you know what IP address on the network respond to port 80, enter each of them into a web browser.  One of them will be the miner.  Check to see who the manufacturer is and what the default password is set to from the factory.  If it is the default password, you are in luck, you can check to see what mining pool he is pointing to.  You can then contact the mining pool and request access to his account assuming you don't know the password.

I went cheap on the VPSs and only got 512MB on them.  I am using the swap as extra memory.  Not the best solution, but the disks are SSDs and it has been fine.  I know it is a low amount of RAM, I am hoping I can get by for a year with 1GB total.

When you first set up your wallet on your phone it gave you a string of words and asked you to write them down.  This is your "seed" if you have it you should be able to recover your coins.  
"To avoid losses from lack of backups, such wallets tend to use a single bitcoin address for all transactions. HD wallets instead use a «master seed» (a number based on the 12 random words in Mycelium’s case), to derive all future bitcoin addresses sequentially, with each new address created by appending a counter to the end of the seed."
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:17:56
I hope you have a backup of the seed.  USB drives are notoriously unreliable.  Keep a encrypted copy someplace else.  I store encrypted backups on my Google Drive.

You can use this place to run a node for $13 a year - [Crissic Solutions](  
They have a promotion going and they take BTC.  Select OVZ512YEAR, and at check out it will be $13 even though the page above says $36.  The VPS has: / 512MB RAM with 512 swap/ 3 CPU Cores / 100GB SATA Disk / 2TB Bandwidth
I run two nodes from there with the same specs [Example](  However, the memory is a bit low, when downloading the blockchain it will run out of RAM.  I just checked on it and kept it going.  You can also try running with -disablewallet to decrease memory usage.  Once the blockchain is downloaded it runs fine.
