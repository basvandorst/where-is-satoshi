I work in torrance, live in Hermosa. I would absolutely use BTC for my subway purchases!

Aw common dude, don't take advantage of it. What that other kid did was great, and in his defense did have proof. I mean I have $100,000 in student debt, you don't see me begging reddit.

You are the future the world needs, I hope I would have done the same thing in your position. Go to college, get a good degree, and do well for yourself. And as another said, this wouldn't be a bad thing to write about in a college admission essay!

I live in Hermosa which is a bit too far for me to really drive just for a subway sandwhich, but when one starts doing it closer to me ill go! Keep it up!

This crash happened while ppl should have been been sleeping in China, I doubt much of it was caused by them. They should just be waking up now and it still isn't dropping much, which just makes me more confidant it is mostly Americans causing this.

I usually just reference bitstampUSD on here, it correlates to coinbase's price well:
