Many exchanges are still not using Segwit. This would be a great first step :)

I thought it only mattered if you were sending from a segwit address. So how much does this matter?

Bloomberg the new CNBC?

Actually, since Bitcoin doesn't seem to be converging to a price for the "long term", we have no idea the cost of power to profit long term. Obviously cheaper power implies more profit so you still have a point.
I think mining centralization lies with manufacturers and inner circles possibly using the newest graphics cards that are not yet released to the public.

Well, I think the biggest point to make here is that a market cap of 19 trillion dollars does not mean that 19 trillion dollars has to be spent on Bitcoin. There is a multiplier effect here and I believe the outcome is more driven by supply and demand than simply exchanges holding the worth of Bitcoin's market cap in fiat.
