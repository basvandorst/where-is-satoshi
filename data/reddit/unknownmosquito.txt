I guess, but then it's like I'm buying an investment for the person.. it's something I might do for a nephew or niece (I have an uncle who always bought me bonds) but for anyone else (or certainly for *everyone* like the OP says) I feel like Christmas is about more personal gifts. Anything that must be exchanged for something else to be of value (I feel like gift cards fit in this category too) is kind of a crappy gift for a close friend or relative.

Personally I was interested in seeing the continuous packaging, I don't know about you.

Only to the dumb ones. A whole new market will open up with opportunities for marketing, market niches, and a clientele that's happy to be able to buy their drugs at the supermarket instead of a sketchy friend-of-a-friend's apartment.
This is especially true for pot. Sure, the price will bottom out for everyday Mexican ditchweed, but as growers hold tightly to their carefully bred hydro plants, every brand will offer a slightly different experience, and the prices will reflect that. If someone breeds a great high and can market that you're getting your money's worth if you pay more, they'll make a fortune *when* pot is legalized.

What does this have to do with Bitcoin?

I've thought of this, but as far as its being a gift is concerned this is the same as getting someone cash... which is a little tacky if you ask me.

I think your link indicates that they weren't *strangely* quiet at all. It seems pretty clear to me; Bitcoin is new legal territory and they don't want a lawsuit, end of story.
