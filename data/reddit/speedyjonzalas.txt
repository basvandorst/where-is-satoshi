Most uk banks use sepa. Just use that  to go to kraken.
@_date: 2014-05-05 10:29:36
Yup every time I send to kraken from bank of scotland it takes less than 4 hours which is amazing.
@_date: 2014-07-01 11:45:30
I posted the reason further down in the comments.

As the guy said above 2fa is only effective if you enable on email as well. Outwitted
Otherwise it's fairly easy to hack the email and send a 2fa cancel request to the exchange to get the coins out. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 08:42:01
You use 2FA with your email as well and then no problems.

I joined yesterday deposited euros from a uk account and it was there in a matter of hours.
Just put my first order up so it will be interesting to see how it goes. 
Two things though:
1) I am not a massive fan of the graphs. I like the one easy to read graph on btc-e.com but with kraken despite the extra graphs I just find the website a bit clunky, especially on my mobile.
2) I use 2FA but is there a way to use the same 2fa for logins/withdrawals and placing orders? It seems like you need to set a whole new one up for the ordering side of things.
All in all though I do like them, plus I've been keen on getting away from btc-e.com for a while now. Hopefully in time kraken can get some more volume.
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:04:01
Thanks.  I forgot to mention that orders over $50 will be free shipping.  Hope that helps a bit!

The only thing you said was it was like mark opened a new exchange which was nonsense as he has nothing to do with coinjar. You could have given some facts over a couple of sentences rather than give cryptic comments that don't make any sense.
I'd really appreciate if you could just give me the low down and link to facts. This forum is littered with people spouting comments without providing real evidence hence why you have received the negative response.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:51:23
Im not too sure.
I have been a bit busy this week to follow up on it. I'm guessing he is the majority shareholder but we dont know how many other shareholders there are.
Its got me thinking though as like you say he is essentially the owner, and the company is not public, it is private.
I wonder - at what point is a private company able to hide behind the limited liability side of things. 
Eg I understand a small company worth $1 million still needing collateral for the bank but once a company has income/revenue in the hundreds of millions does it become a semi public company and entirely limited liability?
@_date: 2014-03-03 21:01:18
I don't think you understand. 
I think we all agree that 'could' happen but the low amount of cases of this outcome occurring says otherwise.
Courts are generally very unwilling to do this hence why I think this type of attack is borderline pointless. 
To me it stinks of a law firm taking advantage of people who don't have a great knowledge in law. They let them know what could happen but in all likelihood it won't and the people who lost their coins will lose cash a second time round. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:41:37

Are you guys in Aus?
Im hoping they arnt being blocked on purpose from ou gov or something.

Why on earth would you let your company be run into the ground like this. Seriously, the last few weeks have been crazy with people refusing to acknowledge that they were in massive trouble. What more can they do short of come to your house and physically rob you?

Thanks I will check out out. When first investing I was having real trouble as there was few places to go to. (Despite having uk and aus accounts). Happy to see we have some options now. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 03:08:30
Yeah I think it costs me around 10 pounds but I'm fine with that as I had put in larger amounts. 
Each time I have transferred it has gone into Kraken within a few hours (My bank processes all SEPA at 3pm and its always there within a few hours). 
My only problem is Kraken 'holding' my payments when they come in for 24 hours or so due to their system. (Which annoys the hell out of me).
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:31:30
Being from Scotland (Though now in Aus) I wouldnt say we have a huge amount of chance in it becoming a bitcoin hotbed.
I'm not saying Scotland isn't advanced or technologically well equipped because it is in a massive way. The problem is that very few people over there know about it, or even consider it beyond something they very rarely see in the news.
As an example, I have spoken to my family on multiple occurrences about it over the last 16 months. My mum and dad are quite happy to invest in 'safe' stocks, while my brother and sister come from reasonably high level financial and languages backgrounds. I spoke to them all when the price was $340 and said to at least buy one, just for fun and explained my reasoning plus graphs etc to back it up. Only my parents bought one, while my siblings barely replied. I sent a text to my parents this week saying congrats to around a 30% return in a month and they didnt respond (albeit they have been busy).
For this reason I just don't see Scotland as being the proving ground. The proving ground is going to be progressive cities in the US, along with other majors such as NY, Melbourne, other European cities etc.

My letter to NAB - will update when they respond.
Hi there,
I was following the article at  and would like to know if this is a one off stance or if this will be applied nationwide against every business who accepts bitcoins as a payment method.
As someone who has considerable knowledge on crypto currencies I find it hard to believe that NAB would make such a move prior to the ATO's tax ruling which is due in the near future. (Especially considering the UK &amp; USA have both acknowledged them with specific tax rulings)
It also saddens me as I specifically stayed with NAB as you were seen as having a very fair view on dealings with bitcoin. 
If this is NAB's stance I will likely be moving all of my family's accounts to another bank, one who is willing to help small businesses grow and utilise every available avenue to help increase revenue.
This not only affects my accounts, but it is going to have serious effect on any advice I give to clients and friends in the near future. Should my clients and friends require advice on whom to bank with I will point them to any other bank bar NAB.
I hope NAB reconsiders their stance on crypto currencies (if this article is true) so I can continue to use your services. If not, then I believe you will be pushing a significant portion of your market away. 
Perhaps instead of being the bank who jumps the gun and looks like a fool later on you could promote crypto currencies as the future and be seen as a leader.

Hi everyone, please check out my wife's baby/toddler clothing shop.
Completely customisable, just let us know your ideas!
Payments will be processed through Coinjar, with 20% off the listed prices when paying with Bitcoin. (Not including postage - orders over $50 are free WORLDWIDE / single orders from $6 worldwide) 
We will deduct the discount before invoicing - just select the other payments option and we will get back to you asap.
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:07:34
Well the ATO guidelines are only that - guidelines.
If you expect it to break within a year then it would seem fair to write it off in that year.
Also, if you say 2 years expected useful life then the calculation is 200/2 which is 100% so either way it will be full written off. (Although the depreciation is pro rata'd from the day it was bought so you may only get a portion of the deduction this year and the rest in the next year.)

Can we do anything to help here? I understand banks may be hard to get through to but could we donate to a bitcoin fund to which the zoo could then exchange for supplies?
I will cross post this to doge as well as they are always good at getting these things going though I hold no doge coins.
~~I dont know the standard method of setting up these sort of donations funds but would be willing to donate 0.1 BTC to help out.~~
~~Can anyone offer up some ideas? (And possibly get someone who is vouchable for the community to hold the coins or set it up - I'd be happy to do it myself but don't want people put off through the threat of scams.)~~
Edit: I'm away to study for a bit. I'l check back in an hour and hopefully this will have gained some traction.
**Edit 2: As noone came forward I have set up a new donation address here: 19rGfGCeHcYfdBTsQ6HN8iqHGDy1hwjcqM**
I will wait a day or two then transfer the cash out through coinjar and and then transfer all proceeds to  - I understand if people are wary of donating to an 'unknown' on here so I'd be happy to hear some suggestions of how I can verify myself. (Perhaps through mods etc as I dont want to give personal info to everyone). Also, I have just donated 0.1 myself to get the ball rolling which should come through in a few minutes.
Update: back up and noticed a couple of small donations which is great. I'm working the next 8 hours or so then I will post proof of donating the first portion.
**Ony a couple of small donations but better than nothing conisdering we didnt manage to find someone to take the lead. Im having trouble verifying my coinjar account so will need to forward them off to another account before i can transfer them to cash and verify the donation. I'l update when this goes through**

If Japanese law is anything similar to UK or Aus law then this is a very, very unlikely outcome.
Rarely would a court 'lift the corporate veil' and take money from the CEO to repay those whom the company owes money.
The whole point to a company is limited liability. In turn, it is very difficult to do this sort of thing. Good luck to them but in my view the law firm sees money to be made and nothing else.

It was announced by NAB a while ago that they were no longer supporting businesses associated with bitcoin so it's no surprise to me that they closed it. Even Coinjar have had reroute their deposits through a third party processor now, which despite the extra time it takes to deposit, is probably a good thing seeing as how stupid Australian banks are.
I spoke to the guy at NAB a while ago about it and have copy pasted it below. Since then I have convinced many people to move their business away from NAB, even non-bitcoiners. Everyone should do the same.
*I had the pleasure of talking to NAB in Australia recently as they had pulled support of businesses dealing with bitcoins.*
*The guy I spoke to seemed reasonably high up and I explained that I would be pushing all of my clients to other banks now as they are clearly unwilling to move with the times.*
*He explained it was due to NAB not wanting to take the risk of allowing businesses to use bitcoin. I explained that there was absolutely no risk on their part as every bitcoin business deals with it themselves and should understand the security and safety aspects before getting into it. I also said that this would push a huge amount of business away from NAB in the future, and the void will be easily filled by another group who are going to be pro-active about their clients businesses.*
*It was a strange conversation and I'm annoyed I didn't post about it straight away (It was a month or so ago when I was very busy with deadlines). I got the strong feeling that he was pro bitcoin as he agreed with nearly everything I said and really couldnt say much as to their reasoning other than 'risk'. His argument was very, very weak and he knew it. When I asked if it has just been a case of the board putting their foot down he didnt say much...*
*If anything positive came from the conversation it was that there was a good chance the guy I spoke to was pro-bitcoin. These are the people who will be running the banks in the future. They dont have the power yet but given some time the banks should come around.
For now though, maybe open an account away from your main income stream account (in another bank/credit union) and especially away from the account you use to pay your mortgage.*

Yes I'm fairly sure it is everywhere as that is what she has listed on the original Etsy listings (the $50 shipping offer wasn't so much a bitcoin offer as an offer to every payment type). Where about are you based so I can check with my wife in the morning?

Im not sure how the US works but most countries work on a marginal tax system. Eg your tax rate goes up as your income goes up. 
Now say your income was 50k and you had a loss of 3k your income would be reduced to 47k. 
However you dont get that back, you only get a portion of it back at your marginal tax rate. So say you marginal tax rate is 20% you would only get 20% of 3k back ($600) not the full amount. On top of this you can only get a refund on any tax you paid during the year - so if you havnt paid any tax during the year then you cant get anything back.
This is also assuming you can apply capital losses against normal income - most countries only let you apply capital losses against other capital gains (shares etc).
Im assuming you are in the US so it may be different over there but most countries tend to work on the system as described above.

This has been my experience as well. Due to their system placing deposits on hold I lost out on 0.4 bitcoin last week. They need to address this issue asap.
Before anyone asks, I was well under deposit limits, the deposit was not for the same amount as previous times and I used the exact same bank and sepa transfer details as previous deposits. 
They were very slow at getting back to me and didn't even apologise. 
This has happened twice now. Once I don't mind but twice is a joke. They won't even acknowledge that their is a problem with their system.
Edit: I have asked them on their sub - reddit here 
@_date: 2014-04-08 11:55:32

I will be writing to NAB to explain that this stance will force me to change banks. 
I trade very little bitcoin through my NAB account but I have prospective businesses that could have been. 
What surprises me even more is that they are doing this prior the to the Aus Tax Office ruling on bitcoin. I could understand doing this after the ATO gave a damning tax ruling (which there is very little chance of happening) but doing it before is stupid. 
Everyone, please write to NAB and let them know that as a customer you will be seriously considering moving banks.
@_date: 2014-02-27 10:08:28
Ah right, I was just a bit confused by the wallet that was apparently bitstamps (or another exchanges, I cant recall who) that had 750k coins.
@_date: 2014-02-24 12:46:41
Australian Tax Accountant here.
I havn't looked into the buying/selling of coins as of yet and whether they are classed as income or capital (Although at a guess it would be capital) but I can answer your other two points.
The ATO (Aus Tax Office) has a depreciation table which is used for businesses to calculate a suitable depreciation rate for any assets they may own. Usually for computers we say 4 years which when run through the ATO rulings would mean a depreciation rate of 50%. (200/4, with 200 being the standard figure the ATO use.)
Also, if you class your business as an SBE (Small Business Enterprise) which the majority of us would, (You need turnover to be less than 2million to qualify) you can get a write off of any assets you buy that cost less than $6500 immediately. However this ruling has been recently reduced to $1000 from 1 Jan 2014.
As for light and power, there is multiple ways of doing so, for example using the floor area that your 'business' takes up in your home and including this as your % to claim certain expenses. To be honest though as the space would likely be very small I would probably try and estimate the actual energy the computer equipment uses. This isnt a normal way to estimate your business electricity fees but I reckon the ATO would be quite happy providing you can show your workings. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:40:19
Firstly, the 'owners' of the company are the shareholders. Your father was likely the majority shareholder (or possibly the only shareholder) so that would be why you lost the house. In recent times the limited liability side of running a private company has been reduced as too many people were creating companies, running up large debts and getting away scot free. 
With big public companies, banks will hold loans that have priority over other creditors so if the company folds they should still get some cash back. 
Hence the term limited liability - the shareholders only lose their share value and nothing else. 
This also applies to the head management as they were just doing their job, albeit in a bloody awful manner. You only have to look in the news and on a weekly basis the CEO's of major companies get away with crazy shit and to top it all off they tend to walk away with a golden handshake instead of a beating.
Sorry you lost your house - banks are evil in the way they take peoples assets when things go poorly.

@_date: 2014-03-05 07:06:29
I'm not too sure if it's possible on yahoo.
For this very reason I would open a Gmail account and run anything important through it.
Have 2fa set up so it only recognizes your computer as safe access. That way noone can log in and email an exchange asking them to remove 2fa on the exchange. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:26:42
No it wouldnt.
It would likely sit in that account until they found an answer for it appearing there.
The process they went through is essentially creating and then reversing entries to prove the balance exists.
Also remember auditors work on materiality with materiality for such a large company likely being in the hundreds of bitcoins. Eg anything below a few hundred coins would be ignored by the auditor as it's a waste of time chasing after such low value amounts. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:59:57
Mark has nothing to do with coinjar. If you use them purely to buy and sell coins then you are fine. Just don't store any there.

As someone with an audit background, on one hand I am very happy that Kraken is moving in this direction (Especially as I have some interest in there atm).
However, the idea of an independent cryptographically-verified auditor causes me to question the value of an audit done by a/one person who has ties to our industry.
Perhaps I have read it wrong so hopefully someone can correct me but on reading the audit report I feel it lacks the wording and professional judgement a qualified auditor would use.
In my view the ONLY way for this to be a truly independent audit and especially for exchanges of this size is for there to be a 'cryptographically-verified auditor' working along side a professionally qualified audit/accounting firm.
Yes, this may be a bit too 'regulated' for the bitcoin group but to me this is the only way forward. If anyone agrees with my view I would like to hear your comments as I may move this idea forward to help the community. (I would have little to gain from this, I just want bitcoin to become a bit more stable against the numerous cowboy exchanges.)
