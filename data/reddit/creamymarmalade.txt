Bought a first batch KnC Saturn. Made more than I invested pretty quickly. 
I'm still running it and it does cover its own electricity cost. But not much more.

I'm having a hard time imagining how I would react if I didn't know about bitcoin. Being who I am, I wouldn't think much about the chocolate though. That I'm sure of. If the encounter went like "Here, have a chocolate bar and a brochure. Have a nice day!". I've been given free things and/or candy by a wide range of different companies before. But that's only what I feel ofc. Perhaps people in general react differently.

He's also 54 years old and has 5 decades of experience in business. He must have been an impressive 4-year-old.

I couldn't find anything about Klarna having decided not to integrate bitcoin in the near future. Maybe they'll make a statement soon.
As of now, the only official word on it I've found (from their swedish homepage etc.) is that they're investigating it. Bitcoin is not listed as a payment option in their FAQ or demo store.

Wrong, 30% of people will order the first mining product they see advertised. 20% will order from the top google search hit. 16% will CPU-mine for two weeks before giving up on bitcoin. 4% will GPU-mine for fun. The remaining 30% will order whatever they can find on ebay.

Not commenting on what she said here. But in general, if the contents of what is said makes sense and is great advice, it doesn't matter if even a 5-year-old said it.

The artist is Rodolfo Damaggio and the art is based on *In the Heart of the Sea*. Don't know if it's just painted as a fan of the book, or as concept art for the movie adaption coming next year. Damaggio has done work for film before.

That feels like something only other business men would think.

Yep. Just wild guesses being thrown around.

Hmm. 3 reasons. A triangle has 3 edges.... One is the tip. Eyes.

Yeah it can be divided further. 100 satoshis equal 1 bit. A satoshi is the smallest you can go.
