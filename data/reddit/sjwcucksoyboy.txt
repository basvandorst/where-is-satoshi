The thing is 1% of your users is not going to use bitcoin, like I said very few people actually use Bitcoin. But also you have to factor credit card fees against the fees to convert your bitcoin into dollars. Because you'll want your bitcoin to be converted to dollars since bitcoin is pretty unstable.

When people say "Bitcoin is for drugs and terrorism" they say that because that seems to be all it's used for besides speculation. The dollar is used soo much more for illegal activity than Bitcoin but it actually have a shit ton of other uses.

I don't see why this whole "investors die inside seeing bitcoin do well" thing came from but whatever. Investors don't care that much about Bitcoin, if they cared they'd be investing in it. If they want those kind of returns they could just buy option calls.

Yes it absolutely is crazy. There's a big difference between something being worth nothing and then all of a sudden gaining traction and reaching a market cap of over a trillion dollars. For Bitcoin to go to 100 mil it'd be worth over a quadrillion dollars, that doesn't even make sense

Dear lord this is a stupid reply. The whole point of the Eron comparison is to show that holding isn't always a good idea and an asset can reach record highs and then crash and never recover. It's basically saying that Bitcoin could follow the path of Enron, it's to show what Bitcoin could do in the future so why the fuck do you think it's smart to say that Bitcoin isn't currently worthless? It would be like if someone told you that if you keep smoking you might die from smoking like the Marlboro Man, and your reply was "the difference between me and the Marlboro Man is I'm not dead".

When I got there I couldn't find it and the guy said they removed it 2 weeks ago because not many people were using it. I feel like in 2 years time there will be &lt;5000 Bitcoin ATMs, not that many people buy Bitcoin and an even smaller number of people use Bitcoin ATMs.

The difference is the majority of people aren't using the USD or any other currency exclusively for the purpose of trading. The price of the USD doesn't wildly fluctuate day to day because people don't primarily own it so they can sell it when the price goes up. And I don't really care if it technically is considered a currency it doesn't have the right properties to be considered a useful currency, hence why no one uses it as one. It's price is too volatile and it doesn't have enough adoption to really be considered a currency. 


You really missed what I was getting at. I'm talking about guys who own Bitcoin primarily as an investment but used it to buy pizza or other dumb things as a novelty very infrequently. I'm not talking about the original pizza that's worth 30 quintillion dollars now or whatever

I feel like the Ron Paul fans that like Gold don't know how to use Twitter
@_date: 2019-11-06 23:21:47
We both know that Bitcoin fluctuates wildly in the context of being a currency so this argument is just annoying and pointless. I don't really care how much the USD fluctuates in the context of a FOREX trading I'm talking about whether or not Bitcoin is a currency so the context we should be talking about is how the fluctuation impacts it's usage as a currency. And clearly the fluctuation of the price of the USD doesn't impact it's usage as a currency that much, while the fluctuations of Bitcoin impact it heavily. No vendors are abandoning the USD because the value of the USD just fluctuates too much. And people actually set the prices of things in USD, no one says this pizza costs 0.00084252 bitcoin or whatever and it has the same price consistently. No if you buy something in Bitcoin they set the price of that item in USD and then calculate how much bitcoin it's worth for every transaction.

Bitcoin is shit at all those things, by the same logic if I manage to trade Facebook stock for a car then Facebook stock is a currency. It's too volatile to be a good store of value or unit of account and no one uses it so it's a shit medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-11-06 21:12:15
Can we stop pretending like Bitcoin is a currency? It's so fucking obvious that Bitcoin is almost exclusively used as an investment if you've spent any time around crypto nerds and yet people pretend like because they bought a pizza with Bitcoin a year ago for the novelty it's a currency.
@_date: 2019-11-06 22:24:38

I really fail to see the point of these bitcoin VISA cards. So you buy bitcoin with fiat and then convert your bitcoin back to fiat to spend. It's basically just spending fiat with more steps but each of those steps involves getting fucked by fees. What tangible benefit does it give you? It's not like it even promotes adoption cause it doesn't encourage merchants to adopt bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-29 23:56:17
Time for the usual cycle for whenever a business supports bitcoin. If you're lucky you'll get some people using it at first but that'll stop pretty soon, and then no one will be using bitcoin so eventually even though you'll still technically support it none of the employees will know how to process Bitcoin.

It's not impossible to think Bitcoin will overtake fiat just so unlikely it's foolish to believe in. For one it's unlikely Bitcoin could actually scale to be able to handle 5% of the economy, it doesn't seem like LN is going to be some magic solution that will make Bitcoin scale infinitely so we'd need another magic solution to come along. But even if Bitcoin could scale to handle that load there's no real reason to use it over fiat for almost everyone. It's good for illegal activities and being cheaper than wire transfers but that's a very small part of the economy.  Fiat works and there's no reason to stop using it for normal uses. Being trustless really doesn't matter, and there's a lot of advantages to being able to trust institutions. But even if Bitcoin was very useful it's going to need the government's approval if it hopes to reach 5% adoption.
@_date: 2019-12-16 21:52:53

These cope posts are really annoying. These lines are arbitrary, there's no reason to think that just because you've drawn some lines bitcoin stays between that means you've discovered a trend that is likely to hold. This is the laziest form of analysis out there.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:24:29


There's no reasearch out there that just says "LN will scale to billions of people without making massive assumptions about how the system will scale". This is silly.


Yes but not everyone will be able to open a channel that month, that means the queue of people trying to open a channel will slowly expand. You are right tho I was somewhat wrong about my assumption you'd have to wait a month, although if the queue starts expanding it could be more than a month.


By centralized I mean we're going to get the spoke and hub model. If people generally open just one channel then the only system that would really work without having stupidly long number of nodes to jump through is the spoke and hub model.


Okay lets talk about why I don't think getting paid via lightning network is going to work. Generally people save some money, they don't spend all of their money every paycheck. So that means more money is going to be flowing to you than away from you. That means you will have to repeatedly open new channels whenever the funds are all going one way. Also it might just be difficult to find someone willing to open a channel with you the size of your paycheck.


This shit is potential solutions, you're acting like it's a guaranteed thing. Also this research also makes a lot of assumptions. Also no research you have can show that people will be fine doing on chain transactions every 2 months or that LN won't run into a lot of other problems. There are still a lot of unknowns about LN and it's ability to scale. You seem to consistently overestimate how much your "research" will allow you to predict the future.

@_date: 2019-12-10 16:43:42
I really don't get why Bitcoiners think that the lack of 3rd party trust is so important. For one you often have to trust 3rd parties with Bitcoin, you have to trust 3rd parties when you buy Bitcoin off an exchange (which goes wrong all the time) and have to trust that when you send 3rd parties Bitcoin they'll actually deliver on your agreement. But also most people don't care about trusting 3rd parties as long as the 3rd parties are reliable and give you a good end product. People would rather trust banks then have a situation with Bitcoin where if you fudge the address you just send money into the ether and there's no recourse if you get hacked. I really don't see why many people would consider the lack of 3rd parties so important they'd be willing to take on the numerous downsides associated with Bitcoin.
Edit: Also even if Bitcoin was a bit better I still think it's crazy to think that it'll lead to the collapse of the banking system in our lifetime. For one the banks would probably adopt to Bitcoin if it was really a thread but banks have so much institutional momentum it'd be hard to kill them off. There's been a lot of technologies that have been technically better but failed because they weren't good enough to beat the momentum the old system had.
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:04:18


How? Why do people keep pretending like Bitcoin is so different from other assets that traditional investment advice doesn't work. It's an asset that is traded freely and the demand for it causes the price to fluctuate, sounds like a normal asset.

@_date: 2019-12-19 01:03:47
Yeah you're right about Bitcoin being a different asset class. Although being a different asset class doesn't mean you do away with traditional investment strategies. 


Seriously? Bitcoin isn't even close to being the most active project ever, it doesn't come close to stuff like the Linux kernel. By what metric is Bitcoin more active than the Linux kernel? 


I've read a lot about Bitcoins eco-system, that's why I bash it lol. Like at first I was quite excited about it but as I looked into it more and more I realized it was massively over-hyped within the Bitcoin community. Oh but I'm sure I haven't looked into it enough and if I read more Bitcoin news then I'd see the light. 
And the rest of what you said basically seems to be "a lot of people are working on Bitcoin so it'll be wildly successful" which is wishful thinking. There's a lot of projects that a lot of smart people work on that don't take over the world, Bitcoin has already been very successful but it seems silly to think it'll be useful for everyone, or even many people. 


It's not hard to see why so many people are enthusiastic about Bitcoin, it's driven by greed, ideology, and utopian thinking. Although very little of it is driven by an actual need for Bitcoin, Bitcoin now is mostly a solution in search of a problem.
Edit: I might be being a little unfair to Bitcoin, it has had some luck in finding problems it can be a solution for recently.

@_date: 2019-12-05 01:02:27
Yeah that's kinda my point. Bitcoin isn't fundamentally any different from other assets but you'd never make a post like this about any other asset.

Did you literally stop reading after I asked that question? I mean I clearly explained why your answer is stupid, but you've failed to address my criticisms of your answer at all. I'll try again and hope you make it past the first sentence, why should we include the increased cost of goods in our inflation figure? The FED printing money isn't the reason why rent prices are going up so why would we include that in our inflation figure in this context?
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:06:14


That's essentially scaling infinitely, and it seems crazy to me you think it's "rather clear" it will be able to do that soon considering how beta and unproven LN is. One big problem is that it still has to settle on the main blockchain, it's just deferred. And the main blockchain really can't do that many transactions per second, lets say we get it up to 20 tps, that's still only 52 million transactions per month. That's a lot, unless you have over a billion users. Then people would have to wait months to open a single channel. 


Instant finality is bad. People don't like the idea that a hacker can clear out your life savings because you got a computer virus or something and you're just fucked. 
Inflation really doesn't matter much to most people, Bitcoiners vastly overstate how terrible it is, but it's kinda important for a functioning economy to incentivize investment.
And I don't really get what you mean by counterparty risk? How's there a lot of counterparty risk when sending money? 


Well for one people still have to pay taxes in their national currency, so it'd be hard to get up to 5% adoption if you need to convert to your currency every time you want to pay taxes. Also the government would just stomp down on Bitcoin way before it got to 5% of the economy, the government doesn't want a large part of the economy to be unregulated. And I know what you're going to say that the government can't stop Bitcoin but 5% of the economy isn't going to be in an illegal currency.

My problem isn't that your bullish but you're adding on to the silliness of Bitcoin culture. I wish Bitcoiners treated Bitcoin like other assets but instead we have a cult like obsession with HODLing and posts like yours implying that we're sure to have another ATH.
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:42:50
I mean sure he should be criticized but a lot of people here seem to want to write him off for a couple wrong predictions. Also every analyst gets "big one's" wrong, you're predicting the future it's not like anyone can be right all the time. A lot of analysts thought trump would really hurt the economy, it's not an unreasonable thing to think but it's very easy to criticize people after the fact. Show me someone who's made as many predictions as Paul and has had a better track record, all this criticism seems like stuff you could level against anyone who makes a significant number of predictions.

Unless it is. It's not that unlikely we'll never see another ATH

Sorry you feel this way. I do ignore a lot of what you say but that's on purpose. I've had long arguments like this before and if you respond to everything the person says then the conversation will slowly increase in size until it's just ridiculous. I don't want to spend too much time responding to you so I don't respond to everything you say, I'm sorry if that doesn't meet your expectation. I was wrong about thinking it'd take a month to send a transaction and I didn't want to ignore that to make you think I was ducking the questions I couldn't respond to so I owned up to it.

Why does any of this stuff matter at all? Sure I could go on about how there's a bunch more assets than stocks like gold where you can own it and it can't be rehypotecated, but this ultimately doesn't matter. Why does Bitcoins ownership and trustless nature actually make the nature of the markets so different that you can't analyze it using tradition investment techniques and can't use traditional investment strategies? This all seems like irrelevant implementation details, Bitcoin still behaves like other assets and can be treated like other assets.

I don't know why you guys act like the collapse of the financial system would be a good thing.

You're pretending like it's 2008. Bitcoin is a household name and has a market cap of over 100 billion, a lot of actual investors have been buying bitcoin not just nerds. It makes zero sense to call it a "new asset rising from zero" when each coin is worth over 6k and used to be worth 20k. Also your whole premise is wrong, there's plenty of new assets rising from zero they're called penny stocks. 


Lol this is like saying blackberry has a ton of opportunity for growth, look at how big the smartphone market is blackberry can sell so many more smartphones. Just because there's no risk of saturating a market doesn't mean you're going to experience growth, Bitcoin could have already peaked.

If you want your prediction to be accurate at all you do. It's very very hard to make accurate predictions about things that are untested, and given something as complicated and untested as LN you're prediction that it'll be able to scale to billions is complete worthless. This is a massive problem with your overall thinking, you're making such massive extrapolations to reach the conclusion you want.


No I'm not, at all. If Bitcoin can only do 52 million transactions per month and more than 52 million people try and open channels in a month it won't work no matter when they try and open them.


How is that reasonable? People get paid bi-weekly or even weekly sometimes, you should be able to open a new channel at the very least weekly. Also if opening channels is really this rare, this system is going to be centralized as hell. Like if you want a decentralized system people will need to open multiple channels. Why would anyone want to switch to this system where you have to carefully plan when you're going to open channels because if you don't you might have to wait a month to open another one or pay stupid fees? I just don't think this system would actually function, the amount of liquidity the nodes would need would be insane.


Why would I want to have to convert my bitcoin to USD every time I want to pay taxes when I could just use USD.
Edit: Overall you're being far far too generous to Bitcoin, like you're assuming there won't be a bunch of other problems with LN scaling to 1 billion people and you're assuming people will be fine with only doing on chain transactions every 2 months and you're assuming bitcoin will be able to do 300 tps. All this is assuming a billion people will want to use Bitcoin and I really don't see why they would. USD already works, inflation is a pretty small problem compared to what we would likely face switching to any completely new system.

I don't intend to speak for you, I'm speaking for normal people, average Joe's. And for average Joe's there's no reason to use Bitcoin. And without average Joe's crypto nerds like you can fight your whole life to promote Bitcoin, it won't kill the banks. 
Also why do you care so much if Bitcoin succeeds? I don't really believe you hate banks that much. You seem too emotionally attached to Bitcoin and that seems to be driving some of your ideas of it destroying banks

My entry into Bitcoin was kinda interesting because I was somewhat in it for the technology and usability. Like I thought it'd be interesting to play with and it'd be good to send small donations to people so I bought a small amount of it. Then I realized the technology sucks, I bought in at the point where it was like $5+ to send a single transaction so I had to hold it because it was too expensive to send, and I made some money that way. I feel like anyone in it for the technology is paying attention to alt-coins because Bitcoin isn't the most impressive technology wise.

I keep underestimating how slow people on this sub are. Like did you think I was just asking for differences in Bitcoin and other assets for fun? Did you really think I meant there was literally no difference between Bitcoin and other assets, that it's literally the same as trading a stock? I mean it was really really obvious that when I said Bitcoin really isn't that different from other so you should use traditional investment techniques I mean that it's another asset so it can be evaluated as one. But somehow you concluded that I meant there was no differences between Bitcoin and other assets.
Edit: I just noticed I literally specified


I don't know I missed that, if they would have fully quoted me it would be clear they're full of shit

How are bitcoiners this economically illiterate? It makes zero sense to compare stock prices between stocks and especially between crypto. You should compare market caps.
