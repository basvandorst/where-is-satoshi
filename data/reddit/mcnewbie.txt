The funds were taken *out of* my wallet on blockchain.info. I can log in to the wallet, but all the bitcoins were transferred out of it in June.

I wish I'd had the instructions simplified that well for me a few years and $1500 ago.

maybe walmart could offer its employees a small bonus for accepting their wages in bitcoin, partially or in full. like you get paid 5% extra for accepting payment in bitcoin, or something.
and then you can turn right around and buy all your stuff at walmart in the bitcoins you just got paid in.

implying bitcoins aren't money?

it'd be nice if people could do some research on psychedelics, their mechanisms of action, and their effects on the mind, instead of having every effort to do studies on them blocked by various government agencies.

this might be a good thing, or it might not. on one hand, it's good that people are finally starting to see that bitcoins are worth real, actual money, and on the other hand, if there's TOO much bitcoin spent on these sites as soon as they open, it might be seen as dumping a useless asset in favor of one that's actually worth something.
anyway, here's hoping it continues its climb... to the moon!

it's not the first complaint i've heard about blockchain's customer service.

Not a question. Just a lamentation.
