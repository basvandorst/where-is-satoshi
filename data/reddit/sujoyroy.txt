Ah yes, I believe that image was made by the CEO of Bitcoin, who has been authorised by the Bitcoin government to decide things like this.

I'm fairly sure they gave themselves over 3000% proof of stake interest because they split the 350% to just under 1% daily compounded staking. You can view this live on the blockchain here:
This address appears to be generating new coins through staking every 6 hours. Impossible to be sure this early, but it looks like the entire address is staking including newly minted coin. That results in hyper-inflation for the coin supply @ &gt;3000% per year.
I'd love it if someone could analyse the code to confirm or deny this, as I'm just an amateur programmer.

To be confirmed, but it looks like hard-coded Prime nodes earn ~1% daily, which equates to over 3,000% earnings per year (and not 350% as thought). Subtle coding.

It's pretty much impossible for this coin to ever succeed when the developers added the ability for themselves to earn over 3000% staking rate on their wallets and premined 97% of the coin.
They've been testing their 3000% staking and everyone can view it on the blockchain: 
Newly minted coins begin staking immediately at 0.96% per day, resulting in an outrageous annual return of all that compounded interest. I've plotted a graph of the stake amount over time to illustrate this:

This comment has some background on GAW before crypto:

Key points: 97% premine and 350% interest rate onto their own hard-coded nodes.

Maybe I'm an anomaly, but practically all of the places I use bitcoin require some kind of third party processor. I need to find that bitcoin burger place in London!

I can see that the title of the article is a little sensationalist, but the content is quite fair:


Until we start using mechanisms like smart contracts, we can be left hoping that the exchange doesn't lose our coin. Isn't this a genuine fear of newcomers to Bitcoin?

I think it's a fact of life that even with a completely decentralised currency, it's incredibly hard to avoid 3rd party trust issues.

If I wanted to convert the bitcoin you paid me to fiat I'd probably use bitstamp and have to trust that they pay out the GBP to my bank account. If I wanted to subscribe to a Twitch stream, I'd pay using bitcoin through Xsolla processing and that would require some trust in Xsolla to complete the transaction.
Yes I understand that if Xsolla and Bitpay started losing transactions it would reflect very badly on their business and they would want to avoid that at all costs, so customer-side trust in payment processors tends to only have a small risk. Something like MtGox shows what happens when bigger customer risk is at stake.
Not entirely sure why my comment above was downvoted but I'm willing to listen and learn.

It must have taken you longer to set that all up than it would to git clone peercoin and change the staking rate to 3270%.
I like how you muddled up all the homophones. Very authentic.
