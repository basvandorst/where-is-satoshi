I was able to withdraw to my segwit wallet on my ledger nano s from coinbase (for bitcoin at least, had to use legacy for litecoin), what did I miss?

the 7.5 triplion is only the physical coins and banknotes that's not a fair comparison, narrow money is 36.8 trillion and broad money is 90.4 trillion.
it is also important that fiat currencies are continuesly increasing (not only but via inflation) so when speculating future crypto marketcap in fiat currencies that is a factor.
plus some of the bitcoins are lost forever, which means that counting the marketcap via the total amount of bitcoins is a bit bogus (

I think bitcoin is different and I trust it on the long run but in general it can be dangerous to always buy when the price continues to drop
another thing: we always preach that one shouldn't invest more than he/she is fine with losing, so some people simply can't continue to buy the dip because they reached that point

just buy the dip
