With the FED raising interest rates on Wed, US time, commodities are going to get decimated and so will the AUD. Possibly as low as the 30 US cent area at the bottom of the cruel grind down, srs. Get more BTC now.

Excellent. Much better than raising the block limit and jeopardizing bitcoin's greatest protection and crucial component - decentralization.

The best current store of value favoured by governments, central banks and royalty is Gold. Gold is the best store of value BECAUSE it is NOT spent at the retail level. Having an ultra low velocity (the rate at which it changes hands) makes it store value very well. This is why it is dumb to try and turn Bitcoin into a transacting currency. Leave it as a store of value, and leave fiat as the transacting currency. Or alternatively an altcoin/add on.

Bitcoin needs to be better marketed to the masses first. Make it easy to understand and purchase. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 00:26:11
The absolute worst case scenario would be reduced adoption of bitcoin to those that follow rules like sheep. It could be forced underground out of the mainstream. Kind of like how torrents are essentially banned but still exist and are used. Or drugs.
Wouldn't stop the fact that bitcoin is one of a kind. There is nothing else available that is decentralized - there are always going to be people that need a way to move wealth between borders or outside of the banking system. There is a real need for bitcoin that cannot be replaced.
This would translate to lower prices than what could theoretically could be reached. And/or very slow growth.

DON'T GIVE THE BANKERS AND IMF A WEAKNESS TO EXPLOIT FFS PEOPLE, BTC NEEDS TO BE AS SECURE AS FUCKING POSSIBLE, NO EXCEPTIONS!!
@_date: 2015-12-27 03:26:33
Here's an idea for you all. Buy a bunch of Bitcoin stickers and start sticking them all over your city - the more we market BTC the more adoption we will get. The more people are reminded or made aware of BTC the better.
Stick them on bus stops, on street lamps, around colleges, in malls, on the street, even toilets. Make people see it everywhere they go.

On a serious note, that fucking sucks dude! Hope they can figure something out on their system to give you access back.

For this to work there needs to be an outright ban in every single country in the world. And even then it wouldn't work because it can't be shutdown and people will continue to use it. However, it could slow the pace of growth in BTC significantly for a while. If they ban it it would be an admission that btc works and that they fear it, so then we know what their achilles heel is and that the people have a weapon to fight the banks.

Not if the demand side for commodities was artifically propped up by debt. With rising borrowing costs across the globe via higher fed interest rates, the cost to service extraction of commodities at higher prices via interest payments/servicing will be too high. Also nobody will be lending to build the multi billion$ infrastructure construction. Age of debt is over,now we deleverage.
@_date: 2015-12-27 09:07:12
Pretty much! If we cover enough large cities with stickers we're sure to have some kind of positive impact for BTC awareness whether it goes streisand or not.

You will get it back lol. Problem with people (including myself) is that we think on such short term basis. If you look at any long term charts of stocks, commodities etc - this stuff takes years. Everything does.
Hell. Even the wall street crash of 1929 leading to the great depression took 3 years to hit bottom. Looks like a really sharp drop, but it was still 3 years.

Dear core devs. Don't give into the noise and ignorance of the bigger block crowd, please. You're doing a good job so far, and it's amazing that we're gonna win this fight! Bitcoin as decentralized savings/SoV outside of the banking system!! Three cheers
@_date: 2016-01-20 11:53:35
The majority of people simply do not understand how a SoV is best seperated from its MoE function. You do not take gold into a shop to buy groceries but it stores wealth a hell of a lot better than dollars.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:07:26
Funny how I got told to shove it when I SAID the price was gonna go down a few months ago and not up. Now is NOT a good time to buy, simply because of the macro global economic situation. BTC is NOT the place people will be thinking of right now as the world panics about oil and other commodity prices crashing. The environment atm is DEFLATIONARY, ie you don't want BTC right now.
@_date: 2016-01-20 11:57:08
Maybe, but the internet with VR is becoming more and more intertwined with reality. Bitcoin could be pushed to underground internet money, but it still will never die.
@_date: 2016-01-09 10:09:46
No changes to bitcoin should be made unless decentralization is still a central pillar of its function. This is so incredibly important. You have a lack of knowledge in global geopolitics or else you would realise this first and foremost. Any weaknesses will be taken advantage of. The free market will choose bitcoin with a low velocity anyway because of its superior SoV function - this means more wealth will accumulate in a low velocity coin over time as more wealth searches for a safe 'home' in an increasingly dangerous global economy. As BTC grows, why would hedge funds, governments and the ultra wealthy dump money in a riskier SoV that can be taken down more easily. Current BTC is SAFE and doesn't need to become the replacement for visa/fiat to be successful. This is because we already have visa/fiat for spending. Save your wealth in SAFE decentralized BTC and only withdraw savings from it if you must spend it. Not for coffees, clothes and other junk. Think of GOLD.
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:27:27
Yes - "fails" 
@_date: 2015-01-24 11:58:16
It's a store of value, not a transactional currency. ETF gold is traded, but real gold bullion shouldn't move much. It lies still. It'll still be there 200 years later when you're dead, as well as most of today's (if not all) currencies. It lasts from civilization to civilization. 
@_date: 2016-01-20 22:42:26
So what's the plan if bitcoin is targeted hard by regulatory authorities? Do we hide the mining equipment? Can bitcoin survive periods where mining is forcibly shutdown?

@_date: 2016-01-15 02:24:21
Rising fees are GOOD. They encourage savings by making it more expensive to blow on stupid shit like coffees and tshirts. It reduces the velocity of the Bitcoin "currency" slowing the pace at which bitcoins change hands, making it a superior SoV. Think like gold vs silver. A nice "heavy" bitcoin makes it the crem de la creme of cryptocurrency SoVs. Use fiat, sidechains, altcoins or whatever for your purchases and BTC for savings that you hardly touch.

@_date: 2016-01-15 08:16:18
Gold is the best SoV in the world and also the most manipulated assett class. It's heavy and expensive to guard, and you literally have to physically move it from owner to owner, which internationally involves jumbo jets and ocean capable ships, including armoured guarded cars to move it between the vaults and shipyards/airports. It stores wealth just fine and is the assett choice of royalty, banking magnates, smart governments and the uhnwi populations.
Also, you don't take bullion to the cafe to buy a coffee. Or your groceries or anything small. Again, best SoV.
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:14:42

Yes. I only have access to a cell atm.
Any vulnerability that can be taken advantage of, will. Look what happened to saddam hussein when he tried to depeg his currency from the US petrodollar and start trading gold for oil. Anything that threatens the fiat dominance will be destroyed. 
Also, by increasing the the velocity of money with bitcoin by increasing the amount of times it changes hands lowers its utility as the best SoV. The better a SoV, the more wealth will come with time due to gresham's law.
@_date: 2016-01-09 07:23:14
Raising the block limit = raises vulnerability to attacks by banks/IMF/governments. Bye bye to BTC if this happens.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:17:32
Thank F**KING CHRIST! Bitcoin is saved! To the mods. Thankyou for what you have done. You have realised that ANY WEAKNESSES, especially ones brought on by raising the block limit (without ensuring safety first) in the current environment is DANGEROUS for the survival of bitcoin in a world dominated by central agencies that issue fiat currency for their own purposes in pursuit of power, that DO NOT wish there to be any competitors. They will destroy competition if they have the capcity, just like they did in IRAQ and LIBYA:
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:52:41
Bitcoin needs to grow, but by other means that does not involve turning it into a currency at the detriment of its safety against attacks by banks/governments.
As the global economy continues to deteriorate and the availability of good alternative SoVs begins to deteriorate, more money will seek a new safe place and over time more of that money will find itself in bitcoin.
Also, there are more and more strong hands creating a higher price floor with time. Volatility will only be able to send the BTC price down to higher and higher lows.
@_date: 2016-01-09 07:56:27
This exactly. Decentralization must be maintained. Full stop.

@_date: 2016-01-16 08:40:02
Nice read. But people still want an SoV outside of the banking system as they continue to wake up through the internet. Bitcoin is not meant to be used as a currency medium of exchange (MoE), but rather as an SoV akin to gold. You don't need quick transactions for bitcoin to be a fantastic SoV just like you don't need speed boats, bullet trains or supersonic jets to transport gold. Bitcoins (like gold) will learn to lie "still". Hardly ever spent and rather hoarded, just like the gold stashes of royalty that collect dust in their untouchable vaults, being untouched for decades or more. Yet still the best SoV, you want it to have that low velocity, the rate at which it changes hands. The banks can have their fast MoE network for commerce and bitcoin can be our safe decentralized SoV. 
Transporting gold between vaults is also very expensive and requires a high fee. Again, still best SoV in the world. Btc as you can see will follow this same path.
@_date: 2016-01-24 00:14:41
**This:** *requirement that Bitcoin remain decentralized. That requirement is more important than low fees because without decentralization, Bitcoin is no real different than legacy currency systems and thus has no real value.*
@_date: 2016-01-14 23:13:35
All his reasons for the failure of bitcoin are based on the idea of using it as a currency. He's a tech geek with a poor understanding of economics. Carry on - here's to decentralized Bitcoin being used as an ultra safe SoV like gold. I'm glad he's gone.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:49:13
Let core win, it's objectively the best path for bitcoin. In the mean time keep coin prices low so I can accumulate.

Funny you say that because gold bullion is considered the best store of value in the world, and that is because it has such a very low velocity, barely ever changing hands at all. In fact, some stays hidden in the vaults of elites longer than anybody on earth has lived for today.
