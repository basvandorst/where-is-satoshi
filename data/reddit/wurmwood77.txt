I already downloaded BitCoin Qt instead of BlockChain.  They're similar, right?  I don't want to sell the coins; I want to use them for purchases.

Okay, that last part clears things up for me, but before I read that, I sent my coins from BlockChain to MtGox.  You're saying I need to send them BACK?  Can I even do that or do I now have to use the money in my MtGox account to buy or sell bitcoins because that's what the site is for?
Thanks for clearing that up for me.

I have bitcoins I want to use to purchase things.  That doesn't count as selling them, does it?  Why do so many people recommend keeping your bitcoins with MtGox if all you can do is buy and sell bitcoins there?  Can you even use funds from a MtGox account to buy anything besides bitcoins?

Question about BitCoin Qt: Do I need to wait for it to sync to deposit funds into it?  That seems to be taking F-O-R-E-V-E-R.

So they need to verify my account before I can get those coins back?  How long does that take?  I've read that it takes 10 days and I've read that it takes 6 months.  I've sent them the proper ID and proof of residence.
Btw, does BlockChain only make TEMPORARY ewallets or are those permanent?  Seems like I read that they're just temporary, but now I can't find anything to confirm that.
Thanks again.

I DID do some reading.  I didn't find the answers I needed.  That's why I'm here.

Alright.  I think what I was thinking of is the fact that you can generate a new address for your coins or something.
I think that's all the questions I have, for now.  Thanks again.

Alright, I already made the mistake of sending my bitcoins from BlockChain to MtGox, since I didn't realize that the former is an ewallet and the latter is an exchange site and the two are not the same.  I thought ewallets were a feature of the exchange sites.  How do I get them back?

Okay, maybe you guys can save me a headache, here.  I want my bitcoins to be anonymous and it was recommended to me that I run them through an ewallet or two to fortify their anonymity.  I thought bitcoins were anonymous and untraceable anyway.  Is all this really necessary?

I bought bitcoins through BitInstant.  It's my understanding that I need to deposit them into an ewallet like MtGox, but apparently to do THAT, I have to run them through something like BitCoin Qt or BlockChain.  This is alot more complicated than I anticipated.

Okay, I was apparently looking on the wrong FAQ, but now that I've found the right one, I'm not much better off.  It says "Using the bitcoin application of your choice, please transfer funds to from your wallet to the copied bitcoin address."  Bitcoin application?  What's that and how do I use it to make the transfer?

I've downloaded BitCoint Qt, but now I don't know how to add funds to THAT.
