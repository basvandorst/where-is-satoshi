Not sure why the Gems articles get down voted so hard.  The intergrated bitcoin wallet is awesome.  My wife downloaded Gems, set up her own account and I was able to send her bitcoins and required no hand holding.  
These are the type of apps we need to onboard people to Bitcoin.  Everyone has their "Ahhh haaa" moment when they receive their first bitcoin.

I just don't think the risk/reward is there for me.  I have to ask myself.  Is losing 1 bitcoin worth gaining .03 bitcoin on a long term (bitcoin world long term lol) investment with a young chinese exchange? 
I'm not saying they are particularly a bad company or have bad intentions.  Gox didn't have a problem until you couldn't withdrawal your coins one day and that's normally how I've seen it go.  One day ever thing is good, then boom, withdrawals stop.  
I'm just saying be wise and everyone should use their head weigh the risks involved before sending their coins off to be held in china.  If your comfortable with it, I wish you luck and you have a higher risk/reward tolerance for your bitcoin than I do.  Good luck.

A bit over dramatic but after looking at your post history, your negative attitude/outlook in every sub explains it.

Looks great.  This could really be one of the killer bitcoin apps.   I can't wait for beta invites to go out.  
@_date: 2014-12-31 16:29:05
It's really well done.  There is room for some things to be improved for ease of use but for a first release I'm really impressed.   
I loaded a little btc on the app and sent it to a friend with no problem.  Just had to type "0.0001 btc".  
Social networking and bitcoin were made for eachother.  I belive it will be a clean simple app to pair the two that is going to take bitcoin mainstream and this has really good potential.

I only saw the account tipping people decent sized tips and with somewhat thoughtful comments.  Why is that considered selfpromotion?  Did they go full shrill on a post or something?
Or is this the result of people being mad someone tipped them $5? I find those angry posts so humorous. 
"How dare you internet stranger!! You just come here read my comments and give me $5! What a jerk!"
I imagen them at a bar freaking out at the manager " A stranger just walked by my bar stool, sets $5 down next to me and said the next round was on them on their way out the door.  I demand you ban that generous jerk! SECURITY!! STRANGER DANGER!!!"

Its shame to see such great ideas being wasted with bad naming and marketing.  They will never reach the full potential adaption of their idea with nefarious sounding names.  Even if the products is great, there is a predisposition in the general public to associate darkmarket, dark coin, midnight market, blackcoin to underground illegal market/coin and by using it one is associated with those negative predispositions.  I hope it is open source so it can be forked with a better name like open bazaar did.  Either way good luck, great ideas.

I don't really feel comfortable letting a Chinese exchange hole my bitcoin for 3 months.  After getting burnt with bitfloor.  I never leave money in exchanges and this has helped me dodge a lot of exchange seizure/failures/losses/hacks/vanishing ceo.   
Guess I'm just saying for a 3% return, 3 months is a looooong time in bitcoin world to let a chinese exchange hold you coin.
Be careful and good luck.

Satashi said to think of lost coin as a gift to everyone.  Or something like that.  It adds some value because it reduces the supply of available bitcoin.  If it impacts the exchange rate is a whole other speculation argument all together.

This is a really cool project, if successful,  it will really start showing the true benefits of bitcoin and the blockchain.

The way he created bitcoin was well thought out and done very selflessly with the ultimate goal of ending state issued/controled money.  I like to think he will continue that mind set and do something awesome with the coins when the price goes to the moon. 
What if he distributed them to the poorest people on the planet? At $100,000 or even $10,000 a coin that could have a massive effect on millions of people and really start the wealth redistribution across the globe.
Keeping a small amount and using the majority to increase adaption and change lives would net him far more than just selling them.  
Anyways, I just feel as if there is more to his plan if he does still control them.  
Cashing them in for a currency he is trying to eliminate, seems counter productive to his entire goal.    
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:36:09

The Android version of the Gems app is out and is quite well done for a beta release.  The built in wallet works, I've loaded some btc and sent to a friend just by texting "0.001 btc" .  
I'll be honest, like another ahhh moment, it felt so natural to text bitcoin like that.  The same ahhh moment when you send/receive bitcoin from a wallet.  
It's easy to set up and has a built in bitcoin wallet making it SUPER easy to send and receive btc in a native text message environment without opening a seperate app.  I really think it could do well. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:40:11
It doesn't have to be one way or the other.  Bitcoin provides the option to choose when you need anonymity.   
When you need to do something you don't want linked to a public address just make a new address and don't use your publicly linked address.  
There will always be services that require your information for access to their system whether it be because of legal or operational.
@_date: 2015-01-16 02:25:17

@_date: 2015-01-02 13:55:20
Why? Why? Why did you leave your money in a web wallet that has been having problems?
I'm sorry you lost your coins and I don't want to kick you while your down but come on, problems with their service has been posted all over the place for weeks.  
This is the scary part of Bitcoin and being your own bank.  People are lazy and ignore all warnings thinking it will never happen to them. 
Its an expensive life lesson, Good thing about this is, you'll do a much better job in the future protecting your assets.  Could have been worse and happend after you accumulated 20 btc.  Now you can start your collection again and store them more secure.  Good Luck.
Have a coffee @_date: 2015-01-16 03:30:34
Great.  What is the total distribution of sendcoin.  I saw the crowd sale was 21 mln. Is that the total supply or just the crowd sale.  
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:26:27
I really feel that the advocates of side chains only like them because it gives them an opportunity add a layer of fees to bitcoin that they can't do using the blockchain directly.  
The blockchain can be better and will get better but opening the door to a bunch of fee changing side change as an answer to spam is not beneficial to the ecosystem and long term growth of bitcoin.

First, thanks for deciding to try accepting bitcoin. 
I would suggest incorporating it in to your second step, under the payment option, it is, just another payment option.
By requiring personal information, it really loses a lot of the benefits of paying with bitcoin. Its an understandable requirements for fiat but completely unnecessary for bitcoin.  
A visitor should be able to toss change in your bucket like walking out of a store and giving to the bell ringers. 
Thanks again for all your efforts!!  
Phone post ftw.
Edit: removed incorrect minimum requirement on bitcoin.  They have no minimum bitcoin donation ;).

Thought I linked in the orginal post.
@_date: 2015-04-16 23:14:23
I understand why it's that way by default.  I was suggesting it as an option. 
Like a check box and when clicked give a pop notification of the possible pit falls if sending from an exchange or some sort of web wallet service.  Cuts out a step and makes the process more stream line for users who opt for it.
It would increase my use of the app.  
@_date: 2015-04-16 22:44:44
I've used it quite a few time both before and after the name change.  
I liked the convenience of the auto refund to the btc address that it was paid with in the orginal app.  Is it possible to bring that option back?
I know you were working on a feature to be able to put a btc address in and refund, but last time I tried it didn't work, so i just left the 4 cents left over.  Coinbase tracking weirds me out so I really try not to use them for receiving.
Great work so far. Keep at it and people will come.  This thread is a great approach to your target market and engaging your clients.  
Edit: Guess it's been a while. Just checked out the site and see you added the btc refund field.  We'll done!
Would it be possible for an auto refund to the address paid from option, to save the step?
@_date: 2015-09-24 16:20:30
Wouldn't the immedded mining create an immutable unique device ID in turn creating a device time line on the blockchain? 
@_date: 2015-09-24 19:01:03
Right, mining its self doesnt create an ID but a unique ID can be created by using the immedded private key in combination with with the local hardware id's to create a unique device ID.  It could then register it's self to the blockchain with the mined bits and start it's time line.  
Maybe useful for drones and auntomous robots.

Thanks for the coffee bud.  I'll use it in the A.M. :)

I understand.  I apologize if I was unclear.  It will not let me advance and is giving no error when clicking the "sign up".  
Edit: reason I assumed there needed to be something checked for the terms is the phrase "by creating an account you agree to our terms to service" pops up after hitting sign up, as if it was an error and hadn't been agreed to.  Selecting "sign up" again does nothing.  
Hope it helps.  Kind of a big bug. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 14:06:59
I gave the coffee app a try again after the load buttons were back up.  Loading worked as did paying for my coffee but when I requested to have the balance returned it is stuck.
  "We're processing your payment. The coffee will be ready soon!"
I sent an email to your support about it as well.  Let me know if you have any questions tracking down the bug.  The card never showed the updated balance after paying for the coffee, it was stuck at $10 but the clerk told me the balance remaining was $4.42.

The new coffee.foldapp.com doesn't work for me.  There is no deposit button.  Even after signing up and creating an account.  Coinforcoffee worked so much better before they just went dark.  Maybe they were bough by a less skilled company or something.

ToS page only comes up when I press the notification phrase. The ToS page doesn't have any where to agree but does have a large blank area at the bottom where maybe it's supposed to be.  I can exit the ToS page via the "x" at the top of the ToS page.  Opening the ToS page seems to reset the error/notification phrase but comes back upon pressing the "sign up" button again and then the "sign up" is non responsive again.

Companies that sell bitcoin are not immune to the time it takes to set up and establish a relationship with a financial institution.  If part of that relationship requires a selfie, taking it in a dark room with no flash isn't going to expidite the on boarding process.

Some People fear what they don't understand and their first reaction is to defend what they do understand.
Others already have a very good position in fiat, so the suggestion that there is a rising superior alternative devaluing their current position in fiat puts them on the defensive.
My favorite comment from many interviews and blogs is "you can't own something in cyberspace, it doesn't really exist".  My thoughts when I see that is "I bet they have a website they will quickly claim ownership of. "
