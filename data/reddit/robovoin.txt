Don't share your privatekeys on r/btc

in pool u'll have exxxtra small share per hashrate, maybe 10-100 satoshis per month.
But if you mine solo and suddenly solve the whole block (chance is ~1 to 10^18)

Bitstamp order book:
Sell wall 150BTC till

The chart looks crazy. Just one guy putting money from one pocket to another

...And Saint Hodler raised his Bitcorn up on high, saying, "O LORD, bless this Thy Holy Bitcorn that with it Thou mayest blow Thine government and banks to tiny bits, in Thy mercy." And the LORD did grin and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats and large chu...... And the LORD spake, saying, "First shalt thou put the Bitcorn to Holy Full Node, then shalt thou count to one million, no more, no less. One million shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be one million. One hundred thousand K shalt thou not count, neither count thou two hundred K, excepting that thou then proceed to one million. Five millions is right out. Once the number one million, being the one millionth number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Bitcorn towards thy exchange, who being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it."[
