What about the fact that they have over $20 trillion listed on their stock exchange with hundreds of billions of dollars in daily volume? This will surely open up a lot of new money for the crypto market. Whoever trades on the NYSE will see they now offer cryptocurrency which imo would legitimize and be more appealing to traditional investors.

How can you filter coins by performance over 5 years? I can only manage to filter by change over the last 7 days on coinmarketcap

Aren’t they just raiding awareness so people dont buy cash over actual btc?

You are obviously misinformed and/or uneducated about cryptocurrencies and your own financial system. You should look into how fractional reserve banking and the federal reserve works, then compare it to BTC

You don’t believe in btc?

It’s held a 30-50% gain for almost a month now, don’t be so worried about the daily movements (unless you’re a trader ofc). Looking like the beginning of a nice bull run (:

“Believe” in the sense of do you understand the greatness and potential that bitcoin has to offer for solving a lot of the issues associated with traditional fiat currencies?

I heard that all of his coins are dispersed in thousands of 50 btc wallets. If that’s the case liquidating them over time would be hard to detect, which is what he’d probably do. Why would he make the market drop to $0 rendering the rest of his btc worthless?
