Because from a financial stand point, you're too dangerous and risky to bother doing business with. Doing business with somebody that has the power to destabilise their entire organisation is a two sided sword, one not worth wielding.
They are probably now wondering if you know of any other exploits but chose not to reveal them. Not worth the risk in their eyes.

Can anybody explain how or why this would happen?

Surely you guys know this bubble will pop eventually right?
This us just a dotcom bubble for the teenies. Sure bitcoin might go higher, but it might go lower too... a lot lower.

Because retail traders are idiots. Only 5% make money.
People follow the leader, they are to lazy to make their own decisions and too scared of being wrong... which ironically ends up with them being wrong.

I can explain why if anybody wants to know.

Okay, so the first thing to know is this: 
Currencies, Commodities, Stocks, etc. - all these markets are driven by two things. Fear and greed.
You have to realise that while the big institutions do have massive amounts of capital in the markets, they are hugely outnumbered by retail traders like you and me. The thing is, a majority of people in our position aren't wholly committed to the markets and simply see it as a get rich quick scheme. For this reason, they succumb to fear and greed - just like everybody else. When huge numbers of people give the same reaction you get massive price spikes for no logical reason. Don't believe me? [Check out one of the first instance when speculation got out of hand.](
Now, with the price of bitcoin going up everybodies thinking the same thing "Shit man, I gotta jump on this before it's too late!" Now, that there is greed talking. Not only this, but you have something called [a confirmation bias]( - which in trading or investing, is super super dangerous! So when it's going up, you're looking for reasons to get in on it, instead of weighing the pros and cons to see if it's really a wise move.
When most uneducated traders see a post like this, instead of doing their own research they think "Oh gee, this guy knows what he's doing! I'm going to jump onboard." Now, if this were a penny stock it would be safe to assume this is a pump and dump (some people describe my last relationship with those very words). Where you hype up a security so it goes up in price, then you sell your worthless shares. [By the way, this is illegal.](
[That doesn't stop celebrities from doing it though.](
Now considering, that this guy has every month for a long time repeated 'to the moon' for a currency that has gone up and down in that time. This makes his advice incredibly pointless. So my advice? Just ignore him. He is too ambiguous to be of any use. For all we know he's an astrological trader forecasting his highs on moon phases. (People actually do this by the way.)

All currencies work like this.

Tell that to the guy who discovered gold.
