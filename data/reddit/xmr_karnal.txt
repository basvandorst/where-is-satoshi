If you're a beginner, by all means learn more about trading, but if you want to make money, play the long game.
Pick some cryptocurrencies after doing a good amount of research (and not because someone on reddit said it's the next big thing™), start putting some money into it every month, make sure your stash is secure (hint: hardware wallet, like the ledger nano s), and don't check the market every day.

That's fine. Keep buying, keep hodling.
Why do you care what other people think?

Arguably it's quite messed up if you have to pay $50 to move $25.
I know I avoided a few payments I had to do because of this.

So no savings or emergency funds?
I'm not so sure buddy.

This is not true, and I speak from experience.
What it will make you do is *really* consider if you need to buy whatever it is that you need to buy, because you assume that later on, you could get more for the same, so to speak.
However at some point you also realize that the time &amp; opportunity to use the money is limited, and nobody knows what tomorrow brings.
So as far as I can see, it would just make people spend less recklessly, and allow more people to have more savings, which translates to more peace of mind and options in life, and yes, even productivity - because now you're afforded the luxury of really pondering where to pour your creativity, which almost invariably will, in the end, end up benefiting the economy as a whole.
tldr: freedom &amp; options

That somehow just keeps happening by the billions.
Perhaps we need even more invasive surveillance to fix it.
(don't give them any ideas)

Because they want the product *now*, after a long time of deliberately wondering if they *really* need the product, and then make a decision to buy *now* rather than *next year* because they *understand* that the use for this money is limited (everyone dies in the end).

They are not supposed to inflate at high levels either from machinations by central banks designed to force you to spend your savings since interest rates are set very low.
If you'd rather not save, or save in a currency that steadily and predictably depreciates, well, I guess to each its own.

Actually I just replied to someone else about this today.
Here's my take on the matter:

Quite the contrary, at least about the investment (speculation) part.


The naive investor will reason that since it has dropped 80%+, it is a bad time to get in.
The successful investor recognizes that, provided fundamentals have not changed, there is a huge opportunity to buy at deeply discounted prices.
One does not make fortunes investing after an asset has risen 80%.

It's the "doing nothing" part that is problematic.
If you hold Bitcoin/Monero/etc today, you are still engaging in a high-risk bet and putting your capital at high risk, being an early adopter of a technology that may or may not amount to much of anything.
Personally I still think that it's revolutionary technology (especially the fungible sort of crypto) which is why my capital is still at risk.
Depending on your personal situation, you may or may not be active in the community, driving discussion forward, raising awareness, writing code, making sites, designing protocols, etc.
Either way - this hypothetical person is probably not "doing nothing".
And maybe they could be, maybe they got lucky. It happens - I'm sure there are also many who just bought some, forgot about it, and by sheer luck found themselves with a much fatter fiat-denominated wallet later on.
That being the case, the question becomes - what are *they* going to do with those resources now?

[Nonsense]( and disingenuous.
Patreon and Paypal enjoy near monopoly status in that arena, and under them Visa and MasterCard.
[It is not surprising then]( than MasterCard is now dictating who can and cannot use their service.
If you don't see the problem with this, then with all respect I can muster, you're an idiot, and it might only become obvious to you why this is a problem when, due to some long-forgotten comment you left online and which was politically acceptable back when, your debit and credit cards stop working because your then-in-vogue opinion is now considered hate speech, and you have no business to spend money in polite society.

Monero?
