Like I have a hidden agenda? What are you able to see in my transparent ad? Please explain yourself.

I could supply those however I am a little reticent to do that for security reasons. Make no mistake I am not a competitor just a BTC investor late to the party. Just bought my first 20 some coins this year,

Well this might have made them move on my withdrawl as I just received an email where I had to OK my withdrawl. 
I'll report in if it goes either way.
Paper wallets seem the safest place for bitcoins.

I went to my coinbase acct and checked on the progress of my withdrawl and the email OK was green checked and a time for bank transfer was hours and minutes listed.
 So it seems the entire debacle was due to them not sending me the email to OK my withdrawl. Took them 15 days to do what my security settings was set up to do.
 This whole thing started when they emailed me that I was assigned a "case number" because I was a "high volume customer" which is ridiculous as their limits only allowed me to but $2K at a time. It came from my american bank and the money had been there for ages. I was insulted they described it as a "case" and withdrew from my hot wallet. That went off without a hitch which I transferred to Bitfinex.
NEVER will I do business with them again or their sister company GDAX.

Update: Seems the problem the whole time was Coinbase was not sending a validation request to my email as instructed by my security settings which stalled the withdrawal. I sent 14 emails and got case  assigned to all and 4 replies. Finally Eric suggested I withdraw the request and start over. That did the trick and to wrap it up only took  19 days to go from Coinbase to my bank.
Glad it was money I did not need to eat on or pay bills.

NEVER use Coinbase! I have been waiting since July 10th, 2016 for a withdrawl of 10 BTC today is July 21, 2016. I have been emailing them everyday and today I got a form letter reply asking if my problem has been addressed.
What possible reason do they have for not following thru with my withdrawl request? The current answer seems to be to rip me off.
