A Sheep that likes bitcoin. Duh..
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:24:39
You are the one person here that speaks sense. USA Lawsuit towards a company in JAPAN. 
The market is what it always has been a way to trade one currency for anoher. Even if Mt. Gox has large stake in that doesn't mean it is the only thing keeping bitcoin alive.
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:28:59
Cpryptocurrency will never die, that't the ponit.

That's an informal fallacy. Please also remove my username from your post as that is obviously a type of "tracking" as I cannot remove it.
I have more bitcoins then you.
Fuck PayPal.
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:40:21
No its a trap.
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:31:14
The bubble that popped.

Wow coinbase got $5m in startup funding. Your guys will be fine :) 
@_date: 2013-05-31 09:09:14
Maybe we should start a religious movement that only uses bitcoin and worships it's Creator, then we could claim religious status. :P
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:17:54
My thought is the venture capital guys cooked up this deal to get the sweet USA Bitcoin market all to themselves. Or, if you can't control the market just sue the guys making all the money.
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:02:56
Create something.

Don't run a bitcoin exchange if you don't know what your doing.

Gone are the days of using metabank.ru to convert my funds to wmz. Yay

In other words the market will fluctuate more on Monday when volume increases. @_date: 2013-04-22 02:59:42

Anyone use there services? 
@_date: 2013-05-21 08:59:51

@_date: 2013-04-14 11:25:20

@_date: 2013-04-22 02:39:10
Do you have a link to your online store? Worldwide shipping?
@_date: 2013-05-31 03:05:49
Hahaha I'll let the professionals handle the tracking of your personal information (Google).
How did you go with the whole BTC24 saga?
It's good to see the Sheep around theae parts. Plenty of bitcoin grass to eat.
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:58:30
Thanks for that. May I ask where your hemp is grown?
Edit: Just read your website found all the information I was asking. Thanks
@_date: 2013-05-29 21:58:46
There you go scrachin your noggin again. :) 
I'm not sure but I think the guy above ^ is crazy...
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:04:41
Did you start out with the intention of integrating bitcoin payments or did it come along after you where well established?
@_date: 2013-04-14 11:20:03
OKPay + BTCe
@_date: 2013-05-18 02:04:33
Sorry yahoo news must be digging through the article graveyard. They dated it May 18th. didn't read it on the register. My bad dude
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:14:19
Right. The hard part is converting the funds back into money so you can pay suppliers and other expenses. I think starting with other payment options then progressing into using BTC is the best way to go about it. Also I think bitcoins really go along well with your product (anonymous payments). 
Maybe you can answer another question for me. 
I have read that what classifies hemp as hemp is the low/non-existent level of THC, what level does it need to be kept at to ensure the plant is "hemp"?
@_date: 2013-05-18 02:18:09
I do follow bitcoin but must have ignored the article because it only effects the US market... you poor people
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:06:35
The way you said that makes me feel like you may be an employee of whollyhemp... @_date: 2013-04-15 15:20:51
Interesting, how does one determine the value of a financial instrument? How will you get users to use your system?
