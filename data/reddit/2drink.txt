So you accidentally purchased the wrong product and it's Microsoft's fault?

Beware of what? Accidentally purchasing the wrong product? How is this Microsoft's fault?

How would the bank/government know you have cash in a safe deposit box?

You must be new to bitcoin...

How are you feeling about that $1200/BTC purchase price OP?
@_date: 2015-05-17 18:48:05
It does just seem barely powerful enough for the bitcoin network now. I'm worried about that SD card wearing out from the bitcoin node.

You're a moron 
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:42:47
I hear you, however buying at close to an all time high might not be the best idea...
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:22:12


Sounds like you are saying I should promote it to me.
Sometimes it is good for people to get a different perspective and have someone play "devils advocate" especially on this sub where everyone is drinking the cool aid.

Bitcoin is like any other good in a market system. It is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.

The profits in the beginning are almost always the easiest, and the largest

There needs to be more people like you

Hate to break it to you but NO asset can sustain an all time high almost every day. Either you are a troll or you are just very ignorant to how these types of things work 
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:47:31
How is it deflationary? Bitcoin by design has controlled inflation though mining. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:27:09
That depends on a lot of factors. Are you willing to lose all of your investment? Can you feed yourself or your kids if you lose this? Will you be missing out on another, better opportunity if the money is gone? Sometimes inaction is better than action. Give bitcoin a few months to "breathe" and see where it's at.

Just remember that it was a lot easier for bitcoin to go from $10 to $1300 than it will be for bitcoin to go from $1,300 to $10,000. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:48:18
Think about it. You're saying I should promote my investment by encouraging others to purchase thereby increasing the returns of the first investors and myself. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:24:19
What are you saying that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme?
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:58:48

Gold is not currency 
@_date: 2016-06-15 01:24:19
Ok. So where is it going?

That doesn't mean that it is some sort of magical asset that will always go up in value

I certainly agree that individuals always have a choice to accept currency, and can decide based on its origin. In bitcoin and with banknotes it can be very difficult to prove the currency was used in an illicit activity. Unless someone stated that the bitcoin or cash was sourced from something illegal, I seriously doubt the receiver  would deny the exchange. 
Yes, in the same way as individuals prefer fresh banknotes, I can see the appeal of "fresh" bitcoins. Furthermore to truly have fresh bitcoin you would have to (solo) mine them. 
I worry that people could be discouraged with owning bitcoin because of the bitcoin's possible transaction history. I hope that bitcoin can be like a banknote, and be legal tender for all debts public and private.

I hate to be so discouraging but Raspberry Pis, especially the B/B+ are just barely powerful enough to make a node. The 512MB of ram fills up very quickly, the CPU gets overloaded and the SD card can wear out. Just downloading the blockchain can take a week. If you want to run a node I recommend a VPS server, heck you can even pay with bitcoin for it!  
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:11:44
This is for a bitcoin node, you do not generate bitcoin with it, it only supports the network. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:38:58
I think this is pretty ridiculous. Do people care/think of what your banknote could have been used in a transaction for? Maybe someone even snorted cocaine through your $100. With bitcoin at least I know it's never been inside someones nose (or worse). haha
@_date: 2015-07-13 19:28:41
Yes bitcoin can be traced well. However it can be difficult to know who is in control of what address, at least sometimes. 
When the FBI seized the silk road coins, there wasn't an issue finding a buyer. We all know that those coins were used for nefarious things. :)
I think when it comes down to it there will always be someone willing to pay for a bitcoin, and probably someone willing to pay slightly more for a clean coin. I just hope this premium isn't too high due to the fact that bitcoin is finite by design.

April fools. OP has a grand total of .1 BTC
