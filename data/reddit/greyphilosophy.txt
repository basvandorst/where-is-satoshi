Double spend transactions will spam the network without paying transaction fees

Yes, the underlying problem is the blocksize limit and high volume of real transactions.  However of the 30k+ unconfirmed transactions could it be that 20k of them are doublespends?

I'm going through this now with Circle.  They said I was engaged in money service business activity, but according to FinCEN if I don't meet the $1000 per person per day threshold (which I don't) then it isn't considered MSB activity.  I pointed their support person at the definition ( but haven't heard a response back yet.

Is there a quick way to analyze the transactions to see how much double spending there is in the queue?  If someone is spamming double spends that could inflate the queue without costing them a lot of btc.

Amazon for their part does a great job of filtering out fraud by limiting how much people can buy with new accounts and new credit cards, and will sometimes put holds on e-gift card purchases for a day or two when they are otherwise suspicious.  The order for the product still requires an Amazon account, which means giving Amazon a bit of personal info.
More likely someone takes a stolen credit card into a brick and mortar and buys a physical Amazon gift card with it, but even then purse will make them wait a day or two before paying them for it.
