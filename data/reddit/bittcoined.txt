"Remember I mentioned increasing the economy with merchants and buyers?"
so who's accepting bitcoins? where can I spend them right now? where will I be able to spend them next year?

Well, I think it would work best if both camps were allowed to post on either sub, because this being the internet, people are going to have the tendency to walk back and forth just to fight with each other. The little bit of rivalry and comradery both camps will experience will help make a more interesting market imo.

my argument is that bitcoin is the single most flawed currency available. my job isn't to give you a viable alternative, its to get people to realize this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:31:48
No we don't, I've implied several times that you're an idiot and that bitcoins are not an investment tool. Converting any amount of real world currency to bitcoins for any purpose other than to complete a transaction is a fools move. No matter what you say about this whole new way of thinking, you're trying to get rich off bitcoins (well, really rich off other people's money), and you're greedy, and for that people should disregard your advice when it comes to buying or selling bitcoins.

maybe not a reserve but some reliable market makers would be nice
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:36:48
ok well when that happens, I guess I'll pony up for some BTC, but why should I buy this shit now or anytime in the next year?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:51:22
I just have a hard time believing people like you are real. I hope you're not, and if you are, I hope 40,000 is a literal drop in your asset bucket. 
Hey, maybe BTC will work out and be worth a lot in years to come, but it probably won't. Be honest. Just because you want it to happen real bad doesn't mean that it will. You're so irresponsible to be going on to a website frequented by COLLEGE KIDS and encouraging them to join you at any level, especially these risky and elevated ones. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:33:19
every market needs a bear. if your currency can't stand up to criticism then you have a weak ass currency and you're a fool to put irl money into it.

Great; my money in my bank account can buy me the exact same amount of groceries that it could yesterday and the day before.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:38:46
yeah...r/bitcoin probably isn't strong enough to prop up a billion dollar market. I doubt they really mattered.

Jonathan Lebed
During the dot-com era, when stock-market fever was at its height and many people spent significant amounts of time on stock Internet message boards, **a 15-year-old named Jonathan Lebed showed how easy it was to use the Internet to run a successful pump and dump.** Lebed bought penny stocks and then promoted them on message boards, pointing at the price increase. When other investors bought the stock, Lebed sold his for a profit, leaving the other investors holding the bag.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:06:12
Do you have any experience with trading outside of BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:10:51
Listen, I just want people to stop losing important money over something as trivial as BTC. BTC prices are INSANE right now, and unless you're going to be there propping those prices with massive injections of cash (you're not, btw), I think you honestly should shut the fuck up before more real life people lose real life money.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:09:42
hopefully we won't. the reason we were able to get into triple digit prices for the brief moment we did was because of how many people were suddenly pumping money into the market place and how few people were there to meet the sudden buyer demand. People were literally taking out loans to throw into the bitcoin economy. To keep prices that high, we will have to have a CONSTANT stream of buyers buying coins with that much appetite. Until we get some real money in here (I'm talking like a roomful of billionaires) to back this currency and promise to buy evertime BTC goes under X level and sell everytime BTC goes over Y level we will never have a worthwhile currency.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:04:03
The point of living right now is to stop amateurs from listening to people like you because you clearly are in no state of mind to be giving financial advice. Look, money may not be important to you, but some of the people on here gotta eat.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:02:27
is an idiot
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:52:39
Its like all these people calling these coins worthless actually had a reason to do so
its cool that you have 1000 bitcoins, but what are you going to do about dinner/rent?

"Pump and dump" is a form of microcap stock fraud that involves artificially inflating the price of an owned stock through false and misleading positive statements, in order to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price. Once the operators of the scheme "dump" their overvalued shares, the price falls and investors lose their money.

and I'm voicing my concern over anyone putting ANY stock in BTC. It does not deserve market confidence because it has not earned it.

wait don't forget about the scammers who didn't get all their sell orders in and want you to believe its 'gonna bounce back'
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:05:45
'Slowly the merchants need to increase.'
so much speculation. what if no one else picks bitcoins up citing its numerous flaws? what then?
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:00:14
what about places where I can buy things I need, and not things I want?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:17:49
Responsibility. Granted, I probably wasn't talking to you. You maybe moved a few hundred BTC which isn't enough to shake or stabilize the economy. But the people with millions of dollars of buying or selling power AND who want to see BTC succeed should have stepped in and done their job. They're the ones who could have prevented this thing from going out of control, but instead they just sat on their dragon horde and watched people lose their shirt. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:59:44
nothing has changed in bitcoins usefulness as a currency for years now.

"Btc is more than a just currency, it is a way of thinking."
what am I reading?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:58:08
there are zero fundamentals involved in the BTC market. ZERO. Trading on them is foolish.
also, since this is an obvious promoter

Don't. Buy yourself something you will enjoy. Buying bitcoins in this environment of scammers, shady exchanges, and massive price swings in unpredictable directions makes this the equivalent of investing in scratch off tickets and trying to sell back your unscratched tickets for a premium.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:49:30
because people want someone to blame other than themselves
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:00:02
it needs a lot of money to come and and always buy it at X level, and it needs a lot of holders to always come in and sell at Y level (sometimes short if there are not enough, although this currently isn't an option on BTC). This will create stability and confidence in the 'value' of btc. Over the long term people will sneak in and start buying before the major market makers, forcing them to start buying at a slightly elevated X level. This is how a currency appreciates.

"Do you think Visas 2.3% tax isn't flawed?"
don't care, not relevant
"Going to college is a speculation that you'll get a job at a company that trades stocks that are speculated on by investors."
ok...so going to college and getting a job is bad? I don't understand how this relates to throwing money away on investments with zero promise and is only backed by other people dreams.
you're literally an idiot. you deserve every single cent of capitals gains loss you experience. I hope you only managed to convince a few people to join you. I'm done with this throwaway account.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:39:32
you're really thick if you think every major exchange and every bitcoin data scraping site going down at the same time during seemingly the largest bull/bear run in recent history is a problem on the user end.
this is the exact level of people investing/buying/hoarding bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:52:01
also, only morans have invested in facebook. I don't care if a few people did get lucky and make millions, anyone who hands cash over to that group is a tool
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:02:13
actually the saying on wall street is 'there are no guarantees' 
stop encouraging people to buy bitcoins, really. they are not an investment tool and people trying to buy right now are just fools trying to make money on a coinflip.

food, gas, shelter, water bill
face it, everywhere you spend a bitcoin requires a middle man who takes a cut out of your bitcoins when they convert if from coins to cash to goods. you're being scammed under the current system.
