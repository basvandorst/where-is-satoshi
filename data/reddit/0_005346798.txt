It is really strange how difficult it is to explain why this cryptocurrencies are the future.

I only pressed "log in". There was no transaction or something like that.
Kraken.com is working there although they are in San Francisco.

Most people I talked to asked what else they can do than buying illegal stuff at the darknet and the only two guys I know using bitcoin are doing that (but only weed;).. Of course I don't have talked with a big enough representative amount of human to reflect that to the whole world, but I would really say that at least in germany that opinion is widespread.
I really try to bring cryptocurrencies close to as much people as possible, but it's hard..

I don't think it explode but getting very slow and expensive.
When it is expensive nobody will pay in a bar with bitcoin, but then is the use for the standard citizen doubtful.
I hate that Segwit / BU war, both of them don't solve the massive power consumption problem.
This way is in my opinion a blind alley. Sooner or later we have to turn and find another way.

I hope so..
But less people with more money are more invested in structures that can't allow that decentralized free cryptocurrencies are getting to big. I think because of *their* medial power most people think *bitcoin=darknet=drugs, weapons=evil*.

I don't like Coinbase, because after I logged in one time in Iran, they immediately blocked my account and said I have to prove that I am really from Germany. So I payed my Bitcoin to another wallet and let them delete my account.
The sanctioning of certain countries is written in the AGBs, but who reads that?
However, after that Coinbase was dead for me.
I use cryptocurrencies to be more free and independent.
Everybody who have similar reasons should stop using services which creep any country in the ass / are not decentralized.

Slow compared to SEPA, 1 day+.
Power consumption compared to prove of stake for example.

To get your money back: contact the support team, if you den't have already. They are very slow but pretty friendly. I don't know what else could be done.

In my case I wrote them at the 19. August, the answer came at the 1. September ;)
The next mails came after 2-5 days.

I would spend everytime rather crypto currencies than fiat money if i have the chance to.
Just buy after it new cryptos.
This currencies have to be used to get the wide adoption. It's more than just gold.
