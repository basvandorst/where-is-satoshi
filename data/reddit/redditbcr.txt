Bitcoin only looks like it gained dominance mainly because the Altcoins are sinking way faster loosing their market share!
This is merely the merit of bitcoin but the stupidness of a market supported mostly by inexperienced private investors loosing their brains and selling off as soon as somebody is coughing.
Once more institutional money comes in, investments will be distributed more evenly and the market will mature with less Fomo.

The real money you probably loose with trading is not the immediately visible loss but the IRA potentially coming after you later for taxes.
Maybe recalling that can help you control pushing the buttons and gamble.
Every time you entered a transaction in the past you probably generated a taxable event.
Besides, don't forget, you're part of the game and blockchain is still in it's very early beginnings.
So, chillax :)

I believe that Fiat and all paper printed currencies will be history in 5-20 years from now. Some few of the current crypto currencies will evolve to be the future international used digital currencies. Whether Bitcoin or some other digital coins, future stock markets will trade probably in various digital currencies (cryptos)!
Central banks and governments will adopt and modify for their purpose available blockchain protocols and crypto technology...

Farts and weird voices....must be the excitement when Bitcoin going up or down....

Crypto market is still very small which results in high volatility. This will be normal and to be expected for quite a while. 
Once the market goes from Billions to Trillions, volatility will be less.

Agree that nobody knows.
As we move though over the years through bull runs and bear markets the crypto space is maturing a lot and we are now closer to adoption than ever.
While institutional money flows in I expect the market volatility to decrease dramatically. 
Once the train left the station we may even not experience real bear markets anymore for a long while! 
Blockchain is revolutionizing our complete society systems. Once governments and institutions give up on the old structures, everything and everyone will be focusing on the implementation of blockchain. 
This will boost the markets for a very long upward run with no significant dips.
By that time the surviving and successful Altcoins will be taking over. 
Position yourself well and diversify because profits will be exponentially higher than with Bitcoin once we get there!

Bitcoin is here to stay for a long while, I agree...as a digital storage for wealth.
Do not focus though on the coins only. It's not about that. They are just the financial vehicle for the various companies and their supporters to make money.
It's about the integration of blockchain technology in all the domains of our societies. Bitcoin is only serving a very limited purpose by being a very secure new type of financial storage, Digital Gold. 
Nothing and no technology in this planet can fullfil and excel at everything. 
All applications need to focus at one domain and be specialized to be successful. 
Bitcoin is great as a digital form of gold, decentralized and out if the reach of banks and legislations.
But, that's it!!!
Blockchain will be adopted for thousands of other purposes in human life and for that we will have plenty other blockchain companies create appropriate products. 
If you want to call all the fraudulent scam projects Shitcoins, so be it!
We should praise, as much as we admire Bitcoin, also all those great projects who inovatively strive to develop and integrate blockchain in all other domains of our life. 
There will be hundreds of successful "Shitcoins" in the future and their valuation is currently close to zero compared to Bitcoin. 
If  we expect Bitcoin to grow in value so much, just imagine how much more those "Shitcoins" will perform!

If you buy gold today it would be for investment and not for spending. Bitcoin is currently a speculative financial vehicle with the attributes of gold (digital storage) while being independent of financial institutions and state legislations. It can be instantly sent, used and transported throughout the planet without anybody's control.
Hopefully you heard about the most expensive pizza story bought with Bitcoin years ago...
I guess, until we move in crypto from a billion to a trillion market space and we still have fiat currencies available, it makes more sense to keep Bitcoin as an investment with explosive potential and withstand the temptation to spend it unnecessarily ;)
