Thanks - that answers my initial questions.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:24:36
But there has to be a way to implement a feature to lower the fees, right? Wasn’t that the purpose of SegWit? Please note I don’t know what I’m talking about or if I’m even making any sense.

USA, but anywhere in the USA is okay

We really need more exchanges that offer what a Coinbase has, or better yet, more. Hopefully some are in the works.

Almost went over my head
@_date: 2019-09-21 04:34:08
You're an idiot, they are a huge company, collecting ID on transactions over a certain limit is needed for them to stay in compliance with laws/regulations.
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:32:37
I'm not going to dive into details on how I lost them as its irrelevant and also  quite embarrassing, but do you have any helpful information?
@_date: 2019-09-08 23:29:09
Damn. Not sure if it’s worth the hassle. I’ll give it a look through though. Assuming I can’t remember, How long would that brute force take?

In my opinion, Bitcoin won't reach anything over 3k without a scaling solution. I just don't see it happening.
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:47:53
And once it hits 2000, I assume you'll make a thread saying "Lol Guys it gonna hit 2200 I told you.. !"

If I were you, I'd make the fee $10 just to be safe. Many people are waiting DAYS for transactions to be confirmed. Assuming you really are sending 1 BTC, $10 as a fee won't kill you.
This is ridiculous I'd like to add though.. I don't see this amount of unconfirmed transactions and high fees going on much longer. Expect a huge dip.

A hardware wallet in a deposit box.. I fucking stopped reading there
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:11:54
I have 4 right now. HODL until I can retire as I'm only 16. :)
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:51:13
Don't use Coinbase as a wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:57:12
I'll respond to you next week when it's down. If there isn't a huge dip, feel free to call me a fucking retard, but I'm positive there will be one. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:22:17
And when is this projected to actually execute?
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:01:33
Just give it time man,it'll confirm. Wish new users didn't have to go through this shit. We need a scaling solution really bad.

Find a trusted trader on LBC. You would much rather give a vendor your ID than a company, right?
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:44:54
Defeats the whole purpose of the currency..
@_date: 2017-05-08 22:53:02
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:44:07
Shoulda went with the Nano S.
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:05:49
Yeah it'd probably be beneficial for me to know the answer to this as well.. hopefully someone has one.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:48:34
Bitcoin will have a serious correction next week, I can assure you this.
 It's a no brainer.
People aren't going to want to pay higher fees. Look at all the threads of people complaining of high fees and the unconfirmed transactions. People new to Bitcoin are getting their first impression, and it's sure as hell not a good one. Your everyday new user isn't going to go buy 1+ BTC. Maybe $50-100 worth - and if I was that user, why the hell would I buy that in BTC when BTC is so fucking outdated? It makes no sense and these problems will catch up with the price fast.

Recommend a Ledger Nano S. Mine arrives Monday so I'm hyped.
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:17:31
I'll just write my private keys on a piece of paper and shove it up my asshole if it comes down to it. Fuck the gov.
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:44:19
This clearly shows how early we are into the game. Invest now folks and give it a few years.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:28:56
This is 2017.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:17:32
Fuck that complicated shit. Here.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:44:00
There are millions of ways to bypass this, indeed.
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:10:42
@_date: 2017-06-23 13:04:54
But this is margin trading? Fire isn't mentioned anywhere? Silly goose.

Search results are based on previous search history. Calm down before you shit your pants.

The point went over your head. Everyone wants stupid simple.
