Yeah - haven't had a chance to check my records yet cause I've been at the office, but I know mine is also right in the neighborhood of the threshold as well. Still have a k or so in coin, the rest were purchased and relatively immediately used to buy things on Amazon using Purse.io. Suppose for any microscopic fluctuation between purchase of bitcoins and purchase of Amazon GCs and the like are technically capital gains/losses that would need to be individually reported. However, over the relevant years that would work out to be a few thousand individual transactions that would need their value of the original coins calculated vs the value at the time of sale and recorded as an entry, even if it works out to a few pennies. What a fucking headache.
Also curious how it works having multiple fractional coins - do you spend them LIFO? FIFO? If you were going to go through the hours of effort to generate this, could you just choose the most advantageous arrangement at any time for you? (maximize losses, minimize gains)
The implications abound and any American buying and selling in Bitcoin, especially with Coinbase, probably needs to consider them.

I got it - it appears verbatim to the verbiage in that page, except the salutation is personalized to my name.

Because they are a library. There are significant copyright act exceptions for libraries.

There were at least ~8 of us who initially expressed interest, and more have come out of the woodwork since it was internally announced as a thing.
