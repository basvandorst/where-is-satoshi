Best parts
“As it turns out, while few people want to use Bitcoin as a currency, plenty want to treat it as an investable security, similar to gold or silver, especially while the price keeps rising.”
“This behavioral dynamic should have been clear to me earlier. In a low-interest-rate environment, when many of the fastest-growing companies are privately held and wages aren’t keeping pace with inflation, there aren’t many investments that can produce outsize returns for the average person. Many Bitcoin buyers aren’t bothered that their $100 could become $200 overnight, or crash to $10 — in fact, that’s part of the appeal.”

In the past people claimed this was somehow the fault of bitfinex, but the trend is clear across many exchanges. 
Can't blame bfx this time.

Oh they banned me. Even after todu, to his credit, noted that my post was clearly satirical. No censorship in that sub...

That's a lot of dollary-doos!

Thanks. I am mostly interested in the crypto side of new stuff (MAST, ringct, etc). Would love any recommendations 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:22:06
Yeah, people who knows things like is are always considered fair targets over there. It's not good for my mental health to go there anyway ;)

Thank you! It got me banned from rbtc :)

I was recently banned from rbtc for political satire on how they are governing their controversial hardfork. No censorship, eh?

Yes - and I love how the "unfair" scenario they cite is core adopting 2x. What a scary world they must live in if they worry about such remote scenarios. I mean, what if saddam Hussein rises from the dead and attacks 2x? Are they losing sleep over hat too?!

Oh we've played bitcoin-shitcoin before alright!

It would be funny if the onion did kind and put Ver on the cover.
But the bcashers might believe it!

And make no mistake - miners don't determine consensus. They will have a prisoner-dilemma style problem when they all want to mine 2x but 1x has a dramatically higher price. No way that wall will hold, enough of them will follow the money. And the rest will have to follow or forever compete with more profitable competitors

This is also a play-by-play of how the market will react to 2x (the market is bart)

thanks!
