This is the most important one:
**The point of the game is to acquire as much BTC as possible. Not Alts**
  Alts are a vehicle to generate BTC, that is all.  BTC is king, focus on that, don't be caught holding a bag when it dips, and it will dip

This is the first correction from 6k USD to 19k USD, this was bound to happen and is healthy.  Now that it has happened, bring on 40k USD BTC!

I did TONS of research on hardware wallets. I ulimatly purchased a Nano S.  It is awesome! I am very happy.  I chose it over a trezor due to its ability to support more than 1 type of coin and its ability for an average user to write an app for it.
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:48:24
fantastic advice.  sometimes im to eager to wait the extra 2-4 weeks tho :)
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:33:46
I fear this too.  What sort of value does BTC bring to the world? I know the blockchain brings TONS of value, but BTC... I dont think it brings much.  Its not even truly anonymous, Monero is, not BTC.  Not only that but it takes a while to confirm a transaction so using it as an every day currency is like swimming upstream
but on the flip side, the more attention and the more people that buy into BTC, the higher the price goes.  That is by design
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:29:03
Very true

How did you get two for $45?
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:18:11
not meaning to troll.  my apologies, just trying to predict the future
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:04:09
I understand that, thats why I dont store them on coinbase.  I know the purchase still occured there, but there is no record of what I did with the coins after i moved them off coinbase.  so its still 'bad', but IMO not as bad as if I store them on coinbase.
What are some 'non-record' exchange options? The only one i know of is local bit coins.  
**Bitcoin-Yoda** What method do you use to purchase if you dont mind me asking?
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:29:03
Scary, this is why its a good rule of thumb to move coins off exchanges ASAP.  Dont store your coins there ever, even for an hour.  IMO
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:22:08
localbitcoins, coinbase, kraken, bitstamp.  not in any order
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:37:05
Ya, its the first full blown BTC node in C  Its written by Nicoloas Dorier (spelling?) [one of the original Bitcoin Core developers] and the StratisPlatform team.  It was released on Jan 27th, 2017.  Its 100% compatible with the existing bitcoin blockchain, you can download the solution from GitHub, and run it as a full node right in Visual Studio if you want.
Its got all the library methods for creating wallets, and getting keys.  I think its super cool.  
Check out StratisPlatform, its a super new BaaS (blockchain as a service) company, they are endorsed by microsoft too.
Im still learning about building blockchain apps, so im not 110% certain if this is what your looking for, but I have a hunch that it is.  
Im glad you like it, check out the stratis platform, they have some cool docs and code being written
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:56:34
I have heard to many times of coins being lost on exchanges, even coinbase.  Accounts get locked, 2FA gets spoofed, etc.  Take your coins OFFLINE asap :)
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:48:12
I am a software developer so I can write any apps I want.  It gives me the freedom to do so if I wish.
It looks like Nano S supports more coins than TREZOR at the moment, they support Stratis and TREZOR does not.
I think TREZOR is great, but from the reviews I read the Nano is a more solid product speaking physically.  I have heard that the TREZOR 'feels' cheap and is plastic.  The Nano S is a tight, metal USB stick looking item.
I have read MANY reviews of people super happy with TREZOR, and I have read many reviews of people who had TREZOR and the Nano S and they like the Nano S over the TREZOR.
If you have the TREZOR, great.  If you have the Nano S great too
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:24:05
I only leave my coin on coinbase for the minimum time.  In my experience Coinbase is the easiest way for USA citizens to buy Btc.  Bitstamp needs a wire transfer and kraken has a REALLY slow UI
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:42:11
21 for sure :)

Big money there!  Blockchain is the future.
@_date: 2017-02-22 21:08:47
I hope so, so i can buy a few!
@_date: 2017-02-22 19:20:11
AH cool, do you like it so far? I have the nano S and love it
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:47:39
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:24:29
What other USA exchanges do you recommend? I havent seen any except gemini
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:35:33
also, the two 'schools of bitcoin thought' and cant agree on block sizes and other limits. There is already a rift before its publically adopted.  Just saying.  I want it to go to the m00n too, but we need to play devils advocate as well.
Judging by history it WILL go up, but we have to ask, is BTC a fad?  I know blockchain will stick around, but BTC? I dont know
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:50:09
lol so no one can buy any btc?

you are awesome, as soon as I get home from work I will implement this!!!   Thanks!

Rpi 3 here, I get the same problem.  For about 3 months it worked PERFECTLY.  now, it stalls and fails repeatedly.  I restart it, and within 2 min it stalls and fails once again.
I enabled Swap too and it did not help.
**Any suggestions?**
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:40:54
Thats horrifying.  I guess its to late to use a Hardware wallet.  Please contact the police and authorites. You need to stay ontop of the authorities if you want to see movement.  Just my 2 cents.
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:31:19
remind me 3 months

@_date: 2017-01-31 21:21:43
Talk to Coinbase, it took me a few days to get verified too.
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:15:21
What is this average you speak of?
Out of all 'common' investments out there, ETF, Bonds, 90% of stocks, CD's, and others. BTC has outperformed them all.  EVERY. SINGLE. YEAR.
I realize BTC is volatile and can crash at any moment.  Just watch the price ticker and play the long game.  It will raise and continue to raise just as it has in the past.

Is Coinbase bad?  Would you recommend we leave Coinbase and go to Gemini?
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:56:05
Why the dislike for CoinBase?  Im just wondering/learning.  Ive been a bitcoin lurker for a while and am ramping up my involvement.  Would you recommend I abandon CoinBase and go to Gemini?
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:07:02
thanks! I will, ive tried Coinbase and so far so good.  Although, I dont know the politics behind CoinBase so I dont know if there is a reason why I shouldnt like them.  But so far so good! Ill check out Gemini.  thanks!
@_date: 2016-12-07 20:46:22
Thats very cool! I didnt know that existed! Thanks for the tidbit!
Do you know of any perks/benefits of being paid in Bitcoin?  Do you convert it to USD or another currency or just hold them as BTC?  Do you get worried that the market will drop and your BTC stash will lose value?
Just curious! Thanks
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:31:55
Also had a question, where do you store large amounts of bitcoin? In paper wallets?  I think that is safe, but the chances of you losing the paper one day.... thats scary.
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:44:07
your awesome, thank you
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:31:09
Ok, Ill move them off of CoinBase.  Do you recommend cold/paper storage, or local PC stroage?
Big thanks for the advice
@_date: 2016-12-07 16:56:49
Just curious, what sort of company/employer pays in BTC?  Its very cool
@_date: 2016-12-07 21:32:40
You have really opened up my eyes, I have small stashes of bitcoin and I can TOTALLY see the perks/benefits of becoming a 'holder'.  Im sure youve seen some nice increases in your wealth ;).  Thats very inspiring!
Im going to look up those services, wirex, BitPay and others so that I can quickly convert back and forth.  Youve really enlightened me and taught me alot!
Last question:  Do you have any or recommend any failsafes?  For example the price of BitCoin was approx $730 2 weeks ago, last week it was approx $780, and now its approx $765. Do you have anything in place if the market drops to for example $600? --- Playing devils advocate here, I can see also the reason for NOT having any fail-safe, sure the price drops, but in the past it has recovered and will continue to do so.
I know the charts speak for themselves and my 'caution/concern' is generated from being un-familiar with holding large amounts of BTC.  
Thanks again for your time answering my questions, Im going to refactor how I save money and use more BTC in it :).
@_date: 2016-12-07 22:07:44
Thanks for the words/advice! I really appreciate it!

I had a re-occuring buy order of $250 monthly for the past 3 months I totally forgot about.  I found it and im up $500 :D
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:10:29
You mean when it hits $100k
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:33:43
Man this is unfortunate, sorry this happened.  I will spread the word best I can.  Crypto teams should be more supportive and show better customer service than that. 
It doesnt matter the tone you used, the fact is that it happened, and at the very least one of the team members should search through their blockchain transactions and help you diagnose what happened.  
I will spread the word and share your post
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:16:45
How much do you guys think this will impact Alt Coins in general? I can see it eliminating them if it takes off
