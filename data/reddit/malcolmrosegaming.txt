You should educate yourself on the basics. Getting owned by disreputable exchanges is unfortunately a fact of life in the crypto world unless you're careful.
[I run a site]( where you can learn about some of the safety basics, including hardware wallets, some exchanges, etc. You might check that out.
In any event, as others in the thread have said, though, Coinbase is reputable. Caveat: they are reputable in the same way PayPal is reputable - they're still basically parasitic middleman who might freeze your funds for dumb reasons. You can trust them not to outright steal your money, though. It's not an exit scam.

Why does the world need Gold ETFs? Why does the world need any ETF?
I assume you're asking this from a Bitcoin enthusiast's perspective, and I realize many Bitcoin enthusiasts don't care much one way or the other about this. You've been able to buy btc for about a decade so this might seem meaningless to you.
However, consider that the existence of crypto ETFs will expose an entire new class of investor to the crypto world. I can think of many reasons this is a good idea, not the least of which is that it will encourage interest in cryptocurrencies. In my letter I talk about how this is actually *good* for investor safety, because it eliminates a major form of fraud - people can expose themselves to some of the risks of investing in cryptocurrency (volatility, etc) without exposing themselves to the risks that come along with bad security practices (getting hacked/robbed/etc).
Of course, that last point relies on the fund managers themselves following best practices, but hopefully that's not in question.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:58:31
The thing is that one fund manager could decide one thing, and another could decide something different. As long as it's written down in exacting detail in the prospectus (i.e. the investor is informed what will happen in advanc), why not allow them to do whatever they want? If you don't like their plan for handling it, you can invest in a different Bitcoin ETF that does it in a way that's more amenable to you.
Remember that the fund manager is only deciding for the people who have *chosen* to invest in that particular ETF.
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:41:07
They had a lot of questions. I try to answer all the ones I can.
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:26:14
Well, now you're just interpreting what I said in the most unfavorable and strict way possible. Obviously I am not suggesting the wild and reckless abandonment of safety or regulations or whatever is analogous to seatbelts here. Look at this quote from the letter:
*Remember that cryptocurrencies are a brand-new asset which, if* ***regulated properly*** *, are likely to enrich our country and our markets in the long term.*
@_date: 2018-08-25 04:59:52
I wish I could say this surprises me, but I went into this with the full expectation that they would just ignore it. However, they published at least one random guy's email, so it gave me a little hope. In any event I believe that public pressure is more likely to get them to pay attention than anything. I'm hoping I can get a lot of people to signal boost this.
Glad to hear you sent them something - and sorry they've ignored you so far! The more of us working on this, the better.

Remember back in 1933 when people were using gold and silver to protect themselves against inflation and then the government bypassed that by simply making gold ownership illegal and confiscated everybody's gold?
Bitcoin is a lot harder to enforce that kind of ban on.
@_date: 2018-05-13 21:04:03
Could be, but I think it's crypto related for a few reasons. For example, several people running crypto accounts have had the same problem as me lately. Plus, their email to me suggested it was in relation to crypto.
Of course, I have no way of knowing for sure what their specific issue is because they refused to tell me. It's been almost two weeks now and they've just ignored my request for clarification.
@_date: 2018-05-14 00:07:32
Nope, wasn't promoting ICOs.


Neither Medium's regular TOS nor their crypto TOS say anything about affiliate/referral links. I think you might find affiliate links distasteful on a personal level for some reason and have assumed that they're against Medium's rules. They're not.


I didn't omit anything, you misinterpreted what I wrote. They were gone from the internet. Also, in the Patreon post I linked, I specifically said that I was able to export the articles.
Actually, you didn't just misinterpret what I wrote, you're wildly distorting it. Do you work for Medium by any chance? I included their emails to me verbatim. They didn't offer me a chance to bring my articles into compliance before shadowbanning me. They didn't even notify me that I was shadowbanned, let alone give me any warning period first. They certainly did say that I was in violation of their TOS, but refused to expand on what the actual issue was.
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:57:07

@_date: 2018-08-25 02:55:46






So, let's see. You've willfully misinterpreted almost everything I've said. You've put crazy words in my mouth. Finally you've devolved into just straight up insulting me. You could have just saved us both some time and let me know that you had no interest in a good-faith discussion from the beginning.
I think this conversation is over. You have a good day, all right?
@_date: 2018-08-25 01:19:26
In the short term, yes. However, most if not all of these reasons involve fund managers doing incompetent or irresponsible or unethical things. This is not a problem that is unique to crypto. We shouldn't block or delay Bitcoin ETFs solely because of the *potential* of something going wrong - otherwise there would be many other kinds of banned ETFs (3x leveraged spy etfs, for instance). I believe, by the way, that leveraged ETFs are a far riskier proposition than crypto ETFs and the former already exists.
In the long term, no, I can't think of any. Not if it's done right.
@_date: 2018-08-25 03:40:54
Much appreciated. Ultimately my view is that anything that increases interest in Bitcoin is a good thing in the long term. Please feel free to share this around if you want it to have more of a chance of making an impact!
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:15:28
Sure, I do have a few sections that I repeat in places - the disclaimer, the Coinbase information, etc. I don't know if I'd call it a "template" or a "slight modification" but I suppose that's a matter of opinion. This is more prevalent on the individual coin/token guides than anything else. Ironically I would have been more than happy to change these issues if they had given me a couple days to do it before shadowbanning me. Your theory makes sense but who's to say if that's really the issue? As I wrote in the article I'm not interested in playing the guessing game since they already suspended my account and then, on top of that, had the audacity to refuse to give me specifics on why.

What about the email where they specifically said to "review our policy for crypto accounts and posts on Medium" right after saying that the account was "in violation of our policies"? Does that not count?
I think it's pretty obvious that me writing about crypto had something to do with it. Was I literally "banned for writing about crypto"? I mean, maybe, but probably not. My point is that cryptocurrency enthusiasts are being treated unfairly and unduly scrutinized and censored by certain platforms such as Medium, and we should not be silent about it. If Medium is frivolously putting cryptocurrency enthusiasts through ordeals like this, people should be made aware of it.

In this case it's about consistency, not wrongs or rights. The SEC cannot, for example, believably pretend that it's consistently enforcing its rules if it denies crypto ETFs while allowing leveraged ETFs to exist.

I didn't say anything about percentages - couldn't tell you exactly how much "support" (not sure how you are defining this) anything had. It's pretty clear that the community split over this issue, though!


You realize they think the same thing about you, right? It is unfortunate that people are so quick to assume that everybody on the other side is acting entirely in bad faith. They're probably not. Neither are you - probably, anyway.


The color stayed the same. Is that not good enough? No offense, but is it possible your anger might be clouding your perceptions here? I wasn't trying to make the point you're ascribing to this graph.


I'm sorry you feel that way, but it's simply not true. For the record, this is the first thing I've ever written that extensively mentions Bitcoin Cash - in the past, I've always talked about Bitcoin. I believe that, because I don't necessarily agree with every single one of your points, you've identified me as *the enemy*. I implore you to consider that there's a more productive way to think about these situations. If I hated Bitcoin Cash as you do, I wouldn't be neutral - would I?
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:05:14
Well, the "better alternative" aspect comes from a few things. One is the fact that credit card fees are 3%, and they're almost nothing with Bitcoin (assuming the network is functioning properly). In an ideal world this translates to lower prices (smart merchants will give a discount to Bitcoin users vs credit card users).
Also, after ten minutes or so, nothing remotely like a chargeback exists with Bitcoin. This is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your viewpoint - I think it's a good thing, personally. Let's not forget that doing what we've been referring to as a "chargeback" with Bitcoin is a fairly technical thing - I doubt you'll ever see much of it.
Regarding camera footage: have you never seen a business post images of a thief online or in person? There's a head shop I walk by every day that recently put a sign up with a guy's face on it that says "this guy stole from us, please contact us if you know who he is." It's not perfect but there are avenues to work with there. Unless there's some sort of rush of people doing double spends (very unlikely to be greater than the number of people abusing the current system) this seems good enough for now.
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:32:11

From the article:
"Full disclosure: I am invested in Riot Blockchain. I’m not unbiased; I believe it’s likely that this company is eventually going to be quite profitable, and I’ve put money on this prediction."
Or did you mean the exact amounts?
@_date: 2018-06-07 17:56:47
The point is that if I were so inclined, I could regularly (maybe a couple times a month) use this mechanism to defraud almost any business, and I'd probably get away with it for a long while. Now we're just talking about the scale of fraud. Sure, I'd probably eventually get caught, but the same thing is true with Bitcoin - once I screw enough people, somebody is going to take the time to look at some camera footage and track me down or, maybe they could just take a copy of my driver's license at the point of sale.
Our entire financial ecosystem is a short skip away from the honor system, people just don't realize it. Did you know that someone could easily steal all the money out of your bank account if they knew the routing and account numbers at the bottom of your checks?
FWIW I've also *been* the merchant in these scenarios, and trust me, it's an extraordinary hassle that the merchant usually does not win. There are ways to win, certainly - but it's often a dice roll, and rarely in your favor.
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:16:14
Well, for the record, I never used the word toxic. That's a loaded, politicized word that I tend to avoid because it's often used really poorly by people who are more interested in feigning outrage than creating inroads.
All I'm really saying is that antagonizing people - by itself, anyway - usually isn't productive.
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:40:42
I don't disagree that offchain solutions sound pretty necessary in the long run if Bitcoin is to scale anywhere close to Visa/Mastercard levels.
Regarding LN: we'll see. I'm generally skeptical of any project until I see it in action, you know? At least with regards to it handling that massive level of throughput. With that said, I've definitely been researching and considering looking into running an LN node of my own - maybe I'll have it up soon!
@_date: 2018-06-30 03:23:50
Not necessarily - especially if you get into options trading.
@_date: 2018-06-07 18:41:37
Yes, the merchant certainly has options if he wants to blow through a lot of time and effort (99% of the time, he won't). It's an enormous hassle and my point is that this system is, in reality, *not* more secure nor better for the merchant than Bitcoin.
The merchant has options with Bitcoin fraud too. If I'm successful at defrauding you with a Bitcoin transaction then the merchant can review the camera footage (or take an ID at the time of the transaction) and sue me, or even ask the police to look into it. At that point you're dealing with the same wage garnishment / asset seizure / etc. that you talked about before.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:34:57
I understand you feel strongly about it. Is this kind of rhetoric helpful, though? One of my article's main points is that *both* sides could stand to have a little more politesse about these issues.

Maybe. They have the exact same thoughts about Core, though - often packaged with their usual arguments regarding off-chain rentseeking, etc. I remain unconvinced that one side or the other consists of 100% conniving greedsters.

@_date: 2018-06-07 17:31:32


That's actually false. I've done chargebacks several times and they've never asked me for proof of anything. Example: once I had some electronics fixed at a shop, and it turned out that it wasn't actually fixed. The owner of the shop refused to refund me. I called up my bank and told them what happened. It was as simple as that. Had the electronics guy produced a signed receipt it wouldn't have really helped them.
Chargebacks are incredibly easy to do and your bank and the merchant basically gets screwed over nine times out of ten. Remember, your bank is more interested in keeping you as a customer than not screwing some random merchant.
To be fair, if I started doing chargebacks constantly I imagine my bank would probably start asking questions.

Respectfully, I disagree. It *is* both sides. I don't think it's helpful to pretend that there isn't a vitriolic divide between this sub and btc - between bitcoin.org and bitcoin.com. The Bitcoin community *did* split over these issues. If you want to call BCH an altcoin, I could definitely see your arguments there. However, given the shared history and massive community split, I think it's difficult to view it as the same thing as some homegrown project like ETH or Ark.
@_date: 2018-06-21 01:21:42
Well, the whole "small blocker" thing is more of a historical term - a necessity if you want to talk about the original reasons for the fork.
With regards to the arguments, those are all real things I've seen in one form or another on the various forums. Definitely not something that's meant to be applied to all proponents of Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash, though - just examples.
I hope you're right about LN handling so many transactions easily! That sounds like a nice future. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 22:05:33
Sure, and it's reasonable to not want to rehash those arguments. Really the point of the article is more about suggesting a less vitriolic way of the two communities interacting in the future, since it's clear that the situation - such as it is - is here to stay.

I see what you mean, but it's hard for me to pretend it's not being hosted on their site. I mean, average people are going to read this and attribute a certain amount of respectability/expertise to this clown's opinions strictly because it's a Forbes link.

Haha, at first I thought you were referring to me. I was about to say, "damn dude, how do you really feel?" Yes, there have been mixed reactions to the kobold guy. Some people think it's funny, some people don't. I might change it out for other things in the future - thanks for the feedback. I may make it Microsoft Sam or something next time as you suggest.

No idea. Just woke up and just found out myself. No explanation was given. I reposted on the cryptocurrency sub so the conversation can continue.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:57:43
No, really. It's a real sub full of bitter people like you who hate Bitcoin. I suggest you go there.
@_date: 2018-11-11 23:50:28
Hey, sorry you didn't understand it. I'll try to make it clearer next time!

I wrote an [article about Square]( where I expressed some serious reservations about this. The reason is that they don't allow you to deposit Bitcoin onto your Square account to sell it - you can only sell Bitcoin that you've bought from them and haven't taken out of your account. There's really no good reason for this other than the fact that they probably don't want the added risk.
To be totally frank, I believe that Jack's foray into crypto was just a ploy to get more people to download his Cash App. If it spreads the word about Bitcoin, though, I guess I can't complain too much!

Great idea. I had meant to expand on this a little more, but forgot. I just added a little extra blurb about it. Thanks!

I'm not sure what you mean by "get value." If it's a premine, it's more centralized (tokens owned by the founding company) and the tokens might be sold in an ICO. Sometimes a coin or token can begin with some centralized aspects and move towards further (or even full) decentralization.
I've written about altcoins extensively and many of them work like this.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:25:21
Thanks! Always glad to have a fan!
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:01:44
He's right, though.
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:13:44
That's not entirely true. You're disregarding Proof of Stake coins entirely, unless you count that as "mining."
@_date: 2018-03-11 15:36:21
Thanks. Too bad the mods removed it for some reason.
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:31:32
Hi, Jason!
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:29:23


Agree. Don't worry, I'm not planning on making my platform all about attacking these sorts of clowns. I'm also not as worked up as it probably sounds, either. I'm just giving the people what they want - a lot of people seemed to have enjoyed my last shutdown of this guy, so I thought I'd push out another one since this particular article was so, well, batshit crazy. Hard to resist, you know? Plus, I'm not going to lie, it does thrill me a little that Googling this chump's name comes up with me dressing him down on the front page. Was hoping to pull that off again here.

Possible the account is run by a bot.
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:23:17
It's probably less about the details and more about who you've bought off. The SEC is a notoriously corrupt organization.
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:56:36
Almost everything you said will be simultaneously accepted and challenged depending on who you say it to, so it's hard to say "you're right" or "you're wrong."


The BCH creators would say so, yes. Core supporters might suggest more nefarious purposes.


The BCH supporters would say so, Core supporters might deny it or suggest that instances of this are due to far less traffic on the BCH blockchain.


Sort of. Everyone who had BTC at the time of the fork also has BCH. It really is a matter of ideology at this point, if you ask me.

No offense, but I just don't believe you. Your first post is dripping with political animus to such an extreme degree that I think just about everything is political to you. Whether you dislike the guy or not, he's a very powerful figure saying good things about Bitcoin - this is good for Bitcoin. Just about anything that brings attention to Bitcoin is good for Bitcoin.


Cool opinion, but have you considered that your political adversaries could find a similarly dismissive thing to say about you? Let's be honest, it is a political statement.
@_date: 2018-07-17 16:49:53
Nice! I'd like to suggest that if you continue to do this, you could also point people in the direction of [this article I wrote]( I specifically tried to write this for people who know nothing about btc and are starting from scratch - have had some newbies tell me it was very helpful to them in starting out.
@_date: 2018-07-23 06:10:21
Yes, there are lots of reasons BTC is good for the USD. Hence the thinking man emoji :)
@_date: 2018-07-23 05:42:42


@_date: 2018-07-21 17:16:23
I really wish you wouldn't bring your politics here. Bitcoin is largely apolitical and there are many reasons for people on both sides of the aisles to like it.
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:12:13
The Petro has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It's basically a scam to prop up a failing government. I've written about the difference between the two [here](
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:48:32
My accountant suggested that like-kind exchanges are a really bad idea for crypto. Just my five cents.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:49:40
Nice. Glad to hear it from the horse's mouth. Thanks for commenting!
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:38:13
(Note: I am mostly neutral in the whole scaling debate &amp; forks issue, so take this post as such).


Begging your pardon, but I don't think this is copacetic to what they've been saying about it. I'd say that "digital cash" is more accurate assuming you want to believe them. Digital platinum would imply they have a strong focus on the coin being a store of value and I'm not sure if that's high on their agenda at all.

HitBTC is notoriously slow. I've been waiting on a support ticket from them for months. There's a reason I always recommend Binance over them in my articles. 
There are good reasons to use HitBTC, but mainly it's to make trades when superior exchanges are down, or trade particular coins or tokens that don't trade on many other exchanges.

That would be good news, tbh. He should continue not watching the last episode of GoT. In fact, if he skips the entire final season he will be a lot happier.

On [my website]( my summary reads:
**Bitcoin is a worldwide virtual currency (“cryptocurrency”) you can send for little to no fees which is not controlled by any government, corporation or individual.**
