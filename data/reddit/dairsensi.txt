Fiat currency can be dated back to as early as 11th century China as a receipt for strings of coins made out of base metals. The reason why the coins have holes in the middle was because they were put on a string. A string of 1000 coins was worth about 1.2 ounces of silver. Chinese emperor Wu-ti also had fiat money made from deerskin because he was running out of physical coins to continue his war campaign. How about a more recent example? Congress passes the National Currency Act in 1862 under Lincoln and the introduction of the "greenback" dollar goes into circulation, alongside the United States dollar. Yes, we had two different dollars at the same time. One was backed by gold and had more purchasing power than the other, the other was not backed by anything. Guess which one ended up biting the dust... The concept of fiat money is thousands of years old and history is filled with them, every single one of them collapsing. The book Fiat Paper Money: The history and Evolution of our Currency by Ralph T Foster would be a good place for you to start and literally gives you dozens of examples. The spine of the book has strips of actual fiat currencies attached to it that have failed in the past. So your first comment is just flat out wrong due to ignorance. Your second comment just proves my point, lol. What is money supposed to be? A store of wealth that can be exchanged. What is gold? A store of wealth that can be exchanged.

I don't believe Trump is unaware of what printing more money does. It's a race to the bottom. But since the federal reserve note is the reserve currency, it would be the last to go down because of how this fiat system is set up. Printing more dollars would just speed up the entire process and cause a chain reaction around the world. Him announcing that publicly seemed like a threat to the banking cabal. The last thing they want is for the economy to start flushing while Trump is constantly pointing the finger at them when he's been using their tools against them the entire time. They have effectively put themselves into a corner because another round of "quantitative easing" would most likely make this house of cards collapse. All through out history when a major fiat money system finally collapses, it always goes back to a gold standard. Until enough time goes by and politicians can convince people gold isn't money. They go back to fiat and it eventually collapse again. The cycle constantly repeats. Study monetary history. Going back to gold isn't an if, it's a when. Why else do you think China has been buying up gold mines around the world for the past decade? Why else do you think central banks around the world have been buying gold and trying to get their gold back from other countries? Because they got nothing else better to do? Use your head and think logically. They are getting ready for the transition. The only thing that is different this time around is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not going to replace gold, it will supplement it. Paper money will go back to being gold backed, and Bitcoin will reign King as the gold standard of crypto.

99.99% of all of you completely missed what he just announced in that tweet. Ignore the Bitcoin part. Look at the very end. None of you own UNITED STATES DOLLARS. You own FEDERAL RESERVE NOTES. The two are not the same. The US dollar is issued by the Treasury, not the Federal Reserve. It is also backed by gold. He just let you know what is coming in the future. If I remember correctly, Kennedy had them printed before his assassination to get out of the control of the Federal Reserve. They were never released and are still there.

No, they are transacting in crypto. The 3rd party payment processor is the one doing the converting. You only pay taxes when you are the one doing the converting. Which would be dumb on your part unless you really needed to pay for something in cash and crypto was not an option.
