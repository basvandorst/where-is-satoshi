Men I'm really interested in to get info about this kind of platforms, if you can tell me more like this would be nice. The system is call parimutuel betting.  I just want to know if somebody tryed that. I m new in bitcoin and i don't want to lose my few earnings received from  faucets and cloud mining in a scam. That site seem serious, but i just want to know if sombody tryed or can give me his opinion. I m wondering to go to quora... they are not that peaky with your first question, you ask they answer.

I like when people replies to this sarcasm taking it seriously XD. Is like when people blame in those funny websites that post fake but very creative news.

I think that is reasonable to want to get profitability from your ideas.. but i think the world must to be oriented to business models where  being rich is not the main goal, because then the scam, the corruption and the opression come. To compliment the great idea itself must be more popular rather than the raw money, even more if we talk about Bitcoin enviroment.

HI! BTW it seems that the  Onehash is popular among russians. Anybody knows russian? one  guy created this video.
The answers are saying that the rates are quite big... in fact this La Liga bet seems quite interesting..  Barcelona 1/3.. is so tempting

Hehe Wow! they are pioneers in the cryptocurrency world XD. 
Anyway if people like the Winklevoss start to put their hands in the Bitcoin environment, the influences and politicians are going to do it too, so Bitcoin project will fail.
