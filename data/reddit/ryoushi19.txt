You're confusing what could have happened with what did happen.  **Based on what we knew in 2013** it was absolutely conceivable that he could have lost his home on this investment.  Bitcoin has shown extreme volatility before, and if he had invested during a spike in price and then hit a subsequent slump, he would have lost his home.  That's not what **did happen**, but it's a thing that **could have happened**.


No, it wasn't.  Bitcoin has shown to be a very volatile currency before, with extreme price drops on occasion.


Now you're going into philosophy and raising a few questions about determinism that are beyond the scope of this conversation.  Specifically, it might be worth asking whether randomness exists in the first place.  Regardless, isn't an unknown element still a bit much when your entire house is on the line?


It might be if it could cost you literally everything you have if things don't happen the way you expect!


But he **was** speaking in 2013 when he chose to make this investment.  Should I also say that someone who makes a risky bet in sportsbook but wins a fortune is smart for doing so just because he won?  NO!  He was **lucky**.  Just like this guy.
EDIT: fixed a "you're" to a "your"

That just makes him a lucky idiot.  He easily could have lost his house on the gamble he took, but he got lucky.
