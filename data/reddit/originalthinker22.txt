Don't mine bitcoin itself, not profitable. Download nicehash instead. It mines whatever cryptocurrency is most profitable at that moment given exchanges/your hardware and pays you out in bitcoin. Profits have taken a drop lately but are still far above electricity costs.

I didn't say that at all, I know comprehensive reading can be difficult.

Fair enough
