I know a few of those words.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:31:14
It's more likely that *all* Bitcoin wallets will be removed from the App Store.
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:30:46
The walled garden is Apple's thing. It's the reason they do what they do with iOS. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:04:48
f.lux has been around since iOS 2, and before that on PCs. 
Who am I kidding, it was all Apples idea.
@_date: 2016-08-12 07:34:08
What does it mean by "sigop"
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:15:47
geth light client. It's CLI though, if you're allergic to the terminal.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:39:03
What are you on about? I've had no issues sending BTC between my wallets with less than $1 in transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:03:23
I'd like to split my mining operation to half block mining and half transaction verification, but I honestly have no idea how to setup ASIC miners to mine transactions. Google isn't much help either. Any advice?
@_date: 2015-12-10 16:00:40
What's the hashrate on it?
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:11:09
Not ragging on you or anything, but I really don't get how paid camgirls are a thing. Like... You can watch literally any type of porn you want for free on the internet. ELI5 why they're still a thing?
Edit: These downvotes for asking a genuine question. Good shit.
@_date: 2015-12-04 20:55:52
Is it that personal when there's multiple guys watching one person?
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:51:18
I have free electricity, so it's all good haha
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:38:53
I definitely will :D
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:32:32
I didn't know what people were on about when they say bear/bull market. This will help me remember, thanks op.
I still think it's a really *really* dumb way to refer to it, but I just have to accept it I guess
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:00:52
Yes, and "cryptocurrency" is a portmanteau of cryptography and currency. So my point still stands
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:16:15


That's quite the assumption
@_date: 2018-08-24 15:06:48
"Cryptocurrency portfolio" is way too many syllables. "Crypto" is a perfectly valid shorthand
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:51:51
Does the Nano S work with phones? How would you plug it into your phone?
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:41:50
Sounds cool, why wouldn't you want that?
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:14:57


I don't care, fuck those people.


You can have areas that are predominantly one culture within the same country.


Ideally the people. It would be a democracy.


Well, that would depend on how the people vote.


I don't know what "Marxist" means, but equality of opportunity would be great IMO. Again, this would depend on how people voted though.


I don't know who or what any of these nations are (I mean, aside from London). I personally don't see any problem with it as long as the laws are fair.


That's what state/regional governments are for. They'll be the testing grounds.
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:51:23
If it gets stolen/broken then RIP. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:52:59
I believe it's 1 satoshi. Could be wrong though.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:05:00
Probably was intentional. I got to the marker, stuck on validating. Is it supposed to throw an error if it can't validate or will it be stuck on it forever?
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:17:21
So in theory, as long as there's people using Bitcoin to make transactions, there will always be a reason to mine?
@_date: 2016-03-17 13:58:05
I work on government computers, and I used to browse wikileaks at work all the time before it was blocked. You're probably fine.
@_date: 2017-02-07 15:40:19
I'd say BTC is pretty convenient to use. I've never had a problem with it anyways.
@_date: 2016-03-14 14:04:22
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:16:48
So you know, USAA is restricted to military members and their immediate family.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:55:54
Working on it. Not sure what happened but the app is crashing on map load. I'll keep you updated.
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:15:52
They've always been above other banks. If they weren't restricted to military members, it would shock the banking industry.
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:15:41
What would you recommend as an alternative with similar functionality? As in extreme ease of use, bank account linking, buying and selling BTC, multiple wallets under one password, etc.?
@_date: 2017-03-01 23:18:48
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:01:58
Love the app, was a bitch to get around that 9.1 requirements though. Don't want jailbreakers using your app?
@_date: 2016-03-07 18:46:30
No, I've gotten to that menu, I just don't have the option to add my Coinbase account.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:44:28
And was able to spoof location. Your protection is good though, I doubt many people will be able to bypass it. I recorded a video showing it off.
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:41:41
What's to believe? It's in the constitution. 
@_date: 2016-03-07 17:29:59
You should be fine then
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:17:03
I don't see this option on my account. What gives?
@_date: 2016-03-07 16:15:13


Hey man, I use USAA, and I'm no warmonger. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:01:31
Yeah I live in America. We can speculate all we want but the citizens elected the president, the citizens voice their opinions, file patents, propose bills, run unions, etc. I don't know what evidence you're basing your assumptions on.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:29:45
You should still set your requirements to iOS 9.0 I think. Works fine on 9.0.2 once I bypassed the jailbreak detection.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:53:47
Nah, they can just sell the BTC for cash or something.
@_date: 2017-03-01 17:01:30
The government is made of citizens. The populace control the government, not the other way around. It *is* a democracy, assuming you're talking about America.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:50:04
How does locking accounts have anything to do with Government restrictions?
@_date: 2016-01-22 18:59:57
You can fake your location on mobile.
@_date: 2016-11-01 13:10:36


Something more worthwhile than ASICs. It's much more worth it to buy straight up BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:22:21


Yes, *as a currency*. Buying shit, selling shit. I have all but completely given up the USD apart from a few bills that refuse to take crypto. I do grocery shopping with crypto, pay rent with it, buy secondhand with it, etc.
It is useful, and in my opinion preferred to fiat.
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:39:15
No conversion needed, when I use crypto, it's crypto to crypto. My local grocery store takes Bitcoin and ETH, tons of online stores take crypto, my landlord takes crypto for rent, my ISP takes crypto, there's a gas station on the way to work that takes BTC, ETH, and Dogecoin of all things, and I also get paid in mostly ETH

Mining equipment.
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:17:14
Neither did mine. 1btc=1btc
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:22:37
It's not my fault that the USD and all other world non-crypto currencies have fluctuated so much in comparison to BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:09:36
Crypto is a *currency*. A medium of exchange for goods and services. I wish people would stop thinking of crypto as an investment, a gamble, or anything else than what it actually is.
@_date: 2018-06-21 22:17:17
I live in a decently large city in Texas. Well, right outside of the city.
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:10:15
Most Americans are doing just fine. Poor people probably aren't getting into crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:27:35
Same thing that makes gold have value
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:32:40
Well I guess in a way that makes BTC even more stable than jewelry. The price of BTC isn't dependant on such a small number of things.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:00:35
Black market stuff, groceries, electronics, picture frames, video games, RuneScape gold...
I mean practically anything. It's a very versatile currency. I get paid in BTC, pay my bills with BTC, buy groceries and.. well pretty much everything with it. The only recurring thing I have to exchange for fiat is my water bill.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:21:49
Because I believe in the currency, I think that the world would be a lot better if we all switch to something decentralized. I am being the change I want to see in the world
@_date: 2016-02-17 16:06:49
It's all encrypted, and is decrypted by the bootloader. So no. You could break into it and get root access, and also remove the passcode entirely by jailbreaking it.
@_date: 2016-02-17 15:41:34
@_date: 2016-02-25 22:20:48
Oh wow, I really thought that the huge jump to $1000 was due to the halfening.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:37:20
The price of bitcoin will likely skyrocket. Last halfing saw prices of over $1000 per 1 BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:40:46
Ubiquity. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:15:51
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:49:12
I disagree. Capitalism can do just fine when everyone has a communistic/socialistic mindset. If we all work together and actively try to be fair to each other and not fuck each other over just for profit, capitalism will still work just fine.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:41:42
Oh, I guess I forgot that the very end of Z took place so far in the future. It's been a good decade since I've seen Z all the way through. I gotta watch through Kai at some point.

Uub was only in Dragon Ball GT IIRC, which isn't even canon, so..
Edit: I was wrong
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:26:01
Oh right, forgot about that. I wonder why he hasn't been in Super at all... He could have been great in this most recent tournament arc.
@_date: 2018-03-16 15:21:56
Oh, so *that's* why the exchange rates wont make up their minds.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:33:41
Capitalism is not an ideology, it's an economic system. This is independent from moral considerations. You can be for capitalism, but against being a cunt.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:57:15
Well no, not really. I want to use crypto, any crypto. I find decentralization far more appealing than traditional currency. That said, I want to choose the coin that has the highest rate of adoption/acceptance. Right now, that is BTC. I can see ETH taking BTC's spot in the future, but for right now Bitcoin is the king of crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:07:51
"Capitalism" is not a defense for being a cunt.

Cryptography will adapt to the new powerful processors just as it always has
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:19:11
I know that miners don't care, but I do.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:01:45
I didn't know anyone aside from Alex Jones used the term "globalist" unironically.
Also, what in god's name is a globalist?
@_date: 2018-07-02 20:55:09
Hey so... What does this mean? What is a custodial service in this context? What institution's money?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:29:44
Even untrained I feel like he could have been much more powerful than Tien. To be fair, for most of the tournament, experience and battle instinct have mattered more than raw strength. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:06:16
Why is that? Why would it matter the reason for moving there?
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:07:37
What is the problem that these are trying to solve? What is this "scaling problem"? 
What does the size of the block matter? Why can't the block have a variable size that scales infinitely based on the number of transactions?


What does this mean?
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:07:33
You say that like its a bad thing. I love socialism! Not complete socialism mind you. Socialism with a bit of capitalism would be fine by me.
@_date: 2016-10-25 20:11:24
Fair enough. Didn't realize it was so small.
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:00:21
How do we use oil for agriculture? And why couldn't this be replaced with a form of renewable energy?
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:21:57
Yeah, what's stopping us from slowly converting those tools and plants into using solar/wind/nuclear?
@_date: 2016-07-31 06:31:52
Anecdotally I am. Although I broke this app wide open. I messaged the dev telling how I did it and he never fixed it.
