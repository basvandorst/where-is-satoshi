From gdax to my private wallet.

What if you only have a small amount and dont want to pay large miner fees? E.g say I have around 0.5BTC on an exchange, what sort of fees should I expect to pay?

One other question dude, is it worth withdrawing small amounts with the fees you have to pay miners? Looks like I got charged 13 dollars for a 2k withdrawal?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:55
Would you regret the decision if BTC rises to 100k+?

He literally says "enough to pay off the house"

Ok, BTC is up 147% since last month, Ethereum is 104% and LTC is 350%. What is your point?

Do you mind if i ask you two questions?
1. Can you tell me how to determine what fees were paid on this transaction?  
2. How can you choose the speed at which something gets transferred as mine was done in 20minutes?

He's basically saying he expects the value to considerably drop and even out.

Transferring to Jaxx! I put my LTC and ETH in there, then when I did BTC it just hasn't appeared in the wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:33:52
Strange comment considering both of those alts are also considerably dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:58:24
Well he said 30 days ago, so that time period.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:27:48
OK got it. I had to restart Jaxx, I was pressing that refresh button all the time and nothing, but after restarting I saw it came through 30minutes ago.
Thanks so much for the help, and good luck with your unconfirmed transaction.. looks like a weird one. Wish I could help.

I mean miner fees when transferring to my private wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:11:39
Can you explain what these sell walls are for a dummy like me please?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:15
Did you really? I'd be interested to know your thoughts after selling at that and seeing it 3x that now. Why did you even consider selling then? Mental.
