Just like gold.

A lot of commodities are useful in many industries. But I don’t see many people buying aluminum or copper to use as SOV. Nor I see their price being linked anything but their industrial use, while gold price is mainly driven by speculation. The quantity of gold used in electronics is negligible compared to what’s used for SOV.

The craziest and most positive bitcoin price prediction puts it @ $1M, which is about 83 times more than it is today.
If that crazy prediction came true (noone really believes it, but nobody has a crystal ball either), your $40 would turn into $3300.
Whether that would be a good chunk of money or not, it's up to you.
The days of 1000x gains are gone for BTC. If you are after that, you should look into some cheap altcoin and hope.

Onto you. You show up with new shoes, they confiscate them because they assume you got them with illegal money.
@_date: 2019-11-10 05:46:08

It’s easy to store because it doesn’t corrode. The infatuation started millennia ago, when it was the only thing that would shine without eventually rusting.
@_date: 2019-11-07 15:33:01
If you sent it to a merchant, you’ll have proof of what you purchased and maybe an invoice. 
If you sent illicit funds to a family member... you’re still on the hook.
@_date: 2019-11-06 18:31:19
Doesn’t matter: as soon as the coins leave your address, they’ll be onto you.
@_date: 2019-11-06 20:25:47
Im not familiar with this technique: surely at some point the coins will leave the address, right?
I mean I could even just give the private key to someone for the equivalent of the the money,  but only a fool would accept that.
@_date: 2019-11-06 18:48:47
That line of defense will work as long as you don’t show up with a new car, house, or whatever you bought with your coin. It will look suspicious as hell and they’ll ask you to prove you did that purchase with legit money.
@_date: 2019-11-06 17:55:27
If you lost them, ok, you can write them off as a loss. But if you ever recover your password, good luck ever spending them. They’ll be watching that address and they’ll be on you as soon as they see a movement there. 
Bitcoin isn’t as anonymous and private as a Swiss bank account. Remember, it’s all on a public ledger.
@_date: 2019-11-09 20:39:05
Are you serious about the shoes? If all you have in crypto is actually only $30, nobody is ever going to seize them. You have nothing to worry about. 
But if you have large amounts of money that they suspect you obtained through illegal activities, they’ll bend every rule and stomp on every right you have to seize them. And you can’t spend it without them noticing. Not in a western country, at least. They got Ulbricht Bitcoin. 
People who believe that they can hide “house money” from the authorities through crypto are delusional. Well, yes you can probably hide it but you’ll never be able to spend it in a western country. If you really need to hide money, get a bank account in Panama or some tax haven.
@_date: 2019-11-06 17:56:48
The only way they can’t know, if you bought them for cash OTC or from an ATM.
Any other way, and they’ll know.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:45:53
I’m not moving the goalpost. It’s just that law enforcement isn’t a bunch of idiots and they will find ways to legally seize your Bitcoin if they want to. You can’t keep them at bay with some petty excuses.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:36:46
It’s not much different than having your money in a regular bank account, then.
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:10:16
Ehm no, it shows right here in the blockchain that the BTC is still there where the exchange sent it when you withdrew it.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:32:34
So, what the difference in just receiving your paycheck in fiat then use it all to buy BTC? Maybe you can avoid taxes that way?
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:18:24
The one you bought on an exchange that has KYC
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:35:56
Good luck ever using them again, then. Your coins are being watched.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:35:23
Well you’ll have to explain to a judge how you sent money from your bank account to the exchange, to which you’re personally registered, then withdrew then to an address that isn’t yours and to which you have no access. Why would you do that?
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:15:41
I’m told Mars doesn’t have any law.
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:27:09
No, I’m not saying that. I’m saying that if the law enforcement of your country, any country, suddenly decides to seize your assets, they will seize your BTC too. BTC isn’t totally safe, which is what the OP was about.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:40:30
Oh, you have new shoes? I have reason to suspect they were bought with illegal funds, let me confiscate them until you can show me how you legally bought them.
@_date: 2019-10-27 03:37:41
Offshore bank accounts, like in Panama for instance, seem to be quite safe. OP statement seems to be much more idiotic than mine.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:30:24
I’m talking about coins that have already been widthdrawn from the exchange. You can’t deny they are yours, since the exchange keeps track of the address they sent it to.
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:09:07
The criminals in prison disagree.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:41:30
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:24:38
What about Ross Ulbright? Somehow they did manage to seize his 700k BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:33:36
What if it was a crypto bubble this time.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:37:28
What does US law have anything to do with this?
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:31:09
Good luck spending them, then. They’re closely watched, they will be on you as soon as you move them.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:27:01
How? Who would buy coins that are so closely watched?
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:09:48
Wherever you are, you are subject to some state law.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:47:03
Oh you had cash money, I thought you said we already seized it all!
Anyway, I wish you good luck with that line of defense. They’re not idiots and if the law is going to be bent, it’s on their side. If they want your crypto, they will get it.
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:16:14
On that I totally agree; if they don’t care about taking your money, your money is safe.
@_date: 2019-06-17 15:29:53
And if price won't go up, the miners will turn off their rigs and it won't be possible anymore to do transactions.
Price will go down because noone wants to own some digital gold that can't be sold.
I think OP raised a very valid question. I know the timeframe is beyond most people lives, but if BTS is to challenge gold as a store of value, the prostectives need to be crystal clear for the next centuries, as they are with gold.
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:08:31
By those who you are trying to hide them from.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:38:19
They’ll want to see receipts or invoices for those transactions, then.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:23:43
They did confiscate Ross Ulbright’s coins.
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:20:03
So, did you agree on a fixed amount of BTC for your compensation, or did you agree on a fixed amount of fiat and convert to BTC every time a payment is due?
@_date: 2019-06-03 14:24:27
Don't leave us hanging ! I don't have the competence to understand code. What's frightening about it?

Where are those whites from?
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:58:38
Wow, does he still own those 600k BTC? 
That's a huge sum. I wonder if they eventually managed to seize them, or if he stil controls them, or if they have to be considered lost coins.
Anyway, double life sentence without parole for non-violent crimes? and all the bank CEOs that cause the 2008 crash walked away with huge bonuses? Justice is fucked up.
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:09:53


That’s not the same thing. If you lock in a contract in BTC, the gamble is that if the BTC price goes up, so does your salary. 
Let’s say you now earn $1k/week. You sign a contract for .1BTC / week. That’s the same thing now, right? Because 1 BTC is now about $10k. So now let’s suppose that next year BTC has risen to $50k. You’re still earning .1 BTC / week, which you can sell right away for a cool $5k every week! I think this is the only reason to ask to get paid in BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-11 20:32:08
Care to elaborate? How does one who controls half the hash power doesn’t control bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-13 06:41:21
That’s just a gamble. Not everyone believe that BTC will moon eventually. If the employer doesn’t believe that BTC will go up, he should sign that contract and potentially end up paying just peanuts.
@_date: 2019-09-10 05:21:01
It makes some sense then. I had just skimmed through his wiki page. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-09-03 07:30:13
Exactly. 
Well since global adoption is at way less than 1% (only about 34 million active wallets), today even if you own even 1 sat you’re already safely in the 1%. 
The .28 figure is works even if everyone on Earth owned some satoshis.
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:11:40
The point of being paid in BTC is that you want to fix a BTC amount and hope that by the time you’re paid it will be worth more Fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:07:03
If you own .28BTC you're mathematically sure you're in the top 1% of the world population, as far as BTC ownership goes..
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:47:32
Exactly. At best, it's clickbait. Noone loses 100k and the first thing he does, before even telling his family, is write a comprehensive article with wonderful infographics.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:10:58
Easy, just convert all your dollars into another currency. EUR, GBP, JPY, CNY, BTC... your pick.
@_date: 2019-05-19 06:53:33
So you’re saying that Satoshi’s wallet is up for grabs!
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:37:59
I can assure you it’s the former.
@_date: 2019-05-26 12:59:06
Because they are betting that BTC value is going up. If they lock the salary amount in the contract in BTC and the BTC value goes up, their salary value goes up too.
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:57:09
I think the most likely failure mode is new coins made by giants like Amazon or Facebook. If they come out with a coin that is easy to use and that doesn’t scare people, everyone will use it and no one will remember Bitcoin.  
Imagine being able to buy Amazon coins on Amazon and having a discount if you use them to buy there. Instant adoption from billions of people, bitcoin lives on as used only by nerds and hodlers.
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:05:24
Same goes for Euros.   
SEPA transfer to Coinbase, move EUR to Coinbase Pro to because it has lower fees, buy BTC, withdraw BTC to your personal wallet. Once the SEAP transfer has cleared (usually 2 days), it takes just a few minutes to have your BTC in your wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:22:33
If you own 0.28 BTC and you consider the whole human population, you are mathematically certain of being among the top 1% bitcoin owners.
@_date: 2019-05-21 09:01:40


I never understood this. Yes it has good corrosion resistance, good electrical conductivity, and good ductility and malleability. But even in this aspects it's not that much better than aluminum, which has much better mechanical properties per unit of mass. So, how is intrinsic value so much better than aluminum? is it because it's rare? Well Rhodium  (among several other metals) is rarer AND can be used to make cathalict converters, it should be an even better investment, right?
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:32:25


Exchanges profit a lot of money from having lots and lots of money sitting there in their user's accounts. Just like banks.
@_date: 2019-05-26 15:19:08
Thanks for your insight.
@_date: 2019-05-19 07:04:16
I don’t think you are right. 
I think that exchanges own their own huge wallets full of bitcoins and your bitcoins are just in your exchange account. When you withdraw you are sent your bitcoin from the exchange wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:18:10
That’s because accepting credit card payments costs commissions for the seller. Accepting bitcoin doesn’t. 
Still, I would be more glad if the price was in Bitcoin and not in dollars. They’re just taking advantage of Bitcoin as a payments system and not as a legitimate currency.
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:48:26
That's because it didn't really happen. It's advertising for hardware wallets, or at best it's clickbait.
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:15:58
1)you’re making a lot of assumptions about how those Amazon/Facebook coins will be
2)how it will be it actually irrelevant IMO: with those huge names behind, people will just adopt them the same way they adopted Amazon, Whatsapp and Facebook, and the value of Bitcoin will drop. 
All this strictly IMO. It’s not what’s probably best for the world, but I think it’s what will likely happen. Obviously I can be completely wrong.
@_date: 2019-05-23 19:55:27


Wouldn't you just just see the new address and its balance when you create an online wallet with your private key?
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:15:40
Seems like they just accept it as a mean of payment and don’t actually recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate currency. The price is still in dollars after all, even if you pay with Bitcoin. 
Still, better than nothing.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:03:49


Alas, that’s probably not going to happen for most of the world population.
@_date: 2019-05-21 08:29:30
What I can't believe is this guy being robbed of 100k and then, even before telling his family.... writing a well worded article with perfectly executed infographs and tips on how not to repeat his mistakes.  
I mean who the hell does this. If it happened to me and felt the need to take this thing online, I'd write just a "just got fucked on coinbase, don't leave your money there" post and that's it.
Seems to me like clickbait. Good points are made all around the article, but it's clickbait.
@_date: 2019-05-26 13:01:45
I don't know why you're being downvoted
These guys are betting that the BTC value will go up, and take up their salary too. While I do agree that eventually BTC will go to the moon, betting that it will do so in the timeframe of these guys new contracts is a gamble.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:07:47
Thanks for the welcome. I actually am new here.
Let me explain why I wrote what I did a couple of posts above.  
The success of Bitcoin and its value are directly related to its adoption. If only a few millions use it, it's going to be a lot less successful if half the planet adopts it for its everyday transactions and savings.  
So, what are the biggest obstacles to Bitcoin widespread adoption? In my opinions they're:
1)general lack of trust from the general customer (there's plenty of people who still think that using a credit card on the internet is dangerous, let alone Bitcoin which the medias paint as the money of criminals)  
2)access barrier from the non-tech savy
What I think is that if one huge company with an established brand and a clean reputation (for example, Amazon) made a tool to handle currency that was very easy to use and very easy to trust (because there's a big name behind), and maybe pushed it through heavy incentives (like only a huge company could do, for example selling products under cost if paid with their coins), then many people would handle those coins and then they would end up using them for more transactions.   
This hypothetical "amazon coin" could still be based on the same blockchain technology as Bitcoin or as most other coins, so with the same characteristics of decentralization, openness, immutabilty that Bitcoin has, so all you just wrote would apply to it too. 
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:58:21
What if those giant pushed a decentralized coin?
What if people actually preferred to go with a “controlled” currency (and this reliable in their eyes, because it’s a name they trust) instead of a decentralized one?
I’m not saying at all that the world would be better off with a facebook or amazon coin. All I’m saying is that that’s the way it could go.
