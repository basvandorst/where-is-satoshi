It’s not instant from your bank. It’s instant between your Coinbase to GDAX accounts.

Couple weeks ago. Transaction ID c73ce02221d79cebd399e5ef3a3647e1fbfed04cfbae6c396de1828c8fbe7827. Received at 5:34pm and confirmed in block 496489 at 8:31am the next morning. So not days, but many hours for sure.

fuck that's nice

It’s pronounced ��️enis 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:50:40
I'll buy it for 0.73 BTC

Cmon, that QR code isn’t readable. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:15:36
Oh sorry I misread your original comment. I thought you were implying that the email list was insecure and therefor so are the private keys. My bad!
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:58:32
Price is going up right now because supply&lt;demand. If millions of BTC came back into circulation supply would potentially become greater and would cause a huge dip.

That's the public key. OP said the private key is locked up elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:01:05
I paid for a ledger nano s and the transaction took days to process but it still accepted the order and shipped just fine. Now it’s loaded with my coins and locked away! I don’t know what 15 minute window you’re talking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:34:18
Have you tried turning it off and then back on?
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:50:11
But if the private keys weren’t encrypted then why would the scammer bother to send out spam instead of directing their energy towards stealing those keys just like they did with the email list?
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:15:09
Sorry for the misunderstanding!
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:27:05
Woah that's a ton. Have any good sites I can use to see that kind of info?
@_date: 2017-11-18 17:05:38
RIP in peace ✌️ 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:56:43
You ok?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:45:24
There’s a zero balance :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:27:57
I have all my BTC in Breadwallet. How do I go about splitting it into BTC/BCH so I can sell the BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:27:58
Oh I didn't know that! Thanks for the info!

New account as of 4 hours ago. The CSS in this sub is just fucking with it I think. Mine frequently switches between 4 weeks and 7 weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:26:38
Sweet, thanks! :D

Mobile adblocker?
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:02:25
Thank you for the suggestion! Sorry I took so long to reply, but I did end up using Tails! My bitcoin is now officially backed up and I can rest easy knowing that if my apartment gets set on fire I’ll still have a copy in my second location!
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:34:58
You don’t see why Bitcoin is secure? I need to make sure I read that correctly before I go on a rant.

I bought a Ledger and put my BTC on it (after testing a tiny amount and a restore of course) and wrote down my 24 words. I've ordered a second Ledger that will be stored in a different location, but they're on back-order until the end of March. In the meantime I want to create an encrypted live USB with the secret key. How can I generate my secret key with the 24 words, or is there a Linux wallet that will allow me to import my key by filling in the words?
