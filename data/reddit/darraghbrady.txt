So I just checked and Canada’s national debt is projected to be $1.4 trillion. And US debt is going to reach$21.48 trillion. 
Looks like the US has a bigger debt and less to show for it per person to me.

What a fucking scam. Float fake news from one hand and have the head say something else. That’s a 10% dip they manipulated, and exactly with the SEC needs to get it together and start putting some goddamn rules to crypto. By putting off ETFs, the US is risking losing their position as a global financial leader

Typical stupid Canadians? Well at least we’re closer to an ETF, 5 weeks away from cannabis legalization, we have universal healthcare, high quality public education, higher life expectancies, lower crime and prison rates and a leader who has earned respect on the world stage. So if you think Canadians are typically stupid and that you’re feeling superior, I really feel bad for how things have got on your side. Happy Monday my American neighbour! Still love you guys even though you’re being miserable twats about NAFTA ��

I agree with Philip. It’s pre-internet, pre-globalization thinking to suggest it would be unsellable. You can’t put the tooth gel back in the one-way only tube.
