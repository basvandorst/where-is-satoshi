I wish Digitally Imported did! 
@_date: 2014-09-30 16:52:03
Haven't got that far yet.

You could try [ebay](

Just emailed them using your slightly edited message!  Thanks

Wasn't the Bitcoin CEO arrested!  Have they appointed a new one yet? :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 20:26:43
I'm from the UK too, here are some British tech retailers that accept Bitcoin.

Love being in for a tip!

Bitgive Foundation -

Is this using MDM, which allow the installation of Enterprise apps?
Cool idea if so!
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:52:30
Now under $300
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:00:11
Cool, much better than using bittylicious over here in the UK. Instant purchase using debit card &amp; no need for wire transfers!  Yay!
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:30:19
sorry I should have been clearer, I linked my Santander debit card (Visa)

Thar she goes! 
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:02:51
Someone needs to page Gabe!
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:18:06
Does this mean we'll be able to buy games on Steam for bitcoin (digital goods part)?

Sure enough, turning off adblocker did the trick.  Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:36:31
Pretty clever system, once you know you've been banned from Reddit you'll likely go and create a new username etc..  but this way you'll just think everyone is ignoring you and carry on posting!
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:15:24
Don't worry, the magic internet money wizard will sort it out!
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:56:35
Basically it would take in the region of 51,314,400,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years to get a shot at producing the private key, and even then it's likely to be wrong!

True, but then we don't know how many characters are in his password.
@_date: 2015-01-18 14:15:50
I didn't know Bitcoin had a Mayor! ;)

Wow, collected within seconds.  I'm missing the one time tip link on changetip.com is this US only?

And in a while longer they'll be worth $8, can't argue with that math. :)
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:42:07
Cool thanks!  Of course he's going to win!
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:56:41

Ordered it with them, no issues!
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:04:35
With the way things are going, with all the adblocking etc, more and more sites will resort to paywalls when ad revenue drops.  It's then this kind of thing comes into it's own.  Phones will come with mining chips inbuilt into them which use the generated Bitcoin to buy things for the user.
So in the future when you read your favourite news site with it's paywall your phone will automatically send over a few satoshis as payment without you even knowing about it.
Or am I off the track with that train of thought?
@_date: 2015-11-04 17:38:48
Ah yea, Blockchain tokens!
@_date: 2015-10-29 21:52:02
I'm sure it will be full of this and datt

Another layer of security would be to use OpenDNS.

You should sell shin pads!
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:07:16
Couple of bits? :)

If you like you could add the 'Bitcoin Accepted Here' Sticker to the purchase options section.  :-)
