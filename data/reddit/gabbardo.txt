@_date: 2017-10-29 12:17:30
Sorry i do not defend pos... i am trying to say that this model where miners are strengh is permited by the source code of btc... it is weak... need to think in other maners to have this economic model where miners are not so important or strengh
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:16:32
September 15th NEO will anounce partnership with PBoC... to issue new CNY tether... 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:29:15
Think, that you have 1 M USD in BTC and  than take a loan of 1M USD... and BTC drop 50%.... so if you have 500k to put in balance ok... and if uou have 500k to put in back in loan, why dont you buy more btc ? Why take a loan....  ok?
And you need to compute all this plus interests
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:50:56
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:26:57
Core need to find a way in source code to stop this possibility... because code is the law.... 
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:30:15
So you are saying is that the solution is more simple... only convince users... go get! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:47:12
So, no need to worry about that
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:08:34

51% attack needs to change name to 51% majority... because if you have a “51%attack” you are the minority interested part
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:47:01
Change from PoW to PoS or other thing....
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:42:39
I understand you, but think like this: if exchanges want to change name to BTC, this Altcoin... and they have a lot of strengh to do... then this altcoin will have the name Bitcoin.... this is not a problem... and depending of the advertising in it... it will be most valuable then actual bitcoin... welcome to democracy, that is a dictatorship of majority... or perhaps who have more hashpower
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:08:01
You are leveraging your investment... it is good if BTC go up, but is terrible if go down... you will lose in double... 
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:12:21
The code is the law... and the code permit this act of miners...  it is sad but... it is valid.... if the community want other form of decentralization, they need to think in other maner that do not depend of miners..

@_date: 2018-02-18 20:54:45
What protocol?
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:58:49
And will continue to be a problem... block hve a very slow time processing... imagine when bitcoin equaly ethereum in number of transactions... will be like 3 hours in average to confirm or US$ 100.00 to get faster
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:36:52
