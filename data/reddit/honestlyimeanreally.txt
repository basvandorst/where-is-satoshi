"This is good for bitcoin because..." 
@_date: 2016-08-14 21:56:19
If bitcoin actually takes off, there won't be a need for an exchange ;) 
I'm just joking around :)
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:25:43
It's been doomed for years yet here we are :)

What happens when net neutrality finally dies and ISPs begin to block protocols at the top-level? 
Sure, I can tunnel protocols through other protocols or use a VPN etc. 
But the average joe will abandon it, businesses will abandon it, and the fiat-values will tank. 
I say this as a huge supporter of crypto too... but to think it is unstoppable, in the United States, is being willfully ignorant.

What club is this? 
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:04:47
right? lawyer pointed out the easiest way to get another ~5k at current prices! 
@_date: 2014-12-27 17:04:13
What's the point of including all these id scanners and palm readers anyways? Bitcoin was founded on a core principle of very little regulation... 
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:40:56
True, but they let you use leverage which waters down their volume stats imo. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 21:44:58
Just like the internet in the good ol’ days 
Pain in the ass to use and not much to do, cumbersome et al. 
I’m just happy I can buy BTC for 4-figures. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:37:30
Couldn't a "smart" scammer just use a different isolated wallet to attack and foil that? Or am I not understanding this safeguard 
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:04:20
Thanks for taking the time to explain that to me!!! 
I give u reddit bronze (image unavailable)

Can someone eli5? Maybe ELI15? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:42:18
Definitely. My post isn't discussing the costs versus traditional banking...
Just throwing this out there for people who use bitcoin-qt's default fee algorithm, as that is currently not cutting it. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 14:05:42
I guess, the difference is a blockchain wouldn't require any interaction with the school as it's public. You just say "hey I graduated from X school, my diploma ID is Y, check the diploma blockchain to confirm!"
A simple database can be corrupted, and is centralized, and most likely will require more human management. That's the main difference, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:15:20
Blockchain verifying diplomas would completely eliminate counterfeit diplomas if done correctly, no? 
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:51:19
How do you short BTC? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:42:37
So.... What exchange do you short BTC with? 
Because you need to trade on margin, as far as I understand. 
Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-01-05 19:14:20
What are you talking about? 
Bartering absolutely exists!
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:49:33
Yeah I need to understand more such as RBF, sorry I misunderstood all this 
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:34:11
I am familiar with margin trading but you need an exchange to do it on, yes? 
Where do you short BTC is probably a better question...?
@_date: 2016-01-15 20:50:44
I wish my client did that by default, next time I will do the math myself. 
Lesson learned.
@_date: 2016-06-16 04:37:06
I would also like to see the original... Lol
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:37:29
Because they have a large majority say in what direction the protocol goes. 
A majority say isn’t decentralized by definition, and it’s the reason we have BCH in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:40:18
Number of contributors is not correlated with influence, though. If 495 people commit spelling mistake updates and 5 people are working on the core, who is more influential? 
Obviously this is hyperbole but the sentiment is absolutely the same. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 01:15:57


By every previous transaction. See other comments I’ve made. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 03:38:24
Does it matter? Cat is out of the bag. Just have to find it. 
@_date: 2016-11-20 16:01:10
1) most of them don't need to
2) see the winklevoss twins; they took their settlement from Facebook and made a Bitcoin-tied index fund.

Yeah, I don’t own either BTC nor BCH and Bitmain is worse than Blockstream for sure. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 14:53:07
I wonder how fast their populace will adapt to the air quality :-/ 
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:10:17
If you borrow my BTC and use them on an illicit service and then give it back, I am now potentially on the hook for your crimes. There are cases of people getting in trouble because of how they sourced coins. 
Furthermore, people pay a premium for uncirculated coins: why would they do this if BTC is 100% fungible? Because it’s not truly fungible........
Simply google “tainted bitcoins seized” please. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:41:12
I’m not worried about either BTC or BCH at the end of the day as I only hold Monero. 
The objectively closest project to gold that exists in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:56:36
Inverse the general Reddit sentiment for great results*
*results may vary*
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:45:37
I view it more as, it’s unrealized until you actually make the exchange. 
How can you say your profits are realized if the price could crash any minute? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:58:04
Welcome to cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:24:44
Uh, yeah, I explained that. 
You don’t *have any profit* until it’s sold. 
If you’re talking about shifting the paradigm from “profits in USD” to “profits in terms of value”, you’re seeking to change society as a whole. Works in theory; wont happen anytime soon. 
So what is it you’re actually asking? This is intriguing but I feel I am misunderstanding. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:27:40
Even if you didn’t plan on paying taxes, I would say profits are unrealized until the asset in question is sold. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:58:02
Everyone’s getting into it for returns and not for its intended use. 
This alone is the canary in the coal mine. Keep it simple. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:29:44
Haha, I value BTC. Trust me. 
But I can’t pay taxes, rent, or groceries in BTC (yet)
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:07:16
You don’t know what fungibility is. 
Google “tainted bitcoins seized” — this *cannot* happen with Monero because there is no way to track its history, unlike bitcoin.
Furthermore, why do people pay up to a 10% premium for uncirculated bitcoin? Oh right, because it’s not fungible. 
The fact that “tainted” bitcoins are worth less and uncirculated bitcoins are worth more objectively proves that BTC is not truly fungible; there is no debate around this, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:33:34


Please elaborate on this; I disagree because what really matters is how the fork will perform in years to come. This is the nature of open source software. 
Nobody will give a fuck about my Bitcoin Copper fork in a week, even though it’s out there. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:54:40


Is it? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:27:11


I would say a fully functioning 100bln market-cap decentralized payment platform is useful.
What other conventional service do we have that fills this gap? Western Union? Yeah, talk about ridiculous fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:57:01
Thank god. And thank you for the TL;DR
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:39:31
Right, and I’m sure neither has any influence on each other... wait no, that’s not how any of this works 
@_date: 2017-10-21 05:44:12


Please explain why a *literal Ponzi scheme* is in the top 10? (Bitconnect) 
Yes yes, the early investors will get paid. But *logically* the market should realize it’s a Ponzi scheme, according to you, no? 
Old saying on margin trading: “The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent”
I can go on...
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:03:04
Yes, bitcoin gold was quite transparently a money-grab on behalf of the developers, but to say it’s just injecting new money into the crypto sphere isn’t genuine either. 
All those people dumping have willing buyers on the end. They are the ones who will lose, not crypto as a whole. So yes, the initial release may add value, but honestly within hours, days, at most, the true value is found by the market. Just look at BTCG futures before they launched. $4-500/pop because ignorant greedy bastards have FOMO. Now? It’s barely $147. And that’s on an uptrend. 
You have to understand that almost every other coin is bought with bitcoin.
Surprise surprise, financial assets that aren’t subject to regulation or scrutiny are more volatile and exposed to market forces. This is simultaneously the value and weakness of crypto, but I can assure you that BTCG’s marketcap will continue to shrink as money moves back into legitimate coins. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 22:30:21
So don’t broadcast anything on a shit-chain and you’re fine? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:36:50
Sorry my comparison wasn’t up to your par — the point is, given the word set and number of words, it would take less time to count every grain of sand and every star than brute forcing a valid private key. 
Do you understand now? 
I’ll simply send you a link with someone smarter and more articulate than I explaining this, if you’re still confused. But part of me thinks you were just being pedantic. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:38:29
Yes, that is what I’m trying to say.
I didn’t know it was that unclear.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:04:44


You do realize I was using your own words against you, right? Look at the very first sentence of your comment that I originally replied to, where you say “logic exists in all markets.” 
So, which is it? You seem to be caught up in pedantically distinguishing what a market is. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:41:00
No thanks, you’re already contradicting yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:39:17
On the new fork only, correct? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:28:56
Deterministic mnemonic devices with more entropy than grains of sand combined with every star in the galaxy says otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:34:47
Wouldn’t it be nice to fully control your money? Be immune to bank freezes? Not be bound by 9am-4pm banking hours? Take it to any other country with Internet simply by memorizing a string of words? 
It’s the freedom and the features, simple as that.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:31:02
And instead of attempting to further educate me, you laugh at me. 
Is this how you sway opinions? Or rather, how you feel better about yourself? 
@_date: 2015-11-03 19:21:23
Still not perfect. 
Give me your private keys and I'll show you why :P 
@_date: 2015-11-05 07:00:10
If you're worried about regulation, remember, it's trivial to fork bitcoin into &lt;anything&gt;coin; I'm sure more privacy oriented coins will be implemented in the future. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:16:52
Oh so the protocol is clogged to put it simply? 
Interesting. Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 21:29:38
Why not both? :p
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:36:37
True 
@_date: 2015-11-05 07:23:39
Are you being harassed? 
Also, you say you're a trader, so therefore you buy/sell bitcoins: what's wrong with LBC? 
It's more discreet and I don't think they do anything like coinbase in regard to shutting down accounts who deal with people who then choose to spend money on the black market.
That part does really bother me: if my brother gives me $20 to buy gas and I buy drugs, the police aren't concerned with my brother. Why isn't it the same for bitcoin? Ugh. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:27:33
How many blockchains per bitcoin? 
Do blockchain transactions register on the Bitblock? 
Blockbitchain coin block socks and fox and rocks and cocks!
EDIT: SELL SELL SELL 
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:46:13
Why aren't any transactions being confirmed?

It's just bad for the traders and "riders"; it's fantastic for bitcoin.
Ideal currency isn't volatile. 
(Although some would say bitcoin isn't a true currency, it's a commodity; that's a whole different debate...)
