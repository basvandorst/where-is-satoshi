Yeah but the alternative is everyone has to have a 1Tb hard drive to support bigger blocks do everything on-chain. That would be madness that leads to centralization. There's no way people could walk around with 1Tb hard drives in their pocket in 5 years from now. Bigger blocks just don't scale. Also you can't use p2p networks to share files, it's just too inefficient and has never been done before.
I'd rather pay huge fees and give all my money to a distributed network of banks thx.

Put it this way, if they are false-signalling they stand to make a ton of money. If they are not, they are not. We will see in the next few days.

I'm not doing it - I recently stopped receiving my PhD stipend so if I don't trade I don't eat. But I appreciate the risk in doing so. I'm mainly trading BCH, so tbh Kraken going under is the least of my worries :P

That's a nice idea, but it doesn't work that way. You can only bundle transactions too/from the same accounts. If 1000 unique bitcoin wallets are used in your shop in a single day, then that's 1000 unique transactions that need to be written to the blockchain and there's nothing LN can do to prevent that. Now if an individual pays the same company 3x or 4x, then those transactions can be bundled, but you can't wait too long else the customer might spend their bitcoin elsewhere before you cash in. The LN network solves this by requiring customers to deposit $X into a shared multisig account that both parties have access to, and both parties must sign payments across. Then lots of little transactions between customer and buisness can be made, and the user can't double-spend because they have essentially already spent.
So the buisness model for LN is you go to a supermarket, load up $1000 into your super market account, and then you can make lots of little transactions to the supermarket from your $1000 supermarket account, and both parties can "cash out" at any time into the real blockchain.
So it does some consolidation but it isn't really useful until significant amounts of redundant transactions are on it. What's worse, the future for bitcoin involves people using a unique bitcoin wallet for every transaction for privacy, else supermarket.com will know you spent $65 at othersupermarket.com and might try to use that information to manipulate you. tl;dr the LN doesn't work in practice but it's a nice idea.

They don't. It's a myth to justify slow transaction times and high fees.
