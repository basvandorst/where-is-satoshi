But i think its unfair that we have to pay taxes if we buy something with bitcoin online.
Its like:
- I convert cash from USD to RUB
- Then price/value of RUB raises 20%
- I spend RUB to buy some dildos
- I have to pay taxes when i buy the dildos becouse muy RUB are now worth more than they were before, so i made capital gains.
This would be stupid. Now Just replace the Russian RUB with Bitcoin BTC and think why would that be any different.

Sending money to a different country.

@_date: 2017-12-03 17:02:58
you don't have to.
that is only if you want to sell those new coins. 
i still haven't even touched any of my forked coins yet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:04:47
Yes you are safe with Binance. Im 99% sure you will get the forked coins without any issues

@_date: 2018-06-13 11:34:40
india is the best
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:34:26


that is the whole point.
Chink has a large ammount of dirty money in bitcoins.
They print those receipts of purchases that never happened.
Then they can "justify" where they got all that bitcoin from
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:03:29

Do i have to register an account and pass a verification (submitting passport pictures etc) to GDAX?
And if yes, How long does it take to get verified? Do i have enought time before the fork happens?

Bart analysis shows that bitcoin will reach 6200-6600 in this pump
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:53:30
i mean i already have bitcoin and i want to send them to an exchange (like GDAX for example) to receive segwit2x and protect myself from the "no replay"-thing.
