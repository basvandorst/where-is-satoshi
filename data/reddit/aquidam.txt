Let's say I plan to wait for the situation to clarify...
My understanding (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that there's a chance B2X could became the 'new' BTC (the dominant crypto) - however I probably don't have a good grasp of how small/big of a chance it is.
So, with that in mind, one thing I know is that personally I'll probably be very reluctant to make any transaction after the fork for quite some time.
All of that being said, I guess that the answer to "what should I do"' depends on my own 'analysis' (read: belief) of the situation ?
If you have the time and patience, please bear with me and give me your thoughts :
- If I think there's a good (enough) chance B2X could become dominant, I must buy before the fork, in order to secure my assets into both ledgers. And ASAP, as the price will rise until the fork because of the people thinking alike, and those converting their altcoins into BTC for the same purpose.
- Same thing if I think both will coexist, at least for a while.
- If I'm ready to bet with confidence on which coin will stay/become the dominant one - which is not the case for me at the moment - I should wait for the fork to happen and then use the price drop that will happen when people will start to convert their BTC back into one or another altcoin.
As a side note [ and personal reminder, I guess :) ]:  Finally and more importantly, I think I should remember that, in any case, I should relax, as no one have a definitive answer on this, and wisely evaluate how much I am able to *lose* and thus only play with that amount of money...
Does it make sense or am I utterly wrong somewhere ?
