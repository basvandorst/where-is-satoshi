Looks to me that wallet belongs to someone else, and they released their gains..
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:17:15
all I know is you can't retrieve them, because you made the mistake that there's a disclaimer on, was the tx for the same amount you mistakingly sent?  
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:36:05
No good deed goes unpunished, just be sure who you're giving to isn't being greedy like some of the 'top' charities about rn

You're saying you sent btc to bch wallet and it went through? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:00:39
the MOST prevalent thing I've seen in this space is that you MUST check address you're sending to before you send coins, and that what you've done, is effectively burned coins, which means they are gone, and can not be retrieved.  hope you learned your lesson

That’s really cool of them, they’re MJB 2013 Commemorative rounds about $10 they’re copper plated in gold, they’re the last available apart from the regular copper rounds.  Silver just sold out recently along with the “antique” silver rounds.

they didn't want that shit it wasn't actually worth 35k lolol, should have sold into bitcoin

Why I use exodus instead

He's talking about us bitcoin users, because he's in a different crypto market with one coin that isn't tied to btc, obviously
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:42:08
Ehhhhh I mean this point isnt helping your case, Julian Assange's manhunt had more energy put into than bin laden and you're gonna say that's where we leave it?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:09:27
A handful of exchanges like binance said like a block or two before the fork, that they were going to list btg, four hours later I sold all of my btg at 500, Just sadly didn't buy back in at 140 where it sat for days 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:02:10
If it weren't for most of us making these shitty decisions, there'd be no one to be on the short end of the stick when it's your turn to make a good trade lol

Get wallet from any site that gives you public and private key, print the pdf, book ur wallets on paper. Googling your public key allows you to view ALL transactions associated with the address, having the private key (public not needed) gives you access to those funds.  Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:46:43
The paper wallet is just so you can access your wallet ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, ALL funds are on the blockchain, it's just a matter of if YOU have the private keys, (on paper or word document) or you let a third party hold them for you (exchanges and in a way hard wallets)
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:29:35
There's so much other foul play when it comes to Ver that lumping up all "legal" criminals together just because they have a record to pin one guy just makes everyone else look bad when not everyone is
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:05:05
Trezor is a third party, I only trust myself to hold my keys just a personal thing 
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:38:14
nice hash honestly isn't worth it unless you have significant hash power, if you want to mine just use claymore or cc miner depending on green or red team (nvidia or amd) and learn to setup a batch file for miners
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:24:58
This needs to be pinned, this needs to end 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:10:15
I just don't feel that using what he's legally characterized as isn't a good main point 
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:08:44
lol three months ago if you said in November there'd be a price crash to 7000 I'd laugh 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:34:49
Coinmarketcap price is an average of volume and price on all available exchanges, dope website really, to be honest before it started I'm sure that while volume was WAY lower, it was still probably much more of a wild west guessing game to buy and sell coins at a good rate, devs definitely deserve every Satoshi they're donated 
@_date: 2017-11-06 10:02:27
lmao binance announces a yoyow trading competition that just doubled my position in it so I laughed at play altcoins

2027 is a conservative estimate
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:34:32
Using a hardware wallet is a scam, just use something like exodus that's a window to the blockchain so your funds are always safe there, not in an exchange or something (if you have the private key to your funds you can retrieve them even if exodus goes down or your PC fails
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:36:30

@_date: 2017-11-02 03:29:45
I'm underexplaining, obv a reputable wallet, I've just always liked exodus as it's very similar to MEW in the sense that you can access your wallets from the phrase, but you can also have them via export private key

Is it too late to sell out of all alts, doing so I'd be at a great loss, but does anyone here think they'll go down 95%?

While you can trade fiat like USD and KRW into alts like LTC and ETH, they're only really measured by their btc price (majority volume for every alt coin), and converting that through the average of btc global trading price. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:36:21
Btc is our standard measuring the value of a coin/token(built on another coins blockchain, e.g. eth and erc20s) and multiplied by its circulating suppy, finding its *market cap*.  It is used as a medium for a majority of miners to sell their profits, or to value their earnings per day by converting through its trading price in btc.

if you don't mine, then maybe

Forcing it is how you get overvalued, just let it happen, you're clearly impatient.  It's inevitable for the world to adopt it.
