I think he is alive and have keys. He will probably sell them when bitcoin hit $100k+.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:06:05
Yeah, whales are celebrating.
@_date: 2018-01-04 09:17:43
Yes exactly. And no, I don't see correlation between time and chance that keys are lost.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:04:41
Patient my friend. There will be plenty of time in the future to buy it for that price you sold.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:25:55

Thanks segwit!
@_date: 2017-08-06 12:20:45
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:26:14
Yea, what is this fee?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:57:35
Yeah, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:01:56
1 Million in tethers LOL
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:33:28
Take profit.
Until it's too late...
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:20:22
Ok, thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:09:46
Depends on how long tether will survive.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:04:23
But, but it's not dollars. It's tethers...
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:49:43
Did you take profit?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:27:05
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:00:59
See you soon. Bitcoin will cost $500 again.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:07:51
Don't listen to this WHALE guys.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:57:16
Do you wanna pop the bubble?
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:29:04
Don't short bubble...
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:00:33
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:54:04
Did you take profit or still holding BTC?
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:08:34
Aaaaaaaaaaand it's gone.
@_date: 2018-02-11 08:08:00
Dump to 0 tethers.
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:26:18
Not true
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:11:34
Bitcoin is not a bubble! /s
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:01:07
I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:43:28
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:51:37
Come on... shh
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:21:55
Of course it's Ponzi, lol.
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:59:20
Why you so mad?
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:08:28
Soon... When the price drops...
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:03:01
Yes it's part of a bubble. Be careful guys.
@_date: 2017-10-30 09:32:06
Yeah, true. So there even less people who controls the big stake of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:13:26
Answer is easy - fake tethers.
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:42:24
I don't get you. Are you trolling?
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:20:45


It could only lower the number of people owning these wallets, not increase. When creating new address there is no new people born for this address on the planet.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:10:24
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:32:33
Terrible time to enter... Be careful price could drop hard.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:40:20
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:41:43
It couldn't happen. It was the last pump, look price next month.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:49:39
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:55:53
You are not rich if you didn't fix profit.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:06:09
Feel bad for you.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:05:59
!remindme 1 year
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:16:49
Did you mean Tether?
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:23:11
You have no rights there, did you read ToS?
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:07:49
Name one.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:10:40
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:05:55
But they do not signal for segwit bit. 20000010 - doesn't mean they will fork off chain?
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:35:19
@_date: 2017-07-17 15:27:45
I want to see this statistic too

9 btc? huh
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:52:31
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:16:07
How much there total?

@_date: 2017-07-01 09:42:26
Meh, who cares. If some pools don't want to mine bitcoin who cares? They willl lose a lot of money mining their altcoin or will start mine bitcoin if they don't want to lose money.
Simple /thread.

What does fork mean? Isn't it just altcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:43:09
So, there will be hardfork?
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:33:27
People change.

@_date: 2017-07-18 11:27:15
I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:05:37
Wait till chain split. Price will be like $400.

@_date: 2017-07-16 09:06:33
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:50:42

They don't pay fees, they earn them.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:51:39
No, miners do not want big blocks...
@_date: 2017-07-09 19:33:36
You won't.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:00:17
That's true.
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:28:55
RIP bear.
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:14:11
Good idea
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:15:55
I think miners need to make a right decision and move on from pools that support Segwit2x. Pools without miners (users) are nothing.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:48:17
Signaling Segwit2x or NYA? Can you please use right words?
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:34:25
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:39:03
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:42:22
Yeah, waiting bitcoin at $200 here.
@_date: 2017-06-30 09:16:09
Yep, simple like this. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:35:48
Without "m" is fine too.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:40:07
Because Satoshi gone?
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:41:47
Buy high sell low.
@_date: 2017-06-29 19:09:33
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:12:13
$5k easy this month.
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:58:43
Who said? Pools != Miners
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:41:25
Yes, I'm talking about NYA BS.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:59:19
That's centralized BS. Just signal segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:23:49
Difficulty willl change and everything will be fine.
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:58:35
tell me date when one bitcoin worth $1?
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:40:18
Not gonna happen. Not this time not later.
And yeah, miners do NOT want big blocks.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:50:47
PSA: It's photoshoped image! Down vote.
Real image 
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:41:47
Even more: does Segwit2x has BIP?
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:29:12
Yeah, totally agree. Looks like big pools dig a hole to themself. Time to change leaders.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:56:39
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:28:53
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:59:26
Yeah, I agree. But I understand why they over-reaction, because price will drop to the floor if this happens. But after year or half it will go up some. And you can't really compare ETH with Bitcoin. ETH is already altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-22 22:46:31
Yes, they do.
