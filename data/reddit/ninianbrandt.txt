Banks have many more than the one use case. This is a pretty good thumbnail sketch.

I'm seriously trying hard to map the answer to this question in my mind. Maybe nothing, especially for the average human like me.  But when you get to where you care about the velocity of your money, that is, what it can achieve for you in a finite span of time, then the inertia of banks might have a benefit. Still fuzzy, but I want to make this like algebra in my head.

I'm working on a self-contained gap fillng super contract to  liberate from the "dumb courts."  It's a big project, making concepts into algebra.

I imagine a billion dollar construction project. But some are probably doing it like you think. :)

A programmer recommended this book to me (novice programmer lawyer) as a way to imagine how to build good solutions on top of sound core technology. It comes from an architecture perspective, so it might help you envision.

But if I say "hey, you guys need to look up from a bigger perspective" I'm a shill. Which I'm not. I'm just a girl. Or at least I used to be.

I've been thinking of meat as a use case. Thanks for the link.

I imagine a different scenario:  Banks spend a billion or more dollars on blockchain data infrastructure to work the kinks out. Then they deploy an internal cryptocurrency model for intra-bankblockchain settlement. After the next large governmental currency crisis, their model gains traction because it is potentially less susceptible to things like US Congress voting to increase spending limits or other political interference. What this admittedly imaginary scenario would mean for non-bank cryptocurrencies gnaws at me.

You shamed me into a more forthright post. 
Thanks. :)

Thanks!  I applied. I may not be fair harvard's cup o tea, tho.

I think you nailed it. Add an intermediate step where they settle bank2bank transactions in a "bankcoin."  They are planning far ahead. Bank for International Settlements:  
@_date: 2015-12-17 11:06:15
I think they have to start with a bank-to-bank settlement coin but it's part of long-range planning.

This is a well written article that gives an overview of what it means to be able to execute relationships/transactions over an immutable data stream. I see use cases everywhere I go.

They have listened without believing, which is fine, I don't want anyone to believe in me, just in legally demonstrable facts.  I've been talking to lawyers about it and many can't escape the mental box they put bitcoin into -a cognitive burden of proof. However, as my small predictions are coming true in the workplace in ways that are relevant to practice, the "ahas" are starting. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:22:30
They are building and building. But what will we need regardless of how all this high-level stuff plays out?  That is what I am working on.

I think we're seeing  a further decoupling of the private law and the public law processes. Private law will race to keep up because it helps businesses make money in new spaces. In private law, the motivation will be to make tools to minimize consumption of resources and improve predictability without creating liability. Public law is a different issue.

Those nuts and bolts questions are what I am working on. Smart contracts are infants today but they will be very powerful in the future.

As a middling janitor of capitalism, I absolutely see how blockchain technology in very limited form can replace many of my functions, so long as I can prove immutability of data, provide chain of data custody and apply mathematical functions to the data. With or without coins, there are non-glamorous solutions waiting to cascade. 
How far the tech can go to replace me probably depends on the universality of the system and whether it adopts  value tokens. Decoupling is all well and good, but add coins into the tech and it is limited only by degree of consensus. We should wildly imagine outcomes of a singular, planet-wide asset machine to identify outcomes we want to avoid - without getting too tinfoil hatty about believing the predictions. It's about being aware and alert to known patterns.

Especially bitcoin unicorns heavily leveraged in government fiat. They are the most vulnerable ones, and the likely mechanism by which large chunks of blockchain real estate, tokens, data, processes and all get transferred to bank possession. Easy peasy. I don't know how the humans go without the other money yet, so I'm not blaming.  Just seeing a pattern.

No. It was too busy, but I'll see him again. He's part of the group who CAN change his mind, and it's a bit disappointing. I told him "read the article."

As opposed to the abuse-free system we have? They should to imagine having a bigger brain to work with but alas, they are in Flatland.
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:29:12
I knew my comment underestimated them for sure. I just think everyone should read Flatland. :)

You all knew this was coming. What next? A settlement coin for inter-bank transactions. If it proves less volatile than national currency during the next financial crisis, how might "bankcoin" affect bitcoin and national currencies? 
@_date: 2016-01-01 14:06:09
It's all of the above - it is what people do with it.
@_date: 2016-01-11 18:27:52
The point about enforceability Odom makes is only partially true.  The government might have limited power to compel you to produce or transfer a coin. However, if it has jurisdiction over you or your stuff, its power is not limited to the coin asset. Courts can satisfy a judgment with other assets. Failure to make a court-ordered transfer might be contempt punishable by jail time, just like it is with nonpayment of other ordered amounts. It doesn't work to stand in a human body in a place on the planet and say those laws don't apply.  
That said, he's right about being able to use smart contracts to wrest control of many private matters back into private hands.  But it's neither simple nor absolute.

I love BTC, but he's got a point because of his ability to make his prediction come true.  He is part of a group that can create a "shock doctrine" event in the leveraged-in-dollars bitcoin unicorn startup community.  Dotcombubble.2 bursts and they consolidate bitcoin assets amongst establishment players who have recently gone all-in on blockchain tech. We start a new alt-currency model, they follow the innovation, lather, rinse, repeat.  History repeats, is what Jamie Dimon is saying.

Crucible of potential, not progress. Sure, but I guess you haven't been on the ground here. It's actually the front line of the culture war, which is what has "them" so freaked out. If I were still in school I would write a thesis on Brexit, the NC legislature's use of sex fear and referenda as manipulative tools, the Federalist Papers and how we make something better than this with technology. But instead I will just work on building it.

I live in NC. There is a ton of investment in crypto going on here because we are a crucible of potential for making great things with blockchain technology. However, in order to make sure that the big players invest in the state, they are going to protect the big players from disintermediation from a homegrown startup disruptor. Net worth and bonding requirements.

In order to make an existing model obsolete, one should have a deep understanding of how existing reality works, otherwise one risks failing to anticipate the way the model will play out in real life.  
@_date: 2016-07-07 13:53:55
I didn't use that word. Potential for blockchain based business is huge here. Do we have a bunch of yahoos making regressive decisions based on ignorance and control of citizen thought in our legislature? Yep. That is a whole different post. :)

What good would that do them? The prize is the next level up- the world computer. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 12:51:22
Have you considered this issue from the banks' perspective? Banks want more than to make a settlement ledger or to "compete" with bitcoin.  They see financial services disintermediation coming, so they are playing a longer, broader game. 
If you were head of a gigantic bank, what would you do in order to come out on top?
