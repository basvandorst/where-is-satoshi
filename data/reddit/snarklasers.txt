Yay, twas fun!
@_date: 2015-05-06 12:50:45
Thanks, someone had to say it. Too much kool-aid drinking going on here.

block 7: handsomechandler sent snarklasers $0.5
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:17:24
Everything looks awesome, seriously. You guys are hiring as well! - you should make another post in this sub about that, lots of interested applicants here.
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:55:30
Is there a way to send transactions with fee lower than 100 bits in Electrum?
@_date: 2015-04-12 06:45:31
Because whoever sells you the bitcoins might be prosecuted under bullshit laundering charges etc. (if you misuse the bitcoins).
If you've been around here long enough, you must've read the CoinBase hate threads. That US exchange attempts to heavily comply with money transmitter regulations (upto and including snooping on its customer's transactions).
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:24:32
Do you have a screenshot of your original post?
@_date: 2015-04-03 08:14:22
Anyone else having weird conversion rate problems with ShapeShift? They say they charge no fees but I never receive the correct converted amount.
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:11:15
As a first time visitor to the site, I am a little confused. Say I load up $10 and make a purchase of $5, do the remaining $5 stay in my account or are they returned instantly? If so, do I need twitter to sign up?
There is also a field to enter your email - does that mean non signed up users can use the site?
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:24:39
No, I think anon accounts is a good idea. Since there's an instant refund users shouldn't really have any problems.
My next coffee is on you, thanks. :)
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:58:29
You're right, but there's more to it. I think when most people get up in the morning and check this sub, they are expecting some big news to break. But true good news rarely comes in. This breeds frustration; a "why-aren't-we-at-moon-already" kind of sentiment that ends with rubbish posts like this.
Reddit as a whole is pretty good at calling bullshit, which is why the mum dissenting voices ITT make me fear for this sub.
@_date: 2015-04-21 09:42:41
Didn't know you could actually donate from the site. This is very cool and a significant addition to LightHouse.
@_date: 2015-04-13 17:54:19
What's more interesting/sad is how this post is on the frontpage.
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:41:24
It isn't. Check out @_date: 2015-04-17 07:22:54
No, the problem is that this sub sees reasonable people* as trolls.
* No, the price won't explode to $10,000+ tomorrow for no reason.
* No, there is no reason to believe Bitcoin will be the world's next reserve currency. It's too easy for governments to create their own coins.
* No, Bitcoin is not like the Internet. The Internet had no competitors; whereas, long before Bitcoin, I could send money form A to B on the Internet.
@_date: 2015-04-20 07:06:14

@_date: 2015-04-12 10:26:46
I see. But there's another problem: this sub is full of people who are against NSA spying. Facebook doesn't fit in exactly.
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:02:11
It is sooo hard to make a fake Facebook profile, isn't it kiisfm?
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:03:56
Seriously, is no one, no one, not a single goddamn person worried (for bitcoin and this sub's future) that tosh like this is making it to the frontpage?
@_date: 2015-03-07 07:38:10


This. Good luck getting people here to understand how alien CCs still are to normal people.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:57:08
Did they take this post down? Because the entire forum  is inaccessible ATM.
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:52:30
Circle needs to provide clarity about which countries they offer their services in. I bet anyone to go to their website and pull up the list of supported countries. Impossible without a Google search.
@_date: 2015-03-16 11:55:41
I only recently realized that Electrum is a privacy nightmare. I am considering switching to the core client.
My question is - every time I send a transaction on core, am I not associating my addresses with my IP to the node(s) that pickup the transaction? The problem might not be anywhere as bad as with a light client, but it is a problem amirite?
As a core client user, in what other ways can my pseudo-anonymity be compromised?
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:03:51
The unfortunate thing is that Electrum is a great piece of software. Powerful and stable. I fell in love with the retro UI almost instantly.
Didn't know BCI had a service for that. I will look into Armory.
I have been thinking that a quick fix would be for the guys behind Electrum to run their own official server. I would be sort of comfortable trusting them. There are already servers like "electrum.no-ip.org" that claim no logging is done.
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:13:59
You are right ofc. I donated to WikiLeaks; something these middlemen wouldn't allow me to do, while sitting on a different corner of the planet, for a couple of cents of transaction fees.
Bitcoin *is* magic.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:59:31
They still think they can get away with it. Criminals.

Write to ~~Cryptsy~~ Shitsy again. Staff members do indeed have Reddit accounts, but no one will help you until you publicly shame them. (Your post is too soft to elicit a response.)
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:07:34
You don't mention a very crucial counterargument, which is that email was an extreme innovation. Like make-your-hair-stand-on-end kind of innovation.
Bitcoin is extremely innovative, make no mistake, but it is a second gen. innovation. The market is saturated with easy and quick ways to transfer money from one person to the other.
What I mean is that we are yet to see the 'killer' apps that will make bitcoin use indispensable. Until that happens, the comparison with email simply doesn't hold.
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:34:57
Not applicable. Cryptsy is also a USD exchange. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 07:42:10


You must be angry at the nonsensical comments, but please don't lose it peoplma. It will be much easier to bury your message.
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:37:31
The forum is flooded. People care. The Internet won't forgive.
@_date: 2015-03-26 10:05:36
You are an awesome mod. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-03-05 14:02:32
You either used email or didn't use email, no one was giving talks and writing blog posts to convince people to use it.
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:17:05
Thank God (and OP) I saw this. Goodbye, uTorrent.
@_date: 2015-03-07 07:46:41
Then why did you delete the post?
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:48:23

@_date: 2015-03-07 07:50:32
I can't see why? You might like to write to BashCo, he is an awesome mod.
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:16:06
I don't need Circle, I have plenty of local exchanges in my country and I'd rather support them.
Web wallet? I don't even use a mobile wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-05 16:33:17


Aww, yeah!
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:47:22
I just hope Reddit finds a way to make money by then.
@_date: 2015-03-16 12:31:49




Aww Yiss. I'll also set it up to use Tor as a proxy. Thanks for letting us know of your personal experience with using a static IP.
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:44:15
Andreas is with you. See his recent MIT talk.
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:21:21


For now, I'd trust TF over uTorrent.
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:53:11
Oh, you need to be very careful with regards to securing your coins. You need to read up on cold storage and bitcoin security.
I suggest you disconnect your Internet connection on the computer with bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-10 12:44:18
My thoughts exactly. Nothing much happened. Not to mention that each time we talk about the price, this sub cheapens a little.
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:04:31
Wow you're creating a different moniker for everyone. You're awesome, thanks!

Keeping your bitcoins on a computer **not** connected to the Internet.

Problem solved, thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:10:43
Ad? This has been long time coming. [Andreas is involved in it]( He has publicly said that Spurlock and his team were very receptive and he expects this to be mostly positive.
So free publicity from a major news channel? Just letting everyone know this is coming up, as I personally have been waiting for it a long time.
@_date: 2015-02-28 11:13:14
@_date: 2015-03-09 02:53:35
They even link to @_date: 2015-02-19 21:30:16
So if I log in without doing anything for 6 mins that should solve it? I'll try that, thanks.
