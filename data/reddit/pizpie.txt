This process will be made a lot easier with Plutus

Someone should re-cut this trailer and use Bitcoin every time they mention their mock currency.

This is their White Paper - 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:22:36
CME Sunday, TD, Monday.
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:14:28
"Plutus follows the philosophy of Bitcoin more closely by connecting you with traders directly. By using its built-in decentralized exchange, Plutus removes the need for middlemen,or relying on a third-party exchanges with varying levels of security and up-time. "
You can read more information about how Plutus works in our latest blog entry. 
Read it here - 
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:13:07
If you go to  you can be one of the first to start using Plutus when we make our alpha available to the public. We are looking at a early 2016 launch 
@_date: 2015-12-02 15:17:16
Not at this time, as Apple is still restricting 3'rd party developers access to their NFC API.
This is not to say that this will not change in the future, as at first the Touch ID fingerprint scanner (and API), which came out in 2013 was made available to developers in 2014 with the iOS8 update.
If and when Apple does open up their API to the public, we will revisit the topic.
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:11:25

It converts the bitcoin to fiat before it is sent to the TFL via a prepaid virtual debit card.
@_date: 2015-12-04 18:50:21
I agree. Plutus helps with that transition by allowing Bitcoin users to pay for their everyday transactions in a way that is familiar to them. Showing people that it is possible to use Bitcoin in their every day life is an important step in increasing the adoption of Bitcoin as an every day tool for payment.
@_date: 2015-12-04 21:21:09
When you send the bitcoin for conversion,  you will see your balance in your local currency and its value in bitcoin at the same time. Ideally we would have complete merchant adoption of bitcoin, but that is not the case at this time. A lot of merchants who do accept bitcoin, still cash back into fiat instantly. Plutus does this conversion before it reaches the merchant. This lets you use bitcoin to pay at any merchant by proxy, without the need to wait for merchant adoption, and the merchant is left happy with their local currency at the end of each transaction. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 06:14:34
Initially the app will support USD, GBP, EUR as local currency.
@_date: 2015-12-05 06:59:49
I believe those numbers will change in the next couple years. Everything about Bitcoin is trending up. Including user adoption. Apps like Plutus will help speed that up.
@_date: 2015-12-04 19:07:37
The conversion actually happens in 3 confirmations. Once a user sends Bitcoin to their Plutus account, the Bitcoin is automatically and instantly sold on the blockchain powered DEX platform. Traders buying your Bitcoin have the fiat in escrow so your virtual debit card is credited instantaneously. So in a real life situation you will send $20 worth of bitcoin in the morning and by the time you leave the house your mobile device is ready to simply tap and pay for you daily expenses.
@_date: 2015-12-02 14:50:12
You can become a founding member and get a invite to test alpha when its ready here: 
Public launch is early 2016
@_date: 2015-12-04 18:51:47
"There are few AML guidelines to comply with. Especially for traders buying your bitcoins, but for smaller spending limits, all you have to do is sign up."
More details about these guide lines will be made public soon. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 10:52:08
Initially the app will support USD, GBP, EUR as local currency. If you have selected to do the initial conversion in GBP and travel to the  U.S. to spend, then yes, you will pay fees to the global debit card network. However, we have tried to  give users an option to avoid that completely by allowing the initial conversion in three of the top currencies.
Because the app is only recommended for small expenses, you can deposit £10 worth of bitcoin to your GBP account and then $20 worth to USD account. The app will let you select which account to use for your daily use. The international conversion fee was already thought of,  and this is our solution to bypass those astronomical charges. By support the top 3 currencies, the user can bypass the global debit card network fees (2.5%).
@_date: 2015-12-04 17:43:26
We have not announced the fixed date, but early 2016.
If you go to  you can sign up to be a founding member and be the first to try Plutus when we release our public Alpha.
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:58:51
It will be released for just Android devices to begin with. Other OS's will follow periodically.
There will be no iOS release until Apple gives access to their NFC API.
@_date: 2015-12-05 10:18:22
Bitcoin offers its users monetary sovereignty, greater control over their own banking and access to more services. Plutus enables bitcoin users to easily transact with bitcoin in their every day lives.
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:14:10
It's a love they don't fully yet understand.

Leave it to a Canadian exchange to be the first ones to do something properly in crypto.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:54:13
We will be opening up phone lines soon.
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:11:03
You would then need the exchanges to facilitate the sale of whatever new thing they were mining, and then you would need a demand for that product. You basically have to start from scratch. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 22:41:35
If they use a tap and pay payment terminal, then they are NFC enabled. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:57:08

It means you will need to check your deposit address before making a transaction before depositing on 1Broker

I am receiving word that the issue has been fixed and transactions should begin processing shortly. Sorry for the inconvenience!

$75k isn't a substantial amount, so let's not panic for once on some exchange related news.

That's because it's a PR piece for Bitstamp.  
@_date: 2017-01-13 07:17:54
Let's hope they just put a fee on trading at  spot exchanges, and suddenly we will get a much more clear picture of how much market volume China really does have compared to other regions.
We may be surprised that it isn't as China dominated as people think.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:46:11
Because they control such a large portion of the mining.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:41:34
If there were a compromise, then withdraws would be disabled and impossible. 1broker has been operating since 2012 without any incidents or loss of user funds.

@_date: 2017-01-12 07:24:46
Too much. ��
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:57:29
Had similar thoughts. Obviously they are two different entities, but seeing the PBOC take action should defiantly be seen as a positive.
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:50:22
This is good for Bitcoin, not bad.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:58:49
0% fees - They can trade the same coins over and over between each other. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 08:17:45
Issue is known and being addressed by dev team. Updates in 
@_date: 2017-01-12 05:25:25
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:39:10
Down voted because people need to stop reading Zero Hedge and actually understand what an exchange with fees vs ones without means for their volume.
tl:dr = It inflates it.
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:18:36
The coins don't need to be fake. Their goal is to generate volume -
So if I can take 1000 BTC and quickly execute a trade into my own orders with no cost and no risk to me, why wouldn't I?
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:28:32
I would imagine so, yes.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:45:12
They already exist. The point is the can't exist onshore in China...
@_date: 2017-01-12 22:07:30
I did the same in 2013. Don't feel bad - You realized the potential. You need to have a 5-10 year outlook for your investment, not a 5-10 days.
@_date: 2016-06-26 22:39:33
Of course not - If a user makes a mistake, all they need to do is open a support request and the issue will be corrected and they will be credited with their deposit. This was mentioned [here](

News like this will take some time to be priced into the market. Overall and long term this is bullish for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:14:10
Which trickles down to the people in the end.

Strange - It's up for me (Using Chrome) - 
Oddly enough, they did not test Bitcoin and the Litecoin they tested was  V 0.10.2
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:59:44
I like their brand and their products and I wanted to purchase one. However, I wanted to also support Bitcoin so I use social media to raise awareness and show the company that there is interest from its customers for them to accept Bitcoin. 
If you get enough people together who want the same thing, the companies will take notice. They want to capitalize on trends as much as anyone.  Companies listen when you speak with your wallets.
@_date: 2017-01-12 17:30:53
TLDR: 
The report said they chose "25 representative blockchain software"
Blue is "medium risk vulnerability" and red is "high risk vulnerability"
@_date: 2017-01-14 18:49:21
We could soon find out if PBOC restrictions are expanded.
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:38:26
It's only a loss if you sell lower than you bought.

Of course the market is manipulated. However, as the market grows, it becomes more difficult to maintain control - You need more and more capital to maintain control.

They can still gamble. Just on lower leverage - Or move to another exchange, or trade a different product. ;)

@_date: 2017-04-30 21:29:54
I point you to my tweet here: 
I believe Bitcoin matches up with an exponential curve pretty well, so I predict that we continue to see a ramp of liquidity in all crypto markets as more users, investors + money enter the market.
When you take into account the industries that Bitcoin / blockchain tech is set to disrupt and look at those market caps, you realize that the upside is massive.
