Hi, I created addon for Firefox and Chrome for crypto prices on Binance. Pairs with BTC, ETC, BNB and USD calculated from BTC.
I would be happy if you people would give it a try :)

If you also invested in other crypto, try this add-on for Firefox -&gt;  
One click button, which shows actual prices of cryptos on Binance in pop-up window, no need to go to sites. :)

Yup, I know I know, but I said to myself to just wait till Monday morning, just to be sure it doesn't dip.

So if I want to get into it, I shouldn't wait for some dip and invest right now?

I wanted to buy it for 20$ to test it, didn't have them on PayPal , so I at least picked 2$ through some sites, now I looked and got 34$, and invested few more bucks into it, it's never too late.
