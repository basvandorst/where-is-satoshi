Didnt know that. I dont have bitcoin or any crypto. Too volitile for my taste and too new as investment to toss money at it. Id rather buy golden and silver age comics to invest in.

you do realize the everyday joe on the street doesnt want to have to think in terms of value in tens hundreds thousands millionths places. which is why bitcoin will never be fully adopted by the masses. how you all cant see that defies reason.

All you have done is repeat yourself. People are not going to want to deal in a currency that doesnt deal in whole numbers. Avg people are not going to latch on that. Prove me wrong.

I sometimes think you proponents of bitcoin are woefully naive. 
Bitcoin has only been around since 2009 officially but you think it's is a sound investment tool like stock market,  commodities trading, bank CD's and the rest that have had upwards to 100 years of use?  That's what I mean by unproven. You don't really think nothing else will ever be developed to take bitcoin's place? The whole vc market is a baby compared to the rest. We don't know how it's will affect normal economies good or bad. 
Hell nothing I've ever read includes taxation of it. You think governments are just going he blythly allow a currency to undermine it's own economy? The technology is what will eventually become valuable. That's why people like Ms. masters is attempting to use the tech to incorporate it into current financial bodies.  
I think you all are so idealistic you are just naive. 
Think about it who the duck is going to try and use a currency where people have to think in hundreths or thousandths of a coin to price and pay for items since only a few rich people can afford a single bitcoin.  And on that how do you feel that 1000+ people control 40%+/- of the value of bitcoin? Talk about your 1% 
fees are going up, they system is slowing down for processing transactions and the devs and miners can't agree on how to change the system to accommodate all the new users. Let's not forget how many times money has been stolen by hackers.

but people will still take gold over a digital coin. hype has caused it to increase in value.

I wasn't specifically saying a pound of gold rather the majority of people out there given a choice will take gold over electronic 1's and 0's

how much of it is driven by ideas of getting rich or is it a general sense of diversifying risk?

I would expect government backed blockchains to become more widely accepted in the future than the others simply because their current familiarity with government back currency. A safer bet to say.
Does the FDIC protect any of your bitcoin in the event of another mt fox?
Bitcoin and the like are unproven in the realm of investment. And should be a red flag to any prudent inventor.

I remember the first time I delt with bofa. I was out of high school living in a new state. I had a 2000$ bank certified check to use in order to open a checking account. 
I was treated like a criminal. They couldn't believe a 19 year old could save that much money and it was a fraudulent check.
