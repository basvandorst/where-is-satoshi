Is is it easy to liquidate your bitcoin into cash?
@_date: 2016-04-27 23:01:15
And all you have to do, is trust them, with your banking information…it's kind of like PayPal, but for bitcoin...

Does it make sense, to pay for your lawn service, with a currency that is so volatile? You could accidentally end up grossly over-paying your gardener...

Just saw him on Charlie Rose…where he claimed that penicillin is effective against viruses...

The biggest problem I see with bitcoin, is converting it back into cash…everybody wants to sell me bitcoin, for cash, but there is no ATM, that you put bitcoin into, and get dollars back out...
@_date: 2014-06-08 03:22:49
Obviously…either way, there is potential for both you and the gardener to either land a windfall, or get a raw deal…if the rate fluctuates more than a few percent, *somebody* might get the feeling they're getting ripped off, and back out of the deal.

Does the bus take bitcoin?

You don't think that Bill Gates was allowed to become that wealthy, without a few strings attached, did you?

I suppose you could do it by Morse code, if you really had to...

Question: how easy is it, to sell bitcoin for cash?
@_date: 2016-11-10 17:46:20
A regular ATM doesn't accept Bitcoin, does it?
What Bitcoin needs, is an ATM where you can easily exchange Bitcoin, for cash, and buy Bitcoin *with* cash. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:54:16
How? ATM? Wire transfer? Western Union? 
Will the cash print out, on my printer?
Who keeps enough cash on hand, to pay me out, at $4k/coin?
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:19:22
What else would you use bitcoin for...buying groceries?
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:43:20
Where I live, even if I had a substantial bitcoin income, if I had to pay for my food with it, I would starve to death...
@_date: 2016-11-14 00:25:35
Nice...you would think that a guy like Thiel would be into that...
However...if you want to buy something really nice, like say, a mansion, or a private jet, the sellers don't usually take Bitcoin, and there is no easy way to cash out 30 mil, at one time...
@_date: 2016-11-09 20:19:24
It could be *good* for Bitcoin...
If dispensaries located Bitcoin ATMs in their stores, they could become the missing link, in the Bitcoin economy...a spot where you could exchange bitcoin for cash, bi-directionally. 
The dispensaries have the idle cash, just sitting around...they can't take it to the bank, after all. 
So: customers pay cash for weed, Dispensaries put cash in ATMs, bitcoiners from outside the weed economy get cash *from* ATMs, dispensaries get Bitcoin, which they use to pay their vendors, who can withdraw cash from the same ATMs...repeat...dispensaries become Bitcoin banks...
It produces two of My Favorite Things: More people using bitcoin, and pot smoke...
@_date: 2016-02-17 19:53:27
They don't even want people using cash...

Bitcoin still isn't real money...trying buying a six-pack of beer with it, from a local convenience store. If anything, the stigma from all the criminal activity surrounding Bitcoin will bury it, and prevent it from becoming a widely circulated 'legit' specie.

"We should look to the history of physical cash and traditional electronic banking for security solutions."
There's an app, for that...

It's the futures market, in action...the "sell" bets were made weeks ago
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:19:38
Nobody who bought in a year ago is going to be selling or spending their bitcoin, any time soon...
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:08:52
When the regular money is blockchained, yes, the world will change...
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:55:31
How much did you invest?
In real money, that is...
@_date: 2015-02-24 05:22:22
Am I the only one, who is waiting for an ATM machine that spits out cash, in exchange for my bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-16 01:46:13
It's a government's dream...no more tax evasion.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:05:21
We're all going to need more cash, because everything made with parts from China is going to get much more expensive.

Problem is, bitcoin valuation is inextricably linked to the illicit drug economy, at this point in time. Without black market valuation, there is no reason for it to have value in excess of the dominant (dollar) currency, because of the friction in transactions...you have to convert it, and it is inconvenient. 
And because of it's association with drug money, the entire enterprise is subject to being terminated by various governments, pretty much any moment now....

Then if I can find a vending machine that accepts bitcoin, maybe I will buy a piece of gum...

How much are my collector's Magic: The Gathering cards worth today?
edit: In bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-01 01:18:43
Not anywhere that I actually buy stuff.

They might not be able to stop you, but you might be charged for money laundering, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting terrorism.

Yeah, I would spend $100, for 100 bitcoins...that is an amount I feel comfortable with, in terms of upside and downside risk. 
But spend $99, for 3 bitcoins? No thanks.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:07:50
Sorry, not impressed. Being wealthy enough to donate what other people perceive as "a lot of money" doesn't make you selfless, or inspirational.

If Bitcoin is going to succeed in the long run, it needs to attract new money, but who is going to buy in when prices are that high? 
Not me...time for a split...
@_date: 2013-02-28 20:51:14
Dollar-parity, or below, is the sweet spot, whereby I won't feel like I got egregiously ripped off, if the whole scheme suddenly fails, or my account gets hacked, or I can't redeem coins for some reason.
At $30/coin, the buy-in is too high, and there is too much potential for downside valuation.
@_date: 2013-03-01 01:59:10
A really nice paperweight...
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:04:13
What is the point, of paying $.50, for a fraction of a bitcoin? As pure speculation, maybe, but what can you buy with it right now?
@_date: 2013-02-28 23:18:19
No...I won't be using bitcoin, a year from now, because I am not buying in *today*, because it is too expensive.
@_date: 2013-02-28 21:01:24
It's like stock trading...if you can buy in at 1, if it goes to 2, you have made 100% profit, and you only put one dollar at risk.
But if you buy in at 30, it has to go to 60, to earn that same profit...you are putting much more money at greater risk for the same return, which is by no means certain...it could collapse, back to 2 or 3.
The only thing that is supporting the high valuation, is that you can use bitcoin to buy stuff you can't easily buy, with regular money: illegal mail-order drugs. If that situation changes (and the DEA is working on changing it...), expect the value of bitcoin to collapse, abruptly.
But if bitcoin is to remain a viable alternative currency for legal transactions, it needs to maintain some reasonable valuation, relative to the dominant currency, if it wants to attract new users.

Right now, buying bitcoin is like buying a "penny" stock, after it has broken out to 2 dollars a share...

Also, the part where Customs seized the package full of fake IDs being mailed to his address, in a "routine" border search. Coincidence?
@_date: 2013-03-01 17:30:56
Suppose it came to light that Islamic terrorists were profiteering, from bitcoin...steps would be taken, that might prohibit businesses from accepting bitcoin as payment, and from redeeming bitcoin for cash. 
And it doesn't even have to be a governmental action. If the banking/credit community came to a consensus that bitcoin was bad, they could effectively "blackball" bitcoin...it would be non-convertible, into governmental backed specie, *without* government having to do anything.
