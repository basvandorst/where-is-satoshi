...what?  You should buy if you can actually find it for that price.

Hey guys people are selling Bitcoin at a discount, buy now before it's too late!
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:31:48
I think his point is extremely logical.  Anything the US dollar backs is a solid investment.  If the dollar backs out, then people lose faith in a commodity.  We have one of the most powerful economies on the planet.  Even if Japan owns more Bitcoin than us, it would be a substantial loss if it were banned in the US.

As long as the phone doesn't crash.  You should keep the private key somewhere just in case it does.  That's super important.
I use an old phone with bread as well.  I keep it offline and turned off as much as possible.  I keep the private key to my wallet in a safe just in case.

My mom gave me a few hundred from her gambling fund (consisting of only gambling profits from her rare casino trips; she isn't a serial gambler) and gave it to me.  I've been handling everything for her.  It's a good way to make sure she doesn't make a stupid decision and just lose it all, or add more than she can afford to lose.
Consider managing the money for your mom.  Mine is just happy to be kept up to date, and is hoping to make a little extra for a vacation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:19:27
It's about $19,600
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:57:59
Yeah, I'm not missing a surge up again.  I've known about Bitcoin for years and feel so silly for not buying sub-$100.  It makes sense that something like this would blow up.  Feel so shortsighted.
I wouldn't let that happen again if the price went under $100.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:50:40
Hit the deposit button and deposit your USD from Coinbase to GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:04:45
Use gdax.  It's coinbase for technical people.  No fees if you do limit orders.  Much smaller fees on market orders.  Only issue is that you have to put money in with an ACH, and can't get instant Bitcoin with a debit or credit card -- money has to clear first.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:32:31
Yes.  In fact, your private key works with ALL wallets, so you don't even need to use the same software wallet.

Well, I'm already halfway done with law school with $90k in debt, so there's no turning back at this point.  Plus, I am lucky enough to have a family law firm to work at after I graduate.  The difficult part will be paying off the loans in ten years.  Something like $2800 a month.  Brutal, but it's my best shot at success on my own terms.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:43:00
Identifying when it will jump up and when it will crash is nearly impossible.  It'll bite you in the ass one of these days.

Would be annoying to try to remember.  Try to go with something more complete.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:53:29
It means nobody knows.  People claiming to know are talking out their asses.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:41:54
Everyone here will say yes, but nobody knows if it's a good idea.  I'm inclined to say that you should wait it out.  We just had a 20% increase in a day.  That's obscene.

You realize that there are no laws to protect you if he makes off with your Bitcoin right?  He might do it once or twice, but as soon as he has your trust, he'll screw you, and there will be literally no way for you to recoup your losses.  Don't be stupid.

Breadwallet on mobile is great.

You got lucky.  Try it again when the market starts shooting up wildly.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:49:12
I use breadwallet.  It's pretty solid and just got a new UI upgrade, which looks great.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:29:52
Day trading Bitcoin is stupid.  You'll only ever lose money.  Believe me, I've tried myself, and only ever done it successful one or two times over a period of three months.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:38:08
I've seen this before.  Pretty sure it's a glitch it the GUI on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:05:31
This is absolutely insane.  It honestly looks like a huge pump before a dump to me.  There are, like, no sell orders.  How is this sustainable?
That being said, I'll probably wake up tomorrow to see BTC at $22k.  This is madness.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:38:27
I wish they did.  It'd be a hell of a lot cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:44

There was an IBM cloud commercial on during the Packers game earlier where they said something about selling tomatoes on a blockchain.  It was embarrassing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:52
Yeah because Bitcoin always follows logical trends
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:24:38
There's no reason to do that.  If anything, you should move from Coinbase to a hardware wallet or paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:35:43
1) a lot.  If you're American, there's actually a lot of red tape in the way.  States like New York require you to insure your exchange etc.
2) don't understand the question

It's never a good idea to cash out a retirement fund for risky speculation.  Use some of your emergency fund.  That being said, you shouldn't invest more than 5-10% of your assets unless you can afford to lose it.  You don't even have a source of income, don't be reckless.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:10:31
No, it's the pump and dump and the losers like Ver running disinformation campaigns and taking advantage of the name Bitcoin, and their ownership of the bitcoin.com domain that make it a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:40:30
None of that makes any sense to me, and I literally just took my evidence final last week.  This is all circumstantial hearsay.  Being shady isn't against the law.  All of this would not be admitted because it's all unfairly prejudicial.  If there were any electronic communications, that would be admissible in limited circumstances, but that's not what we're talking about here at all.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:44:41
That's where people think the price will go by whenever the contact time is up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:05:24
You would be surprised what happens when there's a lot of money involved.  I have great friends who I wouldn't expect to start begging for money if I got rich, but being in the legal field, I've heard horror stories from people who thought the same thing.  Money changes people.

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:46:59
It's up to you.  If you trust coinbase, keep it there.  If not, move it.  Most people will say to go ahead and move it, but realize that it'll cost you some money to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:13:36
People have been asking that forever.  Just don't put in more than you can afford to lose.  Then hodl.

Please explain, using the federal rules.

Normal, boring Bitcoin trading volume is somewhere around 15-20k in 24 hours.  That's around when it typically holds steady, or increases or decreases very slowly.  Once you get around 30-40k, shit is either calming down or about to get real.  It's still calming down from the pump and the crash, it's a game of averages.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:32:42
Go to gdax, hit the deposit button, and deposit it from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:20:02
It's normally around 20-25k, on a somewhat boring day.

Yes, buy if you can afford to lose the money.

Exchanges all reflect their own market.  They're not further apart because of the potential for arbitrage between exchanges.  The result is that every exchange is about the same, but disparities can happen when it's not worth it to swap between exchanges, until such a time does come.

The DEA has been prosecuting grow kits for years, at least since 2013, and your disclaimer that they're for microscopy wouldn't hold up in court.  Assuming you're using USPS to ship them, you're also breaking laws by using federal employees as an accessory to commit a felony.  Regardless, you're trafficking drug materials with the intent to cultivate.  Extraordinarily stupid to do publicly on Reddit.  You're not a laboratory, you're some random stoner who likes boomers.

Glad you like your job!  I had an internship at a regulatory agency last semester and hated it.  Next semester I get to practice in my school's clinic under my state's student practice rule, doing the type of law I want to do when I graduate, pro bono.  I'm really looking forward to that.  I like talking to people, and couldn't stand being stuck in a cubicle with no windows all day.  This is super exciting in comparison.  It seems that there's something for every type of person in this field.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:34:26
I'm in Ethereum right now.  Bitcoin is scaring me.  The issue is that it's stagnating only slightly above my buy price.  I'm really regretting missing these gains, but I've been able to sleep at night so that's a positive thing.

Like most things in life, you have to know when to pull out.  How greedy can you get if you started with essentially pennies, you take a risk that grows it to 6 figures, and then you decide to keep risking it?  You'd have to be insane.  Pick a number, pull out 80% for more traditional investment vehicles, and let the 20% ride.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:40:51
I'm a millennial too.  I went to college, graduated, and couldn't make more than $20 an hour in the two years I was out.  I also hated my job.  So now I'm in law school, going $200k into debt.
For the vast majority of people, it's not as simple as "roll up your sleeves and get to work".  I was working 65 hour weeks and getting paid a 40 hr/week salary of $20/hr.  It was ridiculous.  And I was a STEM major.  So now I have to start back at square one with a ton of debt.

Yeah, I sold at about $10k.  Bought initially at that $5400 dip after watching for over a year.  I don't know why I thought the bubble would pop there.  But I genuinely have no idea what to do right now.  Ethereum dipped today, so I bought that at $425.  Hoping it starts climbing again.  If not, oh well.  It's all profit from BTC anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:20:49
You could always plop it into the market sell box and just not hit sell.

Send the Bitcoin from one exchange's wallet to a wallet address on another exchange.  That would be the fastest way.  Not a good idea unless you really know what you're doing though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:44:27
I don't see how you could watch that happen and NOT get suspicious.  But maybe it's due to limitations in their software, in that it's not able to deal with a heavy load.  It is very annoying though, and certainly very suspicious, since Bitcoin maintaining its value benefits them as a company.

It's sad that millennials need to resort to risky speculation in order to buy a house.

Answer to that question is no.

Please raise you are hand?
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:45:21
GDAX is more for people who understand what they're doing, and Coinbase is entry level for casual users.  Coinbase assumes way more risk on that platform vs. GDAX because people are taking the market as opposed to making it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:31:45
Unfortunately, this is all circumstantial hearsay.  None of it would be admissible in court.

Price is going up because supply/demand.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:38:09
Nobody really knows.  Big money could short Bitcoin and sell large amounts at the same time.  Theoretically, short and long futures could balance out stabilizing BTC.  Anyone with a crystal ball will be a very rich man.

@_date: 2017-12-11 03:26:26
It's likely bots, but that's just a guess.  Those started showing up during the bcash fiasco, and most people assumed they were spam transactions to clog up the blockchain.
Your guess is as good as mine.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:42:26
I'm of the opinion that this is the peak of a dead cat bounce.  I think we'll tank to around the $8k level over the weekend, and then steadily recover.  The market moved much too fast, the volume is way too high, even for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:40:07
Using limit orders.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:47:15
Probably based on volatility, tbh.  So either lag or not wanting to take that risk.  They've got to make money, too.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:40:55
People who hold a lot of Bitcoin will take profits and drive the price down, is what he's saying.  I tend to agree, but that remains to be seen.  People here really only like when others say that Bitcoin is going to the moon all the time, without any dips or crashes in the meantime.  I'm sure it will continue to increase, but I'd imagine there will be some hiccups along the way.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:12:50
Seems like a reasonable investment for someone who's not loaded into something as volatile as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:15:42
That's actually the plan.  I'll be a fourth generation lawyer, and I'm planning to go join my dad at the firm he started with my grandpa.  It's been around since the late 80s, and he's built up a solid client base.  The arrangement would be that I do work for him, and give him a percentage of what I bring in, to cover overhead.  Any profit I make would be my own.  Pretty sweet deal.  I'm extremely grateful to have that opportunity.  Certainly beats what I was doing for the two years I took off between college and law school.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:36
That's called arbitrage.  Yes, it's risky because you don't know what price movements will happen while you're transferring the money.  If it were easy to time, everyone would be doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:53:44
You're fine.  I prefer using gdax and most others do too but there's nothing wrong with blockchain.
Good call by the way.

Honestly at this point you should just buy at the next dip.  I bought some earlier today at $6400.  It's looking much healthier now.  If it drops more, just hang onto it and don't sell at a loss.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:39:47
I'm pretty upset with myself for selling at $9700.  I thought it'd hit $10k and plummet.  I wayyy jumped the gun two days ago, apparently.  That being said, where the hell is the correction?  Something is going to happen soon.  If not, I'll be both extremely surprised and extremely disappointed.  But at the same time, we know what prices we're capable of reaching.

You haven't used those addresses to receive Bitcoin.  They're one-time-use.  When you receive Bitcoin, that address goes away.

You may get your wish.  Only time will tell.  I have a feeling it'll drop down to around $5k though.

Oh, I went in and came back out a bunch of times today.  Made a little money but I wouldn't call it fun.  I'm definitely sitting on the sidelines for a bit now and seeing how this plays out.

I sold two a while back, but just bought 1.4 for the hell of it.  Definitely worth the gamble when it seems very likely I'll make up for any losses in Bitcoin moving forward anyway.

Not if you check the flow-through box when you're filling out the IRS form to file for the proprietorship.  I second guessed myself and pulled out my Business Orgs. casebook just to confirm -- should be doable in just about every state.  Certainly something to think about, but I'm sure GDAX or whatever exchange would want proof that you're actually a business entity, and without any filing since a sole proprietorship is essentially a partnership with only one partner, I imagine that that would be pretty difficult.

Honestly, it wouldn't surprise me if it were some sort of tool used for spying.  At the very least, it could be a way to trick people into using their hardware to store national security information (like NSA data center info) in plain sight, without incurring huge cost to the government (or a foreign government).
This could definitely end up being a fun conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:20:07
Analysts were wrong about this run up.  Most analysts are pretty shit at predicting Bitcoin.  In reality, Bitcoin is basically textbook speculation.  It's going to be in economics textbooks in the next couple years, if it isn't already.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:22:26
It's still usable by design.  It just takes longer.  It's extremely expensive to do this, it's been done before, and it won't last.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:05:12
There's no such thing as a Bitcoin "account number" or a "Bitcoin account".  You have a wallet, somewhere on that hard drive if it hasn't been overwritten, that contains a 12-word string that is your private key.  This acts as your password.  The only way to recover the wallet is if you have that passphrase.
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:09:41
No thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:35:13
Look up a dead cat bounce on investopedia.  I'm fairly certain we'll see another dip to previous support levels before it rises up to ~$15k.  That tends to happen with Bitcoin because it's so speculative.
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:20:18
Don't circumvent those restrictions.  Have your parents do it for you, or find another way.  For example, you could buy CSGO skins and cash out in Bitcoin, or buy OSRS gold and resell it in Bitcoin (you'll pay a premium but that's kinda something you have to deal with).  I saw another poster saying that they did that because they weren't 18.
Another option is to find a Bitcoin ATM, but that will also cost a premium.  You could also try LocalBitcoins, but you might get scammed, and you'll pay a premium there too.
Yes, putting in another state is fraud.  Don't do it.

You might as well just buy at a low point today.  I don't see it dipping again until it hits another ATH.
That being said, who knows what'll happen?  I'm just a random internet stranger.

No.  You have to send it out with the appropriate fee attached for optimal delivery time.  Currently that's ~950 satoshis/byte.

Yeah, you're fine.  There's zero chance they'll come after you if you report the overall gains and losses.  To force you to report every single trade would be a ridiculously high standard to set.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:36:58
The price changed too quickly so they didn't honor the purchase.  Happened to me earlier when I didn't refresh the page close enough to clicking buy.

Probably.  There's always a market for niche items.  The only question you have to ask yourself is how high the demand for your product is.  You should also figure out if someone has trademarked the Bitcoin logo yet, because that could end up being catastrophic.

GDAX for the exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:41:06
It was $5500 right before the last fork.  I say watch it tonight, and pull the trigger when it's hovering around $7k.  Don't quote me on this, but I think it will go back up.  Dramatically.  That seems to be the trend with all the big financial institutions getting involved.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:54:45

I keep mine in Coinbase's USD wallet when I'm not actively in Bitcoin with the full amount of money.  I also know how much I put in, and my bank balance ledger tells me what I've actually withdrawn.
If you don't have an exact number, a ballpark number is better than nothing.  Then you can tell the IRS you tried but your records weren't great in the event you get audited.
The best plan would be to ballpark it now, and start keeping records.  I doubt you'll get audited over it, but it's always better to be safe than sorry.
At least that's how I would go after it, and I still can't give you any advice beyond general ideas and my opinion since I'm just a random guy on the internet.  I'm of the opinion that everyone should have some sort of fiduciary to help them with this stuff when they're investing independently -- an accountant is always a good idea.

It is, yes.  Coinbase has a "Bitcoin vault" for this purpose, for example.  Another option would be to keep 0.1 BTC on an exchange and put the other 0.1 BTC in a hardware wallet.

Hey, I mean, I'm 25 and I've only made money doing this.  But I watched Bitcoin from last year when it tanked until it hit $5500 before I pulled the trigger.  There's a smart way and a stupid way to go about things, and I tend to be a little more conservative.  I'd rather be up hundreds now than potentially lose thousands playing trial and error instead of taking my time watching what happens.

Bad idea.  Better idea is to just pay it as regular income if you're not holding it for a year or longer without making trades.  If you hold for a year or longer, pay capital gains on profits.  Simple enough.  We'll have more guidance in the future, I'm sure, but it's not worth getting audited and paying a huge fine for tax evasion, in addition to paying the taxes anyway.
At least, that's what I'm doing.

@_date: 2017-11-17 20:35:43
I'm just speculating, but it looks like they're shorting to me.  I've seen a 170 BTC sell wall on both sides of things several times.  They encourage the market to shoot up before they sell off low, making a little money every time it goes down a bit more encouraging it to drop further.  Pretty easy to do with that kind of wealth.  As soon as they stop, it goes up again.  In my experience, they do it in two hour cycles.

I mean, it doesn't really.  Supply and demand.  Gold went through a bubble period too.  There's very little chance that Bitcoin continues to rise at the rate is has been.  There's always a limit, and when a price rises this fast, it's probably too fast.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:09:02
I think this is a reaction to BCH tanking.  Seems much more likely imo.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:54:20
Sure, but if you set it up as a flow-through proprietorship for purposes of tax, you wouldn't need to worry about tax until you did withdraw, which you could do once a year to ensure it's taxed as capital gains.  The proprietorship isn't taxed, but you're taxed on your distributions.  Or am I missing something?

Only the gains are taxable.  But you're right, it's not worth it when you consider the short-term tax implications.  Pull out $100 in profit and you're only taking home 60-70% of it, so you have to ask yourself why it's worth the risk in the short term.

I'm sure you'll be fine.

I think that right now it's far too volatile, and nobody knows what it'll be doing next.  My plan is to watch what it does for a couple of days before making any bad decisions.  If it explodes like it did from September onward, there will be plenty of time to hop on the train.  I'm not even holding any BTC right now, although I bought and sold the dips and highs over the last 16 or so hours using a small amount of money.  It's not worth stepping into something that's riskier than usual unless you're confident in your ability to come out ahead.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:58:32
Send it to a Coinbase account.  You'll have to verify your identity with it to withdraw to your bank but it won't take much effort.  They'll shut your account down if you send it back to gamble away too, so there's not really any turning back unless you want to lose money.

The IRS is already taxing us.  Profits over a period less than a year are taxed as income.  Profits over a year or longer are taxes as capital gains.  Please report your BTC income to the IRS and pay your taxes.  It adds legitimacy, and you won't end up with a felony tax evasion charge.

I've been watching Bitcoin since 2014-2015.  I bought my first coin some time around then.  I started hodling around $5k though, admittedly.  Honestly, I'd rather lose a little money trading when I notice something that tells me it will crash.  I've more than doubled my initial investment at this point, so I'm fairly confident in my ability to judge it.  This one has me confused, though.  I'll probably watch until between 1am and 3am before making a determination and going to bed.  But this feels like a big dip to me.

Because transactions can only take place when there's a lot of hashpower in the system.  You need miners for Bitcoin to work.  It makes transaction times shorter, which is obviously good for the health of Bitcoin long-term.

The dip is called a dead cat bounce.  I've been saying this since yesterday, that it would drop down again before recovering, since yesterday.  This is very typical of stocks that grow in the way Bitcoin has.  It will test a lower support and then either break out upward, or drop to another support until it hit one people will begin to but at again.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:29:47
I'm kicking myself thinking about the money I had saved up before law school a year and a half ago, when I was using Bitcoin to make digital purchases, and the fact that I didn't have the forethought to buy a bunch and hold it.  I could have 40 BTC right now.  That money would pay for law school and I'd still have $150k to play with.  But hindsight is 20/20.
Instead of grieving over it, I bought what I could afford last month, and it's been doing well.
Doesn't mean it doesn't hurt, though.

I just mine with my gaming PC.  It returns a little, but I more see it as an investment than anything.  I cash out around 0.3 XMR a month without much hashing power.  I think I average around 300 hash/s.  Good enough for me.  Converting electricity into crypto that's just a tad more than the electricity costs is a decent long term strategy imo, since I feel like I'm investing it into the future price of the currency.

They are.  Last I checked, it was about 950sat/byte to get a transaction to go through in a reasonable amount of time.  Everything is going nuts right now.  That being said, hashing power is going back to BTC, so in theory everything should be back to normal in a couple days.  Unfortunately it looks like there's a spam attack too at the moment, and there's no telling how that might continue to screw things up.  Only time will tell.

Mining Bitcoin is generally prohibitively expensive with a really terrible ROI.
Most people mine other coins and trade them for Bitcoin instead.  For example, I mine Monero (XMR) and hold it, while others mine it to exchange for BTC.
It's up to you whether you have faith in an alt coin increasing in a way that would outplay Bitcoin, but it's always better to diversify no matter what space you're in.
Coins like Monero can be mined with a GPU, while Bitcoin requires specialized ASIC miners.  Much more reasonable initial investment (or just using your existing hardware).
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:02:21

@_date: 2017-11-17 17:49:28
You would have to hodl over a year for capital gains to apply.  If, say, you sold when a dip was certain and bought back at the base of the dip every 3-4 months, you're taxed at your effective income tax rate.  So, in practice, it would save you 5% if you were coming in and out on a regular basis.

I'm a law student.
Here's the thing.  You can constructively leave a password, or a key to a safe containing a password, completely legally as a method of constructively giving access to money to someone else.  It should be clear what the value of that asset is, though.  Currently, legally, bitcoin is classified as mostly a ~~security~~ commodity, and should be treated as such.
By not leaving the wealth in a will, the property that results will likely go into probate, and other relatives could very well start arguing about who it belongs to.  That's always bad news.  You never know who in the family is greedy, or just thinks they're entitled to some property.  Death does weird things to people.
The best option, in my opinion, is to form a trust with the bitcoin.  With a trust, you appoint a trustee to manage the trust, and a beneficiary to profit from it.  You submit a document detailing how you would like to manage the trust.  By law in literally every US jurisdiction, that trustee can change the structure of the trust based on the circumstances surrounding the management of that trust.
As such, in the event that bitcoin is for whatever reason going to shit, or if there's something else less risky and more profitable at some point, the trustee has the ability to change how the trust is structured.
This is, by far, the best option no matter what you're doing.
Edit:  I should probably add that this isn't legal advice.  I'm a second year law student, not an attorney.  I have very little experience in trusts and estates outside of class and doing paralegal-type duties in firm specializing in wills, trusts, and estates.

@_date: 2017-10-25 04:11:21
Because you should really only buy on a dip.  No idea why this other guy is telling you not to, when you could be maximizing your profit.
Next time you buy, look at a chart with prices as a function of time.  Only buy if you can see the price fluctuating, tanking a bit, and lower than you would expect as compared to the last couple of days, at least.  You bought it when it was at an all-time high, which is just about the dumbest thing you can do with something as volatile as bitcoin, which will fluctuate around a certain number before either going up or down.  The dip is the best time to buy.  If it tanks, it'll come back up, and you can buy it again at the bottom.
The good news is, now that you own some Bitcoin, you'll start to learn what the market looks like, and have a better feel for when the best time to buy is.  And you can always buy more when it dips.  Hopefully it keeps going up, and that's when the other guy's comment is relevant.
