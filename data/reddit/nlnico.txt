Another factor are potential losses on settlements too, right? For example $38M in BTC longs, settled at $604 while current price is $584 (and lower on "36% announcement") - loss of $1.25M in terms of total BFX assets. Same for ETH/ETC/LTC (although it could result into a gain for total assets too - since ETH price is actually higher now if ETH longs &gt; shorts.)
Another thing is that they probably are holding more ETH/ETC/LTC than the customers have in their balances, since a lot of them are now credited as BFXUSD tokens. Yet they will have to buy back BTC since they don't have enough of that. They could calculate all those assets on the current market price, but it seems a lot more safe to have a bit of margin on that. For example, if they need to sell 300k ETH to get some BTC back for the lost BTC, I doubt they would use the exact current ETH price since such big OTC trade would probably be discounted (= loss for total BFX assets.)
So maybe it makes sense to initialy have a higher percentage of socialized losses, so at least they should be "solvent enough" to honor withdrawals of 64% of the customers assets. Then if they are able to get good prices for "shifting" those assets, they *should* be able to pay out a few % relatively quickly.
Conclusion: need full transparency of assets before and after hack/settlement to really know what's going on. It's obviously all messed up though.

I understand that's the cheapest way. But as service you want to offer fast/automated withdrawals and if you run out of your hot-wallet consolidation input, you might want to use high amount inputs (that are in same hot-wallet from deposits) for withdrawal TXs too.
You could argue you can do this ahead, but you want to keep the hot wallet limited and sending manually from cold to hot takes time so isn't always ideal either.
Overall there are a lot of possibilities, didn't even talk about RBF yet, that can help to get the lowest fee needed too. One thing is for sure: Coinbase at least needs to do *something*.

Correct, underlying fund would buy/sell futures contracts. Market makers arbitrage the futures though, so it *should* still affect the bitcoin price. But not as direct as previous ETF proposals, like the Winklevii one, that would hodl/trade/store actual bitcoin.

I find it pretty likely that blockchain analysis companies can follow these typical "chain withdrawal TXs" just as easy.
If you get withdrawals directly from deposit addresses (assuming no consolidation), it gets more tricky. But still decent analysis can figure out which inputs belong to a wallet when final change addresses gets spent with other inputs (like advanced version of 
Overall batching (especially done in a pretty bad way like BitFinex with 1 hot wallet address) does make it a bit easier for the average user to figure out. But regardless of that, I think privacy already needs improvement and is very difficult to maintain with bitcoin (regardless of batching.)

Actually more importantly, `addwitnessaddress`is only meant as debugging tool, so even for services that use Core CLI, it's better to wait for Core 0.16.0 IMO. Of course bigger services that use highly modified nodes/wallets and have dedicated developers for it, should be able to implement segwit already.
So IMO it's still too early for this whole "boycott" idea until Core 0.16.0 is out (but just asking services to add it is great of course.)

I didn't analyze their TXs. But the idea would be to consolidate with real low fee so it gets confirmed when fees in mempool are relatively low (and it's okay if it takes a while.) Then for withdrawals you can still aim for few-block confirmation with relatively high fee.
But I think an exchange would still consolidate with those batched WD TXs, probably just using highest input amounts (so it could still consolidate lower amounts with low fee.)

@_date: 2017-12-28 13:06:59
It is true according to the Core developers. From [nullc](


Some quotes from pwuille ("the creator of segwit"):






I could get a lot more quotes, because this is pretty well known among the developers. While you can certainly use `addwitnessaddress` if you understand how it works (manually, also for change address) and what the potential risks are (not easily finding it back if you didn't update backup every time, etc.) - sure you can use it! But for the average user just waiting for good support in 0.16.0 is better IMO and calling it "meant for debugging" is very much correct.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:26:42
Ah okay, so I am guessing the segwit discount make them equilevant to 100+ sat/byte non-segwit TXs ;)

That reply is pretty accurate. Like it says, good support for both ps2h and native segwit addresses will be in 0.16.0 and this is being prioritized. What exactly are you looking for?

First of all, nice that you started this.. I hope it encourages services (and users) to use segwit :)
A few suggestions. Like I said [yesterday]( I think it should have a few columns for bech32. [The format]( (and icons) of seems good to me. 'Ready' and 'NOT READY' is also silly, both don't have segwit. I understand it's fun to hate on Coinbase, but as long as exchanges like Bitfinex don't have segwit either.. they should have the same status :p
If renames [his site]( (even though 'SegwitShameWall' sounds fun, it should be positive IMO :p) and IMO removes his donation address (it should be a *community* effort to get all the data *together* - no offense :x) - then it would be great to use/link that site/github too and just post the daily (or every few days :x) status here (by you Bastiat if you are around.) Basically will be more easy to collect data that way :) We could add other services too, categorize them etc.
Additionally yesterday's topic already had a few updates: [Bitfinex]( has batching, [LocalBitcoins]( has batching but no segwit, [Kraken]( has segwit, .. not sure if others.

Huh. It is based on base unit:


And used by some sites already, like one of the most popular gambling sites bustabit.com. This BIP is here to encourage more software developers and website to implement "bits".

For wallets that would be preferred, especially because they could support both like Electrum does (although better call it "p2sh segwit" and "bech32 segwit".) For services I am not sure, because they would support only 1 at the time. But could be.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:16:24
Exactly the same :) Using Trezor on Electrum 3 is described in [this blog post]( (but is obviously the easy part anyway, compared to setting up the full node and Electrum server.)

The min fee has been 100+ sat/byte in last 24h:  It means you either got very lucky or you are using segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:06:44
As of now, it's only possible with another service on top, for example an Electrum server:
1. Run Bitcoin Core with txindex=1 and RPC enabled in config
2. Run [electrumx]( (use correct config and you could use leveldb torrent for quicker sync.)
3. Connect [Ledger Nano S to Electrum]( and connect directly to your Electrum server for full privacy and security of your full node (ideally with "oneserver" option)
It is obviously not *very* easy and hopefully Core will have "native hardware wallet support" some time in the future. But still this is the best way to use a hardware wallet at this moment IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:14:27
Let's say a service has 100 withdrawals of 0.5 BTC in an hour and initially has 1 input (deposit) adress that has 70 BTC.
Typically if it would make a transaction for each withdrawal, you would get a chain of transactions. So the first withdrawal is: 1 input (initial 70 BTC), 2 outputs: 0.5 to the withdrawal address and ~69.5 BTC to the change address. Second withdrawal is: 1 input (that ~69.5 BTC change address) and 2 outputs: 0.5 to the withdrawal address and ~69 BTC to the new change address. Etc.
By batching the withdrawals, they could do 1 big transaction every hour (or x minutes) with all transactions. So this would require: 1 input (initial 70 BTC), 1 output for each withdrawal (100x 0.5 BTC) and 1 change address (~20 BTC) for all withdrawals. So this drastically reduces the amount of inputs/outputs and therefor making the total transaction size for all withdrawals much smaller.
Overall this massively decreases the space it needs in the blockchain (and therefor reduces the mempool and fees if more services use it.) It is generally only relevant for services that do a lot of transactions (and they save fees themselves already if they use it.) But in theory users could also do it, by waiting till you need to make multiple payments and then sending money to multiple addresses in 1 transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:46:48
`mempoolexpiry` is a configuration option like `maxmempool`.
By default a Bitcoin Core node has a 2 week expiry and 300 MB max. Currently that's 116k TXs, 112MB of TXs (but 300MB usage), resulting into mempoolminfee of 16 sat/byte.
Obviously *you* also get the lower fee TXs because of your `maxmempool` setting. I was just curious if you also have transactions that other nodes consider expired.
Interesting to know that's 825MB - that does sound like a lot. Then again, spamming very low fee TXs would be without much risk (and not really a problem IMO - except for people with high limits like yourself.) Looking at "*min fee needed to get into a block within a day*" is more relevant and that has been going down whole week at least (but was temporarily really too high.)
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:15:47
FYI: Bitfinex has a [public hot wallet address]( and you can see they do batching (perhaps not in an ideal way, but at least some batching.)
IMO at this point '*Ready*' for Segwit is silly. There are just 3 options: **segwit p2sh**, **segwit bech32** or **no segwit** (of course they might wait for bech32 until more wallets support it.)
Another interesting status to follow is '*Send to bech32 status*'.. if the wallet/service allows sending/withdrawing to native segwit (bech32) addresses.
edit: overall I would recommend to make it like this:
| Exchange            | Batching Status | Segwit Status | Withdraw to bech32|
| Binance             | **Yes** 		| No 			| ? 				|
| Bitfinex            | **Yes**			| No         	| ? 				|
| Bitonic             | ?         		| No            | No 				|
| Bitstamp  		  | **Yes**  		| **Yes**, p2sh | ? 				|
| Bittrex             | **Yes**			| ?             | ? 				|
| Coinbase/GDAX       | No     			| No            | ? 				|
| etc.
Of course I don't expect services to use bech32 until other services and wallets support sending to bech32. But at least this way we encourage them to think about it already. And I hope they can enable sending/withdrawing to bech32 already (this is just adjusting some validation script - relatively very easy.)

You do not need to run your node 24/7 365.
By running a full node and using it for transactions, you are actively enforcing network rules and cannot be forced onto changes by anyone else. A small group of businesses and miners cannot force changes to the rest of the community that runs and uses full nodes. *That* is the power of running a full node and the power of decentralization.
This is besides the regular advantages: security (fully validate all TXs), major privacy advantages, more nodes on network makes it more resistant against attacks/DDoS, etc.
So overall, you can definitely just run your full node only when you need it (you might need to run a few hours every time to catch up the latest blocks.) Of course it's nice to run your node 24/7 365, especially if you have fast internet speeds, so you can actively help new nodes setting up, serve SPV wallets, etc. But the main advantages of running a full node don't require that, in my opinion.

Well at first the Core developers made the code/logic that takes care of segregating the witness, allowing miners to enable it, etc. That was already a lot of work with probably more testing than ever. Since Core only can put forward suggestions and there is no guaranteed that it would be activated on the network, it doesn't really make sense to have it already in the wallets/GUI.
Especially because it took like a year before segwit got activated.. in the end there was no guarantee that segwit would be enabled at all.. so why would volunteers waste hundreds/thousands of extra development hours on that?
Anyway, you can follow the progress here:  It is a lot more work than I expected with a lot of reviewers testing too. Everyone can help too by reviewing.
Of course I also hoped segwit would have better support in Core already before and truthfully I was also a bit "disappointed". But it is what it is, in the end it's just volunteers developing on a project.
Overall, I do agree that we cannot expect everyone to move to segwit yet. And even though I think it's nice to encourage services to enable segwit already, I think it's fair if they want to wait for Core 0.16.0 too.
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:44:12
Ah, like that. Agree.

To give you some more background:
In the province there is not a lot of work. So a lot of people, especially ~20 year olds go to Manila (or other big cities) after college (or even after high school if they can't afford college) to work. In the Philippines it's expected/normal that even the children take care of their family if they earn some money. So a part of their income, they will send from Manila to the province. Because there is so much demand for sending money throughout the Philippines - and banks are pretty terrible (minimum balance etc) - there are a lot of so called "pawn shops". They offer "money transferring services" even to relatively small towns. A bit like national western unions. So people earn money in the big cities and use these services to send money back to their family even in the smaller towns.
All the bitcoin remittance companies in the Philippines also use this infrastructure. Obviously there are fees involved in using those "pawn shops". This is why "bitcoin remittance" is not always cheaper when using this route. Of course those bitcoin remittance companies also offer a "bank option" which has much lower fees or is even free, so this way, I personally save a lot of money by using them to send money to my bank account.

It is a public ledger. You can see everyone's transactions. So it's pretty much the opposite of anonymous - completely transparent. However, you don't necessarily know the person behind the transaction, so it's pseudonymous. If the addresses of your transactions are never linked to you, it's anonymous. That seems easier than it is.

Ledger could be an option for those on low budget, but it is far from the security of a Trezor.
- Shows mnemonic seed on PC first time of setting up the Ledger.
- The security card can be cracked by advanced malware after few transactions.
- 2FA is great. But in theory a free software solution that uses 2-of-2 multisig between PC and phone seems the same to me? Correct me if I am wrong at this point.
Either way, the Trezor with display is by far better for security, but bit more expensive obviously.

I agree, license is better proof that you haven't been cheated than math (provably fair.) Also who cares about instant deposits/withdrawals when you can have fun waiting/hoping for weeks for your money. Also in case of sites like LockPoker, it sucks it was a scam and many lost huge amounts, but at least it was a licensed scam. Most dice sites even have proof of solvency (signed public address) so you know they can pay you out on big win, but gotta trust that license more.
Don't get wrong, have to stay away from new sites and don't trust your money too long on any site. Also licensed sites could start using those advantages currently used by bitcoin gambling sites. But IMO you highly overestimate a license. It's basically just to earn some money for the gov.

Bitcoin allows you to be your own bank. This gives you complete control over your own money, but it comes with responsibilities. You will indeed need to arrange your own security, bankups and inheritance possibilities. Perhaps the industry (ledger, trezor, etc) can come up with even better solutions than the current hardware wallets. A "safety net" would be equivalent to allowing transactions to be reversed by some superpower, obviously that will never happen. Educating people and having simple tools available for the average user to control/transact bitcoin securely is the way to go.

I am pro-bitcoin and accepting donations with bitcoin is great. But I hope you realize that donating and advertising are completely different models. And not every website is good for a donation model.
Anyway, good luck :)

I actually made a [calculation]( the other day and concluded ***BitPesa really seems always between 1-2% till 10% cheaper than 2 of the "traditional remittance services"***.
But I guess it's more expensive in UK than EUR with SEPA transfers?
@_date: 2018-05-31 10:06:00
From my perspective the advantage of bitcoin is being in complete control of your own money. Sure I could put my bitcoins in Xapo Vault and they are experts in securing my bitcoin, so that might be more secure. But technically I won't own bitcoins anymore, just tokens on the Xapo database that supposedly represent bitcoins. I don't see why I would own "bitcoin" (tokens) in that situation... just as speculative investment against government-controlled currencies or something?
Also I do think that bitcoin allows new possibilities for securing it compared to cash, gold, etc in your home. For example 2 out of 3 multisig (hardware) wallets (that are physically in other places), wouldn't be possible with most other assets. Somewhat ironically you could actually put 1 of those in a safety deposit box in a bank (if available), but at least the bank wouldn't be able to control your money. Or just digitally like BitGo multisig, although that wouldn't counter all attacks.
Overall, I do agree that securing against **all** possible bad scenarios is extremely difficult. But ideally I would see solutions from security experts (ledger, trezor, etc) that counter all possible scenarios (only hardware wallets isn't enough) and still allow you to be in control of your own money.
Ps, I do agree insurances could be a possibility, which is equivalent to a safety net, although I can understand the hesitance from insurance companies because of possible fraud and even just incompetence in securing bitcoins.

Not really. Although there is for example this research:


For example, 53.3% of the surveyed individuals reported that they do not use, or do not know how to use email; 30% did not have a bank account and, while 92% had mobile phones, more than 80% of these could not access the internet.
Thus, the vast majority of migrants are still using the MTCs for cash-to-cash transfers per this study, with 90% using MTCs, 3% using banks, 2% using the internet and one respondent preferring to send cash in the US ma
il (26.9% indicated that Western Union was their preferred provider, 7.5% La Nacional, 6.3% MoneyGram, 5% Vigo, and 4.9% Delgado Travel).
"*2% using the internet*" whoops! Lol. The biggest part do use "cash pickup" though. I am also not sure how representative "*1,000 Latino immigrants in US*" are. If anyone has a better research that would be great.
Anyway, the remittance from the Filipino oversea workers in 2013 was $25.1 billion ^[source]( . If just 0.1% of that ($25M) use or have the capability to use internet and their families use the cash pickup method, they can save some serious money with the Bitcoin method.
Also imagine if the Bitcoin ATMs do handle remittance services.. that would be pretty awesome. Just put some cash in the ATM at the country you work and chose the remittance method. Then ideally sites like Rebit have already partnered up with M Lhuillier and the others (so they can use some kind of automatic API), and within 1-6 confirmations the other party can pick-up their money for 1-17% less than their current methods :) ^(I am not sure about the Bitcoin ATM fees though.) But what I mean is.... this is just the start :)
Also my numbers were not meant to say how great Bitcoin is, or how the remittance market will change, I just wanted to show the numbers with the 2 methods :)

In this scenario, I would argue that the bigger advantage of bitcoin is that your friend is able to make deposits to a poker site at all. Many banks and centralized systems like Paypal won't allow poker site transfers - especially in the US. Why would someone not be allowed to play with their own 100 bucks for some entertainment? With bitcoin there is no one to censor or stop their transactions, showing one of the true advantages of decentralized money.

I don't think remittance with BTC will be done by 1 business. That is my whole point. It will be "decentralized" with relatively small businesses offering to buy and sell BTC while being "connected" to each other.
If bitcoin ATMs have a user-friendly feature to use it for remittance (eg send the BTC you are buying directly to a company that sells BTC in the country you want to send money too), the usage of ATM could increase. These individual ATM operators could therefor lower the fees.
Since these are just simple single bitcoin ATMs (probably in the future even cheaper to buy) operated mostly by 1 guy or company, the costs are not that insane. I understand right now it is not really profitable and I understand the 5-10% fees. But if 436 million USD would be the buy pressure on these ATMs I am sure the fees could be lower. There are now like 200 bitcoin ATMs in public? If we make the assumption 0.1% of the remittance market would go though these ATMs and there is a 1% fee on the buy-side it's a yearly $21.800 revenue for each bitcoin ATM just for this remittance purpose. I think there are enough individual people willing to operate a bitcoin ATM for $21.8k (+ "normal" buying/selling of BTC.)
Of course it's the question if people will really use it for remittance. Will just these 200 ATMs really "get" 0.1% of the remittance market? Probably not. But I do think it is possible to get relatively low fees if there is more remittance volume in an infrastructure with bitcoin as underlying protocol between 2 different buy/sell companies.

I guess my project is not that special considering all the innovative and creative ideas here. But I made a overview of "dice gambling sites" based on their statistics (that are updated automatically): 
The bitcoin gambling scene made instant cash-outs, very low 1% house-edges and provably fair methods (way to make sure you, as a player, are not cheated) the norm. Which IMO is way better than all traditional fiat online casinos out there. In my opinion it's a good example of self-regulation too. Dice games are the most popular games in the bitcoin gambling scene and my overview is a fair comparison for those sites.

Agree. I reported a reflected XSS once on one of their programs. It was fixed after 1 day. I was ignored for over a month. And finally got a reply that they couldn't reproduce it (yeh, no shit, you already fixed it.) CrowdCurity said they couldn't help me, because they are "*only offering a marketplace for bug programs*", not actively giving support. Well great.
Sure reflected XSS is not the biggest deal, but if it is not specifically "out of scope", it should have a low reward at least.
TL;DR: agree, I only use bug bounty programs that sites are offering themselves now.

International brands like Samsung are more expensive here than in USA/EU (in my experience.) But there are a lot of local brands which offer phones with pretty good specifications for a lot less.
edit: I noticed this FF phone was sold on Snapdeal, so I looked on that site, so for **India**:

Yes. You should never look at fees, always at "*how much local currency do I get for my currency*".
I just made a comparison between WesternUnion and Kraken+Rebit too. Note: I calculated with the WesternUnion fees from Netherlands / Germany / probably others. I personally cannot get 0 fees. They seem to have random "promos" to have 0 fees in some countries -sometimes-.
**150 EUR**
* ***bank-to-bank***
* WesternUnion: 150 EUR (incl 4.90 fee) = **7,939.31 PHP**
* Kraken + Rebit: 150/298.9\*0.9965 = 0.50008364001, calculate on rebit: 0.50008364001/101\*100 = 0.49513231684 (including fee: 0.50006600 BTC) = **8,128.15 PHP**
* ***bank-to-cash***
* WesternUnion: 150,00 EUR (including 9.90 fee) = **7,665.73 PHP**
* Kraken + Rebit + Palawan Express: (16416.12\*0.50008364001/101\*100-180)/16416.12 = 0.48416748471 (including fee: 0.50005800 BTC) = **7,948.15 PHP**
**500 EUR**
* ***bank-to-bank***
* WesternUnion: 500 EUR (incl 4.90 fee) = **27,089.94 PHP**
* Kraken + Rebit: 500/298.89\*0.9965 = 1.66700123791, calculate on rebit: 1.66700123791/100.9\*100= 1.65213204947 (including fee: 1.66699500) = **27,121.60 PHP**
* ***bank-to-cash***
* WesternUnion: 500,00 EUR (including 14.90 EUR) = **26,542.78 PHP**
* Kraken + Rebit + Palawan Express: (16416.12\*1.66700123791/100.9\*100-300)/16416.12 = 1.63385732925 (including fee: 1.66700300 BTC) =  **26,821.60 PHP**
**1000 EUR**
* ***bank-to-bank***
* WesternUnion: 1000 EUR (incl 4.90 fee) = **54,447.99 PHP**
* Kraken + Rebit: 1000/298.89\*0.9965 = 3.33400247583, calculate on rebit: 3.33400247583/100.85\*100 = 3.30590230623 (including fee: 3.33398400) = **54,270.09 PHP**
* ***bank-to-cash***
* WesternUnion: 1000.00 EUR (including 24.90 EUR) = **53,353.67 PHP**
* Kraken + Rebit + Palawan Express: (16416.12\*3.33400247583/100.85\*100-570)/16416.12 = 3.27118033782 (including fee: 3.33404100 BTC) =  **53,700 PHP**
* \*0.9965 is the 0.35% fee of Kraken
* 298.89 was the lowest "Ask offer" of at least 2 bitcoins during this comparison in the orderbook of Kraken. In theory you could get more bitcoins if you wouldn't market-buy.
* The /101\*100 or /100.85\*100 is the level-fee of Rebit
* The -180, -300, etc are the fees of Palawan Express.
* Basically with that rebit calculation I calculate the amount of Bitcoin I can fill in, since it must be "excluding fees".
* On the latest comparison we transfer 53.7K through Palawan Express with fees of 570. But we could have transferred 50K with 380 fees, so relatively we could even save more there if we use optimal fee-levels.
* In my experience local WesternUnion cash-agents here in the Philippines will still get an extra % of the amount. Unfortunately there is no transparency about this, but it could mean WU is even more expensive.
TL;DR: Kraken+Rebit seems cheaper in almost all situations compared to WesternUnion except for 1000 EUR bank-to-bank transfers.

Wow, your friends are such bitcoin enthusiasts they need this cool project to be interested in beer? Nice.
@_date: 2014-09-04 03:10:07
The other day I made a comparison for remittance to the Philippines and concluded that bank &gt; bank is still 1% cheaper with WU, but Bitcoin is 1% till 17%(!) cheaper for "cash pickup" methods. [See here](
Since I really like the concept of remittance with Bitcoin, but I do like fair comparisons, I will **compare Bitpesa with WesternUnion and WorldRemit** ("traditional remittance services".)
First of all Bitpesa is using the same "marketing techniques" as any other remittance service, saying they don't have transfer fees but charging 3% exchange rate fees. Anyway I am not interested in fees or percentages, I want to know how much KES I get out of ... EUR. Also "even" WU does not offer a "to bank" option to Kenya (not like to the Philippines.)
- For 1000 EUR ^((975+25)^) I get 110287.59 KES (110.29)
- For 300 EUR ^((285+15)^) I get 32237.91 KES (107.46)
- For 100 EUR ^((93+7)^) I get 10519,74 KES (105.20)
- For 20 EUR ^((18+2)^) I get 2036.08 KES (101.80)
- For 1000 EUR ^((978+22)^) I get 110608 KES (110.61)
- For 300 EUR ^((290+10)^) I get 32798 KES (109.33)
- For 100 EUR ^((95+5)^) I get 10744 KES (107.44)
- For 20 EUR ^((18+2)^) I get 2036 KES (101.80)
So WorldRemit is a bit cheaper than WesternUnion.
For 1000 EUR I get (1000/361.77081\*(1-0.0035)) = 2.75450636827 BTC.
For 1000 EUR I get [1309.20 USD]( so (500/474.87\*(1-0.005)+500/474.87\*(1-0.0048)+309.2/474.87\*(1-0.0046)) = 2.74365127298 BTC (bit odd calculation because of fee levels.)
So, even though they just raised their fees, Kraken is cheaper at this moment therefor I will use Kraken. I can use this amount of 1000 EUR because there is the same percentage fee on buying the Bitcoin. So 10 EUR will be the same as 1000 EUR (however for simplicity I just use "last trade price" and assume I can buy 1000 EUR on that price.)
- (2.75450636827\*40900) = 112659.310462 KES / 1000 EUR (112.66)
So basically I get 112.66 KES for every EUR.
**So..** With BitPesa you **112.66 KES**/EUR. With WorldRemit you get **101.80 KES**/EUR (10% less) for small amounts and **110.61 KES**/EUR (2% less) for big amounts.
**Is that all?** No. BitPesa sends it to your mobile phone (M-Pesa, Orange, Airtel, or Yu) These providers still charge a fee if you want to withdraw that money. WorldRemit has the option to send it also to M-Pesa, but they can also send it to their [partners]( (fees unknown unfortunately - but might be free.) WesternUnion sends it also to 1 of their agents and states "they may charge an extra fee".
Anyway let's see how much you get from BitPesa in the end. [Here are the M-Pesa W/D fees]( EDIT: I used ATM withdrawal fees, probably the cheaper "agent fees" are used though):
- (20/361.77081\*(1-0.0035))\*40900 = (2253-33) = 2220 (111)
- (100/361.77081\*(1-0.0035))\*40900 = (11265.93-193) = 11072 (110.72) - 11K is just above the "10K fee level"
- (300/361.77081\*(1-0.0035))\*40900 = (33797-193-193) = 33411 (111.37)
- (1000/361.77081\*(1-0.0035))\*40900 = (112659-193-193-193-193-193-193) = 111501 (111.50)
^((They have a max fee of 193 for max 20K w/d so you will need 6 w/ds for that last one.)^)
So even if WorldRemit has no extra fee at 1 of their partners, BitPesa is still cheaper!
**TL;DR BitPesa really seems always between 1-2% till 10% cheaper than 2 of the "traditional remittance services".**
^(Note 1: I use EUR because I use EUR :p Be free to compare the same with USD.)
^(Note 2: If I made any calculation mistake PLEASE correct me. Always do your own math anyway, these numbers change every day too!)

It depends on:
- amount (generally traditional remittance seems to charge relatively a lot for small amounts and bitcoin mostly just a percentage)
- sender country (how easy/cheap is it to buy bitcoin?)
- receiver country (is there a bank infrastructure? cash pickup infrastructure? mobile load - cash pickup infrastructure?)
- payment method (fast with credit-card or cheap on "real exchange"?)
- receive method (bank or "pickup"?)
- current bitcoin trend (most especially because spreads can be bigger between exchanges and if sending the bitcoin around takes you an hour you could win or lose on the bitcoin price)
- possible arbitrage advantages/disadvantages
- accepted delay (bitcoin seems slower if you include buying/selling bitcoins, especially if you want to do it cheap through a real exchange)
- etc.
I made some comparisons before with traditional remittance services like WU and WorldRemit:
- [The Philippines]( - 1% - 17% cheaper for cash-pickup, but actually 1% more expensive for bank&gt;bank in some situations.
- [Kenya (BitPesa)]( - 1-2% till 10% cheaper.
- [Guinea]( - Seems 17% cheaper, but untested and not 100% sure if it will work (through buying mobile load and cashing it out.)
The biggest savings seems to be on small amounts and especially if "cash pickup" is being used. For countries without any bank infrastructure this seems even more relevant. IF the bitcoin community/companies can make the necessary infrastructure to sell bitcoins there (like BitPesa and the ones in the Philippines.)

I will compare this with the Philippines.
Prepaid 30 days plan:
- 100 MB - 99 PHP = 2.27 USD (Globe)
- 700 MB - 299 PHP = 6.86 USD (Globe)
However, what is often used in the province is a daily package, something like this:
- Unlimited calls, 20 texts and 15 MB for 1 day - 20 PHP = 0.46 USD (Globe&amp;Smart)
- Unlimited calls, texts, Facebook &amp; Twitter for 1 day - 25 PHP = 0.57 USD (Globe)
- Unlimited Facebook for 1 day - 2 PHP = 0.046 USD (Smart)
^(Globe and Smart are the biggest 2 mobile providers)
It is correct that much much more people have mobile phones (basic ones, without internet) than landlines. Actually I know a lot of families who do not have food sometimes but they do have a mobile phone^*. Basically they often have family working in Manila or even abroad, so a mobile phone is really important for communication. A lot of people have also Facebook (even without having internet) so that's why some "packages" are focused on Facebook too.

Cool idea :) a few ideas:
1. For USD, RUR, EUR, CNH and GBP you can generate BTC-E codes. This is exactly what you need, but unfortunately no CAD. I am afraid that foreign currencies are more difficult too?
2.  also offers "redeemable codes". It seems there is a 2.5% fee and for "fiat codes" your students need "level 2 verification" - whatever that means. So you will have to look that up but since they support CAD I think this is your best solution.
Nerdy solutions (I made some nerdy solutions before realizing vaultofsatoshi offered it):
1. You could use a Canadian bitcoin exchange, make random login details, deposit $200 CAD, buy BTC for $180 CAD, make another random login details, withdraw your BTC from the first account and transfer to the next. Repeat until you have login details for all participants with each $20 CAD. You can automate the process if it's too slow (decent programmer can do this - maybe a student). You can ask the exchange if they are willing to do this for you (and/or if it's allowed.) Not very practical, but it's possible.
2. In theory a script for this is not very difficult. Store gift IDs in a DB. Upon entry of a valid one, use API to buy $20 CAD worth of BTC and withdraw it to the given BTC address. Obviously you will need a programmer for this. You will not suffer from the fluctuation risk, but you do risk potential hack possibilities. Not ideal, but possible.
3. Make your own gift IDs, print them together with a new email address for redeeming + some instructions. You could then manually send BTC to those who email you. You could also make a Contact form on Google Docs to make this look more "official" - make a short link with bitly.com to print on the gift card. ~~You might actually make some money if some people don't redeem it.~~
TL;DR: Probably Vault of Satoshi supports gift cards for CAD :)

Remittance through Bitcoin is not (yet) cheaper in all situations, it depends on a lot of factors. But I had a quick look.. from UK to VN (perhaps you are from AU or NZ instead.. but you didn't say :P)
 has a flat fee of 5 GBP. Let's say we are sending 150 GBP (so 145 GBP with OrbitRemit)
145.00 = **4,815,542.89 VND**
In UK there are several ways to buy bitcoins, according to:  currently 239.27 GBP is the cheapest:
150/239.27 = 0.83587578885
 In VN there seems to be 2 exchanges:
*  (Sell: 7,719,700 VND - Fee: 0.001 % + 42,800 VND)
*  (Sell:7,100,000 VND)
So Bitcoin Vietnam seems the cheapest:
0.62690684164\*7,719,700\*0.99999-42,800 = **4,796,684.35 VND**
So OrbitRemit indeed seems slightly more cheap in this situation. Since they have a flat fee of 5 GBP for smaller amounts BTC will be cheaper. We can solve this by some math: (x-5)\*33210.6406 = x/239.27\*7,719,700\*0.99999-42,800 I am just putting this on wolframalpha for solution: x = 130.09 So for amounts of 130.09 GBP or less the BTC way is cheaper, for higher amounts OrbitRemit is cheaper (at -this- moment.)
A few considerations:
* Maybe it is cheaper to convert GBP to EUR and send a free SEPA transfer to one of the "real BTC exchanges". I am not sure what the cheapest way to buy BTC is in the UK.
* In the future there might be more competition in Vietnam for bitcoin "exchanges" which could give better prices.
* The "cheapest way to send money" seems to be different all the time in my experience, so keep looking for cheap and good solutions, no matter if it is with bitcoin or not :)
**TL;DR** it *looks* like sending from UK to VN is cheaper with bitcoin for amounts of 130 GBP or less, and cheaper with traditional way "OrbitRemit" for higher amounts.

It is possible to send bitcoins to Rebit and they will send it nationally to a "cash pickup" point so the receiver can pick-up Philippine pesos in even small villages.
That was your "suggestion", right?

I am afraid currently the Bitcoin usage within Guinea is very low. And I am afraid companies who buy/sell BTC like BitPesa are not **yet** active there.
However there are fiat competitors of WesternUnion that look cheaper. I did a simple calculation with 200 EUR and it seems WorldRemit is 2.2% cheaper. (  - first transaction even more cheaper with code "FREE" ) Just make sure the "[pickup locations]( are okay for you (only in Conakry!) Worth a look :) might be different day to day or with other amounts.
I do think Bitcoin will be great for remittance. In the Philippines I am personally using it a lot already (since there are several buy/sell companies and exchanges.) For sure there will be a provider for Guinea in the future too.
@_date: 2014-08-26 13:48:39
I have seen topics like this before, time for a real comparison.
My background: have used rebit.ph and coins.ph for remittance, but definitely also westernunion, worldremit etc. I have a script to compare the bitcoin and fiat methods and I might make a site with simple instructions+comparisons in the future.
One thing... you should never use percentages or fee amounts to compare. In the end its about: how much peso will I get with ... euro.


Actually from a NL bank to PH bank WU does NOT have a fee(!!!) I see the same on the german WU, didn't try others.
For 1000 EUR I get 57233 PHP (57.233)
For 300 EUR I get 17170 PHP (57.233)
For 25 EUR I get 1430 PHP (57.2)
So basically I get **57.233 PHP** for every EUR no matter what.
For 1000 EUR I get (1000/389\*(1-0.002)) = 2.565552 BTC.
For 1000 EUR I get [1314.7 USD]( so (500/511.25\*(1-0.005)+500/511.25\*(1-0.0048)+314.7/511.25\*(1-0.0046)) = 2.5591 BTC.
So Kraken is cheaper at this moment (and normally in my calculations too) therefor I will use Kraken.
(2.565552/101\*100\*22282.37) = 56600 PHP (56.6)
So basically I get **56.6 PHP** for every EUR. ^(Since the fees are always 1% with the bank option, the amount doesn't matter.)


For 1000 EUR I get 55802,54 PHP (55.80254)
For 300 EUR I get 16597,68  PHP (55.32)
For 25 EUR I get 1144,67 PHP (45.7868)
For 1000 EUR I get (((1000/389\*(1-0.002))-400/22282.37)/101\*100\*22282.37) = 56204 PHP (56.204)
For 300 EUR I get (((300/389\*(1-0.002))-300/22282.37)/101\*100\*22282.37) = 16683 PHP (55.61)
For 25 EUR I get (((25/389\*(1-0.002))-80/22282.37)/101\*100\*22282.37) = 1335 PHP (53.4)
^(the 400, 300, 80 are fees for the M Lhuillier option, nationwide used, the 400 is little bit cheating with 56K cuz the max is 50K but fair enough imo)
**Conclusion/TL;DR**: currently Bitcoin method is cheaper for "bank&gt;cash pickup" (1% for high amounts, 17% cheaper for small amounts.) But WU seems cheaper for "bank&gt;bank" (1% for all amounts). Can be different day to day, make your own calculations.
"*cash pickup and small amounts*" are the ones that the "poor people" with family abroad use (in my personal experience of the people I know), so I do think bitcoin can help a lot for that, especially since this is just the start.
If I made any mistake, please let me know(!)
edit: formatting
edit2: BTW sorry I only focus on EUR, that is just my personal usage :P be free to make the same comparison with USD :)

That is pretty cool, nice work. I recommend you put some text about "sending money to Guinea with bitcoin", "remittance", etc. so it's easier to find with Google :)
I always like to do math and fair comparisons, like with [BitPesa/Kenya]( and [The Philippines]( So here we go:
- 104.99 EUR = ***844,455 GNF***
**Kraken** (free SEPA deposit - 0.35% fee)
- 104.99/298.9*0.9965 = 0.3500252091 BTC
**BitRefill - MTN**
- According to the site [0.1242 BTC = 286,400 GNF](
- 0.3500252091/0.1242*286400 = 807,143 GNF
- Withdrawal fee between 500,001 and 1,000,000 = 20,000 GNF (see [here](
- 807,143-20,000 = ***787,143 GNF***
**BitRefill - Orange**
- According to the site [0.1015 BTC = 286,400 GNF](
- 0.3500252091/0.1015*286400 = 987,657 GNF
- Withdrawal fee between 500,001 and 1,000,000 = 20,000 GNF + 1,000 GNF(see [here](
- 987,657-21,000 = ***966,657 GNF***
Seems to be 15% cheaper by using Bitcoin (SEPA &gt; Kraken &gt; BitRefill &gt; Orange &gt; Agent for cash) compared to WorldRemit (and I guess 17% compared to WesternUnion.) Looks very impressive. I am not sure how many "Orange Agents" there are nearby his family though, but definitely worth checking out for him :)
edit: according to these calculations you get a better price than XE aka "the real GNF exchange rate". So make sure to test it first and see if it all works out.
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:04:29
This is incorrect.
SEPA = most of Europe (including Germany) and Bitstamp has a 0.90€ withdrawal fee. It is free to deposit.
International wire withdrawal comes with a minimum $15 fee and probably big fees from your own bank to deposit.

I made a comparison the other day with Android phones. There have been Android phones for the same price for a long time. As much as I like to think this phone w/ Firefox OS will help BTC adoption in those countries, I doubt it will change much.
- [Intex Cloud FX]( w/ Firefox - Rs 1999 = 33 USD
- [Cheers Smart Mobile Phone]( w/ Android - Rs 1949 = 32 USD
- [Forme P9]( w/ Android - Rs 2075 = 34 USD
I am not sure if they are planning to release it in the **Philippines**, but local brand Cherry Mobile (basically brands Chinese phones):
- Cheapest with Android(!): 1499 PHP = 34 USD ([source](
- Cheapest touchscreen phone with internet (OS unknown): 999 PHP = 23 USD ([source](
International brands like Samsung are more expensive here than in USA/EU (in my experience.) But there are a lot of local brands which offer phones with pretty good specifications for a lot less.

Although most people only think about the many Filipinos working overseas, even nationally you can see many people from the whole country (even the smallest villages) go work in Manila since most jobs are there. Probably because of that, the Philippines has several companies focusing on sending money nationally (from Manila to their families in the smaller villages.) These companies are: Cebuana Lhuillier, M Lhuillier, Palawan Express and LBC. You can see branches of these companies (also called "pawnshops") all over the Philippines even in the smaller villages. Rebit (and other BTC PH remittance services) can also send money to these pawnshops for people to pickup their cash. Obviously the fees are slightly higher than to a bank though.
TL;DR: that is possible already with the current "cash pickup" infrastructure.

The payment system iDeal:
1. connected with all major Dutch banks
2. instant
3. the customer cannot charge-back
4. flat fee of like 0.5 EUR or less (for the merchant)
Pretty decent online banking system.
USA simply doesn't have that AFAIK. Pretty sure credit card usage in NL is very low, while that seems the common way in USA. Obvious problems with that is the charging back risk and percentage fee.

Well PHP did make some security mistakes along the way, like register_globals was not the best idea ever :p Also the basics of PHP are so easy that many "PHP programmers" are actually terrible and make really insecure sites (but you cannot really blame PHP for that I guess.)

I see a remittance future of a lot of different companies offering to buy BTC in countries with overseas workers and family on the one side, and companies to sell BTC "back home". BTC will be just the underlying protocol to easily send money between the companies.
Bitcoin ATMs will be great for that, and ideally in the future they would be directly connected to the companies selling BTC through APIs, so the customers would never even have to deal with bitcoin or these strange looking addresses.
Currently we are in very beginning of this. The number of people buying BTC for that purpose through ATMs are extremely low if not 0. But just imagine 0.1% of the remittance market sending money home instantly with these "bitcoin ATMs". 0.1% is 436 million USD yearly. I can guarantee you that many ATM operators will lower their fees by A LOT if they can get that volume (if not: competition will.) Volume and competition will lower the fees.

We trust them because they have been around since 2011 without any major problems/accusations.
But yes, trust-less or even just "provably fair" would be ideal, but still work in progress. For example "Bitfrog" is working on something like that: 
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:14:04
Yes: 
If you click on "30m" each bar represents 30 minutes of time and you can see how massive the volume of the last few hours is. If you make it "1d" you can see how much it is in total today (28.000 btc and counting.) Yesterday it was around ~1.500.
You can also see the volume was ~21.000 on August 18. However that day there was a flash crash from $500 to $309 so big price changes and therefor a lot of trades/volume.
Now the price barely changes and you see (in the right top) that there are buy AND sell orders at exactly the same price for about 30 BTC - over and over again. So like others said, this means there is a bot selling/buying at the same price and basically giving away 0.2% fees to the BTC-E owners for many hours and therefor losing A LOT of money.

I actually didn't post this here, but good to see it gets some attention. I will emphasize why this is important:
In the wild west of bitcoin gambling, I think "self regulation" is really a thing and math/tools/instant withdrawals/etc a good alternative vs gambling licenses. [Provably fair mechanism]( is the prime example, perfect tool to ensure players are not being cheated. For investors this "public cold address" is one of the few things to help them not being scammed as it at least shows solvency (still not enough - but something!) ALL dice sites with investments publish such address, except for new site DaDice.
The fact that DaDice (2mo old) claims to have 542 coins, accepts investments from players, promised to publish such address and given 5 bad excuses for not having such address - is really concerning. And now they will not have this address at all with a silly excuse. I have given better detailed arguments on the forum for those interested.
Basically to me it is a clear scam in the making. They do put some serious work in the development and some bitcoins for "marketing" (signatures on bitcointalk etc.) So the potential scam is really huge (last big dice invest scam was dice.ninja for ~2k BTC.) I just don't want that to happen again and this is at least a clear reason not to trust them.

Yes, depositing EUR/USD through a bank to a Bitcoin exchange, then sending that to a Bitcoin remittance service like BitPesa is not very easy yet. Also the deposit takes a few days, while WU accepts CC so it is instant (BitPesa does send the money after a few minutes btw.)
Actually according to some researches many foreign workers are not doing remittance through the internet at all, but through physical (WU) agents ^(()^[source]( ^(- but probably outdated/incomplete research)^)
But Bitcoin remittance is just starting.
What if.. Bitcoin ATMs can somehow connect to remittance services and people can just put in cash in the country they work in, and easily send it to their families which receive it in minutes ^([1]) Sure, they both might not really use Bitcoin themselves, but it would just the underlying technology for a cheaper way of sending money. Sounds cool to me!
^(1. Currently this would be possible if you have a QR of the deposit address from the remittance service I guess - but still not "that" easy. Also there will be Bitcoin ATM fees, but must be still cheaper for small amounts.)

First of all love my Trezor, but fair point it might be too expensive for some.
I am wondering if truly 2FA wallet exist already? I am not talking about that Google auth code stuff. But a website (with client-side keys obv) or PC client + mobile app with 2-of-2 multi-signature wallet AND with easy usability. So the user doesn't even need to know it's multi-signature, just when he makes transaction on PC, he will get auto-notification on mobile to confirm the transaction. This should increase the security for the average person significantly (needs 2 hacked devices to lose money.) In theory this could let you put a limit on "1 device only change" so you could have 0.1 BTC or whatever on your "mobile-only wallet" for easy spending money w/o PC access, etc. Should this be possible or am I missing something?
I know Ledger is offering something similar, but seems to me this method should work w/o buying USB thing too.

Well you shouldn't trust third-party systems like Coinbase either (MtGox etc.) Although for accepting Bitcoin I think it could be just fine, if you withdraw often. And I do agree that the security of the average server/(PHP) webshop is not that good.
Anyway, I think this is possible:
A system like that could give you easy instructions to make ~~10.000 bitcoin addresses with Armory~~ *1 master public key (which can be used to generate many Bitcoin addresses)* on a secure/cold system. Then export only the ~~Bitcoin addresses~~ *master public key* (without private key) and import it, so it can be used on your webshop/site. Private keys will never be on your server and you will be running bitcoind or whatever to monitor incoming transactions to those Bitcoin addresses.
I do think the average webshop on a shared hosting environment should just use an API like Blockchain, BitPay, CoinBase, etc. But if an easy library like that exists it would be easier for those who do have a VPS/dedi.
~~edit~~: as others stated, you don't even need to generate x num of addresses, just use 1 master public key which will be used to generate many future Bitcoin addresses on the site. [More on Deterministic Wallets](

I thought betting sites were already provably fair since they are betting on public events - especially with sports there is clear proof who won - so it is provably fair? (Player can prove that the bet result is correct and is not being cheated.)
But this is probably the only sports betting exchange "on-chain", so I guess it is more transparent, secure and indeed provable on blockchain that a bet has been placed.


I am not an expert in sports betting, but isn't it very unlikely an exact match in odds is found? I think a listing of all open bets (that players can "accept") would be better, especially to start with. GL.

There are at least 4 bitcoin exchange sites in India, I made some overview today:  (also incomplete, but more complete than rebittance.) They don't seem to market themselves as "remittance" or "sending money home", etc though. Just bitcoin exchanges generally.
@_date: 2015-01-19 09:42:34
Yes, I guess remittance consists of 3 parts: giving your currency (buying BTC), sending it internationally (sending BTC), receive other currency (sell BTC). Obviously that list was only meant to list that last part "receiving other currency" aka selling bitcoin in those countries.
What I meant with "focus on remittance" is that some sites like  specifically designed their website for 1 purpose "sending pesos with bitcoin to someone in PH". They really market their site for remittance usage, for example by comparing it to traditional remittance services. This is different from the average exchange like OKCoin, so Rebit is "specifically focused on remittance".
Better yet: Rebit has the option to make you login with your Coinbase account so you buy+send bitcoin "instantly" which perhaps is the full "remittance process" in once.
EDIT: oh and I know some will think "bitcoin is ideal for remittance because people can just use the bitcoin to buy their rice" and stuff. But I think that's not (yet) realistic. In the future that might change :)

Well, I am not entirely sure if that 10:04 is really GMT time (server header does say GMT, but not sure if it works like that.) There is also no guarantee that this time really represents the time from when that file was accessible for public. But you are correct, those news sites were several hours late.
Actually the first mention on reddit seems to be [16:26 GMT]( (somehow first in other sub :x) - before the news sites and with the SEC PDF as source. So it is possible that this really is the first source.
Then again, last time the delay was very very obvious and relatively small news. This time there are probably more people actively watching/following that news.

If you want a budget hardware wallet, Ledger is probably fine. But let's be honest. Trezor is the best hardware wallet.

XAU is one troy ounce of gold, currently 1 XAU = $1,205.90. Theymos uses this for normal bug bounties too: "*I prefer not to denominate values in any single country's currency here, but BTC is too unstable. XAU is pretty stable.*".
So 15 XAU = 18,088.5 USD = ~75.5 BTC.

That was interesting, yeh :p
Basically the CEO (a white guy) said "*Bitcoin is too difficult for mainstream*" in an interview that was about Bitcoin in the Philippines. So some Filipinos accused him of calling Filipinos stupid (obviously it was about "mainstream" globally.) Then the CEO just got upset, made some comments (also about the moderators that "should have reacted differently") and eventually left the group.
IDK. He should have reacted differently, but I think the company is still trustworthy. I would personally still use coins.ph if it's the cheapest (I compare prices every time before transaction.)

Although I am happy with my Trezor and have trust-issues, I am happy to see more and more competition :) Hardware wallets are really THE way of holding bitcoins safely while still being able to easily spend it. I wouldn't trust my mother/etc with bitcoin unless it's with a secure hardware wallet. Good job.
Hope to here expert's opinion about the safety of it, especially when running the actual Trezor firmware (any risks in the hardware?)
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:01:33
Nope, Trezor gets power from USB only.
I prefer Trezor because of the screen: 1) it shows recovery seed only on that screen (compromised computer on first install can steal all bitcoins of ledger) and 2) that security card can be cracked by advanced malware after few transactions.
That being said, I know ledger keeps improving and they are planning to have mobile 2FA instead of security card very soon (so would need compromised pc+phone) and in the future even a new device with screen.
In the end, competition is definitely always good (for cheaper prices too) and hardware wallets are really great :)
But again: currently for 1 BTC I would not recommend it. It's nice to know about the options though.

You can buy (and sell) Bitcoin for PHP at several companies:
**Buying / selling BTC**
* BuyBitcoin -  (buy/sell BTC)
* Coins.ph -  (buy/sell BTC) -  (sell BTC) -  (buy load with BTC)
* Palarin - beta -  (buy/sell BTC)
* SCI -  (sell BTC) -  (buy BTC) -  (pay bills with BTC)
**Exchanges (more difficult, less bank options, etc)**
* Btcexchange - 
* SCI - 
**Compare prices**

There are several **stores / restaurants** already in PH that accept BTC, you can see some here:

Some quick hints: you could use tools like  and  The address he sent it to is [3QGG9NTVj5dZKcoqAtAiTGpxtqGW3ZaAmK]( this is part of a huge wallet [000123a848]( I am not sure if this is an exchange or mixer, but should be something like that (and that makes the transactions after that fairly unlinked/irrelevant.) AFAIK you can do 2 things:
- Figure out from which site that wallet is. If it is a legitimate exchange, you might get some information when you make a police report and the police is willing to contact that exchange.
- If that 3QGG9.. is his deposit address of that exchange/site, then the other smaller transactions TO that address are interesting. He *might* be in control of the input (and change) addresses of those transactions. One of those former transactions *might* be linked with his online identity. Search, click, search, etc.. not much more you can do I am afraid.
Good luck. Truthfully there is only a real small chance you will get your bitcoins back, but above things are worth a try IMO.

Thank you for sharing some insights from some Chinese bitcoiners/miners. My personal opinion as a Core supporter:
IMO there is no way that the blocks will stay 1MB. Most Core developers have shown plans (but not always concrete plans) and some even proposals to increase the blocksize (although some might be too conservative for others.)
**More importantly**, the community (users and businesses), also need/want bitcoin to grow. If Core will take a stance "1MB forever" after SW, I am 100% sure that most of the community will support an alternative proposal/implementation (not risky gamble BU/EC but a safe alternative blocksize increase.) Again: I do think Core developers will look into good solutions too though and do not want "1MB forever".
Lightning seems very cool, but it will be experimental and only for small payments. We cannot fully predict that most transactions will move to there.
IMO the most rational thing to do is: activate SW as "quick" safe soft-fork  (needs only some weeks if miners support it.) Analyze how the effective 1.85MB blocksize increase affects the network after some weeks/months (less/more nodes, transaction/block propagation, how many transactions, etc.) See if Lightning (and other L2 tech) works practical and will really help for micro/small payments (and what effects it has on the blockchain/transactions.) Partly based on that data, make a dynamic blocksize increase with a safe HF (long activation time, high signaling requirements, etc.)
In theory the ideal blocksize would be the biggest blocksize possible that doesn't negatively affect full nodes (and miners) as technology advances (both hardware and software.) But it is and will be still difficult to agree on what those exact parameters will be, so I don't expect that the discussion will stop after SW (and it is definitely not a "last chance" for miners to show their preference.) But I do hope more people will realize that proposals like EC are just reckless, will never get majority support from the community and will be guaranteed to cause an undesirable split. IMO the longer some miners continue to support that reckless proposal (and effectively block SW/LN increase/innovation), the more toxic the community gets and the more difficult future discussions will be. Better just work together on finding good and safe future solutions.
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:00:54
Sorry, but this is a pretty strange poll. Segwit can be easily activated as safe softfork, making blocks effectively 2.1 MB and allowing second layer innovation (I am sure you know this.) Doing another "quick bump" after (or together with) that as a risky HF, just seems like a waste.
IMO, after Segwit, the obvious answer will be to have a proper dynamically increasing blocksize. So the ideal answer is: **Segwit + plans for a safe dynamic HF** (not EC - EC is just a joke.) From my perspective, more and more users/developers/businesses agree with this. Of course I don't expect that dynamic blocksize to be activated by end of 2017 already, but would be nice to actively compare options by that time and see if Segwit activation already show some data.
But yeh, for now we are stuck because of Ver&amp;Wu.
edit: additionally some users still don't understand Segwit is a blocksize increase. So IMO to be clear you should say "*with SegWit (effectively 2.1 MB if fully used.)*" and 4.2 MB and 16.8 MB (lol?) for the other 2 options.
@_date: 2017-03-23 04:17:17
The costs of increasing the blocksize is not just on the miners. It also highly affect the full nodes. We all have to store all the transactions forever on our nodes. If miners decide to increase the blocksize to 10MB, many would not be able to run nodes anymore. (Note this isn't as simple as downloading 10MB every 10 minutes, some have 100 connections with their node, meaning they would have to *upload* it to so many connections too - costs both a lot of bandwidth and storage.) The decentralization nature of bitcoin, is what makes it great. If we only had 100 nodes in some big datacenters, it would be rather easy for governments to implement KYC policies on the nodes, black/white-listing inputs (censorship), etc. The more economic full nodes, the better.
In theory we should of course allow the blocksize to increase as technology advances. I just think the best way to agree on that is to have several blocksize proposals that explicitly state how much it will increase in which timeframe, then have developers/users/businesses show their preference and try to get consensus. Giving all the power to the miners seems stupid to me.
Obviously it make sense to do this after Segwit. Since Segwit also increases the blocksize (as safe softfork, so no people will be forked of the network), we will even have real data on how the nodes react to a blocksize increase.
PS, these aren't all the risks and I still plan to write an article on why I believe "emergent consensus" is so terrible in more detail.

Realistically those who are interested in privacy/smart-contract sidechains, will probably actually go to alt coins right now. So I could use your argument too and say it would actually attract more developers to bitcoin :p Although overall, I still don't think it's too relevant TBH.
Overall Segwit, which is effectively 2.1MB, still seems like the best first step to me. It had a testnet since 2015 with a lot of people reviewing it and seems very secure to me. After that I definitely want to see a dynamic blocksize increase by HF too.

Emergent consensus is a broken concept and easily the most stupid unsafe way to increase the blocksize. It actually just means "*5 mining pool operators dictate the rules and nodes better be lucky enough to be on their fork*". Miners should not be in *full* control of the blocksize, as the costs are also on the full nodes. It makes the security of 1 - 11 confirmations much less secure, as a tiny tiny miner can double spend those confirmed transactions easily. It removes the most crucial part of the bitcoin network, the "consensus" part where we all agree on the rules of the network, and replaces it with an untested gambling method where every user constantly have to worry if he is on the right or wrong fork. 
I have respect for big blockers who want a safely-planned dynamic blocksize HF (and I also want that - just like most Core developers/supporters), but "emergent consensus" is just unacceptable.

*This is what is happening right now*.
BU gives miners full power over the blocksize, while an increasing blocksize is mostly a cost for full nodes. Meanwhile miners are using it as a tool to block second layer innovation too. That is indeed pretty damn too outrageous! Not even talking about all the bugs and idiotic assumptions in the emergent consensus concept.
This is why the economic majority controls the network by running full nodes. You are correct, miners can change the block reward right now too - but will be rejected by the rest of the network. Miners can also try to activate the software that gives them full power over the blocksize - but it will be rejected by the rest of the network.

Ah okay, didn't realize it would show "open bets", nice :)
I understood what you meant with provably on blockchain and I agree provably fair by betting on blockchain is the best kind of provably fair.
Still in the dice community the whole "server- and client-seed" provably fair method on "off-chain" dice sites - is still considered provably fair. By far most volume is on those sites. But yes, that is mostly to prove for yourself you haven't been cheated, still you must convince others that the site cheated you. I guess that is the same with off-chain betting exchanges - so it is definitely still considered provably fair though, at least with dice provably fair standards :p But I agree on-chain betting, like your site, is the best for a provably fair method.

They are working on [Lumino]( which would be a LN-like protocol on top of RSK (it could work on top of bitcoin but it would require an extra soft fork.) To me Lumino doesn't seem as much as developed as Lightning though (paper is just 1 month old.)
I personally do like the idea of RSK (and potentially Lumino), just as I like LN. So at this point I would like to assume it can work complementary to each other and best to just consider all possible second layer innovation.

We all use bitcoin on **mainnet**.
Then for testing purposes there is a public **testnet**. That works somewhat the same as mainnet in the sense that you have some tiny miners mining testnet coin (that are worthless though.)
Since you still need to wait for blocks on testnet, there is another test method called **regtest**. The advantage is that you as developer can just create blocks very quickly (which is what he is doing when he says he needs 3 confirmations etc.) So this video is a proof of example on regtest. It could work on testnet too though since it has Segwit enabled already. After opening the channel, the transactions in between the 3 LN nodes are indeed off-chain "second layer" transactions.
TL;DR yes, successful LN transaction off-chain on bitcoin's regtest.

A safe HF will need a long activation time to ensure everyone is upgraded. Segwit is effectively a blocksize increase to 2.1MB (if used.) Most nodes are already ready for it, just needs some miners to activate it. Old nodes will continue to work just fine too, so it is more safe than a HF. Besides, Segwit will make second layers like LN possible.
Doing a small blocksize increase by HF does not make any rational sense at this point (it will take at least 6 months and will very likely still be contentious resulting into 2 chains.) Segwit and working on a longer-term on-chain dynamic blocksize HF makes more sense.

A HF will always require all wallets to upgrade, that's why Segwit as softfork is preferred as first initial bump instead. Most wallets already adjusted their software to use the new Segwit transactions:  it's basically just up to the miners to activate it now.

12 or 24 words is all that it takes to recover your coins from your hardware wallet. You just need to make sure that this backup is in a safe environment (also in case of fire that destroys both your HW and backup.) For solid backup you can actually also use [cryptosteel]( too.
The advantage of a hardware wallet over cold paper wallets is not just ease-of-setup, but also that you can easily spend the money. You can indeed connect the wallet to your phone (USB) and pay things by QR etc.

Segwit effectively makes the blocksize 2.1 MB. That *is* an on-chain blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:54:41
I don't think it will result into that. The "core" level of Bitcoin will be still much more important, can use plenty of improvements and will have enough people working on it. Most of the money will still transact on this level IMO.
Meanwhile if it make sense for some use-cases to use off-chain (but decentralized) solutions, it would be only good. Like privacy or smart-contract sidechains, cannot really work on the "core level", so why not "allow" it as second layer? Micro-transactions are realistically not viable on the "core level" so why not "allow" the start of that usage? I don't think it will really stop developers from learning about the "core level" though.

Nice, added :)
@_date: 2017-03-23 03:51:47
SW is not a long-term on-chain scaling solution. It gives a safe way to get 2.1 MB now (based on current transactions), allow decentralized second layer solutions like the LN and in the meantime we can work on a safely planned dynamically increasing blocksize by HF. Not the insane gamble BU's "emergent consensus" that gives miners full power over the blocksize and risks users being on the wrong fork.

What are you saying exactly?
We could have Segwit very easily activated if the whole "anti-core" propaganda would stop already. Segwit makes the blocksize effectively 2.1 MB (based on latest analysis) which allows more on-chain transactions. Meanwhile it will open the door for decentralized second layers which obviously will still take some years to become a really smooth/good experience. Additionally it is fairly obvious that the new blocksize limit will still not be good enough for all on-chain transactions in the future, so we can work for safe properly-planned blocksize increase as HF during that time too.
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:38:09
Blockstream is not running anything. Troll.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:12:56
Hi Jihan Wu. Segwit and second layers will only improve bitcoin giving it more value. A higher price should benefit miners as well. Segwit will effectively make the blocksize 2.1 MB too based on latest research, allowing more transactions in the blocks (potentially) allowing miners to earn more. Even after that, practically no one thinks we should keep the small blocksize "forever". Just activate Segwit already, let the different innovative teams work on cool decentralized second layer solutions that will probably improve bitcoin and start the discussions for a realistic safe properly-planned dynamic blocksize increase ("emergent consensus" is obviously not a real option.) Very easy way to go 土大木. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:20:46
That would depend on which wallet it is. Technically Bitcoin Core (or BU) is also a wallet, which obviously does need to be upgraded on a HF. Technically Coinbase is also a wallet, but only the backend (that Coinbase controls) would need to be upgraded.
For most SPV wallets I assume a contentious HF like BU will be only confusing though. They will connect to full nodes and potentially get different results (as there would be a blockchain split.) How each SPV wallet handles it, really depends on their software but I highly doubt they are properly prepared for it.
A non-contentious HF, that hopefully could be done in the future, should work fine for most SPV wallets (and it doesn't matter if Segwit is enabled or not.) I guess you were talking about this.
Note: wallets do NOT need to be upgraded for Segwit. You can continue to use your non-Segwit wallet just fine if Segwit is enabled. Only to directly use the advantage of Segwit (smaller transaction = smaller fee), you would need to upgrade. Especially hardware wallets are [very excited]( about Segwit because it makes HW much faster.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:31:43
It seems to be based on BitFury's research to me, but I agree there should be some clear calculations. Johoe's research show it would be more like 1.85MB, so I guess you were indeed correct.

Yes, especially the middle 4 projects are very active. There are still other people working on it too, like this dev had a [preview of a more simple LN wallet]( (on top of 'lnd'.)
Very exciting indeed. Of course I have many "skeptical questions" like everyone else, but it looks all very cool and is work in progress. I plan to just play a bit with it on regtest/testnet soon too :)

From 
133 MB blocks could do 2 settlements a year for 7 billion people and allow them to do "unlimited" transactions through the second layer LN. (7e9 * 2 txs * 500Byte / 52560blocks/yr)
However, it is important to realize this would be a very futuristic view where *everyone* is using bitcoin and LN would work perfectly. I say this, because people like to spin it to "*Core only allows 2 TXs a year!*" which would obviously be a lie.

No one should use bitcoin (on the first layer) to buy coffee. Blocks take 10 mins on average but every other day a block takes 1 hour because of variance (even if blocks would be empty.) Why would you wait 1 hour to get your coffee?
That is exactly why we need second layers like LN. Not just for the fees on micro-transactions, but also for *instant* transactions. Check the other topic the other day for some LN dev progress:  I am still skeptical too, but for small transactions it looks pretty cool.
The only reason why Segwit isn't enabled yet, is because the miners (effectively just a few people!) want BU as that gives full power of the blocksize to the miners (even though it's mostly a cost for full nodes) and delays cool second layer innovation like LN.

I keep spamming this, but just sharing information :) There are 6 separate implementations of the [LN protocol](
* [Amiko-Pay](
* [**Eclair**]( (ACINQ)
* [**lightningd**]( (Blockstream)
* [**lit**]( (MIT Digital Currency Initiative)
* [**lnd**]( (Lightning Co) - extra projects on top of 'lnd': [Colu]( [lncli-web]( [lnd-gui](
* [Thunder]( (Blockchain.info)
The middle 4 projects are most active and working on implementing the same [BOLT standard]( so they will be fully compatible with each other. You can test them with Bitcoin's regtest and some do work on testnet (with Segwit-enabled) already.
If Segwit would be enabled on mainnet in a few months, I am very confident you *could* already run LN on mainnet **right away**. Does that mean it will be really used already? Obviously not. Routing might be still not perfect, GUI looks confusing for non-techs, "cheating outsourcing" might be not ready (in case you don't have full node), there will be probably no "lite LN nodes" yet (that don't require full BTC node), probably no sites that accept it, etc. But the LN development is way more active than some people seem to think and could be very nice (and somewhat popular) for instant small/micro transactions in like 1 or 2 years (my guess!)

I once started on a site like this locally, also close to 1k stores, but I had a lot of stores that accepted BTC through Mollie and then Mollie dropped BTC support - lol. One of the risk of centralized payment providers :( So I never continued it, but my feedback based that:
- You can easily add Alexa rating to each domain:  this way you can sort the stores by Alexa rating. This is not 100% perfect, but a very good way to get an indication of more popular sites in an automated way. People will more easily recognize the top listed stores making your list better IMO (while still being objective compared to subjective votes or paid listings.)
- A shop in EU is typically not interesting for someone from US. So by minimum you could add country of store (first automatic on domain extension - but probably some manual work for .com) Then perhaps some continent/country filter. Of course long-term actual "shipping countries" is interesting, but a lot of manual work.
- Here are 30 sites not listed on your site. I assume you got some "crawler" to add this faster than the manual input (since I can see some meta descriptions in there.) A lot of these do look pretty bad, so up to you which ones to add.
- BTW there is also a bug with search, just try to search on "surfair".. returns many double entries.
Overall your vision sounds great (especially compared to most of these store overview sites), so good luck.

What I did was following in Bitcoin Core:
    command: importprivkey "privatekeyhere"
    returns: 1PoQHTrjyrX4TKanTAqZW3zjR78ge5G1Hv
    command: addwitnessaddress "1PoQHTrjyrX4TKanTAqZW3zjR78ge5G1Hv"
    returns: 3AP49vEiPxZaWQz7qJUsm5KBmhCarRAfZc
So you generated the correct 1PoQHT... address, but then you had to make a segwit P2SH address from it. Then OP sent it from 3AP49vEiPxZa... to bc1qlgv4vls34m... So my guess is that bc1qlgv4vls34m... is Bech32 address from that private key, but to be honest I am not sure.
Anyway, I was able to spend the money in Bitcoin Core and I sent it all the "thewaterproject". So you cannot claim it anymore :p

Bitcore requires much more data than a normal node because it indexes all address/transactions. This way you can easily retrieve information about a specific address/transaction and run your own block explorer (Bitcore's Insight) or wallet service. I don't run Bitcore, but I assume it's 200 GB already right now.
Additionally it requires more CPU and RAM too, so I highly doubt a Pi3 will be sufficient. Obviously $1k isn't necessary either though.

If you got the 24 words, you could brute force the 25th word. Although it might take some time (needs to generate some address(es) and check if it was ever used.) It would be cool if someone did the math.

TBH segwit in Core isn't really good for wallet yet (on purpose.) You will have to manually generate a segwit address in the bitcoin console. Good segwit wallet support is planned for 0.15.1 (because 0.15.0 is already a RC and features frozen.)

Just luck/variance.
[BTCC stats]( show same amount of hashrate (~7.x%) while they found ~13% in last 24h (so at least +6% is from BTCC's luck.) Potentially Bitfury got some extra hashrate (+3%), but I still assume that's just variance too.

Fees have nothing to do with the TX value, just the number of bytes. Currently there is [only 200 kb]( above 80 sat/byte in "the mempool", so if you use that, it will be ~**$0.78 for median TX** to have it confirmed in **the next block**. I just sent a TX with that fee and it got confirmed in minutes. Since BCH miners are back mining BTC and with the lower TXs in the weekend, a lower fee ^[1] would probably confirm in some hours too. Stop paying miners too much. Ideally smarter fee estimation and RBF could help.
Segwit adoption takes time, this has been known forever and will eventually give us around 1.9x of transaction throughput based on current transactions. Segwit essentially has been activated for like 2 business days, so it is a bit silly to expect every business/user to use segwit already. Let's see how much % uses SW after 1 or some months :)
[1] There is less than 9MB to 30 sat/byte (~ $0.30 for median TX), I find it very likely that these TXs will be confirmed on this Sunday. Ideally use RBF, just in case you do need to bump it.

Of course it can be bruteforced, you start with passphrase "a", generate the private/public keys with those 25 words and see if it was ever used. Next passphrase "b", etc. Obviously this takes more time than bruteforcing some MD5 hash though, which is why I said it's cool if someone did the math.
jcoinner's estimation looks good, so with a long secure passphrase, it would basically take really long.

Sorry but downvoted. It would be only relevant if a new pool would signal Segwit or if it's proven that one of the pools that already signals Segwit significantly increased their hashrate (let's hope so.)
But this seems to be just short-term variance. It's just as relevant as saying "*67% in last 3 blocks*" :X
edit: [BTCC]( shows they have a 7.7% share **at this moment** (which is also exactly the percentage of blocks they found in the [last 7 days]( However in the [last 24h]( they found 13.91% of the blocks so they have been lucky.

If you don't need to send payments, it really is better to use addresses that cannot be spend on the server. I don't think there is a clear guide, but an example:
- Use Trezor to hold private keys, get xpub from an account.
- Loop xpub to get the addresses and use [importaddress RPC]( to add it to the node.
- Either use "walletnotify" or loop [listtransactions RPC]( (have to put "include watch parameter"), to check for new transactions.
- Use regtest to simulate more complex situations like orphans and make solutions based on your requirements (how many confirmations etc.)
The reason why I would love to see a professional guide for this too, is to actually see how most sites handle orphans (TBH I think most sites do not do this properly.) But this might give you some idea.
 Using locked wallet
Potentially, instead of using "watch only" addresses, perhaps you could encrypt your wallet locally and use the encrypted version on your server. It still seems like a security risk to me and I am not sure if this can generate new addresses with "[getnewaddress]( but might be possible if you really want it.

I know generating SW addresses is fairly easy by just adding "addwitnessaddress" after the regular "getnewaddress". So that is possible for deposit addresses.
But by default "sendtoaddress" (for withdrawals) will use a non-SW change addresses (as you might know since you made this topic??) - which is why I asked when they expect that new version. Alternatively you could use raw transactions to use your own made SW change address, but not every service uses this.

Services are obviously at risk. For example a gambling site.. deposit with money which is only on "old chain" and after they credit the balance, withdraw it all (transaction will work on both chains since their private keys indeed work on both chains.) Easy money.
"*But of course they will upgrade*" is a pretty big assumption. If we *all* agree to do a HF, wait for a big threshold of hashrate (and nodes?), activate after a year - then yes, I personally think it will be fine. Actually I hope we can do something like that in 2017 to make an extra bump in '18-'19. But activating Segwit first, after it's being developed, reviewed/tested and adopted by other developers/wallets/services/etc - seems pretty obvious to me.
@_date: 2016-11-13 04:56:59
Kraken should be even cheaper (and free SEPA too.) Depends on what $ / € price each exchange is though.
But overall, I personally always recommend Kraken for users who can do SEPA transfers.
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:38:51
Do you have any estimation of how long it will take after SW is activated?
I mostly ask because I know there are plenty of services (that do a lot of TXs) who would be happy to use segwit but are using the simple sendtoaddress RPC commands (and probably prefer to wait for that version rather than switching to raw TXs.) Thanks.
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:59:35
So to calculate some totals: BTCC (11%) + Slush (4%) + BitClub (4%) + BitFury (8%) + Unknown (1%) = **28 % of total hashrate** (based on [1M stats](
The "unknown miner" is mining 750kb blocks with ckpool, signaling Segwit and using same [bitcoin address]( since end of October (so we can calculate 30/3850 = 0.8% of total blocks since that time.)
Obviously in the end only [blocks]( are relevant, but interesting to estimate/follow IMO.
@_date: 2016-11-25 14:59:07
Lol. Wallets/services/exchanges don't have to lift a finger @ HF? Sure, if they want to lose money by being on the "wrong" fork. That's exactly the risk.
But yes, Segwit does add some work, but a lot of developers are making the effort to adjust their wallets/services/etc:  So seems pretty silly to *not* support Segwit now after (almost the whole) community put effort into it.

BTW: ~~ViaBTC hashrate is down from 120P to [100P since a few hours]( (= estimated 5%.) I have not seen their hashrate this low yet. Must be the damn water problems.~~ ViaBTC back to 120P.

24 - 48h timespan is just variance. It was ~170P, then 2.5 weeks ago to ~120P, after that it was actually back to ~145P and now back to 122P [according to their site]( But total hashrate is always increasing (+10% this month), so even if they maintain 120P, their hashrate share will become lower.
Based on the [current total hashrate]( that is around 122.288/1992.735\*100 = **6.1% of total hashrate**.

Meh, most of them started signalling 8 MB after "*Core developer Gavin said we should raise the blocksize to 20 MB*" (a while ago.) So it was indeed a conservative reaction to the western world. Right now, it seems like only BW Pool (10%) is still putting that in their coinbase text.
That being said, I personally have no idea what Chinese miners want.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:25:41
It is a mixed of things:
* Some empty blocks are right after another block. This is fair enough and what most miners do (no time to check TXs in previous block etc.)
* Some blocks have segwit transactions.
* Some blocks are just "normal full blocks".
* Some blocks are limited to &lt;700 KB which doesn't make sense.
* Some blocks are even empty even when it was 20+ minutes ago when the last block has been. Definitely doesn't make sense.
I don't think it is really enough to call a pattern. It is likely that these are mined on different servers with different "rules".
One could guess selectively using asicboost and/or trying to make the mempool higher so it can be used as propaganda for bcash. Overall not sure at this moment.

If you look at the first TX, there are 3 inputs:
- [1Pbia3LJxMWYRSWXx3o7E84jG8tCdTfX3T]( (confirmed)
- [1J3d4i9qjM7RPfVeS6DP5ERJXwfWQe26EH]( (unconfirmed)
- [1BqDVXLdtNEE7GYhMjLQERzBPEXjkt6VLW]( (unconfirmed)
So as you can see, the transactions from 2 out of 3 inputs are not confirmed. Therefor your transaction cannot confirm either. Specifics really depend on who sent you those last 2 TXs. Same for other TX.

For the future, if you have a recent version of Electrum, you can go to: "Tools" &gt; "Preferences" &gt; "Enable Replace-By-Fee". This preference enables a "Replaceable" checkbox on sending so you can increase the fee of future transactions.
Although the "*Within 2 blocks*" fee should be enough normally too (but you might have been unlucky.)
PS, your TX will be "removed" from the network (well most mempools) after 72h of no confirmations. However, I assume it will get confirmed before that if the TX fee was somewhat normal.

Mm, well I like your site and think it's cool :) But I dislike how some people here see bitcoin gambling, including your reply here.
Gambling sites have switched to off-chain gambling for years. There are only few sites (luckybit, directbet) left doing on-chain gambling, the majority (too many to name) are doing off-chain gambling. Just to emphasize: even luckybit only did around 100 bets a day last few days, the off-chain sites process tens of millions of bets every day.
Deposits and withdrawals to gambling sites is IMO a much better use-case for bitcoin than "shopping" normal stuff. People NEED a decentralized unstoppable payment system for gambling as some countries (like the US) decide they don't allow their citizens to decide what kind of entertainment they want with their own money. Meanwhile, shopping and paying your new gadgets with bitcoins is fun, but doesn't *really* need bitcoin.
So IMO the majority of gambling activity (that is off-chain and only uses bitcoin for deposits/withdrawals) is definitely not spam.

People should stop looking at short-term stupid estimations. The actual hashrate for Segwit is around **20%** and if we include BitFury (who has "segwit" in coinbase but not yet proper signal) it's **28%**.
Short-term variance can turn this into **15-25%** (excluding BitFury) but that's pretty meaningless. You can see this very clearly on the [144 blocks line on the graph](
 &gt; So to calculate some totals: BTCC (11%) + Slush (4%) + BitClub (4%) + BitFury (8%) + Unknown (1%) = **28 % of total hashrate** (based on [1M stats](

Some block explorers, most notably blockchain.info, have "*Relayed by IP*" information. They do this by connecting to "a lot" of nodes, currently [831 nodes]( and see which nodes send them a new TX first. Since there are more than 5000 active nodes (much more if includes "non-listening"), this isn't very accurate. They indeed have a way to show all transactions relayed by IP too: 
The best way to hide your IP is to use TOR.

1. R3CEV is a private blockchain that has nothing to do with bitcoin.
2. Segwit != Lightning Network. Segwit will allow larger blocks (= on-chain scaling) and Segwit will also help second layer solutions like Lightning Network.
3. The tweet suggests that Goldman Sachs and Santander actually left the private blockchain R3CEV because bitcoin will be able to handle so many transactions with Lightning Network.
The tweet suggests pretty much the *opposite* of your post. You seem to have no clue what R3CEV, Segwit or Lightning Network is, so I am not sure why you would even make that post.

They are not really looking for "1 SHA256 answer". They are just looking for a target (so hash represents a number and it needs to be smaller than x.) So they will just include highest TX fees (they *can* also choose different TXs - but it just makes sense to earn most) and then keep changing the nonce and coinbase text with random characters to calculate a blockhash that fits the target. If another miner finds a blockhash that *also* meets the target at the same time, there will be an orphan block (basically one of the blocks will be ignored.)

But there are still proposals being made. There are 2 big workshops planned where most bitcoin developers/experts will discuss the issue in much more technical detail. 
Just picking the first working implementation without considering all options first, seems wrong to me. 
Personally I am neutral towards BIP101. I *really* like the way it sounds and I want it to be possible. But if several (core) developers, who are much more knowledgeable about it than me (and those CEOs), say it's very risky.. I am willing to see their proposals first too.

I am glad that you changed some miners from XT to 8MB, but your site still has incorrect, maybe even misleading, data:
- The 8 companies are not voting for "BIP101 XT hard fork", just for "BIP101". Especially BitPay has explicitly said at your own [source]( to support "BIP101 in Core". You should either not include XT at your site at all and just call it "BIP101", or make a separate "BIP101 core" category.
- Slush gives the option for users to vote on BIP101, but currently has only [2.5 PH out of their 24 PH hash rate]( vote for that. Perhaps you can somehow say "~10% of their hash rate" or whatever. Besides, your other [source]( only says something about 8MB blocks, not BIP101.
- I think your source link for Armory is incorrect? Because it links to a person from another company.
- I think your source link for MPEx is incorrect? Because it links to a person from another company.
- It seems like "BIP103 Core" means "No increase". Is that correct? Some consider SIPA's BIP to be BIP103. "No increase" doesn't have a BIP.
- Your source of CoinBase is from May 4, before BIP101 was made and does only agree in general to increase the size. No specific support.
- Your source of OKCoin is from May 13, before BIP101 was made and does only agree in general to increase the size. No specific support.
- Your source of Breadwallet is from May 8, before BIP101 was made and does agree with a one-time 20Mb raise, which is not on the table any more. Not sure what their current position is.
- Your source of BitGo is wrong and outdated, but could be changed to: [this]( since they do support BIP101.
- Your source of Xapo is wrong and outdated, but could be changed to: [this]( since they do support BIP101.
- Your source of blockchain.info is wrong and outdated, but could be changed to: [this]( since they do support BIP101.
- Companies like "Coinwallet" should not be included IMO - but I understand it's difficult to estimate which company is relevant. But AFAIK they do not have much real users and just spam the blockchain.
- Truthfully, I still didn't even check all sources, but this is a start I guess.
A few days ago, I had the impression your site was just made to promote XT, but since you changed most miners already, I guess it's just some misunderstanding. If you just want to make a fair comparison of all the options and the public support for it, then good job and good luck :) I think it would be great if you add "Date" from the source too.

People seem to give examples of the open-source world, like MariaDB that got forked from MySQL. MariaDB works great, nice performance; it truly is improvement by forking. However with bitcoin, the software is not just software, it is also a consensus protocol:
- Bitcoin core fork **without** altering the bitcoin protocol. Should work fine. I am pretty sure you can promote this in this subreddit. Just like MariaDB, if you get a small percentage of users, it will still work great, good luck.
- Bitcoin core fork **with** altering the bitcoin protocol. In this case, your coin will be an altcoin, just like Litecoin was created this way. You cannot have a small percentage of users, change the protocol and still be using "bitcoin". There will be 2 different blockchains (yours perhaps with a historical bitcoin blockchain before the "own blockchain".) So this is a lot different compared to MariaDB where you can still have a small user base.
I think that creating many (different) solutions/proposals, give arguments for them, coding them, testing them, reviewing them and comparing them to get a reasonable consensus that most experts and users can live with; is **much** better than creating different software based on each proposal and try to "win it". It will only create confusion among everyone, drive the community apart and I personally think it would *seriously* hurt bitcoin even if it does survive (technically it would no matter what, but I mean by confidence and value.)

There are at least 13 sponsors and Blockstream is indeed one of them. I am very glad that there are sponsors, because some independent bitcoin developers/researchers might need some travel/hotel money. I do not see the logic how blockstream developers could force their views (whatever that is) on everyone that is attending just because they are 1 of the sponsors. For what it's worth, even the site says "*The intent is for independence and a diversity of views to be represented in a professional manner,* ***some of which may disagree with the views of the sponsors***.".


The first workshop in Sep:


The second workshop in Nov/Dec:


Although I would love to see a concrete solution even this week, just as much as the whole community, I think the scheduled workshops are a very good idea. I do not think there is any reason to rush this important decision. Sure, we need a bigger block size and hopefully in 2016 already, but I highly doubt these 3-4 months extra are going to hurt anything. A few months for testing the several proposals seems like a decent schedule and I like the idea of having the second workshop in China so Chinese miners could attend.
Overall it seems like a good way to reach consensus to me.

Current BIP support from miners. Hash rate based on [1 month stats](
**[BIP 100](
- [F2Pool]( - 19.41%
- ~~[BTCChina Pool]( - 12.04%~~ edit: not anymore
- [BitClub Network]( - 0.88%
- [Kano CKPool]( - 0.61%
Total hash rate supporting BIP 100 is ~~33%~~ **21%**
**[BIP 101](
- [KNCMiner]( - 4.49%
- [Slush]( - [10.5%]( of 3.98% = 0.42%
Total hash rate supporting BIP 101 is **5%**
PS, I think this doesn't mean too much, since existing and new proposals will be still heavily discussed during and after the [workshop]( I hope everyone (services, miners, users, etc) will still be open for any (new) proposals and arguments. But it is kinda interesting to see what the miners and mining-pool owners *currently* think.
PS2,  some miners still vote the original "one-time 8MB increase" before BIPs were made. These are: [AntPool]( - 17.92% (however somehow only less than half their blocks), [BW Pool]( - 7.69%, [21 Inc.]( - 4.19%. Total is a bit difficult to say because AntPool has blocks with and without "vote". Also one-time 8MB increase is no BIP.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:57:37
Lol, you are looking at a block explorer that isn't updated. Have a look at  and see how the blocks are constantly above 1MB. Sure only like 1.05 - 1.2 MB but if the big companies (Coinbase, Bitpay, blockchain.info, other exchanges, etc) actually start to use segwit, this will continue to increase significantly up to around 1.9x indeed.
edit: the few blocks that are still 1MB are unfortunately capped by that miner. Like BW.COM still has to increase their limit :(
@_date: 2015-08-25 17:52:12
No. If I want to vote for BIP 100, I would be voting "Other" too. So "Other" does not represent "No change" only, but also all other block size increase proposals instead of BIP 101.
@_date: 2015-08-26 11:13:57
Nice job :)
Pretty sure Armory had other link before, but seems correct now. However that is also a source from May. Any source from May cannot support or "vote" for BIP 101 because BIP 101 was made after that :p
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:48:21
I understand and agree that you should be looking only at the blockchain blocks. But you and BlockTrail seem to have different qualifications for this. I think these are the differences:
- KnC and 21 have '/BV8000000/', but ~~this is from before BIP100~~ (edit: was used during one-time 8MB increase voting) and should be interpreted as vote for 8MB IMO. Also because BIP100 would only allow 2MB as max atm? In addition [KnC said]( they support BIP101 - but you shouldn't base it on that.
- The other mining pools that I mentioned simply put "/BIP100/ " in their coinbase scriptSig. I understand this is technically incorrect, but since the implementation is not yet there, I think it is a clear vote.
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:11:09
Not really. Slush offers to choose between "BIP 101" and "Other". That's not really much choice at all. But at least they don't force the "BIP 101" vote though.
I agree, in theory it would be nice if all pools offer all options to the miners, yes. Although in the end the pool decides what they support. People can also switch pools if they truly disagree.

I think consensus is not (only) about the miners.
To give an extreme example: if 75% of the miners are mining BIP101 blocks, but 90% of the users would still use the "current protocol", then I think we can agree that the "current protocol" is still bitcoin and the majority of the miners are wasting their hash rate on some altcoin.
We could assume that everyone would switch, but that is nothing but an assumption. What if the biggest mining pool changes his mind (during that 2 grace period weeks) and will still mine based on the "current protocol" even though the fork is already planned? Mining hash rate would be divided by 50 / 50, users also divided and fork is still incoming. No way, that this would be good for bitcoin.
I really think the proper way is: *creating many (different) solutions/proposals, give arguments for them, coding them, testing them, reviewing them and comparing them to get a reasonable consensus that most experts and users can live with; is much better than creating different software based on each proposal and try to "win it".*
But yes, if we have real consensus and most people switch to BIP101 (or whatever BIP), then that would be bitcoin and the "current protocol" would be either useless/abandoned or an altcoin if it still has a small user base.

I am not a troll, but thanks for the downvote.
If they are using a clone of  it seems better to use the original Copay. If there is a vulnerability, it will probably be fixed in Copay before the Bitcoin.com wallet.
Additionally as part-time security researcher I reported security vulnerabilities to a lot of bitcoin sites (poloniex, bitcointalk, many gambling sites, etc) And Roger Ver is the only one who acknowledged the vulnerability that I reported, but never had it fixed.. even now after more than a year. While this specific vulnerability is not in their wallet software, I would not trust anything from them if they prioritize security like that.
Besides that, the fact that bitcoin.com is on a whole campaign of "bcash is the real bitcoin", should be enough reason to stay away from them too. But not even the main reason in this case.

That is pretty correct. But it doens't *need* to be full of TXs though (it just makes sense to earn most.) Then they change nonce, timestamp and (if needed) coinbase TX to get new hashes until they find one that match the target.

No problem, more green in the charts indeed lol.
About "BV" vote: probably it was after the June draft indeed. Still I think it's safe to interpret as "original 8MB vote" because most miners were voting on support for one-time 8MB increase (some with and some without "BV".) Although I guess technically that is the BIP 100 usage and the miners should just change it already if they don't vote for that any more :p

You can use different wallet apps as long as they use the same HD address generation method and seed wordlist.
I think you can use [Multibit HD]( on Mac and [Mycelium]( on Android. They both seem to use BIP32 for address generation and BIP39 for wordlist, so it should work, but I didn't try. Create a new wallet on either one of them, write down the seed and import the seed in the other app.

Sorry, but didn't read after the first sentence. The future products of CME, CBOE and Nasdaq are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), not by the SEC. CFTC already approved the futures of LedgerX, so they probably will allow these other (much bigger ones) too.
SEC is more strict, hence denying bitcoin ETFs 2 times already (and causing another 1 to withdraw.)

I don't really see the problem with opt-in RBF. I guess just more wallet should implement it :) (including some kind of auto-bump method.)
There is a [PR]( for Bitcoin Core to enable RBF by default though (just on personal wallet level for your own TXs.)
What would be epic if Bitcoin Core has some "*batch all TXs and RBF*" function. Especially for services that do a lot of TXs with Bitcoin Core's simple RPC methods, it could save some serious fees and blockchain space (less change addresses etc.) But I guess developing this is pretty tricky (and perhaps should be done on client-side instead.)

Still this bullshit? BTC on segwit addresses are not spendable by miners.
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:32:13
That is exactly what I said...
If I am a miner at Slush and I want to vote for BIP 100. Then currently I cannot do that. So I would be keeping the default port.
You say this means I would be voting for "No change". I disagree, it simply means I didn't get the option to vote what I really want.
Therefore I think those who vote on default "Others" represent people who want "No change", BUT ALSO people who want "BIP 100" etc.
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:08:25
I am not sure what you want to do exactly.
Do you want to express your support for a blocksize increase? TBH best to just wait. I think it's very clear basically everybody wants an increase. The question is "how much increase to start with, when to start, and how much to increase yearly". There are currently 4 official proposals, see a nice summary here:  I personally expect to see more proposals next month.
Do you want to express your support for 1 of the proposals, the most aggressive and XT integrated, BIP101? (8MB in 2016, double every 2 years, up to 8GB) You could compile the bitcoin-core software like user "nomminommi" explained.
@_date: 2015-08-28 13:25:24
Yeah, let's base the entire protocol on something, just because it's the first working implementation. "*Whoever is first with the code, gets into the protocol.. yeah!*" That policy would work great.
Also, one shouldn't get the illusion that BIP 100 is already agreed upon. It's "just" miners voting on it (luckily there is no hostile "activate upon 75% miner support" software for BIP 100) -  we are still far from consensus. It will still be reviewed and questioned by many developers/experts/random people like me/etc, especially indeed after the more final BIP and code.

Not really. Most importantly just keep your bitcoin wallet software up-to-date.
There is a **very small** chance that there will be 2 different forks in January 2016, so around that time you might want to check to see if there is any panic. In that situation you could experience trouble sending bitcoins to someone who is looking at other fork etc. Still you will have all your bitcoin btw, just sending/receiving will be more tricky.

Your site says that KnC and 21 vote for BIP 100? Is that correct? According to BlockTrail these are the ones who have or had "BIP 100 vote blocks": [F2Pool]( [bitfury]( [kano]( [bitclub]( and [btchina]( (some blocks.) Besides that KnC is suppose to be a "BIP 101" supporter (with BIP 101 blocks potentially in the future.) I think [this]( is the way BT qualifies the block size votes, is there a difference with that?
@_date: 2015-08-20 05:37:19
Maybe it would have been better if BitPay was slightly more involved and be part of  for example (like exchanges Kraken, Cryptsy, itBit, etc.) Getting all experts together to analyse the problem, set the requirements for the proposals and properly test the technical proposals with simulation and benchmark tests - seems better than just saying "lets do 8MB to 8GB".

Anyone doing this manually isn't going to "intentionally" put missing parts of letters. Besides, the latest script seems to be adjusted where only the 'b' has a missing part (not the 'c' or 'n'.) IMO just run the script without any missing part so it's an easy-to-read word.

Ironically a great example of the importance of non-mining nodes is the "*segwit anyone-can-spend outputs can be stolen by miners*" logic.
They argue that if 51% of the miners decide to steal those outputs, they could. The thing is, this will cause a hard fork / split. And all the non-mining (economic) nodes, the users and businesses, will follow the normal old fork where segwit output cannot be stolen. So essentially these miners will be on a new worthless alt coin. The miners can do this with anything btw. They can just as well decide to steal all "satoshi coins", but it doesn't matter.. because the rest of the network will not follow them. 
This shows the importance of non-mining nodes (especially those who are actually used for transactions.) 51% of the miners are literally just 4 people and essentially just 1 big manufacturer (Bitmain / Jihan Wu.) If bitcoin is ruled by only these people, IMO it's completely worthless. If the government of China can just give them a visit and pressure them for changes, how is bitcoin still decentralized and censorship resistant?
But luckily (so far) they couldn't switch to the changes they want (BU/EC) even with more than 50% hashrate, because they know the rest of the community/network wouldn't follow them. However, IMO SW2x is slightly different in the sense that it does have *some* businesses/users behind it (unlike BU/EC.) It's clearly not enough to call it consensus by any means though and will set a bad precedent.

Actually replied on but:
There were 6 companies that tried to file for bitcoin ETFs based on the bitcoin futures. SEC made [a letter with concerns]( and called these companies to withdraw their registrations. 5 of them withdrew, 1 of them not. The ones that were withdrawn were registrations by form N-1A and the one left was GraniteShares ETP by S-1. (Perhaps the process for S-1 withdrawal is less likely or something - IDK lol.)
GraniteShares still didn't withdraw. They actually had a [S-1 amendment]( just on March 8 (relatively small changes though.) So I am not sure what they will do. Next SEC decision for them is at [April 18]( - but SEC will most likely just delay it again.
Overall I still have 0% hope for ETFs at this year, but it is interesting that GraniteShares ETP wasn't withdrawn yet.

Altcoin bcash had their "difficulty cheat scheme" triggered, so it's temporarily more profitable to mine bcash than bitcoin. Therefor some miners switched and confirmations are temporarily slower on bitcoin.

Yes, the long-term "vision" of bcash is just a "dozen nodes" from miners and *maybe* a few big businesses.

Cannot cancel the TXs. Actually the bigger TX is essentially canceled, because most nodes ignored it and it would most likely not reach a miner. If it does reach a miner (and they mine it), obviously your problem is solved too.
There is a small chance that could speed up the 0.035 BTC TX, by spending one of the children and putting a relatively high miner fee (so assuming you have access to either of those 2 addresses.)
But either way, the solution is to make a TX without that 0.035 BTC input. You will have to figure out if this is possible with Mycelium. Potentially just installing Mycelium on (another or same) phone and re-using the 12-word seed backup (that you should have), could work. Perhaps even just re-opening Mycelium could drop the TX. I really don't know how Mycelium works.
PS, as long as you control the wallets and have backups of those seeds, no money is lost.
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:56:12
You should have used a real bitcoin exchange with low fees (probably with SEPA transfers like BitStamp or Kraken.) This will be a bit slower and more complicated but has a low fee.
On Changelly you pay with a creditcard but there are massive fraud risks and huge fees involved. Therefor you paid a huge fee while buying your bitcoin.

Interesting. 20-100 sat/byte should be confirmed last few hours. 369 sat/bye is paying way too much. So that is not the problem here.
It seems that somehow your transaction didn't get broadcasted properly through the network. Because blockcypher seems to be one of the few block explorers to see the TX. I am not sure what causes this. But I do assume that (eventually) one of the miners see the TX and mines it (especially because it has a relatively high fee, so high priority.)
Since both of the wallets are from you (and I assume you still have sole access to both wallets), there is essentially 0% chance you lost the money ;) So no worries, just wait.
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:00:59
Nice job. Note that the current `addwitnessaddress` way is mostly for testing purposes. Ideally in a future Core release there will be a simple config option to make the whole wallet use segwit (including GUI and change addresses.) I am hoping someone will implement it in 0.15.1 (not 0.15.0 because feature-frozen.)
So personally I have still been recommending other dice sites to only use segwit if they already use raw transactions. Although the extra dev time might be worth the fees (kinda depends on when that Core release with SW-wallet support will come too.)

My personal opinion against 2x (even though I definitely want to see more blocksize increases as well) is written in my [reply here]( although I obviously cannot speak for Mandrik so I do not know if his arguments are the same.

Embarrassing that's it's just the CEOs of these companies that don't seem to understand that this isn't about increasing the blocksize, but about setting a bad precedent.
They made an "agreement" in private (rather than suggesting a "proposal/plan" for the rest of the community.) They did nothing to convince us why their plan is the best. They completely ignored the technical community. They are trying to force their hardfork upon everyone by not adding strong replay protection. And now that more and more users/businesses are speaking up against it, they just arrogantly say "***We, The CEOs, represent millions of users and therefor decide what bitcoin is and what changes are made.***"
Bitcoin is decentralized money for the people and controlled by the people. Changes, especially non-backward compatible controversial ones, should be difficult to make and require "everyone" (users, businesses, developers, miners, etc) to agree on it. This isn't easy and that is a good thing, because it shows potential bad actors (governments, banks, etc) cannot force changes upon bitcoin either. Measuring the consensus for changes isn't an easy/clear process. But I believe we are seeing it *right now*, with people/devs/businesses standing up against the 2x HF, clearly showing that there isn't consensus for this change.
I do believe that SW2x and these CEOs *did* have good intentions with their agreement. But it isn't how bitcoin works. Bitcoin cannot be controlled by a few CEOs. And the more they are attempting to force this change, the more resistance there will be. It isn't too late to cancel it though. Maybe instead of trying to generate a mess (which is guaranteed at this point), they should focus on putting some resources into a proper future hardfork. Offer some bounties around spoonnet research, a dynamic blocksize, proper network testing, etc. Rusty Rusell has some decent [blog posts]( on it.

@_date: 2017-10-31 06:19:06
Because the B2X proponents claim to be 60 - 80% of bitcoin's transactions (and use that as argument of why The CEOs should dictate the changes on the bitcoin protocol.) But if they adopt segwit on their services now, the "emergency need" for the 2x HF will be gone, so they don't implement it yet. They rather force a contentious hard-fork (which will make a mess) than let their developers work on the segwit implementation on their services.
@_date: 2017-10-30 06:18:54
By default most nodes drop the TXs after 2 weeks of being in the mempool. Therefor it is pretty likely that you can already spent those inputs again and the new TX would be mined just fine. 
How to actually make the new TX depends on the wallet software you use. Essentially the wallet needs to "forget" about the old TX, but it highly depends on the wallet software on how to do that. An option that would most likely work is using the wallet backup (seed words or other) and import in another wallet (or the same re-installed.)
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:54:30
You can just run a full node on your PC/laptop. If that wallet only has TXs from 2012, the sync till those TXs would be actually pretty quick. Not sure why you prefer to put your wallet on a cloud server.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:34:30


I think this is an old announcement, because the opt-in replay protection has been removed because it was flawed.
The CEOs now seem to prefer "no replay protection" so they can really try to force their changes upon us. Meanwhile they *do* let their developers add custom replay protection on their own services. Essentially smaller sites/services (with limited developer resources) and (non-technical) users are being screwed over by them which can cause serious potential losses. All while they do have the developer resources to protect themselves (uhm.. it either needs replay protection or not?) Bunch of hypocrites. They could just add proper replay protection to B2X and make sure nobody loses money. But they realize their changes do not have consensus and still want to try and force the changes upon everyone.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:15:15
This seems to be an [address of a cloud mining]( site called Auroramine. The reason why it has so many small transactions is because poor people are "investing" small amounts of money hoping to become rich from this ponzi scam.
In the end they would still operate without segwit, so at least by using segwit there is a bit more transaction throughput. They should do batch payments though (which I guess is what you meant.)
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:28:40
I got the raw TX in hex format from [blockcypher api]( and tried to manually re-broadcast it through [blockchain.info]( But it shows the following error:


After quickly looking, 1 of your inputs worth 0.035 BTC:


is used in another unconfirmed transaction:


This means you (your wallet) basically tried to double-spent this money (which is of course not possible.) What makes the situation worse is that only 1 sat/byte was used in that TX. So it will take a long time before that is mined or dropped from the mempool.
So if possible you should make a new TX without that 0.035 BTC input. I am not familiar enough with Mycelium to know how to do this. It potentially includes exporting the private key and use other software to do this.
There is also a small chance that a miner *still* sees the bigger TX and mines that instead, which would drop the 0.035 TX.
@_date: 2017-10-18 05:47:45

If Electrum gives the option to bump the fee, you could indeed do that.

***Re BIP:*** There has been some blocksize HF BIPs from Bitcoin Core developers already. None have had a lot of community support and were therefor not merged. I think Bitcoin Core will only merge a HF if it has significant community support. Also AFAIK the plan has always be to see how the segwit-increased-blocksize affects the network (less/more nodes, potential problems, etc), just too bad it was stalled so long. Doing 1 blocksize increase at the time and see how it affects the network, seems like the scientific/logical approach to me.
***Re segwit:*** You should blame the few big block extremists and miners for stalling segwit. Segwit could have been activated many many months earlier, if it weren't for them. It is so hypocrite to say "*segwit adoption takes many months*" while *they* are the ones who blocked it for many months.
Segwit was always going to be a gradual/slow increase of the blocksize to realistically ~1.9x (which is almost double - that *is* a lot in relative terms.) Slowly increasing it to make fees a bit lower while not completely making them unnecessary (which isn't realistic for the future), seems actually good to me.
But you are right, the adoption is somewhat slow so far. This shows the hypocrisy of "The CEOs" even more. Instead of putting some of their developers on adopting segwit for their own services to have more transaction throughput for the whole bitcoin network, they are lazy and rather want to disrupt the network with their HF.

It is interesting to follow the numbers, but pretty irrelevant to estimate what will happen after the fork.

If 51% of miners wants to steal segwit outputs, it would be a hard fork into an alt coin. Why would the rest of users/businesses follow those stealing miners and switch from bitcoin to their new alt coin?
This can be done with anything. 51% of the miners could decide to steal the ~1 million bitcoin that are allegedly from Satoshi too. Would you follow the miners if they decide to steal that? Of course not.
Essentially if they would try it, they would only cause a temporary mess for people who aren't properly verifying TXs, some price panic, loss of confidence in miners, potential POW algorithm switch (so they won't get any bitcoin revenue anymore), etc. (although technically bitcoin would still work fine.) TLDR; not a problem.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:45:01
Yes. It makes you wonder why some of the B2x proponents like BitPay, Blockchain.info wallet, BTC.com wallet, Coinbase, Xapo, etc are not yet using segwit. They claim to:
1. be a big part of the bitcoin transactions
2. have such a dire need for more transaction throughput that they are willing to do make a chain-split with a contentious hard-fork.
They are either lazy to develop it on their services and would rather make a mess on the bitcoin network. Or they realize that segwit will significantly continue to make the blocksize bigger and transaction throughput higher, which would demolish their need for an "emergency quick hardfork" that (conveniently for them) sets a precedent to have "The Bitcoin CEOs" dictating the changes on the network.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:20:27
Are you sure it's segwit? Or are you saying this because their addresses start with 3?
Because they have been using that for years (multisig addresses look the same as segwit.) Upon quickly looking at some blockchain analysis site, I don't see segwit transactions from BitStamp yet. But I didn't try depositing/withdrawing myself (and new wallet wouldn't be labeled as BitStamp on analysis sites yet.)
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:43:22
Which new TX.. the bump fee TX?
If yes, that is meant to be like that.. the parent is the unconfirmed 0.035 BTC TX. The bump TX is bumping it by spending one of the outputs (= child) and adding a relatively high mining fee so hopefully a miner includes the 0.035 BTC TX so they can earn the fees of the child TX (= the bump TX.)
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:25:08
I believe Roger Ver specifically said he will go full bcash-tard if B2X failed. But he already seems to be starting to do that. And Jihan Wu seems to be the main person behind bcash (created the idea, spread propaganda on conferences even before it forked, indirectly paid the developers through the Bitcoin Development Grant, celebrated the fork on weibo and other channels "*finally free*", tweeting mostly about bcash last few weeks, etc.)
So yes, I do think it's realistic scenario that B2X will fail, BTC will stay BTC and BCH will gain (more "official") support from some of these characters. I do think this will be good for BCH so I definitely agree that BCH supporters should fight against B2X as well.
I don't agree with your "*slowing down to unusable degree*" angle though. The market will still value BTC higher and therefor will be still plenty of hashrate even if it is "slower" for a few weeks.

Ironically a great example of the importance of non-mining nodes is the "*segwit anyone-can-spend outputs can be stolen by miners*" logic.
They argue that if 51% of the miners decide to steal those outputs, they could. The thing is, this will cause a hard fork / split. And all the non-mining (economic) nodes, the users and businesses, will follow the normal old fork where segwit output cannot be stolen. So essentially these miners will be on a new worthless alt coin. The miners can do this with anything btw. They can just as well decide to steal all "satoshi coins", but it doesn't matter.. because the rest of the network will not follow them. 
This shows the importance of non-mining nodes (especially those who are actually used for transactions.) 51% of the miners are literally just 4 people and essentially just 1 big manufacturer (Bitmain / Jihan Wu.) If bitcoin is ruled by only these people, IMO it's completely worthless. If the government of China can just give them a visit and pressure them for changes, how is bitcoin still decentralized and censorship resistant?
But luckily (so far) they couldn't switch to the changes they want (BU/EC) even with more than 50% hashrate, because they know the rest of the community/network wouldn't follow them.
So segwit is perfectly safe. The lower average is probably caused by specific types of transactions. Withdrawals from exchanges to be able to claim bgold sounds reasonable.

It should be either 16 Aug (45 days after [Federal Register publication]( or, more likely, 30 Sep (90 days after Federal Register publication.) Normally they just take most time possible, so that would be **30 September 2018**.
Then they can actually accept and reject it, but also decide that they need more time. They normally take that last option. So it is pretty likely they will delay it as long as possible (240 days) so the final deadline would be **27 Feb 2019**.
PS, note that the first real decision deadline (= 240 days) for one of the "bitcoin futures ETFs" ([ProShares Bitcoin ETF]( is **23 August 2018**, so this is a more interesting date to watch right now.

You sold 0.16319 for $305 when the price was $1869. You used those $305 to rebuy 0.073557 when the price was $4146. Basically you did the "*sell low, buy high*" strategy and obviously lost money on it. Otherwise you would have had 0.18151 BTC = $764 (at current price.)

The "previous" SolidX ETF proposal that got denied has **exactly** the same insurance and **exactly**  same custodian (SolidX.) **It is the same proposal** just with some amendments to the registration.
One can simply compare the [third amendment]( to the SolidX S1 registration (from Feb, 2017 - before they got denied at [March, 2017]( with the [fourth amendment]( (Jan 2018) + [fifth amendment]( (June 2018.) Changes:
- Obviously instead of NYSE Arca, they now try to be listed on Cboe BZX (and fourth still mentions Bats BZX - because CBOE bought that exchange hence the rename.)
- VanEck (major ETF issuer) is a "marketing partner" (read: VanEck gets some money so SolidX can use VanEck's name on the shares.)
- The amendments have some paragraphs added about regulations in different countries. I do agree with OP that this is a difference. Specifically the fact that the CFTC allowed the bitcoin futures.
- Before they would use a "XBX spot prize" (based on exchanges) but now the "MVIS® Bitcoin OTC Index" ("MVBTCO".) This index doesn't actually exist yet.
- Just in general, there is more emphasize on OTC markets. The Trust will do most of it's trading with the OTC platforms that will be in the MVIS index (but may use Bitstamp, GDAX, Gemini, itBit, bitFlyer and Kraken too.)
- Then just some small changes.
Overall there aren't *that* many changes. And specifically after the SEC letter with concerns/questions from [January 18, 2018]( it seems like they didn't change much to address those concerns. As noted [by someone else]( there are still a lot of blanks too (100+) and the OTC index doesn't even exist yet - so delaying the SEC decision seems very obvious to me. So far, SEC has always delayed their decision till the very end with every bitcoin proposal. The SEC can delay their decision over this SolidX ETF till **27 Feb 2019**.
edit: PS, there were some [bitcoin ETF proposals]( that were based on the bitcoin futures (instead of "real bitcoins".) [August 23]( is the final deadline for one of them (ProShares) - that cannot be delayed. So this date is somewhat interesting.

That isn't online right? Because if you have 8,400 BTC online, expect many hacking attempts.
Actually, if you are serious about owning 8,400 BTC, you made yourself a target already. You are not using a throwaway account and I am sure you shared enough information so others can identify you. You should consider both your online *and* offline security.
Make sure the device(s) that has the private keys of those bitcoins are never connected to the internet. Make sure to make some (encrypted) backups. Make sure to not share too much information with anyone. Do not trust anyone. Take your time to see if these are really private keys that give access to the money. If it is, move it all to a more secure setup (hardware wallets, and look into multi-signature solutions.. even a hardware wallet cannot protect you against a serious offline threat.)

The ETF is not from the CBOE.
It is **the same SolidX ETF** (with VanEck as marketing partner) as 1-2 years ago. They want to be listed on Cboe BZX exchange so the rule change is filed by them. This always happens with every ETF. Just the same with the Winklevoss (rule change filed by Bats BZX - which is now the Cboe BZX) and the previous SolidX (rule change filed by NYSE Arca.) They both got rejected, the exchange who filed it doesn't make a difference.

Fee estimates are tricky and generally bad. Looking at  **40 sat/byte** would most likely confirm in next block. And like **20 sat/byte** in a few blocks. On this Sunday with the "temporary BCH miners" being back at BTC, even **5 sat/byte** will likely confirm later. Of course fee estimators don't have this context (BCH mining, Sunday, even "current mempool" is tricky, etc), so they simply look at previous blocks.
So your fee could have been between 0.00002200 (0.24%) - 0.00017600 (2%) for still quick confirmations. Note that the fees are not based on transaction amounts but transaction sizes in terms of byte. So a $1 million TX could have the same fee, so relatively that would obviously be extremely tiny.

If you enable pruning it will be only a few GBs (but initially you will download/verify all.) If you just want a full node and wallet for complete trustless security and better privacy, this would be fine.
If you want to fully help other nodes (for example send old blocks to new nodes) and use advanced features (like importing old used watch addresses), pruning might be not good though. In this case you would need around 95GB of space but ideally around 150GB to be ready for the future.

Sorry for your loss.
In theory he could have bitcoins in several places: software wallets on PC/phone, online bitcoin exchanges (Coinbase, Circle, Kraken, Bitstamp and many more), hardware wallets (dedicated small computers to store bitcoin), paper wallets (12 - 24 words that are the key to some bitcoin), online web wallets (Bitgo, blockchain.info, GreenAddress and more), services (game sites, marketplaces and more.) In most/some of those situations, they can be password-protected though.
Realistically I would say:
1) If you find **12-24 random words** (or perhaps QR codes or even just a lot of random characters) on a paper in his house - don't throw it away (and don't give it to anyone!) - this is probably a backup for a bitcoin wallet. IMO this is the most realistic way and most wallets do recommend to make a backup.
2) If possible you could look at the PC/phone to see if there is any wallet software installed ([some wallet names here]( Potentially you could also search USB drives for "wallet.dat" files (wallet backup) or bitcoin related software.
3) If you want to look further you could look into which bitcoin related sites he used, especially the exchanges. 
Best of luck.

Look, those altcoins are not bitcoin. I also think them being a software fork is pretty irrelevant. I could fork Geth and change most code to make it compatible with bitcoin. That would not make it a "version of ethereum", it would just be a bitcoin node in Go. Bitcoin is defined a lot more by social consensus, rather than technology (although it's the technology that actually enforces the consensus.)
Overall, you seem to agree that these altcoins are altcoins. So I am not sure what you are arguing about? This is the sub rule:

There are some articles like [this one on ZeroHedge]( which links "*Cumberland Mining*" to "***DRW Holdings LLC, a high-frequency trading firm***". Also CoinDesk made that link in a [different way here]( In addition that company was also included in the CC (instead of BCC) e-mail scandal at the first auction ([bloomberg]( So it seems like "DRW Holdings LLC" actually won those auction coins (and "Cumberland Mining" is a DRW subsidiary.)
You can also look at the blockchain and find clues there:
If you look at one of their [wallets]( (the one that got the 27k last time) you can see several transactions with BitFinex (even before that auction.) From their 27k that time, 2k of it was deposited right in their [BitFinex depo addy]( (they used 1 same depo addy that time - so you can see a long history of deposits there.) In that 27k wallet, you can also see transactions coming in from BitFinex (so withdrawals from BitFinex), which makes it a possibility that it's maybe not just "cashing out" on BitFinex - but potentially it is trading related (which would make sense if it's that DRW trading firm.)

The solution to the "double spend problem" is the blockchain. Mining those blocks every 10 minutes is not a problem, but **the solution** to the double spend problem.

IMO: never sell bitcoin for Paypal. There has been an insane amount of scams with that. Problem is: Paypal transactions are easily reversible (up to 3-6 months after the transaction), while bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Officially "virtual currencies" are not allowed to be sold on Paypal anyway, so you will not have much options to get your money back either.
I have seen plenty of scams where the paypal buyer did many transactions in many months, built a great reputation and reversed them all after some months.

This is not true at all. It is still **the same SolidX ETF** (with VanEck as marketing partner.) They want to be listed on Cboe BZX exchange so the rule change is filed by them. This always happens with every ETF. Just the same with the Winklevoss (rule change filed by Bats BZX - which is now the Cboe BZX) and the previous SolidX (rule change filed by NYSE Arca.) They both got rejected, the exchange who filed it doesn't make a difference.
At least look at the [rule change proposal]( or maybe look up the [S1 registrations]( before making such video.

I meant that let's say I move all BCH from many addresses in once (especially with Trezor/Ledger "claim" functions), they potentially can be grouped together and reveal that 1 person owns them (and the bitcoin on same addresses.) Of course they can be sent 1 by 1 over time, but takes some effort (:

I agree 1.7 MB is more realistic estimate for usage. But it can be *possibly* in 2 days. *Possibly* in 20 years. How much time it takes is everyone's guess. I personally think a lot of transactions are done by services (exchanges, gambling sites, payment processors, blockchain.info, etc.) They have a good incentive to update (save fees) and therefor I do think within just a few months a majority of transactions will use Segwit. But it is still a guess.
To consider the risk though, you will want to look at a potential attack. A potential attack could fill the blocks to 3 MB - 4 MB. If you want to double that to almost 8 MB with a HF, the network is pretty likely to have huge problems (according to the analysis of Classic developer jtoomin last year at least - I don't know how much the latest improvements help the network.)

It's a pity generally doesn't like gambling, but lets sum it up here:
- Provably fair by the blockchain (no cheating possible)
- EV+ (positive edge to bet)
- Easy to bet (it's bitcoin after all) 
- Trusted owner (also owns: MoneyPot = 763 coins invested + one of biggest btc gambling sites Bustabit)

Since 19 months I run a little statistics site for [Dice Sites]( and BetKing (former PRC) has been around for a long time, has big wagered amounts and 3-5k invested for over a year. Clearly one of biggest if we only compare dice sites (and imo dice sites are still biggest with few exceptions.)

So according to your [TX]( you added a fee of 12.6 sat per byte. If you look at:  you will see that this is very low. This isn't a real problem.. it still got confirmed in 12 hours. But if you want it to be confirmed quicker, you really must add a higher fee (~5x higher.)
Note: it's about the transaction size in terms of (kilo)bytes. Your transaction of almost 800 bytes is a lot bigger than the median transaction size of 256 bytes.

It disgusts me that a government can just decide an innovation like bitcoin is bad and therefore "*no one is allowed to use it*". They are generally just waiting for an incident (like this kidnapping) to happen to justify a reason of banning. It obviously doesn't make any sense, kidnappers will not care about the legality of bitcoin and can still demand it.
There are a lot of Filipinos working in Taiwan who could benefit by using bitcoin as remittance - but that is illegal now.

I am not a Satoshi-block-expert, but:
* [1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa]( (block  - The genesis block. A signed message with this address seems like the best proof. But those coins cannot be spent (and he claims to move coins), so this one is out.
* [12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S]( (block  - First P2P transaction from Satoshi to Hal Finney.
AFAIK there is no real proof for any other address.
There has been some researches like:  and  which look pretty cool. But I am personally not sure how accurate that is to be considered proof.
[Gavin said]( that CW signed a message from address of block  - [1HLoD9E4SDFFPDiYfNYnkBLQ85Y51J3Zb1]( If he spends those coins, I will personally probably believe it. Especially since those "extraNonce" theories/researches confirm block  also to be mined by Satoshi (afaik?) Obviously there would be people claiming that it could be someone else than Satoshi.. which in theory definitely seems true too.
I also do not expect him to really move those block  or block  coins **at all**, but let's first see what happens and then "*consider if it's really him*".
Edit: actually according to The Economist:


So best to just move the coins of both block  and  pretty easy if you have the private keys of those addresses.

OP, it seems like you have no idea how the provably fair mechanism works.
I made an article about the [provably fair]( mechanism with the basics and verifiers for 15 different bitcoin gambling sites. With the provably fair mechanism you can 100% know if you have been cheated if you take the (small) effort to verify your bets. I think it's insane to trust a piece of paper (that regulations/certificates give you) more than a simple cryptographic function. Provably fair is all about not having to trust the gambling site for your bet results, you can calculate all the results yourself. After understanding the provably fair mechanism, I cannot imagine anyone would still play on those "traditional sites" that don't have this.
If you combine that with the full transparency most bitcoin gambling sites have, the lowest house edges of the whole gambling industry (far lower than your local casino!), the ~10 min deposits and instant withdrawals... I think bitcoin gambling is absolutely great.
Does this mean that there are no scams? Absolutely not, plenty of scams. I always recommend players to play on the websites that have been around for a relatively long time and have a good reputation, never keep too much on the sites (quick deposit/withdrawal anyway) and to always verify their bets.
Ps, sites like LockPoker were also regulated... still a scam that owes players millions? I thought that was impossible?
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:35:28
Not really, but in the weekends and at nights (US/EU night), fees can be much lower. So if you are sweeping up all those small inputs (which really is a special TX!) you should choose such specific moment to send your transaction. Ideally just very low fee based on  and use RBF so can still bump little bit.

**I prefer for news items and bitcointalk.org for discussions.**
***Longer overview of things I follow:***
great for news and therefore has more mainstream users. Disadvantage: each topic will expire in 1-2 days and I dislike votes sometimes because of vote manipulation (or just people that disagree with me) - especially in "discussions".
great for bitcoin trading discussions/news.
Other subreddits (alternatives of this subreddit): IMO I wouldn't be against it, but currently the topics there are heavily focused on a few things (just look at the votes there): pro XT, pro BIP101, constant complaining about and Core, etc. Basically IMO they don't focus on providing good quality bitcoin related things and are very focused on just being upset.
[bitcointalk.org]( better for longer discussions and more diverse kind of discussion (because of no voting.) For example "Gambling" doesn't get upvotes on this subreddit, but it's popular to talk about there. Disadvantage: lot of signature campaign spam imo.
[forum.bitcoin.com]( alternative forum, the AMAs are cool. Disadvantage: not really popular yet so not much to talk about yet. Also tendency of being "complaining" focused like the alternative subreddits, but I hope this becomes less.
[mailinglist: bitcoin-dev]( good place for bitcoin development discussion.
[bitcoin core github]( plenty of bitcoin core development discussion are on the issues and pull requests of bitcoin core github too.

Provably fair is much more difficult with poker than most "gambling games". There is some work in progress here: but far from ready for production.

It's only a small answer to a small (off-topic) question in a thread on a relatively small mailing list. I think it's unfair to say he should have given long arguments in that context.
It seems to me that Amir Taaki is someone who is very capable of giving arguments for his opinions (which you may or may not agree with.)
He actually had a related interview in July 2014: [**Bitcoin's "Political Neutrality is a Myth"**]( if you want to see a bit more of his views. IMO, he basically predicts the creation of XT by Gavin, Mike Hearn and "bitcoin company CEOs" - way before XT was created.

This is exactly why I like that the blocks are "*a little bit full*". It seems obvious to me that plenty of sites still use the blockchain inefficiently with more transactions than they really need. This little bit of a fee market forces them to improve this. Basically improving scalability on the usage layer indeed.
Of course there is a certain limit with this and I am very confident that SegWit will be used by that time for an extra bump.

Actually in a way he is emphasizing why bigger blocks are bad with his "*we can do it with a network shared by banks and large companies*". Also from all of this, it mostly made Gavin look bad.

Either way I think CW is just CW and that report might have been made by CW or a "*big-blocker Greg-hater individual who saw an opportunity*", but not much more than that.

Great that your transaction is broadcasted now. The chances are pretty high that it will be confirmed eventually. But still, it seems like you found some old information about the minimum fee, because it's really low. So it will still take long before the transactions will be confirmed.


Seems like you put a fee of 0.00001/kB - 1 satoshi/byte? That is really low, look at:  for estimated "confirmation time" with each specific fee level. You used the lowest fee level. It might take 10+ hours to get a confirmation.
If you need quicker transactions in the future, you should use a 60x higher fee of 0.0006/kB - 60 satoshi/byte. For a lot of the transactions, this is still only around $0.06. In my experience, most transactions will be in next block (~10 mins) with such fee.

LN transactions are literally just bitcoin transactions. But instead of broadcasting them to every node and have every node verify/store them, you just send them to the receiver only. Technically that's just a payment channel and LN adds routing to create a whole network of such channels. Completely trustless. Who owns/controls it? Same as bitcoin, the nodes running LN.

I don't care what you do with your own HD.

@_date: 2017-07-19 04:54:27
BIP91 doesn't do any HF. SW2x, that uses BIP91 for SW activation, plans to HF 3 months after SW activation.
They don't "require" any hashpower.. any miner using their software will HF 3 months after SW activation.
That chart tries to show if there will be a chain split or not. Only if 100% follows the HF, no minority chain will exists (because everyone is mining on HF chain), so no chain split. But if (for example) they only have 50% of hashrate, the HF will still occur and we would just have 2 bitcoin chains with each 50% of hashpower.

CF simply works as a CDN/MITM between the visitor and the website. This doesn't need much research, it is well known. The traffic goes from the visitor to CF. Then they send it to your server. Even all IPs you will get are from CF (with an extra header with the original IP.) If you read the [SSL section]( it will talk about 2 SSL certificates: from CF to the visitor and from your server to CF. I really think it's clear for anyone to see that CF can see all traffic from all of those companies.
Now while I sound so negative, I use CF myself too for a [small site]( (and some others.) They are pretty good, protect well against DDOS but even just spam-bots, good CDN with proper caching and they even have free "universal" SSL. This is all for $0. Obviously in a way, you pay by sacrificing the privacy of your visitors and business. Not so relevant for my small sites though, but more so for the ones in OP.
edit: I am not saying CF "needs" this against DDOS, I am just saying this is really how they work.

Yes there is.
There are 4 separate implementations of the [LN protocol]( that use the same "BOLT standard" so they are (or will be) fully compatible with each other:
* [**Eclair**]( (ACINQ) - also made an Android LN wallet: [Eclair Wallet Testnet](
* [**c-lightning**]( (Blockstream)
* [**lit**]( (MIT Digital Currency Initiative)
* [**lnd**]( (Lightning Co) - extra projects on top of 'lnd': [Colu]( [lncli-web]( [lnd-gui]( [ln-dice](
You can test them with Bitcoin's regtest and testnet. So this way you can prepare for running a LN node.
Actual segwit activation will be on block  (in ~34 days), so you can't use LN on mainnet till then.

This is an old reddit post:  from 7 months ago (explains the BTC price.) Perhaps automatic spam bot which explains the "CEO" in username.
Few things as someone who used Rebit over 10 times:
1. They don't have fees anymore, so that 100 PHP fee is no more. (obv there are still transfer fees [that 300PHP] for cash pickup methods)
2. They instantly confirm my transactions, although they probably wait a confirmation before actually sending the money. This is actually a new feature since that 7 month old post.
3. Even though they do that, I personally remember a 3 hour time-frame to accept the money. But perhaps this time-frame is smaller for new customers.
4. Still sending money (including buying+selling bitcoin) is not "always" cheaper with bitcoin methods. But it generally is cheapest for me :)

An argument could be that he thought he could convince Gavin more easily if he shared the same/similar vision. Or it's simply a reason of the need for that fake supercomputer if we take the "tax defraud reasoning".


I know but I mean maybe people will realize that "*a network shared by banks*" is a bad thing (especially if you combine it with that MIT research) and that's why almost the whole technical community doesn't want those big blocks. So even though CW means it as a good thing, I think it actually emphasizes why it's a bad thing for the public.
So basically: even if it is a smear campaign against "the small blockers", I don't think it's working so far ;)

Pretty nice. does the same:
First they had it in CSS, but everyone complained because it's cached pretty hard so it won't update easily. Image is not possible either.
Now they have a script that updates the flair of bot/moderator "BitcoinMarkets" to the latest prices. Normally this is shown on the right under "Moderators" but some CSS moves this specific flair to the top to show it. So it can update frequently :)
This is technically the only way to do it right (afaik.) Could definitely work for too for several stats.

# Community
I think we have established that the majority of technical community, companies and users support segwit (coin.dance poli etc.)
Support for the "2x blockweight HF" isn't really clear. It seems like some of the bigger companies like BitPay, Blockchain.info and Coinbase support it (which is in the agreement.) However the majority of the technical community (so far all Core developers) don't seem to support it. Users seem somewhat divided. One way to look at this is:

 NYA coinbase text
The Chinese miners (and Bitfury... so almost all?) pledged to put "NYA" in the coinbase text starting today. So on sites like coin.dance you will see that number slowly going up, presumably towards this 90%. Note that this isn't actually signaling towards activation, it's just symbolic.
 Irony
If all the miners that support segwit2x would signal normal segwit today, hashrate would be around 98% for segwit and it would be activated within a few weeks.

They never "hired Core". Core is merely a group of people working (almost all voluntarily) on their project and suggesting improvements on the bitcoin protocol that may or may not be adopted by the community. In this case, it seems like the community will adopt their feature (segwit), so I don't see how they fire Core with that.
And even if the community adapts a 2x blockweight HF, which isn't made by Core, that still isn't "firing Core". It is merely taking an "improvement" from another developer and adapting that. Core never claimed to have "sole authority" over bitcoin and would not want to have that.
This is a stupid statement (=moronic) with as sole purpose to be toxic and trying to divide the community. They are simply trying to suggest that Core is very bad and in that case, it *doesn't* make sense to run software that is 99.9999% based on Core.
I indeed think it's okay to call them out on that. Especially if the spirit of this "compromise" (segwit2x) is to come together as a community and move forward, then I indeed think it is very toxic and stupid to make such statements. So let me repeat, ViaBTC are fucking toxic morons.
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:18:07
Yes, even just googling specific amounts (with quotes around them and 8 decimals) will show you the addresses/blocks/transactions. Since there are so many block explorers, this is practically always indexed by Google.
Cannot find any of those amounts though, which should say enough about credibility of this story.
edit: the more conclusive way is to directly look in the blockchain for those amounts, but this would take an adjusted bitcoin client as you normally cannot search the whole blockchain by output amounts.
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:31:59
I am not worried about JihanCoin, will never use that and that's obviously not bitcoin.
But the segwit2x HF is a different thing. Plenty of bad things: stupid privately organized, way too short timeframe, principle of "must have HF for segwit" is retarded, etc. And yet the blocksize itself is somewhat reasonable (compared to JihanCoin.) So potentially acceptable to me personally, although not a huge fan. If it will cause a big chain split though, I am not too confident in how the situation will be.
@_date: 2017-06-20 05:15:50
1. Bitcoin is literally an open ledger, it is not anonymous at all. However, your name is not really connected to each address/transaction, so it is pseudonymous.
2. No, with bitcoin *you* are the one to secure your bitcoin properly.
3. "Fast mining fee" should be around $2. Not too much for a serious poker player IMO. It depends on the time though (how many TXs there are), so you can also send it much cheaper.. if you are not in hurry (or in weekends / less busy times.)
4. First you have to use an exchange to buy bitcoin. While you could use Coinbase, you should know that they can freeze accounts if they think you use it for gambling (they will let you withdraw though if this happens.) Most poker players use 1 or even 2 wallets (proper mobile or desktop wallets like Electrum) between Coinbase and the poker site, to (hopefully) ensure that Coinbase cannot figure out that you are using it for gambling purposes.
For lot more info you should check out the bitcoin topics on 2p2.

@_date: 2017-06-19 05:00:19
Since segwit2x plans to activate segwit with BIP91 that requires ~80% of the hashrate to support it, it seems like a pretty relevant list.
The question is if the "2x blockweight HF" will be supported by the community (users, nodes, businesses, etc) too, in that sense the miners list isn't too relevant.
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:28:22

Yes, it is frustrating some people still call it "2MB" while it clearly isn't. That being said, 8 MB is the maximum mostly for special transactions and attacks.
Average depends on TX usage. These are the numbers based on [johoe's data]( The "BitFury 2.1MB" data unfortunately has no proper source.
TX usage | SW | 2x
No SW | 1 MB | 2 MB
P2SH ^1 ^2 | 1.54 MB | 3.08 MB
Native ^1 | 1.86 MB | 3.72 MB
Max | 4 MB | 8 MB
1) assumes 100% TXs use segwit and is based on current transactions.
2) P2SH has an *effective* blocksize of 1.54 MB (or 3.08 MB), but actually uses ~same amount of data as native(!) AFAIK native SW address format is still being developed.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:32:52
I don't think those words are too bad. They should run the updates the community/users/businesses want. IMO they shouldn't blindly follow any bitcoin implementation including Core. Resistance in that sense is good and it isn't too bad if they call that "*protector or guardian of the network*" (rather than "sole-deciders" or whatever Jihan thinks he is.) Of course with segwit it obviously has been taking too long though.
For example if another implementation would have a policy to implement transaction blacklisting on mining level (while obv majority of community wouldn't want that), miners should protect us from such bullshit "updates" too.

There are 4 separate implementations of the [LN protocol]( that use the same "BOLT standard" so they are fully compatible with each other:
* [**Eclair**]( (ACINQ)
* [**c-lightning**]( (Blockstream)
* [**lit**]( (MIT Digital Currency Initiative)
* [**lnd**]( (Lightning Co) - extra projects on top of 'lnd': [Colu]( [lncli-web]( [lnd-gui](
You can test them with Bitcoin's regtest and some do work on testnet (with Segwit-enabled) already. If segwit is enabled, afaik you *could* already run LN on mainnet right away. Does that mean it will be really used already? Obviously not. Routing might be still not perfect, GUI looks confusing for non-techs, "cheating outsourcing" might be not ready (in case you don't have full node), probably no sites that accept it, etc. But the LN development is way more active than some people seem to think and could be very nice (and somewhat popular) for instant small/micro transactions in like 1 or 2 years (my guess!)
Ps, there has been more implementations that aren't using the BOLT standard yet. Perhaps they will still add it when LN comes on mainnet though:
* [Amiko-Pay](
* [Thunder]( (Blockchain.info)

Well SEPA transfers are practically free. And those real exchanges like BitStamp and Kraken generally have a low 0.1-0.3% fee on changing your EUR to BTC (you will have to place an order and have it matched with other people's orders.)
So I would always recommend these 2 sites for people with SEPA. I have no idea if your bank actually supports SEPA transfers though.

I believe the amount of a payment is simply a [32 bit integer]( in millisatoshis. This automatically means the maximum is 4294967295 millisatoshi = ~0.0429 BTC. At current prices: ~$110 for "micro transactions" isn't too bad hehe. Channels are limited to [2^24 satoshi]( (= ~0.1677 BTC.) ([source about limit](
I agree it could go somewhat quick. Personally I have been hesitant to even test any of these implementations... simply because of the SW stalling. With SW enabled it will be fun to play around with it already. I would be eager to try and have some gambling sites enable LN deposits and withdrawals (if that's possible anyway because the "payment request" method seems more for deposits than withdrawals.) But I guess adoption will also depend if some LN wallet will be already noob-friendly by that time.

I would agree that everyone should know Gavin.. but I think that this reddit is also easy accessible for people who don't know that much about bitcoin. In that case it would be obvious to let them know a bit about Gavin in the parenthesis. I think you might be surprised by the number of people that don't know him. But maybe this info is a bit long though (I just copied the "introduction" that CoinDesk used :p)
And if you or anyone else wants to know.. CoinDesk is a new Bitcoin news website which started only 3 weeks ago. The owner is Shakil Khan (angel investor and advisor to Spotify.)

Pretty sure they made it 3 months after Segwit activation:


I kinda want to support segwit2x, but I don't still understand why they do some things this way. Why keep the slack private, why do most things (like the meetings etc) in private, why activate the HF after 3 months if they already agreed to 6 months (seems better), etc. At least they made Segwit properly compatible with current and BIP148, so that's a plus. Meh, still not sure.

No. I agree with your whole story/opinion. An easier way to help new adopters will be great, but if they don't know about Bitcoin yet, and they are not willing to learn about it, then they are definitely not willing to pay for support.
There are btw websites who try to simplify it, and I personally would refer people to:  which in my opinion is at least a bit easier to understand and looks more appealing than the Wiki pages for example ("for the average person".)
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:40:51
I am not sure what you are talking about. But you can exchange BTC for EUR (~0.2% fee) and withdraw it with SEPA transfers on Kraken (or BitStamp, but I believe Kraken has decent limits for non-verified.)
If you are accepting small bitcoin payments, it could be that you are actually talking about the bitcoin mining/transaction fee (which has nothing to do with Bitwala.) In that case you should simply use a much smaller fee and wait few days for such transaction to confirm on an exchange like Kraken.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:39:17
No, it doesn't say "1 BTC" it says "1 satoshi bitcoin" which makes it correct. But yeh you should never look for bitcoins on eBay anyway.
@_date: 2013-05-18 16:25:14
I understand what you are saying but I disagree.
If you are running a business, then you have employees, costs, etc. that you have to pay in USD. And besides that it's just too risky to have only bitcoins because the price can change from 260 to 55 dollar in a day. (of course we all hope it will be more stable soon and in the future)
It's a little bit the same like (probably) you, and most people, just put a part of their money into bitcoins and not literally all their life savings.


No, these users can still use bitcoins (and they will not lose money like if it's in PP) and Wordpress can just use an alternative of BitPay.
I think we should still be happy they accept bitcoins since it does create ways to use bitcoins and therefor make bitcoins more valuable.

Yes, well, I am sure it's much better than this Pascazi guy.
However, it does seem to give MtGox a lot of theoretically power. Let's say in 3 years their market share is dropped hard then I am wondering what they could theoretically do with this trademark right. If they could fight all the other exchanges because they use their trademark... damn :p

In Holland probably the fastest way to get BTC is through  (indeed by using iDEAL, the amount of BTC is listed before the payment and after the payment you get these in like few seconds) Obviously it is not really cheap. An alternative, also with iDEAL, is  which is around the same price, but the BTC is not fixed before payment.
The cheapest way is probably to "just" get verified by  and send money through SEPA. Or use an alternative exchange like  which also accepts SEPA. For MtGox the verification of identity is like 2 weeks I think. On BitStamp I think you should get the EUR in your BitStamp account after maybe 2-4 days.
So yeh, up to you, do you want it fast OR cheap ;)
And PayPal should be avoided by all times.
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:42:04
Did Montenegro join SEPA already? If you can make SEPA bank transfers, you should be able to use Kraken or BitStamp. (Obviously bank transfer will take few working days though.)
edit: they probably accept non-SEPA bank transfers too, but will be more bank fees unlike SEPA.. still probably cheaper if you making relatively big deposit.

I understand what you mean. But the volume is relevant. MtGox USD exchange had a 524.528.901 USD volume in last 30 days. This is only 1 exchange and only in USD. Imagine if the volume on these sites (eBay, Craigslist) is only a few 100.000 USD then it doesn't have much effect on the price IMO. But sure when bitcoins get more mainstream and easier to buy the prices will go up.
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:20:23
Well I could imagine you could have 2 target groups.
Traders who like a bit of extra competition, who probably prefer the 1 or .5 BTC.
And in my opinion also people who want to start trading and are still "practicing". A game like this would be a fun yet good way to learn it. I would qualify myself to that second group and unfortunately I cannot spend ~55 dollar a day in practicing with a game :p
But up to you how you will target it of course. Somehow dynamic "put your own" buy-in and get a possible price based on that would be perfect (IMO.) But a fair good algorithm for this might be hard.

Well first of all I appreciate every developer that is trying to make something for the Bitcoin community. And I like the idea of an embeddable ticker... but the way you do it now is just wrong.
You are using the HTML of  This has two problems:
1) the websites don't have a license for usage of this data.
2) you are forcing the visitors to download 120kb every 3.5 seconds. If I am using mobile internet with a limit of 300MB per month and this website is forcing me to download 1MB every 30 seconds because of some ticker, I would be pretty pissed.
Solution: use MtGox API right away ;) For example:  should give you the price in just 195 bytes. Documentation is here:

Idea is fun :) functionality looks good :)
Few suggestions:
Make it more clear that you just have to say if the price will go up or down. You guys are probably working for a while now on this project so it might seem obvious.. but I just looked for 3 minutes on the site to see what the idea is (do I have to pick a range or.. ?) So where it says "Bet on the rise of the bitcoin price in 3 hours" (I didn't really read that at first) put a big UP and DOWN arrow next to all that info. And put it in the header something like "BTC Oracle - Can you predict if the price will go up or down?" instead of "BTC Oracle - Gamble with skill (beta)". Actually a real nice header as image and without text which would show the idea in 1 second would be good. But I am no designer so not sure how you can do that good.
Also the only "big" bet I saw that won was 0.133742 btc but it was "denied". Which makes me think "oh noes why is it denied?" so some more info would be useful (like "cancelled by user", "bet too high", etc.)
But I am pretty sure I will try it :) I just hope you guys would make enough profit. It might seem like a coin flip but you would assume that sometimes a price change seems obvious.. but then again.. I might be wrong about that :p
edit: ah I assume now that the multiplier is modified based on the bets? That would work I guess.

Easiest is probably [BitPay]( They have a few advantages: you can convert to USD right away (no risk of price dropping) and they can just sent the money to your US bank account the next day. Also they have several plugins available for popular e-commerce software. Their fee is 0.99% which is much lower than creditcard and PayPal, however, accepting "native bitcoins" and using exchange is cheaper (around 0.6%)
[CoinBase]( has a similar service. Here you can also accept bitcoins for free (and don't convert to USD right away.)
Also [MtGox]( accepts merchants. I think withdrawing etc takes a bit long here though.
And you could also make your own system to generate an address for each transaction, show that to the user, check if they made the correct payment, send the bitcoins to an exchange and withdraw to your bank (or keep bitcoins :]) - but a payment provider is easier.

I assume you need "root permission" to use the GPU like that? No, thank you.
Your trading bot:  also has 0 points and some comments about being "suspicious" that you didn't reply to.
Just seems all a kinda odd. Too bad apktool is unable to decompile it somehow.

I found this interesting so I did some Googling.
A law attorney Michael Pascazi tried to get the Bitcoin trademark. MtGox fought this and was able to get the trademark.
In their official press release they said:

Lol, wtf, paying to reload a frame every 30 seconds pff? No, thanks.
You can also just use a [reload addon for Firefox]( on Bitcointalkforum. Even though I think these 4(?) hours can be easily achieved just by reading the forums in a normal way. Besides that you cannot "break out newbiejail" with this since you also need 5 posts.

For a good introduction to bitcoins I like to recommend: 
Honestly there is not really much to do with 1 USD of bitcoins, just like you cannot do much with 1 USD on the internet anyway (buying something physically with shipping costs etc is too expensive.) Cowboy_Coder names most things I guess.

There has been a research already that says 29,9 percent of the Bitcoin exchanges closes after 1 year. They made a list of 40 known Bitcoin exchanges and collected the following data: Exchange, Origin Dates, Active Daily vol., Closed?, Breached?, Repaid?, AML and Risk Ratio. The research was done by 2 university students.
See the research here:

Both bitcoinctf's as jordan314's reply should help you :) You have to think about the SQL query behind it, then think of the possible way of escaping‎ (or why jordan314's input creates an error.)
I got to say, I think, or maybe hope, that really no production site of the last few years have this escaping‎ function though :p

According to the [mining hardware comparison]( you get around 18-27 Mhash/s. By using the [calculator]( you will earn around 0.036413 BTC or **4.373918 dollar every month**. Considering that probably you parents will have to pay a bit more for electricity and your laptop has a bigger chance to be broken soon, I do not think it's worth it. Maybe just for fun as a test, but not to earn money.

Lol, what kind of "protection" is that? "*Yeh send me penny if it doesn't get stolen I am safe*", really?
Format &amp; reinstall your computer, put some proper antivirus &amp; firewall and don't download "*new wallets*" if you cannot read the source. Read: [Wallet Security Dos and Don'ts (Windows)](
edit: and I am sorry for your loss of BTC, hope you learned from it :X ;)

First of all, it is good to run NoScript! But it only solves 1 potential problem (basically: disabling Java, Flash and Javascript - which I do think is the most common way to get a virus which steals your wallet)
But of course there are still other ways to steal your wallet. For example: virus through warez or other download, by directly hacking into your computer, USB device from someone else, other browser plugin, etc.
I advice you to read: [Wallet Security Dos and Don'ts (Windows)]( and [Securing your wallet](
Basically if you have savings in Bitcoin which you don't need right away, consider a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-05-05 08:47:53
We should just all report it on:  (obviously do not download anything from this project!)
Something like this would work IMO:


So considering that stealing bitcoin wallets brings a lot of money and hackers try everything to steal it, then the name bitcoinqt and the obvious fake developer name, we can be pretty certain that this is a virus.
Please remove it as quick as possible, thanks.

What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-05-12 11:36:08
As I think you are trolling, I wish I could just say "ok cya".
But just in case you are not..
I am from NL (EU) but I currently live on the province in the Philippines. I see here many poor people who frequently don't have money to get food for their family. Here, there are simply no jobs, yet they try everything they can to still get some food (in a positive way I mean - like planting vegetables etc - no begging.)
I am sure in the USA there are much more job possibilities than here. Especially if your previous job was in an IT company.
You did this by yourself, you are the one who lost the money, but in the end it's just a mistake. Get your shit together, get a job and you can pay it in no time. Begging in this reddit is not going to help you.
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:40:23
Ah ok. Well when I said '*they are definitely not willing to pay for support*', I mean that the average person would not do that.
For example a nursery student who sees "bitcoins" on the news, start google-ing to it, sees *a lot* of information about it (even mostly technical) and decides to drop it. I think the "engagement" to bitcoin is not big enough that he/she would pay for support. I think this would be "the average person".
Now a manager in a media company that has read about Bitcoin on his technical blogs but never got into it yet. He might have the interest for it, is already more engaged because his company is related to technical improvements, but might not have the time to investigate about it. I do think that he/she could pay for such a service if all his answers can be answered.
So I do think it *could* work. But I think that such a target group won't be too easy to reach. And like I said, I don't think that's the average person (aka this group is *relatively* small.)

Ah ok. I also said that because i did see a file named 'root-test' in that apk. But from a technical point of view an android miner would be interesting actually.

My Avast virus-scanner gave a warning that it's a virus and disabled the site (so I didn't see it.)
But after looking better at it, it seems to be a scamming website. So you buy bitcoins there and they never give the coins yet keep your money or something. So I guess it is not a virus and I assume you are safe ;)
Still reading an article like: [Wallet Security Dos and Don'ts (Windows)]( could be useful. Obviously you should have a virus-scanner, keep your plugins up to date (imo most viruses are thru Java/Flash exploits), running something like NoScript can be good too.

But it's pretty fun so far! :)

Lol, why do people downvote Rotsor?
Ok. We roll a dice 1 - 10. With 1,2,3,4 you win, with the rest the house wins. So the house wins much more often right (60% - 40%)? Well yes, but only on the long run this is sort of statistically 'guaranteed'.
We roll 5 times. You understand you have the (small) odds to win more money after 5 times right? Even though the house has bigger odds than you. If the house is unlucky they can still lose. Especially if the house edge is even smaller than my example.
So setting up a gambling site is also little bit gambling and has definitely a risk. This is what Rotsor very much proved with the SatoshiDice stats. So you do need some money to start (that's why SD had shares I assume) and/or low limits so you can still pay it. And yes, in the long run you should make a lot of money (this is probably what you meant with 'guaranteed'.)

And these posts should be included in the "*Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins.*" rule IMO. Just get a job. Or learn something valuable that you can sell as a service. Bitcoins don't grow on trees.

You could also just compare the volumes of each exchange to see what the **real** share in the market of MtGox is... [Bitcoin Charts Markets](
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:34:33
And the idea of "*Try to get people to buy it from you! (Sending the site to your friends on Facebook, Twitter, forums etc is a good start)*" is just disturbing. How could you annoy your friends by asking them to be a bigger fool then yourself? I even get a bit of a "pyramid scheme" feeling with this, even though that might not be completely a good comparison.
And I do actually like to gamble sometimes, but I would never ever even consider to participate in a website like this.
I do like the fact that you made a website considering Bitcoin, and in functionality, design etc it looks all good. I just hope that your next (possible) project will be something else :p
@_date: 2013-05-25 02:23:47


That's not very professional at least :p Also "*We only charge .01BTC*" is very strange. There has to be some exchange from bitcoin to dollar/euro and therefor there should be also an exchange fee or something. Also I would assume the charge to be compared to the order (and amount.)
With all new bitcoin sites you have to be careful. I would personally suggest to try it first with a few dollars. So if you get scammed, it's not too much. If it's legit, it's good to have competition ([BitSpend](
