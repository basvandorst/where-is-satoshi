We have a superior military, and a commanding height advantage.

The property classification appears to make unduly complicated the use of bitcoin as a currency, for purchasing things. So when you buy a $2.00 cup of coffee using bitcoin, you are now required to compute gain/loss from the date you mined/purchased BTC to the date you purchased the coffee. 
Without some safe harbor or a very sophisticated tax accounting software linked to your bitcoin wallets, people who regularly use bitcoin could have hundreds of small computations like this to make. The compliance burden would be like using stocks or bonds to purchase goods on overstock. 
The Tax/Regulations panel discussed this problem at Coin Summit on Tuesday. As a newly-minted tax attorney who is also new to bitcoin this developing issue has been fascinating. Someone needs to develop compliance software to assist taxpayers.

ultimately $25 for a 12 ounce bag that I can buy for $12 down the street.

The US could mount a land-based invasion of China. We have the military might and height advantage....

Hi Freedom-d, 
Definitely a fan of the gourmet coffee. The flat rate works well for 5 bags but I tend to only order enough for a week or two. I wonder if any of the mail-order coffee companies ever looked into a subscription service to keep buyers on their coffee, supplying them a 12oz bag every week or two. That model would probably require relief from the flat rate shipping charge on each bag or it would be too high.
Wish you luck in your venture!

Regarding the sample letter, I don't believe West Virginia has ever been known as a hub of technology or intelligence, so I doubt Mr. Manchin would worry about damage a ban on bitcoin would cause to the West Virginia technology industry.

A US land-based invasion of the Chinese mainlaind seems to be the most logical solution.

These girls look like mongoloids. I prefer the bleached blonde San Fernando valley type for my porn.

Cool idea but $10.00 shipping seems steep for a 12 ounce bag of coffee that is already priced at $15.00

Re: point 2 - I've read a "bitcoin bank account" of sorts is in development that will allow a consumer to maintain a stable BTC-USD rate. In other words, the accountholder deposits $50 and holds in his account an amount of bitcoin that always equals $50, regardless of BTC fluctuations. 
So consumer shifts all or some risk of appreciation/depreciation to the "banker". This struck me as a great idea because it enables the currency function for average consumers. It might further adoption. Any news on this?
