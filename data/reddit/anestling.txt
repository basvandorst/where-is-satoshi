It's impossible to go over your limit in case of a credit card which means that it's impossible to lose all your savings because most people have their assets spread among different things, like a house, cars, credits, etc. etc.


Are we talking about criminal activities here? I'm sure as hell I've never had a single transaction using my plastic card which could be used against me in court. In fact all my spendings get texted to my cell phone immediately.

Most people have heard the word "ban". People are quite simple - for them that means they have to cash out immediately. If the ban is to be lifted, it will take quite a lot of time before and **if** these people decide to invest in Bitcoin again.


This has been a common sentiment for the past 8 years. *"Every year brings us closer to mass adoption"*, however take only your bitcoins on your trip and fly to a random country. What will be the chance you'll be able to successfully travel (i.e. buy food and shelter, use public transport or/and call a taxi, etc.) **without** first converting your bitcoins to the local currency? That's what mass adoption looks like in my book. And that remains a wet dream at the moment.

That still doesn't explain how miners manage to mine blocks with different transactions. Their equipment is working 24x7 - they cannot just get transaction from the mempool, sort and then start mining - they can easily mine the same transactions.

You can average down and buy more now. This way when the price increases you'll recoup your losses faster. Of course if the price goes higher which no one can predict.

A lot of people are in for a quick buck. Right. I mean, wrong, it's not what Bitcoin was intended to become. It was invented to become a decentralized currency which is not controlled by anyone.

Only when major countries like USA, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia *all* legalize Bitcoin, only then Bitcoin might become its own unit of valuation.

Most Chinese are already close to going to bed, so a lot of them will cash out tomorrow and in the coming days (the news reaches different people at varying speed).
Also the US traders are about to start trading and they will also panic. There's no "resistance" in bitcoin's price, other than in the heads of dreamers.
It will continue falling. I cannot say what the bottom will be but I guess it will be between $2000 and $3000. But that's a wild speculation.

@_date: 2017-09-13 18:53:13


It matters everything in the context of Bitcoin being or trying to be a replacement to fiat currencies. It's not and you've just proven that.


It's a lot easier to lose all your Bitcoins than to lose real money. If your credit card gets stolen, you call your bank and they block it and sometimes they even give you back the money which has been spent by a thief.
If your Bitcoin wallet gets stolen, you've lost your savings forever. That's another serious reason why people are scared of Bitcoin. There's no protection at all in case of a loss. Ethereum went as far as to create a hard fork to recover 100 million stolen ethereums. Do you think anyone will ever fork Bitcoin if 100K Bitcoins get stolen? That won't ever happen. And I'm sure there are people who own that much. Satoshi himself owns a million bitcoins. That's freaking 4 billion dollars.
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:58:07
That's correct. There is always a fee involved in sending bitcoins so you might ask him to send your bitcoins to your address at your favourite exchange, so that you won't have to pay twice to transfer bitcoins (first to your wallet and then to your exchange).
@_date: 2017-09-15 00:38:20
This is the worst possible time to buy Bitcoin. It hasn't settled yet and it's far from settling.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:47:54
Yes, many.
* People will be more wary of investing in crypto-currencies, thus hopefully such swings in valuation will become less frequent and less violent.
* Miners will stop buying GPUs and raise their prices unnecessarily.
* Bitcoin might become closer to becoming a fiat currency since every news outlet is now talking about this crash, and most people (&gt;95%) still haven't used Bitcoin ever. The more news coverage the more interest and adoption.

There are bitcoin addresses and there are numbers associated with them. These numbers are stored in the blockchain (a huge database of all transactions).


There's no mutation. It's an agreement in the bitcoin source code.

While exchanges might be banned everywhere, hand to hand exchange will never be banned. It's not physically possible unless we suddenly step into "1984".


You've just described what Bitcoin has been for the past 4-5 years. Its growth is solely due to relentless trading and groundless belief.

They are the reason Bitcoin has been overevaluated, they are the reason it's crashing now. We'd be all better off without them.
I for one want classic Bitcoin exchanges to die and localbitcoins to take their place. In this case we'll have something close to a real exchange rate, not something pumped by crazy traders.

It's been loud and clear - it's a complete ban. BTCC is shutting down completely at the end of this month.


That's a figment of your imagination. In fact many companies which allowed to purchase things using Bitcoin in the past, have since stopped supporting Bitcoin payments.

You can average down and buy more now. This way when the price increases you'll recoup your losses faster. Of course if the price goes higher which no one can predict.
Anyways, if you didn't know that when you invest your money in Bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency) you must be ready to lose it all, you need to know it now.

Currently the absolute most demand for bitcoins comes from traders (I guess over 90%). That explains why Bitcoin has such extreme swings in valuation. That also explains why the localbitcoins exchange (which actually trades bitcoins for money) doesn't set its own exchange rate but uses the one from Poloniex.
In the real world there's little to no demand for actual Bitcoins because it's still an asset (or a means of money laundering) and not currency.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:36:26
You know, they could simply send bitcoins. It's not like exchanges don't allow you to withdraw.

A lot of people are in for a quick buck. Right. I mean, wrong, it's not what Bitcoin was intended to become. It was invented to become a decentralized currency which is not controlled by anyone.

Only when major countries like USA, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia *all* legalize Bitcoin, only then Bitcoin might become its own unit of valuation.

The truth is *it already is* but you don't want to spook people that much by admitting that.

@_date: 2017-09-11 10:45:22
Nowadays Bitcoin blocks are extremely computationally expensive to compute. How do miners decide which transactions to include considering that bitcoin transactions also have varying fees? If I'm not mistaken blocks cannot include the same transactions.
How do unconfirmed transactions propagate in the BTC network? Is there a sort of protocol akin to Torrent? Where do unconfirmed transactions get stored? In RAM or bitcoind uses some temporary storage for them?
If I initiate two transactions with the same inputs but different outputs (and the same fee), and send them to two different bitcoin nodes, which transaction will be confirmed? Or will they both be rejected? ;-)
