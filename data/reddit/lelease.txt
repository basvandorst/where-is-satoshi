You're doing it wrong, you need an alt account for each arrow, then keep the account that ends up correct and throw away the rest of them.

Outages aren't global. Mostly isolated to one AZ or region.

If only there wasn't the 10k minimum balance

But what makes it worth 10%? Are these guys dabbling in some money-laundering on the side or something less than legal?

Why isn't anyone arbitraging TF out of this?

Is there any website where I can see hourly candles from the 2013 rally/crash? Cryptowatch only has data for weekly candles that go back that far

Just two questions:
1. What's stopping me from buying from the exchange and selling to them in an endless cycle? (Or why hasn't anyone else filled this arbitrage already? It sounds too good to be true, 3% profit each time)
2. If I sell to one of these guys, is it completely legal for me? Any "hidden risks"?

Now that there are blue bitcoins, does that dilute the value of red bitcoins, since the total number of coins available has increased? If so, why would anyone holding coins want UASF?

Serious question, which of those have you disproven for a fact? Or are you just saying that you can't imagine someone doing all this?
