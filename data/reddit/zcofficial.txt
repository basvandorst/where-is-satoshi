Many miners are claiming that the payouts are not as they expected. So they move to other pools where the reward is better. Check their Bitcointalk thread - you'll find more details there.

This looks like a bad Nigerian Prince scheme; 
Did anyone searched for the address? Anyone fell for that?

For a Tier 1 country, no. 
For a worldwide adoption, yes. If its 6% in USA/Canada its probably 10% in a East European one and around 15-20% in African countries.

Got it, thanks for clarification!

You can use Preev.com's website and set the GBP from there. I wouldn't install an app only for that.

So you say Bitcoin's slowly becoming another type of cash that will need to be stored in a bank from where bankers will take fees and ultimately have control over it? 
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:55:02
As the idea, that's amazing. 
But the fees, man. The fees are not worth paying for it. We're still 10-20 years back until the ATMs will have decent fees - not more than 2%.

A new December 2017 - probably never. 
Steady increasing over time with value being added by the technology, adoption and other valid points while not growing because of people manipulating the price? Between 6 months to one year.

This is perfect. 
Right before Bitmain's IPO. Purely perfect. 
@_date: 2018-09-27 15:12:03
Wasn't the Bitcoin's purpose to get rid of the banks? To offer a new way of exchanging value without going to a bank? Really curious what would happen if they would get hacked.

There comes a generation that will see mining as 'crypto mining'. 
Times are changing.

A bit fun. Only a bit. 
But we should go on with our own things and not give so much attention to this guy. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:58:11
If crypto would found a way to control everything, they would find a way to control crypto. my 2 cents
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:49:31
Good idea, but there will be issues. 
For example, a hacker is stealing a large amount of BTC then goes full on XMR or another privacy cryptocurrency. How can we track that? 
Another example: You send a large amount of cash from the BTC blockchain to another cryptocurrency one - let's say Electroneum. Right in that moment, they have a 51% attack on that blockchain and your funds are at risk. 
There are even more cases like this. Its a great idea, but practically - we're too early.

Depends on too many factors, you can't have an opinion based on the facts that we know now for 2 years ahead. Let's wait and see 
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:45:49
I heard this so many times in the last years that I actually start to believe those. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:29:59
This is how people felt in the past about the price too. And it will probably happen again. Stay focused and increase adoption, price will follow in the future years! 
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:42:39
Don't think so, but surely someone will make it available for Open Office soon! Give it a bit of time

Bitcoin works on a blockchain protocol. More about them  [here]( 
It has a limited number, as after a certain block the reward will be 0. That's not something we need to worry - this won't happen too soon ( around 2104). 
So in total, there will be only 21,000,000. From which a big amount is either lost or locked in accounts that cannot be recovered too soon. 
There's nothing stopping someone from selling half of satoshi - except the fact that its not possible to do such a low value transaction - yet. But in the future, there might be. Depends on how valuable Bitcoin might be. Right now, the lowest part of a Bitcoin is called satoshi and its value is 0.00000001 BTC. More details about Satoshi can be found on [99bitcoins]( or [coinguides](

Cryptopanic have a public API available, afaik. 
You can also check the CryptoCompare one and the Faws.com - not sure if they have an API. 
Hope it helps, good luck!

Jamie Dimon and Roger Ver, wow - Google went full retard. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:21:33
Nope. Noope. It won't. 
Why is there so much buzz with this ETF? I remember the days when the biggest issue was China banning crypto.

I think its better to start the other way around. Create a plan and get feedback from the community. No one probably have time to tell you how to do your job - or in this case, your exchange. Feedback should be asked when you have something, not only an idea. my2cents.

There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's Bitcoin.

Disagree with you here. 
Creating an address is the first step towards adopting cryptocurrency. I remember when someone asked if he can pay me in BTC for a gig back in 2013. I created an address, got paid and watched how those BTC would worth more over the next months. And then I learned how to transfer, trade, purchase other cryptocurrencies. 
It all starts with an address and understanding how the system works.
