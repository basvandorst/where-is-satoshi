Have you seen the bitcoin spikes in the past? The correction takes time. It will come. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:31:21
This is quite possibly the worst time for that to happen. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:47
Cheap coins? I sold at the peak.
You'd better go start selling chap. She's heading down to 6k.

Jesus Christ this subreddit is the biggest circlejerk I've ever witnessed.
Is there an for adults?

What the fuck are you people basing this on?
Every time bitcoin has a spike like this it's all over the news and then within a week it slides right back down. Then it stabilizes for a few months... Until another peak like this happens.
Do you all honestly believe in this TO THE MOON shit?
I'm investing a lot in btc and I'm confident it will continue to grow... But this 100k in 2018 bullshit... What the fuck?
My opinion based on the past is that bitcoin will tank in the next 3 to 4 days down to $6000-6500. Then it'll remain and slowly grow until feb/March... Where it will pick up momentum again, and head towards 18k.

Coinbase must declare details of anybody moving over 20k usd so they can be taxed etc
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:59:20
Everybody always bigs up bitcoin like this this amazing new technology that isso anonymous and so instant etc.
Then shit like this happens.
So you avoid coinbase, maybe use gdax? Ha! Better have your passport, driving license, photo ID, name, address, date of birth, bank details, photo and access to your camera, employer, role at employer, registered business interest etc etc
Anonymous and fast my arse. What a joke �� 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:13:11
I second this. OP is the most reasonable person I've seen on this entire sub. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:31:34
Gotta look after my boy with all you bullies around. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:10:19
Where the fuck were you in 2007.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:05:47
Don't read the comments in this sub. People will ALWAYS say buy buy buy hold hold hold because they want their own investments to grow.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:39:35
None of them are reliable yet. This is all unpredicted. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:16:18
I'm counting on it! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:02:52
I hope people new to bitcoin are not listening to your bullshit comments.
I'm beginning to think this subreddit is filled with circlejerking bots trying to talk good about bitcoin so that others keep buying and their own savings grow.
Financial markets are brutal but shit. This is evil. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:00:06
But derp bitcoin derp so fast and anonymous... Fail
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:33:50
Honestly I think it'd make people panic even more. I'd be shitting my pants if I didn't cash out 8hrs ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:42:17
My understanding is that coinbase is an easier interface for casual buying and selling. Gdax is the backbone.

Trump is president.
The UK voted out of the EU.
North Korea are actually threatening the US with legit nukes.
A dude on the internet just eat one of his balls because he promised he would do it, based on the price of a theoretical magical internet stock market.
I'm pretty sure I'm in a coma and my brain is just making this shit up... Because this CANNOT be the real world. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:09:30
You are absolutely right. This sub is a dangerous place. I got out a few hours ago. The correction is coming. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:26
�� EVERYBODY PANIC!! �� 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:11:35
Neither of those points contradict what I'm saying, because both are required in order for bitcoin to work.
It's not anonymous if you need to be known by the exchange, and it's not reliable if the exchange can't handle the traffic. One of the biggest, in fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:01:47
Not to mention people getting ready to sell up based on the IRS news. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:46:43
Dude you should ask your parents to look after your money.
