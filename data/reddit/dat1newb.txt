It would be cheaper to process than purchasing with fiat, allow for smaller transactions (&lt;$5)

I'm not spending all of it. I gotta have some sort of savings. :P

@_date: 2014-11-02 19:51:45
Thanks man! Tip tip hooray!

No idea. Save it, or buy a new computer from newegg. Who knows. That's the beauty of it. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:21:38
Yea, I would have waited too to ensure the system is working. Best of luck to your father! 
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:38:54
This is inspiring me to bug every small business in my area to accept bitcoin. Hard to compete with all the franchises around.
@_date: 2014-11-02 01:38:52
Of course :) Ain't no one stealin' my bits.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:18:00
Well it's not taking advantage at all. It's just owning both writing rights &amp; distribution rights. If you tried to sell music you released on the label on your website, I'm sure the label would expect a cut of those earnings. If you produce everything yourself, you technically don't need a label. Only thing they can provide is exposure and distribution to outlets. I feel in the future, the artists/musicians will become more self-sufficient.

@_date: 2014-05-20 20:49:29
I really want to start talking to businesses in my area (Santa Clarita) to accept BTC. All we have in our town are franchises, so it maybe difficult to get them to accept it. Guess it's up to the small, independent businesses to take the charge.
@_date: 2014-05-20 20:25:15
When transactions get too small for bitcoin, here comes dogecoin to the rescue. Lets become trillionaires in dogecoin :P
@_date: 2014-06-13 22:38:02
If I sell all my GHS on CEX and move it to Petamine, I'll be getting more power for my BTC. That sounds like a deal!

How does this compare with Coinffeine? 
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:09:03
This wouldn't happen with bitcoin. That is how it's relevant.
@_date: 2014-05-13 22:33:55
Didn't mean to limit it only to bitcoin. An alt coin would work better to avoid too many decimal places. Just the idea of using cryptocurrency for in-game transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:05:22
Well no, bitcoin's transactions aren't a pull-type transaction (credit). You wouldn't need a third-party to be the middle-man. Apple Pay could only act as a payment processor for bitcoin (conversion to USD, GDP etc.), but BitPay and Coinbase already exist.
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:31:51
Pretty sure they are sponsored by BFL. I guess they are giving away most of the money then.
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:03:00
That's a good price, but the 5 year contract scares me.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:24:28
Xapo charges 0.12% a year for insurance/vault service. $100 = 12 cents a year
@_date: 2014-05-13 22:58:02
Yes that's the thinking! A sponsorship would work, or make it pay to play so there will be more opportunity for rewards.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:49:25
Great point. It's like those credit card commercials that slammed people who used cash because it took forever. There definitely needs to be something scan-able. Maybe use QR codes?
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:03:40
Of course, I'm not telling anyone they should do it my way. As a user, I can't stand ads, so I don't seem them as effective nor do I want them on my videos. If a content creator wants ads on his content, he can do as he wishes. :)
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:33:20
Ahh I see. It really is a brilliant idea! More and more industries need to be decentralized.
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:42:11
Hmmm, 180 GH/s for $249, or 10 GH/s for $299... decisions decisions...
@_date: 2014-06-05 05:40:09
I actually LOL'd. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 20:56:33
So true. I have GHS in cex.io, waiting to obtain enough to sell and pick up my own antminer. If there is a smiliar service that offers better pricing, I'm all ears. suggestion is $1 cheaper per GHS.
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:41:58
Buying about $20-$50 worth every paycheck. I started buying in when it was around $800 a pop (late-January). I'm not concerned about the price, as that will always change. I just love the idea that I have total control of my funds. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:41:59
Hmm that's about $1/GHS. Better than Cex.io which is about $4.60/GHS! 
@_date: 2014-10-22 21:14:37
That, I feel, is going a step backwards with bitcoin. You're giving up control of your funds to a third-party for the ease of making transactions. Xapo is an example of that, except their cards don't work in the US, despite being a US company. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 06:24:33
I wonder how much YouTube's take would be when you want to withdraw. Screw that, accept bitcoin, send it to my personal wallet, problem solved.
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:35:45
Yea, the name is hard to pronounce. I find myself saying "Coinfiend". The idea is spot on, though.

@_date: 2014-06-07 20:17:48
That's awesome! I really want to switch completely over to bitcoins, but no one in my area (Santa Clarita) accepts them. Probably because we have a ton of franchises. Not many small business that are tech-savvy either. Also no one around here really knows about it. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 02:23:48
Hahahahaha! My thoughts exactly.
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:10:15
Correction, they do have fees now on trading. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:32:02
Unfortunately for you, I quit e-cigs about 5 months after I quit smoking regular cigs. I will definitely recommend your business to bitcoin vapers. :)
@_date: 2014-05-20 19:32:33
Pretty much the feeling of owning BTC :)

I use a Mac, so I put the wallet backups in a .dmg and lock it with a password. Mine is just an 8g.

I hope you practice safe security! Otherwise, to the moon!
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:52:54
Do they have the same prices? Most cloud services offer contracts which, I feel, are more expensive than buying individual GH/s. Once I save up enough money, I will get my own miner and point it away from Ghash.io.   Antminer S1s were cheap but they sold out. :(
@_date: 2014-11-02 19:49:53
Great idea. Here some bits to give to someone who wants bits. :P 100 bits @_date: 2014-06-08 07:11:15
Haven't had problems yet. I'll let you know if I have to bust out the fire extinguisher.

They are saying it while trying not to say it. Oh the irony. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:44:23
I'm not that rich, lol.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:18:13
Oh it is, just some people are nervous about it since they are unfamiliar with it.
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:57:33
So this sounds like something to be worked out in the future. I could see alt coins developed for games, maybe with faster transaction processes to suit faster paced games. 
This could be an opportunity for new, up-and-coming game developers to create games with cryptocurrency in mind. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 17:16:59
I no longer monetize my videos on YouTube anymore, I just plop a BTC address for donations. It may not be the same profits, but I'd rather not have my videos infested with ads.

many thanks bitemperor almighty.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:01:47
YES!! Next step is to completely produce an album without the labels help. Then you can get 200% (writing rights &amp; distribution rights) of the proceeds! Soon, musicians won't need labels.
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:31:41


Thank you! :D Hopefully sometime in the near future.

Yea, once they see they can immediately exchange for fiat to avoid volatility risk, it should be a easy decision. Also, they can't argue with free press from the BTC community. :) 
@_date: 2014-05-20 21:46:28
I never keep more than 10% of my BTCs in my webwallet (blockchain.info). This is the reason I got into BTC, to be my own bank.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:55:34
This seems like a much better platform than CEX. If earnings from PETA are reinvested into the hashing power, and everyone's shares' hashing power increases, cloud miners wouldn't have to reinvest their own earnings in more hash power to compensate for the rising difficulty. I do that with CEX and I feel it's costing me more. I would much rather have shares, and have the power of each share increase on the back end.
@_date: 2014-07-17 23:56:25
