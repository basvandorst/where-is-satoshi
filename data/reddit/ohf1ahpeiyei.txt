You're probably going to be hiring from the bitcointalk forums somewhere. It depends largely on luck and budget as much as anything else. I personally wouldn't even know where to start on a brief like that.

"Discus fish", if anybody was curious.

There will be one day. Not today though.

Doing as you wrote isn't sensible or possible. BIP32 solves the problem you describe though, letting multiple parties generate the same keys using a formula. Remember that funds usually only stay at an address just once. Saving a private key on it's own would be incredibly foolhardy.

Yes. Transactions do not contain a date. You can force them to only be valid after a certain time or block number, but that's the only limit chronologically. 


No. Changing the inputs, size and outputs would invalidate the signature.

Sort of bad for your privacy too.

Not to mention, I can buy 256 IP addresses quite easily.

Correct. Internally Bitcoin doesn't care about balances of addresses, it just tallies the individual inputs of a transaction. 
Imagine this sequence:
* 1 BTC &gt; `1address`
* 0.5 BTC &gt; `1address`
Logically we would say that I want to spend 1.5BTC from `1address`, but we don't. We want to spend 1 BTC and we also want to spend 0.5 BTC. They're different transactions so treated as different inputs. If you made a signature just spending the 1 BTC input, there's no way of adding the 0.5 BTC one to the transaction without making another signature.

Nope. Any properly generates number "works" for a private key, there's no real chance of it being wrong. There's a small invalid range, but nobody would so unlucky as to ever hit it.

I'm sure the happy people on freenode's  would be able to give you some pointers as well. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:42:37
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:29:24
No, that wouldn't work. The signature is unique in balance and input hash. Changing inputs would invalidate the transaction. Otherwise I could modify a transaction going to me to be spending far more than the signer intended!
@_date: 2014-01-12 21:35:11
No need. You learned something new and didn't take offence at me correcting you. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 11:58:14
Of course not. Even if it was, you can buy raw mining power more cheaply than the price they advertise anyway.

You're probably going to need a very competent programmer who has specific knowledge of bitcoin. There's a lot of very specific pieces of information you need to know to be able to interface with the network properly. Companies like Bitpay have had success hiring directly from the core programming pool, but there's also a lot of non-core skill around. You'll be needing some serious trust in your developer/s too, they literally hold the keys to your money for the life of the site. 
Building a site like this isn't a weekend job, or something that can be done in a fortnight. The backend is straightforward enough, if a little time consuming. Making it secure is another matter. This is not a small venture and can not be undertaken by a random person on a freelancing website. You also need to be prepared for what happens if and when your service is compromised, attacks are frequent and often devastating in the Bitcoin sphere.
