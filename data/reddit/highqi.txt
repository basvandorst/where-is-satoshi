make your own decisions.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:29:31

@_date: 2017-12-11 02:47:53
Whatever, we've all done it.  I sold at 14800 earlier and rebought at 15500.  It's no big deal.  Shit happens.
Just tell her to buy or sell and leave the computer alone.

Wow.  I recently made a deposit less than a week ago and it cleared via ACH.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:37
Alright...making money is getting too easy.  I'm suspicious.

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:41:19
no shit lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:38:33
lol, I have to walk away.  I've been in the space awhile, but still can't help myself from panic buying and panic selling @ market.  
See ya in a few hours.  Best of luck traders.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:06:20
I think people are mainly concerned with getting the money back out, not in.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:05:36
Man, some of you guys are pretty heartless.  This is a substantial amount of money and it's an issue.  I don't really think it matters how busy they are.  For someone moving that amount of capital, you make time to complete the requests after 8 days.  Downvote me all you want, but if I was this guy, I'd be pissed.
To be fair though, I probably would have liquidated from a more "reputable" exchange if it was an available option to him.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:58:33
flip a coin
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:30:02
despite what anyone here will tell you, it's definitely possible.  is it likely though after all this exposure?  probably not

Fair enough.  Perhaps what I meant was an insured exchange if possible due to nationality and region.
Obviously not all of the $ would be insured, but you get the point.

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:24:51
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:26:32
why?  because your order is at 17k?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:14:24
[SPECULATION]: 
Personally, I think a lot of people got burned in the last major market drop and some are even more pissed at how delayed Coinbase/GDAX's services are.  As a result, a lot of people are filing chargebacks and thus Coinbase/GDAX got listed as fraudulent.
