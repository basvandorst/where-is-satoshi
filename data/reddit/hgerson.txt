1. I disagree, if the computer is permanently offline, and the printer also offline, I believe it is safe!

1. All value is perceived, wine, art, real estate, or gold. The common denominator is if something is rare. A bitcoin has value because it cannot be counterfeited, it cannot be mass produced, it's creation is based on a math process that no single entity controls.
2. When a bitcoin is created through the math process it is called mining, and it is based on a process called a hash.
3. Don't over think it, the Bitcoin network is basically like the gift card network. It only has value where it is accepted. Which is at merchants like Dell, Microsoft, Overstock and more. Its value fluctuates like corn or soy beans because it can be traded like a commodity.
4. Finally, the record keeping system of each Bitcoin transaction is recorded in a ledger called the Blockchain. But this ledger is public and a record cannot be modified.
Bitcoin matters because all merchants deserve a payment method that is perfectly secure. All currency can be counterfeited, and all credit/debit transactions can be reversed by the consumer and the merchant bares all of the cost of a reversal. Only bitcoin is perfectly secure, zero fraud, zero risk!

It enables a merchant to collect cash and dispense Bitcoin without having to own any hardware or BTC. The only requirements are wifi in the store and a bank account for settlement. Happy to talk by phone and answer your questions. Howard Gerson Mobile-Currency.com
