Yeah good question but I’ve been downvoted to fuck.
I’m all in on BTC but I like to hear counter arguments
Obviously the Reddit hivemind vagina slush pool can’t handle it and downvote
Thanks for the considered reply

What scenarios could conceivably reduce Bitcoin to zero?
-	the Blockchain gets hacked?
-	excessive U.S. regulations (Iranian style) means no one can spend Bitcoin or get it switched to fiat 
-	a “better” crypto coin gets released (the Facebook to MySpace scenario)
-	any others?

I’m not sure if this is the same documentary (it’s not a Vice documentary) but it has enough of the same elements, I think this was the one he refers to

Why did they close?
And what happened to people’s coins stored with Armory once they closed ?

Your take on a 2024 halving price of $333,333 is interesting.
What do you think is the projected USD price of 1BTC  in this halving (2020) and why?

Does anyone have any informed opinion that show what was happening to the price of BTC in the run up to the last halvenings?
I read that the price flatlines about 3 months before as the “price increase” gets built in and then surges 6 months after.
Anyone know why?

Hold up a sign in a major Crypto city (San Francisco) saying “will give blowjobs for Bitcoin.”
You will get there in end buddy good luck.

Slightly OT , but if I wanted to bring an energy drink to market in Europe how would I go about it?
-	bottle design
-	manufacturing (China?)
-	distribution 
I’ve got a great ingredient from a Far East country which AFAIK has never been used in an energy drink before and taste really good

What’s the best solution right now for businesses that want to accept Bitcoin but don’t want to use Bitpay?
Or have an instantaneous conversion to currency? Just get paid and keep bitcoin?

Do you understand what’s behind the sentiment that causes the pump 6 months AFTER the halving?
I understand a pump a few months before because of traders anticipating a pump but not why every time there’s been a pump a few months after

Hypothetical scenario.
Let’s say you could sell half of your BTC stack right now and bank a $1 million after taxes.
You sink all the dollars into an index fund and withdraw a 4% S.W.R. annually ($40,000 in year 1 but increases as the market grows). You and your family could live comfortably on that. 
The rest of the stack you leave in your Ledger for the rest of your days.
Would you do it?
Or keep 100% in BTC?

Could you not send the BTC through a coin mixing service and get “clean” BTC from the other end.
The take the clean BTC to an exchange for LTC
Then take the LTC to a *second* exchange and swap for BTC.
Hey presto! Brand new coins and no link back?

What makes you think that a $40k bitcoin will be a fundamental change in the market?
Not trying to start an argument, genuinely curious what it is about the step from $20k to $40k that you think is so hard?
If you have said $100k to $500k I would have said sure. But I think $10k to $100k by next halving is quite likely

What’s currently the best way to cash out large amounts of BTC without alerting the authorities?
Asking for a friend?
@_date: 2019-04-01 14:06:11
Best answer by far. 
It’s a Western Union killer.
25 cents to send billions all over the globe within minutes, sitting at home in your underwear with a plastic glove in your mouth and a pig wearing lipstick sitting in your lap

I want to find a comment inside a post from the last 72 hours
In it a Redditor posted a very interesting hypothesis that the banks might be attempting to derail Bitcoin.
The post was structured something like this
-	Banks buy Bitcoin at spot price
-	Banks wrap Bitcoin in futures
-	Retail clients bet against futures
-	Bitcoin is being destroyed
It was something like that but more elegant and not gibberish like I spouted 
I should have saved the comment and come back to it later, it really highlighted a fantastic technique to centralise and destroy Bitcoin if a large bank like Goldmans deemed it a threat and wanted their own coin to be launched instead next year
Could anyone point me to the comment ?

I remember in the previous bullruns, the major mainstream media had multiple articles weekly about Bitcoin (CNN, BBC, The Economist etc) and this in turn caused the general public to start talking about it.
One car forum I’m a member of posted that his entire office was only talking about Bitcoin in Dec 2017. I was also on a train journey and two suited businessmen were trying to educate each other about BTC
Could this be the start of the next upswing?

Could you explain what this quote means in this context ?

If you had to guess, what price do you think we’ll get to by next year’s halving
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:37:29
What about the halvening next May 2020?
Do you think the price will be factored in 3-6 months before so that on that date not much will happen
I also heard there’s data showing 6 months AFTER the last halvenings there’s been another bull-run
Also does anyone know the date of the next halvening after 2020?
