I have about $10K coming in next Tuesday. I will probably buy 4-5 coins if the price remains low. I currently have 9.

Yo, your friend here, not the "TAX ATTORNEY", hey...
The government will never find out if you have bought and sold bitcoins for profit or loss. Do not report them on your "earnings". This is what we call a rich man's tax loophole. This is pretty much Cayman Islands. They can't come after you. Do not let this guy scare you.

He is a Senator from West Virginia. 
I think he has a lot more to worry about with regulating the coal industry and making sure his constituents have clean water and aren't abused by the mining industry. 
But, that will never happen, so he wants to go after something he has no idea about.

I bought back at around $360, so I still have some catching up to do. I decided to sit out this round of buying, but the bounce has been nice. 
I wonder if some large holder was trying to test the market?
@_date: 2014-10-02 18:57:39
There is obviously a lot of sell pressure from people buying from retailers who instantly convert BTC sales into $USD. 
In essence, when you buy from a retailer (that does not hold BTC), you are selling/shorting BTC.

He didn't really "own" the anchor. These are normal Ron Paul talking points about how the dollar is a bad store of value and he sprinkles in a little Bitcoin here and there.

The adoption of retailers of accepting is causing the price to fall: it makes sense if you think of the retailer instantly converting to $USD after taking your BTC.
In essence, purchasing from a retailer is like selling your BTC if the prices are in $USD and they are converting instantly to $USD.
Of course, in the long run, retail adoption will be a positive. This will drive more consumers to purchase BTC which will drive up the price. It is all about getting a consumer base that wants to buy into and invest in BTC. I do not believe most companies (large ones) want to take that type of volatility risk.

I have spending money in Coinbase (I find it easier and like the app).
I have moved a majority of my coins to a paper wallet.
After seeing so many services fail, I am wary of holding a majority of my coins through an intermediary. Although, I feel like Coinbase is one of the most responsible and respectable services for purchasing/selling BTC.

Thinking of taking a buy position today. I don't see a catalyst for growth at this point pending any news. We could see that sell-off to $600 for sure, I think I will monitor and make a buy around the $615 mark if we hit that in the next few days.

I bought @ 75 and then at $105 / $110 during the Silk Road crash. Happy. :)

4 hours on my first e-mail (July11), we were back and forth for a few days. 
The final resolution happening 2 days before they refunded my money to my bank account (July 15) and honoring my original 9 BTC purchase on July 5. The coins appeared in my account on July 16.

I would exit at this level as well. After this rush of buying passes through, people are going to sell.  It will probably hit $108 and then fall over the next week or two.
@_date: 2013-07-18 14:25:55
I had a similar experience that was resolved after multiple email communications: 
I had purchased 9 BTC @ 71 on July 5.  ($655)
They cancelled my order on the settlement date on July 11 (now worth $870 or so), then were refunding my money to enter my bank account on July 17 ($655). 
After a couple e-mails back and forth with customer service they had agreed to whitelist my account and eventually honor my original transaction on July 5, 2013. (they had already received the money from my bank account).
Overall, if you have an issue with Coinbase, and are reasonable, they seem to care and will resolve the issue! (I did not have to tweet at them to get extra attention)
Kudos to Coinbase, I am now a believer.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:02:59
I just bought some more BTC @ $801 on Coinbase.
My prior buying points were @ $75, and @ $105 during the SilkRoad crash. I will take the opportunity to buy more during the "China" crash.

I bought about 10 coins at 68, which is not much. Hey, my odds  are probably a lot better with bitcoin than gold or the stock market at this point. Plus the transaction fees for buying are MUCH less than buying hundreds of dollars of stock.

Received a reply. No increased time to have my refund processed. Still have to wait a week.
Olaf replied:
Hi, sorry for the confusion on that. It looks like your transaction was canceled due to appearing high risk, and a refund has been sent to your bank account.
I'm sorry for the trouble! I can appreciate how frustrating that must be. I've whitelisted your account - this means your transactions will no longer be flagged as high risk. You shouldn't have any problems going forward.
Again, my apologies for any undue stress this has caused you!

Of course Coinbase will be offering the "instant transfer" right as the price goes up. 
Trust me, when the price is down back to the 60s and 70s, magically, "instant transfer" will have technical problems and you will not be able to buy.
I believe Coinbase manipulates/cancels orders when it is advantageous to their bottom line. 
They are unloading BTC to you at higher values.
EDIT: Ready for down votes because of the fan-boy love for Coinbase.

I just want to get this out, I am contacting them. They have no reason to cancel my order when my funds have gone through days before the settlement of the BTC trade. 
I will update with any resolution from customer service.

@_date: 2013-07-11 18:57:55
I wonder if there are more cancellations of orders when the price rises from the time of purchase to settlement.

It seems rather convenient that they start the "INSANT" transfer when the price is over $90.
I am sure the instant transfer will be broken/unavailable when the price is at a price where you should actually buy. (50s-70s)
Coinbase is unloading BTC at a high price to you so they have much less risk. Good luck trying to buy instantly at a lower price.

You didn't have money in your account. Your fault.

I feel like Gyft is the ultimate way to cash out your BTC for retail use. Plus, if you are using Coinbase, you also are saving an extra 1% in fees from converting BTC into USD.

All it said was my order was cancelled. They money was sent to Coinbase on 07/08/2013 from my bank. I now have to wait until 07/17/2013 for the money to be back into my bank account.
They cancelled only a couple hours before the coins were to appear in my account.

Nvidia cards are horrible at mining. Not worth the power consumption for the low hash rate. 
Heck, you could put in an AMD 7770 for $80 and get 240Mhash.
