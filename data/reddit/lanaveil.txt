@_date: 2019-03-29 14:57:45
They are not the first ones, are they? If I'm not mistaken, there were some US states that wanted to accept crypto taxes payments

Yeah, when it drops too much people are just scared it's the end of the story. It's like the truth is somewhere in between psychology.

You should have done it when the price was significantly lower :(

Well-written but it was not so hard to guess back then in 1995. Everything was going the way that led us to our present destination.

Always think first and make your own decisions. I've never felt being a part of the crowd. 
Thanks for sharing! Will check!

That's a curious example to show what an animal nature is prevailing in all if us and we should fight it to be more human. Would be more interesting to see the same experiment on people, it would be more precise. I bet there are some of them released to public already, came across something like this on BBC section. 
As for the experiment itself, even if this one never took place, there were many similar ones you can google. 
What would I say to the scientists in this case? Just stop making experiments on animals.

Bank is just another representative and mediator, they can be the same scammers as anyone else.
I don't know why people think the banks are eternally solid, stable and are the guarantors to be fully trusted.

If you've ever posted your personal information anywhere, you shared it with the ones you can't even imagine. 
Even, our mobile phones, our IPs etc can tell a lot of us so if you keep on thinking about that you are likely to go mental.
