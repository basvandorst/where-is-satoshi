Using their own code to verify the data they sent is kind of pointless. If you really care about "provably fair" then you really need to write your own client and do the verification with code that you trust instead of some obfuscated/compressed JS code hosted by the site (

How exactly is this "fighting" big tobacco? You're still buying cigarettes and they're still making money.
The discount you get from this site isn't much. A pack of Marlboro Reds will cost about the same from this site as they do in Kentucky, USA. This site just lets you avoid the excise task, which goes to the state government, not to the tobacco companies.

Uber gives free rides to pretty much any event. It doesn't take much to get them involved and it doesn't mean they support your cause.

The problem is that 95% of people who use Tor are using it for the wrong reason or have a total misconception of what it's for.
It provides no security. It doesn't provide real anonymity. The ONLY thing it does is mask your source IP address, that's it. The trade-off is that you're routing your traffic through a known hostile network.
If your traffic isn't 100% encrypted, you are fucked. If you don't pay attention to certificate warnings, you are fucked. If the site you're connecting to is compromised, you are fucked. If your browser has any security vulnerabilities, you are fucked. Tor doesn't add security, it removes security and adds a tiny bit of anonymity. 
It's a huge problem that people get a false sense of security from using Tor. How may people are going to end up in prison over the recent darknet busts when they thought Tor was keeping them safe?
Tor doesn't need compromised to be dangerous, it already is dangerous even if it works 100% as advertised and has no vulnerabilities. A false sense of security means there are plenty of other weak links in the chain that governments/criminals can exploit to target Tor users.

Napster was shut down because they were sued, it had nothing to do with the government going after them.
The government is going after places like Silk Road because there are actual federal crimes happening there.
You can't really compare one to the other.

I wouldn't exactly call ASICs a young industry. ICs have been around since the early 1960s. The technology has been increasing rapidly (Moore's law, etc), but it's still super expensive to have a chip fabricated. It's still not possible for someone to do from home and it won't be for a while. ASICs are still very much a niche market, most people have no need to print out a custom chip. There's not enough scale of demand to ever make it cheap.
Compare that to another "young industry", 3D printing. The basic modern 3D printing technique was invented in the 80s and it's already possible for people to order custom 3D printed parts online or even buy a 3D printer to use at home. That's because 3D printers are generally useful to a wide range of people.
Maybe someday we'll see companies print out custom ASICs for cheap, but I doubt we'll ever see cheap desktop ASIC fabricators. There's just no demand for it.

5000 signatures on a petition doesn't mean anything. Internet petitions are pure slacktivism.
Having 5000 people personally email Amazon customer support about bitcoin would have a bigger impact, but that requires that people actually do more than clicking a button. Even if you asked people to do that, they'd still say "do you have a form letter I can send?"

So this dude is CEO of a company that employs like 5 people at most, but he has no idea where his money is or where it's going? Even if he isn't an outright scammer, he sounds like the worst CEO ever.
Oh well, at least he can change his name and start over again!

This is pretty much a non-story that affects nobody. No one cares. The BFL story was way bigger than this and got zero mainstream media coverage.

This isn't "the Google Campus", it's "Campus London". It's an incubator for tech startups that Google founded:
Startups pay money to rent desks there and have access to educational and mentorship programs. It's not a building where Google employees to go to work.

I did that too. I read the whitepaper when it was posted to Slashdot and ran the mining client on my PC for a few weeks. Lost interest. Reformatted/reinstalled the OS a few times after that.

What kind of support do you think money would provide them?
Asking for an easy way to donate money for a cause, just to show support, is about as slacktivist as filling out on online petition. You click a button, your money disappears, and you feel better about yourself, but there's no guarantee that your money is actually helping the cause you think it is.
If you actually care about the HK protesters, you should first ask what they need, then ask how to get it to them.

As a software engineer at a big firm who frequently meets with intellectual property attorneys, NEVER READ A SOFTWARE PATENT.
It might sound like a good idea to read a patent to make sure you're not infringing on it, but unless you're an IP lawyer, you can't really tell. If some shitbag patent troll company ends up buying the patent and suing you, and they can prove that you read the patent, the damages you have to pay will be much worse because it's considered "willful infringement".
The safest thing to do is just write your software, ignore patents, and hire an IP lawyer if you get a C&amp;D.

Their problem isn't with the existence of encryption, it's having the encryption enabled by default without being able to get the key without the user knowing.
This just means they can't easily collect evidence from criminals who are too dumb to set up their own encryption.

How do you parse that to read that they were selling data? It clearly says they are offering the tracking technology itself, not any data they collected.
If you do a little digging you can find the original research paper here: 
The reason they say that Coinbase offers its browser fingerprinting technology to other sites is because the Coinbase 'donate' button that sites can embed contains the tracking code:


It's a little disingenuous for the article to say it's "offered as a product" when really it's just "part of the service". As far as I know, Coinbase doesn't sell the fingerprint technology to anyone, it's only used to protect their own service. This Ars article about the same research from 2013 is a little more clear:

You do realize that the Bitcoin protocol wasn't invented through a democratic process, right? It was created by one guy who wrote a paper and some code and released it to the world.
There are some things that should never be subject to the horrors of majority rule, and the Bitcoin protocol is one of them. I'd much rather let the experts decide what to do. If they fuck it up, something else will come along.
Development priorities should be set by the people who develop the code, not random folks on forums who are more interested in increasing the USD/BTC exchange rate than making the code and protocol scalable.
