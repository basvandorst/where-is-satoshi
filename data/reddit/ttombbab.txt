I can do better than that,
You could use tags as internet theater tickets,
as internet free beer coupons,
a tag could pay bitcoin based on time like a paycheck.
you could program a rebate or a refund into a tag.
you could print them out or display them on a web page so people could donate to the picture on them or donate to individuals at an event.
You could use them as an internet vending machine.
You could use them for inventory,
you could use them for tracking expense accounts.
or you can just use the program as a wallet.

"So if someone offers you one of two bitcoin, you should choose the one that has never been attached to Silk Road or that has some dubious history. It could be that is eventually worth less. But in every other aspect, bitcoin is superior."
How exactly does one know whether a bitcoin is dubious?

Over time this would lead to negative returns and that would never be acceptable. Bitcoin will always be dependant on other currencies.

The tokens are programmed to give you your cut of the interest. If the loan goes into default the token knows that.

It needs an empty sub directory to make an initial panel but the empty directory can be deleted later.

Short answer yes. You could do it now with some program on your computer just monitoring an account.

I did it just for fun but it is also useful.
