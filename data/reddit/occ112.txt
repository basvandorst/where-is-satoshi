Some guy was willing to buy on a forum. He had good rep and I was a new user. I went first and he never paid.

You mean send all my BTC from my bitcoin-qt to blockchain?
@_date: 2013-08-01 14:20:59
I once lost 4 BTC to a scammer. I felt so fucking stupid.
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:20:34
I just posted a programming service!
Hopefully I'll get customers!
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:40:31
wtf? that's like $5000
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:53:59
That's basically what I need to figure out.
@_date: 2013-03-06 04:49:05
So if I took my wallet.dat and put it on another computer then I'd have my coins show up there?
What if I wanted to send coins on a library computer through the web like paypal?
@_date: 2013-07-07 08:19:25
haha it's gonna go down again.
@_date: 2013-03-06 01:12:06
Thank you so much (:

How would I transfer the money from my client to the account the bot made for me without paying the fee?
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:27:34
I transferred the money from my reddit account to my computer's bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:51:52
Is there way for me to access my coins from blockchain and the client at the same time?
@_date: 2013-04-01 03:59:26
Now you ca withdraw it to your personal wallet.

Great news!
I has around 5 coins back in the day but I just deleted everything on my old computer in 2011. Now I regret doing that!
@_date: 2013-06-14 00:59:02
They changed the board? I saw it a few weeks ago, it said "memorydealers.com - we also accept bitcoins"
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:43:46
Usually happens, you've just gotta wait.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:38:47
Where exactly can I find wallet.dat?
I tried looking for it and had no success.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:12:27
For the past 3 weeks the price dropped on wed, thurs or Friday and skyrocket on Mondays. Lets see what happens

If he gave the Moneypak code then you are 100% safe.

How would I go about getting all my coins into blockchain.info?
By they way do you think it's a good idea to move by coins from qt to blockchain?
I don't wanna deal with downloading the blocks every time I open qt.
@_date: 2013-03-28 06:59:14
I think that clarified everything. 
Thanks (:

What's the idea behind the 1 million cap?
I don't get it.
@_date: 2013-03-05 23:13:15
I set up my bitcoin client for the first time and was fascinated by the idea. So, I came on to see what it's like and boom I see a giveaway for donations!!
I donated ASAP and got bitcoins. Looks like it was my lucky day.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:30:03
Same here
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:59:33
I'll buy $350 worth
@_date: 2013-06-19 01:38:20
I like this idea but is there a possibility of my coins being lost forever if I put 0 as fee?
@_date: 2013-03-19 07:30:44
I almost sold by coins the other day. 
Thank god I didn't :D
@_date: 2013-03-28 03:52:12
I too was scammed :(
