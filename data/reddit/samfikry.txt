By the way, your husband left all the necessary information to retrieve the funds.
You just needed tutorials how to do it.
So sorry for your unexpected loss

I'm so sorry for your loss, and thank you for sharing this with us for us to learn.
2 big lessons here,
1st and most important for life :  simply don't blame yourself on things you can't control like future. Take decisions on the criteria of present and learn from your mistakes.   Life is much more important than money and consumables, if bitcoin becomes more important, then you know you need to rectify things.
2nd for finance: it seems that HODL is the golden rule for crypto that has less regret. 
Thank you again
