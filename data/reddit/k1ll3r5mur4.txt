Fuck the downvoters. I use them all of the time. They're fast and reliable.

I think that they solely take BTC. I want them to get more people interested in what they do so that they can increase their volume and gift card carrying capacity.

Keep telling yourself that your attitude is appreciated. Fucker.

I love that the best comebacks that you can muster stem from the basest of middle school taunts. And it's all the better that all of your bullshit arguments are 100% unsubstantiated. You run around screaming scammer and calling people little kids, when in reality it is people like you that make crypto unappealing.

That's just like, your opinion man. She has been denied any means to do anything with herself because of her parents negligence. It is not her fault, and she deserves all of the help that anyone can give her. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:10:29
Whatever. Look at the facts, not her poor choice of wording that set you off for some reason. Her entire existence is landlocked to what her parents decide to do next. Put yourself in her shoes, zero prospects to do anything, go anywhere, be anyone, other than what she is now. She has no future. For her 'functioning member' means to go out and live her fucking life the way she wants. Which might I remind you, she has no means to do so.
