For more profit. You gotta spend money to make money. Human greed. Not saying this to belittle him or anything, I and 99% others are same way

I made the wallets on a live linux USB with my computer disconnected from the internet so the creation was secure, but I store the private keys on a hard drive and and usb as well as on paper. The hardrive is occasionally plugged into my computer when I transfer large files.

I used bitaddress by downloading the html and then using it on a live boot from usb to create a paper wallet and have since sent a few coins to it. Is this safe?
@_date: 2016-08-27 21:34:23
Ok I see the stupidity of that but since the keys are encrypted I thought I was ok. Im gonna redo them tho
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:39:37
Lol, no.

1% a day is nothing thats like 1 dollar on a 100 dollar loan. Go back to your hole you filthy hobbit
EDIT: haha I was trolling guys chill out
@_date: 2016-08-14 19:46:12
I don't have the HTML anymore. What I did was download the whole bitaddress .zip that's the link at the bottom of the website, then extract it and put the html onto a freshly made live Linux USB.
I then booted my computer from the live USB (internet unplugged, no wifi). I loaded the HTML in the firefox browser on the linux and created a couple of paper wallets. Saved the addresses and private keys on paper and also encrypted it with BIP.
Then turned off computer and unplugged usb. I then plugged USB in when I booted windows (before plugging internet back in) and formatted the USB.

No one gives a fuck what iphone you have.
@_date: 2016-08-28 15:14:47
Yep you are right, I've already made new wallets this time the keys are completely offline.

Ok, I have 400 bucks. Can you elaborate pls?

How do you know what the aliens want?
@_date: 2016-01-06 17:18:05
Uh huh.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:27:10
Could you elaborate on what you mean by "most exchanges will not like this"? What exactly will they not like. I have a $3000 monthly buy limit on Circle which I do not come close to hitting. 
EDIT: Also, how can I pay capital gains taxes because I buy the bitcoin and sell it immediately for a slightly higher "street price". I don't hold the coins.

I use Bitcoin Mixer. Their .onion URL can be found on Darknetmarkets.org under "All mixers". You can set the fee yourself from 0.5% up to like 3% I think as well as a 0-24 hour time delay. It's basically pay as much fee as you want with 0.5% the minimum.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:48:41
Yup, I always tumble the coins and include that fee in what I'm charging the buyer.
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:25:02
You're missing the point. Right now paying "extra" is a 10-15 cent fee.  A year from now, it could be 50 cents. Five years from now, $5. Something has to change

How can you delete your account? I want to delete both my Circle and Coinbase accounts.
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:03:10
Yup, start throwing out the -phobic and -ist words at any disagreement.

Or, we shoot past 1k all the way up to the ATH where we wick above it and then pull back to 1k, acting as support. 
Or, we shoot past 1k, shoot past the ATH, spend some time at a new ATH, and then pull back to the old ATH acting as support. Then, continue making new ATH after new ATH as we start to bubble.

Is this a parody of that Rothschilds quote?
