Please consider Pratham, an Indian NGO working on improving and tracking Indian primary education. India is the world's second largest country and its education system needs a ton of improvement. Better metrics and better methods are just the first step in this journey, but they are important steps. Millions of children's lives could be affected for the better by your contribution.

Hi Paul,
Sorry , but I'm unable to read your .pdfs correctly. Is anyone else experiencing this issue?
Could you have a .txt or .doc version?
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:58:19
Works. Thanks.

How is it better than vertcoin?

A payment method as a competitive advantage.. hmm.. weirder things have happened in the world.

Non-mining full nodes are not incentivized in the current bitcoin structure. No foul in explicitly mentioning that.

Good luck with your venture!

You're forgetting that there is 1 thing that is definitely more valuable than money, even constantly appreciating money - Life itself.
The group that solves aging will have the potential to be richer than anyone has ever imagined.

So, is this ATM going to emit bitbills, casascius coins or something like that?

I don't understand one thing about walls. Do the people who put up walls have to pony up some kind of collateral to do the same or can they just pull away anytime they see fit?

Check out freicoin. They have included a demurrage in the code itself. Pity the coin itself is 80% premined.

Oh, on how it goes, I may not be able to. The firm chose to go private recently and this usecase is not applicable here anymore. I was posting the idea for other firms as a potential way to send dividends to small shareholders everywhere.

Formalise the entire explicit and implicit liabilities of the government and give the present holders a clear government warrant, entitling the holder to a percentage of revenue. They can trade this asset if they want to.
 
Impose land taxes and electricity taxes. Sell or lease government land, if any. What the holders of the warrant get, they get. If the deal is done well, then a clear proportion of revenue will be considered fairer than default alternatives.

Chinese monetary policy is weird. First they ban more than a very small amount leaving the country individually. This is to keep the RMB up.
Then they go and buy tons of US treasury bonds that they get from their export surplus. This is to keep the RMB down.
Now they are fretting that the USA will do too much QE and reduce their value.
Make your mind up folks. If you had just let people take more money out naturally, you need not have stacked up all those treasuries.

An option for the dictator.
5.a. Start my own altcoin with a significant premine. Base it on a different algorithm than SHA256 to make sure that the bitcoin miners cannot 51% attack it. Have a very small percentage demurrage charge which goes to maintaining the network.
Have a physical distribution of the new coin done to the country's people in exchange for the old currency. Have a much smaller internet based coin faucet for the other countries. 
The fact that this new coin is acceptable for taxes in my country will provide it value and it will almost instantly become the  in cryptocurrencies, maybe even

MIRI’s mission is to ensure that the creation of smarter-than-human intelligence has a positive impact. They aim to make intelligent machines behave as we humans intend, even in the absence of immediate human supervision.
I am not affiliated with the institute, but am a supporter. 
The basic idea is that an intelligence explosion would follow when the first genuine artificial intelligence capable of reflecting on itself and improving itself is created. It could cross-check against its old code and make itself more intelligent, until it reaches its physical limits.
If you want to make an impact in the world by increasing the probability that when a genuine artificial intelligence does get created, it has a high probability of creating a future that is positive for current and future humans, please oblige by donating a little to this institute to help them in their research work.

When you do move to spending those bitcoins, please add [the sens research foundation](  in your list of charities to contribute to, if it already isn't there.
The sens foundation works on treatments to the various causes and ailments of aging. Space is huge and we will need to know how to stop and reverse aging, if we ever took to space in these bodies.
Since you mention freestates, I'm pretty certain that you already have the [charter cities]( and [seasteading]( initiatives in your radar. Good luck!

Thanks for the information!
EDIT :: I envisage that there will be an amount below which cheques are simply not worth it. Sending this money via bitcoin is in most cases, a no lose situation for the shareholder. It will require a corporate finance decision, I agree. As I said, I'm not aware  of all the possible laws that have to be understood for this. Just wanted to put the idea out there.

I wish them well in this initiative. I agree that a good webserver and an exchange will be a better idea than the mining machine. They can start using ripple to get everyone in the crypto habit.

Exasperation, I agree with the other commentors that your position is well argued and politely argued. So, kudos, you're ahead of the 99% of the net.
About the inflation/deflation cycles during the gold standard, the reason that would be given by someone trying to refute your point is
* The banks that issued notes over-issued and there were bank runs
* There were unexpected discoveries of monetary metals 
These acted as major factors in the inflation deflation cycles.
Both these factors are irrelevant to bitcoin. There is  no need to keep the majority of your holdings in banks. One might need only a small amount to conduct quick transactions. For most large transactions, the bitcoin network would be used. Also, it has a more predictable supply than any commodity will ever have. 
About the deflation, I'm not even sure what the world will look like if Bitcoin becomes a major currency. In a  Bitcoin dominated world, there is simply no need of buying any other asset for maintaining purchasing power. No need to hold land or equity or art. 
But I think long before that, there will be other things that will prevent this. Other countries adopting a blockchain based currency could be the most major negative factor for bitcoin in the future. The technology survives, but the present blockchain's value doesn't.

Bangalore, India.
The area isn't particularly disadvantaged. It is one of India's biggest cities. The issue was that the amount on my colleague's cheque was too small.

You could join up with the team that was going to run a bitcoin mine/exchange from the native american nations within the territory of the USA. They need the monetary support. You could use the tribe's legal backing.

Thanks for the information, but I was thinking of normal corporations, not just bitcoin firms.

Hal has specifically denied it saying that in his present condition, he would have nothing to lose admitting that he was SN. So, 99.99% probability, he is not SN.

Khan academy is in academics. Asking them to cover a commercial venture like bitcoin is a bit difficult. 
You may need to phrase your request about having a course in cryptocurrency. 
Topics to be covered
The Byzantine generals problem
Byzantine fault tolerance
Practical Byzantine fault tolerance
Proof of Work - previous usages
   Chaumian digital cash
   Hash cash
   Nick Szabo's Bit Gold , Wei Dai's B-Money
   Hal Finney's RPOW
Peer to Peer networks and their resilience
The creation of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto's solution to spreading the currency, incentivizing the early adopters
The concept of the blockchain
Possible Attacks
  51% attack
Other suggestions to maintaining a digital currency such as 
 Proof of Stake
 Proof of Burn
 TimeKoin - maintaining constant network uptime instead of fighting with CPU usage
Such a comprehensive request will get greater traction when you request Khan Academy to do the course. As an upside, if the course is ever created, a number of lifelong earners (like Bill Gates) will get visibility of this whole area and may bring in new insights and value to the community.
