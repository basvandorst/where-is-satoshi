Found out about bitcoin when I read an article about silkroad/Tor in 2011. Decided based on the drug market it was going to be huge.  bought 700 coins at $27 each, watched them crash to $2 each.  Felt stupid and forgot about it all.  
Then price started rising and use on darknet kept spreading. Bought a further 5000 coins at ~$5.70 each. 
When silkroad exploded I freaked out and moved some coins onto gox to try and hedge by swapping them for USD on the exchange.  All in all I lost about 1700 coins doing this.  
Over the next big runup I sold 2000 coins, pocketing $1.1 million USD. 
I still hold 2000 coins in offline storage. I lost ~50 odd coins on gox. 
Life is much the same. My GF was a bit weirded out when I told her I was a millionaire. She doesn't really like rich people but she says the money hasnt changed me.  I her some cool pressies (like a playstation and an ipad).  I still drive a $1200 car.  Its fine and I see no reason to upgrade it.  I havent really bought anything else for myself - I honestly don't need anything. We're planning some cool trips.  I invested $2k in one of my best friends' food hobby/business - hes useless at saving but great at what he does and actually from that $2k investment hes done really well (and my shareholding in the resulting business is probably worth a lot more). 
I still go to my day job because I like it and because i get bored as shit if I don't.  I have multiple plans for bitcoin and non-bitcoin related businesses but never really the time or motivation to pull them off.  And I constantly remind myself that I have this money because of luck more than anything, and if I am overconfident in my abilities I will probably lose it all. 
If my remaining bitcoins go to $10k each the only other thing I will do is buy houses for my 4-5 closest friends.  They are all struggling with inability to buy houses or difficulty keeping on top of mortgage payments. 
I have only told 2 close friends and my GF and family about the bitcoins. Most of my friends dont have any idea.

Thats rough! 
Stories like yours are excellent to keep people like me grounded, many thanks.
I haven't actually spent a cent of my bitcoin money, I just save a little bit less of my salary because I'm not worried about getting a house deposit together anymore.
