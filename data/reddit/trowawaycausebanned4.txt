I just realized that Buffet's ears look like they're drooping off of his face.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:35:35
Bitcoin still scares me because it keeps fucking me over and losing me money.
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:04:11
*Holds forever, hits zero.*
"I haven't lost anything!"
@_date: 2018-01-18 08:31:32
"Buy Bitconnect" Lmao
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:21:04
That analogy's just inaccurate because crows are one of the smartest birds. I just don't want to give them a bad rap.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:25:44
How can you afford so many coins? I hope they're safe
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:31:32
Gosh it's so true my mom's like his as well
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:18
I kinda understand the resentment now. I never really understood envy like that, until I've been trying to succeed as a trader lately. And for 2 reasons: 1. I'm too afraid to get in at this point. And 2, I just discovered my friend has has some bitcoin for a few months. So ya. I believe in the tech, but I also kinda hope it dips, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:58:38
That's not necessarily the point. Do some more research
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:13:29
Why do I still feel like it's not going anywhere?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:44:28
Welcome to @_date: 2017-12-23 08:10:02
Lol how fine
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:00:42
How come?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:49:07
I recognize your username
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:18:12
Pls explain
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:22:31
But by "afford", he probably meant, "being able to lose it without caring much."
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:35:54
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:49:34
If it was tether that brought it up, will it return to 20k fairly soon?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:51:19
Shoulda got a hard wallet
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:39:12
Huge as in, bigger than btc's gains?
What about iota? I like that coin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:58:49
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:08:37
What's a financial etf?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:13:05
Idk :(
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:58:51
Not bad
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:49:30
We learn from our mistakes. There's still a moon.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:43:09
What did you buy at?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:25
I was in at 10. Sold at 13 T.T
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:37:50
Oh... I thought it was an abbreviation.
$10 was late. I was in at 10c!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:46:08
Same, I knew about bitcoin back in the days but never bothered with it
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:54:32
I'd do it
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:01:39
It says, "Thank you, human."
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:56:35
But why?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:00:29
Just don't sell
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:23:41
Well, I don't know how mean they're being, but it seems like they're just having fun with you
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:46:42
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:50:48
weak hands
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:06:32
The good news is that they're getting smaller (We'll see about this one.) So do you think that it's about over (cause we've passed 30%) or is it still going?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:04:58
I can't tell if serious or joking.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:03:38
Jesus Christ. Imagine borrowing $900 from a bank, and then learning that that bank makes millions a year. And then going "Then why should I owe it money?"
It's a fucking business. You borrowed, you pay. If he wants forgiveness he should ask for it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:26:59
*Turns out it's his real key.*
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:07:22
So, is this their real faith over the technology? Or are they pumping for their bitcoins?
Hoping that a new piece of tech to make it useable is a bit far fetched. You shouldn't buy if it's not already useable...
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:01:24
So, was it easy to mine back then and did you keep them?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:12:52
U GON B CRYIN BOI
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:46
And now they have. Wow. Maybe one day doge coin will have value too. We can dream. :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:22:50
What is this 'holding' you speak of?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:43:41
That sounds good, which etf do you prefer?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:15:03
Can you store them all?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:48:27
That's it
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:29:43
Am I wrong for selling my (tanking) portfolio, to buy back once the drop has finished?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:46:57
We need DATES. Why is this always omitted?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:29:44
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:27:51
If it's a bubble going up, then it's a crash coming down...
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:45:03
Nice troll.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:37:50
Might as well have put that on options
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:29:06
Well, wait till next year...
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:26:39
No need to be serious
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:01:07
They're good. I've been using it for a few days now and it's been fine
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:24:07
Don't worry
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:12:38
Why do so many bcash shills frequent this sub reddit?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:47:31
Give them the coinbase app
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:46:04
"I only use Dogecoin"
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:52:18
What the Bitcoin are these Bitcoin? I Bitcoin into this Bitcoin for an itcoin and I Bitcoin a Bitcoin of Bitcoin people just Bitcoining each other off for being Bitcoin.
Isn't the whole fucking Bitcoin that (1) you want it to become Bitcoin and Bitcoined by everyone, and (2) Bitcoin, meaning that small amounts of bitcoin like this are still a good Bitcoin?
Makes no fucking Bitcoin how Bitcoin guys Bitcoin at Bitcoin, and it shows you have conflicting Bitcoins and ideals. If anything it's Bitcoin how Bitcoinly Bitcoined Bitcoin is since the only Bitcoin to talk about it will be Bitcoin "$Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin of BTC" since anything under 1 Bitcoin sounds Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:10:51
U r smart
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:09:43
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:54:18
I have 10 btc (bought at 19k). Fuck yea
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:11:42
Who didn't?
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:14:35
I know coinbase lists all the prices across different exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:40
10 is forward? Lol. That was the stretch goal for 2017 earlier in the year. Although, we might end on it...
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:34:06
Can you store any other currency on a ledger as well?
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:22:11
I've got about 10% of my net worth in. Is that too much? I still worry a lot. Due to voices in my head telling me it's gonna crash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:33:50
I feel you... I had at least a few thousand in profits, from 10k - 13k, and eth from 450-800... until the drop. I had no btc, but I kept panic buying and selling, and have lost at least a few thousand T.T Hoping to recoup on the bounce back up. Stressful.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:56:13
Shit, he should probably start on options. And give you the 1.5k left
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:29:35
Jesus, how much could you end up owing on a small forex trade? How do you get into forex?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:40:32
I know, but then I've probably lost it all and then some from bad trades and panic selling too. Learning my lesson, crypto trading is another game.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:03:47
Because I think that they're just joking
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:31:15
Let's be real, it'll be 100k
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:57:55
Are you boi or grill
I ned to know
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:19:25
Remindme! one year
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:27:35
Knew it
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:47:40
Lol. What are you trading? I've got a few calls on the sp500, BABA, some yolo shorts on COST (gonna see how that goes), and old calls on the tech sect. All of mine are to january or feb, I'm more of a swing trader. You a part of WSB?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:03:32
Yea that's the thing. It's only scary when you're losing money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:46:26
My dad- who had 90k worth of Apple shares in the 90s or something. It went up, it went down, and then he sold once it broke even. It makes me think every time if only he knew about hodling...
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:46:55
Making a formal request now
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:10:54
Here's the man who takes things too seriously and can't take an analogy
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:51:48
Wow. Hope so, I'd get so many bitcoins! But that doesn't seem reasonable. Honestly seems to be slowing already at 13k. I want it to hit at least 10k, then I might be able to get 2.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:49:07
It'd be funny if someone was like, "Yeah, I've got like 5."
But little did they know they just paid 20k for each, and have not made any money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:35:26
So it's fine?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:50
How will futures affect the price?
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:25:46
Oh, didn't think it was like that because most exchanges tend to have similar rates. Nevermind. Then I guess, which exchange that I can purchase btc with USD has the lowest price?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:55:07
20 btc was nothing in the good ol days.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:40:01
Saw it at 5k. Put it off, bought at 10. Sold at 13, and here we are, back in at 20. I'm in for the ride I guess.
I figure this: it's probably gonna crash. But when who knows. So I'd rather buy in now in case and doesn't. Wait and see and keep some cash ready. to buy for cheap in case it comes crumbling down.
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:50:46
Is it every 4 years, or every time a certain amount is produced?
@_date: 2017-01-17 06:07:26
Well, it's still used to buy illegal goods... How else would they do it?
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:19:28
Do people only want it because other people want it? Because the value is going up so they want to get in on it?
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:24:14
Wow, I hope. How much do you have invested?
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:36:03
Are there examples in history where the first, and largest for a while did not turn up on top?
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:38:21
How come?
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:57:19
Hmm, never heard of those
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:42:47
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:13:04
I'd take that
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:14:28
idk why it was bolded lol fixed
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:47:17
As opposed to which other currency?
@_date: 2017-01-05 03:04:40
If you believe it's going to skyrocket, why don't you invest more?
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:25:19
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:20:07
How much does it give these days?
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:21:08
But will somebody else only want it because they also think that it'll make them rich?
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:24:31
Does it have a face?
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:56:11
Which do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:49:30
Is there a competitor for the internet?
@_date: 2017-08-08 23:38:12
  for any period of time, longer the better
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:45:32
So bitcoin is the biggest, baddest, and will last the longest?
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:22:13
True. Blockbuster. But I feel as if all of those got shut down because a new technology appeared that they didn't adopt.
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:36:31
Cool. What about Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:36:08
What will happen when there are no more bitcoins to produce? Will the currency stabilize? Skyrocket?
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:38:43
I bought a week ago and it still hasn't gone through
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:12:30
Coinbase app
@_date: 2017-04-17 03:56:41
So how did that come to be? What happens when the government 'prints' more money. How does it end up in circulation? It's given? To itself?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:34:23
Funny, the people on subreddits that are the opposite, e.g.: many people have side effects of a drug, say that "The people with good results don't post anything. It's only everyone with bad results that complain here."
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:09:13
Don't spend it all so fast. That's probably the worst idea. What do you even need a house for at 22? And a 75g house at that? Re-invest it in things- there are so many more productive things that you can do with it. There will come a day where you need that money, and it being in a house will not be helpful.
@_date: 2017-07-01 08:17:57


This sentence... I hate it. Stop arguing semantics, you know what he means.
