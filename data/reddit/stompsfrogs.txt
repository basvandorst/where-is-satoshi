Or in Miami, "don't get high on your own supply."

It's over $100USD per BTC atm.

That's what I thought, so what is the fundamental value of a bitcoin right now? The supply is known so we should be able to figure out exactly how much speculation is screwing with the prices. Right?

I like this idea, all this OMG$120BTC talk has actually made me more hesitant about diving in. Can I bother anybody with dumb questions? I think I have a handle on the basic concepts although I tried to take an online course on cryptography awhile ago and failed it miserably... 
You see a lot of people saying lots of things, the more I read the more conflicting opinions I find. Like, there was a thread the other day that hit r/all that was full of people saying BTC was just like the US economy pre-1929, and lots of people saying 'nuh-uh it's not like that at all dumbass' but I couldn't find anyone explaining why not. 
I'd be willing to stick half of my (admittedly paltry) savings in BTC just to do my small part in helping to stabilize the currency if someone would be willing to explain it like I'm grandma. I think the idea is fantastic, I love hearing stories like how WordPress is able to give a voice to people who live in countries that PayPal decided weren't worth the trouble of doing business with and that sort of thing. But I don't want to throw money into a bubble, that would be hurting, not helping. The algorithm decides how many coins exist, it seems like there should be an 'expected' exchange rate that we could hold up against the actual going rate to tell whether or not speculation is inflating the holy hell out of the market.
tl;dr: I'm not interested in speculating, but I'm very interested in security and ease of use. Agree with OP, speculators are hurting BTC's rep.
