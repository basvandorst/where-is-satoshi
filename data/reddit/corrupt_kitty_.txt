Bitcoin as a currency is just one application, when the technology and applications improve so will price. Also, the price is healthy right now. Everything is fine, be patient.

The tx fees for Bitcoin spiked at 2pm today, anyone have any information on this? Was paying 1 sat/b yesterday and now it's 44 sat/b.

Not your keys, not your Bitcoin. Sorry brother.

Line charts? Come on man, turn on those candle sticks.

Nah just a smudge. Lol

It went ok until we went off the gold standard and started printing money when we wanted.

Use square cash app. You can buy more Bitcoin and send it to your wallet for free. For example a $100 bought on coinbase would give me 0.010421 BTC. On square $100 Bitcoin would be 0.010758. Current price is around $9181.

Already done!

It appears that sentiment is changing but I'm expecting price to tests the lows again.

Bitcoin will not fix the underlying issue of out of control governments nor could it support a global currency at this point in time. There would have to be some serious improvements for this to happen. Look what happened in the past few days. The mempool is getting filled fast and fees are really high even with 50% segwit.

Let's get this guy/girl banned asap!

Absolutely ridiculous... I hope I raise some awareness. People will fall for this unfortunately.

Lightning network is picking up speed ��

I am probably going to conduct this test with trusted wallets. I would not feel comfortable trying it with that link. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 00:17:56
You are correct, for some reason I didn't think it would work. But, I have tested this with a coinomi wallet and mycelium wallet and it worked!
@_date: 2019-01-12 22:25:23
I am only referring to Bitcoin so it sounds like if I have a seed to a wallet I can restore it on any wallet. I should test this out! 
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:45:41
I may spend sometime making a list for the community for compatible wallets.

You will not get any connections while its synchronizing. Once it is done you will begin to get connections. If your not done synchronizing then your not green yet. Try the website again when it’s complete. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:02:23
Yes sir! We are green! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:52:17
I already have 1 up and running and plan on getting a second rig up shortly!

Everything you need to know is right there.  Use a computer with integrated graphics to save on power consumption. Or you can build a Raspberry Pi node ;)
