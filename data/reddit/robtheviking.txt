It's posts like these that make a circlejerk.

While I am not in agreement, I challenge your assumption that every person in existence today thrives on an absence of structure. Personally, I find that I fall into pretty awful routines without the order than work brings. I think that I would thrive with a (voluntary) military schedule. But I reserve that respect for the people that actually do that. And frankly, if you've never done it, your opinion is about as useless as a leech's opinion of life while on skin.

Hey thanks, John Titor.

TIL, the Internet is full of idiots.

Actually yes, the government doesn't really regulate usage of time...has it? 
@_date: 2013-12-31 21:41:48
agreed. 1.3k net upvotes where multiple posts on reddit kept repeating that you need physical access to the iphone to be rooted in this way. Also, the notion that immediately 'apple is corrupt' will pop the boners of any anti-apple bitcoiners. Apple is forced by law to comply with the NSA in general. So dumb.

I congratulate you on your ability to avoid gambling addiction. Would you like a medal? Perhaps a statue? Please explain to every addict what your secret is. Perhaps if they followed your lifestyle, they would be immune to its qualms.
