Not something this sub likes to hear but it's true. People who are just discovering bitcoin are much more likely to  "buy in"  if they can get a whole bitcoin at an affordable price.

I thought you'd like to know that the New York Times has quoted your comment!

So that the site's owner will make some money.

Look at the bright side, at least this is going to be a wake up call to those who kept demonstrating their economic ignorance in public time after time, blinded by their *virtual* profits.
That's what happens when people refuse to admit that 95% of traders see bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme. Hopefully now that people have understood the *immense* risk you take on yourself when you invest an significant amount of money in bitcoin, the price will go down to something that's closer to it's real value.

I meant if you have actually cashed out or is it on all "on paper".

Oh please... 
They had absolutely no risk whatsoever. So they spent a little bit of time to mess up with some new technology. They are geeks, that is what they do! I spend hours tinkering with stuff every week!
The ones taking risks are the ones who invest into bitcoin for the first time *right now*! And as long as the price of bitcoin keeps going up at the rate it is currently doing the risk is greater and greater.
99.99% of the people who are heavy into bitcoin at the moment are here because they see a huge profit potential for being early adopters.

Which is still easily traceable to the origin.
@_date: 2011-06-10 15:13:43
^^^^^^ 
That will be the downfall of bitcoin.

When hashing you are trying to find a hash that is below a certain target, when I mean showing how close you are to finding a block I mean giving some indication how close your hash came to that target. Obviously it has no effect on your likelihood to actually solve the block. 
It's just for entertainment purposes...

Even if this turns out false, as a outside viewer at what's happening in bitcoin this wouldn't really surprise me. I know some people are really invested financially and emotionally in bitcoin so it may be hard to swallow but you need to understand that 95% of the people who are involved with bitcoin are doing it because they see it as a potential get rich quick scheme for being an early adopter. That's not what is going to make bitcoin a success. This also makes it a magnet for scammers because people who believe in get rich quick schemes are usually very gullible. 
People get upset when bitcoin gets called a pyramid scheme but that's basically how it works right now and how it will continue to be as long as people see bitcoin as a investment an not an actual currency. The only ones getting rich here are the exchanges and the pools.

It's going to turn out like bit torrent. Does it have useful, legal uses? Of course. However you can't deny that the vast majority of traffic that flows through bit torrent is copyrighted material.

Are you using bitcoin as a currency? Lets say you are buying something and you are offered to pay either in bitcoins or dollars , will you use your bitcoins?

So are you going to drag the argument into the realm of philosophy and definitions or are you going to try and actually take a real world view and respond to my arguments?
@_date: 2011-06-03 23:16:07


Anyone who makes a serious investment in bitcoin at the moment is a fool.  The interesting thing will be to see how many people stick with it after it plunges. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 15:21:47
The biggest obstacle is that 95% of the people involved in it see it as a get rich quick scheme. Once that is over and we settle with the few bitcoin millionaires and the few who lost everything, it will be time to start using it as an actual currency.

I was actually referring to the fact that you think that Ron Paul has a good chance of becoming president.
@_date: 2011-08-04 18:58:44
Wasn't there a guy here on that put all his life savings into bitcoin? 
Also, this looks like a $10,000 put into marketing for this guy's company.
@_date: 2011-06-07 00:01:42


Actual cash or just potential?
@_date: 2011-05-12 14:41:41


You lost me right there...
@_date: 2011-06-04 22:17:54
Depends. If you are into it mainly because you think you might have a chance to make a lot of money of being an early adopter then that's not a good sign for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:44:22


Exactly. If he does turn out to be Satoshi that would be a big let down that it turned out to be such a prick of a person.
