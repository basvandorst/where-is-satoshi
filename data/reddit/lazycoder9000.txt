Coinbase never asked for my SSN.
Unlike Canada however, in the US  I needed to input my SSN to apply for a credit card. :(

Dude, they should totally ban cash! Those things don't even get recorded on a public ledger!

I'm willing to bet the OP, like a typical Windows user, consented to elevate the privilege of some pirated software or otherwise obscure freeware.
Further evidence that Windows allows the masses to stay dumb. Or did the masses give Microsoft no choice but to make Windows accommodate idiots...

Your typical Windows PC, in regard to the average usage of said systems, is **very** susceptible to security breach and info disclosure thanks to a complete lack of regard by users for separation of tasks, ie. Not logging into bank, payment processors or Bitcoin wallets on the same system you use for personal tasks and executing (and even handing off elevated [super-user] privilege to) 3rd-party software.
Same goes for Android "power users" who trust to install system software uploaded by random people on internet boards (cough- XDA- cough) and then install said system software to their phone to accommodate this untrusted code with all their highly personal information (including, to a far extent, authentication SMS/local tokens for 2-factor authentication to services like Coinbase, Google, etc)
A GNU/Linux live CD such as Fedora or Ubuntu would suffice for anyone who needs a sterile system to do important stuff in. The system boots right off of a disk... the media is read-only, so there's minimal possibility of malicious tampering (and if you need to worry about disk media tampering, you have a lot more to worry about already)

It prolly keeps a persistent session key (or cookie), the same way an Android system is able to sync with a Google account with auth occurring only once. Also, the same way you can quit your browser, come back, and get into your accounts.
Problem is that it's fucking blockchain.info we're talking about, not some email or YouTube account. For comparison, Google requires passphrase authentication again when doing critical tasks like Google Play purchases, changing merchant account settings, etc.

Word to the OP: Anti-virus software does not ensure security, it checks if software is bad based on a database of **known bad programs**.
Years ago when I was a noob I put together a Windows keylogger with C++ source code I grabbed online, and coupled it with a Tor client to send off the keylogs to a hidden service I was test-running. (this method is practically 100% anonymous, and would make it impossible to disclose the WAN IP/location of my server receiving the key logs). The logs were sent every 10 minutes.
I tested this badware in up-to-date Windows 7 virtual machines with various security software, Avast, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, and Comodo, and all AVs never set off an alarm for my keylogger (except for Comodo's Defense+, which alerted me to a program registering a keyboard hook, an alert that any normal user would ignore).
After the tests I checked my server. All the logs were there.
Now what if I decided to bundle this "spyware" with expensive software like Adobe Premiere and upload it to a torrent tracker? Hell, what if I target a Bitcoin forum? Sure, Bitcoin users are paranoid, and would easily dismiss my "GPU miner" as crapware, but I would've surely gotten a web-browsing passer-by to grab and install my "miner".
