One generally does not owe taxes until gains are realized (exceptions exist of course, the first that comes to mind is AMT liability for incentive stock options). That said "realizing gains" is different than it  being "in USD". Your gains are calculated based on whatever the fair market value is of anything you get in an exchange. If you traded the domain for a car valued at $50k, you would still be liable for taxes on $49,500 of capital gains.
It seems like it's not clear to the majority of US-based bitcoin holders that unless you're going to contort your life around bitcoin (e.g. leaving the country and disavowing citizenship), you incur capital gains liability every time you trade or spend appreciated bitcoins. Your choices then are to keep a record and pay your taxes, or to commit tax fraud.

If it were ruled a foreign currency, transactions involving less than $200 would be exempt (which would certainly simplify life for some people using bitcoin for day-to-day spending).
"Currency gains of $200 or less that arise from personal transactions (not for investment or business) are not taxable, but any personal currency losses are not deductible." (

Current best assessments have bitcoin not being a currency because it's not issued by a government. Instead it would be an asset, like gold. I've found this to be a good overview:

No, because the US government issues USD and collects taxes in USD - this is fundmental to what makes something a domestic currency. If you bought Euros and they went up in value and you sold, you would owe taxes if you're a US taxpayer (though there is a $200 exemption for foreign currencies, which bitcoin is not because it's not issued by a government).
