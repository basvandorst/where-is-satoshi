How long until wall street can buy in? Living in The Netherlands so I have no idea what time it is there and when they open.

I think it has to do with the fee that GDAX asks for transactions

Can we get a dumbest post of the day tag on this?

I think almost everyone who might just get $200.000 possibly stolen from them will have sleepless nights. If you have $1.000.000 in the bank and you invest $200.000 then you can still afford to lose it but it would suck major ass.

Where can I do this? I send BTC from the app on my phone (MyCelium) to a hard drive.

Thanks, so curious as to what is going to happen. Will probably be a shitshow haha

Who says he can't afford it?

Hey, the transaction still isn't confirmed and the MyCelium app gives me the error "unable to bluid transaction". Right now there still are 0 confirmations so I was wondering if you could give me an example of wallet software that does support replace by fee.
I also heard that you're able to cancel the transaction if it didn't have any confirmations. It there any truth to that or not?

What are the chances of it being dropped vs it never being dropped and me losing my money? I am going to hold anyways so time is not a problem for me
