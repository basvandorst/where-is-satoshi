Tks everyone I managed to do it via website what probably means that we have an issue with the app. I'm discarding coinbase anyway now for everything you shared with me to read

I'm using the mobile app. Maybe I should try the website. And yes, even if I try to transfer 1/10 of the value, it doesn't allow me.
Should I try reinstalling the app? I got all mybapps always up-to-date, best

Things are getting strange here...
Blockchain was my first mobile wallet 3 years ago. I still keep it though empty since i decide to use coinbase because it can keep btc and eth at the same time.
I just tried now to transfer my btc to blockchain, app-to-app. And it doesn't allow me. If I try to transfer the full amount, I get the message " you can only transfer 2.500.0000 btc". But I don't have that much, my amount is infinitely lower than that.
If I try to transfer 1/3 of it, I get the message "you don't have that much".
So, apparently, I'm stuck inside coinbase forever. 
It's like having bought weed, not receiving it and going to the police to claim it. But in this case there's nobody to help at all.
