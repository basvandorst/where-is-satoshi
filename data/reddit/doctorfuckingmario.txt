Yet they complain when we have adblock.

For now.

Yes, it does. I can't answer the "what is the point of having it remain in the blockchain", but it can't be deleted from the records ever.

Wayyy too long. My first confirmation took around 30 minutes, which is kinda abnormal because it used to take around 5-10 minutes. I've upped it up to .0003, hopefully that'll do something.

EDIT: You can buy a gyft card with bitcoin, apply it to your walmart card and it works!!! :))
@_date: 2015-12-14 04:43:44
Yeah, I hope the upped tax will help it a bit.

My first confirmation took hours, what is going on.
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:25:13
You got me. Tipped.

No more fucking target, thank god!

I pay .000124 for transaction fees, is that too little?
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:12:05
If you want it to take a long time or possibly not even confirm, yes, you can send it without a transaction fee.
I highly recommend you do though. It's not that expensive, the highest I pay for the transaction fees is .0006 BTC, which is the highest for bitcoin core and it's only 2 cents.

Don't use coinbase if you're underaged, use an offline wallet. Like bitcoin core, or something lighter than that.

I get amazon codes from places like swagbucks, and I just exchange'em here.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:37:13
That's great, thanks man.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:56:21
I know that, but who pays me? Coin base, or directly from the buyer?
@_date: 2015-09-14 11:11:25
If I can use rdp, then sure
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:30:21
Hit leap, basic stuff.
@_date: 2015-09-14 21:55:13
That's true. Anyone know any reliable ones?
@_date: 2016-07-17 22:43:06
Hey there.
The testimonials looked fake. It looked like the ones on those scam websites. And honestly, I don't mean to be rude, but the website design looks like the fake sites, doesn't seem professional if you know what I mean.
