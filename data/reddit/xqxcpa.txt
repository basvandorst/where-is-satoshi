It was so easy to avoid those regulations (use multiple email addresses) that the whole company and everyone involved should be equally guilty.

Putting my tax money towards public schools and healthcare isn't the type of "government power" that I'm scared of.

Public discussion and collaboration around the blockchain is one of the fundamental benefits of bitcoin.  To pretend like we don't have access to it would be silly.
Also, if we are amateur detectives, who are the professional detectives?  To date, I haven't seen a regulatory or law enforcement body even cite a tx on the blockchain in an investigation, not to mention try to follow the path of coins (with the exception of some very basic stuff in the Ulbricht indictment).
Would you rather the conversation take place on another forum that you don't frequent or do you not want bitcoin users to talk about it at all?

As to voter fraud, there are no more than a handful of cases nationwide.  You've cited an article that details a single of those cases and then says that it is one of the very few such cases.  The other article says it is theoretically possible that it has occured, but doesn't detail any evidence of actual cases.
[CBO report]( 2007 is a good neutral source on costs posed by immigrants.  It's not nearly what FAIR says it is.  And anyway, I am for regulation of the migration, which doesn't require construction of a wall and inflammatory, derogatory rhetoric.  The wall, demonization of migrants, and claims of migrant voter fraud, are all intended for the creation of a scapegoat population that justifies more police presence/authority and disenfranchisement. 
Better regulation of migration would be a good thing, but there simply isn't evidence to suggest that it is going to have a large impact on budgets, crime, or employment.   And it certainly isn't helpful to tell people that problems caused by globalization and increasing income inequality are actually being caused by immigrants.

So far he's devoted a lot of effort into making the claim for a much stronger DHS.  He's consistently put forward the rhetoric that I am in imminent danger from attack by immigrants and/or Islamists, and that federal enforcement agencies need more authority in order to adequately protect me.  To this end, he has made baseless claims about immigrants illegally voting, tried to convince voters that crime rates are much higher than they are, and created provisions for hiring 10,000 more federal DHS cops.  
The flow of migrants from the southern border may have a negative effect on wages for unskilled workers, but it isn't nearly the threat to public safety or social welfare resources that he is trying to convince me it is.  Building walls and deporting long-time residents won't raise employment outside of the government hires to do those things.  It will definitely increase government spending and won't save significant money from social welfare programs.  
@_date: 2017-02-24 00:52:52
Demonization of undocumented immigrants: Executive order calling for lists of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants to be published on a weekly list, fund and committee created for victims of undocumented immigrants, construction of a wall etc.  Clearly designed to promote the idea that I'm in danger from a group of people and I should be okay with more feds that are given more authority to keep me safe.  Very different then simply fixing border and asylum policies that allow most of those immigrants in.  He seems to be fixing some of those policies too, but it could have easily been done without also providing a basis for more feds with more authority and scapegoating a group that clearly isn't to blame for large scale economic issues.
Undocumented immigrants voting: It should be easy to point to if it is happening (as in the one documented case you mentioned), yet people can't identify more than 20 cases.  That video is cut short, Obama clearly says that citizens should vote in order to speak for friends and family that can't:    The reason this rhetoric is pushed is as an excuse to created more "voter controls" which are actually tools for invalidating legitimate votes.
As to more police = less crime, just look at 90's NYC, let's Giuliani south side Chicago, etc.  Maybe you're right, I dunno, but regardless it isn't the feds job.
States and localities deal with crime. If law enforcement needs to be improved, it should be done on that level.  Trump has been promoting unreasonable fears and arguing that we needs more fed cops with more authority.  I do not want to cede rights and privacy in favor of security.

You're showing that BTC to Au and BTC to USD are similar over time.  Since gold and USD are relatively stable compared to bitcoin, both of these graphs primarily reflect the changing value of bitcoin.  In other words, when the price or bitcoin rises by 300%, it does so relative to both gold and USD.  Graphing the exchange rate of bitcoin to any relatively stable asset or currency will produce a very similar result.

In the US you still owe taxes on the appreciation of the BTC even if you buy something with it directly and never change it to USD.  Exchanging it for anything is a taxable event - the amount of income/gains being determined by the difference between the USD equivalent value of whatever you used to purchase them and the USD equivalent value of whatever you exchange them for.  Probably not going to be noticed when you buy a computer, but definitely will be when you buy a house.

Wow, that's fascinating.  Where are you getting 30-90 days though?


The record date is November 6th. The quote above makes it sound like they need to sell them before then to pay the bills they incurred when figuring out how to distribute the BCH, which are ~88% of those 178k BCH.  If I'm reading it right, those bills we so high that there is only .09 BCH per BTC left for them to distribute to shareholders.  Is that right?
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:53:52
You have to add the amount they appreciated to your taxes, not their total value.  If you held them for over a year it is capital gains, if you traded them within the year then it is income.
If you do something like buy a house, then you would measure their appreciation by deriving there current value from the USD value of the house you bought.
What I don't know is if someone buys something valuable in another country, let's say a boat, does their home gov have any way of finding out that a person ever had those bitcoin to begin with?  I'm sure you would have to pay some sort of property tax to repatriate it, but would there be a way to enforce taxes on the income/capital gains?

No, it's like saying it will be built on top of tcp/ip.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:27:31
That's not relevant (unless there is asymmetrical access that results in more efficient tech in areas with cleaner energy production).  The decision to buy electricity for mining is based only on the cost of electricity and the return from mining.  People aren't going to stop buying electricity if they are making more money from it than they are paying for it.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:59:26
Number of tx per block alone doesn't play a role in the decision to mine.  The only thing that matters is the delta between return and cost of electricity.  Return is determined by value of the block reward and difficulty, and number of tx per block isn't likely a big factor in that.  If second layer tech sums lots of little tx (with little tx fees) into one big tx (with a big tx fee) then the total tx fee is still the same.  Scaling techs just make the cost of individual transactions smaller.  If the fee for any given block level tx isn't high enough, it's not worth including.  If the average fee per kb of txs isn't high enough to cover your electricity, then it isn't worth mining at all.
A hypothetical future where electricity costs are the same, bitcoin still uses proof of work, coin value is similar or lower, there are fewer tx per block and no block reward would be a bad situation.  Few people would make the decision to mine, difficulty would be low, and there would be a lot of unused hashing power that could be used for a 51% attack.  Mining is essential for securing transactions - if a group can amass more than half of the network hashing power then it is easy and profitable for them to attack.  We do not want the network hash rate to decrease.
Your other points are valid - bitcoin is more energy efficient than existing banking solutions, especially when you factor in everything that's used by nation states as the basis for their authority as central banks.  However:
1) Total energy consumption is unlikely to decrease as long as bitcoin still runs on proof of work.  And if coin value goes up and adoption increases, total energy consumption will increase.
2) A centralized alternative would theoretically be more efficient.  Existing banking is energy inefficient because of physical infrastructure.  A centralized and digital banking solution could theoretically be more efficient than bitcoin - if it didn't rely on violence (which is incredibly energy inefficient) as the basis for it's value like existing currencies indirectly do.
@_date: 2018-11-09 22:25:50
Fair enough.  Replace "coin value" with "block reward value."  I believe large scale adoption would increase coin value at a greater rate than decrease in reward amount.
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:28:37


No. Timing is how the changes in difficulty are determined (e.g. so that time between blocks averages 10 minutes), but the changes are a reflection of the total network hashing power.  As power increases, difficulty goes up so that the average amount of time to solution is still 10 mins. That difficulty is *the* security mechanism of the block chain.  If a single actor amasses more than 50% of the total network hashing power, then they can semi-reliably place their own blocks (reflecting unauthorized txs) on the chain.  The lower the difficulty is, the easier it is to perform that attack.
Bitcoin is currently vulnerable to a 51% attack in the sense that a chip manufacturer, a nation state, or a mining pool could theoretically amass enough hashing power to place their own blocks on the chain.  If total hashing power decreases, the feasibility, likelihood, and number of people capable of performing that attack increases rapidly.
@_date: 2018-11-09 20:07:35
However second layer techs end up functioning and however many block-level txs there are, the result needs to be the same: miners must be incentivized to add blocks and difficulty needs to continue increasing over time.  If that doesn't happen, the network won't function or will be vulnerable to 51% attacks.
@_date: 2018-11-09 17:22:59


That's not true.  Proof of work will be required for adding blocks even if there is no additional block reward on top of tx fees. A dramatic reduction in difficulty (which is synonymous with a decrease in power consumption), would be a crisis that would make the network susceptible to a 51% attack.
Mining power consumption is proportional to block reward x coin value.  A change in the number of transactions due to changes in usage, adoption, or second layer tech won't affect the total amount of energy consumption. However, if use increases but value stays the same, there will be a reduction in per tx energy consumption.
If coin value increases, then the only safe way to reduce total energy consumption is to move to proof of stake or another validation strategy.

Oh no!  Perfectly fine way to buy, but definitely not a safe way to store.  One of, if not the, primary features of bitcoin is that you don't need to trust anyone to store it for you. 
It's unfortunate that someone new to the space, and interested in using bitcoin, would be misled in that way.  I don't know this man and I don't really understand the comment system on his blog, but maybe someone who does could nicely inform him that he is misinformed?
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:26:59
I actually think they've hit upon something: the reason bitcoin doesn't inspire most people is that the idea of a digital token isn't that interesting and most of them don't understand what the blockchain is or how it makes bitcoin possible.  Of course, it is the blockchain that makes bitcoin innovative and brilliant, so maybe we should be starting there when explaining bitcoin and only once that is understood should we start talking about the merits of different tokens that can be stored on a blockchain. 
In other words, they are right.  Digital tokens aren't that interesting - the distributed ledger that they run on is what is brilliant.

In dealing online, yeah, you trust those with good reputations, but that is the same with any payment method.

Credit cards even require you to trust that you will be charged only once and that no one will steal your number and use it to go buy other things.  Bitcoins, on the other hand, eliminate the need for trust in banks and governments to maintain the value of currency along with the need to trust merchants to keep your identity information safe.

All those things you mentioned are true - governments used to endorse gold as a currency and still do stockpile gold today, but why does that give it value? Does the idea that a formal organization such as a government likes gold make it more legitimate than a certain open-source cryptographic protocol that regular people all over the world organically began to use? 
You are right - I have no guarantee that people will find Bitcoins to be valuable forever, but it seems to be a much more sound system than any other so it is a bet that I'm willing to take. Why does that idea offend you?  Why do you feel the need to insist that people who adopt it will lose "money"? And why do you think people will continue to find gold valuable - just because of inertia? 
Can't you see the utility of a scarce resource that can be effortlessly transferred between individuals without any hierarchical organizations necessary at any step?

Jesus Christ - there is no evidence to suggest that bitfloor selectively honored transactions. Just because one guy probably put the wrong account number down when making a deposit and screamed about it in multiple reddit posts before deleting his account doesn't mean that people should have predicted that Chase or whoever would shut down Bitfloor's account in the coming days. I'm not a fan of Bitfloor's customer service either, but there was absolutely no indication to users that their bank account would be shut down. Trying to claim that the linked post is evidence to the contrary or that bitfloor users were "careless" is asinine.

Also, my "separate thought" doesn't apply to those markets because the commodities being exchanged don't have a transfer protocol built into them.

I am aware that the previous iteration of Bitfloor had its primary wallet stolen, but pretty much ever exchange has been hacked in some way or another.  I only keep USD that I am planning to buy with in that account, and as soon as I buy any BTC I transfer it to my own wallet.  As a FinCen registered MSB, Bitfloor is legally obligated to return my funds.  How would any available information that I am not aware of suggest that I will not get my USD back, or that I was unwise to have had it on their site?

Yeah, I'm aware of how trading on big exchanges works.  Those markets don't look like this one for a number of reasons, most importantly because on exchanges like the NASDAQ, "market orders" don't get executed at a 50% price disparity over an hour from when they were placed.  I mean, I'm sure it has happened before and I'm sure there are plenty of cheap/shitty brokerage services that execute long after you place an order with them, but that is different.

No, he expects them to be valuable and to have x many BTC as savings.  If BTC are successful in doing what people want them to then there will be no need to "cash out" into fiat currency.

Stocks don't have transfer protocols built into them either.  You could hand actual certificates to someone, I suppose, but that isn't the same thing.

Jesus Christ, you just won't let it go.  I use plenty of exchanges, and can still buy and sell all I want.  I have a few hundred dollars tied up in an ACH transfer for the next three days and I'm out about 15 bucks on a transfer fee - really not a big deal.  Nobody was wrong to use Bitfloor and it is a shame that it is closing.  The only tragedy here is that I lost 8 minutes of my life trying to get that info through your thick skull.

I could be wrong, but I think getting set up at MtGox is only an ordeal if you want to fund your MtGox account directly from your bank account.  I'm pretty sure you can easily open a MtGox account and then fund it right away with Bitinstant at a maximum rate of $500 per day.

Isn't Coinlab just a new front-end for the MtGox order book and trading engine?

Relative to what?  Its buying power is still pegged to the dollar.  Sure, its higher than it was last week, but it probably lower than it will be next week.

Can I see a link to one of those threads?

Gold isn't used as a currency either, but it is still valuable.  Anything scarce can be valuable because people agree that it is valuable.  You are seeing it rapidly increase because people are learning about it suddenly.

They wouldn't be the general public anymore if they were following minute by minute updates - they would now be day traders.  And I would just be offering another day trading exchange service.

Okay, then what existing bitcoin related business is careless to use right now?  I regularly see posts complaining about Coinbase, MtGox, and CampBX - are the people that use those sites careless in light of those posts?
Please, use tell me which complaints "indicate" which site will go down next?

They are still really far from one mini rig, not to mention 100+

I am very aware of how an ACH transfer work.  It's been sent, it takes three days to clear.  Continue hoping that it doesn't if you would like, but that won't change the fact that it probably will.
I am very familiar with Bitfloor/LocalTill and their services.  I have "researched" them.  My research did not include interviewing about his customer support experience.
You are clearly not over that experience, or else you wouldn't be in a thread about Bitfloor insulting everyone who uses their service.
