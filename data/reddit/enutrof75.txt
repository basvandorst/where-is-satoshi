Nope. Still need to follow KYC there too. And you need to prove source of funds, otherwise you can't use it to buy or sell gold. If you don't believe me you should check out the community section for yourself:

I would consider a baller to be someone who has $250k+ of crypto. Assuming they bought between $250 and $500. Hardware wallet is fine for a baller with hidden wallet feature enabled (25th seed only exists in your head and never written down).
Not a baller? You can find a good second hand samsung phone these days for about $100 :)
@_date: 2018-09-03 11:58:12
If you are a:
* Noob - hardware wallet (or clean android phone if you're poor)
* 2+ experienced investor - electrum or hardware wallet (preferably both)
* Baller (2013 to 2015 investors) - electrum multi signsture wallet (2 of 3)
* BFX whale/Bankster/Winklevoss twins - glacier protocols (multi-sig, throwaway laptops, multiple juristictions, faraday cages, underground vaults etc). I'm talking about burning  thousands of dollars just to break the trail.

OP sounds smart enough to know the risk, so he's fine. Once he reaches "baller" level, he should seriously consider multi-signature to keep the thugs, gov and haters at bay.

I've seen this guy on the litecoin reddit defending bankers too. Your classic gov shill. If he's not a bot, I hope he's sneaking in a few btc buys when he clocks off work.

Then you might as well use a hardware wallet with hidden wallet feature. You get all the features of a paper wallet (seed backup) with the additional feature of [plausible deniability]( This could be essential in a situation where you are under duress.

You're right...this could be an issue moving forward. So, the only options are now a) soft-fork with miner signalling (cross fingers, pray, and hope for best) or b) just give up (freeze enhancements with bug fixes only) and let other alts use the fancy features, like litecoin. Just my layman opinion.

Even if is gone, it's ok. Let it go. What you need to do now is step back, take a deep breath and think. Forget about bitcoin, money, your ex all the stuff for a minute. Find a place of solace. Best place to do this is in a place of nature, remote forest for example. Sit down alone and examine all the crap that you received and you been giving out. This is a two-way process. Don't rush, take your time. Call out to heavens, earth, nature, god whatever and ask for help. Do this sincerely with all your heart. Wait. For as long as it takes. The universe will give you a sign. Follow it and the rest will follow. Send me a private message if you feel like you can't take it anymore. I will try my best to help you.

Just man-up and change your bank. If that's too difficult for you, don't bother to cash in - wait for merchants to accept crypto and you're good to go. Rumour has it that amazon will start to accept crypto directly from spring 2018. Once they go all in, the rest will follow. Fuck the banks.

Nothing burger. To "spend" btc you have to join an exchange, submit your kyc, provide proof of income, register your real name, and link to your bank account. So this is the future of crypto, eh? Lol.

One word: keylogger. It sounds like your pc has been compromised. You are no longer the owner of your pc. Also, I bet you are using a windows os (win 10, right?).
Warning folks: DO NOT USE ANY WINDOWS PC FOR BITCOIN. PERIOD. USE A MAC OR LINUX.

As I already said above, windows cannot be trusted. Majority of keyloggers and malware is written for windows. Therefore ubuntu=no problem. Besides, linux's system of privillages are inherently superior to windows - everone has admin access even the users lol. And when you want uninstall something you can't, because you're not admin. What a joke.
If your really paranoid about keyloggers, use an open-source onscreen keyboard.

I know people turn up their nose at keeping some savings in fiat but in this situation you would have been better off if you did. I believe it should be an absolute requirement to have at least 3 months paycheck in cash for any potential emergency. Only after that can you start to think about investments. Yeah it sucks to have a significant sum 'dead' in fiat but should look at it like hedging or risk diversification.
@_date: 2018-07-05 09:02:18

Rumor is that wex is in "trouble" - hence investors are pulling out their wealth out of the exchange via btc.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:46:33
Simple answer: greed. It can drive the most ambitious of men totally insane. History is filled with the examples of tragedy falling upon those who were intoxicated by greed. All of these bad actors we have (roger, jihan et al.) have never known what it like to have tremendous power, wealth and control. And suddenly they have some: before you know it, they start to think they are the next rothschild, wharburg, morgan. Which drives them completely batshit insane. Their madness will lead to their downfall. Just you watch.

Interesting. Thanks for the info OP.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:45:55
The gamble is that you get both (btc legacy and sw2x) coins if you leave them on coinbase. And you will have the chance to sell either one sometime after the fork. However as of now nobody knows when that will be and how long you have to wait to withdraw. Not to mention the risk of leaving any coins on an exchange. Hence why its a gamble. Are you willing to try your luck? Then go right ahead.
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:11:10

If you are a noob I would highly recommend NOT doing anything. Remember: if you screw it up your transaction will be replayed and you WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. If you don't understand why then that's even more of a reason not to try. I think a lot of people buying BTC are going to be very disappointed when they won't be able to split the coin easily (no replay protection) and send them (where's the wallet?). Not forgetting that bitcoin gold turns out to be private key harvesting scam. Be careful.

@_date: 2017-10-07 22:31:54
As I gave said before, if you truly want to lock down your exchange account, do this: 
1) Create a 18+ random password (yes, it must be random with upper case, lower case, symbols and numbers). Use a password manager (backed up off your main device). 
2) Use 2FA such as google authenticator, yubikey or fido-certified usb key. Not optional, you must do it. Again backup the qr codes off your main device. 
3) Use a proper email account like mailfence or protonmail with 2FA enabled. Gmail, yahoo, hotmail and all the rest cannot be trusted. Period. Once again, use a 18+ random password. 
4) Do not use any windows-based os. I'm not kidding. 95% of all crypto thefts happen on windows 7, 8, and 10. Use linux instead.
Remember that the password to your password manager is the most important because its the master key that will open all the doors. I'd strongly recommend you use diceware words instead of the random number amd character combination. Why? Because 6 words are easier to remember and are more secure. Apparently dicewords have more entropy and you can add your own unknown 'salt' to it to make it almost uncrackable.
