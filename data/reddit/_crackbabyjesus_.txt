If you want to try out that theory by selling Bitcoin to law enforcement go right ahead.
All I'm saying is don't incriminate yourself by saying more than what needs to be said and know the law. If someone asks if you can sell them more than $3000/day, the answer is no. Don't state your reasons why. If they ask pointed questions, stop dealing with that person. Simple as that. Or register as a money services business and go through all the regulatory bullshit.

With the amount of time invested in this investigation, I seriously doubt the federal agent would have filed this complaint already if they didn't think they had a solid case. They would have kept the investigation going or moved on to something else.
If you kill someone it still comes down to intent and the circumstances of the case, it doesn't necessarily need to fall under manslaughter or murder, as it could be accidental, no fault of your own to avoid the death.

How would that be accomplished though? If you're trying to move cash into crypto, you either do it in person and get fucked like this guy, or someone needs to send it to you, and whatever receiving service you use, will fall under the money services business laws as cited in the case.

Entrapment is a lot harder defense than most people think. A valid entrapment defense has two related elements: 
(1) government inducement of the crime, and 
(2) the defendant's lack of predisposition to engage in the criminal conduct. 
The seller admitted to knowing the law, and all the undercover originally asked was what the seller's maximum amount was. The seller stated $2500/day max, but also stated how they could get around that if they wanted more, what the law is, and why they'd have to structure it that way.

Cryptocurrency is taxed as as an asset, but it's actually classified as virutal currency, [IRS Notice 2014-21](
"Virtual currency that has an equivalent value in real currency, or that acts as a substitute for real currency, is referred to as “convertible” virtual currency.  Bitcoin is one example of a convertible virtual currency. Bitcoin can be digitally traded between users and can be purchased for, or exchanged into, U.S. dollars, Euros, and other real or virtual currencies."
This IRS Notice references the [Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Guidance on the Application of FinCEN’s Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies (FIN-2013-G001, March 18, 2013).]( This goes into much further detail about the definition of virtual currency. 
Also it doesn't matter what I or you or anyone else calls bitcoin, it's how the law, or the written guidance on the law defines it.

Traffic law can be either civil or criminal, depending on the violation. Speeding or running a stop sign are civil, while DUI or hit and run would be criminal.

Nope, in most states it's an infraction that is a civil offense, which carries a civil penalty, not a misdemeanor or felony in the case of a criminal offense. You can't get a jury trial and don't have the right to be appointed an attorney (you can still hire an attorney on your own though).

Because the seller's intent was to circumvent the registering as a money services business and anti-money laundering laws, which the seller admitted was the reason for selling like this.

All the government has to do is see who's posting on localbitoins and go after the high dollar sellers, and this is just the beginning. Once the government has a couple cases that establishes precedent, they will most likely going after a lot more harder to hit targets. They currently appear to be picking off the easy targets who incriminate themselves by admitting they know what the law is, and that they're knowingly ignoring it.
I don't think this would fall under entrapment either because the agents didn't coerce the seller to initially post on localbitoins. Similar to a drug dealer on a street corner, if he offers to sell crack to an undercover cop, it wouldn't be entrapment. The cop would have to convince the person to commit the crime in the first place. If undercover was persuading random people on the street to acquire bitcoin and sell him $3000 worth, then that would be entrapment.

There's a huge difference between speeding, which is a moving violation under traffic law, and what this case deals with, which falls under criminal law. Intent is a huge part of criminal law, and can be the difference between manslaughter and murder.

If your intent is to circumvent the law, I don't think what you proposed would save you if a case was brought against you. A reasonable person would not play $3k for a pencil, or have a piece of paper, so I wouldn't believe a judge would rule in your favor if that's your argument. However, this is only my interpretation, and I'm most certainly not an expert in law, so maybe that's not correct.

If you're just selling a wallet instead of transferring, you'd still be subject to the registering as a money services business and the anti-money laundering laws.

If the seller's intent was to circumvent the law, which the seller in this admitted to, then he's in trouble. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:30:52
I'm not so sure of that. The agent purchased multiple times so they can know which wallet is sending them bitcoin. Also this doesn't get past the registering for as a money services business and anti-money laundering laws.

In this case the sell waited 15 minutes and called tried calling it a next day transaction.
