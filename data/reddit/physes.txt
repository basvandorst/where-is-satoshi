Not sure if this is a good move. Part of the purpose of decentralization is not only financial, but also legal and political. Europol is a territorial monopoly and is against the value of polycentrism. There are better models for fighting crime without having to rely on legacy institutions such as this:

Was going to include some major sex scenes but changed my mind ;) The market is all yours

Actually Electrum checked their logs on that day and said there was no one using it at that time, so technically they didn't. The theory is that the Hotel Wifi could have been hacked and a wrong version of Electrum was downloaded which confirmed the proof to Gavin at the time.
I just ignored that and went with them using OpenSSL. It's fiction. After all, implying Craig Wright had Dave Kleiman killed is also fictional. It's a story, not an article.

I'm moving on- if anything is wrong now it will just have to remain wrong :) Appreciate all the feedback from anyone.

Meant to say "sign". Edited. Don't kill me.

That is for the reader to interpret for themselves. Not sure how he is hinting that Gavin killed Kleiman though. The implication is that Satoshi was two collaborators, Wright and Kleiman (aka Romulus and Remus).

Don't troll. There is such a thing as artistic licence. And whether they used Electrum is an unproven claim, and if I remember the "community" are very skeptical of claims they can't prove on the blockchain. Many of you were making a song and dance about how Gavin's word couldn't be trusted at the time, and that they definitely didn't use Electrum. Give me a break.

Maybe he was lying to Gavin?

What verb would work to mean basically "mix with"? I don't want to use "sign" again.

Decryption is when you turn the hash into its original text. I don't think that would make sense here. Hashing is a correct term for you use the private key to produce a signature from a sensible piece of data.

That's the one.

Thesis of the story: Craig Wright and Dave Kleiman are Romulus and Remus.

Obvious to you, apparently not to others...
