Ohh yeah I mixed up, my bad sorry. I just used regular coinbase instead because they support debit card. My country charges me $70 fee for international SEPA transfers so it's actually even more expensive than the high fees on coinbase :/
Unless I buy more than like $10K worth of btc or something ofc
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:43:18
You have to be american, though
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:02:04
Yeah! Ogrr.com
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:08:22
Well yeah, I did mean bank, but every bank (that I know of) in my country charge insane amounts.
Never heard about that, that sounds awesome. I googled and it seems like it's an app, is it the same you are referring to? This would totally change everything for me and make it alot easier!
@_date: 2019-07-15 08:31:30
Well it doesn't work for me and I'm from Europe. They tell me I need a US driver's license
@_date: 2019-07-15 07:45:47
I hope it stays down until August, that's when I get paid lol
@_date: 2019-03-01 00:13:17
Did you see Electroneum there? 
@_date: 2019-03-15 23:15:02
$1K is quite a lot for some people
@_date: 2019-03-08 20:27:23
You keep 2 btc in a hot wallet? Damn
@_date: 2019-08-03 14:18:14
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:31:16
Since 2005 I believe
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:37:21
Ah yes, I wish I could buy a $6M bitcoin right now
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:09:59

What if you are the guy from the future who went back? The prediction hits and you dedicate some of your holdings and you succeed.. You go back in time to tell everyone and to stack up some more
@_date: 2019-06-02 08:51:37
Oh, I see. Thanks for the explanation, makes sense

@_date: 2019-06-25 13:56:26
God damn. Reminds me of when I made a thread on an obscure forum asking for ways to make money, and some guy told me to mine bitcoins. I just ignored it.. This was 2010, for gods sake. I wonder how rich that nerd is today

I read that some of it was used by the military, the rest of it "nobody knows", as far as I know.. It's weird how these things don't really come out, isn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:21:32
This guy bitcoins
@_date: 2019-06-04 17:14:08
Kraken started from a market forum just like mtgox. Pretty funny
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:22:27
A 30 year old, maybe. I don't think a lot of 18-25 year olds will be able to afford 7 btc tbh..
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:50:02
It is real. It's quite new in Europe, here in Norway we didn't get personal license plates until last year or something
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:23:39
Lol, sounds realistic
@_date: 2019-04-20 21:52:45
How do you fetch the keys from a pic like that? This is new to me
@_date: 2019-06-01 23:46:01
How would the fees be $15..? I'm assuming you're trying to say when btc rises significantly, the fees get higher? Well, you obviously spend less btc when the value is higher, so that makes zero sense
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:03:28
What are you impatient for? What's your goal? This is a long term investment. Think 5-10 years, not 2
@_date: 2019-04-30 22:23:11
Oh. I guess we're just late as fuk then lol
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:50:39
7 what lol
@_date: 2019-04-20 21:55:10
I hate myself for not using kraken
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:28:26
How many btc do u think I have to get to be able to get that lambo? 
@_date: 2019-01-20 13:06:39
I have used 1 pin for every numerical pin/password since I was 12. Stupid, yes. Now I tried 15 times and it still said incorrect pin. It has definitely been changed
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:44:12
Good stuff
@_date: 2019-01-14 14:09:32
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:06:04
This seems to be the most probable cause, I just find it very weird. I must have gotten amnesia or something
@_date: 2019-01-20 15:04:58
Yup, my funds are safe, I have now split it into a couple different wallets until I get a new hardware one
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:13:34
I see your point, but why would anybody use a crypto for ingame only, when it's better and easier to just use a virtual currency? Much less of a hassle both for devs and players
@_date: 2019-01-17 18:23:48
Why would he do that? 
@_date: 2019-01-27 22:36:09
Being rich enough to have time to do what you truly love and not having to do a shit job for the rest of your life *is* freedom

Bug? Are you new here..? 
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:33:10
Yeah, exactly. Well true, it would be cool if somebody implemented it. I would be sure to check it out! Good idea, let's see if it gets somewhere 
@_date: 2019-01-14 14:18:53
In a couple of years I believe having a whole btc will be quite extreme
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:39:18
There are many MMOs with a fully working economy, there is no need for another currency for those games. They have real world value and real world trading is a thing. Venezuelans make more money from goldfarming on RuneScape than they do with a regular job..
@_date: 2019-01-07 22:15:04
Yup, lol. Did you use MMOE? That site introduced me to btc via RS too, back in 2010. I could be a fukin millionaire from RS alone by now lol, if only I had kept my btc... Regrets
@_date: 2019-01-19 17:56:12
$200K within 2021. 1M+ the next 10 years

@_date: 2019-01-11 15:39:50
Almost 1000
@_date: 2019-01-13 22:22:59
Yeah, I think so
@_date: 2019-01-18 23:14:18
Idiot uncle lmao
@_date: 2019-01-23 12:11:23
Bitcoin will definitely grow 100x in our lifetime. Unless you're dead within the next 5 years

What vpn service? Interested in this
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:32:42
The last try I had to wait 700 seconds. It was weird though, it kept resetting the wait time before I even got to enter the pin a few times, felt like malware tbh

@_date: 2019-01-06 20:45:05
Ohhh lol my bad, thought he meant the spike
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:53:00
This is me now
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:56:57
Yeah you're right, sorry I came off as an ignorant idiot and a douche, my bad. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 23:38:56
Electric engines in cars were superior to combustion engines 100 years ago too tho. It was just a matter of time before the electric cars surpassed "regulars" again. So literally everybody saw that coming
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:29:46
Oops that was my btc, please give back

@_date: 2019-01-21 20:48:40

Well yeah, I know there are experts in finance. You do have lots of great points. I just think that most of the regular stock market TAs are useless for bitcoin. It's like bitcoin has a mind of its own and is not a stock or just an investment property. Anything can happen, and what most people say would be impossible for any asset, is really possible with btc, and it keeps proving it time and time again. There really is no telling what will happen.
But ofc, they do know a lot more than you and me, so I guess it's better than nothing
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:54:41
There are no "experts". When are people going to realize this?
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:52:22
Now most believe we will hit 100K in the next bubble yes. That's why we will probably hit closer to a mill pretty soon. That's what most people call you crazy for now
@_date: 2019-05-01 10:46:52
Thought this post was going to be about the rs market sites back in 2011 when I used btc to buy rsgp. This was a great post tho, btc will def become the blue phat
What crypto could be compared to the pink phat? IIRC the pink phat (originally purple) was the most expensive, but people duped it and thus it became the least expensive. Kinda like inflation
@_date: 2019-05-10 23:07:38
Been there myself.. For a couple years even, I couldn't spare a single dollar on anything else than necessities, nevermind bitcoin. Took me over a year of putting aside every penny I could to be able to afford my first tenth of a btc. It hurts but you will make it bro, I believe in you
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:36:20

I thought it said "buy chimps with crypto currency" at first glance
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:18:43
Total amount of money in circulation has nothing to do with the potential value of btc tho.. There really is no limit. That's like saying a painting can't be worth more than $100M because you only have $50M yourself
@_date: 2019-05-01 10:58:03
Where do I get this
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:17:57
Buy runescape gold for cc/paypal, then sell it again for btc
