Personally, I would go bankrupt off my fiat “debt” (fake $ printed out of thin air and loaned out with 900x the original minted amount and fake interest applied on the imaginary 900x) before I ever sell my crypto.

Whatever you want to call it, I would foreclose on my house and claim bankruptcy before selling any crypto.  They can’t take your crypto if you claim bankruptcy can they? ...yet

My point being if 1 person is willing to, so are others... this will only be reinforced as fiat collapses and masses move to crypto...

I’m a big believer in btc, as well as some others like iota and eth, even ltc and stellar and monero. But isn’t all crypto still speculative even bitcoin?  My personal speculation is that crypto is the future and btc will be the OG for some time, even if we consider btc “production ready” for the past 10 years, aren’t we still in an entirely speculative market?  It’s still so early in my opinion...

So you and I agree, it’s all pretty speculative.  I also think DAGs like IOTA will prove to solve some of the problems blockchain can’t.

I’m just asking, isn’t bitcoin speculative just like altcoins, (but less).
The entire point of bitcoin is much broader than scarcity.  Store of value is a quality sometimes correlated with scarcity, but other attributes are necessary like trust, fungibility, or in the case bitcoin decentralization, p2p, permission-less, borderless, immutable, etc.  these are all aspects that bitcoin improves upon the current fiat system and underpins the value of bitcoin.  But enemies at that, isn’t this entire experiment speculative?
The public ledger has pros and cons, but in the history of money, privacy has been intrinsic to most forms outside of the parties directly transacting.  The case for private decentralized ledgers is historically clear.  If there exists a market for bitcoin, there will always be a market for something like xmr.  Xmr also (as I understand it), doesn’t technically have a finite supply but for for all practical purposes it does.  
What’s more important is that individuals have free and transparent options for their money, rather than being subjected to only the use of their regions fiat currencies which are not transparent, decentralized or permission-less.
Eth has smart contracts which certainly offers more flexibility in use than bitcoin, and ltc is well a lighter bitcoin fork with greater supply.
Digital scarcity can still exist beyond bitcoin and other projects don’t defeat that purpose.  I’m just saying, even though I’m obviously a believer, aren’t we all still just speculating that there is an opportunity for world money to exist outside of fiat currencies?
