I see pre-crime as more of a though crime, or possibly planning to commit a crime but haven't done it. And that should not be illegal. So you are saying speeding at 110 in a 40 is a victimless crime that shouldn't be charged, even though he is risking the lives of others? That is totally obsurd

It's the dangers of it and the highly increase likelihood of getting in an accident. It is not a victimless crime because it is a threat to everyone around. Just as overly speeding is a crime

He said speeding is a victimless crime until there is a direct victim, so you are agreeing with him that if you are going 110 in a 40 that there is no crime being committed? I know that is exaggerated and hypothetical but there are instances where the lives of others are risked. When you are drunk (not just buzzed), you risk the lives of others by driving.   
And I was talking about thinking of robbing someone but not doing it, he committed attempted robbery, which is a crime, You are comparing apples to oranges here

How much would it cost for cheap specialized hardware? Lets say I had about 1k to spend, would I be able to buy hardware that would make me a profit in 2 months or less? And Also could I use my macbook pro if I dual booted and installed linux?
