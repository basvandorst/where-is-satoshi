I really admire this man, from the off. Even if I knew nothing about BTC, I can tell that he is a very approachable, agreeable sort of gentleman. All the very best to him.

Indeed it is, I'm glad that that message does come through. And thank you again for your kind comment.

Yes but since then a lot has changed, they're effectively laughing at us right now, as it's the BTC community that is struggling to find its feet again. (Which I believe we will.) 
But reading this then would have been encouraging, reading it now makes me cringe slightly.

Reading every page I can find and actively seeking out advice, sifting out the wheat from the chaff, trying to understand every peak &amp; trough and watching the biggest investment I have ever made get flushed down the toilet with every passing minute does though. Agreed?

in fact _jt have a doughnut on me. ;)

The best thing about putting a wad of hard earned cash into bitcoin is that you really do feel part of something. And when your community is hurting you're hurting, when you're celebrating, your community is celebrating. 
I hope we're all on the up before long. Hodl on in there.  
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:24:10
Why thank you. Be careful not to miss the actual point though. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:50:48
Hmmm - Being UK based I wasn't aware of that. This could play a major role in the out come.

I believe there is money on the side lines waiting to be pumped into BTC, investors have been waiting to see how low the price will go before they decide the time is right. I think we've bottomed out and that today could be the day for a rebound.  
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:01:43
Hell no. I'm not daft enough to listen to me. 😀
@_date: 2015-01-18 14:39:05
Not to worry though, I sold everything yesterday.. (you're welcome - enjoy your new riches). 
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:42:48
First it was $350, then $300, long term support @ $260 ("it couldn't possibly go lower than that!") at the time of writing it's at $230 and dropping. By the time you read this it'll probably be $210 or lower. 
I just bailed 36% down on the month. We can't all afford the ride. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:09:27
Thank you. :)

Quote from CoinDesk "It is very possible we have seen the bottom, however nothing in today's market is logical. Whatever your position, strap yourself in!"
@_date: 2015-01-30 16:40:25
I know that feeling - all too well.
@_date: 2016-01-16 12:45:41
Haha no, but I have locked everything down and removed my payment method from all exchanges. I'm strapping in.. Here we go again. Sigh. We need a quick recovery from this one because of the halving, which is an event I was looking forward to, now I'm dreading  it.
@_date: 2015-01-28 15:26:03
That's the gist of it. :) Very unlikely it'll stay the same. Up and we have a long awaited trend change. Down and it'll be a long feared crash. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:43:22
At what price is the correction? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:48:57
I did. Bought in at $379 and it's not been that low since, Admittedly it's only been 30min. But I like to think me buying that 0.5BTC has trigger the next big bullish trend. :D
@_date: 2016-01-17 12:17:57
$380 is fine with me too. If we've bottomed out already then things are looking fine. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 09:24:09
This is what is needed for blockchain tech, it will definately give it the leg up that is so sorely needed. BUT, will it make BTC obsolete? 
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:48:16
It baffles me that some people still struggle to add to a conversation without adding an insult to the end of their comment. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 14:11:49
Man, you went tip-viral. A coming of age story gets them every time. 
Now here's my tip, go watch a 1999 movie called Diamonds, with Kurt Douglas, you'll be bubbling into your popcorn all the way through and have a doughnut on me. BOOYA, BITCOIN BABY!!

I know of over a hundred porn sites that don't require any currency at all.

Your reasoning is pretty sound, up until the point where you start laying down insults in place of a just point of view. If you had come on and said something along the lines of 'it may seem unfair, but coin base IS a private Co. Etc etc..'  that would give me the opportunity to see things differently and perhaps reconsider my comment. But you didn't, you jumped straight to making judgements of my intellect, as possibly a child would do. Of course, I don't doubt that is exactly what you are. Perhaps when you grow up you will learn the values of fair exchange. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:54:35
WHAT THE FUCK!! Get out of coinbase straight away, Regulation will be the down fall of BTC. They have no right to even ask these question, let alone disrupt your service.
