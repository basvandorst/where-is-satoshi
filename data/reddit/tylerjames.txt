Who gives a fuck why you are here? Everyone is here for their own reasons. I am here because I find the technology interesting and I want to understand it and see if/how it progresses. If I makes some money along the way that would be great too. 
Don't pretend like membership in this sub means agreeing to be some kind of evangelical asshole.

Plus how could you survive without all the "here's a picture of a thing I bought with bitcoin" posts.

Maybe these people like Apple products and want to continue using them but just want them to change this one policy? 
Maybe a protest isn't the best way to get the message across but even if all these would-be protesters go and buy a Nexus 5 instead how is Apple supposed to know why that happened unless people kick up a fuss over it?

No kidding.  If you don't also complain and kick up a fuss how the fuck are they supposed to know why you are choosing a competitor's product over theirs? 
It's not like they see me buying an iPhone every morning and then I suddenly stop.  It's a purchase that's made once every couple years. Hard to send a message that way.

I'm not sure what's instant about the transactions. Takes a solid ten minutes to go through in my experience. I get that it's faster than wiring money overseas with Western Union but it's definitely not instant.

Wow and it has that stupid "Let the banks eat cake!" picture from the other day on it.

Thank you for taking this burden onto yourself.

And I was surprised to find so many economic experts on a World of Warcraft forum.  Look how smart and confident a person can sound by simply being a naysayer and advocating for the status quo.

Oh gods, if he asks if you're wearing a wire the price just went up

This one agrees.
