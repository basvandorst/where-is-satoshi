Dude what the actual fuck are you on about? Only on this subreddit would people argue that high fees are a good thing. 
I’m out and I’m taking my BTC to a quiet place where I can’t hear either you or those BCH morons chatting shit all day long. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:55:01
Don't be a dick! Why would you make the guy feel guilty for what he just did? For all you know it could have been a rescue
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:59:51
You still shouldn’t be using your phone at all

Dude, companies like bitpay don’t give a fuck about this “us vs them” mentality related to bitcoin and its forks etc. 
They’re just a company that want to make money and there’s no way they’ll shun lightning network if it looks like a good option just because there’s a flame war between supporters of bigger blocks and supporter of off-chain solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:12:58
Mate, there are shit loads of pet shops that sell rescue dogs! Don’t assume that they work the same way everywhere as they do in the US or wherever you live

Wait for gdax to work again! It’s literally your only option if you want to avoid fees moving stuff from Coinbase

The mental gymnastics people go to in order to justify their investing are amazing! I hold BTC but I’m under no illusions as to the fact that we’re facing a problem. People are paying high fees because they literally have no choice unless all they’re doing is hodling! 
I shed a tear every time I lose $10 in fees and I’m investing in other coins because I’m no longer convinced that BTC is the future of crypto. I hope I’m wrong because BTC is the largest portion of my holdings but I’m not holding my breath for the lightning network to solve these issues. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:15:13
Yeah I kinda agree with that tbh. As much as I’d love it to be the case, I’m not convinced it will take over as a currency either! I do enjoy using to buy things where I can though and, as a dev, block chain technology is just absolutely fascinating to me. This aside, it’s proven to be an incredibly good store of wealth! I only bought my first BTC at $1000 and I’m still making a ton of money. If it carries on like this (and I strongly believe it will) then it will make money for anyone who gets into it now as well! 
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:59:35
Any ideas how to sign up for the Beta program?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:53:13
Not sure why people are downvoting you! Denying that bitcoin has an issue with scaling isn’t helpful at all. 
We’re not gonna have a lightning network for at least a year and in the meantime fees are too high and transactions take too long (on average) to make small every day purchases.
I’m just as rooted in the success of bitcoin as the rest of the people on this sub but I think sometimes people here could do with a bit of perspective.

So I don’t know how much you know about how the block chain works, but essentially basically the only way bitcoin could ever be “hacked” is if a single entity owned more than 50% of the hashpower. 
It’s worth noting, however, there is no real incentive for someone to use 50% of the hashpower in this way because having that much hash power is earning you hundreds of millions of dollars a day. 
Even if you didn’t care about earning this money and decided to use the hashpower to mess with the blockchain then you’d realistically still only be able to affect the last block that was mined (so essentially only the transactions that happened in the last 10 minutes or so). 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:53:37
You’ll have to transfer back to an exchange, like Coinbase, and then sell but yeah any time you like! Just be prepared that transactions can take a little while with bitcoin at the moment so it’s more like “within a couple hours” than immediately 
Edit: just a word of advice - Never send all your money in one go to a new address. It’s almost certainly fine but you’d be wise to send $5-10 first to make sure it all works first
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:14:16
Yeah exactly! In the Trezor app there’s a “receive tab”. You copy the address there, go to Coinbase and hit the send tab. Paste the address in, set the amount and hit the send button. Easy as that really!
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:57:16
Funny how you’re being downvoted here! Those of us that care about bitcoin as tech and a future currency are far outweighed by those who are in it to make money. Not sure why anyone would think otherwise  
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:01:59
It has a chrome app and it helps you through the steps. They’re about to bring out a new Trezor in January though so I’d wait til then or get a Ledger Nano
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:27:11
Yeah exactly! You’ll still always have X amount of bitcoin and its dollar value will increase/decrease with the market. It’s just a safer place to keep them because exchanges have done dodgy things with people’s money in the past
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:04:23
Dude stop getting hung up on whether you can mine it! Yes of course you can afford mining equipment more if you have money, but were you expecting something for free? Mining is not the only way to obtain bitcoin! I buy bitcoin but I mine other, lesser known crypto currencies 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:07:32
Even $20 a month could earn you some decent money over time. You’re probably not going to become a millionaire that way but you could still help yourself with your first deposit on a house or something like that 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:06:49
Because they have a bit of a monopoly as it stands. A monopoly is arguably never good in anything.  Fortunately some new mining tech has recently come out and supposedly a bunch of farms are about to open in Nevada and other desert locations in the US (due to the consistent sunshine which will be used to power the farms via solar energy).
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:06:51
Don’t be a dick! Yeah he’s wrong about anonymity but he’s not wrong about anything else. Bitcoin is shit as an everyday currency for the time being! 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:21:28
No there's no limit but they only have value if people use them! Each currency has it's own limit (Bitcoin's is 21 million coins and we're currently on 18 million). Due to this limit, Bitcoin is inherently "deflationary" meaning that it should naturally continue to gain value over time!
