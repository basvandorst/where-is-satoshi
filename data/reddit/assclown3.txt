To be honest, pee wouldn't get me out of the pool. Someone needs to do this: (edit: possibly NSFW)

An inflationary currency by itself of course will not prevent concentration of wealth. There are many factors, such as tax policy and a massive global imbalance in labor supply and demand. But, all else equal, a deflationary currency should be much worse than an inflationary currency for preventing large concentrations of wealth.

How do you figure that? A wallet in cold storage will grow in value over time (assuming increasing adoption of bitcoin, which is necessary for bitcoin to have any real impact on this issue). A wad of cash under your mattress will shrink in value over time.
While the latter case might not be attractive as an individual, it is better for our society as a whole, because in the medium-long term, it forces people to invest their capital in the economy.
Picture this: per the title of the thread, 80% of bitcoin is held by 1% of bitcoin holders. Because bitcoin is deflationary, those 1% of bitcoin holders have no incentive to spend their coins. Suppose 25 years down the line, bitcoin has become the world currency. The price and value of goods and bitcoin itself has been balanced by the supply of bitcoins (20% of the total in existence) with the demand of the world economy.
Do you see the problem? At any given moment, one of the now very few people might decide they want to simply buy entire chunks of the whole world economy. After all, they have the money to do that **4 times over.** Say what you will about fiat currencies, but there is no one in existence that has nearly remotely enough private wealth to seriously impact the world economy. 
Inflationary currencies avoid this problem. I also think that this exact possibility will prevent the widespread adoption of bitcoin. It is impossible to avoid the possibility that at some point, a few of these extreme bitcoin wealth owners will decide to exercise their power, which will not diminish over time. That provides a strong incentive to avoid hanging any *real* economic hats on a bitcoin economy.
edit: I realize that new bitcoins are being mined currently, but the amount is certainly negligible considering the amount of expansion that would be required were bitcoin to become a non-negligible part of the economy.

I thought this post was remarkable considering the recent events:

There will **always** be people controlling you and your behavior through coercive force. We can see it happen virtually 100% of the time any kind of power vacuum develops anywhere on the planet. Power vacuums don't last for long.
I'd prefer that I have the opportunity to vote for the people that control me and my behavior.

Risked what exactly? A few extra bucks on their power bill?
This is the reason inflationary currencies aren't that bad. Stagnant pools of wealth **should** decrease in value over the long term. 
I think the fact that Bitcoin is deflationary will prevent widespread adoption.

Give them to me for safe keeping! I'll even pay you 5%/month interest.

When does the distribution phase end? And why should it end? 
You've identified exactly why currencies with a long term constant supply (such as the gold standard or bitcoin) are a bad idea. But somehow you come to the conclusion that only our 'generation' should get in on the distribution? 
Isn't this a huge "fuck you, got mine" to future generations?

This is a really popular myth here. If that were true, why was gold so volatile when it was the dominant currency? The late 1800s and early 1900s were not known for monetary stability.
