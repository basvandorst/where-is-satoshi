It's not out of nothing, it just appears that way due to hindsight-bias. There was a large risk that bitcoin never would have reached the point where it is today.
If you went to a roulette wheel at a casino, and you saw a man put his money on green and win 18 times his money back, would you declare that roulette wheels are bunk? Because the gambler suddenly has "money out of nothing"?
Investing in bitcoin has been mostly a gamble over the past few years. I'd say it's a gamble in the same way that investing in a stock is a gamble- you can research the company (in bitcoin's case- the technology and advantages), but ultimately you can't predict the future, so there's risk.

No, "accept" as in: you can trade your bitcoins for their goods or services.
While this is not quite as valuable to the bitcoin economy as a business that spends their bitcoins instead of converting them to USD, it is still valuable because it is one more place a person can spend bitcoins without having to convert them first. These types of places are important to the bitcoin economy because they make the lives of those that wish to have the majority of their personal finances within the bitcoin economy more convenient.
The more businesses that begin to accept bitcoin, even if they're just converting to USD immediately, the more reasonable it becomes for businesses to spend their bitcoins instead.

Won't that cost naturally go down as the block reward halves? When it halves, all of the sudden a lot of mining operations become infeasible, meaning the total hashrate will drop, but so will the electricity consumed by the network. Also, the more efficient hardware would remain online, while the less efficient would be decommissioned.

A bitcoin is an arbitrary number representing (currently) 1/12,600,000 of bitcoin's total "market cap". In order to make a fair comparison to gold, we would have to compare the price of a bitcoin to 1/12,600,000 of gold's total "market cap", not to a troy ounce or anything arbitrary like that.
There are 5.6 billion troy oz of gold, each of which is worth $1290, giving a market cap of ~$7.224 trillion. 7.224 trillion / 12,600,000 gives a share (equivalent to 1 BTC vs. total BTC) of $573,333.
Given the above, I would argue that gold is "above $25,000".

RE: low-risk assets. Fine, don't invest in CDs, invest in the S&amp;P500... you'll probably do well enough. It doesn't matter- that wasn't the point of my argument.

Depending on how many of these asicminer has sold, they may even represent a significant portion of the current hashrate (for certain definitions of "significant").

There's at least one out there right now. I don't have the time right now, but if I remember tomorrow I'll look it up for you. If you're eager, just ask  in IRC irc.freenode.net- they know a lot more than me.
Some pros of bitcoin are relevant to some portions of current commerce. Off the top of my head, it is particularly good for micro-transactions (reddit btc tipping bot) and illegal things (online gambling, drugs, whatever). It has, like you said, idealistic values to some.
When you say "Basically the same as any other bank", again, you're showing you really don't understand bitcoin. Banks are regulated, banks can be shut down, banks are more convenient for the average joe, banks charge fees, people run banks, there are so many ways bitcoin is different from a bank...

@_date: 2013-11-20 07:46:02
Bitcoins are issued in a feedback loop called mining. If you're a novice user getting into bitcoin, mining is pretty irrelevant. Basically, the more computing power dedicated to bitcoin mining, the more likely it is someone will mine a "block" (and be issued the "block reward" currently 25 bitcoins). More computing power -&gt; faster bitcoin issuance. However, this is balanced by an automatic readjustment every 2016 "blocks" that is based on how quickly the previous 2016 blocks were found. The faster they were found, the harder it becomes to mine a block, so that it will take on average two weeks to mine 2016 blocks. This helps keep bitcoin issuance at a steady rate. Also it's worth noting that every 4 years or so, the "block reward" is halved.
Anyways, If I'm not mistaken the average time to mine 2016 blocks is actually slightly less than 2 weeks because more computing power is always being added to the network. As a result, we may hit 21 million bitcoins before 2140... by a few years, maybe? The block reward will be very small at that point, we will hit 20 million long before 2140, the last million will take a long time to issue.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:42:29
I'd love to sell, so I can buy back in at a lower price and end up with 50% more bitcoins or whatever, but... the last time I tried that was earlier this year, when bitcoin jumped all the way to... $40 (it of course continued to $260, to only fall to $100). Yeah, that didn't work out so well for me.
I guess my point is, even if it seems like we're in a bubble now, it could still climb way higher and eventually settle above where we are now.
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:17:30
Is your argument that bitcoin is *currently* more like a commodity than a currency due to the state of the market, or that the fundamental attributes of bitcoin keep it from being a suitable currency? If it's the former, I don't have much an opinion on that, and I don't really see an issue with speculation on a new technology. If it's the latter, I'd have to strongly disagree...

Having policies controlled by a board appointed by a man appointed by an electoral college voted on by people seems quite a bit different from having policies controlled by the people
The real advantage of bitcoin's decentralization I've always thought, however, is that there is no single point of failure. The police can't storm some place and "shut bitcoin down". In practice, I don't think we'll see any "policy changes" to bitcoin, especially one as dramatic as the limit, for quite a while... the soonest would be raising the blocksize limit.

Visa charges merchants a fee, and they give you a cut of that fee (so you don't go to mastercard or whatever). In order to accommodate for this, merchants have to raise their prices (by more than the 1% you're getting, mind you).
Merchants can give a discount for using bitcoin because they don't have to put up with that crap (most don't right now, but I think a few do)
With bitcoin, I don't have to pay a transaction fee if I don't want to. I think you have this misconception because most transactions include a very small fee by default, but it's completely up to the user.
Your transactions are recorded by a central authority, and there are humans out there that can review your transactions.
What do you mean when you say "less anonymous"? I don't think you have a working understanding of bitcoin. Bitcoin transactions are as anonymous as you want them to be- and it's not difficult to make them so.

To be fair, it's not immediately obvious that bitcoins are divisible... I wish this idea was more elegantly expressed to newcomers. "mBTC" does it okay, I guess, but I think it creates too much confusion ("30 cents? I thought they cost $300!"). It's a shame none of the bitcoin intro videos cover this better. Even if they did, psychologically there's not much enticing about buying a fraction of a bitcoin... to a newcomer, I imagine it must feel small and worthless.
Given that bitcoin's utility is largely a function of its adoption, should we really be trying to "weed people out"? I think that the best thing for bitcoin's success would be to lower the barrier to entry as low as possible.

I don't know if anything's stopping them from doing that, but I will say that over the 5 separate occasions I've purchased bitcoins from coinbase, I've never had this high-risk issue, and in most (if not all) of those cases, btc rose in value by the time I received my coins.

I'm a pretty piss-poor economist, but here's my take:
Buying btc with fiat is good for bitcoin because it drives the price of bitcoin up, increasing the purchasing power of those who own bitcoins. Selling bitcoins for fiat is bad for bitcoin under the same reasoning.
Using btc to buy product from a merchant is good because it shows the merchant that there are those out there willing to buy with btc and that shows the merchant that it's worth their time to accept btc. We already know that btc is better for the merchant than credit cards, etc.  and we should support merchants accepting btc whenever we can, because the utility of bitcoin is directly tied to the variety of merchants accepting it. Eventually if enough merchants do accept bitcoin, then merchants wouldn't have to convert to fiat, they could start paying their expenses in btc...
I'm more confident in the second part than the first... if anybody has good reasoning for why buying bitcoin for fiat is necessarily good for bitcoin, I think it would be interesting to hear
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:17:15

I only have a rudimentary understanding of BIP0038 (and of javascript for that matter), but I think if someone was feeling particularly lucky they could go to bitaddress.org, hit the "Wallet Details" tab, and run the following javascript:
    var possiblechars = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z","A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","0"];
    for(;;) {
    var i = Math.floor(Math.random()*62);
    var j = Math.floor(Math.random()*62);
    var k = Math.floor(Math.random()*62);
    var passphrase = possiblechars[i] + possiblechars[j] + possiblechars[k];
    ninja.privateKey.BIP38EncryptedKeyToByteArrayAsync("6PfYU8C5sLGsjDNWsCHRYD6G5noFmc184Q4owtnfvXrUdpsfNkeTq2HDV8", passphrase, function (btcKeyOrError) {
				document.getElementById("busyblock").className = "";
				if (!btcKeyOrError.message) {
					alert(passphrase);
					ninja.wallets.detailwallet.populateKeyDetails(new Bitcoin.ECKey(btcKeyOrError));
				}
			});
    }
Which would guess random alphanumeric passwords and popup with the answer if it found the right one. My guess is that this would take weeks on average, and that's assuming OP restricted himself to alphanumeric characters.

You have to go to bitaddress.org because the code I wrote depends on some javascript at that page. I think you can paste it into Javascript Console, but like I said I don't really work with javascript, so... the way I did it was type "javascript: " into the URL bar (at bitaddress.org), then pasting the code into the url bar after the "javascript: " part. Like I said, I can't really recommend this, as it caused that chrome tab to eat up all my memory and crash within a few minutes.

Mega is an SI prefix representing one million. 1 megahash/second = 1 million hashes per second. In order to receive bitcoins through mining, your computer has to guess the solution to a puzzle. 1 hash represents one guess. The more people who mine bitcoins the harder it is for any one computer to guess the solution. There are literally so many people mining bitcoins right now that if you get into mining, the amount of bitcoins you will earn will be worth less than the amount of money it costs to run your computer.

This can be implemented with colored coins. A merchant would have to set their store up so that when they receive a payment, they send back a "colored coin" to the address that paid them. If the address that pays them has received their 10th colored coin, then the merchant refunds them the price of the sandwich.
There may be a more elegant way, but this is what came to mind first. Note that this scheme requires the purchases to use the same address to pay the merchant each time...

But it does have to actually fall at some point... my point here was, on this climb up, people keep saying "It will fall NOW!" and then it doesn't.

Now it has climbed some more... and people are saying "It will fall NOW!"... and it might, but I'm not convinced of the idea that it has to fall at *this* price point.

...yes? Bitcoin does that.
The only reason bitcoin wouldn't be a good store of value *currently* (as in- this doesn't apply to the future) is due to it's volatility. This is something I expect will die down when bitcoin passes it's infancy stage. It's not something that's inherent to bitcoin.
A few reasons (that ARE inherent to bitcoin) that make bitcoin a good store of value, are it's mathematically-guaranteed deflationary nature, the fact that with proper precautions it can be absurdly hard to steal/seize bitcoins, how easy it is to transport bitcoins...

Other people may wish to have a currency outside of the control of their government as well. Some people disagree with have the money they own devalued by their government's printing presses, for instance.
Bitcoin has a lot of unique features that make it convenient in certain situations. One example I mentioned above is ease of transfer/export/import. It's very easy to store. With the right precautions, it can be almost impossible to prove you own bitcoins, which is nice when you consider that [the U.S. has made it illegal to own gold in the past](
One example that has benefited me personally is the public nature of the blockchain. I sold stock in a company for bitcoins earlier this year. There was not a good mechanism for doing so, but because of the public nature of the blockchain, I was able to do so in a secure way. I emailed the owner of the company, and told him I would like my shares transferred to person B upon receipt of XX bitcoins at address YY. The owner could then easily verify the balance of address YY (simply go to blockchain.info and paste it in), to see that I'd been paid for my share, and thus go ahead and transfer the shares.
Ultimately it ended up being a bad deal on my part, but bitcoin proved to be a major convenience there.

No- the bitcoin mining market is saturated with people who wanted to get into mining without doing any research as to whether it would be profitable or not. Somewhat ironically I suppose, this has caused the mining difficulty to rise to the point where unless you get very lucky or somehow obtain new tier of equipment (14 nm ASICs I guess) before the rest of the world, then you'll probably never make enough to cover the original cost of the equipment.

My code relies on some javascript located at bitaddress.org, my guess from your error is that you're trying to run my code independent of the site.
Here's what I did specifically:
1. Copy my code
2. Go to bitaddress.org
3. Click the wallet details tab
4. In the URL bar, type "javascript: ", and after that...
5. Paste my code
6. (Hit enter)
While *technically* you could get lucky with my code, and the password would popup, *most likely* what would happen is javascript will hog your computer's memory until your chrome tab crashes. This has something to do with the way scrypt (which BIP0038, and also litecoin incidentally, use) or javascript work. Unfortunately I'm not terribly familiar with either javascript OR scrypt, so...
(to reiterate, the odds of you finding the password this way are terribly small, you'd have better luck with scratch-offs. still, I hope this helps)
EDIT: I'm rereading through the thread and it looks like all alphanumeric combinations have been tried already, in which case my code will yield no fruit for certain. Sorry!

If I "earn" my bitcoins into address A, and everybody knows that I've done so, and those bitcoins are sent to address B, everybody can see that and can deduce that I've sent money to B.
If I send from A to C (which is an address I've generated for myself, but people do not know that) and then send them from C to B, how do people know I've sent bitcoins to B? Of course, maybe they see it as a possibility, but isn't it also possible I was sending bitcoins to C in exchange for something, and that C is a third party sending bitcoins to B? Of course, this can be extended to many degrees automatically, so it seems even less likely that I'm the sender to B.
What about those services that essentially launder your bitcoins? You send them X bitcoins and an address that you own but isn't associated with you, and you receive X bitcoins from somebody else using the service... or something like that, I'm not aware of all the details. Aren't your bitcoins then disassociated with your identity?

If anybody is interested in the math behind baillou's 10-letter word with one misspelling scheme, here's what I came up with:
1. The number of possible misspellings for a n-letter word (that's misspelled on one and only one letter) is 25*n. Example: A 2-letter word with one misspelling has 50 combinations: 25 where the first letter is something wrong (1 of 25 other letters in the alphabet), and 25 where the second letter is one of the other 25 letters than it's supposed to be (naturally, the first character will be correct for these 25). Think it through and you'll see this extends to all n.
2. Therefore, under this scheme every 10 letter word has 250 ways to be misspelled.
3. I only did a quick search, but [this source]( suggests that a high guess for the number of 10 letter words is 70k, and a low guess would be 14k.
4. This gives a range of (250 * 14k) to (250 * 70k) possible permutations of baillou's brain wallet
5. That's 3,500,000 to 17,500,000 permutations
6. This is equivalent to 22 to 25 bits of entropy (that's pretty bad)

...like I said, it's in control of the users. Changing the limit is a fork away, if they ever were to decide it necessary.

How much would mastercoin clog the already rapidly-growing blockchain?
How would you respond to the argument that mastercoin is too centralized around the mastercoin foundation?

milli-bitcoin, 1/1000th of a bitcoin, per the metric system. Bitcoins are divisible (it wouldn't make much sense if they weren't- how would you buy a cup of coffee?)

in every way possible? I'm not sure what you're going for here. Central bank policies aren't controlled by a democratic majority of their customers.

I've been in bitcoin since late 2010, does that make my opinion better than yours?


It's a better store of value than gold, and it offers an unparalleled remittance mechanism... just to name 2 off the top of my head.


Why? People can't physically hold their bank account balance in their hands, but they value that pretty highly...
I've been hearing people like you say "btc is gonna crash, btc is gonna crash..." since we hit $250. Yes it will decline in value eventually, but unless you say when or at what value or how much it will fall by, it's a worthless statement to make.
