Bitcoin’s price will ‘skyrocket’ to $80000 – $100000 soon after the Lightning Network will be fully implemented. Unlike 2017 when Bitcoin went up by almost 1000% from July 14 to Dec 17, this time Nakamoto’s coin will arrive at its destination faster. Based on our research and inside information we estimate that the price will go up by 1000% over a period of only 7-10 days.
It’s exorbitantly important to already have Bitcoins in your wallet when this happens. Why? Bitcoin exchangers are widely known for doing shady business. Do your research, you’ll see that the truth is hard to hide.
It’s not that you won’t get your coins or your cash, but considering their stock solely depends on the customers’ buying and selling behavior, in some cases, they simply don’t have the stock to make the payments on time, either cash or crypto.
Hypothetically speaking, they have 700 BTC in stock, you want to buy 1000 BTC. They get the payment from you but they simply cannot honor your exchange because they don’t have the stock. So you’ll need to wait until other people will sell 300 BTC to them. Understandable, right? As long as you get your BTC, you can wait it out.
NO! The Devil is in the details. Here is what really happens, especially when crypto is booming. Here is what is going to happen when LN takes over and the Bitcoin price will ‘skyrocket’.. This is the dirty little secret all exchangers do:
They will delay all the BTC buying orders and make excuses like “We are sorry but due to an overload of customers the orders are delayed”. The only problem is that the exchange will take place at the delayed order date.
Let’s say you buy 1 BTC during the “Big Boom” at the exchange rate of $20000 = 1 BTC. 5 days later BTC is at $60000, but you receive the order confirmation from the Exchanger at the exchange rate of $60000 = 1 BTC, and instead of receiving 1 BTC you get only 0,33 BTC. Don’t fall a victim to that, have your Bitcoins bought before the “Big Boom”. It’s an easy 800% +. Read more onFAQ of: bitcoinvest.cc
