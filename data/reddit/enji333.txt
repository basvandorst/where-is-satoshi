merchant adoption is the reason the price dropped, it was a stupid idea imo, should have let the markets pull the price up a lot more before we got all commercial, if the prices went to say $10000 then the whole world would have jumped into bitcoin,

yehp, I even downloaded a wallet in 2010 after trawling the internet in some kind of insomniatic haze after stumbling upon bitcoin in a hidden dark corner of the internet, it's still on my old laptop, I just never bought any until this story came up.
really kicking myself!

should I be selling my BTC and buying Yuan? :P
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:34:44
true, it's totally based on the current market conditions though, and I have small overheads, and a huge profit margin due to bitcoin price rises, so I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of the profit margin to encourage both BTC usage and give my business a bit of an extra edge too,
with a current trend of appreciation of ~780% per annum
someone bought an item 2 weeks ago for $20AUD in bitcoin 0.0925BTC,
that's sitting in my wallet at $54 today
like I need the money, but not *that much* money

that's fair enough, I admit that it's more risky but personally I can justify it as if the price were to fall, I'm calculating my revenue by weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly averages,  and due to BTC trading the last month or so has created a huge huge buffer in my revenue for BTC sales as opposed to Fiat sales, ( that I'm sure all merchants have seen ) so even if the price drops this week, the earnings from last week more than counter that effect, and the fiat revenue would balance my losses also
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:02:41
its not fake, it's someone or some company with a shitload of money manipulating the market so they can keep buying in at a cheap price, (ie they're continously buyings then selling and causing a mini drop and buying a larger volume at the low)
otherwise if they baught $10000000 all at once they would be paying way way more for the last $ than they do for the first $
the steadyness is a good thing , it means they have big players buying in, you'll see the US exchange doing this behavior soon

the Chinese already have Billions of dollars worth of the Bitcoins, and they'll likely still be creeping up, cementing their takeover of America as the dominant world economy.
the Chinese have more people and so the distribution of the wealth will be far more reaching than having the US as the major stakeholder of Bitcoins ( ie 6 degrees of separation, )
Maybe the US will turn into a Russia style setup where there are a few Bitcoin trillionaires, but most have an even distribution. there's 61000 subscribers here out of ~22000000 uniques per month

btcjam loan to buy solar panels+miner/s, miner pays interest on loan + a small gain? time to do some seriously conservative number crunching
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:31:52


the price swings shouldn't matter if people actually use it in realtime, it billions of transactions happen every day.
the only problem I see is the transaction fee of 0.0001 BTC per thousand bytes, this **needs** to be made a percentage, not a flat fee. What happens if BTC reaches $1000000, we're going to be paying $100 transaction fees?!
I can see this as having a limiting effect on the maximum price of BTC,
around &lt;$10000, or a $1 fee

I don't know, I'm very very new to the day trading side of things, but know how to program, so this is really just to pounce on any opportunity to buy in at low prices, not for trading day to day, 
BUT I did base it off of the way [QT Bitcoin Trader]( works, ( it's open source ), though with the way QT checks there was too much lag for me so I made my own optimized little thingo. QT is pretty decent though suggest to DL and have a play around with it
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:22:52


yeah but that's all well and good, there are still a load of incompetants out there.
for example an IT department sends an email to the organisation saying the basic " never give out your password etc"
they always get a reply from at least a few with an email of their password
if you'd infect say 100 000 transactions  of 0.01BTC per day, and only 0.1% don't check , in a year you'd have made 36.5BTC ~$13000

should I be buying or selling right now? comments make confuse
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:58:23


fucking genius!
can't we just mark all the coins now with a massive amount of static?
actually I don't know the exact implementation of "marking the coins", but couldn't we have a safeguard built into the client, that senses any "marks" on the coins, and then adds a copy of each "marking" to all future coins
example: it senses someone has marked "good" onto a coin, so it begins adding "good" to all future coins that pass through ( ie all coins ),
then it senses "bad" and it adds "bad" to all coins
so the evil people come up with a codename they mark good coins as "sputnick", so the client marks all coins with "sputnick"

the problem is that trading bitcoin uses a higher price than that site, so it's no good to estimate how much I need to buy/sell, whereas if I go by mtgox prices then I know i'll be overcompensating for the price difference when I budget, which allows a bit of stress relief when the price goes down
this is because i have to buy all my initial BTC in AUD, with a shitty exchange rate, plus traders fees, plus time delay, all  when the price is rising
bitcoinaverage: $340US ($363.4AU), Mt.Gox $370US (395.5AU), 
buying from the local trader here is $383AU

it doesn't have to be like this, the Chinese market shows how they can be unemotional, when the US market wakes up the price becomes incredibly jumpy, but if we just calm down a bit

@_date: 2013-11-13 00:21:56
I dunno if i'm doing the right thing because I'm new to this, but I've added cash to a few different exchanges and have bots running that are set to buy when price hits $350, $300, $250, $200, $150, $100, just incase there's a sudden drop while i'm asleep.
I haven't bothered to make it sell anything because the last time I tried that the lag just made me lose money,
I've fingers crossed the the new iBit exchange has superior server capability so I can actually trade without so much lag ( [Australian internet is like 5Mbit/s]( )

no it's not a user fee, it's basically the "royalties split", 
I go use the ATM and pay a fee of 0.0001 BTC for the transaction to the manager of the ATM, say there's 10000 transactions so the total of all the fees is 1BTC , so basically as the manager of the ATM the manager gets 0.5BTC and Robocoin gets 0.5BTC
**this is a normal commercial deal**, it's really not that bad of a deal 
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:34:26
your first analysis looks correct to me and it would make 100% sence, that's how all atms and photocopiers and visa machines etc work, actually the robocoin fee structure is **better** than any normal ATM manufacturer.
you are leasing the machine and managing it, rococoin gets a royalty 50% (after you've recouped costs..ie pure profits) and you get 50%, so really it's a pretty good deal for just looking after a box that's sitting there

I think there will be one out of four scenarios
 either banks, massive funds and traders get tip and heavily invest in bitcoin, ( likely during a massive price drop suddenly )
the price is raised orders of magnitude higher than it is today
the banks and investors are already investing in bitcoin, but slowly to disguise and regulate the price so they can keep buying it while its cheap, then when they've reached their target they'll openly accept bitcoin and the price will skyrocket.
A major Government rules bitcoin illegal ( UK or US or CHina or Russia etc ) 
the price plummets and would likely stay low forever
