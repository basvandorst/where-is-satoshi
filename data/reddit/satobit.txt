The only real evidence is anecdotes from old timer traders and the leaked gox trade database, both of which could be entirely fake.
Whether they are fake/distortedor not  is not something anyone can claim (apart from karpeles maybe). It was more likely a group effort and a planned "pump".. Back then the btc-e trollbox was a lively place, check the archives.

It's because most wallets are global. Since in the UK we pay a premium to buy BTC because we have no  domestic banking wallets tend to use exchange rates based on USD/EUR not GBP.. So it looks like you have less but within the UK you have the right amount. Saying that,  7 quid difference is quite a lot.

Coin control on a major wallet such as bitcoin core, blockchain.info or electrum. You can select inputs, outputs and fees.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:38:46
Ledger wallet works well and satisfies your requirements.. But you need the ledger hardware. It will work standalone and also with electrum.

This is why in the UK our service only accepts cash payments for bitcoin.. There are various costs involved selling bitcoin in physical locations which soon mount up, card fees on top leaves the customers with poor exchange rates.  If a customer wamts to pay by cases they're besdt off doing it online.
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:06:20
No banking in the UK yet is why, not because the demand isn't there.
@_date: 2015-12-03 17:53:51
Because the address has little to do with it. Transactions are inputs and outputs the addresses involved are arbitrary.

Ubuntu is probably a good option - I believe bitcoin core is available in their package manager by default. If not you can download binaries from bitcoin.org
You'll need to open port 8333 on your router too.
Thatsd the basic, look for tutorials on Google for more info.

Surprised that a company as large as coinbase would take this risk. However, AFAIK no mining is done on coinbase nodes, so, moot. Political even.
That said, experimentation is important, so why not trial it. Even if the trial is public perception rather than technical..

You seem to have imported your cold key and then had the change from your 11btc tx sent back to the same address - which isn't a cold address anymore because you've used it online. As others have said, when importing from cold storage you should create a new cold storage address.
The 120btc tx happened a couple of days after your 11btc tx and the coins haven't moved since - but it does look like theft because the tx was split across multiple destinations. You either have a keyloggers, a remote desktop, no firewall or simply your email is insecure.

We run a service similar to a BTM. It will get new people into your shop - guaranteed. However, from what we have heard from our outlets is that generally they are looking for one thing only - bitcoin. Don't expect a surge in sales, but you can expect to have some interesting conversations with new customers.

Eagerly awaiting rootstock beta here. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 22:58:08
Except a lot of transactions involve more than one user. Often a dozen or two.
@_date: 2016-01-23 18:35:54
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:54:38
It's probably your CPU limiting the speed not the speed of the peers.
Also, 54gb for several years worth of transactions.. A huge number of transactions.. It is actually impressive - not "ridiculous".
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:43:58
I agree and disagree with you. From experience it is obvious that bitcoin core does not sync as fast as the available bandwidth. Part of that will be the connected peer speed but there are a lot of VPS/data centre nodes out there with huge bandwidth. Every block downloaded takes  to process depending on disk I/o, ram speed and CPU combined. To verify a couple of hundred thousand blocks is going to take a while on any machine. 
It's much better nowadays with headers first but those blocks still gotta be validated.
@_date: 2015-08-31 20:58:53
You should add us, perhaps as an ATM. Only in 2 locations at the moment but working on that.

You can't use bitcoin funds with the Neteller MasterCard, unfortunately.

Very good. A little dangerous autocompleting a bitcoin address, but nice nonetheless.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:23:25
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:25:42
I think the stopper for this is there is no way to sign a tx without the key(s). Else bitcoin would not be secure. I'm not a cryptography expert but I'm fairly certain its impossible to merge txs even with code changes.
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:56:12
Each block carries a reward of 25 bitcoin plus all fees paid for the transactions in the block.
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:14:21
And of course forward the port on your router too if your machine doesn't have its own public IP address.
Welcome to the network :)
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:21:32
Import the private key into a new wallet and then send the contents to a fresh address (or sweep if the wallet has the option).

Comments like this make all of us look like idiots and harms bitcoin's image. It does not make you "cool".
@_date: 2016-02-07 20:44:02
Nothing is sent to the recipient. You'll have to read up on it (e.g. bitcoin wiki).
Essentially your wallet signs and encodes the transaction and submits it to the bitcoin network, every node on the network will then receive that and validate it by looking at the blockchain history. If valid, its accepted and eventually mined into a block.
@_date: 2016-02-26 17:36:23
Ledger nano + OTG with mycelium is a good option
@_date: 2016-02-04 17:08:58
Depends on the country. In the UK businesses are supposed to report suspicious activity - there is an online system to report such things. Records should be kept for 3yrs but potentially more as there is no specific regulation for bitcoin in the UK yet.
@_date: 2016-02-18 16:50:01
@_date: 2016-02-05 20:27:32
I wouldn't worry, as other comments have explained. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:08:13
Most of the large balances are exchanges so actually many user's coin.
@_date: 2015-09-01 18:12:24
Good point. That's not right, thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2015-09-21 15:36:23
Email is not considered secure, mostly for this reason.
Sure, you can PGP encrypt - but very few even PGP sign emails nervermind encrypt.
It is well known that Gmail etc read your messages to power their advertising platform. They can do that because of the centralisation.
Edit: email is also not very comparable because running your own email server will likely give you spam filter issues.
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:37:20
Don't know to be honest, I assume you mean the one localbitcoins has for you IP. Not sure that entirely helps non-techie users though.
@_date: 2015-09-27 17:20:00
Generally you'd send the funds to the new walket rather than migrate the key.

Thanks for promoting science in the UK and for accepting bitcoin.
You should add a QR code to your page BTW, tap-scan-confirm rather than copy and paste etc.

We use satoBit.uk because it redirects to https - we'd rather send users to the https server automatically without disabling standard http :)
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:32:06
We're only small but I can confirm that it is not difficult to automatically adjust fees when there is a network backlog. After the first coinwallet stress test we implemented some code and all transactions during future tests went through as normal. Of course, it costs us money - can't expect users to cover the increased fee.
Bitfinex did not handle the previous tests well, but hopefully by now they've implemented some code.
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:55:54
Without going overboard with security advice in your situation you could set yourself up a "light wallet" such as Electrum. Rather than import your bitcoin address it might be wise to import it into a web wallet such as blockchain.info and then send the contents to a newly generated address in your new light wallet.
To export your key open the debug console from the menu and type 
    dumpprivkey 1youraddresshere
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:39:16
No you can't create a multisig vanity address. Well, maybe you could with some expert knowledge but it would be infinitely more difficult.
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:42:00
Wallets are generally separate to exchanges. You buy/sell on one and transact on the other.

@_date: 2015-11-25 16:17:28
Fair point but if the hacker had root access to take over port 80 to issue a cert then the cert is the last of your worries. You could also argue that humans can be socially engineered or phished etc whereas an automated system cannot.
Each have their pros and cons. Thanks for the viewpoint though, interesting.
@_date: 2015-11-24 17:35:25
Well yes, you can self-sign for free but the public wouldn't understand that.
LetsEncrypt verifies by hosting on your server during the reg process - I.e you replace your web server with theirs for 1 min. I don't see how that is less secure than basic email verification.
@_date: 2015-11-21 17:34:11
Heard about that, glad its now part of the code. Definitely a bonus to have some bitcoin nodes bridging tor with clearnet.
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:31:03

Monitor the mempool and/or the p2p communications. Probably quite trivial to edit the source to echo the new transactions as they come in.

Purse.io ?
@_date: 2015-10-10 18:50:18
Aah I see - that shows more than the two inputs shown in your address, another address in your wallet must have some spam coins - use coin control to select the inputs manually or work out which address has the small amount in and deduct that amount from your transaction value.
@_date: 2015-10-02 22:13:58

There can be no source for that comment unless a significant amount of users prove their holdings. If its from address data thgen those 1% would be including all of the exchanges as single users.

It's likely that investor pressure plays a part and if the team doesn't have the required bitcoin ideals then they will succumb to said pressure. But you can't blame the investors - they need a return.

At present you don't need any licence or rules to follow. Other than standard business practice like financial reporting, tax on profits and SAR. Basically just common sense at the moment, don't knowingly facilitate anything dodgy.
