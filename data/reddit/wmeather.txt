Not really. The price was much lower, as was the volume. $120k/month (.6% of 1 million bitcoins at $30) minus overhead is not enough to finance such a project.

Coding something similar from scratch would cost more, not less. Even assuming almost no overhead it would take the better part of a year or some venture capital to raise the money to even *begin* upgrading to a "industry standard engine" Doing so while dealing with scaling the existing engine? Better make that a year.
