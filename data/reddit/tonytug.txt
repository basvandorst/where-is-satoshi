I received my Shift card last week.  I'm disappointed that there's no bitcoin logo or any reference to bitcoin on the card.   My first purchase was for $2 swiped by a parking meter.

After about a year of talking up bitcoin to my friend, he finally said yes to bitcoin!   I set him up with the Snapcard terminal from  -They have a HUGE selection of succulents up there too.   Here's their site with location etc.

I've been using the  app' via Safari browser on my iPhone launched from a icon created by "Add to Home Screen" option.   I can launch, scan and send bitcoin in seconds.   I only carry around a small amount, so no tragedy if my iPhone dives into the toilet or I lose it.  Demo:

Love the video!  She sounds like Lady Penelope from Thunderbirds.  [Old (1965'ish) British TV show animated with models &amp; puppets]

..I walked in, looked at the menu and saw no "We Accept Bitcoin" or any obvious POS tablets for throwing up a QR code.     Next time I'm in Udon Thani I'll check it out some more.
