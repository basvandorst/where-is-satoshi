In theory you can route a transaction for anyone when the route from that user to you and then to the destination is cheaper than any other route from that user to the destination.
So if you want to route lots of transactions, the best strategy is probably to open channels with 2 large nodes (e.g. 2 exchanges). That way you have a short route to both of those large nodes, and you're likely to route payments that go between them.

What are you trying to achieve?
If you want to be sure that all of your transactions are actually on the real bitcoin chain as enforced by the consensus rules you're running, you just need to check that your node is happy that the transaction is confirmed.
It doesn't actually need to have your money, you can lookup a transaction like:
   `bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098 true`
and check the "confirmations" field.
But if you're running a node and *not* using it to check that you've actually received payments that you think you've received, then what purpose do you think the node is serving?
Because you can be sure that nobody *else* is going to be trusting your node to tell them the state of the ledger.
EDIT: I'm not saying you shouldn't run a Bitcoin node you're not using! You can do whatever you like, and it's fun, so you may as well do it if you're interested. Just don't have any delusions about "helping the network". A Bitcoin node's influence on consensus is about proportional to the value of the transactions that are verified using that node. If you're not using it to verify transactions, it has no influence at all.

You're thinking of plain payment channels.
2 parties open a payment channel when they expect to do lots of payments between one another.
Lightning Network is a network of channels between lots of parties that allows party A to route a payment to party B without having a channel open with party B directly.
That way you don't need to have to spend money to party B lots of times for it to be worth it, you just need to spend to *any* parties lots of times.
The business would only have a small number of payment channels open, and all payments would come in through those.

No, it's not. It's market manipulation if you deliberately release lies and then trade on those lies beforehand.
If you know some truths and trade on those truths before they become public, that's insider trading but not market manipulation. And that kind of insider trading has *literally* no victim. Let's walk through who the victims could be:
 - The guy on the other side of your trade: he was trading in that direction regardless of whether you came along, and because you were increasing pressure on the side opposite him, he got a *better* price than he would have done if you hadn't insider traded. He's benefitted. He's not a victim.
 - Other people trying to do trades on the same side as you: you're offering a better price than they are. That's life, they can't complain about that. They haven't benefitted, but they're hardly victims.
 - People who weren't trading at all: obviously not victims.

This is FUD. Payment Protocol reduces user errors and reduces possibilities for fraud.
The first half of what you've quoted is just ad hominem.
The second part (about trusting existing PKI) is partly true, but note that ~all Bitcoin payments that are going to web services are initiated over HTTPS anyway. If you don't trust HTTPS, you can't trust the Bitcoin address you are given in the web page any more than you can trust the Payment Protocol invoice you are given in your Bitcoin wallet.
And what about payment protocol do you think "increases risk of AML/KYC surveillance"? It's just a more secure way for your wallet to get the payment address and amount.
BitPay's policy of asking for an email address before giving you an invoice *might* increase risk of surveillance, but that's entirely on BitPay, nothing to do with Payment Protocol. And in theory there's nothing stopping you from setting up a throwaway email account for each transaction. And if you're paying someone who uses BitPay, the company you're paying probably knows your email address anyway.

The only way a decentralised news channel would be substantially different to reddit is that it wouldn't be possible for reddit the company, or subreddit moderators, to censor any content.
Unless you believe there's a significant amount of censorship going on (which I don't, although I am aware some people do), you can't expect to see improved news quality on a decentralised alternative.

I wrote this up in response to your link to  but by the time I came to post it you had deleted that comment. But I'm posting it in reply to your new comment anyway:


This is correct.


Also correct.
But imagine you're just running the node and not validating any payments with it (which it sounds like what you're doing atm). Then what does it mean for it to "ensure that all the rules are being followed"? Or "reject blocks and transactions"? It means nothing.
If some group wanted to change the consensus rules of Bitcoin, your node sitting there rejecting the new blocks would have no effect whatsoever because it wouldn't prevent any transactions from going through. If you're still using other people's nodes to validate transactions then you're still just relying on other people's nodes to enforce the rules, and those people can run whatever software they want.
The other points:






These also only apply if you're actually using your node to validate payments.


and 


are great reasons to run a node. I'd also perhaps chuck in "it's fun and you learn more about bitcoin" as a positive. But it does not help the network one iota unless you're actually using it.
EDIT: To be clear, when I say "validating payments", I mean you are checking that you have been paid by other people. Of course your node software runs it's validation routines on every bitcoin transaction it sees, but unless you actually care what the result of that validation is in some way, it doesn't do anything practical. You're essentially just feeding information into a black box that has no outputs. It can't affect the state of the world in any way, it does nothing.
EDIT2: I'm not saying don't run a full node! I'm saying *do* run a full node, *and use it*. Just running it does nothing, apart from the fun &amp; learning aspect.

More info on how this works at [
It sounds like it's closer to working than sidechains were when I last researched them. The previous best idea I heard was "federated peg" - where some federation of trusted parties control the keys for spending the sidechained coins. To deposit coins to the sidechain, you give them to the federation, and to withdraw from the sidechain, you ask the federation to give you your coins.
Drivechain's idea basically makes Bitcoin miners into the federation, and comes with some consensus rules on what is required in order for a withdrawal to happen: it can only happen a few times per year, and a super-majority of hashrate must agree.
Making the miners the "federation" means that any group of people who are in a position to cheat with sidechain funds are also in a position to do massive double spends or reorgs. That they don't do double spends or reorgs in practice implies that they also won't cheat with the sidechain funds.
EDIT: The downside here is that since there might be very poor liquidity between the sidechain and the mainchain, a non-unity exchange rate might arise. That's not that big a deal though, and the periodic transfers between mainchain and sidechain should counteract it quite a bit.

Atomic swaps allows you to quickly move coins in/out of the sidechain, but I don't think they will stop the exchange rate from diverging from 1.0.
In a cross-chain swap, no coins are created or destroyed on either chain, so the supply is not affected. All that happens is bitcoin moves from person A to person B, and sidecoin moves from person B to person A.

They've done nothing wrong. Don't panic. The coins are still yours. Just send an arbitrarily-small payment to any one of the 20 addresses within the gap limit, and your number-21 address will now fall within the gap limit and will be picked up by their wallet.
EDIT: Ah, the funds have disappeared from the address now. I can't explain that. Maybe you did get your coins back and are just slandering blockchain.com, or maybe blockchain.com automatically sweep any money that they control that does not appear in any user's wallet?

I just downloaded the page with curl to see what it's doing:
 - There is some text "We never save your data", but it is commented out so that it doesn't display
 - The field that you type the address into sends its contents off to the server every time it is changed! Not just when you click submit. Presumably this is designed to harvest private keys pasted by accident, etc.
 - There is a field labelled "Bitcoin Private Key Address", but it is commented out. Presumably this was meant to trick naive users into entering their private keys, but wasn't very effective so has been disabled.
 - The script 'data.js' inserts the address '1Mn6D9o2rutYVha2k9sYL3iHsRyyfhUbHG' into a hidden field in the form. It's received 1.2 BTC in total, from 91 transactions:  Ouch.
 - It looks like as soon as you click on the input box to paste your address, that click triggers the action of inserting that address into the form, and then rewriting the clipboard contents.
It could be a bit more sophisticated. There has been malware in the past that comes with a hardcoded list of hundreds of thousands of addresses, and replaces your clipboard contents with an address that begins with the same string, so that a casual visual check won't notice anything is wrong: 
EDIT: The site also has a copy of the bitaddress paper wallet generator, except it posts the private key off to their server after generating it.

You're right, I had missed the part where the coins had moved.


The only way to interact with their service is to use their web page. Any time you login, they could ship malicious code that exfiltrates your keys instead of working securely. Even if blockchain.com works exactly as described, and no keys are stored server-side (which I believe), you're trusting blockchain.com *almost* as much as you're trusting Coinbase. The exceptions are that blockchain.com don't have any identifying information that could get stolen, and they only have access to your keys while you're logged in. But if they at one time decide they want access to your keys forever, they just need to wait until you next login and then they can get them.

Gotcha! Incentivising people not only to route through me, but *to open a channel with me for the purpose of routing through me*.
EDIT: However, I'm not sure whether negative fees make it possible for other people to deliberately drain my money. Let's say you set up 2 nodes that I can't tell both belong to you. You route a payment from your first node to your second node, via my node. You don't charge yourself anything in fees, and I give you free money. Now do it in the opposite direction to put your channel balances back (and collect some more free money). Do enough rounds of this and you've stolen all of my channel's funding.

So you continued to generate addresses for, and receive payments into, the same wallet for 2 weeks?
Did the payment that disappeared ever show up in your wallet?
If not, it can't have been as simple as "this was address 21 of the derivation limit", because then it would have at least appeared in your wallet before disappearing.
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:45:10


That's not what I want! I want to shift the channel capacity so that I can receive payments, but I don't want to do that by just giving away free money. Unless I'm still misunderstanding?

How does BTCPay Server make other people fund channels to you?
@_date: 2018-08-28 10:41:05
Good info, thank you.
Creating incoming capacity by making payments is only viable if I spend more money than I make, which is not a viable business.
The "WILL_CONNECT_BACK" node sounds helpful, thanks. I'm opening a channel with him.
Lightning Conductor also sounds helpful, I hadn't considered such a service could exist. It works by creating "incoming capacity", but returning the coins to you so you can still use them, great idea. Unfortunately their wallet is "low on funds" at the moment.
I don't want to force the first Lightning customers to create a channel to me manually as that is quite a poor user experience.
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:55:57


Of course. I understood this part.
The part I was struggling with was how anybody would be able to pay me when nobody has funded a channel that pays to me.
I've gathered that the short-term solution is to list my node id on the page where people can pay me, and ask them to open a channel to me if their payment fails because no route exists. The long-term solution is that clients will fund channels automatically.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:51:00
For lnd it's `lncli listchannels`, and you can look at local_balance and remote_balance. For c-lightning it's `lightning-cli listpeers` and you have to look at msatoshi_total and spendable_msatoshi to work out what the balance on each side is.

Why did you change the address?
@_date: 2018-08-28 19:09:01
That initially sounds good, but doesn't actually help. For a payment to route through me, it needs to traverse channel A on the way in and channel B on the way out.
I lose the same amount in incoming capacity on channel A as I gain on channel B, apart from the extra fee, but I could get the same net resulting incoming cacacity by simply paying money to someone in return for nothing.
Routing a payment shifts your incoming capacity from one place to another, it doesn't increase it.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:35:23

Thanks. I didn't know that Chrome Extensions were such an active attack vector.
Also I would guess that the average user browsing over TOR is also using Bitcoin over TOR. If not, they should be...
Does the payment protocol require the r attribute to be https? If not, an Onion URL with plain http would be just as good.
If the r attribute requires https then I think I agree that disabling the r attribute for Onion site users is probably best.
Not a huge priority like you said, but it does solve the Chrome Extension attack vector and I can't see any obvious downside, so I do plan to do it eventually.
EDIT: From what I can see, the Payment Protocol doesn't *require* the r field to be https, so a plain-http Onion URL ought to work. I'll do a user survey to see how many of the Onion site users are also using Bitcoin over TOR, and act accordingly. Thanks for your help.

Interesting idea. It could even send an exact amount of BTC, and just put the excess in fees, to try to minimise the total cost to you.
I guess this would only be an improvement in cases where it's cheaper to pay a little more fee per byte than to increase the size of the transaction by a few tens of bytes, so probably negligible.

How is the method you describe better than just sending all 12 payments upfront?
If you are crafting the transactions upfront, you need to commit funds to them individually. A better recurring payment system would be if you could use each month's income to pay the next month's expenses, without having to manually pay each one.
I don't think it's a huge deal, just don't bother buying things you can't be bothered to pay for.

My understanding is that most of Google's work was in finding 2 prefixes that hash to the same thing and that this makes it easier to generate other (longer) strings that hash to the same thing.
As in, the few hundred bytes in the transaction both have the same hash (but different to that of the actual PDFs). But they can be shorter than the PDFs generated by Google because nobody cares if they actually render anything.

Electrum needs to query by Bitcoin address, but bitcoind only indexes by block and txid.
AFAIK, the electrum server is basically just an address index on top of bitcoind.
@_date: 2017-02-10 05:44:58
I get that. I just want to know if there are any obvious knobs to tweak to avoid making it easy for others to double-spend 0-conf transactions (e.g. the nSequence limit for Bitcoin Core's non-replaceability).
I already found out that Electrum generates transactions that are hard to double spend.
So I would either like to learn how to check that a transaction is this hard to double spend (I think the nSequence limit is the only factor here), or I would like to learn how to easily double spend transactions so that I know not to accept them.
Perhaps the best thing to do is start accepting them with the limitations I came up with, and then if any significant amount of fraud starts happening just stop accepting them.

It depends how strongly the secret is hidden in the output image. I have an image steganography tool here: 
If you set "hidden bits" high enough that you can actually *see* the hidden image in the output, then the scanner can see it too and can probably do a fair job of reproducing it.
You won't get a 100% reconstruction, but depending on what you're hiding it might work well enough.
In general though, no, you can't see anything with a scanner that you can't see with your own eyes. If it's hidden well enough that your eyes can't see it, your scanner probably won't either.

I emailed the Royal Mint about this last time it came up, and they didn't answer any of my questions. Here were my questions:
 
- are there any electronics inside the coin?
- how does the high-security feature work?
- can I have a sample coin to inspect?
And here's the response I got:
    Dear Mr Stanley
    
    The Royal Mint’s High Security Feature offers protection for currency systems based on a new generation of coin, 
    which can be 100% authenticated via high-speed automated detection units.
    
    The technology that The Royal Mint has adopted in its High Security Feature has been used in other sectors, 
    such as the banknote industry, for a number of years and has now been successfully transferred to metal and 
    coinage for the first time by The Royal Mint’s team of expert engineers.  
    
    Unfortunately we are not able to release further details as this is commercially sensitive information.
    
    Samples will only be issued to industry stakeholders who require them for upgrading coin handling equipment 
    and who agree to the terms and conditions of use.
    
    To request samples, please provide an overview of your business and outline the reasons for needing the samples 
    to newonepoundcoin

How will that work though? You can only mine blocks that include so many transactions, regardless of the fees you charge. No miner can allow more transactions to go through simply by including transactions with lower fees (except in cases where they're deliberately underfilling blocks to exclude transactions with low fees).
You aren't paying high fees because miners are screwing you over. You're paying high fees because that's what the market has decided it is worth to send a Bitcoin transaction.

That doesn't sound like a good idea at all: it means you get less money than you could have got, and it means users who are keen for their transactions to get confirmed quickly can't even pay more to make it happen. Nobody's a winner.

Sorry, the article assumes you already know why you want to generate QR codes :)
Imagine you're operating a web service (like  that takes Bitcoin payments. You generate Bitcoin addresses to receive payment and show the addresses to users
But some of the users want to browse the site on their computer but pay with a mobile phone, so rather than copy and paste the Bitcoin address they would rather scan a QR code. To do this you can just generate a QR code for "bitcoin:1bitcoinaddresshere" and display it next to where you display the address. Then they can scan the QR code on their phone and pay you.
But if you're not careful about how you serve the images of the QR codes, you can inadvertently leak information about which Bitcoin addresses belong to your service. And that's what the article is about.

Yes. Specifically, it is held as there separate UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) which only become inputs when you spend them.

It's not luck. It's a continuous process of judging and measuring. If you always act to minimise your exposure in case things go maximally bad, you could be limiting your chances of things going maximally well.
In this experiment, my maximum exposure to double-spends, although non-zero, was not unlimited. It was (and remains) 0.1 BTC. I'll automatically stop accepting 0-conf payments if ever there are 0.1 BTC of unconfirmed payments.
@_date: 2017-03-29 17:47:00

How many people who sold on MtGox for this price actually managed to withdraw any money? 0. They weren't selling it for real money, they were selling for Gox dollars, redeemable nowhere.
The only reason the price on Gox was so high is because the only way to get any money out was to spend your Gox dollars on BTC and withdraw that.
There were other exchanges back then, and they had lower ATH's than Gox, because they allowed withdrawals.
When Gox paused fiat withdrawals, I got majorly scared and withdrew almost all of my funds. But to do that I had to spend my fake Gox dollars on BTC, which pushes the price up even more. I certainly wasn't the only one to do this. But since they were insolvent, when too many people did this, they ran out of BTC as well and then went bust.

This future exists. It exists today. Many of the people in r/bitcoin *do* live in this future today. Of course, it depends on your business. Of course, if your business has razor-thin margins and operates in a market where all expenses are paid in fiat, switching to Bitcoin won't help you. That's fine.
But that doesn't make the rest of us wrong, and you'll be joining us in the future soon enough anyway :).

Were you the buyer or the seller? How has your 1K "gone"?
If you sent USD and the seller didn't release the Bitcoins, then LBC still have the Bitcoins and should be able to help.
If you released BTC and the seller didn't send any USD, then they won't do anything. Escrow exists for a reason, LBC aren't really in the wrong here.
If you released BTC and the seller sent USD but then the USD disappeared from your bank account, then it's possible the seller sent the funds from a stolen bank account, or has asked their own bank to reverse the transaction. In either case, the best you can do is tell LBC what happened, with evidence, and they should ban the seller's account.
The fact that LBC aren't cooperating (based on what you said) implies that it was the second case, i.e. you released BTC when you shouldn't have, and despite the large warning box they give you.

A much more practical attack is to generate tons of private keys, in insecure ways, and see if a corresponding public key appears on the blockchain.
The only "theoretically possible" way to work backwards from a public key to a private key is to iterate over the space of all private keys and find the one that matches your public key. Any improvement on that would mean the cryptography involved is broken.

But if you're the only person reducing the blocksize, there isn't much increased fee pressure. It only works if everybody is forced to reduce their blocksize at once, otherwise there is a strong incentive for a "rogue" miner to start mining full-size blocks again to get the extra fees.
I agree that reducing the blocksize by 30% would reduce income by less than 30%, but voluntarily *soft-limiting* your blocks to 30% lower would reduce your income a lot more than if the blocksize were truly reduced (albeit not by 30% - you'd pick the 70% of transactions paying the highest fees).

Cute film, and you obviously produced it in advance, but really, almost everyone is inside the monastery, and they can hear a lot of shouting outside, but it turns out it's just a handful of guys and they don't actually have any arrows.
There have been 29 blocks since the forking point and Bitcoin Cash is still yet to mine any. I suspect nobody is actually hashing until the difficulty adjustment (why bother, right? the difficulty will come down soon). I'm not sure what the equilibrium is here, but it might involve nobody ever doing any hashing.

The intermediate transactions (that don't get broadcast at all when both parties follow the protocol) allow the other party to spend “your” money a lot sooner than you can, but only if they know your secret, which they find out as part of the protocol for agreeing to update the balances of the channel.

No. Firstly because Bitcoin volatility has slowly been going down, so such a drastic crash is extremely unlikely. Second because I don't keep more wealth in BTC than I am comfortable with. If it goes up too high I'd sell some, of course.


When I first bought Bitcoin it wasn't to use it. I was playing on MtGox because I had heard that they had a trading API you could use. I had wanted to use trading APIs on "real" stock markets but the barrier to entry was too high. After I played with the trading API a bit, and lost a bit of money, I started reading up on what Bitcoin is and that is what got me really interested.
I suspect lots of the people buying Bitcoin to try and make a quick buck will also eventually read up more and realise it is the best system of money the world has ever seen, and then they'll start using it.


Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the biggest and most active. It has orders of magnitude more merchants. Compared to fiat currencies, I refer you to the answer I gave before:
"Firstly, what is so great about Bitcoin? Anybody can pay anybody, anywhere in the world, any amount of money, without trusting any third-party and without asking any third-party for permission. That's fucking huge. That has never existed before. If you want to accept Bitcoin payments, you just run a bitcoin node and do it. Processing payments is as easy as running a http server. The other great thing about Bitcoin is that your local central bank has no ability to simply create more of it and deplete the value of your savings. That's also fucking huge. It has existed before (e.g. gold) but not in a form that can be securely transferred digitally without trust+permission." 


I think there's going to be a crash as well. Unfortunately I think there's quite a lot more life in this current bubble before we get there. Historically each bubble has "crashed" down to a level higher than it was when it started, so I'm not concerned for the long term. But you're right that some people are going to lose lots of money in this bubble.

This is not how fees work. The fees don't come out of what the receiver receives, they get added on to what the sender sends. In your scenario, the receiver still gets $42, but it costs the sender $59.

Thanks for your advice! I'm not using an HD wallet. I wanted to use an HD wallet at first but found it too much of a pain - I might conceivably have to generate hundreds of addresses in a row which don't receive a payment, and I didn't want to risk not being able to find any payments.
I'm not making vanity addresses, I just use vanitygen as a quick and dirty way to generate new addresses, and I store the public address in the database, and the private key for that address on the disk (encrypted, with the private key for the encryption not kept on the server). You're right that if somebody compromised the server they would be able to steal *future* payments, but it should hopefully mean that past payments are still safe even if I haven't yet swept them.
Having a bunch of address/key pairs generated offline and then assigned to accounts as needed is an interesting idea! Although it still doesn't defend against somebody compromising future payments: regardless of how I generate addresses, they can just modify the app to display their own address to users instead of the correct address.

If everyone is relying on this satellite in order to receive blocks, they get to decide if they don't want a block to be allowed.
If a block includes a transaction they don't like, they can just not broadcast it and then nobody will see it.

My service (  ) handles payments itself.
It uses vanitygen to generate addresses, then encrypts (with RSA) the private keys and writes them to disk. It uses electrum in a minutely cron to check for new payments.
Periodically I copy the encrypted private keys to my laptop, where I am able to decrypt them and sweep the balances into my wallet.
A bit "Rube Goldberg" perhaps, but it means I don't have to trust a third-party paymentsservice , and I don't have to run a full node.

Brilliant stuff, I am enjoying following along.
I'm having trouble with section 3.2 "Bitcoin Transaction Outputs as Single-Use-Seals"
I think I understand that a Bitcoin transaction spending the currently-open "seal" includes an OP_RETURN value containing a hash of the message, and that the "Next seal" header of the message points to a UTXO to be used as the next open seal.
But what do the "Solvency" headers correspond to?
Ctrl-f for "534a405f376cd55c7cd41676dd728a729d0c536385e2e6e0beb7257bac752c01" shows no more occurrences, and I'm at a loss as to what it might mean.
Think I've figured it out: the hash that is committed to by the Bitcoin transaction is the hash of the headers, and the Solvency header is the hash of the solvency message.
Still not sure why the "Next seal" can't just be part of the actual message, and then we skip the header layer, and just include a hash of the solvency message (which now includes a commitment to the "Next seal") in the OP_RETURN?

If you buy a bunch of mining equipment and do some mining, yes, that's a venture.
But what you bought in order to carry out the venture was a bunch of mining equipment, not a bunch of BTC.
If someone bought shares in your mining company, or gave you some money today in exchange for a percentage of future profits of your mining company, they probably bought a security.
If you bought BTC and expected to earn a return simply from owning BTC, then you're getting closer to the realm of buying a security. In order for it to be regulated as a security, I imagine the BTC would have to have originated from some single entity, and for there to be some venture that the BTC-originating entity is carrying out that is supposed to earn a return. Since that's quite obviously not how Bitcoin works, BTC in and of itself is not a security.

Read it again. If there is a *promise of a return* from *one specific entity* then it is a security.

If you give me money to buy my magical internet tokens that exist outside the context of any specific company, investment scheme, etc., then you can hardly be said to have been investing in my company. If I haven't promised you any return, and haven't promised to invest the USD you gave me in to any particular endeavour, then you haven't bought anything analogous to shares in my company, and you haven't bought a security. You've just bought some token. Seems reasonable to me.

I'm not sure whether you're trolling or just new to Bitcoin, so I'll assume the latter as I'm aware there are a lot of new people in r/bitcoin at the moment.
Firstly, what is so great about Bitcoin? Anybody can pay anybody, anywhere in the world, any amount of money, without trusting any third-party and without asking any third-party for permission. That's fucking huge. That has never existed before. If you want to accept Bitcoin payments, you just run a bitcoin node and *do it*. Processing payments is as easy as running a http server. The other great thing about Bitcoin is that your local central bank has no ability to simply create more of it and deplete the value of your savings. That's also fucking huge. It has existed before (e.g. gold) but not in a form that can be securely transferred digitally without trust+permission.
Secondly, *how* do I use Bitcoin?
If I want to buy *anything*, and there exists a merchant that takes Bitcoin payment, I buy from that merchant. Since my income is in Bitcoin, this is most convenient to me. Long wait times are not a problem. Did you know Visa payments don't clear for 60 days? Many merchants accept 0-conf payments in most cases. I do. BitPay does.
For merchants that don't take Bitcoin, most take Visa. I have a Xapo debit card. On Xapo the balance is stored in BTC and is only converted at the time of sale. It's just like having a USD Visa card and spending to a merchant that takes a non-USD currency. It's pretty hassle-free, but you're back to the old method of trusting and asking permission.
Transaction fees aren't an issue for me. I've made a lot more money by accepting Bitcoin payments than I would have if I didn't accept Bitcoin payments. If I lose a percent or so when spending that money, that doesn't make a meaningful difference. That's just the cost of using the best monetary system in the world. And if you took payment in Visa, you'd lose the fees at the time you received the money. It doesn't make much difference in the long run.

That is non-sensical.
Increasing the amount of fees available in the mempool is good for all miners. But including transactions that are already available in the mempool is good for the individual miner.

It is very easy for a merchant to check whether the transaction has RBF enabled, and wait for confirmations if it does. It is also very easy for a merchant to wait for confirmations if the amount is too large, or if the cumulative amount of unconfirmed payments is too large, or if the fee is too low.
Source: am a merchant accepting 0-conf transactions. There have been a couple of double spends but the amount gained by making payments quicker for users vastly outweighs the loss due to double spends. The double spends that did happen occurred while fees were high and the mempool was chock full of unconfirmed transactions. I believe they were mistakes rather than malicious.

I don't think it is far-fetched. We have no idea how many keys are generated by this application. If it handles lots of bitcoin data (e.g. blockchain.info), most of its used-and-then-freed memory is probably full of data from the blockchain. If it generates lots of keys (e.g. blockchain.info) using uninitialised memory, then it's quite conceivable that 1 in every 100,000 (pulled out of my arse) happen to be hashes of data from the bitcoin blockchain.
Point is, we have no idea how many other keys have been generated by this application that *aren't* trivially discoverable like this. We only get to see the weak ones, and we don't know with what probability it generates weak ones.

Thanks, that sounds very plausible. fitwear could have tried to import the "same" key in 2 different ways without realising what he'd done, and ended up burnt by that.
EDIT: In fact the blockchain.info UI for importing a private key is called "import address" and the button says "import bitcoin address" and the modal dialog says "Import Existing Bitcoin Address" and private keys are only mentioned in fineprint. I just tried typing an address in the box (that the UI very strongly implies I should type an address into) and it tells me it'll import it as a watch-only address, and it does seem to work that way. There is every possibility that the "watch-only" logic is recent, or there was a bug in it at one point that imported it as a brainwallet, or even just that fitwear went running off to work out how to get a private key for an address and messed it up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:19:03
It certainly could be malicious, but without seeing a smoking gun I think it's unfair to jump to conclusions. We don't even know that it *is* caused by hashing uninitialised memory instead of random bytes, and even if it is there is any number of legitimate ways for such a vulnerability to exist (and be found by an attacker) without the attacker planting the code deliberately.

I have no idea about the actual process that would most likely be followed, but it sounds to me like the result so far is almost purely mathematical. There would be lots of engineering work to do before it could become a BIP (basically converting from a mathematical argument into a specification of a protocol that implements it, and convincing everybody that the specification implements it correctly, and working out how to integrate it with the existing Bitcoin network.). That specification would then become a BIP. I expect.

There are lots of other people day-trading on GDAX. What you have to ask is whether you have any advantage over the average market participant. If you can't work out what advantage you have, you will lose money. If you can convince yourself that you have an advantage, you will probably lose money anyway, but it might at least be worth trying.
Note that even if you have an advantage over the "average" participant, the well-informed participants will exploit your weaknesses unless you are about as good as they are. C.f. adverse selection:

Very interesting. From reading this, I really like the look of the Cryptosteel Capsule.
The Cryptosteel Capsule is good because it is all stainless steel, making it well-hardened against fire and water, and the inside of it is sealed, which means for \*anything\* to actually damage the data, it would have to break through the outer case first.
The design is both attractive and easy to manufacture. This is a really well-designed product, in my opinion. Unfortunately at €89 it is a bit expensive.
So I've just been on eBay and bought myself some stuff to make one of these on my own. I've got a bunch of stainless steel bar stock (303 stainless steel, apparently), some M3 washers (A2), and some M3 threaded rod (A2).
I'm going to bore a hole up the middle of the bar stock and tap an M12 thread in the opening, make a little lid for it with a matching M12 male thread and an M3 female thread up the middle, stamp my seed letters onto the washers, and then slide the washers onto the threaded rod, with a retaining nut at the end. The M3 rod then threads up the inside of the lid, which then threads onto the capsule sealing the whole thing up. It should be functionally equivalent to the Cryptosteel Capsule, except I've only spent £14 on materials.
To guard against water ingress (not that it matters too much on stainless), I intend to bore a recess in the top of the capsule to put an O-ring around the lid seal, and to guard against the thread seizing I intend to put some copper grease or similar on the M12 thread before sealing it up. I'm looking forward to this.
If you were giving one to somebody who doesn't have access to workshop tools, it might be worth milling some flats on the lid and the body so that they have half a chance of undoing a seized thread with a pair of spanners.
One of the difficulties with a Cryptosteel Capsule-like design is that you need to read the letters off the face of the washers, without removing the retention mechanism from the rod. If you spill the washers all over the floor, your money is gone., so it's probably worth adding plenty of extra space to the threaded rod so that when you need to recover the seed, you can back the nut off (to slide the washers around and read the faces) without allowing the washers to be removed from the rod.

Don't you think somebody tampering with the program would also remove the "eval whatever the server sends us" feature?

**See EDIT3. This program is basically confirmed malicious.**
Why does it need to verify that its contents are not tampered with? Is there any interest in a modified version that does not verify that its contents are not tampered with?
EDIT: To de-tamperproof the script, find the line that says "sub quine", and insert
    return '259205f75eb1bc8b6e58ffeb27a354ef';
right after the opening curly brace. Then you can tamper with the file however you want.
EDIT2: Interestingly, the death_kiss() function doesn't actually seem to work as intended - I think it is supposed to exit when invoked, but all it does is output "DEATH KISS" and then carry on.
**EDIT3: Here is the malicious part (line 2187)**:
    if
    (
    defined
    $answer
    -&gt;
    {eval}
    )
    {
    eval
    $answer
    -&gt;
    {eval}
    ;
    }
**This is arbitrary code execution of whatever the server tells it to execute.**
EDIT4: The de-tamperproofing I initially posted is not sufficient. Although I obviously do not recommend running the script, you also need to change inside the h160_inject function:
    eval
    xor2oct(
    $config{testdata}
    -&gt;
    {h160}
    )
This eval's an alternative piece of code that computes the md5 of the file. Probably just replace those lines with `$quine`. There might be more places it tries to calculate its own md5 hash as well.
I don't like how user-hostile this program is, and I certainly don't like the blatant, deliberate, arbitrary remote code execution. I agree with OP: this program is malicious.
EDIT5: There's more! Line ~157:
    LWP::UserAgent
    -&gt;
    new(
    ssl_opts =&gt;
    {
    verify_hostname =&gt;
    0
    }
    ,
    )
So, in addition to executing whatever it gets told to execute, it doesn't even verify that it's talking to the right server? Anybody can MITM this program and inject *their own* arbitrary code to execute.

If you're going to ship code that contains arbitrary remote code execution, you need to say so upfront.

Even if it does nothing malicious yet, there is no way to know what it's going to do in the future.

I've updated the site so it shows "landline" or "mobile" on the page where you go to buy a number. I don't actually have access to any mobile numbers in NL at this point, I'm sorry I can't do more. I intend to add support for a second API provider, hopefully that will open up a wider selection of numbers.
Thanks for your interest in the service.

I bought a Cryptopay debit card not long ago, and I wrote a review of it. My main complaint was that the card was a generic-looking grey one instead of a branded black one. Lots of people replied saying Xapo is better, and specifically that Xapo give branded cards.
Well I ordered a Xapo card and it arrived yesterday. Guess what? It's a generic-looking grey one, identical to the Cryptopay one. What a scam. I'm waiting for Xapo support to reply to me. Part of the Xapo card buying process includes a screen saying "this is what the card will look like" showing a nicely-branded black card, so I'm very disappointed to have received a generic-looking grey one.

I started working on it around 13:16 (based on the timestamp of the directory I was working in). I swept the first key at 14:34, so about 1h15 to get the first one. I swept the last key at 15:47 so about 2h30 in total.
I only read about them a few days ago, too, otherwise I think I'd have been able to crack them much sooner.
All it really took was actually paying attention to the image and working out what's going on. How many different colours are there? Why is there a blue brick in every 4th place? Why does the pattern repeat at exactly 120 bricks? Then it's just a case of accurately copying down the colours into a text file, forming hypotheses about the encoding, and writing quick and dirty scripts to decode it until you get the correct idea.

Ah, I thought you were surprised that people would want to use Bitcoin.
I like eBay because it's just so convenient. One-click checkout, lots of price competition between different sellers, even the most obscure chemicals, electronics parts, car parts, anything you want to buy. It's all available for sale from the same place, with the same search system, and the same checkout UI.
No entering shipping or billing details, no signing up for an account, no confusion about how it works (once you've done it once, of course). It is always the same, no matter what you're buying or who you're buying it from.
It's what I hope OpenBazaar can one day replace.

People keep stating this, but I refuse to accept that the average person simply doesn't understand fractional values.
I don't know why people say it, but it is just not an issue. It wouldn't matter if 1/10 as many BTCs existed and the price was 10x as high. And *everybody* understands this.
@_date: 2016-09-09 14:37:47
I have no idea I'm afraid! It simply passes on the phone numbers from the API provider. I'll try and look into that for you.
EDIT: I understand the question now. You're talking about the part after the country code. It's because the API provider can give landline numbers as well as mobile ones. You should still be able to send+receive SMS using those numbers. If that's not working please send me an email and I'll investigate, and probably give you a refund.

I also think SMS Privacy doesn't enable anything that isn't already possible if you apply enough effort (e.g. travel around your country using prepaid debit cards, buying prepaid SIMs and burner phones).
SMS Privacy is just putting the capability to remain anonymous into the hands of everybody, rather than only those who are sufficiently-well motivated/funded.

Sure, and Bitcoin is nonsense because Visa lets you make instant online payments.
Github is a single point of trust in the system you describe. Every time you move to a new machine, or want to share the tool with a friend, they either have to get it off github and trust github, or get it off github and have a known-good commit sha to check against, or get it off you.
The only way which is safe against a malicious/compromised source is having a known-good hash to verify. If you have a known-good hash, you don't need to care whether it comes from github or anybody else. IPFS is basically a way to locate a source of content for a known-good hash.
Instead of distributing content and hashes and getting users to verify the hash, you just distribute the hash and IPFS takes care of sourcing + verifying the content.

If you use it straight from github, you have to trust github *every time you use it*.
If you download it from github and store the content yourself, you only trust github once, but you need to retain access to it, and make sure it is not compromised.
If you download it from github and store it on ipfs, you only trust github once, and then you can access it via the ipfs url from anywhere in the world without trusting anyone. And even if you don't want to download the ipfs client for whatever reason, you can use a public gateway of your choice, and then your trust exposure is no *worse* than just blindly trusting github.
It's sometimes better than using github, and sometimes equivalent.
I can't understand why you are so against it. It's not worse in any way...
EDIT: But I'm quite sure I'm not going to change your mind, so could you please explain your position on IPFS:
1.) IPFS is uninteresting
2.) IPFS is interesting but non-useful until integrated in all browsers
3.) IPFS is great and doesn't need full browser integration, but the specific application to Bitaddress.org doesn't make sense

The money isn't actually gone until it's in a block. Unfortunately clients (my client, at least) make it difficult to double spend, or to delete unconfirmed transactions, so I'm not sure what happens from a user experience perspective.
But from the technical side, the money is still yours, and you can craft a new transaction to spend it.

This is not how a replay attack works.
A replay attack is where transactions intended for one chain get replayed on the other. E.g. if you're trying to spend just BIP148 coin, but your Legacy coin moves as well.
It can be harmful, but it doesn't allow you to create extra coins.

I guess the question is how exactly timelocked transactions work. Does it mean it can't be included in a block until the timelock is expired? Or does it mean it can be included in a block but doesn't have any effect until the timelock is expired?
If the former, then the timelocked cheat transaction can't get into a block before the timelock is expired. And the anti-cheat transaction can only be spent after the cheat transaction is revealed.
So the cheating miner just waits for the timelock to expire, and then mines a block containing the cheat transaction, giving the anti-cheat transaction no chance to get mined.
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:19:07

Ask yourself where the security comes from in such a system.
My understanding is you must do a few seconds' worth of proof-of-work in every transaction. But that means anyone with, say, a rack of servers and a few hours to spare is able to out-pace all of the proof-of-work of any legitimate transaction, and therefore censor transactions, rewrite history, or double spend.
IOTA does not have automatic peer discovery, which means everyone has to connect to a node they trust, which in practice means one of a small handful of centralised nodes. The reason for this is that if it had automatic peer discovery, the above would be problems. So in reality, as deployed today, IOTA is a centralised system of cryptographic transaction validation, masquerading as a decentralised one.

You don't have to install a special client to benefit from it. If Segwit gets activated because of Segwit2x, it gets activated whether you personally are running that client or not.
You can just keep running core or BIP148 or whatever you want, and if Segwit activates, you get Segwit.

You won't need a special wallet. Non-SegWit transactions continue to be valid, they just won't be as cheap as SegWit transactions.
You should never keep coins on an exchange except for active trading. They can get hacked, they can get shutdown by authorities, they can run away with the money, they can deny you access to the money because they don't believe you're who you say you are.
No business lasts forever, and as far as I know no Bitcoin exchange has ever closed down in a way that didn't result in customers losing money.

These are hostnames. When your node doesn't know any other nodes (e.g. the first time you start it), it connects to (some or all of?) the "DNS Seed" nodes to bootstrap itself onto the network.
This commit (on the btc1 repo, *not* the Bitcoin Core repo) changes from a bunch of seed nodes operated by some individuals who (probably) run Bitcoin Core or BIP148, to a bunch of seed nodes operated by some companies who (will eventually) run btc1.
Here's the latest list on the Bitcoin Core repo: 
The parameter at the end that has been changed from true to false in btc1 is "supportsServiceBitsFiltering". It indicates whether or not that node supports "service bits filtering". I don't actually know what that is, but I guess it says whether the node is able to keep separate views of the Bitcoin network based on which service bits people are setting, and only connect you to nodes which agree with you.
EDIT: I'm wrong. Service bits are things like "this node supports bloom filtering". Certain clients require certain services from nodes they connect to, so service bits filtering means the node will only introduce you to other nodes which support the services you require.

If it's "in transit" that means it's unconfirmed, i.e. it doesn't appear in a block.
If it appears in a block before the BCC split, you'll get BCC with it.
If it appears in a block after the BCC split, you won't.
However, whether or not a replay attack will be able to get you the BCC will depend on whether Coinbase have managed to split their coins. If the transaction is broadcast before the split, they probably won't have been able to, so there's a fair chance you'll get the BCC anyway, but it's not guaranteed.

1.) SegWit isn't off-chain, SegWit is on-chain.
2.) Lightning transactions are off-chain. They are not the same as intra-exchange transactions until published, you got that wrong.
3.) Lightning comes with a whole bunch of crypto magic that I personally don't understand. The upshot is that if your counterparty tries to cheat, they implicitly reveal a secret that allows you to steal the entirety of the funds, and prevent them from cheating.
(But I did hear a convincing argument that if your counterparty is a *miner* and tries to cheat, they can put the cheat transaction in a block that they mine, thereby not giving you a chance to broadcast the anti-cheat transaction. I don't know if this is true).
@_date: 2017-07-29 09:58:33
Right. But just because BTC-e had some stolen MtGox Bitcoins doesn't mean everybody who had BTC on BTC-e has done something wrong.
Yes, it's risky to use an unregulated exchange. But generally the risk is "the people running the exchange will steal from you". Not "the US government will steal from you". Can you see the difference?
If I warn you that it's risky to use something, and then you use it anyway and I steal a bunch of money from you, it's not OK just because I warned you it was risky. That's protection-racket logic.

I think it's just a misunderstanding on the part of Peter Rizun.
It obviously takes 15 minutes to find a block with 2/3 of the hashrate. But the problem starts at t=-10 minutes.
I think they both got the right answer, but Craig Wright noticed that it starts at t=-10 and not at t=0.
EDIT: Changed my mind. I think Peter thinks that the block being mined at t=0 and kept hidden somehow affects the expected time for the rest of the network to mine a block. This is obviously false, I think Peter is just wrong.

Start with executing SHA256 on the empty string.
Once you've done that, run SHA256 on the output of the first one.
Once you've done that, use a Bitcoin block header as the input and run SHA256 on it twice.
Once you've done that, try billions of different nonce values until you get a block hash that is lower than the current difficulty target, and you've mined a block.

It's 1-(1-0.001)^20 = 1.98%, so in this case your calculation worked.
In general, the probability that the route fails is equal to 1 minus the probability that the entire route succeeds. The probability that the entire route succeeds is the probability that one hop succeeds, raised to the power of the number of hops (assuming failures are independent). The probability that one hop succeeds is 1 minus the probability that 1 hop fails.
It should be clear that 20*0.1% is not a sound calculation. :) What happens in a route with a million hops?

If you could reflow the original text to insert extra paragraphs (in a different colour, or otherwise differentiated) within the text I think that would help.

Pastebin isn't designed for that purpose, Pastebin is *abused* for that purpose, and they actively take down such content.

Yes technically there exist many keys per address, but you have no practical way to discover any of the other keys.

It is suspicious that OP is a 1-day-old account and many of the supporting comments are also from young accounts.
That said, I looked through the code in this repo and (at commit 011490e2b77ba491c3e791f60911c4ce208c5f1f) am convinced that the code in this repo doesn't do anything malicious.
It has 296 npm dependencies, I am currently having a look through them for anything obviously suspicious but have not yet found anything.
You should heed the advice in the README to only run this on a computer that will never again be connected to the internet. Even if the code in this repo is totally legit, entering (a near typo of) your private key into a maybe-compromised computer maybe-compromises the private key.
My only nitpick is it says "As the original WIF private key was found and shown on this device, it can no longer be considered safe" - but the key material became compromised the moment you input it, regardless of whether this program manages to find a solution.
EDIT: Didn't find anything malicious, but obviously haven't looked through it all. I'd say it's legit. As long as you only use it on a throwaway live system that never gets internet access you'll be fine either way.

I can't believe nobody has pointed this out already, but... I'm not sure you understand how percentages work.
If a number goes up 1000%, how many percent does it need to go down to get back where it started?
And if a number goes down 90%, how many percent must it go up to get back where it started?

If the people in control of the repo can ship a malicious bitcoin client, they can just as easily ship a kernel that will maliciously alter any bitcoin client it finds.
If you have to trust your distro packagers, you have to trust them. Even if you get your bitcoin client elsewhere.

I don't know anything about how this works, but I'd be interested in reading more about this.

The same can easily be true of Bitcoin, or anything. The daily trading volume can be many times higher than the amount of the thing in existence, because people can buy and sell the same thing multiple times per day.

Actually, full blocks correlates well with *high* transaction throughput (compared to non-full blocks). It's just not quite as high as we would all prefer :)

I didn't realise Xapo did a card, I'd heard the name on this sub but didn't know what they did, and they didn't come up in my searches for "uk bitcoin debit card" etc. They do appear to be cheaper than Cryptopay.

Can you elaborate on that? AFAIK, CPFP isn't actually a feature of any bitcoin implementation, it's just part of mining strategy

It's in an NFO file from a torrent. They'd find it hard to generate a unique bitcoin address in a static text file.

KYC was never meant to reduce the risk to the individual. It's meant to make it easier for governments to track people.

If everybody but the miners fork, the miners will be effectively mining an altcoin and nobody will be mining bitcoin. Mining becomes very profitable very quickly, and any miner with an ounce of common sense will start mining bitcoin again.

Remember the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. While what you say is true, it's no comfort to anybody who runs out of options before the billionaire runs out of money.

Why say " /Bitcoin.com/Bitcoin Unlimited" ? How is that anything but divisive? That's just as bad as conflating AXA with BlockStream with Bitcoin Core.

This anonymousbtcsms site has ripped off much of the text and HTML from my site. I've sent a payment and it isn't showing up. I think it is a scam where he copies the marketing text off a legit site, prices it slightly cheaper, and then just collects payments without providing any service.

I second this recommendation. "The Sovereign Individual" is a great read, and offers a very positive view of the future, if you're the type of person you're likely to be if you're interested in Bitcoin.

"Computer scientist" is a very strong word for what's being described here. He's certainly Australian though.

I wanted to add a side project of mine, but your site only allows "autehntication" with Twitter or LinkedIn, neither of which I use.
EDIT: The project is Hardbin: 
It's an encrypted pastebin with code+data stored in IPFS (  ) so nobody can modify it (e.g. in a traditional encrypted pastebin, the server operator can ship some javascript to exfiltrate the decryption key - that's not possible in Hardbin if you access it via a secure gateway, e.g. one you run yourself).
Currently Hardbin only supports text. I'd like to make it store arbitrary files but am struggling to find time.

This is FUD. A time-locked transaction is not valid until the time has passed, whether you're a miner or not. If you mine a block that contains a time-locked transaction before the lock timeout, the block is invalid and the rest of the network rejects your block.

I get what you're saying, but it's not much harder to create a Twitter account than an email account.
My email account is certainly linked to my identity much more strongly than any Twitter account would be :)
