An indicator. GBTC also.

Circle.com is a great choice. Then move to breadwallet or Copay.

Saw the AMA. You are doing great work. Just donated.

I find breadwallet very good at this.

I am in the UK and at the moment I get a around a £3 spread for 1 BTC. £565 buy and £562 sell. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:36:44
I'll give it a go:

My prediction: Bitcoin will be $2298.31 in 2017!

Please be careful. I did this around 1 month ago and it cost me a significant sum of money. It was a large transfer but as you noted the exchange rate is not clear and depending on the £ sum it can change. Because of this I changed my account denomination to BTC and keep it as BTC. When I need to move funds I then send BTC direct to Circle and then change the currency from BTC to £. This then shows the exchange for the wallet total. Apart from this experience Circle has been great.

Perhaps the iOS bitWallet app. They have a 'watch lists' feature that may be suitable.

On the iPhone App I go to the sell and enter in my total BTC to sell and it will show an exchange rate in the 'pricing' row. I then do the same with the buy. These values will change depending on the qty of BTC. The more BTC the lower the sell value and higher the cost to buy (as I have seen). My circle wallet is denominated in BTC. I have just checked now and the spread is £4 for 1 BTC and £6 for 3 BTC. I got caught out because I moved to stored BTC to my circle account which was denominated in £ and it accepted it but at a greatly reduced rate. I then had to buy the BTC back to move offline again. The spread cost me at that time more than 3 BTC.

Keep going Poker. I find your thoughts interesting, original and thoughtful. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 09:36:32
bitWallet is great for this. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 06:49:50
No worries. Yes, you need to add your card details. If you are using the App then there is a button saying 'Add Money'. Depending if your wallet is set to £ or btc you will then see the monies added in your denomination.

bitWallet is great at this.

I use bitWallet by creating a new wallet and then in this new wallet loading the required addresses. For me it is mainly watching my coins that are long term storage.

Great stuff. Selling btc is just as easy and there are no limits on cashing out. 
@_date: 2016-07-16 05:53:04
I enjoy reading your thoughts, especially over the last 6-9 months. Keep it up. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 12:10:35
Thanks for feedback. I am the same. I move straight out to breadwallet then onwards. I wonder if anyone has used this feature to limit the impact of price dips ? I have switched several times but for other reasons. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 12:12:43
Great to hear. How did you find the pricing ? I find this the cheapest option available outside of an exchange for the UK. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 05:52:07
I use circle all the time and it works great. I have had no problems to date. 
@_date: 2016-07-11 08:19:36
A quick question, can you confirm that if there is a price move your £ holdings stay the same or do they move with the btc price even if your wallet is set to £ ? 
@_date: 2016-07-11 06:32:25
I don't think there is. If you buy btc then it will go directly to your circle account. You can of course move it out again to another btc address.

Not that I know of. There are some features in the notification but not as you need.
