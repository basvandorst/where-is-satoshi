No, I really don't care about  satoshi gender. The 11 year old part maybe ,but really. Have fun with your continuous trolling.

Part of the problem with this is they it would not really increase the popularity of bitcoins among the majority of the population. At least in my local area(San Diego) there has been multiple hackathon themed with bitcoins
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:14:51
Sorry I didn't see that.I was trying to take a neutral approach but you seem to indicate I came off angry
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:38:19
I don't have many bitcoins but I want to know do you guys recomend create a new wallet on dark wallet and then transferring the bitcoins from my blockchain account
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:52:52
well whatever that is what he is executive director of.
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:57:36
Isn't there a separate bitcoin company called bitcoin though.Kinda similar to Mt Gox.Maybe he is the  executive director of that. 
Edit: I am right he is Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:55:07
hmm, valid point. I was more trying to say that I don't think hackathons will help bitcoins become more popular with the general public(though they do sometimes go to hackathons) which is needed if we want it to become more accepted.A good ammount of the programming population is already in support of bitcoins.I still think we should do hackathons but that will not help it become more popular.

as combined with that libertarian in itself is such a broad term that holds many different people with similar but pretty different opinions
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:15:29
Sorry for being a devils advocate, but in some way I feel that the judges thought bitcoin was just something she came up with. I feel like that wouldn't know much about it at least from my own experience sorry.
@_date: 2014-02-08 03:05:14
Yeah I guess,I am a bit sad about my karma on that post.I wonder if the people understood what bring a devil advocate is  or they didn't like what i said.Sorry for telling that to you.

I think if anything we should change it into a c ingrained in the B with the line going down through both 
@_date: 2014-01-23 01:45:46
I agree with your statement about them downvoting it because of it being  "bad" but I don't think the majority of the people on here are kids, in fact you seem to be acting the most like a kid out of anyone here.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:42:09
What do you personally think the bitcoin foundation needs to change in order for it to be more appreciated by the community and how have you done tried to change that
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:52:06
Valid point. I think we should do the hackathons but I didn't know anything about the UFC ad and just wanted to point out that it isn't the way to popularity

I have a couple blockchains as part of my chain of block that are in Blockchain Inc. Tbh though I still admit to falling up with use of blockchain mainly because I hear it most in reference to inc when people talk about Blockchain.

California. There are a bunch of people who know bitcoin but i am not sure they actualy understand anything about it.The news has not been informative 
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:19:09
I would say for a lot its both just like with any investment in emerging technology. They may desire to be rich through some form of investment but the reason they choose a specific one is because of nonfiancial factors. Sometimes over confidence too but there is a reason we a lot of people not trusting bitcoin enough to invest in it but still want to be rich through some kind of investment. The ones who do invest have a reason for choosing bitcoin.

 I get annoyed with people like this who have no understanding of libertarianism like people who think Tea Partiers and Libertarians are the same thing(and i have seen ignorance like this on reddit even though I love this community)
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:52:22
He was not using the wallet feature but the shared send feature as stated by a couple other people

wait you're a VC you should invest in my parents company called Predictably Well. They have gotten multiple awards for their product but have not been able to do as much as they know they could if they had the money. Not trying to gain suport just ranting though they would love it.

If someone actually wants to create a website using this as a donation source or earn coins from visitors how do you di that(like which plugins and installation) also what is the best way to actually earn something and the investments needed
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:58:42
lol that would be epic but that would mean that the value of bitcoins would be about $279,329 
@_date: 2013-10-19 05:15:50
Youd think when you hear about bitcoins they would be something small but when you check out their value there is nothing bit about them.
