Think he does a fine job of slandering and misquoting himself buddy.

You don't know a ton of people that are against the education system, and if you do, that's not the norm. There's not a single political party that wants to remove state financed education. Some parties want more money, and some less, but nothing extreme.
What society has survived without taxes?

I just told you that they're not the norm as there is not a single political party that goes against the educational system. Reading comprehension is hard, right?
I didn't confuse the two, I asked which society survived without taxes, not states. I guess another way to ask is which societies have survived without a state. Again, not that hard to understand, but I guess you didn't have the money for good education. Maybe we should fix that.

I mean I guess if you generally believe in free will and that a person can just do whatever they want to do completely disregarding their upbringing and environment then sure. There's a reason why the American social mobility rate is one of the worst in the world. And it's not because poor people just decide to not teach themselves to program, it's because they don't have access to the same opportunities in life. (Look at Pierre Bourdieu's theories)

Just look at the social mobility rate in the US. It's one of the worst in the world.
Education isn't a hobby. That just goes to show how you think.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:21:50
And what is the big picture that it misses? Why are free education a bad idea? How should worse off people get an education? Why is the us education system so fucked compared to other countries? Oh, and don't come and say that the US is the home of many top universities as that is totally irrelevant since the average joe has no access to those.

The graph shows exactly what I believe it does. It shows social mobility. That means the ease of moving through financial groups. It means that it's extremely hard if you're poor in America to get out of poverty. This means that it's a lottery if you're going to have a shitty or great life, and that shouldn't be the case IMO. In the US if you're born in a worse off situation you can't go to any good colleges unless you're an amazing individual that can get a scholarship. That's extremely wrong. I know that the bitcoin is a bit of a libertarian biased community, nothing wrong with that, but I just don't think it's based on reality. People can't just choose to get out of poverty, they need the best environment for it. Which education is one of the best way to do so.

You have linked the same link as in your original comment, and not once does it say he owns bCash, and even if he did, it must be available info other than in a rage interview.

Losing a potential 90k is a lot worse than losing a potential 9k that he got for free. That said, splitting it half and half would be my advice too.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:11:14
I really doubt that. I wanted to buy some bitcoin today, but with the high fees there are no need. You need to buy If you buy 200 dollars you have to get around 20% just to go even with the fees and if you buy even less than 200 then it's basically impossible.

What do3s Bitcoin have to offer over other altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:24:58
That seems incredibly naive. Being raised in a rich home with a probably great work ethic and lessons to learn from their parents. Someone who will bail them out if they lose all their money, and someone who will pay for their education. Their childhood and upbringing is 99,99% the reason they are where they are. It may have been their "mental horsepower", but they probably got that from their childhood too.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:26:42
Again, incredibly naive outlook. Of course that has everything to do with it. Do you think an uneducated person would know how to program or know anything about finances? Of course not. Albeit this discussion is a bit useless considering everyone is affected by their social heritage. Have you read about Pierre Bourdieu and his theories about social capital? Should read up on it.

People don't fail to see this. They just realize that it's much better Bill Gates pay for my education than myself when I have no time to earn a lot of money.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:28:17
Same, but with 80 bucks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:18:17
Where do you see that Roger Ver created bCash? Not in his wiki or the wiki of bCash.

The only one not cheating on taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:08:28
You're stating the obvious. People just think that education should be free when you take it, and you pay it back when you've got a job that pays better because you've got a higher education. That and the well off people can easily afford to pay for education but the worse off can't.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:34:18
I live in Denmark where no one disagrees with the fact that education should be free so those are the "people" I talk about since the OP brought up that people fail to see it.
Well if a majority agreed on Brexit why should I be forced to leave the EU, if a "majority" agreed to Trump then why should I be forced to have Trump as a president? Because that's how we have set up our society. If you believe Taxes are theft then that's fine, but a society without taxes wouldn't work.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:02:25
Funny joke my dude.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:05:15
Sure, but you could lessen the gap by not making education part of the financial capital that you gain from your social heritage. One of many "solutions" to the huge gap in the US.

Why the "marry"?
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:51:59
Because you earn more money by selling at 19 and buying at 8, especially since bitcoin isn't going to hit 100k.

Always. You are hires because you provide x amount of value to the company. They are always going to give you less than what you are worth, because how else could they get a profit?
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:48:01


Except the part where your boss pockets 80% of the profit and you gave away 50 dollars of work for 10 dollars pay.

It was just an arbitrary number and most models do work that way.
