Grazie! I finally found some inspiration for a new drawing
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:51:30
I manufacture stitches. Puuurfect &gt;:)
But really, glad you enjoyed it!
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:58:49
Lol I love cheetos. Thanks a million!

Imagine if every upvote was a penny, or 5 cents even. That could really add up! It would cause people to try to say what the masses like to hear, but on the flip side people may be more conscience of their votes. Then again, it's just a penny.

If you could hover your pencil over the paper, a text box would appear with something witty and related.

1 decentralized anti-gravity spider icecream coming right up!
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:55:23
Excellent! One Note, as much as I love it, is a pain. I'll give this a try :)
3000 golden rat turds! private
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:01:43
Haha no arguments there. Even though I was inspired by recent ChangeTip events, I still had to force some of this story line. I honestly could not figure out a good ending, then I remembered the bit-beggars. They follow me everywhere on Twitter! It's so obnoxious.
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:48:04
GIVE THE MAN HIS SPIDER ICECREAM
@_date: 2014-09-06 02:06:58
Hah thank you. The tips are totally unnecessary, but appreciated.
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:49:15
Well it was just something I came up with at the last minute and didn't put a lot of thought into it. In retrospect, I figured it lined up well with how I feel the general public perceives bitcoin: a weird, mysterious, online fad that isn't really worth anything. The rat turd part said by the "authority figure" could be interpreted as anti-bitcoin government sentiment.
Or maybe I'm just immature and think that gold painted rat turds are funny.
2000 golden rat turds for the critique! @_date: 2014-09-05 19:48:58
Sorry, I've never attended an *actual* circle jerk.
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:21:33
Haha I had Charlie Day as my voice
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:23:16
You'd think with the thousands of breweries out there, beer would be cheaper.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:56:15
Whoa! Glad you enjoyed it :) thanks a million
@_date: 2014-11-09 05:42:06
Very cool drawing friend :) $1 @_date: 2014-09-06 00:54:13
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-26 02:18:33
2000 bits
Keep it up!
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:53:48
Thanks! Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:57:24
You're right. It is a little cluttered looking. I was so annoyed with trying to get my drawing program to function properly and eventually gave up
@_date: 2014-09-06 00:54:33
I could use one. Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:41:47
Thanks friend :)
@_date: 2014-09-05 22:22:18
I've always said I would never be one of those "Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!" people.
So here's me not being that guy.

Thank you BaurusdB!
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:22:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:22:18
Where I live, breweries aren't allowed to sell beers for less than $2 or something. "Think of the children!"
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:18:12
Glad you like it :)
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:42:54
Sharpen pencils
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:32:44
Nice! You must be from Circle. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:49:56
Love it! What is that song by the way?
1 liter o' cola
Edit: Changetip is like, "Do we serve 'liter o'cola'?"
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:18:26
Because at this particular bar, you and 4 friends can get completely smashed for $5. Natty is just a means to an end!
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:29:20
Nice flip, thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:15:49
Worship a stronger god?
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:13:22
Danke! Figured I'd rip off the ChangeTip mascot ;)
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:41:21
Thanks Scotty!
@_date: 2014-09-05 20:55:06
Lol, I did consider that. Just the telescope guy and two guys tugging each other
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:40:52
I digitized a pencil drawing with a Surface Pro 3. One Note is actually excellent for drawing these, however I have a lot of difficulty going from One Note to a .jpeg. I know there must be a better way, but I draw on my Surface so rarely that I don't invest time searching for one.
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:54:23
A turd is a tip, no matter how small. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:18:40
Thanks :D
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:24:35
Hah! I think I need a few more PhD's before rubbing elbows with XKCD
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:14:41
Thank you thank you!
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:14:02
Fuck it. Have some cookies instead.
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:04:16
Lol I'll say. I'll pay it forward, be that in online tips, or buying all the boozes at the bar tonight. Thanks ya crazy heathen ;)
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:28:07
"Daddy, tell me the story about how only you and 3000 others held their bitcoin, when everyone else was selling!"
"Okay son, but first let's move to another dumpster, this one is starting to smell."
@_date: 2014-11-15 20:43:43
1000 golden rat turds just for you! @_date: 2014-11-19 19:52:21
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:36:39
Thank you :) 
I posted this earlier, but no one saw, and I don't really understand how reddit works, so here it is again. Anyway, I do it for the giggles.
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:27:48
no complaints here ;)
@_date: 2014-09-18 14:13:37
We have fallen on hard times. Where I'm originally from, happy hour was $2 for draught beer, and there was a bar that had $0.10 Natural Light. Now I live in a big brewing town, and it's hard to find a drink under $3.50.
@_date: 2015-05-06 00:11:20
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:47:20
"Pour your sugar on me" comes to mind. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-11-20 14:50:10
Why have you tipped me like seven times? Thanks though :P
@_date: 2014-11-19 19:17:47
Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-11-19 22:58:10
GRT, the real future! Thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:05:17
If you happen to be in Indiana (and where ever the hell I am) I'll buy you a drink
@_date: 2015-05-06 11:47:34
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-06 11:45:39
Thank you! I plan on doing it sometime after this trip in about a week
@_date: 2015-05-06 00:07:09
Thank you! You just provided my first margarita for the evening ;)
@_date: 2015-05-06 12:06:09
If I had more time I would like to. Hopefully I can make them a little more regularly this summer 
@_date: 2014-09-18 13:30:08
Thanks a'hundred :)
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:47:53
Thanks! I would, but I think it's a little too bitcoiny. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:49:33
I'm in love with your twilight harbor scene. $5 private
@_date: 2015-01-29 04:56:01

You're welcome :) I'm glad people are enjoying it!
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:48:38
Would have digitized this, but I'm on a long road trip in the back of a van. Hope y'all enjoy!
@_date: 2015-05-06 11:49:45
It is not :)

Pro tip: explain your pro tip ;)

shit = BitLicense 
I think the majority of people here agree the this is NYC's fault, and anyone that doesn't want Lawsky's cold finger up their hole digging around for gold is gettingtfo, hence the "fuck that shit" part  
@_date: 2015-08-13 20:43:20
Well that is actually a pretty great tip. Thanks!

Found this thread where some high school kid was experimenting with 3M fluid back in 2012. Funny how all the vets on the thread just keep shooting him down saying that the 3M fluid is essentially pointless because they already have a good system in place. Funny how it reminds me so much of old economists and bitcoin.
