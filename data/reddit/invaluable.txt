If you think about it, you will realise that there is _no way_ you are ever going to profit from could mining. The only reason to buy cloud mining would be if it is impossible for you to buy BTC directly, otherwise (if you _can_ buy BTC directly), just buy BTC directly.

Thank's for putting it so eloquently.
It does make sense for e.g. Amazon to accept BTC as a payment method, and then sell those BTC back to their customers with a profit. If they can do this, I see no reason why they wouldn't.
A forex office will buy different currencies from some customers, and sell them on to some others, with a profit. Sure, Amazon is not a forex office, but the idea would be the same.
Anyone accepting BTC will likely have to sell at least some of it in exchange for their local currency. Why not sell them to some other person entering your store?
Your local legal framework may not be a problem in some other country.

The network stack would ideally be removed, and you could check that in the source code (which most people wouldn't do, of course). But at the end of the day it's a matter of trust anyway, just like you would have to trust e.g. that the entropy is high enough in your Trezor device.

Yes, I meant PoW, but as you say, PoS is not perfect either.
Yes, the ideal would be one person == one vote on the network. The one that figures that out is going to profit...
There are a couple of proposed combined PoW+PoS alternatives, but I believe they all have their pros and cons.
But the current PoW is going to incentivice a monopoly, so something will need to be done. Preferably before governments get involved...
@_date: 2014-09-03 07:10:56
Well, you are correct, kindof. Your are talking about theoretical worst case scenarios with NSA-like adversaries. For the best solution you would surely need a special purpose device. But, with the kind of stuff you are talking about is utterly unrealistic for "regular folks".
Security is about tradeoffs, and a lot of people (like, most people with less than a few BTC; or anyone who today is using a native or web wallet on their regular day-to-day computer) would trade some theoretically reduced security (someone can acces the baseband software and e.g. inject wifi drivers through the bus) for increased convenience (flashing their own Trezor-like wallet onto their smart phone). A solution like that would up their security, even if it is not perfect!
Now, even if I read up on computer security and secure coding regularly, I'm no security researcher and I won't be able to do it securely, but there sure are people out there that could do this securely "enough". By that I mean, they would be able to turn all the relevant things off, or secure them, such that "regular" hackers would not be able to enter my phone and sign a fraudulent transaction.

@_date: 2014-06-16 09:49:44
Um, what? Please elaborate.
If you want to mine, buy a miner. It is way more likely for you to profit from an up-to-date asic than it is for you to profit from could mining. Sure, they get great deals by buying bulk chips and putting them together themselves, and probably have good electricity deals. But, they still have to pay for salaries, rent, coffee machine and so on and want to make a profit to buy new equipment and make the owners happy. This overhead will kill your chances of ROI, which is slim to begin with. Why people buy cloud mining contracts is beyond me.
It's fun to mine. Heck, I still have some cpu miners running... But if you really want to mine, why would you want to buy a cloud contract? You will not ROI, you will not see your miner, you will not do any kind of maintenance (which is fun if you like sysadmin stuff), you will buy into a service that chases monopoly (unless they do p2pool, oc). You will only get back less BTC from the mining than you would have if you bought BTC directly from an exchange.
@_date: 2014-03-05 07:36:58
The calculations are actually very simple. Just take the assumed search space size and divide by the assumed hashrate of the attacker. I will assume that the search space is uniform, but we all know this is not the case!
For instance, with a hashrate of 1Ghash/sec you'd need on average over 13 years to crack a 10 characters long alphanumeric passphrase:
    0.5 * 62 ** 10 / 1000000000 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365 = 13.307004151895297.
This would be the case for e.g. brainwallets, which uses SHA256. But note that the hashrate for those mining brainwallets is probably a _lot_ higher.
But, if you'd use scrypt with CPU and memory-hard settings you'd only cram out a few hashes per second (let's say 10) and the same password would take on average e.g.:
    0.5 * 62 ** 10 / 10 / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365 = 1330700415.1895297
years to crack. This is similar to the security offered by e.g. warpwallet.
So, the parameters you can change to make it more difficult for an attacker is password/-phrase length and hash function.
Use a memory-hard hashfunction and a "long" password/-phrase.
Note, that this is only an example, and in real-life situations I would not recommend anyone to use a password/-phrase that is only 10 characters long. Even if it theoretically would take 13 years to crack your brainwallet for 1 attacker, you would have to fend off hundreds of them, and you must assume that their hashrate is order of magnitude higher than what you think it is for it to be future-safe.
@_date: 2014-09-02 13:00:15
Yes, of course. But that would be very, very difficult with few attach vectors at hand.
Ok, that's good.
Well, security-wise I'm sure it's "easier" for someone to attack an android phone when it's connected to a computer through USB when updating the software, than the same for Trezor. That would be the same vector as for the Trezor device. But that is only a matter of existing software for communicating with andoid phones. If Trezor becomes commonplace, that would change.
I think the Trezor is great, but I doubt it is for the masses. An android equivalence could be.

Have you tried withdrawing smaller amounts, just to see if that works?
@_date: 2014-01-29 07:19:28
It has never been so. Miners decide which transactions to include or not. It will probably be confirmed sooner or later. Otherwise, just send it again.
However, a fee will get your transaction processed faster, and the reference wallet implementation has the following rules for transaction without fees:
 * It is smaller than 10 000 bytes.
 * All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
 * It has high enough priority.
The priority is computed as
    priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_bytes
and the priority must be higher than 57 600 000.
If these rules are not met, the transaction size is rounded up to the nearest 1000 bytes, and a fee of 0.0001 (0.1 mBTC) is required per 1000 bytes. A transaction with size 1001 will thus require a fee of 0.0002 BTC.
Your only luck if you want to "override" a transaction is to quickly (like, really, really quickly. Before the transaction has propagated.) send the same transaction again with a larger fee.

No. You do not need to freak out. What you are describing will not happen because of Bitcoin. If it happens it will be because of wars and economic collapse (for all the other reasons, than Bitcoin), and then Bitcoin would suffer as well.
The dept thing is interesting, though. If you _knew_ that Bitcoin would succeed and continue to rise faster than the ~5% interest of your loan, there would actually not be any reason _not_ to take a loan to buy bitcoins. However, since we do _not_ know, it is _way_ safer to buy and hodl with money you do have, as opposed to money you have borrowed.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:40:41
Of course, big operations can cut corners small ones can not.
But why would anyone invest in a p2pool to begin with? You will not make ROI, or the could mining company will go bankrupt (and thus run out of business), since they could just mine themselves and sell the BTC they find.
If you want to make $$$ you would buy BTC directly, and if you want to secure the network you would not invest in cloud mining.

If the point is to boost p2pool, then you should not use cloud mining, but mine yourself. You are giving money to a company to do the mining for you, if they make a business decision to change _from_ the p2pool back to e.g. ghash, you have no say in it. There is _still_ a central point of failure, and you put your trust in the company being benevolent. Also, often you can not cancel your mining contract until the time runs out. If you want to support p2pool and the network, buy your own miner and point it to a p2pool.
You are missing my point about profitability. If you buy could mining, you are effectively buying BTC for _double_ the price, or, equivalently, buying _half_ the BTC and _giving_ the rest of the money to the company. Its not really about should you get ROI or not, its about what you are doing with your money. Cloud mining is throwing the money away. There's no logical, nor philanthropical reason to cloud mine.
I agree with you on buying a dated miner, if the point is just to mine. Setting it up is not very difficult, and would _really_ support the network (albeit not so much in terms of hashrate), especially if profitability is not the point.

Well, if you send your coins to a new address every time, an attacker would have so crack a completely different problem to reach your coins.  That of reversing the combination of RIPEMP-160 and SHA-256, to find your private key.
There is no need to worry about the crypto stuff.  Either everyone (on the Internet) is safe, or noone is safe.  Noone is going to silently steal your coins by breaking the cryptography of Bitcoin.  If your coins are stolen, it will be by some other means.  If someone do break the cryptograpy, they can attack much bigger fish (e.g. banks and governments), and we would all know in time.
@_date: 2014-06-04 09:14:40

Don't use a brainwallet generator if you want to be secure, especially not an online one, just use gpg to directly compute your sha256 hash of the file.
If you need to do it that way, that is.... Actually, warp wallets are waaay more secure than brainwallets. But, again, you should do it manually on your own computer.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:57:55
It matters entierly. Look, the problem with ghash is that they have managed to concentrate too much hash power to themselves. Now you are promoting another company as an alternative to cex; you are essentially promoting the same thing but now with some other company.
If they outperform cex, they _will be the new cex_. Sure, they say they will mine on p2pool, but at any time they can change this and solo mine and we have the same issue again, but with a different entity.
Then someone like you will come and promote a third cloud miner that we should use to prevent petaminers &gt;50% hashpower.
You are promoting centralised hashing, wich is the problem to begin with! We need to _de_centralise hashing. Currently there is no solution to this problem since people are buying cloud mining, or mining at way too large pools and/or not at p2pool.
In any case this will require a technical solution, since the nature of PoW is a race to centralise hashing.

Disabling in settings is something completely different than what's been discussed, and what I'm envisioning here.
I'd like to know how you propose someone could use the network without the required software to do so (e.g., drivers for wifi and necessary software in kernel). It could of course possibly be installed by malicious software, but that it a completely different problem (about keeping your device physically secure and implementing proper login proceedures).
The andoid solution is better, because most people can get their hands on a cheap android phone, but not everyone can afford or get a hold of a Trezor device. Also, any vulnerabilities in the android case could easily be patched (by flashing a new version of the software). How do you patch the Trezor? (I'm actually asking, because I don't know if you can patch it).
Sure, the android source is huge, but how many eyes have looked at it compared to the Trezor source? And how much of it can be removed if you don't need most of the features?

Maybe someone can fill in the technical details here, but as I get it you would sign something like a "transmutation" transaction (similar to proof-of-burn, but "proof-of-sidechain") that would render your coins unusable as bitcoins, and usable on the sidechain. You can use them on the sidechain, and you can "transmute" them back to bitcoins at any time of your liking, or "transmute" them to another sidechain. Since you own all the private keys, you can "transmute" them between any sidechain at any time, but you can only actually use them on one sidechain at the time.

No, the solution is to mine yourself on a p2pool. Not to centralise the hashrate at some other single-point-of-failure just to avoid ghash.io.
Cloud mining on p2pool is not decentralisation!

Transaction volume is not the same thing as mined coins. Volume is the number of coins moved, while the number of mined coins are constant. Currently 25 BTC every 10 minutes, on average.

No, you are missing the point. You will _NOT_ ever find a block. Your average return will be the same if you pool or solo mine.
Let's say you get 0.1 mBTC every week (optimistic estimate), that's 1.42 * 10^-5 per day. You thus have a probability of 1 in 25 / 1.42 * 10^-5 ~= 1750000 every day. You would thus have to run the miner for more than 1.2 million days to have a 50-50 shot at winning the lottery. That's (1 - (1 / 1750000)) ^ 1213500 &lt; 0.5, your probability of _not_ winning for ~1.2 million consecutive days is 50 %.
Maybe someone want to check the calculations, but the gist of it is there. And I haven't even included the fact that the difficulty is increasing.
You will never, ever, ever, ever, ever win this lottery. For all intents and purposes your probability of winning is zero.

Cool, this corresponds roughly to how I had envisioned it.
Bitcoin will probably not work since in a few months, or at least in a year or so, the payout for CPU (and even GPU) will be miniscule (if it isn't already for CPU). E.g. less than 5430 satoshis in value. It would probably need its own credits (*Coins), but those could possible be exchanged for bitcoins if anyone would facy that.
DRM..? No, forget it. What's the point? Centralised DRM would likely be cracked anyway. If your code and/or data is super secret&lt;tm&gt;, use something else, or build your own cluster. It is not realistic without Homomorphic encryption (still too slow, but moving forward, so perhaps in the future!).
The validation scheme is a difficult part. But the validity of a result could be voted on amongst the peers, i.e. let N peers (at least 2) and the result that got the majority vote (or most votes) would be considered the true one and those would be the ones payed.
Actually, two schemes could be run in parallel here: One as described above, and one where a scoring function is given, and the best result gets all, or some majority of the payout. This would also require the ability to check if the result is feasible. (Imagine an optimisation problem: The minimum result that adher to the constraints receive a payout.)
Exploit: flood the network with workers voting for their own result.
Solution: Some kind of reputation system weighing the results? ThoseSuch systems are problematic, and could be flooded with malicious peers cheering for themselves as well, but maybe.
An excrow of some kind is definitely needed. But I wonder if the network should be responsible for deciding which peers are eligible to claim the reward. This requires some thinking.
@_date: 2013-05-27 13:06:14
This is the way.
Alternatively, without the 0.01 to start with, you bundle small amount of micro transactions (no more than ~10), and send those to a new address (the same address should probably work as well, but its nice to be clean ;-). They will become one single (larger) output for the next transaction that includes another ~10 micro transactions. But in any case, you need to let your micro transactions mature before you pass them on. The older they are the cheaper they are.
Beware: The network will not even process transactions including outputs smaller than about 54 uBTC in the near future (at least not peers using bitcoin-qt). So don't even go near sums that small!

Ooops, sorry it should be:
  D * 2^256 / (0xffff * 2^208) = 4,295,032,833.000015

Yes, the answers are a bit dumbed down, but remember that this is for a very broad audience. Essentially, grandparents should be able to follow and understand everything that's said.
It's interesting in this context, and a bit counterintuitive when thinking about my above comment, to note that all (well, most anyway) Swedish (it is probably the same in many other countries as well) news outlets have a target audience with an education level assumed to be on par with an average 18-year-old.
Add "5 minute interview" + "18yo average target audience" together and your answers are not going to be very precise.
With that in mind, I still think it was a pretty good interview that gave a crash-course in Bitcoin to a very broad Swedish audience.

The reward of the last diff 1 block went to 1DLwTuDBxGX78vXDFdgqmWVsBED3qEbvrE. This address is included in a large transfer (&gt;10,000 BTC) to 1ER9ptGkdWSNeWY3pvbvNhNZS8ie5qEj2K, from which they are moved again and again. This sum has been split several times. Following all these transactions (following the outbranch with the most BTC) I end up at 197FSG6sE4oEst9TZy9vNLe5xUFX1J6oWs that currently holds 500 BTC. These 500 haven't been touched in over a year, though.
It would be simple to create a graph of all addresses receiving a reward for all blocks before  and see how they are moved before and after that. I'm sure you could get a ballpark number of active miners back then that way.

Be nice to the OP. Just because he's naive doesn't mean it's a bad idea!
You are right, if it's just a market for CPU/GPU it could just as well use Paypal of whatever.
The challenge (and the fun stuff!) in this kind ideas is to come up with a viable proof-of-work scheme that has a reasonable tradeof between confidence in the output and speed/redundancy.
I don't think there is any point in using this to mine bitcoins, but if you could trade your altcoins (CompuShares, CureCoins, NooShares, WhateverCoins) for work, and then mine these altcoins using idle cycles, you'd have something that could work. An exchange of computer power. "Let me use your idle cycles when you don't need them and I'll let you use mine when I don't need them."
It would not be a good idea to sell it as another altcoin, since people would just reject it as another scam. This would make sense to scientists or other people in need of distributed computing, that for whatever reason don't want to use EC2 and don't have access to a cluster. Such a solutions would NOT make any sense to newbies trying to get rich quick on the next pump-and-dump altcoin.
I like the idea of NooShare, but I don't think that MCMC is "good enough". However, it is obviously the best idea thus far.
I, for one, would benefit from something like this in my reserach if I could use it with Python, R or Matlab.
Edit: right -&gt; rich.

It's funny that so many people are thinking about this currently. (Yeah, I've also has such ideas!)
However, I think it is too restricted only allowing monte carlo methods. What's the rationale for this decision?
Have you read the NooShare white paper? It proposes an approach that utilises Markov chain monte carlo methods, but I don't think it is general enough either (anyone should be able to easily write programs for such a framework).
It would be fairly easy to allow some restricted subset of python (or lua) for instance. (Think +, -, *, /, built-in types and so on.) But the problem is how to guarantee nobody can escape the sandbox.
If general purpose distributed computing is the aim, and the programs allow any input data, then there is also a problem with distributing the input data efficiently (torrent, perhaps?).
Are you proposing an altcoin or just an overlay for bitcoin? The main problem with an altcoin is how to formulate a reliable proof-of-work scheme. I think the MCMC proposal is reasonable in this respect, but it may still be exploited (NooShare proposes to give a coin to the first one to submit a proof of work and a coin to the best result. I.e. any result would give you the first coin, if you are fast enough to get it into the block chain. Has this ever been discussed? Perhaps I am mistaken?) Perhaps the API should require a scoring function, but then this must be non-exploitable, and also not all problems are scorable like that (e.g. distributed matrix multiplications).
If you are proposing an overlay for bitcoin, I think it would be straight-forward to use BOINC for this.
It would be cool to discuss these ideas further! Is there a forum thread for this, or an IRC channel, perhaps?

I saw it again. He makes two main mistakes:
1) He says that it's anonymous and was made to avoid the NSA and so on. Clearly false, but a common misconception.
2) He says that there's no chance that Bitcoin will do to banks what e-mail did to the postal system because there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, and thus the economy will be too small for that. He must either be making this up and has no clue, or he was just too tired for a morning TV show ;-)

Here's a better answer for you: 
The expected number of hashes we need to calculate to find a block with difficulty D is:
  D * 2^256 / (0xffff * 2^208) = 4,294,967,296
The difficulty is set such that the previous 2016 blocks would have been found at the rate of one every 10 minutes, so we were calculating (D * 2**48 / 0xffff) hashes in 600 seconds. That means the hash rate of the network was:
  4,294,967,296 / 600 = 7,158,278.826667
At difficulty 1, that is just above 7 Mhashes per second.
In 2011 you gou about 4 Mhash/s with a dual core Intel, so if we assume Moore's law is valid here we take half of that and obtain that on average about 3.5 CPU's were used the whole first year.
So the answer to your question would be: Probably between 1 and 4 people, assuming they mined 24/7 (Mining only during office hours would make it between 4 and 15 people, and so on...)
