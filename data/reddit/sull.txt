I've been thinking about how the incentive side of things will play out. 
It's easy to have confidence in the people behind the first real project/company based on sidechains (Hill, Back &amp; Maxwell etc) and they should have some interesting math-based solutions to add on to this system. Beyond that, I can only reach for traditional methods of dealing with the economics and relationships at play. 
sidechain controllers pay to play... block subsidies agreements, overall processing fee disbursements and even legally binding contracts if necessary between sidechains and mining pools for merge mining agreements. Could also have a one-strike-your'e-out rule against mining pools who misbehave. 
All this to say... make damn sure that all the incentives are in favor of merge mining and protecting sidechains rather than attacking and taking advantage of them, if they can even get past the crypto wizardry.

Reminds me of something I wrote last July when I originally wanted to launch what I called "SunCoin" (  ). I planned to peg to Bitcoin (plus other top relevant currencies in mixed algorithm). Now SolarCoin exists (which I admire).
 
I was uneasy about where things were headed, though very excited too (Colored Coins, Meta Layers, Alts etc).
The concepts of "Bitcoin 2.0" circa Spring/Summer 2013 were where my main interest in the Bitcoin space lied. As time went by, none of it felt like the best approach... I chose to do more thinking and waiting. The better way would eventually arrive (Sidechains).

When I sold a house, the mortgage company paid $4000 tax bill that was already paid by the buyer. In order for me to get that money returned to me, it took literally dozens of very long phone calls entangled in the spaghetti customer service channels... All to simply prove the facts. Factom is a way to reduce these types of nightmares to a few simple API calls instead of endless phone calls!

snap out of it. hop off the unicorn. chicken/egg. Bitcoin doesn't need OB.
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:40:44
To your First..... Does OB offer this type of centralized instant settlement protection? I am fully aware that Bitpay etc offer this protection but am I talking about Bitpay? No. If OB equally resolves volatility issues, then I am mistaken. If not, then why bring this up?
To your second... is OB a good darknet? What makes it a good darknet? Does OB want to be a good darknet? If you the user needs to make it a darknet with hacks, then you can use other methods. ZeroNet, DropZone, secure WebRTC channels and so on. Why does an OB store UI matter so much here?
@_date: 2016-01-01 17:45:12
intranet eCommerce. Why didn't I think of that? Oh yeah...

What part of Bitcoin works good over tcp on any hosted website as is do you not understand? 
I am doing a devil's advocate play here. I like decentralization. I really do. I don't have to prop up every variation of a decentralized network though. Some don't make as much sense as others. Poking holes != trolling. Well, maybe it does. But it shouldn't ;-)
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:16:02
that may be true, but OB would be better if the front-end stores were not stuck down in the p2p plumbing and just publish up on the lightweb for the legit commerce that some are trying to emphasize (in comparison to contraband use cases). The name "Open Bazaar" was used to de-emphasize the darknet, yet the design does not cater to anyone beyond the darknet IMO. This project seems to be conflicted, despite any innovations deep under the hood.
  
@_date: 2016-01-08 03:34:43
the storefronts dont need to be p2p. payments and escrow, sure that is a solid use case. the store itself? not so much. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:29:00
my post history? yeah I posted a flurry of replies to this thread within 10 minutes or whatever on my phone. i barely use reddit so I wouldn't call that a history. 
investors with money are not a strong gauge. especially in cryptoland. just because a VC wants to diversify into bitcoin startups doesn't mean they know wtf to expect out of it. in the case of OB, it appears that the funds are going towards shopping cart UI development that just happens to be "unhosted" and pitched as un-censorable. except that, you need to run your store on your computer, keep it running to be discoverable, and pretend that your laptop can't get confiscated by authorities. 
comparatively, you could easily upload a static website in minutes to any host and sell with bitcoin if you want. host takes you down for some reason, upload it again somewhere else. dont even need a database to sell something. hosting is a commodity barely costing users anything these days. can also mirror it endlessly if you so desire. setup ZeroNet and serve the same static webapp there too. send a zip file to someone to download your static store. and so on. I could sell something directly on the blockchain, embedding a listing if I wanted to. 
what is OB solving that cant already be solved a dozen other ways? fine, OB is another option. like i said earlier, I am all for experimenting. But I get the sense that this entails a good amount of new bloat to circle back to offering the same damn thing that already exists... a way to sell and buy shit with bitcoin on the internet. 
 
 
@_date: 2016-01-01 19:31:05
Wages comment... That's me pointing out that one of the best ways to make it easier to use bitcoin for spending is to automatically accrue it via payroll systems, which some companies are working on. That's a pain point that is smart to solve. That aside, it has nothing to do with OB which was my point... to contrast that against how OB's whole point, as one of the fanboys or OB team said, is to make using bitcoin easier.
I'm not certain that OB makes it easier to sell stuff for bitcoin since almost every relevant commerce solution has bitcoin gateway options these days. Some are direct and free, others cost some % on top of miner fees but hey, its easy already.
On volatility, of course OB is not going to solve that either. My pointing that out has to do with why using bitcoin in general is not attractive to mainstream consumers and since OB does not do anything here to resolve it, it again has little to do with making bitcoin easier and better to use in marketplaces. 
If OB is not an improvement on several key areas related to bitcoin adoption, then maybe it can be boiled down for me. I admit the coolness of experimenting (I do that all the time). But tell me in a reasonable sized paragraph what the hell OB is going to excel in compared to the normal solutions everyone is accustomed to (besides darknets)?
 
@_date: 2016-01-01 17:54:43
why is OB needed for this? are you unable to sell your stuff for bitcoin on Craigslist and countless other platforms not to mention directly with buyer? Why make it difficult for a buyer or exclude buyers who are not participating in this OB approach? Whats the point beyond experimentation?
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:45:26
I am not doubting that good ideas are going into the UI and User Networking layers. Hell, with funding, that should be the minimum output of the OB project. Building a product for people who actually want to do everything on an alternate decentralized network and not on the TCP Internet... is called an experiment. And that's fine. Just pitch it that way. Their is no reason to believe that this approach will be favored over the interwebs. If your selling legit stuff, why would you bother placing such barriers to entry to your store? 
@_date: 2016-01-30 05:40:10
You are correct IMO. I think sidechains is technically smart but as far as market value and business plans go... it's heavily reliant on banks and the like first accepting the use of Bitcoin in their everyday business systems... which as you pointed out, is still uncertain and post-hype, probably unlikey too. 
Other than that, I do like what sidechains brings to the broader table. Just not nec something for banks and governments but at no fault of sidechains tech, just overall Bitcoin mining acceptance.
@_date: 2016-01-01 19:43:06
I want to sell pink Darth Vader helmuts. Maybe I can raise some funding. Since it's... you know... different.
Do you know how much money is invested every year in projects that DIE or are NEVER profitable? If so, this claim of raising money is quite moot.
@_date: 2016-01-01 17:38:10


Not sure? You should be at least mostly sure that their is close to zero interest in foreseeable future in a bitcoin-only decentralized marketplace by mainstream businesses. I am all for experimentation but you should lose the marketing/pitch attitude now and just plain talk it. This is an experiment all the way through. 
bitcoin is not a good currency for retail shoppers. it's an OK payment pipe as long as merchants and consumers are spending in non-volatile USD prices. But why would anyone go through hurdles to use a decentralized market and a decentralized (is it really?) currency only to risk making a bad purchase decision because of btc volatility? 
+1 for experimentation here. But stop pretending their is a market for this.

I have not contributed anything to DZ but doubts and punch holes on occasion. You see, I can be a critic of everything. Don't mistake me as a lowly agent for some competing project. I am so far from that, you would learn if you delved. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 17:41:24
So OB is not ideal for mainstream legit transactions nor for "clandestine transactions". What's left? Bitcoin enthusiasts? Watch out for Crypto-Fatigue. I suppose you'll roll out a centralized version in phase 2 just for kicks and giggles.
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:36:17


Is that the whole point? So will OB deposit work wages into its users wallets in BTC? Will it make it easier than Circle or Coinbase to acquire BTC? Will it remove the risk of volatility so I dont accidentally spend $50 for something that was $30 a week earlier? Why can't centralized markets also make bitcoin spending easy? OB seems to make it harder as far as the on-ramp goes. 
If it's the whole point of OB... then i spot some problems here.
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:17:17
And this will be better than the same thing done over tcp by centralized services because...... (your turn).
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:30:28
my typo vs your lack of intelligent response. I win.
@_date: 2016-01-01 18:32:00
I am fine that OB exists and support the experimental nature of it and many other projects. You need someone like me to inject a dose of reality into such a conversation, however. Also..... Diaspora.

Thats the only problem? Wow.

Thoughts on coinspark.org and their integrated notary feature?
@_date: 2016-05-19 01:56:12
Keep the innovation coming!
@_date: 2016-05-12 02:50:29
Yes, that's an interesting aspect to consider. Likewise, think of ways to restrict assets to specific games/apps for situations where a token should not work in another game. 
Also, how to re-purpose a single Asset's tokens in multiple games/apps and maintain inherent value accordingly. In other words, if I spend resources to achieve a special valuable token with powerful attributes in Game 1 that can be acquired for just registering an account in Game 2, and then brought over to Game 1, that's not great. Ways to control this would be ideal besides creating multiple versions of a similarly named Asset (using numerical assets with enhanced metadata etc which is fine if Asset names are not valued in the context of game tokens). 
I was exploring these issues at one point. 
Also, Subassets are forthcoming which is an interesting feature to extend Asset naming capabilities.

Did you notice blockchain.info/tags ?
Maybe in future... store bitcoin address -short handles- in the blockchain. 
I also upvote a look at webfinger for lookups or maybe standardize DNS TXT Record for address storage but need to assess security/hijacking concerns.

interesting topic.
Is their a term to reflect a USD in BTC? 
I was recently thinking of casual bitcoin fractional terminology and thought up the word "bittance" (derived from pittance) to reflect converted values like:
* USD Bittance (USDb) = 0.008340 BTC
* EUR Bittance (EURb) = 0.01084 BTC
* AUD Bittance (AUDb) = 0.008019 BTC

Most are waiting for clarity on legality issues.
bitgivefoundation.org is a new org that is relevant.
 
I'm working on a related project called "Bit of Good".
