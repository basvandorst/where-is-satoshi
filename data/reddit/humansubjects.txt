Bitcoin doesn't NEED to use massive amounts of computing power and the energy resources of a small country to handle the transactions. As miners are added, the difficulty level scales up to meet the supply so that one block is mined every 10 minutes.
After all the blocks are mined 122 years from now, the number of miners will decrease and the difficulty will go down to match it.

Bitcoin doomsday clock? Great idea. People can see bitcoin and watch the number go down.

I got some bitcoin a few years ago at $200. Since then it's been a rollercoaster, interesting to watch at every step. My initial stake is so low that I'm not really worried about losing money when the price drops.
Right now the crypto market is just fascinating. Tons of money being poured in, random coins gaining tons of value for no reason, the Tether Sword of Damocles, watching money move like the tide between BTC ether and altcoins. 
My opinion is that LN is coming and it's going to be a huge deal. I'm not going to get rich, but it's awesome watching the technology and its uses evolve.

He was margin trading. Its basically gambling. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:12:38
This is such bs.


If the market value for mining+fees drops and miners stop mining, the difficulty goes down. Mining bitcoin doesn't need to use nearly as much resources as it currently does.

Sure, send your coin to coinbase and they'll hold on to it for you. You don't have to worry about those pesky private keys, or worrying about actually having control of your money.

Super cheap to open/close LN channels? Sounds good to me.

If you're at the store and ground beef is on sale, do you buy a year's worth of bread? 
If it's 20% more per pound than last week and you want hamburgers for dinner, do you still buy it?
Prices and value aren't static.

The way that money works is terrible and broken.
Every check you send out has all the information someone needs to empty your account. Credit card fraud is massive and unstoppable. Sending money to someone, even in the same country, is difficult and expensive. 
Its unsustainable and will be replaced.

Is it even an interesting data point to look at Bitcoin's circulating supply? It's been around for 9 years, I'd be willing to bet that a lot of the bitcoin mined in the first few years is lost to the sands of time.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:55:45
Miners want bitcoin value to increase. Getting high fees is pointless if the coin is worth less because people aren't using it.

I don't know anything about margin trading, but this sounds like a compulsive gambler at work.
How I Lost Nearly 200 BTC trading this past month
So, long story short, I started trading a year ago, been margin longing the whole run from 1k to 19k ( sometimes closing the top, sometimes closing too early or too late, but always making profit)
I turned 3 lowly btc which I had from playing poker (at the time 3k) into nearly 200 BTC which was almost 4 million at the top and would be 2 million at current prices.
I thought I was a trading genius, a god, whatever. Anyway, this is where the sadness starts.
After the dump from 19k to 11k I went long at the bottom, and kept adding to my position on the bounce to 12k 13k, 14k. Then, at the 16k dead cat, my position was a further 100 BTC in profit. Instead of closing then and having a total 300 BTC, I increased leverage and increased my position size. This entire position was liquadated on the drop back to 12k, because my entry had moved up so much. I lost 100 btc paper profit and nearly 50 BTC margin. I was devasted, and down to 150 BTC total.
After evaluating the situation, I came to the conclusion that the pump to 16k was a dead cat and that we are going lower. Therefore I shorted. At 12k. Added at 13k. Added at 14 and 15k. Got liquidated at the top at 17k. Another 50 BTC loss. Down to 100.
Think, ok we made a higher high at 17k, uptrend back on. Went long. Got liquidated at 13k.
50 BTC left. Devastated, unsure, no clue whats going on. Sat through the drop to 9k, when we bounced I thought it could be the bottom. Longed at 11500, panic closed 10500. When we went to 13k I was kicking myself for panic closing, went long at 12800.
Liquidated this morning for my last bitcoin.
3 BTC to 200, to 0

I mean, it would have been stupid to pour $300,000 into crypto at that point. Only invest what you're willing to lose. You would have made a bunch of money, but at the time it would have been a bad decision.
Crypto is great, but it's good to be conservative with your nest egg.

The lighting network is a complex network of multisig bitcoin transactions. There is no such thing as a lightning coin. It's all bitcoin in bitcoin wallets.

Toss a little bit in every once in a while. Instead of a cup of coffee for $4, buy some coins. Don't waste more than you're willing to lose. Worst that happens is it goes down and you spent some money on an internet game.
