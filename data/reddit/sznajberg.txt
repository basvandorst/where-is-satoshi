Taking 4 seconds to reply does not even make one fuck. Learn some math. ...and BTW whom can you say is truly dumping? The one who says Teslas suck (multiple times) or the one who's saying stfu to the gearhead dumping on teslas?  Don't  bother replying-- that was rhetorical and truly truly idgaf

Well since you know other ΣПƬΉЦƧIΛƧƬƧ well, shit Cleetus! I mean sure if you got 5 ΣПƬΉЦƧIΛƧƬƧ with you maybe 4 even, then I'm sure it's not noise pollution to the rest of the city. Heck, it's like when some ^('very fine person)' is angry and slamming his horn. I mean he don't hear it 'cause his music is blaring in his little box so fuck those old ladies complaining about the noise out on the sidewalk.

Off the top of my head I think of Dr. Jenna Green.... and Daisy Universe (Ozim) they might not be as prevalent but 10,000x more exciting than Rich Heart’s wardrobe.

It's only a scam if I buy one of your Satoshis take it home and it REFUSES to sew up my pants. Total scam if I can't sew, like a pillowcase or a button hole!

OK Aston Martins have more class (but it sucks they don't come with any oil-slick weapons and no telescopic blades from the hubcaps) but Bentleys, I dunno, if you're not Rick Ross.... either way I'm no whale and my bags aren't huge enough that I will ever have this problem... but if I do, and I want to be flashy (cause I still think if you're a whale and you drive a Tesla rather than a lambo or Bentley, you got class), but OK if you want flash, [Genovation &gt; Lambo](

 Ditch the Rupee and buy $RUP 
(to be fair a Rupee is worth $0.015 US and $RUP is worth $0.036968 U.S. and that's my $0.02)

Yeah even the X is a little boxy. To be fair Musk is way conventional with chasis design. The roadster was mostly just a [converted Lotus that he bought,]( tweaked and renammed... but if you wanted classy\-whale EV, [DIY is the way to go, anyway]( (minus the green stripes).

This idea of "Satoshi" and his 1-click BTC destroyer... you should read "Love In the Days of Rage," by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. In the tomb there's an 'anarchist banker" on a train. It's May '68 and they're leaving Paris, and the banker has allegedly filled the train with all France's gold. There's a chance he's going to blow the train up when its way in the alps, said  France will lose all their gold. 
Anyway, no one knows if he succeeded or not, and while he was an anarchist, he was also a banker, bon-vivant... loved his brandy and First-class train berth, and fine clothes, and the hottie he's treating on the train....
My point is, if there is one satoshi, even if there was a mythic 1-click-fuck-you-all-up button, do you think he'd want to go broke? Or want to take down a multi billion dollar system? Think he's a mad anarchist-banker set to destroy us all. 
If you're dipping that heavily into speculative fiction, again, read Ferlinghetti, you can at least add some poetry to the fiction!

They shouldn't put the price in dollars .. Looks like 300,500 Satoshis.

Hey PayPal is great if you want to not be allowed to touch your funds for 3 weeks ...and they only charge you 5% to keep your funds hijacked.  
FWIW if you're in Montreal there's a spot right next to the Eglise Notre Damn that'll buy your BTC or LTC for fiat. There's another on Ste Catherine just east of Guy who buys BTC. I'm sure there are similar shops in both the Big Smoke and Vancouver...  afterwards, I dunno, I spose you can put your $CDN in the bank and then let PayPal get it from your account-- hold it for a few weeks and your golden! 
Alternatively you can just buy stuff on OB

Ok. Username checks out.... but one thing, what if Phamhuangpho is a girl? 
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:48:18
Yeah me too--- I have occasionally sold LTC (refused to hold that once it touched $100) and that place near the Notre Dame is good for that....  just answering Pham up there wrt selling their BTC for PayPal...

@_date: 2019-01-01 13:59:39
Who knows Pahmhuangpho's situation? ...maybe they bought  BTC in 2011 and now they need fiat for some dummy who doesn't take BTC? Some weird landlord who ho thinks PooPal is the best? Or RevenueCanada want their cut and don't accept cryptos yet? What do I know, though? I ain't forflies or nothin'

You gotta point. You might consider buying $450 worth of cannabis and ziplock baggies. Chop the buds into 0.4 gram bags and Sell 280 nickel-bags. That's $1400 ($900 profit!)
