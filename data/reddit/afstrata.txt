Would it be possible to add a "dev fee" to each Bitcoin transaction? This fee would then be automatically routed to a threshold signature address controlled by the top 100 developers of the protocol.
Those developers could then vote on payouts to the group based on the quantity and quality of each members contributions.
Mining fees are millions per day so a 2 or 3% increase would be hardly noticeable to consumers but generate significant funds for developers. I'd estimate tens of millions per year.
Miners get paid directly by the network to secure it. Why shouldn't developers get paid directly by the network to improve and maintain it?

Yea, this was a back-of-the-envelope idea. Thanks for answering.
1) By fees, I meant to say part of the block reward too. Even at 1M per day (at current prices), 3% would be 3k USD/day, which would be just over 1M USD/year. Is that more than the Bitcoin Foundation contributed? I believe so.
2) Maybe it doesn't have to be a program that decides the list. It could be something simple, like the information you previously posted about accepted commits on Git. Perhaps you simply take the top 100 contributors from that list and make them all "key holders" of the threshold sig. Everyone has one vote and you need 51 of 100 to release the funds on a quarterly/semi-annual basis. It'd be pretty obvious to the dev community if a malicious attacked tried to spam the Git repo. Wouldn't it? You could just ignore his entries and move to the next developer in line. 
3) "That sounds painful" ... lol'd ... Democracies are painful sometimes.
4) "Why these people and not some other people" : Because the developers will be able to assess the contributions of other devs more accurately than non-devs. Plus, the devs should set their own budget. Also, with a threshold sig, donations could simply be paid to that address, rather than a single dev, again allowing the dev community to decide the fate of those funds. Heck, it seems a better funding solution than the politically charged, more centralized Bitcoin Foundation.
4) Yea, clearly no way to make developer contributions a machine decidable process (yet). I guess it all comes down to whether such a human-based democratic process would put too much pressure/work/stress/etc on the devs? 
5) Maybe someone can give a "shout out" to Satoshi; ask him to send some of his funds over to the threshold address! :-)
Just dreaming here, thanks again!

Except, it's not quite accurate, technically.
Tether.to, the web wallet, will use Factom to time-stamp and duplicate its wallet database. The wallet is closed source software, running on centralized servers.
Conversely, all tethers in circulation are already blockchain based since they exist via the Omni protocol. The Omni protocol is an open source embedded consensus system, running on a distributed ledger, i.e. the Bitcoin blockchain.
The web-wallet and tether assets are two separate entities, both with their own Proof of Reserves 'balance sheet' if you will.
The scientific problem of cryptographically authenticating centralized, private databases is one of great interest. Think of what it could do for exchange audits. 
Factom is a great step in that direction, but it doesn’t completely solve the problem ... yet!

Can you summarize Chaum's approach technically? How is it cheaper, faster, and more private?
@_date: 2015-03-16 21:25:49
Yes. How many Factoids will be issued?
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:30:30
I'd switch "maintaining" to "cataloging".
It's interesting. Since Factom data will be encrypted, one will have to create a "Dewey decimal system" for finding information (assuming you're a third party who doesn't know what the information includes).

Where is Factom at in terms of development?
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:00:11
This is a great first step in creating truly decentralized audit and accounting systems. These are applications for which the Bitcoin blockchain will be inherently useful.
Any thoughts on next steps? What are the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches? What else is needed?
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:14:38
Cool. I'll take a look. Thanks.

So in a multi-sig, p2sh setup, the private key must first be derived and then split? Therefore, it exists in one place before it's split.
edit: I just read the p2sh section of the Bitcoin dev guide and see that the pub/priv keypairs for t of n are generated first, and then combined to build the p2sh pub address and redeem script.
