now there is a twitter account tweeting these numbers

I am the creator of the site.  I had set up a 0.999 BTC bounty on proving False in Coq.  Upload a correct proof and the server initiates a transaction just after checking the proof.

Thanks. I didn't know about I'm going there.

Though this is not a correct Coq syntax, the last line can be parsed as
    Definition (check_false : False) := inhabitant.
and it defines `check_false` of type `False` to be `inhabitant`.

I see.  Maybe I have to move solved problem in a different section.  Just begin implementing this.
@_date: 2014-01-02 13:21:01
Now seprated open and solved problems.  Is this better?

2chan already has a thread on bitcoins.  For example,

This is what I intend.  Also, the result is open sourced.

How can I send bitcoin automatically when I fav somebody's tweet?

The Theorem part, when filled, will describe a proof of False.  For the proof assistant Coq, False is a type and the proof will be an inhabitant of the type.  Here is why I used the word "inhabitant" 
In the Verifier part, := makes sense because the sentence gives a definition of `check_false`.

This is an escrowing service for proofs.  The proofs in math or proofs about programs.  The server can determine whether a submitted proof is valid or not using the Coq proof checker.  Also, the server can see bitcoin payments.
1. When a problem is posted, the server makes the problem public.
1. When a proof, a bitcoin address and a price is posted, the server checks the proof with Coq.  If the proof is valid, the address and the price is made public.
1. When someone pays the price, the proof is published.

About Coq, I recommend reading this tutorial
