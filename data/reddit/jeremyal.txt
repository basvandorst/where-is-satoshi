I was getting that error as well by typing .01 instead of 0.01. See if that makes a difference. 0.01 instead of .01

I believe you could set up a mining business, and count losses there.
 ie. Mined income in USD less expenditures and depreciation(including section 179). ex. *BTC mined = 1000 USD * Expenses= Business portion of ISP, electricity, etc of 800 USD; *Section 179 a mining rig 2500USD.. *netting a ordinary income -2300 USD. 
However, I think that using mining equipment as basis in a capital loss would be a tough sell to the IRS.
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:42:29
if you mined the coins, you have no USD basis in the BTC, and cannot take a capital loss. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:39:19
This is still up in the air. If the IRS recognizes BTC as a currency, there are different tax rules in place than if they treat it like a commodity. Section 988 is what you want to google search for if you think the IRS will accept it as a currency. Basically, no gain or loss if it is under 200USD. Otherwise, it will be capital gains/loss, or possibly an ordinary loss if you are running a business.

The intention of the post, I think ,(not meaning to speak for anyone) is that the same thing COULD happen to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:37:05
After reading your comment a second time, I thought I might add something of value. I believe that the IRS will treat BTC the same as gold in this case. If you bought a car with 4oz of gold that you paid $3200, and the FMV of gold at the time you buy the car is $4800, then you have a $1600 capital gain to report to the IRS. (in gold's case a "collectibles" capital gain which defaults to 28%). If, lets say, you dug that 4oz up in your back yard, you have no capital basis in the gold, so you would owe capital gains tax on $4800. ...or if perhaps, you were in the business of digging up gold, you could count the $4800 as ordinary income, and deduct the expenses of digging the gold up.... at possibly, a more favorable tax rate.

I am getting the same error when trying to login... look like they are having trouble.

So is cash...

This is pretty much what I do. Had to go to the pharmacy  (CVS)the other day. Bought bitcoin at coinbase. Bought at Gyft. Walked in with only phone in hand. Scanned phone at register. Done. Just trying to do my part to drive the market. :-)

I view a paper wallet as that very thing, but I may be wrong or misunderstanding what you are looking for.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:27:50
I did this Saturday for a little extra money... took about half profits. I am sulking a little over it now, but I do agree that it is the intelligent thing to do.

Happened to me yesterday. Support had it fixed in approx 20 minutes. Had to do with bitpay's system. Maybe suport is low staffed due to holiday.

...or if you trade for a product or service with the bitcoin. Will be treated the same as gold or silver. You will have to realize your gain on the BTC once you no longer own the BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:53:08
I would hope that, perhaps in the courts,preventing acceptance of bitcoins would be overturned, or it would be bad news for bartering altogether.

Pasted from my comment in another part of this thread- it may help here&gt; After reading your comment a second time, I thought I might add something of value.

pretty much. After the 2008 crash, he started kissing the Federal Reserve's ass...hard...
@_date: 2013-11-14 00:47:56
However, there could possibly be a business loss if you were in the "business of mining" and you spent more in equipment, etc than you gained in BTC (converted to USD for the purpose of reporting only).

I believe the intent of the post is to say that the US government has a history of outlawing the possession of things. Of course, that does not mean that there was not a black market for such items, but it is something we could see again.
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:14:09
no, because you have no basis in the new altcoin. edit: This is just my understanding ; I am a tax accountant, but this is all relatively new, so there have not been any IRS rulings on the subject.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:59:22
Me too. I did get some more at $1000 this AM, but wish I was able to get more at this level. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:01:22
yep. technically. Say John give you a chicken, or even a virtual chicken, for a service you provided him. (US)The IRS expects you to include the fair market value of said chicken as income. 
On the other hand, how much money you are receiving would be tougher for them to gauge, but they can and will( in an audit with no verifiable income/deductions) tax you on the income that it would take to upkeep your standard of living less any loans or gifts you verifiably received.

Edit: Sorry not any good at formatting; I am going to try to learn to do it soon.
This is really still up in the air. If the IRS recognizes BTC as a currency, yes, if the gain is over 200USD. Because you have bartered away your asset for something of value, and you no longer own the asset. Your gain (if over 200 USD) will have to be recognized.  This all hinges on BTC being recognized as a currency though. Section 988(e) of the US code.
 (e) Application to individuals
      (1) In general
        The preceding provisions of this section shall not apply to any
      section 988 transaction entered into by an individual which is a
      personal transaction.
      (2) Exclusion for certain personal transactions
        If -
          (A) nonfunctional currency is disposed of by an individual in
        any transaction, and
          (B) such transaction is a personal transaction,
      no gain shall be recognized for purposes of this subtitle by
      reason of changes in exchange rates after such currency was
      acquired by such individual and before such disposition.  The
      preceding sentence shall not apply if the gain which would
      otherwise be recognized on the transaction exceeds $200.
      (3) Personal transactions
        For purposes of this subsection, the term ''personal
      transaction'' means any transaction entered into by an
      individual, except that such term shall not include any
      transaction to the extent that expenses properly allocable to
      such transaction meet the requirements of -
          (A) section 162 (other than traveling expenses described in
        subsection (a)(2) thereof), or
          (B) section 212 (other than that part of section 212 dealing
        with expenses incurred in connection with taxes).
 ....**** If on the other hand, the IRS does not treat it as a currency, it will be treated like gold, and every transaction in which you barter BTC for product or service would have a gain or loss.
