Yeah, I watched your debates 8 years ago and sighed as they tried to disparage our insanely popular system to justify leaving yours unaltered or making it even worse. Tommy Douglas MVP.

There's a small amount of truth to some non-essential stuff having long wait times, but the people who go pay to have it fixed tend to just do that and the people who don't tend to be the ones who would just accept that they could never get it fixed in the American system.
And yes, emergency care is definitely prioritized appropriately and generally great. The edge American hospitals sometimes have is usually actually about advanced, expensive scanners, last I checked.

Actually, they had a pretty solid, well reasoned argument - they have nothing against the currency, but customers eating $20 fees on $20 game sales isn't sustainable, nor is it acceptable to them to have significant currency fluctuation between submission and completion of a transaction, because it causes their customers to lose faith in them unless they eat additional risk by blindly holding.
They're not a research department on the feasibility of Bitcoin transactions. They have no moral obligation to use it - they're an online store experimenting with a payment option, and they have no reason to continue the experiment when it's costing them money.
This response seems profoundly silly to me. Unless you just refuse to buy from any vendor who doesn't actually Bitcoin, all you're doing is telling companies that experimenting with Bitcoin permanently damages their brand.

Every time I read something from Americans that touches their healthcare system, it depresses me.
