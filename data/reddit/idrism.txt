No fees on limit orders (so don't do market orders)
Also no fees on withdrawals. They pay the network transaction fees for you too, incredibly

Coinbase stores ~97% of user funds offline.  And they do it way better than you ever could: 
@_date: 2014-01-30 22:00:31
Another thing.. generally Mint has all of your bank passwords as well, so if they get hacked, you're toast.  If you're comfortable enough to use Mint at all, you should be fine.
That said, I'd still like to see better API control from Coinbase.

Really?  My "Price Paid" and "Mkt Value" on the Investments page still show up as equal :(

"not easy" is not a great barrier for something that needs to be 100% secure. If it's possible at all, then the hologram tape on top is useless and just gives a false sense of security.
@_date: 2014-02-23 15:30:49
Coinbase does not leverage and is one of the most (if not the most) secure place to hold bitcoins: 
Edit: It doesn't hurt that they have $25m+ in funding from reputable investors.

Way to go NPR... Accurate reporting included the following key points:
* A brief layperson's description of how Bitcoin works
* Mt. Gox issues were caused by a bug in Mt. Gox, not a bug in Bitcoin
* Mt. Gox was pretty much the least reliable exchange anyway
* Bitcoin is not dead

Or, if you want to enable the API key, you should go to the "Security" tab and edit your "Two Factor Settings" to require two-factor authentication to send any amount of bitcoins (or at least to send over $100).
+you all should really add multiple API keys, with labels, and enable more fine grained control.  That way we can revoke API rights for specific apps at any time, and we could also say "this app is only allowed to read transaction data, not make transactions"
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:45:55
FYI: "90+%" is not a lot. That means 1 out of 10 transactions could be double-spends (assuming everyone is evil)
Do you know the real percentage? I'd think as a merchant you'd want to be something like 99.999% sure
@_date: 2014-11-09 10:14:25
Don't save keys on an external drive for extra protection. That's not much extra protection, considering it's one copy, probably in your house. If you want to save, I'd recommend keeping them at [Coinbase]( even in a [vault]( If you want to control your keys, you can use their new [Multisig vault](  That's going to be way safer than keeping the keys yourself, even if you have a backup.

What's the point of putting the hologram tape only on one side? Couldn't someone just open the other side and glue it back shut?﻿

I think what he meant is that he made enough money on bitcoin a that he was able to buy a Tesla.

Sounds awesome. Are you still accepting investors?
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:27:32
Kraken.com does not support buying BTC with USD yet.  Everyone in the US is stuck at Tier 1, which means you can only trade virtual currencies (LTC to BTC, etc)

Don't work for Accenture, or Booz, or government or other government contractors.  There's plenty of cool companies and startups in DC.

Another NPR report (text, not audio) on Mt. Gox from this morning:
@_date: 2014-01-01 04:10:47
It's your bitcoin address (the one on the QR code in the pic). This page on blockchain.info shows any transactions made to that address.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:27:17
Also, this 11mBTC transaction ( has a fee of 80BTC.  Is this just people using buggy clients?
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:47:01
Nice idea, you should organize redditors to all give out paper wallets (w/ printed instructions).  It's like people who hand out pennies, but better!
@_date: 2014-09-02 15:58:42
Can someone get this guy to add BTC price as one of his data sources?

Good catch!  According to their [security page](










So yeah, only hot (online) storage is insured.
@_date: 2014-01-15 17:05:22
Can you explain this a bit more?
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:31:11
True for thieves, but if you think about things that could accidentally get thrown away or over-written, a shiny coin is much better than a piece of paper or thumbdrive.
Imagine the following scenario:
You have children, and you die.  Your children are more likely to hold on to (and not throw away) a physical coin they find than one of mommy/daddy's weird papers, or one of those million thumbdrives laying around.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:25:41
FYI it has to be a VISA debit card, credit cards don't count.

The word "Reopens" in this title is misleading.  You will not be able to buy a coin for at least another 4-6 weeks.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:43:17
Use Coinbase's multisig vaults:

PSA: Please store your coins on Coinbase.  It's way more secure than storing them in your house or in your head or anywhere else.
My previous post on this: 
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:05:50
Except that Coinbase is audited by 3rd parties, is a multi billion dollar company, has legitimate investors (NYSE, etc.), and more.
The probability that Coinbase is another Mt. Gox is waaaaay lower than the probability that you lose your coins when storing by yourself. (this applies to 99.999%+ of people, including OP)
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:14:31
Coinbase stores 98% of funds offline, distributed geographically, with access to multiple physical locations simultaneously required to gain access to keys.  The other 2% of funds are insured by a 3rd party insurance company.  So even if they get hacked, your money is safe.
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:28:21
Regardless of these changes, if you're holding anything near 180 BTC in Coinbase, it better be in a Vault!
@_date: 2015-02-24 10:24:16
This. Everyone would be rushing to mine the "original" fork, and it the hashing power would increase rapidly until things are back to normal on that fork.

Not to mention the conclusion of the article is "Seventeen percent of anything is a lot. Enough to keep Bitcoin going, one would think."
Sounds like they think Bitcoin will have no problem surviving.
