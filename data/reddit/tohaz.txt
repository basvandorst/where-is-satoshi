miner can skip working on block if he sees no profitable sum of satoshis for doing so. skip to another coin, or altogether, its possible.
most probable though, as i see it, miners will go bankrupt because there its will become 25x-100x less profitable without fixed block reward.
3rd is, as you mentioned, mass adoption will decline if tx price will be more than 1$ per tx. its around 4k$ per 1mb block, which is low as today miners earn about 100k$ of fixed block reward.
 
4th lighting network has its inertia as opening a channel still requires on-chain tx. i am not an any kind of LN expert though.
ive already seen an analyst that predicts bitcoin eventual decline because of block size conservatism, it will be slow, a most dangerous type of decline

wow, it really takes 5+ years of experience to do such quality TA. truly impressed here
@_date: 2019-10-20 15:19:30
where was this taken from?
@_date: 2019-10-20 17:51:58
this is supposed to represent an analysis? meh

mempool has random access to it, so miner can censor out low fee transactions, leaving some behind even if the block isnt full, true? 
English isnt my native language, sorry. You interpreted my sentense right.

bitcoin became very conservative, by that it can lose its shiny exlusivity medal to competitors. not much is done to block size limit bottleneck for years. lighting network is a spike that does address problem, but only partially.

At least something visits it :)

because greed works both ways. the price of transaction will increase about 100 times, people will seize transactions, the low amount of transactions will push the price of transaction even higher thus end.

it works pretty well. its just an ignorance of some make them aggressive so much so they prefer to break something made by creative and sell scraps  to have profit to make something from ground up. and yes, people are equal, some factors that make them unequal don't make them, less able ones, less worth it. piece of cake.
@_date: 2019-12-19 01:59:24
but volume, oh wait...
@_date: 2019-04-19 16:43:00
If it makes you feel better i bought at 700$ when it topped to 1200 still holding much and used a part
@_date: 2019-04-19 17:19:15
fight at least since 2014

not your pot in the ground, not your fiat. /FTFY :)

Publishing private key? (Move funds to another wallet) (i doubt there is third way) maybe its possible to encrypt the message with public key(which is a wallet itself), so you can decrypt it with private key. It works with pgp that way afaik
@_date: 2019-09-13 09:30:06
not to mention it has to be atomic, otherwise the problem a bit less probable, but still exists
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:58:25
that is rather big sums for 3rd and 4th order. i dont know your wealth, but still. usually i do 50$, 50$, 50$, 100$, 100$, 100$ etc. increasing amounts slowly with the unknown partner...
what was usd amounts of first two orders?
@_date: 2019-09-21 08:13:17
Like in times of Great Depression?
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:44:13
to be what is proclaimed in this vid Bitcoin must increase maximum block size at least x100 + implement a way of decreasing blockchain size such as recalculation of wallet balances, until then i doubt we will see drastical increase in adoption because we hit a bottleneck in block size already
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:50:14
roughly, how many times you used them?
@_date: 2019-09-16 11:12:40
about 15btc, difficulty was growing even faster than now, so shipment time plays against you too. i had access to free electricity tho. and, stressing noisy, i mean, it was not comfortable to stay in the room of about 16m2 with only one working asic, its is about like industrial server at startup, except server tends to limit fans if its idle, ASIC is not supposed to be idle.
@_date: 2019-09-16 10:49:23
i purchased my first ASIC for 17btc, than in that times were 1200$. consider they are noisy, produce some heat, not only consume electricity. now i think it was easier to just keep btc

you can study they are the critics to the point of retardation, then make your weighted decision
