tried both mycelium and copay yesterday without a luck. Breadwallet on android worked fine now tho =)
@_date: 2016-08-09 15:24:42
Finally found a wallet that seem to be able to recover bip32. breadwallet. Syncing right now

Everyone who only had like 0.1 btc or smth shouldnt be refunded. Only those who had enought should be refunded. I'd say a majority of all btc belonged to ppl who had just insignificant amount of btc on their acc's. Its no big deal if ppl loose 0.1 btc lol. Its a big deal for those who lost 10 btc and it is a big deal for bitfinex if they would have to cover invidual insignificant losses.

No bitmain dont have them in stock. They sell d3 for 1450 tho and they are doing 15thash s9:s doing 14thash.
Edit: Not basing you or saying the site i linked is not scam. I do know however its common practice to buyout these machines and resell them. I live in sweden and here idiots try to sell them for over 4k usd locally
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:50:02
Got a lot of transactions incoming to my wallet between 50 usd and 500 usd.
I good idea would perhaps make a habit of scraping everything together and send to a secondary private owned wallet with minimum fee once in a while. Will take days most likely but if im in no hurry at that time..
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:44:51
"I dont know" So I guess I havent? :P Just send from mycelium wallet to kraken exhhange
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:42:25
Pretty sure most of that so called money or debt is fake as fuck. Sure its usable but its probably far from "legit"
@_date: 2015-12-18 15:03:49
Meh, just dont buy their "service". I assume they are going to act as a third part escrow?
Why do "they" always have to be so fucking vague?
@_date: 2015-12-20 12:34:14
Ye all those so called patents are just a bunch of intentionally confusings words. To bad its supereasy to move any type of bitcoincompany to other countries wirhout retarded laws.
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:49:10
Why use this instead of any of the numerous stock exchanges like bitstamp that is much much faster and has no limit and has minimal fees?
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:12:55
Ah thanks =)
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:17:15
Just read about  now. Seems like a good option?
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:37:52
That looks like an online wallet..

Whats up with the link? All I see is some woman being vague as fuck aka vague booking but on twitter.
@_date: 2016-06-16 11:04:44
What a  bunch of fucking retards. You dont have to send in photo of ID and shit to prove its you money. You knowing the password for your account is enough. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:29:18
Why is this affecting bitcoin so much? Bitfinex is just one of amny exchanges`?
@_date: 2016-06-05 16:02:34
I got a 18.38 btc in my bitcoin wallet and a little above 1 btc worth of fiat in my bank. Had plans to split it 66/33 or 50/50 between btc and fiat but fuck that shit now.
btc, properties and land seem to be the best way to secure ones wealth.
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:04:22
Yes i´d like that new 2030 model tesla, how much is it?

I got a whole pre 1:st august bitcoin in cold storage down in my basement in a safe :&gt;
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:51:08
Kraken is the only exchange who havent bullshited me by asking me to explain and prove where I got my bitcoins after having sold to much bitcoin (10k usd worth of bitcoin or so)
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:43:33
Well its kinda retarded that if you want to send a mbtc it would cost like another mbtc?
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:35:49
Bitcoin is terrible for low value transactions because the fee is based on datavolume which is based on how fragmented/how much dust or w/e you wanna call your transaction got which is afaik the case more times than not.
@_date: 2019-04-16 12:56:13
No. Only the transaktion where you sold btc for fiat. There is many different owners of parts of that bitcoin before you
@_date: 2019-04-16 08:35:17
Jokes on them. As if they are the only exchange or seller of bitcoin. Just buy bitcoin on any other real exchange and watch idiots like that go under
Just googled that "company" they sell crypto 6% higher than marketprice.
Just buy on kraken for actual marketvalue instead of these scammers.
Even better use bisq. Its a p2p platform. Dont even need to deal with kys aml bullshit

Plates is what is used to print/mint real coins.  Its a figure of speech. Once the last coin is created the machine who makes them is destroyed so there cant be more coins

Was hoping I It wouldnt have to come to that. Got my old hd wallet seed backuped on 3 different encrypted usbs in different locations. 
Seem like BIP44? is the most compatible wordlist to make a seed from in mycelium?
@_date: 2015-10-04 21:24:12

Rofl what a bunch of retards. Pirated shit isnt shared on cloudservices. Its shared on open and closed trackers and dc hubs.
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:01:51
Its not decentralized? Anyway that seem redundant cause torrents and dc is p2p.
@_date: 2016-07-12 01:46:59
Lol coinbase is trying to forbid people to gamble? the fuck? No one told them to shut the fuck up and get lost yet?
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:53:28
oh i thought i was in r/btc .. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:17:59
You can stop calling them anon. That was a joke derived from a clueless reporter who tought the default unregged username anonymous on forums was an actual user.
