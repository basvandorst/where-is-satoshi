I guess I'm stupid, waste of time tbf only 900% my investment this month
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:06:55
I duno for some reason I'm inclined to believe you had some luck with alts. I made a huge amount from verge and Ada before dumping them both, all within 3 weeks. Can see 50 doing some work if you lucked out 18 is a bit absurd tho
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:09:03
Why would anyone just throw in £10 though, it's just a waste of time at that point
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:58:12
WaBi hasn't moved until yesterday
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:06:14
Already been airdropped 50 like coins, I'll see you at the moon pal
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:30:46
What are you basing that on?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:26:43
Atm I have ada sub xvg and phr. Been a pretty sweet week for me ngl, wbu?
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:04:49
Millions? You said you’ve put 0.007 on it is that a typo?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:20:39
Thanks for the explanation, do you think it’s not viable as a currency then or will it just require adjusting once that becomes a possibility?
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:12:57
You need cash on exchanges to trade
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:49:53
Um yes they are in the UK and most countries
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:46:27
There’s plenty of currencies that have deflated so much that you could say that. Vietnam is a good example, not like you could make more playing wow than working in Vietnam though.
1usd was around 40k dong when I went.

Why do you want a whole one? A week ago ltc was $96 if that’s not blown up then I duno what is
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:37:50
Aren’t student loans usually interest free or at least extremely low interest? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:53:32
If you don’t understand crypto and need it explaining to you then who’s going to listen to you claiming it’s a scam?
People mass sold gbp and it dropped 20% after Brexit, how is that different?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:52:48
Deflation is the exact opposite of being paid to spend the currency.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:27:38
How are fees going to affect a 2k spread lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:11:48
On the other hand some guy sold a pizza for 10k bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:07
Kinda wish I’d slept through that tbh, my alts took a beating
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:33:48
So you're predicting BTC to hit 16 million?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:54:12
He’s not spent any of it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:24:23
Bcash is third largest crypto and had a load of people coins locked up. While I don’t really support them adding it I can’t say I’m surprised. Suggesting it was an inside deal is ridiculous speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:15:10
Wow what, and you’re expected to pay it off?
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:23:43
Futures was predicted to stabilise the price though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:34:54
What about futures?
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:37:42
I was just abbreviating it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:06:03
He literally posted the source and of course it makes sense. Where did he write they only made 30k? They said they made 1 million and expected to ship 30k at the start of the year.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:27:53
Why would btc still be deflationary if it wasn’t tied to the USD? Deflationary against what?
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:36:24
I still can’t believe American parents have to fund university for their children to prevent crippling debt.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:13:16
Banks literally do none of this, also bitcoin has fees for transfers... Unlike banks
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:33:59
This is how currency already works now though? Not like we use cash much anymore. Contactless or even just using a debit card is basically the same as this.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:58:24
Ah yeah that makes sense, cheers.
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:57:15
They were confronted? That's why they ran.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:48:05
I guess, you could just say pounds though
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:39:33
Bizarre you've been downvoted so much. I can't believe people actually think it would be possible to guess a private key.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:47:14
Yeah I wouldn't have considered it needed explaining though haha
@_date: 2018-03-06 08:55:14
Did we read a different post? It's obviously impossible
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:13:42
Hardly anywhere charges a fee for using a credit card
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:14:38
I know that, but my point was you literally pay the same price as you do with a credit card. So what difference does it make? Me using a debit card won't change anything.
I use a credit card to build a credit rating, nothing to do with my being irresponsible with finances.
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:36:55
No, something is impossible if it has no chance of ever happening. It is impossible to ever guess a private key.
I swear Reddit doesn't understand statistics.
@_date: 2018-03-03 09:28:06
This is the cringiest thing I've ever read on this sub and that's saying something
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:54:30
Why not just spell loses correctly so you sound less stupid
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:20:57
Hes making a joke about some guy who made a similar app and included his age in the title
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:39:31
Why do people forget it hit 19k in early December lol
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:58:38
Good luck getting a low interest loan to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:06:16
He's British so no
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:05:44
Yet another? The majority of alts are still rallying hard against BTC, even absolute trash ones
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:11:12
Seriously why is this funny? The poor guy gets pepper sprayed.
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:09:31
Very cheap, also why they don't staple it I assume
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:18:00
Uber is supposed to be banned in London tho not really taken effect
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:03:39
No but someone telling someone else to give their money away to charity is a bit rich. Especially when they were asking how to invest it.
