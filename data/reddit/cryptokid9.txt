Only unencrypted keys can sign transactions. Encrypted keys are basically worthless unless you’re able to decrypt them to sign a message and then encrypt them again. From a security standpoint, it’s best to use cold storage or a hw wallet or at least a sandboxed OS like iOS and not an always internet connected node. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:55:31
LN requires all your funds in a hot wallet, unencrypted. Not a good security strategy for holding. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:37:05
I agree Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core can coexist.  No need for them to bash us with this stupid Bcore or SegwitCoin nonsense and no need for us to call them Bcash.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:04:18
You either need to open up a prefunded channel kind of like a gift card or you need to route your payment through a hub. Presumably the store, apple in this case, would have a channel with a big efficient hub you’re also connected to that you could use as a middle man for a hopefully small fee. That way you could keep transactions off chain and avoid tying up lots of BTC by having lots of channels with one off small businesses. Pretty cool right?!
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:34:45
It'd really be something if BTC were to recover from 36% back to the &gt;90% dominance it historically had been before this year.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:44:36
All your Lightning funds 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:10:45
LN allows you to use a network on top of Bitcoin instead of the Bitcoin network.  If you want to buy coffee for example, you can deposit several hundred dollars into a payment channel with Starbucks and then spend down from that balance.  Alternatively, you can deposit a large amount of Bitcoin into a channel with a payment hub and then you can use the payment hub as a middleman to send your transaction to anybody that hub is connected to for a hopefully small fee.  This way, you just lock your bitcoin up in payment channels with hubs and hopefully you don't have to use the bitcoin network at all!
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:09:25
Unfortunately it’s false because you can’t avoid fees no matter how long you wait. Fees are lower now but it’s been a long time since no fee transactions have been confirmed. Heck, the default on Bitcoin Core now is to not even relay those transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:47:44
LN is off chain. All Bitcoin that has ever existed will, of course, always be on-chain. What isn’t on chain when potentially using LN in the future is the ownership of those bitcoin. I’m not sure what you’re trying to accomplish by implying LN is on chain but it’s very misleading.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:55:49
Unfortunately true LN usage requires hot wallets
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:52:01
The keys need to be unencrypted so the punishment transactions can be signed if needed. I suppose you could keep your keys offline, but then you’re back to a trusted model and you can’t go on vacation. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:18:07
Im pretty sure the answer is zero. I don’t think it was an LN dev who made this post declaring it as “here”. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:25:28
Well anybody who is able to access your machine. So being able to run a secure system that’s always on and connected to many Untrusted peers is a big part of LN. because if somebody can access your machine then they can steal your bitcoin since you’ll have to have your unencrypted keys there. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:22:29
BitPay is great, but unfortunately the customer still has to pay a hefty bitcoin network fee at the moment averaging about $25 a transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:58:46
But LN is planned to be integrated into Bitcoin Core but isn’t exclusive to Bitcoin Core. Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin...any coin can implement it. If it comes out and it proves to be beneficial for a variety of use cases the benefit won’t be BTC specific. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:08:12
There’s a lot of people who would argue that mining is an integral part of a “full” node and that a node is good but not full if it’s not mining. Andreas calls non mining full nodes Network nodes to distinguish them from full mining nodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:32:13
You’re completely missing the innovation behind Bitcoin and sounding like a Bitcoin Cash guy. The innovation behind bitcoin is that we have united around it as a store of value. That’s the utility. Storing value on a hard to change system. If money was changing hands all the time that takes away from things. Alts can be used for spending. bitcoin is for hodling
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:15:21
So if we don’t like a change the core devs are doing we just reject it and have our own chain. Is that how bitcoin cash and bitcoin core separated?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:43:08
That’s a configurable parameter. You will never see all the other people locked out of transacting because you’ve configured your client to purge any transactions beyond your 300 MB limit
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:40:20
Hopefully an honest company like Blockchain.info will step up and provide a service like that for free. I bet it will be free actually because then that company would have full visibility into your txs that they could monetize like the big CC’s and banks do today. And so long as you’re not doing anything illegal you could probably trust them. Not ideal though since that would be centralized and trusted even if it’d be cheaper and easier then running your own always on Bitcoin+LN node. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:43:14
Just remember, the Lightning network will help close the gap between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. We have the stronger developers and it will show when we get the Lightning Network online hopefully next year. By this time next year all those high fee Bitcoin Core transactions will be replaced by instant and cheap lightning transactions!
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:56:18

You’ll find more than one podcast where he says he doesn’t like mt gox but believed they were solvent and it was a lot of FUD. I gave you a narrow range to search. Best of luck.

You’re right, one and two are very different numbers. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:24:35
Well, rather than a malleability fix I think his point is that LN code itself could be improved such that it could work on a system like original
bitcoin where txids could be malleated. My understanding is that yes, this can be done, but it would complicate the LN code further. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:10:23
That kind of talk ain’t allowed in these parts partner. In this sub Bitcoin Core &gt;&gt; Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:50:43
You mean like a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:28:21
True. It’s been 18 months for at least 3 months already. And in 2016 it was “by the end of this year”
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:08:39
I’d use a standard bitcoin transaction for cold storage. More likely it will be supported going forward. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:42:16
On BTC, you weren't going to do a BitPay transaction anyway
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:47:52
Bitcoin fees are generally higher than they have been right now. I think the average transaction fee for the last few blocks has been about $70. And your tx has a ton of outputs so you have to pay extra for that. You should batch your txs and move only bigger amounts. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:15:32
Not gonna do the dirty work. I told you where you can find it. Sift through the podcasts yourself bro.

@_date: 2017-12-28 13:52:55
Go back to r/btc shill! Digital cash was never the innovation. Use Venmo. The innovation was a community uniting to hodl it! That’s what driven the price up and made it such a world changing investment. If we keep getting new investors the price will keep going up. Lambo time for me!
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:01:05
No!! No hard forks. Bitcoin is bitcoin. UASF! We know what bigger blocks do. Look at Bcashtrashscamcoin. It’s worth less than us. The market has spoken. We have a plan and they’ve voted for it. Go back to your sub!
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:05:23
But things need to change ASAP. You’re saying we’ll have lightning network in 18 months, but you don’t think things will change? So we’re stuck with the current situation on Bitcoin Core for another few years?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:35:53
BCH has very open blocks so his tx should go through instantly. I don’t know what the other exchanges confirmation policies are though.  I thought Gdax has BTC/BCH trading pairs. If not, with fees they say they are. Sounds like his assets are frozen then. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:39:37
But we’ll us Lightning instead of Bitcoin? Does Lightning need Bitcoin or can it run on top of other things like LTC or Tethers or something like that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:14
It’s a mess out there but if you got in in August just HODL and you’ll be alright!
The list to my knowledge 
Bitcoin Cash: Hard fork to enable replay Protection with the original chain ahead of segwit activation and increase block size
Bitcoin Core: Soft fork to enable Segwit
Bitcoin Segwit2x: DOA, hard fork to increase block capacity
Bitcoin Gold: Hard fork to premine and decentralize mining
Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Unlimited, all a little unclear with low trading volume.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:14:02
LN can’t run on your phone. For trustlessness, It needs to run on an always on Lightning Network Node. You could use a phone and pay a trusted Lightning Network Service Provider though. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:33:15
Has to be a full non-mining node. Can’t be a cell phone. Has to be a server.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:35:02
About August 17, 2015.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:56
Yea that's true.  My only concern with that approach though is that if I'm not home what happens if my power goes out or my cat pulls out the power cord? Running an always on server is hard and I think I'd prefer to pay a large company I trust to do it on my behalf, like AWS.  Probably less likely I get defrauded since I trust them more than I trust that my power will stay on or my internet won't go out while I'm on vacation.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:36:45
Nope. It increases node requirements exactly as much as it increases transaction capacity. That’s why you hear a lot of core devs saying we shouldn’t be using Segwit until LN is ready and we can all switch to using the Lightning Network instead of the Bitcoin Network. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:27:37
We just had this debate though.  We need to be pursuing efficiency gains like Schnorr signatures and batching.  Not throwing more money and computers at the problem and hoping it goes away.  Our side has the engineers.  Let's use them!
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:22:28
For a standard tx, it would reduce your fees by about 40%. So if it was going to be $20 it would be $12. A decent savings. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:55:04
So I’d be using Lightning version Bitcoins? Would those get mixed with my Lightning litecoins? Or would those be separate?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:34:00
It’s a trusted third party system if you don’t run your own node. You need an always on server monitoring the network for fraudulent transactions. The LN system doesn’t work with phones without a trusted third party
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:55:55
BTC has outgrown use as a currency or a means of exchange  it’s now digital gold and meant for hodling. If you want to actually use it you’re doing it wrong. Use something else. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:46:00
Nope. The vision is that once Lightning is up and running most people will be using that instead of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:20:15
Well the Bitcoin Core devs will come up with some other way to make it happen. I just know they will. those guys are geniuses! Probably invent some new kind of crypto. The high fees have only been happening for a couple months, they’ve barely even had a chance to work on it yet. Stick with Bitcoin Core!
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:02:45
But if the block size grows I won’t be able to run it on my raspberry pi and it will hurt decentralization. This isn’t the bankers or miners coin.  You want to grow it unbounded!? This discussion was had and the community answered. Go back to r_/ b t c Roger! No2x, No3x, NoXx!
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:59:51
Bitcoin Cash is actually doing pretty well all things considered, in terms of adoption and market cap. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:15:26
True. Since the fed, nothing but inflation. But I’m posting in a bitcoin forum so obviously I’m not pro dolllar! But if I put in a dollar I can be reasonably certain ill have about 95 cents of purchasing power a year from now. With Bitcoin at its current adoption levels the illiquidity leads to volatility and that $1 could be 50 cents or $1.50 a year from now. Hard to rely on the value stored in BTC at this stage and it should really still be considered more of a speculative bet. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:43:29
Lightning has been somewhat slow to strike. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:42:00
Currently average fees are about $25. Assuming fees don’t get any higher in the next 18 months, If he tried to convert it to bitcoin on the bitcoin network he’d only get to keep $5 and . Better to keep it on the LN if that’s where you get it. Doesn’t make sense to make it into on-chain confirmed bitcoin unless the value is about 100 times greater than twice the average tx fee (I.e. fees eat away less than 1%)
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:57:21
What the fuck are the devs doing them?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:21:35
You need to run a full node if you want to use the lightning network as trustlessly as the bitcoin network.  Otherwise you can be defrauded.  If you don't run a full node, you'll have to pay a third party to monitor your financial transactions on the Bitcoin Network to make sure you're not being cheated.

Yikes. So many bitcoin chains!
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:42:22
That’s true. But we should be tapping more women all the same. Whether they are developers or not we should be tapping them. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:35:46
Isn’t the commit access to the most important part though? Since they control what does or doesn’t get built into the Bitcoin Core currency? They’re the gatekeepers. We should get him in that gatekeeper role if he’s the number 3 contributor. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:16:50

As a trader based on your username you must know though that things don’t keep going up that fast forever though. I could tolerate it being a poor store of value (volatility) if I could be sure it was going to go up. But then I’m making a speculative gamble, not storing value. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:07:48
Dude, im messing with you. I support the white paper and always have. Bitcoin: peer-to-peer electronic cash. Value without utility is absurd. But good luck convincing the Bitcoin Core fans of that. I say let them be and we’ll continue driving adoption of real Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:55:03
You’re concern trolling. I sent a tx just a couple weeks ago with a $1-2 fee and it confirmed in only a couple days. Just time your txs and don’t use it during peak hours and it’s cheap! Protecting your net worth in a decentralized way for $1-2 is a bargain. Don’t spam the network with low value txs. Go back to your community and quit attacking ours. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:42:21
If your channel or a node in the route your planning on using goes dark you don’t lose money but you’ll have your money tied up for quite a while where it can’t be used elsewhere. You’ll have to wait for a timelock to expire. And what you touched on about backups of States is big I think. We talk about fraud as if it’s deliberate but the bigger thing in my eyes would be people accidentally trying to settle old states on chain because of a bad backup or just carelessness. 
And as for losing money if my power goes out, if my node goes down and my counterparts knows it and knows I’m away he can publish a bad transaction state knowing I won’t catch it in time, stealing my funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:01:03

Oh cool! So I can just keep using my bitcoin wallet to send and receive Lightning! That’s awesome. I thought it was going to be more complicated than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:43:10
I thought it was generally agreed that Bitcoin is really poorly suited for use as an in-person currrency at places like this due to fees and confirmation times.  At least until Lightning Network comes and we can pay through Lightning Hubs. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:49:28
*Forwards compatible. Every upgrade has to be backwards compatible to sync back to the Genesis block.  Segwit is forward compatible to convince existing software that the segwit transactions it doesn’t understand are still valid while intentionally still allowing people to choose not to use Segwit if they don’t trust it or for whatever reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:35:14
Umm. Segwit is a backdoor blocksize increase, not an efficiency improvement. Segwit is larger blocks.

I bought in to bitcoin two weeks ago and immediately made an account so I could be a part of the conversation here and learn about BTC, so forgive me for not having gotten in in 2010 like you.

@_date: 2017-12-26 14:23:57
 I already paid the early adopters to get in through my purchase of BTC. If they think think they’re owed something more they need to re-evaluate.

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:08:08
The concept of hard and soft forks is new. bitcoin has undergone many forks in the past and hard forking was considered best practice as it allowed all miners and users an opportunity to decide for themselves. We’re already in forkception land!

@_date: 2017-12-28 01:40:58
Good point. We should discourage people from transmitting bitcoin on chain. It drives up fees and devalues it. Bitcoin is digital gold. It’s for holding.  Not for actually using it for stuff.

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:21:43
We had a soft fork for segwit so we made it so old clients couldn’t see the change, we made it non-mandatory, but the people opposed to it still opted out and made Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:16:19
No I think that’s pretty good. But in the future most of our transactions will be with super fast and scalable Lightning coins backed by Litecoin and Bitcoin! I’m ready to switch to Lightning as soon as it’s released!
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:31:05
That’s a rather depressing way to look at it. You’re saying usage percentage is declining because the rate stays the same while the base is increasing?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:29:45
True but with current Bitcoin Core difficulty levels it would take you millennia to reach the difficulty retarder point. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:18:38
Yea I’m pretty well read up on the network. Just gotta run a full node to monitor the network for fraud and with the tx capacity kept at 3 tx/s that can be done on a raspberry pi. So I can do that or I can pay a LN service provider to do it for me if I’m afraid of an SD card failure or power outage or something.

Good idea! Companies like blockstream are potentially going to face some serious aml-kyc restrictions in a year or two when hopefully LN goes live.  You should contact them to see what you can do to help their business stay on the right side of the law!

We don’t need lightning. We need holders. If something wants to take the role of cash let them. They won’t scale. We’re gold!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:48:24
Good question. It seems like they have three options
1.  Call BCH BCash and BTC Bitcoin
2.  Call BCH Bitcoin Cash and BTC Bitcoin
3.  Call BCH Bitcoin Cash and BTC Bitcoin Core
I wonder what they'll do.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:25:48
So Lightning is more than bitcoin right? It’s also litecoin etc. ? That’s why I think it’s better to talk about my Lightning Coins on the Lightning Network. Consistent to distinguish it from my Bitcoin on the Bitcoin Core network
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:02:23
Wait so what if half the people want a change and half don’t?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:39:39
Oh no, not a Wikipedia link about logical fallacies! Devastating blow. I’m not digging through the podcasts because I don’t want to listen to hours more of that tool. If you care that much. You do it. If you don’t, just know he and Ver were both chumps
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:52:50
So the Lightning Network will replace the Bitcoin network? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:09:53
Since each fork of Bitcoin Core could be an altcoin that just reaffirms we should all be running Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin. The Core Devs are some of the smartest people out there and they’ve developed a great peer review consensus system. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:52:22
Remember when some companies tried to run nodes on non Bitcoin Core software and the companies were blacklisted and discussion of the clients was barred as they were actually just alt coins? There’s a reason we all use the one client. It’s the only one guaranteed to be consistent. 
Trust the core devs. They know what they’re doing. Bitcoin Core was worked on by Satoshi himself and is the true Bitcoin, not XT and not classic. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:26:43
ETH fees are high too. Maybe try Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:58:31
Take-over by who and from whom? BTC is decentralized right? If there’s nobody to take it over from so It must have been a rejection of the code. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:45:15
To me store of value means if you put $1 in you can rely on it having $1 of spending power later. BTC has huge price volatility. It’s been up overall from a backwards looking perspective but I’d still say that makes it a weak store of value since the value being stored changes minute by minute. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:47:10
Well we started being promised 18 months a few months ago so we should be all set and ready to go for a Lightning future in about 15 months! Exciting times!
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:05:52
So are all the Bitcoin Cash clients. Are you arguing that they’re as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:59:42
Second this post! But u/Hyrolluhz I will say there are other subs where Bitcoin technology and news is discussed beyond the price.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:32:59
Wasn't being patronizing. Just assuming based on your username that you had some experience trading and wouldn't assume that it would go up at this rate forever.  Wasn't trying to attack you, didn't mean to trigger your defense.  If anything I was assuming a base level of knowledge beyond that of the average redditor. 
Over the last 10 years for gold, I see a low of about 700 and a high of about  1800.  That's some volatility to be sure if you assume the value of a dollar has been constant over that time period (which it hasn't), but over that same time period BTC has gone from 0 to 20k.  It's not fair to compare a currency in the process of bootstrapping to gold, but that essentially emphasizes my point that it's still speculative and not a reliable store of value yet.  The tech is strong and revolutionary and I think the speculation is not uniformly ill-advised, but it's not a great store of value since the value itself changes a lot "minute-to-minute" and year-to-year (although thankfully for us that has been mostly up).
I'm glad your forex trading seems to be working out.  It sounds like you're quite the expert.  These wild/exciting crypto markets must be a big opportunity! Hope you keep crushing it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:09:03
Looks like it declined in mid October and is now stagnant at about 10%
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:50:44
The full tx fee unfortunately. So at the moment on average about $45 but if you can wait a few days maybe you can beat that 
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:17:39
Why aren’t you running bitcoin core? This is why we need to reduce the block size...
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:21:33
You could try converting it to BCH and sending it and then converting back on the other exchange. That should work. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:14:56
But Bitcoin Core is just an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol right? They don’t have veto power or administrative control of Bitcoin,,l right? Why wouldn’t they be able to keep contributing after the fork? Because if the core developers have that much control isn’t it a problem?
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:04:33
You guys think you own Satoshi. Satoshi didn’t want us to stop with the white paper! Bitcoin Core is the real bitcoin no matter how much you want to take the title from us. Bitcoin Core is the real chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:49:59
But don’t our nodes have to work together? Ok though I think I get it. So if I don’t like an upgrade by the Core developers I don’t need to upgrade and my client will be able to see the upgrade by other nodes and reject it? That way I don’t need to upgrade and then if I don’t like something new the core devs are doing my client will reject it?
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:00:08
They’re probably trying to differentiate it from Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:42:10
The list to my knowledge 
Bitcoin Cash: Hard fork to enable replay Protection with the original chain ahead of segwit activation and increase block size
Bitcoin Core: Soft fork to enable Segwit
Bitcoin Segwit2x: DOA, hard fork to increase block capacity
Bitcoin Gold: Hard fork to premine and decentralize mining
Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Unlimited, all a little unclear with low trading volume. It’s a mess out there but if you got in in August just HODL and you’ll be alright
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:35:48
Whatever Shill. Keep pumping your altcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:59:10
Seems like we just see a lot of things a little bit differently, from the definition of store of value to how to effectively persuade people to a line of thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:07:23
It’s the consensus vision of the community. We’re not letting your narrative hijack our digital gold! HODL!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:11:20
The market has spoken and price is what matters. BTC value has tripled since we beat off the 2x attack. Quit spreading FUD with your concern trolling. What we need to be doing now is HODLING and planning for an all BTC future. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:39:21
I’m saying Bitcoin is decentralized and we as a community rejected 2x and you have to deal with that. Nows the time to ignore the FUD and HODL! Go back to BCash you shill!  
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:44:41
But by whose definition of merit? I thought anybody could commit code and that’s why it was decentralized. I didn’t know only a few people could. Isn’t that a concern? Could I make my own Bitcoin Core client to help out?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:15:29
Oh are you one of those bcash people? Bcash is not and will never be Bitcoin! Bitcoin Core is bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:08:24
I don’t need to prove anything to you. I’m a bitcoin merchant and a bitcoin expert! My customers use BTC all the time with no problem. I accepted 15 payments in BTC last week alone. The network is working as intended. We don’t need to record every coffee on the Blockchain forever. We have bitcoin as our savings account and Lightning as our checking account. I’m already using Lightning myself and it’s incredible. More people should be using it. The code has been released. Go back to r/btc if you can’t wait for your fricking coffee. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:35:26
Here’s to hoping lightning network gets deployed before it’s game over. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:58:55
That’s a good question. We’ve changed it a lot in ways we think are good. Bitcoin Cash is a lot more like the original, but we’ve got some smart devs who can make our bitcoin better than the original Bitcoin Satoshi invented. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:06:14
But with two competing sha256 bitcoin coins a slow bleed seems unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:21:38
BTC's entire value prop is that it is cen5or5ship (sorry trying to avoid the auto-m0d removing this comment) resistant money that anybody can use.  Don't need roger's approval to use my BTC!  If you increase the block size, you're trying to undermine that and you're attacking BTC. The Core devs are a talented, smart, hard working group. We should trust them and you should too.  I support Luke-Jr's BIP.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:29:17
Well the BCash people think because they removed double spending through replace by fee that that will be good enough for coffee. But the confidence you’ll have with that won’t be as high as you would have if you were running your own always on lightning node on your own server constantly monitoring the bitcoin/litecoin/etc. Networks for fraud. Can’t beat that!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:04:30
Wel that’s definitely true. We should be using HD wallets where your phone uses a child branch. Ideally down the line though people aren’t holding so much crypto on a routine basis so the theft/kidnapping motive declines. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:27:34
Unfortunately it has to constantly listen to every transaction on the Bitcoin Network to see if there’s a match with a list of offending txid’s. Has to be a full node (non-mining though). You can pay a trusted server to do this for you, which i think is reasonable, but unless you’re running a full server yourself and are never offline it’s not totally trustless. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:51:59
Bitcoin is a store of value, not a means of exchange. If you want a form of payment go back to r/btc and Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:18:20
Exponential growth for life!

Didn’t Andreas claim mt gox was solvent and a good place to send bitcoin for a quick profit as well?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:39:27
Ha keep trolling. You and your kind got your version of Bitcoin in August and we got ours. Bitcoin is digital P2P gold, not P2P cash. Tx fees don’t matter and the market knows that. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:56:05
Bitcoin Core is the original! You guys forked off now go on back to your sub. Bitcoin Core IS BITCOIN. Bitcoin Cash isn’t and it never will be. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:19:31
But very recent history shows us that a soft fork can create two possible coins as well. Making the change opt-out instead of opt-in still fucked us.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:16:36
Fees are hard to predict, but the reasoning stands. Yea I agree though that when it’s ready new people should be shown the lightning network and lightning wallets where they store their lightning tokens (BTC, LTC, ETH, etc.) instead of the bitcoin network, bitcoin wallets, and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:58:03
12 words gives you as much entropy as needed, beyond that level of entropy it's easier to attack the underlying crypto itself.  Don't know why people use 24 words at all.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:07:30
if you hold btc and made money on btc maybe you should just go to r_/_btc and leave us alone!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:09:53
Bitcoin is popular though because it’s so good! And I saw on the bitcoin site that it has low processing fees so I think I should be good. I’ll send the full $40 at once though to make sure. Won’t send it $1 at a time like some newbie!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:15:01
That’s a hot word that tips off bots. Best to change it
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:43:38
Well it’s a more top down approach. It’s an opt out fork vs opt in (soft vs hard) and can lead to significant technical debt. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:04:15
? Are you arguing they do owe me something?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:11:27
Yea we need a higher tx capacity in bitcoin and to remove replace by fee so transactions can be trusted with some confidence instantly!
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:01:38
Yes! This is why I think Bitcoin Core will always be more valuable than Bitcoin Cash.
