Very dumb question but when I go to bitaddress.org and the very first window is "Single Wallet" is that where you're pulling your "Public Address"? Or are you pulling them from the BIP encrypted ones you generated in the tab over?
Also, what is your BIP0038 encrypted private key? Is that the key that's at the very beginning of the page when you go to bitaddress.org?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:51:01
This is a really dumb question but after you send those bitcoins to the address on the Armory, how do you gain access to them? With the private keys where do you go from there?

How is someone able to do this? The sender is the same one that would send me login verifications.

I'll just refresh the page once or twice a day instead of having some anonymous person/group have my personal contact information. Ever since MtGox went under I've never seen so many people try to grab at user's persona information whether it be for news updates or to join part of a civil law suit. 
Just a reminder to be safe everyone with giving out your personal information.

This was infinitely more helpful than the reading the steps above. Thank you for this.

Where do you delete the private key after you've entered it?

I seriously doubt that will happen now, however I don't know how he would be able to get away with it since so many people have a lot of money tied up there. I'm sure there are a few whales that aren't going to let him just walk away so easily.
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:55:32
So when you import the private key click "directly" and that will throw all the funds into your wallet, which you can then spend however much you want. I'm a little confused at how you delete the key. What key are you deleting and where is it located? You used the private key to import, you're not deleting the private key are you?
Sorry for all the dumb questions.
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:03:46
What would you suggest as being the best way to put them into cold storage. I'm one of the people that has bitcoins on Gox ready to move out but this debacle has proven to me not to leave BTC/Money on exchanges. I want to move everything to a wallet, what would be the best way?

Where do you get the private key after you've swept it?
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:33:18
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:38:26
So I guess it wouldn't matter if you imported directly or swept the key then? So you import all your BTC from paper wallet, spend what you need, then create a new BIP38 encrypted paper wallet and send it to its respective public key and then after that's done you archive then delete the previous keys from Blockchain.info?
@_date: 2014-03-04 05:27:03
Oh wow, good to know. That's very handy. 
@_date: 2014-03-02 04:07:35
When I went back to blockchain to import my wallet with the BIP0038 encrypted private key it said "incorrect password" which doesn't make sense. However, opening the wallet.aes.json and copying and pasting the info into the window worked. I'm confused as to aster you paste the BIP0038 encrypted private key, where do you input your password? And is that the password to your blockchain account or the passphrase from bitaddress?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:33:24
Is that it? Is this your "breaking" story?
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:26:03
Oh ok. That makes sense. I mean I have the private key from that was generated from Bitaddress. If I don't lose that then I'll never lose the BTC that are sent to that public address that's associated with the private key. Can you send BTC to private keys or is it always public keys, which is associated with the private key?
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:09:24
When you archive and go to delete, do you delete just the private key or do you delete the address and private key? It's a little scary that it says it's deleting and it shows a BTC amount? I mean I'm doing this with 0BTC just as a test but I'm assuming if I had money on that private key it would show the amount correct while it's deleting? It wouldn't be actually deleting the BTC out of the private key would it?

I don't have any bitcoins at the moment because I was expecting a crash, and look where we are. The last crash when from ~105 to 50 in less than 3 hours.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:27:09
I think it was based on the fact that if you didn't have any fees (10*128 and then sold at 138) you would think to receive $100 but in reality you received $83.5. I'm still trying to wrap my head around why you can't take into account the relationship between expected profit without fees and actual profit with fees.

Can you say when to cash out your coins or does it do it automatically. Like say for example you deposit money but the price is dropping like a rock, can you hold onto your cash and buy out when the price stabilizes a little bit?

How do you do that? I can't see it anywhere on their page when I'm logged in.

Ok here's the deal. I did dwolla, verified my bank, then transferred funds. The funds were put in then I tried to use bitinstant through dwolla to go to Mtgox. However, they asked me a lot of questions to verify the account and in the end I ended up having to send them my ID. I've never heard of this before but it also said nothing about a 30-day waiting period.
I'm really confused.

Update your website with this statement would be more effective than a non-credible reddit account. 


I can't believe you're making light of this situation. 100's of thousands of dollars are being held by a single man who has neglected his user base since it went under, meanwhile updating said Twitter account like nothing ever happened. This situation needs to be taken more seriously if you want to calm the storm waters that have begun and that will only continue to get worse as time presses on.

Thanks that helps a lot. You say you use bank transfers, are you talking about Bank of America? I think it would be great if I could tie in my actual bank so I could send funds there but I don't see that option. Or even deposit money that way.

@_date: 2013-04-27 04:38:37
Wait, I'm confused with how coinbase works. I reading their "fine print" it says if/when you buy, you get them for market price at that time. So are your purchases credited at a later time because they don't have them, and now they are honoring at the time you purchased? If so, that means, no matter what, if you pay a certain price for a bitcoin, you will in fact get a bitcoin for that price, no? Seems fair that it should only work out that way.
@_date: 2013-04-21 04:27:44
That's exactly what I've been doing. But it seems every time I buy it drops down and barely recovers. Luckily since doing so I've made a couple bucks just messing around with tenths of bitcoins.

To be honest, what do you think would happen if the stock market crashed? People would freak out that their funds would nosedive never to be returned so they sell to make sure they keep at least what they have. 
Look at bitfloor. It crashed and people thought nothing of it saying "Oh they'll be back, don't worry!" Now look. It literally went belly up and now thousands, potentially 10's of thousands of people (including myself), stand to lose a lot of money. I would sell/pull out as well to make sure I at least get my money.

@_date: 2013-04-13 05:12:21
So how does this process work. You choose an amount of money you want to deposit (from where exactly?) then get that nice slip, take it to BoA and pay the exact amount to the proper account, then the money gets put into your bitfloor? Then you can buy bitcoins off of bitfloor?
THanks in advance for any help. I really appreciate it.

Hey I'm sorry to bother you but you seem pretty knowledgeable about the bitcoin process, how did you go about selling off your bitcoins? What site did you use and were limits a factor? I noticed that most sites have limitations on how many you can sell or withdraw and they're usually pretty low. Which confuses me because I don't know how people can sell off so much so quickly with such small limits (like 50 or 100 bitcoins a day)
Thanks in advance for any response. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:24:23
I have another quick question, when you go to buy/trade your bitcoins, you post how many you want and at what price or how many you want to sell at what price. How does it all end?

This is the simplest question that doesn't seem to have an answer. There is no protection against someone "gaming" the system if one of the creators decides to right?

You can't go to jail over it by changing the algorithm and profiting (the creators)

What do you use to deposit, buy, and hold your money? I was thinking of using bitfloor to get money then deposit it through Bank of America and have it go to my Mtgox account. Then pay for things through Mtgox (I'm in the process of being verified) then once I get bitcoins and decide to sell, I'll sell through Mtgox and transfer my money to my blockchain.info digital wallet. Does that sound right?

I don't care what you do if you do anything at all, that's your choice, but seeing as how Roman (owner of Bitfloor) doesn't even care to provide an update or any acknowledgement towards the people who used his service pisses me the hell off.

@_date: 2013-04-21 03:23:18
But can we expect rapid decreases like we saw a few days ago to happen? It was cruising at around ~100-110 then just bombshelled to $50. How do people know when bitcoin is doing well and not?
@_date: 2013-05-02 05:10:03
You know what? I'm happy you're trolling representing Bitfloor's PR team because you will anger even more people and cause even more hatred to Bitfloor (I'm sure that's what you want). Roman will see the damage you are causing and have to update us with some more credible information. So go ahead and act as if Bitfloor is burning to the ground with all our money. Roman will have to step in sooner or later.
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:30:09
Some users have 10's of thousands, possibly 100's of thousands of dollars locked in Bitfloor and they just stopped everything. I still don't fully comprehend what is happening. They are just getting a nice fancy check that has millions of dollars on it and it's their duty to distributed it equally according to accounts? I don't understand the logic behind any of this and it sounds like money laundering.
Hope for the best; expect the worst.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:10:22
Yeah, not quite sure what those people were thinking. Maybe they thought $100 was the "resistance." I don't see a bottom anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:29:24
How does one do research in order to get a good feel for the market? It seems the market shifts opposite of whatever I'm thinking. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:14:49
What happens when all the bitcoins get discovered? Won't people just horde them because they don't want to lose them? The hording will continue and just bottom out. Another possibility is that the set number of bitcoins will shift around and ultimately a small majority will hold the majority of the bitcoins and can control the market anyway they like.
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:35:26
Well it seems that you just send over money then he converts it into BTC on the spot. You don't get to choose. At least that's what it seems if you go through the steps.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:14:17
With dwolla, can't you only use it once you've had it for a month? How about money gram to fund Mtgox?
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:48:02
Is it instant or can I delay when you send me BTC. What I mean is what if the market is shooting down and I want to buy low, can I "time" when I buy my BTC from you or is it basically when you get my money you get my bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-09-04 04:40:42
Well fuck. I deleted the app and tried to use an old iTunes backup from my computer. I got the old Authenticator app back but everything was still deleted. What the fuck was google thinking?
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:18:28
Exactly. Hope for the best, expect the worst. It seems things are getting all in order before the money ships out in one fell swoop.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:26:17
Well I'm just going by trends and analysis of the charts. For the last 7 days we've been seeing decline and with bad news about Canada and the new bitcoin ATM having a falling out, it just doesn't spell good for Bitcoin at the moment. It's price correction, just like in the first crash, which took many months to recover. Bitcoin is very volatile and price correction is occurring. I don't know who really believed bitcoin going from ~266 to $50 and expect it to go back up to ~160 and stay there.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:28:45
Who is that user and it seems like everyone hates him (downvotes).
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:24:59
Do I have to go to BoA every time I want to buy bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-09-07 21:39:32
This little charade cost me quite a bit of money (haven't sold so technically haven't lost) but it made me realize that I need to be using Authy. What I have on GA is now on Authy so thanks Google for letting me part ways.
@_date: 2013-05-09 03:07:35
Trading is unphased? Maybe bitcoin users are no longer afraid of the might Mt.Gox crashing. That's definitely some good news.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:02:35
Then how do you explain difference between what you would get with no fees and what you received with fees? The only variable are the fees, no? I don't think people are either grasping this concept or just don't want to understand it but if there were no fees you WOULD make $100. But there are fees, which ding you down to $83. Why are you thwarting the fact that the difference is the % in fees you paid. I don't follow your logic.
@_date: 2013-05-02 04:39:33
I'm confused because my money has been sitting in my Bitfloor account under ACH "pending" for who knows how long. What's stopping it from going through? Why not set up another bank account and have people pull out their money like they did before?
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:41:31
I always wondered how people cash out all their coins so quickly. Most places have limits on bitcoins they can sell, and how do they justify to their banks the 10's of thousands of dollars flooding their account? Won't they flag it and then have to pay Capital Gains on their profits?
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:21:55
Where should I create a new wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:07:10
I get that as well. It turns into about a 5% fee overall. But with the example above, why do the fees take so much out in that case?
@_date: 2013-04-28 18:35:49
Should you just disable Java from your internet browser or uninstall java from your control panel?
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:09:48
Are you in the US? If so what are the fees for international? Thank. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:27:38
At this rate, it will have quadrupled or x5 by the time we get our money :( but I still have faith that BTC will continue to rise.
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:21:15
But it's not a single entity. Think what would happen if more people used bots to game the system even more. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:10:38
So in reality, the early adopters hold a significant amount of bitcoins and can theoretically crash the market, no? What's stopping people from doing this?
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:50:42
Could you explain how to do this? I have a Dwolla account setup (currently waiting for my bank account to receive the 2 small deposits) but what you're saying, I can then link my bank account with Dwolla, use it through bitinstant, to have it fund my Mtgox account? Could you provide a step by step process on how to do this? Is this possible all on the computer or do I still have to use a moneygram with bitinstant?
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:40:54
I think this is the biggest pitfall for bitcoin and the biggest reason why it will never become a true currency. As it does gain more popularity, the HFT will only impact it that much worse and eventually just fail because of it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:56:48
Well how come I cannot edit any of my personal information or remove any information from my account, it seems it all has been locked.
I want to thank you for taking the time to answer my question; I appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-04-24 19:52:43
How do you back them up offline? Where do you keep them online to trade/sell?
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:51:55
How are you able to see this "wall"? I see others mentioning it and I don't understand how it works.
@_date: 2013-05-04 08:40:12
There's nothing in the "pending" so I don't know what else it could be. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:28:51
What's really the point of a wallet? Why not keep money/bitcoins within the exchange? Is that a bad thing especially that places like blockchain.info has been hacked into recently?
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:36:55
No that was very accurate and helped a lot. Thank you for that detailed analysis.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:05:45
All right so you first deposited money to buy bitcoins, then basically just moved bitcoins around. The reason I ask about the fiat is because looking at the charts, they are selling for different amounts. Bitfloor is by far the fastest to deposit money because they are in NY, but they are also selling at the highest $115. Mtgox is in Japan so depositing money would take a while and the market could shift a lot by the time I even have the funds to buy. Same thing with BTCe, they're the cheapest but also seem the sketchiest because everything is in Russian and I can't use a BoA deposit to move money there. What would you suggest?
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:00:33
So you did the Money Gram/Bitinstant thing at like a CVS for Mtgox?
@_date: 2013-09-04 05:04:25
I'm jailbroken and don't want to lose it. What I did was delete the new app on my phone (hadn't been transferred over to my computer) then went to my computer to install Google Authenticator from my iTunes list (old backup). I got the old app back but all the data was removed.
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:10:57
but I feel when people go into a buying frenzy coinbase will shut down again for another week.
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:41:31
Look at the July 2011 crash. It took months for the trend to turn back around. We are still on the downturn and I except the price to go to $50 and below before it steadies. But that's just me and what I've seen happen in the past after a huge bust.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:55:14
I was thinking of using Bitinstant to deposit funds into my Mtgox account with a moneygram? Do you think that's a good idea? Also, when paying with a moneygram, do I have to bring cash or can I just use my debit card?
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:58:02
Wait, so you just recently used Bitinstant for a moneygram to deposit funds? I was thinking of using Bitinstant soon to put deposit money in my Mtgox account faster than wiring money through Bank of America. Is that not a wise choice using bitinstant to deposit funds?
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:46:34
You should not bring emotion into trading. That's when people lose. Think of it this way, you haven't lost anything until you sell.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:20:53
No, I mean't on the fact that they charge a fee on the BTC you buy, and then a fee on the total amount of USD when you sell.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:59:59
How do those work? Do you just put in your debit card or what? I am a little confused how the online paying works.
Thanks for the help in advance.
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:01:52
Could someone do an ELI5 on why this is bad? Is the price going to shoot down because of they control over half of all BTC? Sorry for my ignorance.
@_date: 2013-08-12 15:49:05
'Tis a happy day. Dodgers are on a roll and I got my refund from Bitfloor. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:39:55
So could you explain how your website works? I pay you and then you send coins into where? Sorry for my stupidity.
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:51:18
How much in fees did they take? Did you use bitinstant?
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:09:38
Dumb question but by ACH you mean linking/verifying a bank account in Dwolla? Because that's why I have done and then I have it pull the funds directly from my bank account (4-5 business days) to arrive in Dwolla. Is that what you mean by ACH?
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:08:53
Lol, poor math skills? Name the line that is incorrect and I'll be gladly to say I have poor math skills. As it stands, Mt.gox takes fees on whatever you receive, whether it bee bitcoins or the price you sell. The numbers don't lie.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:21:09
One more question, it seems everyone wants a secure deposit for the exchanges, bitfloor, Mtgox, BTCe, I don't want to have to go to Bank of America every time I want to buy/sell from those. Is it possible to put say $500 into bitfloor, then transfer that money to the different exchanges that way? Or am I stuck going to BoA every single time?
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:55:07
I did that the first time and it cost $80 in fees for a $500 deposit. Mtgox took 30 and my bank charged $45. I'm from the US so it was pricey. I want to avoid that.
Would money gram be the only option?
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:42:02
 is pretty good.
 always a solid website as well.
@_date: 2013-04-24 05:05:28
Just did that and I see that it only costs 0.25 to put money from Dwolla into CampBX. THat's a hell of a lot better than freaking 4% Bitinstant and international wire transfer from MtGox.
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:21:19
If someone accidentally did this, how do they go through their system to check for any weird programs running?
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:56:39
But that is what's occurring. If there were no fees you would have gotten that $200 but you got $150, so why would in be incorrect to say the fees are 25%?
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:28:17
were you the one just now making all those micro transactions?
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:56:00
I was thinking of using Bitinstant to deposit funds into my Mtgox account with a moneygram? Do you think that's a good idea? Also, when paying with a moneygram, do I have to bring cash or can I just use my debit card?
Thanks in advance for the help.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:26:38
You know I keep telling myself that (the past 4 days to be exact because I sold @ $98) and I am starting to believe that it's going to continue up. The price is increasing but not at as fast a rate as the first bubble. I think until we start to see that growth again is when to jump ship. I playing with a little bit of money to try and gain some but I am holding most of mine to buy when it hits a low.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:01:03
I have another quick question, when you go to buy/trade your bitcoins, you post how many you want and at what price or how many you want to sell at what price. How does it all end? Someone with the same numbers as you gets matched up and the sell is final or what? Sorry I am fairly new to this but want to make sure I know how everything works.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:17:26
Of course to see it succeed then once they have the possiblity to bring in millions possibly billions, they cash out, crash the market and it bottoms out. Bitcoin just seems like another business that has the chance to fail at any moment with no reason to push it forward only on the hopes of people wanting it.
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:08:27
I can only imagine a big player like the Winklevoss twins just getting their BTC stolen and not being able to do anything. Until a big player with a lot of money and influence gets targeted, things won't change and will just continue to be, "well tough luck."
@_date: 2013-04-21 02:33:53
Yeah I did the same thing. Nothing is "pending" and they don't have anything in my account. I don't know where my money is, probably in limbo or something. We'll see by Monday I guess... ughhh.
@_date: 2013-05-14 02:54:19
Could you possibly shed some light on how to secure one's computer better? All I've heard is to use linux. I've seen people get their accounts broken into even with all the security but windows seems to be the weakest link.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:28:46
I get that completely. I'm just trying to wrap my head around why you can't relate or compare the predicted profit without fees to the actual profit when including fees. I guess what I'm trying to say is if someone asked me, you you sold 10 for $10 more, that's a cool $100 you just made. No not really, I only made $83.5. Holy shit, really? They took a lot out because of fees. That's the part where I'm stuck.
EDIT - I guess it's because I am comparing the fee to just the profit instead of the whole transaction. Still looks a little odd to me but oh well. Thanks for all the help.
@_date: 2013-04-20 04:15:43
How much are these avalon miners and what do you need in order to run them?
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:13:58
I wouldn't worry. The last malicious DDoS attack actually spiked the price $30 so you are probably in good hands. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 04:45:15
I guess iTunes doesn't store app data in the backup because it wasn't in the app when I synced from an old file.
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:04:10
To be honest, people are getting wiser. The longer I'm in the game the quicker I'm starting to realize that yes, people do panic, but it rebounds right away. Bitcoin is here to say and will bounce right back up. Today it dropped 15 dollars and then shot right back up. These fools think they'll get it below $30? HA! I think they are full of shit personally and just trying to scare people and nothing will actually happen. They are stupid and realizing their DDoS attacks aren't as effective anymore so they are trying harder and looking more desperate. I doubt it will go under $100 and will be back up above $120 within 10 minutes. 300% profit, lol.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:40:41
That makes sense. I guess I was just thinking if there were no fees I make X but since there are fees I made Y so the difference divided by total would be actual fees.
I completely follow your logic and thank you for taking the time to write that out; I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:38:51
Bitfloor could learn a thing or two from Mt.gox if they wan't to continue being in a business where they handle people's money. This is a way to inform their users and make sure their customers are in their best interest.
Thanks for the update.
@_date: 2013-04-21 03:17:42
That's why I am wondering how people can day trade off of bitcoin. With stocks, it's a little bit easier in that you know relatively how a company is doing that day but with bitcoin it can go up and down at the drop of a hat it seems very risky and stressful.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:13:21
Whatever about the final fee transaction %. But the fact of the matter is you get the fee applied to your total order every time, correct? I just want to make sure I understand the fundamentals of how the fee works.
You buy BTC, they take a portion of the BTC you bought. You sell all those BTC, they take a portion of the money you received?
Would you agree with that?
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:18:54
Really stupid question but what is the use of tipping? Especially when it's around $10-15?
@_date: 2013-04-22 22:07:00
What does a pool do that makes it better than solo?
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:44:55
I went ahead and did that and linked my bank account but don't I have to wait 30 days and be verified?
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:20:34
I'm trying to stay positive and think to myself maybe the price will decline a lot by the time we get our money back.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:17:12
So do you have a bot do this. I don't quite understand what's going on. You make orders then cancel them or do you actually buy?
@_date: 2013-04-16 02:57:51
It will only go lower in my opinion. After the crash in 2011, it took months before it saw a reverse in the trend.
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:17:12
So you used bitfloor for trading and sometimes bitstamp and BTCe. Which one do you prefer most?
@_date: 2013-10-23 04:38:34
Can you withdraw money into your bank account easily like you could with CampBX?
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:55:48
I was thinking of using Bitinstant to deposit funds into my Mtgox account with a moneygram? Do you think that's a good idea? Also, when paying with a moneygram, do I have to bring cash or can I just use my debit card?
Thanks in advance for the help.
@_date: 2013-05-01 05:12:24
Had ACH, pulled it out on 17th, it was "approved" and left my account. News broke that it was denied but was not in my Bitfloor account nor my bank account. Few days later the money is back in my Bitfloor account under "pending". We'll see how this turns out. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:26:23
How many hash is that if you don't mind me asking? Are you part of a pool as well?
@_date: 2013-04-18 20:17:59
Is it easy to get into? I like Bitfloor as well but Campbx seems too small.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:10:27
Which one do you prefer? Sorry I am very new to this but I have been researching and registering everywhere.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:10:15
Mt.gox takes fees on whatever you receive, whether it bee bitcoins or the amount you sell. It doesn't take into account profit, just the totals at what you sell. You buy 10 BTC you get 9.94. You sell 10 BTC for $10 each, you get $100 - 100*0.006. It's quite easy to follow really.
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:07:00
I am saying ~$100 lowest.
@_date: 2013-04-24 04:46:07
Ok. Sounds good, I guess I'm just a little hesitant to trust Bitinstant with all the commotion. I know people that have issues are the loudest. When was the last time you used Bitinstant?
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:07:50
You think 8 seconds is bad? Yesterday the peak was ~2 mins. During the 266 crash it was 6 minutes. 8 seconds is nothing. Just sit back and watch as bitcoin becomes more affordable.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:42:44
What do you mean by Dont leave your bitcoins or cash in the exchange, where would you put it blockchain.info or another ewallet? Are they easy to go back and forth and aren't there fees transferring back and forth?
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:17:15
Exactly what I was thinking, which is what made me more nervous. I only have $500 in there and I can only imagine what the high-rollers had. Possibly 10's of thousands of dollars. Right now the money is in my account under "pending" for ACH and under holds. So it looks like as soon as he gets things in order the money will ship out immediately.
It's just nice to have some reassurance since he's been rather quiet on the western front about all this.
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:00:46
So what do you do with the money? Transfer it to your bank account, pay capital gains, risk your bank freezing the funds? Or leave it in the exchange and then buy back in later on? It takes a lot to move USD in and out of an exchange, and sometimes it's very expensive. Why pay to move it in and out?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:28:38
Thank you for that. I have a question though. A lot of these things are asking me to deposit an amount basically into a wallet so I can buy a bitcoin. Say the price of a bitcoin is $100, I see that and go to deposit and with fees I pay ~$110. I get a nifty little slip that I take to the merchant. In that time it takes me to get pay the merchant, the bit coin jumps to $200. Does that mean I'll only get $100 worth of bitcoins (so 0.5 bitcoin) or is my deposit locked it at whatever the price of a bitcoin was. I'm confused with all this wallet and depositing stuff, if I'm even buying a bitcoin when I make a deposit with a money gram or BoA.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:11:39
Well it beats having to go do a stupid moneygram down to the local CVS or something. Then again, that way is probably faster because you don't have to wait for funds to be transferred.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:46:08
How easy is dwolla?
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:20:46
I don't understand the downvotes but I guess I could explain. At the time the price had already dipped below $100 once and went back up and was decreasing *again*. Why would anyone put such a huge order when the hour before the prices were falling like crazy. I wouldn't touch the market with a 10-foot pole today. If the users just waited about 5 more minutes, they would have gotten in at ~$93. It's quite simple when you stare at the charts.
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:49:47
So should I just create a new blockchain.info wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:01:21
So can I run this by you (sorry for sounding so stupid).
1. I setup a Dwolla account and link my real bank account to it.
2. Go to bitinstant and select Dwolla to send money to Mtgox account number
3. It will then use my bank account to send funds through bitinstant (using dwolla) and fund my Mtgox account. 
Is that correct? Do I still have to wait the 30 days for my dwolla account to be "verified"?
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:27:04
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:11:34
So if I want to buy bitcoins I have to play ~2-5 days in advance for Mt.gox to get my money I sent through moneygram? That seems very inconvenient and the market could be completely different in that time. What if I put my money in, and the time it takes for them to put it in my account shit has bottomed out. Is that just a risk to take and eat the fees getting my money back?
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:04:52
Definitely. I was just very worried because I didn't see my funds in there but Roman was saying it didn't go through. I thought to myself how would I get my money if nothing was in my account and everything got approved? Now it's back in my Bitfloor account and at least it's not gone forever.
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:32:52
Per person. I've seen limitations like you can only sell 100 bitcoins or withdraw $1000 for your account a day. The guy that took out $30,000 worth of bitcoins, how the hell did he sell ~2200 bitcoins ($14/each) in a couple of days. If shit hits the fan why isn't the option of selling it all there?
@_date: 2013-04-15 04:15:51
Could you possibly send bitcoins to an Mt.gox account or no?

Cool fee calculator. I did the same thing but used Excel. I have a macro that calculates the price I need to sell to break even/make a certain profit. I have it set for Mt.Gox buy/sell, CampBX buy/sell, Campbx Buy--&gt;Mt.gox Sell. Pretty handy.

How are people bruteforcing passwords without 2FA? I mean you'll have to know their username and then have to get their password. How does one do this unless the OP logged onto a public computer and left it for some reason. I don't understand. I have 2FA on everything but still how do people get their passwords?

People are probably scared of what happened to Bitfloor. Could you imagine potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars being lost?
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:42:00
I did, he hasn't responded :(

That's a good point but I made a transaction immediately after and didn't get any fees taken out. Here is a picture of my entire transaction history:
Maybe you can find something with that.

So what do you expect will happen?

Are these plug and play or do you have to have a separate machine to run everything?

I have a Mac and tried it but it didn't work. Everything was still deleted when the old app was out on my phone.

what is "fiat"? sorry for the dumb question.

Do you meet in person or do the online transaction? If both, which one do you prefer?

I have another quick question, when you go to buy/trade your bitcoins, you post how many you want and at what price or how many you want to sell at what price. How does it all end? Someone with the same numbers as you gets matched up and the sell is final or what? Sorry I am fairly new to this but want to make sure I know how everything works.

Did you use bitinstant to send to Mtgox?

How do people fire sell their bitcoins?

I just did a $20 deposit to bitfloor, can I cancel it? What if I don't go through with it? Can I use my debit card to pay for the deposit or do I have to bring cash? I don't even bank with BoA are they going to charge me an extra fee?
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:30:14
So my plan was to put funds into bitfloor via BoA. Once they are on bitfloor I was going to buy bitcoins with that money. Now, what you're saying is to move those bought bitcoins as soon as possible? I have a blockchain.info wallet, you suggest once I buy the bitcoins to move them directly to blockchain? And I do that by transferring them with my wallet ID thats like 30 characters long?

Oh, instead of cash deposit -&gt; Mtgox you did Dwolla -&gt; Mtgox?

Awesome man! Things like this will grow and help bitcoin succeed.
