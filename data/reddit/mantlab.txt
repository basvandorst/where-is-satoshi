Just enter a 10 or 100 and you can see exactly what the rate is. And you can compare this to whatever other fixed rate exchanger you can find and take into consideration how long the whole transfer would take.
Yes you can save when using a market but only if the price of Bitcoin goes down else you lose.

Blizzcoin doesn't have 7 digit decimals. Don't know where you got your numbers from. Certainly not from 
As for price differences with market data. If you want to change your EUR to USD at any bank or cash exchange you will get a fixed price. 
Of couse you could open a forex account and do the USDEUR trading yourself and save (or lose) some %. 
Trading Bitcoins can make you money but that's gambling on the future price of Bitcoin where you can either win or lose.
