I will soon reach this. But as of now, Im proud owner of several satoshis. Lol

The truth and beauty. Doesnt matter if you invested i  2012, you still cant 100% predict the trend.

Stocks also went ATH just before the 2008 crash

With my price prediction averages based on dates of bitcoin halvenings, nxt year during the halvening would be 26,848.02 and 1 yr after halvening would be 156,323.945.

Please emphasize. I dont know the correlation

Ive read that its Nov 16. What I love about bitcoin is the unpredictability of it. No matter what anyone says, nobody could predict it. All we have to do is just trust whatever our guts tell us to do and either regret or be happy of what weve done.

I have a noob question, I have been using a hosted wallet for years, does this mean I own the keys? Or not?
@_date: 2019-12-18 01:46:52
Im okay. Bought my 60% of savings at 8k, and now Im doing ok. I know Im okay.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:43:08
Well maybe his statement will cause the price to reach 6k. Hhhmm����
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:46:25

@_date: 2017-09-04 13:34:19
So basically, this is a religion. Lool but I do know that Im in the right direction, shouldve got into earlier.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:38:53
Hold it and go for the moon
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:56:44
Now im ready for the shoot to the moon
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:01:15
Well, Im looking in the bigger picture though, so I think Im in the direction. I just hope I am actually in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-09-12 01:16:48
Lol I invested 85% of my savings and it is still like .03% of yours.
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:35:10
Well, I bought my first bitcoin at 4400, almost got to 5k, then the dip happened.. the graph showed slow upward tick panic-bought my remaining money by 4200. Then now another dip happened... So basically my first experience is making unrealized losses. Im hoping the next week it will reach 5k. And im missing this dip also. Got no money anymore.

Reply it.

Tldr, this is still a speculation but from an experienced source
@_date: 2019-05-15 06:12:51
If you can afford, your decision, because when it all goes to hell, at least you could afford it.
