In the future many people will regret not having bought at $13,800

What if the dip gets deeper?
Buy low, sell lower?
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:06:30
Great, you bought low now you're going to sell lower.

Be prepared to book a visit to your local lambo dealership

I'm gonna be laughing at you when those BTC you had will be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2030.

I thought I was the only one... The funniest part is that I did this back in April so It's like I just received 1 year worth of my wage in just 5 weeks lol.

Which is the best exchange to cash out a little in the USA?
 I have an emergency and need some quick cash.

Buy low sell lower

Imagine selling shitcoins so shitty that not even the house wins
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:23:50


Sorry to hear about that... Is your house ok?
I'm studying all the technical aspects like coding too, the more I learn the more I get caught into.

It's ok
The longer the cheaper the more you can accumulate

Imagine if somehow he managed to accumulate 3 million coins.
And imagine if he wanted to dump them all at once on Dec 2017.
There wouldn't be enough liquidity to take his order.
He would send the price straight to $0
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:17:44
Hmmm sooo....
How many "this is the last time you will see BTC under 10k" do we have to go through before we hit 15k?

Ok now I officially f***ing hate banks, went to withdraw $3000 USD and got treated like shit, they asked me hundreds of questions and made me fill a long ass form and had me waiting in the bank more than 45 minutes... ITS MY STUPID MONEEEEYY and it's not even a big amount...
This is why I'm putting the rest of my life savings into BTC, screw banks and their stupid archaic system.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:42:21
If I place a purchase order at that price and the price is reached is it even fulfilled? Or is it just some bug? I've seen plenty of em flash crashes.

Hello red candles my old friends, I've come to panic sell again...
