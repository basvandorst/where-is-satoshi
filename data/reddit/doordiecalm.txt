hate to break it to you but every time you make a bitcoin transaction,  its part of your so called 'dollar paradigm'.  
If I sell a service and accept bitcoins as payment, a USD/EUR/DOLLAR value is tied to that transaction.  
If BTC = 600 USD and I have a service that I charge $1200 USD for, then I would accept 2 BTC at the current BTC value and ideally offload that as soon as possible to get actual value.  Say you accept 2 BTC for the service that you value at $1200 and 4 hours later the price drops to $550, well then you lost ACTUAL money due to volatility in this "currency". Essentially its almost identical to offering shares of stock as opposed to currency for transactions.

Then his website is certainly misleading especially given the fact they offer seminars on "Helping professionals get up-to-date on bitcoin" when 3 months ago the author couldn't even answer simple questions about bitcoin for a radio interview - so much so that he came on reddit asking for help.

One of the benefits of having a cryptocurrency that relies entirely on the internet - a place where the facts are false 90% of the time.

And the author doesn't have a vested interest in misleading individuals about it's validity? Is the author of this not a bitcoin investment consultant?

And no one makes the ponzi scheme connection with this?

LOL @ comparing 4900% Bitcoin appreciation vs Berkshire Hathaway. Who is misleading who?
