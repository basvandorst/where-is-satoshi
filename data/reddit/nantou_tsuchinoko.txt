This suggestion actually sounds pretty damn nice. Rule of Three strikes again. 24 is also divisible by 3, so that's amazing.

I didn't think it needed to be said, but that's a huge part of what we're trying to avoid ._.

I've been hearing a lot of transactions that aren't going through because of high volume of transactions lately. My btc's stuck on an exchange for a while despite getting my Ledger a few days ago because of this.
Can someone tell me if there's a good time to be moving my bitcoins to a hardware wallet? I don't want my bitcoins forever in limbo.
Thank you.

I got a glimpse of  and saw that every single currency except btc-related ones are dipping in the reds lately. There's a number of reasons for this, but I'm mainly interested what that means on a long-term for:
*people who are only holding bitcoin  
*people who are holding multiple cryptos  
*people who gave up bitcoin for other cryptos
*people that are just starting to get into cryptocurrencies
I'm not very knowledgeable in this, so I have no basis for any sort of predictions whatsoever.

unfortunately I live in a country that gdax nor coinbase supports. The exchange I'm using right now is currently the most efficient in terms of fees and reputation in our country.

how much in fees did you have to pay? I'm checking it right now, low is 26 USD, high is 30 USD in bitcoin (as of time of writing this comment)...
