I'm pretty sure the son of God already knew Reddit would exist even before electricity was invented, so no surprise He has an old account.

When has the Motley Fool ever been bearish about Amazon? For me it shows up they have been recommending Amazon continuously since at least 09/06/2002

Compared to the global stock market, Bitcoin is still an ant. And even the stock market was able to go down ~40% in 2008/2009.
There will never be a size where Bitcoin is 'too big to crash'.

You go short on something when you believe the price of something (stock/commodity/currency) will go down. You then profit if it actually goes down, but you will lose if it goes up instead.
This can be very dangerous, because when the price goes up a lot, you can lose all of or even more than what you invested.
The easiest way to do it (there are several ways) is if I lend you something and then you immediately sell it. Later you buy it to give it back to me.
Example: Yesterday BSV was about $100 a piece. BlueFin could have borrowed a BSV from someone and immediately sell it for $100. Right now he could buy a BSV for about $85 and give it back for a $15 profit. Of course had BSV gone up to, say, $115, then BlueFin would've been in a $15 hole.
