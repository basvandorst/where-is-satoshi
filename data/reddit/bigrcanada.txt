I'm going to do some background on this to understand the jest between all 3. It would be helpful to have a graph or table comparing these 3 technologies.

Wow dude! Really? Do some real research first before you putting your foot in your mouth! 
@_date: 2015-03-22 22:28:54
Dude.. So low class for core Dev to be slinging mud!  Trailer park behaviour!  But since your talking Smack... Which you never see Evan as he is far to much of a gentleman and class act to slung mud here... Let's put you    money where your mouth is.   PROVE THAT Darksend does not work by cracking it... In other words put up or shut up!  Show us that you can physically break Darksend.  Until till the  your behaviour shows you being a Fudster!

It is unbelievable that 2 core devs have spent the better half of a couple of days Trolling Darkcoin's Forum and Reddit and advertising their coin on a Darkcoin announcement, such unbecoming and classless behavior for xmr devs .  You guys are an embarrassment to your coin!
Evan...thank you for being a total constant professional and for not engaging is such low brow behavior.  We are fortunate to have you at our helm.  This...more then anything speaks volumes of who we are to professional investors and early adopters.

No fluffy....the onus is on you break or crack Darksend!  Any other discussion from you is BS!  
And please Fluffy your behavior is extremely unprofessional for a core dev of a coin.  Shilling and spamming your coin on a Darkcoin announcement reddit proves how classless you guys are.  Evan's demeanor is  a shining example of  conduct becoming of a professional and one developing what could turn out to be a global currency solutioin.  \If this all goes mainstream his conduct will speak volumes.

Break it or shut it about our technology.... That is it that is all.  Like I said I'm putting money where my mouth is... You should do the same.  Break it... Or beat it... And this is coming from a major holder of your coin too...me.
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:50:22
Yeah I'm holding a bag load of your coin.  Better not make me regret investing in your coin either.... Because I'm starting to get sick of you guys slamming  another coin.  I've never ever seen Evan do or act this way.  Food for thought.

Oh sure... I guess u were right there with him my mining with him... I remember getting good a memo telling get me to join.  Bugger off already.  I'm perfectly OK with it.  Now break Darksend and our technology or go home...! 
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:50:28
Again... Put up or shut up... This is about privacy in your transactions.  Break it and prove it!  Otherwise stuff it......
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:51:34
Hey fuzzy nuts I call BULLSHIT.  Break Darksend.... or shut the hell up. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:19:06
Fine... If your so concerned show us the weakness... Break it!  Otherwise... Take a holiday.  I've my money where my mouth is... Now let's see u do it. 
@_date: 2015-03-22 22:16:23
