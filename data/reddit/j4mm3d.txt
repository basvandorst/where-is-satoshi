It seems like there is *some* trust involved though until the blockchain verifies, exactly like every other transaction (e.g. visa charge-backs etc, though a lot faster). 
I'm so embedded in btc and its future that I'm trying to explore it from every angle. 
Thanks for the clarification on your process. Mega appreciated.

Completely, 100% agree. There should be no hard switch just an auxiliary representation of the USD price.

Honest question, why is this not free?

I think there is an opportunity here too. It doesn't even have to be a card, simply a NFC phone + app. The store already has to upgrade some technology so why not just a cheap android phone that the customer "bumps" against.

I was thinking back to 1994 and setting up my first email account, man was that a pain. I just wanted to send an email and I think it took me all day with installing (from disk) and learning the intricacies of loads of different types of software).
I think the whole ecosystem is very similar.

There is another problem in transactions for goods &amp; services in that there is an increasing disparity between merchant prices in BTC to those in conventional currencies. With (since yesterdays!) rise of 10%, and such a tiny merchant pool, I find paying with BTC is way more expensive than any other currency, and increasingly so. 
Can merchants ever be expected to be constantly updating their BTC? Will other merchants add that option when their prices become so out of date so fast?
Edit: changed word from "charges" to "prices".

I'm sorry, do you have a link to the relevant page? All my google-fu is returning information at the blockchain stage.

Could you expand on how you can confirm payment instantly, without using the 3rd parties. I'm very interested in the process.

Thats a pretty spammy list. Upon clicking randomly on the list, half goto 404 (ugh), and the rest seem scam-like or low value.

Right. The UK's position is so backwards when we should be one of the prime movers in this market. Hell, as a financial services reliant economy we need to be.

Ha! I used to live in Copenhagen where all transactions are via Dancard (their own internal no fee debit card). And still the few homeless would ask for change. No-one ever had any change in that country, yet they'd still ask. How many years of unsuccess do they have to go through?
In another surprising sense, there is [very little digital divide between the homeless and the non-homeless]( Theres no reason why BTC adoption couldn't extend there too.
