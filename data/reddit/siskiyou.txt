governmental over reach. I wonder what else will be taken away.

What percentage of people do you think feel this way? I think most people would happily give up their freedom. I've pretty much had it.

The other thing is that a lot of money is launder in exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. They don't want those trades public.

I don't know exactly why I did not. I got into Bitcoin fairly early, before it was in the news much. It was sort of a leap of faith. I guess I extended that leap of faith to MtGOX. I remember getting an email that the money transfer between MtGOX and my bank account was taken down by the US gov. I moved my Bitcoin out at that point. Later I moved my Bitcoin back in hoping to trade it in order to make even more money. At some point the whole thing came tumbling down and I was left with a nice tax bill. I don't blame MtGOX or anyone else. I should have known better. The worst part was having to pay thousands in taxes to the IRS.

Not for this. I checked with an accountant. If it were considered an equity or a currency then those provisions would apply.

LOL. Thanks for the tip. I hope I don't have to report this to the IRS.

I don't think he was malicious either. He is just a bit of a kid that got in over his head. You have to respect him on some level though. He left his home in France and moved to Tokyo to open a business. Not many people would do that.

I blame myself more than anything. I should have known better. Was a learning experience.

A few possibilities include:
1. If major websites like Amazon, eBay etc. started using bitcoin. 
2. Another Euro or Asian financial crisis.
3. The US missing a debt payment.
4. If there was legitimization in another major world economy like India.
5. Pricing by a producer of some sort of commodity in Bitcoin (oil, gold etc.).
