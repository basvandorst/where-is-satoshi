There are advertisements that's say "Don't buy Bitcoin." Someone is literally paying money to undermine the currency. You can't convince me that there's not some level of conspiracy here.

Why is it so common for people to spout empty trash talk in here? Are you subbed to even though you claim to think it's worthless? Is this really what you do with your free time? Or do you at least see why people think that you're being paid to make this stupid comment? Why else would you be wasting your time to keep reading this sub just to come in here and say literally nothing.
