This scambot has been around for a while now and has posted on at least a few, that I've seen probably plenty I haven't, of Musk's tweets. 
It's either the same one or some variation, but it's still surprising it lasts as long as it does. I report it every time, for whatever good that does. 
But just so everyone knows, Bezos, Gates, Musk, Buffet, and whatever other billionaire you want to name, isn't giving away anything and if they were it wouldn't be announced as *a reply to their own Tweet*. Seriously people, stop feeding the scammers.

Some of it is

I agree. If this is something like Dread Pirate Roberts hidden stash, there could be some seriously scary people involved.

That certainly sounds like a fair assessment. Thanks again and I hope you've sent this around the Twitter-verse.

Awesome, thanks for this.
One question though, you mentioned 'usage as a gateway to other cryptoassets' as being included in your valuation. 
Can you elaborate? With regards to Ethereum, I can see this being a factor, but how much weight would this have with regard to Bitcoin?

I just heard about this and I'm glad it's not being listed. 
If someone wants to create a security with Bitcoin as a component, sure, but Bitcoin or any traditional cryptocurrency is not a damn security. 
It's a brand new asset class, but no one wants to spend the time or ink to draft new rules.

I'd say it shows institutions are interested in taking the 'blockchain' and 'cryptocurrency' buzzwords and selling something that isn't either.

Yup - from what I can tell,  'blockchains' being sold to businesses are basically just encrypted databases or networks.
There is no need for the compounding difficulty that exists in a blockchain. It's designed to limit the amount of coins and increases electricity usage - what point would either of those serve for a business?

Standing outside the lambo dealer and waiting. 
... can someone bring me food? This may take a while.
