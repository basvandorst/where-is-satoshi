Then you're beyond my knowledge. 
I suspect a rig takes many months to pay for itself even with free electricity, and like says, it's gonna be hella noisy.
I'd just buy a gaming rig and play games during the day then mine Eth or something at night, if you can sleep through even the fans from a gaming rig going full pelt.

Because you're on and unless you have an ASIC rig you'll not get a single block however many hashes you solve. Bitcoin mining can't really be done on a standard computer any more.
Try one of the alt-coin groups that can GPU mine maybe.

And my tarot readings have been right about 70% of the time. This one is almost certainly right since it's basically "the price will rebound one day". Take that Technical Analysis!

Indeed, it could easily be a signal that this is the bottom.

Indeed, dogecoin seems much more about tipping each other with stupid monopoly money than serious investing with thousand-dollar coins.
Which could be a winner!

Indeed. Superstition and anything doesn't work. I started it when I started looking into Technical Analysis as a sort of control-variable. Which would work better, stupid nonsense, or Technical Analysis?
So far about the same, both of 'em mostly working by confirmation bias, vagueness and multiplicity of prediction.

Crikey, you guys certainly aren't lacking ambition! This sounds awesome. Proper revolutionary stuff. Hope you can make it work. 
I don't have a lot of programming time to offer at the moment, busy with my much-less-ambitious projects but will certainly consider throwing bandwidth and storage into the pool should you get it all of the ground.

Cosmic Conroy seems to think it's mostly the Binance thing and this weeks tarot reading predicts a phoenix like rebirth.
