How long have you been buying?
If youve been buying since the crash, you're down at least ~$4,000 by my calculations

No, because as I mentioned, it is near impossible to predict the exact height of a bubble. In fact, it often exceeds all rational expectations.
But one can tell when the bubble is about to pop. I did not post that the bubble had popped when the price had crashed from $900 to $450, because there was no reason to suspect it was the end of it based on TA.
Regulation of exchanges has nothing to do with decentralizing fiat. I do not think you understand what decentralization of fiat means. You might consider a problem of fiat, but its your problem because you want Bitcoin to be convertible to fiat and vice-versa. This is a fundamental problem with Bitcoin - that it has come to be valued in fiat, introducing speculation, fraud, volatility, regulation, and so on.

Nice lies bro
It was at $73 actually
The vast majority of people bought in at higher prices than current
Just to give you an idea, BTC-E volume on this day a year ago was just 4.5k Bitcoins, or ~$300,000 at those prices. Compare that to 13K Bitcoins bought on BTC-E at $1095 - or ~$14,000,000
I'm glad you raise the point of how short a time ago it was at such a low price, because that demonstrates how far Bitcoin has to fall, and how short-sighted it is to have thought this bubble was going to sustain such ridiculously high prices

Everyone here who is acquainted with my previous usernames and posts know that I predicted the downtrend the day before it started
Any trader with some experience would have seen it coming from a mile away - it was a textbook example of bubble. Its near impossible to predict the height of a bubble, but you can see when its about to fail (i.e. when the exponential gains start levelling off - big warning sign)
Yes, the big issue is fiat, as you can see is my concern in my other replies in this thread - how are you going to decentralize fiat? Or otherwise find a solution to it?
What you describe is not what is needed, and you know it by your own admission.
'I expect a resolution' is not good enough - sorry, but hopeful pipe dreams dont cut the mustard with rational and skeptical thinkers such as myself

Explain how a 'trustless exchange' works or you have no credibility and no point
Until you can explain how it works and how it will be implemented, its nothing more than an impossible pipe dream
I will reveal to you that I have actually investigated this subject in depth a whole year ago, so I'm probably more well acquainted with the details of what's possible and what's not than you are

Nice pipe dream bro.

Say I want to buy 1 Bitcoin for $100
How does the $100 get from me to the seller?
The virtual monopoly money is irrelevant to this point - I couldnt give less than a damn about the safety of the Bitcoins. What I want to know is how you can prevent fiat from being stolen by intermediaries, And if you think you can, then in what form would that transaction take?
'Open transactions' talks about owner authorization of transfers and balances, but you can't do any of that with fiat - if the exchange wants to take the money and run, they can do so, and it would be to hell with all these virtually maintained checks and balances.
It talks about 'tokens' representing exchanged goods and debts, which reminds me of Ripple.
I was looking this up further, and I found a thread here in January in which someone asked essentially 'Where does the fiat actually go/where is it held in the Open transactions system?'. A person who was either part of Open Transactions or writing in detail on it, replied with a bunch of gobbledigook, which as far as I can tell, didn't actually answer the question despite claiming it did.
So I ask you now - how does fiat fit into this Open Transactions system exactly, and explain in simple terms how it is going to prevent an exchange from taking the money and running (or otherwise be susceptible to loss)

Why would it silence me?
I've already announced in the past that Ive made a killing by shorting Bitcoin via Bitfinex
Theres no way of guaranting he would pay up on that bet anyway (hes probably broke from buying shitcoins anyway - never trust a gambler with debts)
The only reason I didn't reply is because it was a stupid comment that is self-refuting - not to mention it didn't reject any of the points I put forward. His response is essentially "Say that to my face fucker and then see what happens". Its pathetic.

Old bro
They started rolling out this feature about a year ago or so
I know because I was interested in it for my small business
But its not available for Australia
All we've got access to at the moment as an alternative is shitcoins, which I was hoping I could actually use just for split second transactions and not to hold, but it can't even do that!
Can't wait for Google Wallet or similar to roll out to Australia and do what Bitcoin has failed to do
EDIT: BTW for the unenlightened, Google Wallet is completely free, and transactions are free too if you use bank account as OP mentions - you only pay a small fee for credit card

All buzzwords with no real meaning
If you're able to understand what those terms mean, then you should be able to answer this fundamental question in simple terms: How do you decentralize fiat? Or otherwise how can you trust a centralized entity with fiat?

I see you've got no counter argument
Bitcoin confirmed for sewage
