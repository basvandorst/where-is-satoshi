and what exactly is wrong with it?

The anti bitcoin guy's name is Rich Ross, he was factually incorrect about a almost everything in his segment prior to this debate. He said Satoshi is Japanese, Eth has been trading publicly for only 6 months LOL! Send out an encouraging tweet to Dan here for actually giving Bitcoin a fair shake:

LOL! Jump from $1 to $18 in 3 hrs. and 24h volume is just $16K. Looks completely legit lol

I think it is worse. It appears to be a scam.
This is not financial advice: DYOResearch

Wait it gets even better: Not even a plagiarized white paper
This is a heist! At least looks like that for now

FWIW Gemini has been an incredible platform for me. I think it would be worth the wait. I would hypothesize a delay in verification process on any platform due to the influx of users.

Bump! I think this is a very important question. I would like to know too.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:32:59
There is work being done to alleviate (1)
Regarding (2) and (3) I am not sure either. Experts weigh in please?

HAHAHAHAHAHA! I fucking laughed my ass off. I swear to god I would've given you a reddit gold If I had one.

 Andreas is a Bitcoin millionaire now! I &lt;3 you Bitcoin reddit!

My G! **Focus on getting a steady source of income first!** Start saving up. Educate yourself about what makes Bitcoin special. Once you have saved up a bit, then buy bitcoin with &lt; 10% of what you have saved. You can buy bitcoin in fractions. Eg: for $10. Once bought, then HODL! There are tons of stories of people getting rich real quick - but remember for every positive story there are possibly 100 other stories where people may have lost money. Good luck and hope you reach your moon soon!

I have the same questions
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:14:00
ELI5 please?

Total BTC available: 21,000,000
Assuming: 2,000,000 is locked away/lost
Then for a each coin to reach 1 million: $19,000,000,000,000 total market has to be reached.
Thats 19 Trillion (with a T)

Saltiness level at an ATH! If this isn’t a song of reversal. What is?! :-)

I was able to login here and there but was not able to execute trades. :( Thanks for your reply
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:50:46
If I were you, I'd wait for the dip! There is no way on earth this kinda exponential rises sustain. There will be a correction soon.

Is that you HotKatchina?

kraken has been equally unreliable like gemini in my opinion :( So many timeouts
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:53:57
Can you please elaborate? How do you find buyers? how do you take payments and transfer coins? Only way I am able to think of doing so safely is via smart contracts. But that leaves btc in limbo :(
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:47:58
I did not just mean the hashrate. The Txn history is going to get bigger and bigger. This means you will have to invest in bigger/better hardware. Which meands the average joe will not be able to run a full node. Majority of nodes will belong to big entities with deep pockets, which is awful lot like banks of today. This is the kind of centralization problem I am talking about.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:52:47
It was down for the better part of the day. They came back online only like 30 mins ago. Were you able to login ( and or trade) earlier today?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:59:32
OPs post seems genuine and harmless. Why do you feel the need to shit on his post?
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:13:08
So the BitcoinNewsAndUpdates twitter account (a bcash shill) tweeted an article from "Bitcoin Enquirer" that claimed LN will never be a working solution. It was in Jan. I tweeted back at them with the current status and mainnet beta launch news... They blocked me. We are doing all the right things people.

LOL! This joker looks a lot like Gavin Belson from the TV show Silicon Valley.

1. If I wanted to send money to my parents living in another country, doing it via bitcoin is much faster and cheaper. We are talking about a difference of days vs minutes
2. Micro / everyday payments. Nearly impossible with banks because of mediation, fees etc. Can be done with bitcoin. Imagine getting paid everyday. Imagine third world countries where everyday wages can make/break a person's life
3. Not being able to withdraw more than X amount of my own money from the bank without being hassled. Not a problem with bitcoin
4. Bitcoin basically lets you own your own money. Do you know how many people lost their retirement savings because of bad decisions banks made?
5. Inflation. You cannot mine bitcoin in arbitrary amounts. The supply is fixed. It is gold 2.0 in my (&amp; tons of others) opinion
6. This is 2017 and the idea that e-commerce depends on the trust of a central authority seems archaic
