The dual status of bitcoin as property/money makes the IOLTA issue problematic. I would consider it the same as taking X oz of gold (or other tangible property) as a retainer which only requires you to keep it safe, but there's no guarantee the state bar or courts would agree with me. In NY I know the courts already disagree with that.
But, then, an easier way to get around that whole issue is to turn it into USD immediately and throw it into an IOLTA.

I'm a solo lawyer, so the firm is just me, and my support staff. I don't know quite what you'd consider a lot of clients, but I'm fairly busy for a single lawyer. Which, of course, doesn't mean as large a volume of clients as a five, ten, or fifty lawyer firm.
I'm in a university town with one of the numerous in-town universities specializing in engineering, so there seems to be a good tech/bitcoin base here, which is why I think accepting bitcoin could be a selling point in the area.

I would take it because I have clients possibly interested in paying with it. The ethical problems with taking and holding bitcoin are bad enough that it's not a viable option for me, even with your suggested method.
I'm not interested in being a test case, especially considering how harshly my bar deals with lawyers who screw up with client funds/property.
Also, why assume I would convert BTC to USD for trust accounting purposes and then never go back to BTC myself? How I take my money out of my firm has nothing to do with how I handle the funds I hold in trust.

Didn't your PayPal dispute get automatically closed because it was outside of the 45 day window for disputes? How did you get them to re-open it?

The point of currency, whether it's fiat paper; precious metal backed paper; or digital cryptocurrency, is that it's completely fungible and readily exchangeable for goods or services.
If you want fraud protections, or a traceable history, or a  guarantee that the payment method you're using has never gone through less-than-savory transactions, you use a note or other cash-equivalent bank product. Not actual currency.
This weird desire to turn bitcoin into a digital cash-equivalent when it's actually digital cash makes no sense to me.

Ha! Detroit coming back is like flying cars. They've both been promised to be "right around the corner" for a very long time now.

No, dump it in early enough that it sits there long enough to appear on 3 monthly statements.

And there will always be a few people, like the crotchety old 49ers who kept searching for gold in them there hills, who mine through it all with or without profit.

Yeah. This isn't the beginning of anything. This is the end result of multiple decades of failure. It's the result most have seen as inevitable for a long time - more like finally pulling a tooth that has been bad for a very, very long time than like the first signs of some sort of larger collapse.

If the IRS ever comes knocking, I'd take the exact opposite tack with them.
...just saying.

...until it is discovered that you lied about the existence of assets and get charged with some combination of contempt and perjury. They may not get their hands on your BTC, but you'll be spending some time in jail for your trouble.

"...the money that ended in my account was stolen..."
And how did they determine that you had deposited stolen cash? Or were you doing something extremely stupid and accepting checks or something like that...
If it's cash, the cash is yours, and I call shenanigans on this entire story because it makes no sense. If it was checks, and the checks were in some way fraudulent, the money is as good as gone and you have no recourse. You can thank the UCC for that.
But still... I don't believe you.

He could just as easily have handed out $20 bills, or $20 gift cards. It's not the fact that he's giving out free money that makes him a dick, it's the fact that he's attempting to use a gift to evangelize for bitcoin.
There's a time, a place, and a way to spread interest in bitcoin. Christmas gifts for people who have absolutely no pre-existing interest in the subject is absolutely not the way to do it.
