would realizing the sale of btc be factored into the marginal tax bracket for long term gains? 
Say I make $65k a year and sold 3 btc. Would that put me in the 0% or 15% long term tax rate?

did get a receipt fortunately

Ever heard of Joe Buck?

Appreciate it

Hey there friend. 
Same boat as you, bought from an ATM 2 days ago and transaction is still in limbo. No clue how to fix it, and no clue how long it'll be in limbo for. For any warm-hearted miners out there who may view this, this is my transaction ID as well =*(

BitcoinDepot. This was around 7:00pm on Tuesday, 12/19. 
Went and used one called DFW Bitcoin last night and had the coins in 5 mins. Very disappointed; just want to buy some alts :(

purchased at 345 s/b 3 days ago and still waiting so yeah

Just curious - what happens when your transaction was bought from an ATM and it falls out of the mempool?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:29:57
exactly. didn't see any "no girls allowed" signs, did you? 
On the whole, women just don't typically invent or engage in as many or as varied hobbies as men do. It's not sexist. It's not misogynist. It just is.

Men aren't keeping women out of crypto. Women have not chosen to participate up to this point. Watch a netflix documentary.

will do - thanks for the tip

Maybe take 5 minutes to try and obtain a basic knowledge of the subject at hand before you start the bs virtue signaling

Bitcoin maximalists* don't see it as a threat. Google, NASA, and every major tech company are investing billions and suggest otherwise.
A good resource that details the advantages that XMSS offers and explains how simply upgrading to a new signature scheme is not as simple as it sounds
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:17:19
Other coins such as IOTA do utilize WOTS but without a tree like XMSS it's pretty fickle and inflexible.
In short, the crypto community by and large write off quantum computing as a threat so far away that it can be dealt with later or say that they'll just go ahead and plug in a new scheme at a later time. The first position is ignorant and the second sells way short the technical and political challenges in doing that.
QRL currently is the only open source fully audited crypto that utilizes xmss so kudos to the team and community

Was thinking the same thing. Let's see how it goes - Africa is literally their last frontier

With you on the Hal Finney train

No need for an ICO; there is already a thouroughly audited fully Quantum Computing Resistant network live (running 6 months now) for anyone who wants to hedge their bitcoin.
