It kinda sounds like a meshnet/Internet hybrid. 
@_date: 2015-05-25 02:07:13
VPN? 
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:45:40
Yes, it's made by google for profit, not open source. I'm looking for a discussion while playing the devil's advocate by the way, not trying to start shit.
@_date: 2015-05-17 19:11:10
No, and that's why things like Linux will never run as seamlessly as Windows or OSX. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 06:14:54
Well why does the price keep going down? I hate to say it, but it's making me kind of bitter, having bought at 297 and again recently at 236.

Suuuper illegal, dude. Quick, send them to me before they catch you! 
@_date: 2016-01-15 21:55:47
[That's a lot of red, though.]( What happened?
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:33:50
You guys are so dumb, did you all forget the price was over 1,300 a week ago. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 05:02:29
How about the doctors who wrote the report they're referencing.

@_date: 2016-12-19 08:34:57
ITT: a lot of salt going around.
@_date: 2016-11-08 22:36:31
There's ~100 pages of research in the study.
@_date: 2015-08-10 00:50:04
Welp, I just created for truly uncensored discussions. Use it how you will. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:04:59
Or maybe it'll be worth 0.01.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:07:27
I don't understand the significance of bigger block size. Why is this a debate at all? Could someone explain? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:40:44
Oh well that's a cool system. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 10:10:27
Why not? 
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:21:07
This is so dumb, couldn't you just use a VPN to pay with something that isn't tied to your location? 
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:13:04
In fact, don't even connect your computer to the Internet, it's best to physically remove the WiFi card as well as any other radio cards. Then, lock the device in a bunker 12 feet underground. ^^filthy ^^casual 
@_date: 2015-04-09 08:29:26
Fairly Odd Parents anyone? 
@_date: 2016-10-03 20:08:13
And, they wouldn't have to use bitcoin block chain, they could make their own,it really is just the technology they're interested in. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 21:09:00
I can't even buy them. Submitted my info two days ago.
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:51:35
The changetip bot. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:24:40
@_date: 2015-03-12 05:15:42
Alright, time to throw down 29~ for a whole bitcoin. You guys better be right. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 07:46:19
No. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:40:49
Thank you so much for being subtle about the fact that this is your work. 
When I see a post with a title like "hey guys look at my thing I made that was made by me. Me me me I I I made this." I just get sick to my stomach. So thank you for having some class. 100 bits
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:48:04
I'm not sure how this post even got upvoted. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:00:01
You should definitely read or listen to this book. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:33:48
Aaand I'm still waiting for the bitcoin I ordered on Saturday.
@_date: 2015-03-10 22:49:10
Yea except the police have seized bitcoin in the past. But I see where you're coming from.
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:01:31
I'm sure Russia has their own malware. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 06:43:33
Oh no sir, this isn't a straw poll. This is a *study*. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:43:52
Yup, Private Internet Access is only 40 bucks a year. Well worth it for the sense of security. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 08:48:15
@_date: 2015-03-19 03:49:24
There is still the stupid amount of markup. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 06:11:39
Oh no I think I and whoever downvoted you misunderstood you. I thought you meant you'd be making easy money by selling at localbitcoin's rates. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:32:37
*cough* mailinator.com *cough*
@_date: 2015-03-05 07:41:31
I don't get it :/
@_date: 2015-10-31 17:17:14
It's always been this difficult 
@_date: 2015-03-12 05:33:59
What's happening then? 
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:43:52
Yea but they severely overcharge.
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:25:25
Don't you think that's kinda.. wrong?
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:14:14
Oh I see, I thought that was the name of a specific wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-03 16:20:02
I've always been curious to see how the bot works. 
Edit: can I even donate less than a dollar? 
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:15:38
Oh, I was referring to the bitcoin wallet app put out by Bitcoin Wallet Developers on android. 
It works without a central location and without downloading the block chain.
