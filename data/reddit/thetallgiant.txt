His responses were verbal FUs sooo.

Says the fucking NYT... cmon
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:15:26
And Obama lied just as much. The difference is he was a smooth talker and could do it with a straight face.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:09:10
Eh, id rather just have someone whos upfront about it instead of being a snake.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:34:34
No shit

What happens when that trust erodes?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:53:49
Do you blindly believe all the headlines you read?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:14:14
I say we kill 'em all!
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:00:20
And who built the railroads? Transcontinental railroad? Of course the government builds roads, they have a monopoly on it. It amazes me when people try to taught this an example of government going above and beyond. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:23:13
Why? If he has the money..
@_date: 2014-04-30 19:30:26
Whatever beyond anarchy is?
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:23:40
So private funding could do it if the government didn't have a monopoly? Gotcha. Fire departments? Volunteers? I'm fairly sure everyone in a community would be willing to fund a private company that is transparent and would not waste as much. 
It's kind of funny that this argument always turns to the extremes just to justify the existence of taxes or government.. because that's the only way you can come close to maybe justifying it.

Tide goes in. Bitcoin goes up. You can't explain that. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 06:12:24
No, you simpleton. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:37:05
Haha, yesss. I like it. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 04:12:19
Yes, those o so perfect roads...
@_date: 2014-08-09 05:38:01
Resorting to extremes. Again.
No, you can get a nice little bill through small payments and deferments until you get back on your feet (which wouldn't be impossible now you aren't spending a 1/3 of your income towards taxes.) or have some insurance system. There has been plenty of different propositions about this.
Do you actually have a question you want to trip me up on that doesn't resort to ridiculous extremes?
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:49:59
Kick ass and chew bubblegum?
@_date: 2014-08-09 06:03:52
I'm just going to assume you can't read. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 03:56:58
And how exactly are we going to ruin your state?
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:50:54
Where would those files be? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:51:56
I don't believe I had a wallet. I think it was in bitminter
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:03:45
I'm the same way. I'm just some kind of creeper now. I don't think I'll ever buy but it's fun to watch.

Ever drank Baileys out of a shoe?

Kind of like the OG comment?
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:54:48
Seem like pretty standard fare for anyone who lands right of the political spectrum.
Plus it's only 4 issues.
@_date: 2019-12-19 12:23:26
Hell yeah bröther
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:52:18
Jesus, give it a rest.

Mattis was going to stay until February and now theres already a replacement sooo
@_date: 2013-10-02 16:12:13
Yeahhh, that might be the crux here.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:08:17
Ah, thank you you very much, this is all very informative and things that I have been thinking about for a while. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:36:58
Awesome, I've always wondered about this. But that is kind of sad, those lonely bitcoins, just sitting in a wallet...
I'm so very conflicted.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:00:21
So what happens to those bitcoins if they aren't found? Are they gone forever?
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:26:39
Or are they just setting him up? Seems all a little too coincidental, no? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:42:06
I concur. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:21:42
Easy to just break up payments into different amounts, no?
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:15:50
Thank you, still wrapping my mind around the concept. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:41:11
I'm still kind of new to this whole Bitcoin thing. So, the bitcoins still exist outside of that hard drive? As in, more than a physical wallet? More than two places?
So what you are saying is, all someone would need to do is know the address and somehow get the key?
So why couldn't the owner of the hard drive do that, I mean, he should have the private key written down somewhere.
