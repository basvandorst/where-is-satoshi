No one hired you, dead boy. Stop haunting reddit and just cross over already.

I doubt any periodical worth anything would concern themselves with Atlas-wrangled rubbish. Nice site Atlas. Reminds me of my grandma's first Tripod page. I bet she got more hits, too.

SA doesn't care about you anymore child. You're dead, remember?

Atlas is a child suffering from aspergers, ADHD, and Randiasm. To put it short, he's a turd who fakes suicide regularly due to his diseased obsession with attention and over inflated sense of self worth. Since he works at Walmart and has nothing of value (oh the irony), he constantly pretends he's important and posts these diatribes of how he thinks the world should be run. When people don't listen to him, he fakes suicide. The last time he faked suicide the police went to his house and when it was discovered he was just dicking around, they banned him from the forums. Now his ghost haunts reddit where his rehashed self important, twisted and amateur tripe bounces throughout the halls, annoying everyone for all eternity. The end.

Atlas uses as his personal scammy investment spam board. How much have you lost so far dead Atlas? Since you've already kicked the bucket via suicide, who will pay your randian debts?
