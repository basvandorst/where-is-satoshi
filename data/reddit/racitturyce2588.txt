Or maybe he's just chilling somewhere and enjoys his life with that amount of money

I find it weird that sharing a bank account with your gf would be the reason, and also it's weird that they are just not allowing you without explaining? Idk man. Anyway if exchanges does not work out for you, i recommend p2p's. Like lbc (as what you said) but tbh man lbc's reputation is not that great especially with their customer support
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:02:23
it's LOW.

I wish I had invested in Bitcoins when I was in your age. What I did was I traded first, and when I got enough money, I started mining. I look at mining as passive income and trading as my day to day activity. I was using Localbitcoins before but now they have this stupid KYC rule \(which requires you to show an ID\) it sucks so... Currently, I use Paxful now because it's easy and offers so much payment options for me. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 06:04:23
Well I think most sites don't either, sucks tho. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:10:15
" No hard work No scam  \( genuine\)  " sounds a hundred percent legit
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:03:35
Check their subreddit and see for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:48:20
Hey! When I was starting, I found this channel and their videos helped me a lot. Check [What is Bitcoin?]( and [How To Mine Bitcoins]( 
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:51:03
Yeah I use Paxful to trade my coins to giftcards and vice versa. Great feature
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:30:15
I think this was pretty recent when Coinbase implemented KYC. I guess just provide verification once and then change sites.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:13:51
Here a short and sweet video discussing what is bitcoin. It helped me understand it [
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:09:00
Awesome. Not only business, Paxful's doing something good for the people. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:08:28
NOICE! Gonna use this for my personal use. Thanks! But I kinda agree that the last mining logo is like "destroying"  bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:11:25
Maybe but the promise of the Blockchain technology not just for currencies but as way of decentralizing transfers and etc could be, and would be, the future. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:18:17
Most exchanges offers their customers their own wallet but if you want to be more secure, try searching for Copay or TREZOR. But personally I don't like dealing with exchanges, I stick to P2P's. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:31:46
There is a lot of complaints about Poloniex from this and other subreddits. It seems that the major exchanges (Coinbase) lately has one thing in common, poor customer support. That's why I prefer p2p platforms. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:57:38
Yeah, they are always portrayed as this "super poor" country by the mainstream media. But in reality there many of them that are venturing into different businesses. Great people 
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:56:20
It works as a metaphor I guess as both gold and bitcoin has a high value, and both are "mined" 
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:14:16
Hey, here's a short but sweet video I found when I was starting in the industry and its about mining [
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:12:47
I want the prize even though I don't know how this works. I'm guessing you are holding a dog. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 05:14:11
Seems sketchy. Bitcoin's one main point was to never meet the person you're dealing with.
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:12:16
Their subreddit is bombed with complaints from their users, some which are users that can't withdraw from their accounts for 6 months, and counting. I hope CB fixes this.
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:46:27
I've been seeing complaints about Poloniex from this and other subreddits. It seems that the major exchanges lately has one thing in common, poor customer support. That's why I prefer p2p platforms. Anyway, I wish you good luck dear sir. Hope you get your coins back.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:09:49
Here's a good video I found about mining bitcoins [
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:03:29
I was referring how they (Africans) are portrayed by the mainstream media. **Obviously** there are going to be difference between the population's economic/social status.
@_date: 2018-06-22 06:01:01
You should check Paxful. They are a P2P platform that has plenty of buying and selling options and accepts almost all the giftcards I can think of
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:00:14
more and more exchanges are implementing KYC and I see that as a factor why people are choosing p2p's
@_date: 2018-06-19 12:26:12
Wait, for real? Nice. Maybe it's because of the CSR works they are doing lately. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 04:07:13
Man that sucks. Have you tried contacting their support? 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:15:30
If you would check their subreddit now, you will see their problem about support. But I guess it's nice that you are not encountering problems.
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:08:14
I suggest go to a P2P platform like bisq, localbitcoins or Paxful. I personally use Paxful tho, as it allows me to use giftcards to trade. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:24:19
That's gonna be in cryptocurrency in general, as it offers easy financial access where specifically in Africa, institution like banks aren't around as much compared to other places. Good read.
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:36:44
Great CSR for Paxful, contributing and giving back to the people.
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:57:13
Every person is different and it falls down to what is convenient for them. Some prefer to pay a little bit extra for convenience 
@_date: 2018-06-08 01:16:36
But you have to agree that China isn't exactly the type to "decentralize" 
@_date: 2018-06-22 05:13:31
I have just watched the podcast! Amazing how million dollar ideas sometimes comes from doing something good 
@_date: 2018-06-06 12:05:48
Really? If this is fake news, is there anyway to know who holds the most bitcoins?
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:41:25
Probably a pathetic attempt to cover up bad press against them
@_date: 2018-07-26 03:57:34
You cab try Virwox, I think they allow Paypal payments for Bitcoin. But the sad thing about Paypal is it's fees, fucks you up man. But if you are really into it, try checking out p2p platforms that accepts paypal as a payment options. I personally use Paxful (p2p), a lot of users would buy and sell bitcoins using PayPal, go check it out.
@_date: 2018-07-26 04:05:18
Most exchanges are let downs.. (emphasis on MOST)
@_date: 2018-07-26 03:45:55
I understand that this may cause some "commotion" in the r/Bitcoin community, as per the OP said that it gives the [bitcoin.org]( some "commercial" taste. But I have to agree on some comments that it is obviously a sponsored content, which was clearly stated on the site. IMO, whatever site [bitcoin.org]( would accept as sponsor, I'm okay with it, as it doesn't change the fact that it still has tons of useful information for its visitors to digest. One or a couple of sponsored pages aren't enough to boycott the website tbh. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 04:04:18
Venezuela heads for 1,000,000% (a FUCKING MILLION percentage) inflation. I think it's the long term effect of nationalising their oil industry and other political crisis. I read some posts that the minimum wage there is 1.5 USD (holy shit). I believe that cryptocurrecy could help (or save)  the people of Venezuela. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:01:29
I'm sorry to hear that man, better change all of your passwords now. Paxful's team always suggest to enable the Google 2FA for extra security. I suggest enable this on any website (if they have the option). If you want, try to contact their support and ask what happened. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 07:48:50
If we are talking about the most popular exchanges then Coinbase would definitely on the list. It's very easy to use. But exploring their reviews, you can see their users leaving bad comments about them.
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:04:35
Another great move, Paxful. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:45:22
It's sad that people would initially think the bad first out of people. Fake or not, you should be careful especially with money matters. I feel sorry about your mother.
@_date: 2018-07-04 10:18:07
No problem! Welcome to the Crypto world! 
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:34:14
Here's a nice video discussing if Bitcoin is a bubble [
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:38:04
Maybe because most of people don't really understand (or at least didn't try to do so) cryto. I shared it because it's a short and neat article that kinda explains crypto would stick for a long time.
@_date: 2018-07-03 10:51:42
Hey there! You can try to check this subreddit r/BitcoinBeginners. I suggest for you to really research more about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency in general before spending any money on it. Here's a great YT Channel that covers that neatly :[ 
If you want some quick and easy bitcoins, check popular exchanges such as Coinbase and Gemini. But be sure to check their reviews as well. I personally do my coins business with P2P Platforms. I find it more uhh, *lucrative,* I guess.  
@_date: 2018-07-26 04:06:44
Crypto is here to stay, my friend. Now is always a good time to buy. (BUT DO SOME RESEARCH FIRST PLEASE)
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:21:36
I'm Gonna tell you that p2p traders are more happy with the Dip
