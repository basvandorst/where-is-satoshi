you could easily proof that the btc were giving randomly. for instance he could post a txt file with all the addresses posted and every redditor could verify his address is in the txt file (ordered). then he could anounce the winner will be chosen the day after the posted list with a random number (some real lottery pick or whatever). i.e. the last 3 numbers of the.lottery were 563...then the winner will be the 563th address in the list.

Im from spain. He could use the [national weekly lottery]( were a random number is chosen between 0 and 99999.  If for example the list consists of 2350 addresses and the lottery was 56234, then the winner would be 56234 mod 2350=2184th address on the list.

I am not defending him, I just simple point out that things you said are not facts, you may be right in all the things you said; but are you 100% sure?? those are the facts?

" players with positive betting profit were denied any refunds."
That is not true now:
Scam is a strong word when the owner is giving back the BTC and answering all the questions...
"obviously the site operator is playing with the server seed and stealing from his investors in order to make some profit before they all leave."
Would you bet your life on the veracity of that statement??

Of course it is; but he is saying as a fact something that may very well have another explanation...I AM NOT SAYING he is wrong, I am only saying that he may be wrong.
You could be accused of murder and still be innocent; and that doesn't mean that the accusation didn't have any merit either...

Yes, 6 more to be exact.

I guess exchanges are somewhat covered that scenario. i.e, they are not going to accept x100 deposits or withdrawals in that short time.
And the cost of all that hardware is not worth the new price of your bitcoins....you are in short, attacking yourself.

all time biggest 24h drop in absolute terms, $3400 and counting. Not even on th 19th of December 2017 had that big of a drop.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:35:22
It actually went all the way down to 17x

Im more curious about his motives for not signing with the genesis block and be done with it...
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:31:47
$3000 before the end of the day?? that is almost a sure thing...

The thing is, why remain anonimous? if he is in jail he has only things to win if he comes comes out of anonimity.

There is a major problem with bitcoin. IF IT IS only you the one who has access to the coins, what happens if you die? you need another person to have access to the coins in case something extreme happens...if not, in the long term, thousands of coins would be lost forever....
And that could happen even if you don't die; major accident, memory loss, coma, etc etc....
A solution would be give half the password of the encrypted privated key to one person, and the other half to another unrelated person, and in case you die, mention that in the will...any other solutions?

That was exactly the point of my comment!!!, well one answer would be that the rest of bitcoins are worth much more...more deflation...
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:12:36
How many people with a considerable amount of bitcoins do you think know of that deadman's switch?.
And having to log in every month "or else" I think it is a bit cumbersome...

"What's biff coin, he asked. Then came that awesome exciting feeling. You know the one I'm talking about."
