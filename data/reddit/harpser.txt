If the US banking system crashes then the whole world will have much much bigger problems to worry about but yes....diversify your savings as you would with bitcoins. Storing some amount of bitcoins on a regulated and licensed exchange does carry some risk but i feel that people nowadays blow it out of proportion.

Yes Venezuela is an edge case along with another handful of countries....but if you put it that way then you can also bring up the handful of exchanges that have also been hacked and claim that they are not secure.

the price may drop tomorrow. buying bitcoin can be thought of like buying stock. can rise or drop at any time. major players can influence the market (support a high, keep prices low, etc). You will most likely fail if you try to time the market. Everyone in this sub has positive outlook on bitcoins but realize that you are asking this in a BIASED community. Its like walking into a league of legends convention and asking everyone if they think league of legends is fun. Im going to take a wild guess and say that most people who are willingly participating in the convention will say yes.

well fargos business practices may not be trustworthy but using that to determine "faith" of a banking institution is like saying i hate the way that restaurants always ask if you want to buy a drink to increase their profit margins so that must mean that i have 0 faith in the food of the restaurant.

point taken, but you arent aiming for just 1 address, you're aiming for any that are valid. so if bitcoins do make it big and millions upon millions of people adopt it, cant people just iterate over word combinations and hope to strike any in a shotgun approach and will have more than a null chance at something? the more the coins end up being worth the more incentive there is..

Can someone explain to me how recovery words actually work? If the 12 or 24 words are my "wallet" why cant i just go around, buy a wallet and start "guessing" 12 or 24 random words until i get one that matches a wallet? Surely there must be something other than those 12/24 words that must be paired so that it equates to your wallet?
