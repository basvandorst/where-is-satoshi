The block chain could serve as distributed long term memory. . . haven't figured out a solution for short term memory . . as for taking actions, well . . . Skynet from the Terminator movies was originally plugged into the military systems, and used them for a first strike. . . I don't know how the Bitcoin Network might lash out . . I hadn't gotten that far in my paranoid fantasy.

It's making more per day than Dicebox, our 4+ star Android app that rolls dice . . . neat segue to the other comment about rolling dice.

I agree, but Neurological and Computer Science AI research says that if you have billions (edit - trillions) of machines rolling dice, the complexity of such a thing would exhibit pattern and intelligence. . . . do a search for "complex systems exhibit intelligence" and you'll get more returned than you would ever have time to read.

There are so many more, but that should be enough to have you eat your retarded comment.

I understand how SHA hashing works.  I also understand the leading edge of AI and Neurological research says that interconnected complexity on its own exhibit forms of 'intelligence' that are not observable in any of the constituting parts.  I also said it was an entertaining thought, something to make one ponder and smile . . . sort of like the whole concept of 'Skynet' to begin with . . .
