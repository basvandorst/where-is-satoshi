Selling on margin before the hack would have locked in the price of bitcoin at the time. The liability would be covered by the new assets. A hedge. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:18:16
Fake. Spreads are fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:15:16
You can tell its bullshit by the invoking of principal component analysis. It's definitely no fingerprint. Like all statistics the output vary with the input and the result is never the same.

Bitcoin is not a product, but a currency to buy products. You should start comparing apples to apples. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:59:06
Ban these fraudsters imo 
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:05:24
It means they inflate the difference between buy and sell price, to give an impression of no fees. In reality this spread is much smaller on the market. Robin Hood scams amateurs by taking in fees through the price difference between spreads on their platform and the market. This model is actually much more expensive than with a flat fee, additionally the cost increases with how much cash you are using. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:35:30
You would not get more no, you would get much less. If real price is 10, you sell for 9, where 1 goes to Robin Hood 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:10:41
Guys this isn't politics, it's technology. Just fix the fees. No arguing.

You've missed a big part of how bitcoin transactions work. Satoshi himself quoted small transactions should be almost free. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:06:20
Interesting to see serious academic work be done on bitcoin. Has any similar attempts been made to price bitcoin? A bitcoin pricing theory?

I had lots of bitcoins as well, roughly 120. I feel nothing. It's like crying over not knowing the lottery numbers the day after. This sounds more like a psychological issue imo.

Or shorts. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:19:18
According to this article, constrainment on the number of transactions puts the fee above zero.
Also, since the supply of bitcoins is limited, you'd expect a price above zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:25:47
You can't be an investor without a calculated forecast based on reasonable assumptions. The only way to price bitcoin is to wait for a bigger fool. Thus, it is gambling. Why not be honest about it? Done it myself. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:05:56

@_date: 2014-10-05 17:43:04
Why do you think traders and whales did this? 
I agree that there currently lacks incentives to buy bitcoin aside from speculation and black market trade. 
When people consider the value of bitcoin, they seem to mix the technology and code with the current instance of bitcoin use. 
Do you really believe Wall Street and the big banks will allow early adopters to hold millions of coins when they are the ones propping up the value? 
In my opinion they will use the technology. There is almost no doubt. But they will use it from scratch.

Debt works fine when everyone plays by the rules. People need debt especially to buy houses. Debt to gamble is bad debt.

Interesting points. I don't follow the Italian situation though. Don't they live at home to an older age though? Perhaps not a real issue, but tiresome to the self having to keep up with your parents for ages.  
@_date: 2014-01-03 06:03:41
No. Central banks increase or decrease money supply to keep the price in check. With bitcoin you will need another solution as its value can not really be controlled once it's really wide spread. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:34:47
Why do some of these addresses keep sending large BTC values to new and new addresses, costing a fortune in fees?
@_date: 2014-10-09 11:55:40
They all look like religion offshoots. You can't control the crowd like this.
There is also a case to be made by keeping things simple.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:46:32
Its good that you disclose who's running it, but a lot of people have run off with bitcoins using methods like these.
@_date: 2014-12-31 16:41:52
This is a huge security boost. Wall Street money will prop up the value.

We can't we just use bitcoin as it is? Silly geeks. mBTC is a huge failure.

@_date: 2014-03-01 15:16:01
The site works fine for me.

Yeah. And if you get a contract to pay 1 bitcoin per month, and the bitcoin price tripples, you'll have to move out. Very useful.

Total value will be the same. Arbitrage rules state there will be no profit from this. A lightning fast few may be able to grab profit as they correct prices. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:42:31
The letter raises many critical points actually.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:12:59
Did I read this correctly? The fork will cause you to get coins in both currencies? 
Market logic states that after the split, total value is the same. If some value is assigned to btu, bitcoin may lose a lot of value on that day. What are the market shares? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:27:54
They have 75% of the coins already? 
@_date: 2018-06-15 05:56:10
Because individual investors have higher transaction costs. Also rebalancing is technical when you have alot of assets. With an index you can just buy and forget. The fee is quite high though.

It's actually cleared within a day before 2 or 3 pm. You're only making payment an encoumberanse and in the long run you'll miss out on interest payments. In a sense, you're paying to use cash. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 17:32:55
Ofcourse not. Bitcoin is the white paper for block chain. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 10:59:50
Block chain is an enormous innovation, and just how big it will get time will tell.

Buy bitcoin is a better trend phrase. Its very low. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:01:07
Well of course the transaction fees are in bitcoin and you have to convert it to dollars at the exchange rate. But what moves the bitcoin price of a transaction is what's interesting.
The price of bitcoin is down about 75% from peak, while the fees are down roughly 91% from peak. You could then perhaps say that the fees are down 16%, roughly. Not that great actually...
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:01:57

Most of what he said has been deleted now, but the whole idea of buying 3 days early is really bad for the customer. I bought at 150 dollars, and when the transaction came through the price was at 260 and quickly crashing before I could even get on mtgox. A better system would be that you deposit money into a site, and buy coins for that at the time of your choosing.
