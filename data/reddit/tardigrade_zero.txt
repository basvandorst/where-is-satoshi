When you are hodling on the streets with your hardware wallet and a half eaten can of cat food you will know that Bitcoin never gives you more than you can handle.

This is how the robot revolution starts.

So if I go to another country, convert currency from USD to Euros and then spend the money and Euros skyrockets the government expects me to pay taxes on the gains between USD and Euros even though I spent it?

That $30 dollars will be worth millions some day kid.

+1 for tangibility, at least I can build a campfire out of my paper bills. Take that bitcoin.

Still enough time for one more rally before Bitcoin becomes boring.

If the price dips way out just say you are a true HODLer, if the price skyrockets sell and you are a master trader, win/win.

Also tax implications, if every transaction is considered a taxable event.

haha.. tried to stay away from getting too political.  Could definitely see a nemesis plotting a 51% attack.

Well the target was 3+ so not a baby technically, kids just enjoy having their parents read to them and having some fun characters though. I've read everything from Tolkien to weird stories about cupcakes to my kid, as long as they are enjoying the story I don't see a negative to them being exposed to technology as well. 
As the disclaimer states you shouldn't expect your kid to learn Blockchain literally, but it doesn't hurt for them to recognize the words/concepts. It's better than watching a YouTube video of toys being unwrapped IMHO.

Reading/hearing stories is a "kids" thing. I've read to my kid every day since they were born.

Looks like my book is getting many bad reviews for not actually teaching blockchain to people.  It was my intention to use blockchain to tell a story, not to teach the subject, but I think this shows that people want to learn about this new tech (awesome for us and for the future). I may do a follow up called "Blocky explains Blockchain" for this audience.
