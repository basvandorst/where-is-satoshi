I feel a bit silly asking this, I've seen this Torch thing mentioned a lot, but what is it exactly? Some kind of Twitter relay? Except what's actually being passed around? What's the torch?

Edit: oh wait, that was exactly what you described, sorry, my bad.
Don't you need to be online to craft a transaction? I imagine one would need to export an xpub to an online wallet to retrieve one's wallet balances, then create a transaction to be copied over and signed offline, before copying back and publishing the final signed transaction?

You should batch your document "proof" with other documents, only one transaction max per block is ever needed for all the timestamps in the universe.
Use opentimestamps.org, it is a free service.
[Edit: fixed typos, but also see  for a demonstration of the batching using Merkle trees.]

Have you seen these before?
Not BTM, but many of the same concerns.
And have you considered whether you'd be running a one-way (buy only or sell only) or two-way (buy &amp; sell) machine?
And, the above list didn't have this, but it was the cheapest possible (only one-way) BTM I have found (but not tried myself - I'm just googling)
