It was COINBASE customer service who told me someone used my credit card on their site. It took some diggingbut when I found the old statements with the last 4 digits of the cc they gave me, I scanned them in and sent it to Coinbase. They confirmed that yes, my card had been used by someone else to buy Bitcoin on their site.

As for my son, he started buying and selling Bitoin last year on his own. He did alot of the local Bitcoin selling thing and at last count, was up to 20 Bitcoin of his own? He was buying and selling for us too but I wanted to learn more so I opened my own account.

I did a chargeback on a fraudulent charge on my credit card. *I* did not defraud Coinbase. Look slike their verification system is flawed.

I did. They said "Because this person used your own financial information, it has also created a type of security hold that also prevents further purchases from completing on your own account." 
The card that was used was not linked to my account (and in fact, was cancelled). If Coinbase did not do a proper verification of this credit card before adding it to this guy's account, that is their fault. But to punish me when I gave them a valid credit card number and a valid bank account...with all identifying information matching up...there should be no reason they cannot reactivate my buy/sell functions.

No, the charges showed up as CBPURCHASE. I had never heard of Coinbase at that point so until I scanned in my CC statements and sent them into Coinbase--where they told me they we in fact, CBPURCHASE. I had no idea back in March who Coinbase even was.  All I saw was this charge on a card that had been sitting in our drawer and hadn't been used in a year. The only reason I knew about the charge was the CC company sent me a statement. And, btw, I have never used a CC to purchase Bitcoin, only bank transfers out of my bank account.

You are right. I found the Coinbase subreddit after I posted. Sorry about that. And Coinbase has placed the hold on my account, not my credit card company. Again, I wasn't even aware that the fraudulent charge on my CC account was Coinbase until today. I think what irks me is they failed to verify some guys info 4 months ago and while I can prove all of my information, they have no interest. Just frustrated. As for local bitcoins, I 'm not paying a premium. My kids all have account and I will have them do the buys for me.
