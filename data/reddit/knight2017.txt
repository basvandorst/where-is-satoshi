the confusion it will bring~

to be honest the trade should be other way around~
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:07:22
All you do is insulting people not thinking through. But the fact is you have no idea what you are talking about.   
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:04:05
How is an audited and FDIC insured coin a garbage?
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:01:08
 but still how can you make it remain pegged to the dollar?
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:35:36
Or that, but nevertheless necessary. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:20:36


Man, you have no idea how things works do you. All you need to explain is what will happen when btc decrease 50% to dallor value. How the peg will remain? Lay it out yourself then you will realize you have no idea what you are talking about. Lolz 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:32:01
Do you use dollar to buy your coffee or bitcoin. What is the population ratio is like? What is adoption in your mind? 
@_date: 2018-09-15 00:27:24
haha, I am popcorn ready!
@_date: 2015-12-01 06:57:18
tho, big block many centralize mining. but to reach mainstream we will eventually need a very big block size anyway. so.... between a rock and hard place now?
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:34:38
It is called legacy world compatibility. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 09:45:36
 you are saying it is not possible to make loans using BTC？ or you are saying there will never be insured safes. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:44:23
Every private key and also the master private key can never leave trezor by design, right?
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:22:04
centralized BTC in the making!!
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:37:17
.somehow i strongly agree to this 100k is the limit without systmatic changes
@_date: 2015-12-30 02:11:10
Are you sure the roadmap will give us tens of thousands txps without any increase and without compromising the network? Would like you provide some evidence on that. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 10:00:18
I thought litcoin has 1MB block size too? But either way I think we will touch the blocksize ceiling very soon. Then bitcoin will be broken. It is possible we will witness a situation where bitcoin crashs in value and an altcoin increases in value.  But if litcoin will be the ultimate runner up is still up for debate.  (I have already started to diversify to Litcoin and Ether.)
@_date: 2015-12-30 03:17:04
From what I have been reading (non-technically),  with the current cap. LN can only support 70mil population. if you think thats enough. who am I to disagree.
@_date: 2015-12-31 20:44:36
Bigger block size may just be the solution to this problem. With bigger block size, more people will join the network and pump the price up, when mining is profitable enough more pool will show up. With current condition, user number is caped, it is not senseable to invest in infrastructures. By the way SW creates more data, how come that is not the problem. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:08:08
You don't even understand the Bitcoin ecosystem. No one will explain to a troll. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:22:26
TUSD was added to exchanges. So what makes your think the FDIC insured asset won't?
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:26:33
Should have best of both worlds, specially when adoption requires acceptance from older world. In the long run, it may not be a  big deal but at current stage it opens flood gates. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:09:06

Can you be sure he isn't banned from here?
@_date: 2015-12-22 05:15:41
you should make this a new thread, let them know that their indecision will render their investment worthless, miners and investers alike.
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:32:19
your only have one argument, Lee did not say it so it is bullshit. This shows how little understanding you have to how the politics work in China. but either way your argument is more pointless than the Survey you claim to be. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 07:29:53
No private keys can leave Trezor. That's probably why they are not concerned. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:53:19
anything has volatility. in case you dont know. subprime crisis tanked almost everthing on the face of the planet. if you think short term price swing is the problem with store of value. then nothing by that standard has ability of storing value.
@_date: 2015-12-14 08:55:56
As dead as can be. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 04:34:35
you are making a perfect example of the ppl you hate. good job
@_date: 2015-12-31 07:09:31
He is just double asking your statement as a argument. Effortless debate. Lol
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:06:05
Only moron like you will pump like that. Who ever do that can't gain anything without the mass adoption there is no place to dump. I do that to make moron like you to be rich. Keep on dreaming.
@_date: 2015-12-19 21:03:22
This is definitively my concern. posting this to bring awareness to the community. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 09:44:07
You have to realize that for the price to go higher there should be more demand. Thus more people need to join the network. But the block size cap limit the bitcoin to have a mass adoption.without this problem resolved, Bitcoin is a very risky investment, because at merely 7 tps, bitcoin is not good for anything. As of now, without a solution to the blocksize limit. The question should not be why the price hasn't take off. The more interesting question should be why the price has not crashed.  some speculate that a big entity is hoarding. But who knows. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:25:33
I don't know how to disagree with this. Seems like not only Bitcoin has the scaling problem for its mass adoption, but it also, against what it stands for, become centralized. If the trend continues BTC will eventually become a private blockchain itself. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 10:15:59
I think some one would say that adding blocks 5x as fast will make the block size grow too big, then there is that whole centralizing mining debate again. 
orphan will be picked up eventually, seems like it has no cost on the whole mining community.
I really have no idea how a blocktime debate will turn out to be. But as of now, It seems like that a hard fork not happening is not due to technical reasons but more to some political agendas. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 09:23:40
block-size debate is like a civil war,
block-time would like a world war,
The next hard fork debate will probably be a star war. lol

I think he is just having mental breakdowns.

@_date: 2015-12-31 07:04:19
Well said sir, well said !!!
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:24:31
Why do you think the price is this low right now?
@_date: 2018-05-17 15:06:36
Shit like quality shit post
@_date: 2015-12-08 06:56:32
Some kids of your age are mastermind of bitcoins now and this is your list of questions.

That 180
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:34:04
Nah, just shit post. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 08:55:08
The day bitcoin is no longer decentralized,  It will fail. And the fact that people starting off with making a centralized ledgers think they will be superior is nothing but a joke.

And FYI, this is right across the street of Ferrari, Lamborghini and Bentley dealerships. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:32:43
The announcement caused no btc dump, so they just want to try again.
@_date: 2018-08-23 05:55:33
you have to be a blind retard to not see the  effect future had on the price. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 07:57:40
this is spam for fake certificates pasted over and over again.

Doge astronaut says so, I believe
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:04:17
this is good example of people have no idea why money has value. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:15:57
they have dumped so much, yet they sti have 200k. Do they have infinit supply at 200k coins?
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:27:41
Or in this case, will never be able to understand.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:06:48
I think credit system will actually be made easier with blockchain.

When there is people try to contribute, core followers treat them like cancer. this is the way now. but the truth is core is the real cancer now. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 16:58:44
The core is making terrific efforts to make this happen. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 03:47:12
shhhh.....you are not allowed to talk about that here. they ban people for saying crazy things. it is like in China if you say one bad thing about that government, you will be deleted from the system.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:08:47
nothing innovative but a slight change cause miles improvement. unlike your comments has absolutly zero value in improving bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:29:34
living in the now and denial. I am sure tomorrow's problem will never bother the simple minded today.
@_date: 2016-01-08 05:03:02
 A couple of people signed a document = consensus for bitcoin  community. Is this serious or a joke ? Only these people signed this is best proof that it is far from consensus.
@_date: 2016-01-02 04:22:54
says the lamb about to be roasted by the core. 
@_date: 2016-01-09 01:37:05
oh Boy 2.5min block time is a centralizing factor. oh boy oh boy.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:21:26
this issue can never be extremely clear. I hope you understand that and there always will be people disagree. if that is what you require for a hard fork. It will NEVER happen.
@_date: 2016-01-07 19:17:14
it is not like we never had a hard fork before. it is not like we never has uncapped limit here. man what is the phobia here. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 05:05:27
Gavin, Thank you!
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:31:38
and bitcoin has non of those centralizing factors?
@_date: 2018-10-31 02:17:47
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:25:30
Dose it matter if it is them? Movement of this kind of amount is always troubling.
@_date: 2018-06-02 02:10:01
Lol, US govt can only bully weak countries. They got no balls to go after China. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:34:34
Wait till last week of the month where BTC future settles. Always a guaranteed dump.
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:35:51
A nice piece
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:10:59
People bought around 8-18 meaning people sold around 8-18.
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:21:12
every future settlement week is a sell off week. Why is this hard for people realize this. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:11:50
damn, I need a time machine.
@_date: 2018-06-04 19:26:27
sad but true
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:26:12
I'd say somewhat encouraging. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:04:22
these just shows how clueless those "big" players are right now. This somehow reminds me the story that when the founders of Google was trying to sell the search engine, one of the ceo they met said, my customers dont need this. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:43:33
I think Bakkt will have its own settlement layer. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:14:44
seems like more and more a real problem as each month goes by.

@_date: 2018-11-27 22:39:34
I read that they plan handle transactions using their network like a sidechain and settle on chain once a day at closing bell.

No jinx, no jinx.

feels likes, it could still be a no go this time. :(
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:55:08
Ain't that the truth.
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:43:28
Increase 5 fold in near term? I dont think so. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 11:55:22
But unlike gold and silver, demands for precious metals is almost fix. But for digital assets demand could be surging at anytime.  And the manipulation will stop work. But for the time being, it seems will take a lot longer. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:49:48
Wait till next btc future settlement day. Price dives. Thank me later.

Only listening to core is going backwards for Bitcoin. The best solution should win the population.

do you know what internet was like seven years in? 
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:52:46
but why?
@_date: 2015-11-26 03:53:15
If btc don't evolve and adapt, it will die. How's that for investment. Fork should come and not just only from core.  Not a xt supporter but I do support the idea core is not the central government of Bitcoin.
