I had to keep shutting down the program and restarting when it acted up. Like three or four times until things work. But it works.

Thanks for the work you put in, man. It started out as a good piece of software. I'm just going to reinstall OS as Ubuntu. I like Gnome but damn is crypto is hobbled on this OS. Everything is developed for Ubuntu. RAM is 8Gb, so no issues there. Cheers

Then what you said was a non-sequitur. I'm looking for the "private keys," a term that has a well-defined and well-known meaning. You can't just say, "Oh the backup string is a kind of private key TOO," because it is not. It just reveals that you aren't really familiar with the terminology yet.

Yeah, thanks but I've been there already. See the reply that says, "Unfortunately, (it seems to me) neither the Armory paper backup nor the Export Keys does not contain the private key (only the Root key is shown)"
Looks like I'm not the only one to have this problem. The private keys just don't come out. There seems to be some confusion of private keys with root keys going on. I want the private keys.

Literally afraid to update my Windows copy now. Will it still be able to give me my private keys if I leave it at 1.35 and download the full blockchain to it?

I think I may have a clue - it's possible that the wallet doesn't know what addresses it has until the blockchain is synced. It sounds unintuitive, but Bitcoin is unintuitive, so this could be a thing. My Debian machine has enough space on the HDD, but Armory is missing text in the interface, and when I installed in Debian and started up, I got a message that said that it was unable to create the DB, so I'm going to see if I can figure out what that means. I guess the process for installing dependencies for Armory may not be that thorough yet - the devs might have missed one or two. Will continue to check.

Because I don't have the empty space on the drive to download the whole blockchain right now. I'll have to buy an external HDD and move as much as I can over to that in order to do this. And I'm irritated because, yes this is free software, but this should be one of the easiest features to implement reliably, and the software has been out for years now.

I don't know. But I just reinstalled the OS specifically because they have builds for Ubuntu and all the instructions for installation are for Ubuntu. Guess what? The .deb file does not install on Ubuntu. You click it and it opens in the software center (they made me give them my email for the privilege of using it too, since when does that happen in Linux?) and then there is a button that says "install." You click it, and BAM. Nothing at all. It's just a dead button.

No it's not. Armory's backup string is Armory's backup string. Can't import it into other wallets.
