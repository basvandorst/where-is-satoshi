Hey man, thanks for the app suggestion. Electrum said it would land within 25 blocks, but when I inspect the transaction, its fee is set to 100 satoshi/byte. The app makes sense, until you go lower than 250 satoshi/byte. Below that, and all the way down to 0 satoshi/byte it says 166 hours for everything.
It's been over 24 hours. It looks like [this]( in Electrum wallet. When I right click, I get the option to increase the fee, but I'm completely out of btc because I sent everything. It doesn't say anything about confirmations, so I'm assuming it doesn't even have one.
Is there anything I can do? Do you know of some way to get a small amount of btc online besides purchasing more?  I can't buy more coin until Monday, and I kinda need this transaction to land Sunday night at the latest.

The fee is set to 0.001 btc/kb (100 satoshi/byte I think), which Electrum said would land "within 25 blocks", but it's been over 24 hours. It looks like [this]( in Electrum wallet.
