I just started mining bitcoins and even if you don't have free electricity you profit by keeping yourself warm during winters and as a linux fan I don't play games and mining bitcoins is perfect alternative. Bitcoins are the first currency that thought me something about money.  Also, it's more of a hobby.

**Bitcoins** are like minerals. gold, diamonds... It's like we have just found a new type of diamond and now our computers are mining them. 
**It's a mineral and a currency at the same time.**
What's the use of a diamond? It's only expensive because it's shiny and rare. It has some value in production but it's irrelevant.
It's even far more better than diamond. It has a power to create a **stable currency**.

Visa charged me 10 euros on 1 euro transaction the other day for verifying with Coinbase... and that was no error. So even when everything is normal the transactions are always overcharged.

Losing 0.4 BTC right now will be profitable in future if it teaches me not to gamble again.. And I think it did :p

But I'm still in a good mood.

How can I do that? I have bitcoin-qt on linux.

so if they stay unconfirmed, they are returned to wallet or lost? thx.

I was feeling reckless because it's such a small amount and mining is more of a hobby for me at least for now.
EDIT: 1 year of mining would give me 12 BTC if ASICs don't arrive... and they will

Thanks. I found Bitcointoss but I'm getting error message.




Will try Satoshi then'
@_date: 2013-02-08 17:20:08
but when can I use them again? because now they are waiting for a confirmation and they are not in my balance.
@_date: 2013-01-10 21:43:43
wat? how is that even possible?

I have a small bedroom and I spend 95% of the time in it when I'm at home so that is the only place that needs to be heated and I didn't turn on my air conditioner this whole winter so my electricity bill is even lower.
