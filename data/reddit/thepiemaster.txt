You can't defend bitcoin's wanton energy use as "At least it's not as bad as..."
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:19:17
Have you found any way to quantify that amount of power vs the current electricity to verify transactions? And isn't the power consumption of bitcoin only going to increase the more complex the blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:55:48
And no, it's not someone's fault for not using 2FA just as it isn't a burglary victims fault for being robbed after not locking doors. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:33:43
Now watch this post get silenced. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:59:59
You should post it and get yourself the credibility. Anti-btc posts are being down voted, users want their project to be only praised. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:30:19
No to the first, my password wasn't guessable, what probably happened was password reuse on other sites, and one of them is selling the passwords. But even if it wasn't "secure enough" it's still stolen money and he should be found if possible.
Probably yes to the second, but that just means he's more prosecutable.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:54:02
They're not liable due to fraud? How is that relevant? They should WANT to go after criminals, or their platform is going to be complicit and get shut down. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:21:23
Just letting you know  that you're right, and there are still people who care and are fighting, but you're in enemy territory right now so you're going to get downvoted. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:32:21
Probably mathematically cannot, or probably just won't bother? Because the more people filing complaints the harder the government regulation will be of coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:36:38
Right, they care about the environment! Lol! Bunch of hippies 
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:28:00
So weird how this post gets downvoted! Not like bitcoiners are biased!
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:13:50
Inflation rates won't give you the waste. The inflation rate of 2% is set through monetary policy. They could make deflation if they wanted to contract, which wouldn't mean they've had negative waste.

I'm not disagreeing with you that conventional currency uses a hellava lot of energy too, maybe even more than Bitcoin.
But how do you get the "6x more" figure? The energy index puts bitcoin at 44,020 GWh/yr or 120.6 GWh/ day, compared with your 2GWh for the vans. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:37:19
Bitcoin used by criminals?? No way! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:42:43
Of course they shouldn't reimburse it themselves, but they could take back the coin from the thief's wallet and close their account, right?
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:25:45
She's communicating her thoughts on a serious issue, it's worth the infitesimal amount of energy. You're advocating for the use of a financial system that **uses the same amount of energy for every transaction as a house does in a week.** 
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:40:48
Then coinbase is complicit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:56:50
Thank you. "L0l, tax evasion!"
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:26:08
It's a scam. You can't cash out. If you read the reviews they are either 5s for people who haven't tried cashing out yet or 1s for those who have. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:30:00
Right. You need to have 500,000S ($74) to cash out, I'm worried that a nefarious designer would make it harder and harder to earn S the closer you get to 500K, then just make it literally impossible at 499K, so I wanted other's experience. I'll report back if I cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:19:51
"Taxed", but how could they enforce it when bitcoin wallets are anonymous? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:22:50
 Thanks! I thought it was an acronym for Hold on for Deer Life. Because when btc stabilizes we're pooling it all and spending it to open a wildlife sanctuary. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:22:22
Just remember, hold on for deer life. It's not about you. The deer need us.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:07:14
Right but isn't the idea to eventually remove ourselves from fiat? So then you end up with an anonymous economy, with no regulation. Except with no regulation on buying/selling/earning, no taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:59:16
Great, so when nobody uses government currency anymore, and nobody is paying taxes (suuuuuuure you will) , who's going to pay for infrastructure? 
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:28:22
What did he say? It was deleted. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:27:42
I think any negative bitcoin news is being deleted or downvoted in order to keep up the hype and prop up the price. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:31:11
Lol, spot on. And then the next big game gets released, players jump ship and all our gems are worthless XD
@_date: 2019-11-26 14:43:28
Imagine you had an asset whose value depended solely on others purchasing the same. They buy, you win. They sell, you lose. 
Wouldn't you spread the meme of "Buy! Buy! Buy!" "To the mooon!" "HODL!!"
You're in the reddit-equivalent of a time-share meeting right now. I'm the guy in the back trying to disillusion everyone, and who is soon to be escorted out.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:32:15
Let me know if I'm getting this. People are buying bitcoin as an investment, right? They think their value will increase or at least stay the same. And as more people want them they do get a bump in their bitcoin percieved value. 
So the reward structure is a pyramid, with the first owners owning all the increase in value that the later buyers put in, later buyers owning the value of what comes after them, etc. (Let me know if you agree here or not.)
The value in the bitcoin system comes from having people inject their value into the system by buying it or wanting to buy it with other currencies. 
More people buying it / wanting it = more value. 
Normal investments work by using that value to make more value, like a seed growing into a fruit or a factory making shoes. But money in bitcoin isn't being used as investment, nobody is buying factories or farms in bitcoin, it's just being held or bought or sold, so it isn't generating more value.
Eventually, people are going to want their 'investment' back to buy cars and houses, and ask for the increased price. But there won't be more value in the system than what's been put in. The price will   then plummet and all the perceived value will vanish.

Fake news? How about [the WIRED article?]( 
Do you not think mining bitcoins is wasting energy?
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:56:49
Oxygen is renewable. Most of our energy comes from non-renewables.
@_date: 2019-04-12 16:38:24
Bitcoin itself is a waste of energy. It serves no purpose other than tax fraud and obscuring criminal transactions, and that isn't worth 1% of our energy production.
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:54:07
Yes, if all of life is about making Bitcoin. It's a waste of energy on the global scale.
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:55:25
How about WIRED?  [ 
How about using your common sense?
@_date: 2019-04-10 22:54:45
Just because there exist worse things doesn't make what we are doing good.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:42:58
People will still buy some for buying drugs and counterfeits online but that's about it.
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:30:58
OK, 2 years.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:25:36
I'm not patient enough for that. Do you not think it will increase in value soon? We could make it a year if you'd rather. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:47:40
How much are you buying at $3k?
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:44:32
Risk-free? This is my only (8-year-old) account and I know how pointy Reddit's pitchforks are.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:28:51
How about this, Bitcoin is currently  $4432.  I think it will drop. In one month, I'll pay you whatever the gain is. If it goes up to 5432, you make $1000. But if it drops, you pay me the loss. Deal?
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:05:48
Would you like to prove you trust bitcoin and make the bet or no?
