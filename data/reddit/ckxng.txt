It all depends on the application model.  JavaScript apps have more caching potential than traditional webapps, because all the static content is actually cacheable.  Traditional forums are almost completely uncacheable, because your username/who is logged in/unread messages display on every page.
API calls could be an issue, but again it depends on the implementation.  The app has to do that processing anyway, so it's not a CPU issue.  And calls could be combined, so it's not a number of requests issue.  JSON is generally smaller than formatted HTML.  And actually GET API calls are generally more cacheable than formatted HTML anyway (because it doesn't necessarily include user-specific data).
But to your point JavaScript is "hip" right now, and there's a lot of temptation to do stupid, performance-killing things with it.
So it ALL depends on how well architected the app is.  That's my unsolicited two cents, anyway.

I agree.  Presumably there is *someone* who reviews and accepts applications.  Surely they're aware of the nature of MMM's activities.
I suspect that the risk is low though.  Where's the news story?  "Bitcoins help ponzi scheme dodge taxes?"  Bitcoin gets enough weird press as it is, that I doubt MMM makes much of a difference in the long run, and every group that stands behind Bitcoin is a nudge towards legitimacy.

He reminds me of myself at that age.  I hope you continue to encourage him to think for himself, even when it is easier to adopt the more popular opinion.
