Really? $2,000 can be confirmed in 2 minutes? Thats crazy if its true.. September 2016 i did my firts bitcoin transfer and it was about 30 minutes wasnt bad the wait slowly getting higher and higher the wait time till now 8 hours... 
If i can transfer in 3 minutes with litecoin that would be great!!!!

He bought bitcoin when it was not even close to current levels, he was an early investor, looks like he getting ready to dump

Btc-e and okcoin when it was announced that they cant accept USD anymore they both traded close to bitfinex price. They now both have gone back to their normal prices, but bitfinex has not

US banks hate bitcoin business, any news of a bust on the largest exhange of bitcoin is more reason for them to hate bitcoin business that are not regulated

I am having this same problem i been waiting almost 8 hours!!!!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-04-23 03:35:57
So the people in BTC-E and Okcoin are not leaving the exhange buying bitcoim to transfer else where cause of the USD problem they have?

Bitcoin price got pump up the same day the ETF was going to get denied and hit new record high in almost all exchanges over $1320 when it was actually going down for 3 days... Insiders moved the price up and exactly at 4PM when the news came out they dropped it and everyone panic sell when it was later discovered the ETF was denied and the price dropped in minutes to the 900s.... It was supposed to be announced on the SEC website for everyone to see at the same time, but yet it was pump up to record highs hours before everyone knew the actual decision... In less than a sec turning 4PM EST bitcoin price at its high pump dropped... who was able to read the decision in less than a second???  BITFINEX can easily manipulate prices cause everyone sees them as the biggest volume exchange just as China was once the biggest volume and everyone follow them till the government stop all those robot trading to stop these high up movements... These high up movements so fast are not healthy for bitcoin especially if the fundamentals behind it right now are not very good at the moment.

Okcoin is now lower than Gdax it has actually also fixed its price... so the question is why is bitfinex still so high?

I am from a country that i do buy bitcoin cause i need it to bypass currency controls. I dont buy bitcoins like everyone else does to just invest in it and wait for it to go up in value. I buy bitcoins to transfer them to a debit card that allows me to buy things online that i cant do with my countries currency. 
Right now i am so pissed off that i been waiting for 8 hours for coinbase to confirm my transaction so i can purchase some stuff i need with my debit card.
This is really getting really bad cause i buy and transfer all the time and now i have to put in my head that if i need to buy something i must prepare to waste half of the day just for me to do so.
What is an altcoin that will transfer right away and not take as long as bitcoin??? I dont think i will be using bitcoin anymore if i can find a faster coin.
Thank you

Even if bitfinex is able to find a bank to work with them most people will sell to collect the profits pushing its price down... Either way this is not  healthy for the ecosystem from what we are seeing today other banks might want to stop doing business with other exhanges if Bitfinex does goes bust.. Bitfinex is something we cant ignore
@_date: 2017-04-23 05:53:40
You can still put on bitfinex an order to withdrawal....  you should research online about BTC-E USD problems so you can be more informed

How fast litecoin transfers? I am waiting normally now on my transfers on bitcoin anywhere from 2 hours to 8 hours depending the size of it... how long does litecoin takes?

Not looking good
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:41:19
Everytime bitfinex moves up the others follow... but i have seen that now gdax, bitstamp, kraken that are really big volume exhanges are now slowly limiting the up moves even if bitfinex moves 20 points in minutes... this wasnt the case last two weeks before all of this happened... bitfinex moved 20 points in minutes and everyone followed... so the current price of bitcoin has to do alot because of bitfinex, now that we know what is happening they have slowly stopped following them as they did before and this is why the gap is getting bigger.
@_date: 2017-04-23 00:49:35
This is good for now, but when bitfinex crashes as we all know bitcoins price is not what they are reporting everyone else is also going to fall. Just look at the daily graph in bitfinex is not looking healthy as time passes

I have a visa debit card attached to coinbase that lets me use the bitcoins online.. so i have to use coinbase unless i find another company that has a debit card

"BTC-E, one of the oldest bitcoin exchanges, has suspended USD withdrawals until the end of the month. The company is looking for a new banking partner but hopes to have everything resolved in the coming weeks."
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:18:59
The same way all the exhanges followed Bitfinex before the news on this rally, same thing is going to happen if they fall cause this recent price movement on bitcoin was started by them... time will tell if we are more resilient now... history tends to always repeat it self

If Zero-day old Reddit accounts can manipulate the price... that tells me everything I needed to know about why Bitcoin been going up 140 points on average for 3 weeks with so bad fundamentals... its very easy to manipulate :)

I am all in for bitcoin to go high in price, but bitcoin will not catch on like wildfire right now cause is mostly a trade game. Some countries like Venezuela need bitcoin, but yet a lot of them are complaining that it takes 4 or even 9 hours to confirm a transaction as they move it to another exchange to convert it to dollars... 
@_date: 2017-04-23 01:05:08
Bitfinex first reported officially there was a delay in USD withdrawal on April 13 but also saying Taiwan had some holidays causing delays.
But some users where reporting problems the first week of april of delays online. People have been buying bitcoins to get out of that exhange before the firts official news. Bitfinex since the first week of April have been higher than any other exhange and everyone else was just following not knowing what was happening.

Yes its very responsive to news, but not right now is not. I been trading for a very long time, but these recent small downwards spikes are normal technical drops nothing else. The Bitfinex exchange two weeks ago and still today been getting pump with millions of dollars every time the price tried to fall because other exchanges were going down. Bitfinex had and still have way to much power on the price and they know this.
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:44:13
Btc-e, okcoin and others have problems with the USD but none of them have a spread as high and actually BTC-E is now lower than other exhanges... Something is not feeling right... 
Bitstamp is now 125 spread compare to Bitfinex.. its getting worse
Update: Okcoin affected also with the USD problem is now trading lower than Gdax fixing its high price

I been using bitcoin since september 2016, i learned alot about it cause i can transfer money out of my country easy now where we have currency controls, but its now taking wayyyy to long to transfer bitcoin. I have not used other alt coins so before i do i wanted to see what was the fastest one...
Litecoin or ETH is what i might be thinking of trying that dont scare me as much as others, i dont buy to invest just to move money out of my country and buy online or transfer it to my bank account abroad

Normal comments from ignorant americans that most likely cant even find his country in a map, not sure how he even knew he was in the northern hemisphere must have gone to wikipidia most likely.
