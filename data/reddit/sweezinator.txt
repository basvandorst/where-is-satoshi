Will lightning bring down transaction processing times too?

I bought in at 7800 and felt the same way when it crashed to 5600. Your time will come.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:41:03
I'd say its bottom is somewhere in the 12k range

It belongs in the JPMorgan gaming forums
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:23:20
I'd say under 16k is a good time to buy

Welcome to the hotel California

from what I've seen they either crash as well or don't move.

So if you live in Korea you could buy bitcoin on GDAX and sell it on bithumb?

Since the price just spiked, you could wait for a least a minor dip before buying if you want. I wouldn't wait more than a day or 2 if I was you, I waited a day before buying and lost out a bit (but that was weeks ago so nbd in the end)
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:17
I think the plan was just bcash

It's the coin exchange that coinbase uses

dips happen pretty often, I would say the next dip would go down to about 11,800 but that's just a wild guess. bigger dips like the one you mentioned happen like once a month.

That's not how statistics works. If the odds of the other case being the 1 million is 50/50, then that would mean other cases odds of being correct are also 50/50. The 1/26 thing would only matter if you picked your case, then howie opened 24 cases that weren't the 1 million, knowing what he was doing and not randomly guessing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:55:58
Of course, and I brought more bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-20 01:25:52
I don't even bother looking at graphs or getting alerts, I just see what memes are on this subreddit to see if the price went up or down.
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:47:03
Same, we gonna be alright though 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:05:36
There will probably be a dip at 10k, but it's probably good to remember that the 10k barrier only matters to people that use USD
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:23:31
The only reason I didn't dump at 9000 was because coinbase wasn't working. Thank God.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:24:35
I mean one issue BCH has is you can't even really buy it with USD
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:53:00
But they failed! As they were stricken down to the ground!
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:22:31
Pump and dump?
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:12:41
ahh, the classic dump and pump.
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:35:27
I was there a couple weeks ago and can confirm, I recognize the logo even though I was at a different course.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:21:57
What would happen to bitcoin if sha256 becomes as broken as sha1?
