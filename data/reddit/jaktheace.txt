What a foolish thing to say. The U.S. is a country ruled by law, and it is hardly insane. As every country does, especially one with 300 million people and more diversity than you can shake a stick at, we have laws that are unjust and problems with our society. The only reason people don't judge the shit out of your country all the time is because it isn't under a microscope internationally like the U.S..

People aren't just envious of the fun, they're envious of the exposure. Doge got a huge ROI for that $50,000, and bitcoin would have too.
For $50,000,(the equivalent of each user in this subreddit donating fifty cents), dogecoin was seen by 5 *million* people in an unquestionably legitimate setting, and given respect by announcers. It was mentioned on twitter and facebook by NASCAR itself, lending even more exposure and legitimacy to millions. On top of that it's gotten shit tons of exposure on Reddit today, reaching an audience of *tens of millions* in an extremely positive light. The idea that bitcoin would not have benefited from a similar arangement, even if the tone was different, is kind of absurd.

Did you ever get your bitcoin out? That is a shitload of money.

No one is disputing the benefits, of which there are many, but just because something has good qualities does not mean it can't also have negative ones. Unfortunately, those negative qualities are huge barriers to mainstream adoption and use.

The other problem is that the price inflates and deflates rapidly, if you are speculating, this might be a good thing. If you actually want to use bitcoin as money or a store of value, it appears extremely volatile and unsafe, which it is. Hopefully it can get to stability one day, but bitcoins biggest strength can also be it's biggest weakness; It's hard to get things done when there's no central authority.

lol your bar is pretty low.

Doesn't matter. The exposure and legitimization for cryptocurrency that occurred as a result of this was worth so, so much more than $50,000.
And while plenty of stupid people watch NASCAR, there are a ton of very intelligent and savvy people who watch it as well, and you are seriously generalizing if you think otherwise.

Everything BIPSbitcoin said here is true, but as a small business, none of these things should concern you as much as your cash flow. Accepting bitcoin will SLOW DOWN your cash flow. You will have to take time and effort to sell the bitcoins. More importantly, if the bitcoin market crashes, as it has done before and will do again, you could be forced to sell your bitcoins at a serious loss just to meet your cashflow obligations. I think bitcoin can be a great thing for big business, but I personally do not think it is stable enough for a small business to depend on.
However, it would only affect your cashflow if you think customers would start using bitcoin *instead* of other payment methods, so it would also depend on what kind of business you operate. If you believe accepting bitcoin could expand your customer base significantly, or if you know there are a significant number of people who would only purchase from you if you accepted bitcoin, then it could be worth even with less timely cash flow. 
People here are extremely pro-bitcoin, as I am myself, so many of them only see the positives, but a business taking bitcoin into consideration HAS to take into account what that could do to their cashflow. Even successful large businesses can take serious hits or fail if they are unable to meet their cashflow obligations. We can all hope that one day bitcoin becomes truly mainstream, and even your suppliers would accept it, eliminating any cashflow concerns, but that day has not yet come.

I do investment banking work as well, and I can tell you bitcoin just isn't on the radar. The brokers and portfolio managers I know who are even aware of bitcoin realize it is simply too uncertain to recommend to clients.

There are 86400 seconds in a day, and 3 years over 227 is about 1/75, compared to 1/86400. So, while it is a crude comparison, traditional markets grew 1141 times faster than bitcoin.

Who cares? That's one of the beauties of bitcoin, you can use it as you see fit. You can't be mad at people for not sharing your ideology. You should be happy you helped them make a good investment.

I find it strange that people who are into bitcoins and the freedom they provide would be interested in the closed "you can do what we let you" platform of the iphone. Their competitors have more advanced phones and competitive operating systems.

That's not really something to be worried about though, miners still get btc for each block too, yes? We're still a long way from being mined-out, and the desirability of mining will go up and down with the price of bitcoin. Eventually as bitcoins prices go up mining will become more worthwhile.
