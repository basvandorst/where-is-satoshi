I really don’t get it. No upside for the user. Pay for the card, pay for fees, and paying taxes on gains would be a nightmare. what’s the point? No cash back. No benefits and still just using a Visa card.

Yes just need a usb to mSATA adapter. Yes you can use without screen. Just find the ip of the pi and ssh into it.

Literally sign anything with an early private key and make it public... I’ll believe him and BSV will still be a shitcoin.

It could be 51%ed and people would still buy it. Look at ETC. people are dumb AF.

How? Pull out to fiat once. pay a coinbase fee once. be taxed once.

When you realize price isn’t the most important aspect... you will understand.

I would recommend to buy a small amount to just play around with. download a few wallets on your phone and on your pc and move small amounts of coins around and get a feel for how the network works maybe pick up a hardware wallet. Read a lot. Then when you feel comfortable with everything, decide if it’s something you think is worth getting into. If you decide to put more than a few hundred into btc, then definitely start looking at hardware wallets and running a node.

I think the community has decided to use  “Satoshi” for the unit. (0.00000001 BTC = 1 SAT)

For just buying and hodl cash app is superior to even coinbase pro. Set a limit buy just below market for 0 fees compare that to just buying on cash app. Almost always a better deal with cash app. And you can instantly buy and withdraw. No need to wait for payments to clear. If you want to trade that’s a different animal, but for dollar cost averaging cash app is the way to go.
