What exactly do you mean by this? Private patronage seems like it'd work better under traditional currencies because donations can be traced and written off on tax forms. How do you see digital/cryptocurrencies changing the landscape of patronage?

Never purchase anything whose spokesman can't afford a tailored suit.  If they had a proper service, he'd be able to afford a jacket that's fitted properly.

Where does that money come from? Am I paying to be connected to your network as an end-user or what?

On the other hand, when you have thirty thousand people a minute trying to edit Kevin Bacon's page with "In 1989 KeviKEVIN BACON IS A QUEER" even with all the security measures only possible under that centralised authority, you've got to wonder how wild vandals would go if we went Mad Max.

Reddit turns into a pit of vultures the moment you mention money. I made some comment a year or two ago about my childhood and woke up to some 400 PMs either begging for money, telling me to kill myself for having money, or prostituting themselves out for scraps. 
It's best to avoid the site for a week or so. Otherwise whatever faith you still hold in humanity is going to be shredded. Especially when they start whoring out their kids as part of their sob story.

I love that we live in an era where we can say words like cryptoanarchist and cypherpunk with a straight face and be referring to millionaires.

Huh. I always figured it was a far-fetched play on Ft. Knox with some sort of technophile meaning.

Well Bhutan's nearest neighbours are Burma (decades-long civil war), Tibet (decades-long oppression), India (epidemic poverty, the national sport is gang rape), China (it's China), and if you stretch out the definition of neighbour you also get all the countries decimated in the Vietnam War on one side and Afghanistan/Pakistan on the other.
Correlation isn't causation, but there's a lot of happy in Bhutan and a lot of sad everywhere surrounding it.

The moment they captured DPR and several replacement markets came online, I warned everyone I knew even remotely interested in drugs that any new drug market on TOR was probably a honeypot and anything connected to SR was absolutely one. 
They may be relics of another age, but the FBI and DEA aren't idiots. When they got DPR's computer, they had access to all of the internal workings of Silk Road and god knows how many people infiltrating its replacements. He wasn't the last, these three won't be, it's a really bad time to be buying or selling drugs online and those who do should presume that they're being monitored by multiple agencies tracking multiple crimes.

Which is precisely why I made off like a bandit with this. 
I follow as a sort of consolidated news feed for cryptocurrencies without all the meme  bullshit. For the past few weeks, you had a lot of people blindly applying their market philosophies to show New Economy-style eternal growth. I don't think I saw a single post focusing on analysing the traders themselves, only vague examples of times it's happened in the past without concern for the circumstances behind those meteoric rises.
My entire philosophy was thinking of it like a chess game against someone who's never played chess but started out with three queens and his pawns replaced by knights. Basically the whole thing boils down to a market in the hands of lottery winners who have little or no background in trading half-assedly following a few news stories to form their opinion of something they don't understand, myself included.
If you think like that and you constantly apply "Would I panic? Would this raise my confidence? Is this where I'd sell out and be happy with $X instead of $XXX?", there's a hell of a lot of money to be made. The beauty of the information age isn't that it gives us a million new statistics to play with, it's that it lowers the barrier between my mind and your mind enough that someone clever enough can see the world through the eyes of others.

To be fair, most of that population growth is in countries which are either highly unstable or have serious infrastructure deficits that will cripple them when shit hits the fan. [Look at the countries ranked by population]( China's a parody of the industrial revolution, India is a superbug waiting to happen, the US has a failing welfare system and is polarising its castes more and more with every decade, Indonesian history is nightmarish and [that recent documentary]( showed their vice president speaking in praise of their version of Hitler Youth, Brazil is Brazil, Pakistan will blow itself up if India and the US don't do so first, Nigeria is Nigeria, Bangladesh has a history on par with Indonesia, Russia is a despotic hellhole with Soviet-era infrastructure, it's not until number 10 with Japan that you have a real shot at stability (oh wait, they've stopped breeding) and even then the next countries in line are Mexico, the Philippines, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and Egypt before Germany is overshadowed by Iran, Turkey, and the fucking Congo. 
Bubbles only look stable until they don't.

You could say the same for traditional currencies. The difference between the amount of money which crosses the desks of daytraders in a week and that which is donated to charity in a year must be the fortune of a hundred lifetimes. I cashed out because I can do more good with the USD than I can the BTC and with the money I make reinvested under LTC I'm going to have enough to do a lot of good for a lot of animals with my portfolio diversified enough that if any of it pays off I'll be able to do it all over again.
Speculation isn't the evil that people make it out to be. When I turned $30 into almost $30.000, that multiplied the potential of whatever altruism I decide to undertake.
