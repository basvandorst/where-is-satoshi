Did they just open a case and get it sorted via that? I tried to find a customer service number but they only have an American one (I'm in the UK). Hopefully, you have better luck than me.

They still haven't gotten back to me, I opened a new case to which they responded asking for more info. (I think it was an automatic response, as my message to them had all the info in it that they would need). 
I'm not sure what else I can do. :/

Hi, they didn't ask me for any more information. They knew the date of the transfer as I had said in my message it had happened the same day, and they knew what reference number it could be from my list of 5. They just said they would look into it. I've emailed them 3-4 times since then asking for an update and had no response. I'm still hopeful and will wait till after new years to email/call them again as this time of year can be quite busy. 
Still not heard back, will update if and when I do.

Only a few pounds is a fine response. I usually laugh and say "Not enough" when asked.

Oh I see! Thanks for the info,  I just joined in August so only vaguely knew how "hodl" came to be
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:56:22
Not yet. I know how you feel, just keep emailing them. I'm going to open another case I think.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:18:49
But you cry when you think about it right? me too :P 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:00:13
It means hold. As in, hold on to your bitcoin, don't sell. 
hodl stands for Hold On for Dear Life. 
I read another post that said hodl was a reddit users typo that stuck

May I ask how you become a target for everyone? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:14:58

I usually watch it from watch-series.is, you can stream it from there a few hours after it airs in America.

I got 0.2 more litecoin from buying/selling but haven't had a chance to buy more bitcoin because I can't access coinbase to add funds :'(

I'm from Scotland and I use Coinbase. Once you get used to that you can use GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:57:19
Even higher after the episode airs though
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:34:56
could be cryptography instead of cryptocurrency

I've seen some bad reviews of it online, seems like a scammy website.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:26:24
I was just about to go to sleep and checked gdax just in time to see it hit 10k live! :D 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:09:45
Thanks for the advice :D 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:54:02

I got my money back btw. I contacted my bank and they requested the money be returned... a few weeks later, instead of returning it, Coinbase sent the money to my  Coinbase account. Result :D
