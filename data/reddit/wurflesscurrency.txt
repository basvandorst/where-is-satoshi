Bitcoin was around $9,000 when he said that...  Why is this a lol?  He was right.

What are the chances we see a drop as furloughed US government employees start selling their Bitcoin savings to pay for basic needs?
@_date: 2019-01-16 17:07:30
Maybe. In a positive or negative way is the real question.

How is there supposed to be mass adoption if you can't let people know you hold Bitcoin?  You are supposed to conceal all purchases after making them in secret?

Ok, so now that we've had 13 months of declines it is more likely to go up because that is the magic number?  Why wasn't it at 8 months or 11 months?  Why now?  
You're putting far too much focus on the emotional reasoning behind a trade and not looking at its actual value, but I guess that could make sense for something that is entirely speculative in nature.
By your reasoning beanie babies should have bounced back years ago.

But he was right. Bitcoin's nose dive has continued since he said that.

Soooo, he was right?

Total market cap?  I expect it to go lower, but not that low. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 17:22:29
How is that logic? The trend is your friend. It says otherwise.

Lol, that is a pretty low bar to set. 50% down for the year would be more of a positive note than 2018. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 02:37:45
We haven't even seen real capitulation followed by huge margin calls yet.  Just because it has already gone down 80% doesn't mean it can't easily go down another 80%. You must be new to this investing thing.  There is no intrinsic or book value to backstop a continued plummet this time.

Such bullish news for Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2019-01-17 16:05:30
What are you basing your assumption on?  Why is it more likely?
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:30:55
Are you out of your mind?  The stock market just fell below even for the year and Bitcoin is down nearly 80%.
