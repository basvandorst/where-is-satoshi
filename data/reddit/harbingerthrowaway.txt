Set up a DAC using BitsharesX; has all the infrastructure you need ready to go.
Can also pay in bitUSD instead of BTC.

Already done - look into Bitshares and the TITAN protocol.
I've been using the platform for about four months and it is awesome.
Transactions sent to a name (literally - send money to 'BillyBob' and it goes) that confirm in 5-10s. It's everything bitcoin transactions should be.

Have you looked into using a DAC and the Bitshares/DPOS toolkit?

One of the most influential and wealthy tech figures in the world endorses Bitcoin without qualification.
Checks price.

Decentralizing Wall Street?
What a joke!
Patrick wants to 'own' his decentralized exchange and profit from it?
Can someone explain how anything with a single owner is even remotely decentralized?
TL;DR Overstock want to use new tech to recreate old system and profit.

Too much good news that was actually good news.

Yea, no.
Fiat to crypto is always going to have go through a centralized gateway, no way to decentralize fiat transactions.
Once value has been transferred to crypto Bitshares is the answer.
Love how people keep thinking Proof of Work is decentralized, with all of three or four miners controlling the entire ecosystem. BTC couldn't be further from decentralized... 
The Proof of Stake mechanism used by Bitshares is a practical solution to the problem of decentralization. There is no way to completely decentralize anything humans need to interact with. Bitshares recognizes this and has created a viable solution.
I'm not a fanboy, just have done my research. And I have been involved in Bitcoin since 2012. Bitcoin will never die, and it will be adopted by TPTB/govs/big business precisely because it is so centralized. I still believe in the $100k bitcoin. 
But, and I say this having researched, held, contributed or donated to every crypto platform of significance, Bitshares is the way forward. If I had to bet on which crypto will change the world, I would bet on Bitshares.
And yes, I put my money where my mouth is. I hold both BTC and BTS.
Cheers!
