Name a company and you will hear people saying it's bad. This is insurance so when yet another bitcoin company steals everyone's money everyone in can pretend it's no big deal because everyone knew THAT company would steal the money. (but it applies to every company)

Yes, and I as a scammer can make sure all the coins I send them are already in a zero conf state and unlikely to ever confirm. They don't get to pick what coins I send them.

Looks like you are already into trading Magic the gathering online so you are in the right place!

Okay, then, can you answer the question "how many bitcoins need to be pre-confirmed on the blockchain" if 5 people send 5 bitcoin through 5 nodes? Or is that question just going to bring up more riddles? 
How is anyone supposed to even use Lightning networks if literally no one including the developers can answer simple questions about how it even might work!?

I would say most "people who understand the money supply in general" absolutely are not pro Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-10-04 20:13:11
But CAN be used at all the thousands of services that had people lie to them and tell them unconfirmed transactions were safe over the years. 
@_date: 2015-10-03 13:12:57
None of that made it simpler. I still have no idea if it's five or one hundred twenty five given my question.

And with Bitcoin out of network ATMs won't give you cash at any price!

It says "switch to a digital currency" not Bitcoin. Remember that Cryptocurrency is the big deal in r/Bitcoin but that other digital money exists and a bunch of centralized currencies are still currently more popular than Bitcoin.

There has only be 80 million bitcoin transactions ever since the start of the universe.

Spending their money to buy our devalued junk doesn't empower anyone or beat oppression, it just makes us slightly richer and them vastly poorer.

You gambled once and won, why not cash out instead of gambling again? Just take the money and call it good.

Why are you confident about that? Lots of vaporware eventually ends up nonexistent or useless or shitty.

It's just a weird thing to do, a teacher saying "I'll give you 5 dollars if you download this app on your phone". They don't get a lot out of it, and it's a weird thing to do. Like bitcoin in 2015 is barely taken anywhere and to redeem it requires them doing some shady things and the largest value is in political or philosophical realms but having a random math teacher trying to push a bunch of weird austrian economics on random students itself is weird. Worst is if you are just spreading it in hopes to increase the value of some investment you made that then lost you a ton of money. None of it is a good teacher student relationship.

If all the accounting you do is replaced by the very very basic record keeping bitcoin automates you were employed by a place that never needed an accountant at all.

What did you really expect? You basically were handing out coupons that the kids had to download some weird software their vape juice math teacher was trying to scam them into and if they did all they got was money that none of the stores around them would take. What are they gonna do? Link their bank accounts to some company in slovakia? Or buy $5 worth of computers from dell? 
I mean best case they exchange it for 5 dollars of xbox points with microsoft but even that isn't gonna be some knock their socks off thing, kids that age have been buying things online their entire life and if anything bitcoin will just seem like a harder and clunkier way to do that than the system they have used or seen used a billion times.

Hopefully you are being hyperbolic with claiming it can only go up. Please before you do this be aware that it can also go down and that you can lose money on this.
@_date: 2015-10-03 21:55:23
Not an answer! 
@_date: 2015-10-05 03:17:31
And then what? I get the hope is a glorious bitcoin future but right now bitcoin is very very very limited in use and a kid would be unlikely to be able (nor should they be able to) do the steps required to get verified at an exchange to convert it into normal money, leaving it as a weird and harder to use gift card to a small number of websites, some of which are illegal or at least dubious. 
Like seriously best case is microsoft points and I mean, that seems like a huge amount of work to get a weird and hard to use microsoft point gift card and even that only some kids even would even care about 35 dollars or whatever of microsoft points even if they wanted to put the effort in to do the stuff to claim it.

What challenge? "download this app and I'll pay you 5 dollars in a form of money that is accepted at like 5 stores you have ever heard of but I need other people to accept because I wanted to get rich but instead this has been making me get poor"?

If 500 people wanted to send 500 coins through a 55 node chain would every Bitcoin that exist need to be locked?
@_date: 2015-10-03 22:41:09
A few people mentioned the "2 way" aspect as why this isn't bad but I don't understand, is the idea that I'd buy something from new egg but it's okay because new egg would also buy things from me? I can hardly think of any scenarios in real life that are two way in that way. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 22:39:39
Is this a joke based on the fact the price is only 10 cents higher than it was yesterday?
@_date: 2015-10-03 12:45:59
Ok, so 8 hours and 12 comments later I still feel like I don't have a clear answer.
