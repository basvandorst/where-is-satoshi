The greatest sanctions risk is a long term one; that nation-states that desire to displace the U.S. dollar as a global trading currency might do so slowly, by creating a functioning parallel value-transfer system that does not move U.S. dollars or go through New York City. This would be an alternative to the SWIFT infrastructure that is essential to transferring funds today. Such a system would not respond to the current sanctions enforcement playbook.

I am talking about coin which is backed by something concrete (e.g gold) and is more stable and usable than the rest. Furthermore, this coin will also solve the problem of Volatility and usability

It's interesting to see how the price of Bitcoin has appreciated this much in the 10 years since it's inception but what's more appealing is the inception of so many new cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum, Ripple, Verge, Secure Gold Coin etc, which have made the crypto market less volatile. The real 10 year challenge is how we have evolved from a single cryptocurrency to several cryptocurrencies with distinct features like programmable contracts and money in Ethereum's case, enterprise payment settlement network in case of ripple and hybrid coin (60% gold 40% utility) in terms of Secure Gold Coin.

Greece is a perfect example to illustrate how cryptocurrency could solve economic issues. During Greece’s referendum, the government temporarily shut down the banks. This left panicked customers unable to withdraw their money. Since cryptocurrency isn’t controlled by a singular authority, a government would not be able to prevent their citizens from accessing their personal funds.

Stablecoins are the next phase of cryptocurrency.   
What do you think about this?

# Yes. We can use the recent example of Mongolia who Deploy Blockchain Payment System in Partnership with Stablecoin Startup Terra.
# Reportedly, the project aims to eventually replace the current payment methods for utility bills and government subsidies with the Terra stablecoin. This will, in effect, reform the largely cash-based Mongolia infrastructure and power the next-generation payment network using blockchain as the driving technology.

Having the optimistic approach is good, but I think when it comes to an investment I prefer realistic approach. Bitcoin can never be stable, if it can rise to $20K it might also drop to $100. Stability is the main issue that BTC is facing and no sensible investor would like to invest in a coin which is not stable at all
