What you say is generally true, but BTC is scarce. If you are speculating, you can invest in bitcoins via two methods: buy them for money (or other goods in trade), or generate them with hardware. If the hardware solution becomes more expensive but you still want to "invest", then you might be more willing to buy BTC on an exchange.

Why 5770's? I would imagine that the primary driving factors would be hardware cost and power consumption per MHash. Long-term, the hardware cost is unimportant, so I'm guessing the math works out for the 5770 vs say 5870, 6990, etc. Maybe hardware availability is a limiting factor, and the 5770's are available in droves?

I apprehensively signed up for Dwolla on say Thursday or Friday a week ago, and requested a bank account linkup (2 small deposits) during the weekend which took until Wednesday to post. Very soon after that, I started a transfer which was expected to finish by 5pm CST on June 10 (Friday), but still hasn't as of 1 am June 11, and probably won't for the rest of the weekend. Keep in mind that the money isn't even on it's way to MtGox yet, just from bank to Dwolla. We'll see how that pans out, but it's been a laborious process of standard banking hours and wait periods so far.
The average person who hears about bitcoin and thinks "OK, let's try it out" will have lost interest after more than a week has passed with no action.

Some off-the-cuff math (the calculator does all this for you):
3x 5870 @ 350 MHash/s each, consuming ~ 200 W each = 1000 MHash/s, 600 W total GPU consumption. Host system (mobo, CPU, hard drive, ram, fans) consuming ~150 W. 750W total, 80% power efficiency plus a bit is about 1000 W.
1 kWH = $0.30, 1 kWD = $8.00. deepbit.net estimates 1000 MHash/s @ 1.6 BTC/day. BTC exchange rate = $18 USD. 1.6 * $18 - $8 = $20 daily operating profit

You've got it backwards.
Price stability will give a stable ROI for mining, which will cause a stable influx/outflux of miners who individually evaluate their profitability, thus stabilizing the difficulty. If the price goes up sufficiently, new miners will enter the market until the difficulty catches up.

Just make sure to generate a totally new wallet if you do this. Apparently wallet.dat contains 100 extra pre-generated addresses which will get used when you request a new one. Ostensibly the reasoning is that if you have a recent backup and your wallet gets toasted, you still have whatever new addresses were used. If a wallet.dat is compromised and you "generate" a new address in that same wallet to transfer your funds to, it's potentially also compromised.

Same plans here. MtGox seemed like amateur hour from the beginning, which is why I used unique throw-away login information there in the first place.

Before it happened, the estimated USD volume required to buy up to that price was about $150K. Another $150K buy-in right now would carry the price past $34 with the current ask offers. I would not be surprised to see a bull-rush up to $25 or $30 tonight.
More direct data, but harder to read:

What monitoring &amp; web reporting software are you using? I'd love to be able to monitor my home mining situation while at work without having to use remote desktop or something similar.

66% doesn't sound right.
(859426 - 567358) / 567358 = 0.514786
(859426 - 567358) / 859426 = 0.339841

Looks very amateur. They advertise Paypal under "buying" on the front page but that's a lie according to their FAQ. The referral program page doesn't say why someone would want to use a referral code. Their FAQ has grammatical errors and refers to themselves as BitcoinExchange at one point.

1. GPU's will become more powerful, and specialized hardware may beat them out for overall price/performance, driving overall profits up. More likely there will be a race to the bottom as more people discover bitcoin and start up their own miners, driving the difficulty up and the profits down.
2. The price per bitcoin is independent of the production cost, those two factors drive the mining supply market (people will enter or exit the mining market depending on profitability).

How much computing time would it take to brute force one of the private keys for the "top 10" BTC accounts, each of which possess 10,000 BTC or more?
The very design of the network and the arms race of computing power is to actively fight off fraud in the block chain, but I'm not sure how the transaction keys stack up in comparison.

Someone else posted a decent rig setup with 4x 2-slot GPU capability. 
Beyond 3 GPUs you need an increasingly expensive power supply, it may actually be more cost effective to only put 2 GPUs into a single box.

Perhaps it's news to you, but the Fed balances its books by buying Treasury Bonds. If those bonds are worthless then the Fed's books are fucked and the dollar becomes baseless, similar to a Zimbabwe dollar.

I have three 5830's running in one machine, and the kill-a-watt the system is plugged into reads about 550 watts. Let's call that 600 and say electricity is $0.15 per kWh. 600/1000 * 24 = 14.4 kWh each day, and that works out to about $2.16 in electricity. If I generate 0.5 BTC per day at the current difficulty, and sell my BTC for $15, then that's about $5 profit per day.
However, I'm honestly more interested in amassing a small stockpile of bitcoins in the interest of speculation, and I'd rather do it this way than deal with another MtGox. If the price grows ten-fold from $15 then I might cash out a bit.

Where do you propose getting those 5830's for $440 now that newegg has sold out?

If a "deep pool" order gobbles up normal pool orders, the normal pool cannot help but be affected.

The market is so small that a single wealthy investor (or hoarder cashing out) can significantly move the price.

Yep, looks like a new model with a full-size displayport instead of the mini one. No free shipping on this one though.

I must say this series has been spot-on. The usability issue and the exchange solvency issue seem the largest hurdles to me. I set up a Dwolla account more than a week ago to transfer a few dollars into MtGox, and my money is still tied up in a pending transfer. I feel like bitcoin is moving too quickly for reality to keep up.

Indeed, try to use a separate computer if you can, it minimizes the chance of screw-up. That guy used a fairly convoluted/complex set of steps... keep it simple, and don't delete anything unless you're sure it's saved or duplicated; his mistake was assuming the encrypted data was the same as the updated unencrypted data, and using a new address rather than one which was confirmed to work.
It would be nice if the bitcoin client could open/close different wallet.dat files to make processes like this easier. Overall, the bitcoin client is pretty terrible about file operations; the wallet.dat should go into MyDocuments instead of AppData\Roaming, and the block chain should go into AppData\Local.

As the arms race of block-hash computing power increases, it may at some point become feasible and profitable to isolate rich addresses and attempt to brute force their keys. This would be akin to diving for sunken ships known to have gold or other valuable cargo.

Could also be that all the incoming adopters haven't got their MtGox/Dwolla/bank chain of transfer set up yet, it takes a few days.

1) Usability &amp; Security. The wallet file on your hard drive is insecure, easily lost or stolen, and is not portable. The interface is horrible and requires way too much manual data entry. Average people don't care about hiding all their money, they want a secure online bank, swipe-able physical media, and online store acceptance.
2) Solvency &amp; exchange. You need to be able to quickly and easily exchange local currency for bitcoins and back. Before this occurs, merchants will not accept BTC because they cannot quickly turn them into funds for paying their own costs. A merchant credit card account might charge a large fee, but they will give you the money far faster than the double-manual-bank-transfer currently required to get BTC into USD.
Once those issues are worked out, the proliferation of awareness, trust, and trade will follow, producing a larger and more stable bitcoin economy.

This new economy doesn't seem all that different from what we've got... the rich get richer and the poor/uninformed get nothing.
