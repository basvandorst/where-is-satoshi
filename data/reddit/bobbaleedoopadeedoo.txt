Good question... I'd imagne it would decline. But idk...
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:24:32
Ah. Yes, there is that.
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:15:53
Oh, no? Why's that?
@_date: 2019-08-17 12:34:00
Fair enough. Thank you for the shake up.
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:56:48
Yes, this is a good point... I guess I didn't clarify or even really think about it. But yes, when your BTC is in Cash App, seeing as you don't have Keys, you don't have BTC. :/ Damn.
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:51:14
This is actually a really good point more I think about it... Do you think doing this--the Cash App's method of "using" BTC--might actually be a hindrance to adoption?
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:23:54
? I'm not complaining.. i have had no issues as of yet. But that's good to know your experience. The cool thing in my opinion is that "Wells Fargo" *won't* be doing it... There's no need for something like that. Heck, at this rate, it will liekly be Square themselves, or some other tech giant doing it in-house!
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:54:43
I'm not sure I exact;y follow... ( alittle slow today lol) But, users do not set fees--they are fixed by the app. I have wondered about this myself, as far as, how does the app navigate this concer, but, it has always been super-fast tx time and have never had any issues with non-confirmation (unlike when I have had that problem MANY times while using, for example, the Blockchain.com wallet. I've waited close to a DAY for conf. :/ )
I'll have to look more into it, though... Thanks for bringing it up!
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:48:13
Oh, no, really? Did not know that :( Maybe soon?
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:50:24
Umm... I always thougt it was closer to 1%.. And ime, it's only when buying BTC you get a "fee" (baked in lower/higher price) which is to be expected... Still less trouble than sending to 3rd party, selling, sending back, etc. etc....
@_date: 2019-08-13 10:01:20
Ah! Yes, I'd forgotten about the,m... That's one with their own token, right? And there's a subsidiary (or is Crypto.com the subsidiary of the other...?) Imma check it out. Any bennies/ promo codes/ sign-up bonuses you know of?
@_date: 2019-08-11 20:54:43
Yes, I did state in my post the approx. 1% fee when purchasing Bitcoin. may be even less than that. Though I have no doubt they will very likely increase that in the future.
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:48:56
Fair enough. But just to be clear: Even with LN you are not "using BTC to purchase directly..."
@_date: 2019-08-13 09:59:44
I think, as many have used the example, it will be like the US Post Office. Since the inception of email, yes, "regular" mail has diminished/ suffered, but it is still used and still serves a purpose. Same will happen with banks/ crypto, imo. Crypto, like email, will probably "take over" as it's just more efficient--or at least companies will incorporate some aspects of it. But vestiges of the legacy system will likely remain. So I suppose I do agree w u on that front.

Yes. I've learned this the hard way. Theres actually some bible verse about it believe it or not lol. I'm not a religious guy but it seemed appropriate. Something like 
"Those who have less will have everything taken away" or some shit like that. 
Basically, if you spend beyond your means, eventually you'll have no means to spend. Buying only 5 bucks worth a week is better than panic selling at a loss bc you needed that money for rent. Believe me. It's not going to "go up and make up for it", at least not right when you need it to...

I remember buying something with bitcoin back in 2014 when it was like $350 a coin and having some dust / change left over. Then when I re-heard about its popularity,  going back and seeing like $35 usd in my coinbase acct. That was exciting.

I'd have to second that last part. To those thinking they might "beat the system," good luck. You may eventually, but I've "wasted" many dollars simply by investing money I "couldn't afford," THINKING (delusional) I will "make profits" (i.e., make back the money I actually needed in the first place). But when that doesn't happen you're left w the bag and less some because your dumbass has to sell back out, USUALLY at a loss, to buy the bullshit you needed in the first place. 
It's not worth it. Unless you are experienced trader, or have money to burn, I would highly suggest either a "lump-sum" investment you lock away/ make it too difficult/ inconvenient to touch so you're not tempted, or just buy TINY amounts - like 10-20 bucks amount you can not even really notice (it will add up and better than losing money).
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:25:16
You also gotta remember: "back then," there wasn't all this hard-fork, BSV craziness, either. Although I'm not so naive as to presume there wasn't/ hasn't always been *some* kind of "fud" flying around... Perhaps someone whose been around a while could chime in? People who were here since before BCH: Do you feel that the BCH fork was "so impactful" that it could truly have made a vast difference in the "trajectory" of Bitcoin, or is all of that - including the CSW, Satoshi situation - just more "fud" engineered to get you to part with your beloved BTC?? Asking for a friend.

He's really not that "flamboyant" and "attention-seeking," in my opinion.. Maybe in some ways, but he just doesn't strike me as such. I would bet if CSW actually did all the interviews/ spent as much time "in the limelight" as the world actually wanted/ would take of him, we'd be seeing a lot *more* of the guy, frankly.. If anything, I feel he tries to do the *opposite* of that; namely, he seems to *purposefully* make the community  dislike him.
Secondly, I actually just got through going over some of his (CSW), Hal Finney, and some other project "OG's" emails/ messages via the BitcoinTalk forums of early 2009, and, actually, I was quite amused at how I found myself reading some of Satoshi's statements *in Craig Wright's voice -* and actually having it feel rather natural and "familiar" as I hadn't even realized I was doing it. I left those pages *more*  convinced CSW was Satoshi - which, mind you, had *not* been my intention. Though I do also think Hal himself is still a possible candidate as well.
I would be highly, *highly* amazed if whomever *did* write those messages on bitcointalk did *not* have "English as a first language." Very surprised. Anyone who has a decent mastery of the language themselves would, in my opinion, quite likely agree. I don't think I saw one misspelling or grammatical error in all of Satoshi's Bitcointalk posts. Which is an interesting, and perhaps valuable "clue," as I'm realizing I'm not quite familiar enough with CSW's known writing's to make a comparison - though this fact in itself may just be a cunning way to attempt to mislead or evade his questioners. I digress. What we *do* know is that it's very likely, in my opinion, that Satoshi from the bitcointak forums was quite likely British in origin, not Japanese as some - including Finney himself - conjectured.
It's also key to remember whoever Satoshi is, they are a human. And humans have egos. And egos can be irrational, no matter how much we might try and deny or even control it. Therefore they can and will make "mistakes."

"In Komodo,  which is a system very similar to Delegated Proof of Stake, the Notary  nodes automatically put their OP\_RETURN proofs into the Bitcoin  blockchain just by the virtue of existing. These nodes get their rewards  by securing the DPoS system. New coins can join DPoW only by requesting  the developers, who then add the coin to the protection umbrella.  Interestingly, the Notary nodes (users) have no say in this.
This is not viable in a Proof of Work system, which is decentralized"

Totally agree.  Sorry (I know this will be unpopular bc it is "against Satoshi" but, "money" (if you equate this only to a cash like item) was not the main and great achievement of Bitcoin - as you said, it is a Globally secure Timestamp/ Data integrity "server".  "money" is going to look very different with bitcoin.  Veriblock's use of the blockchain is just the tip of the iceberg, imo.  SO many amazing things can be done with this tech aside from simply "dollars," which within Bitcoin is just Data.. As is a timestamp, as is xyz, whatever people are willing to pay to put in there should be equally valid which is the point of it to begin with - decentralization!

Don't quote me on this, but I believe it's only over a certain amount, like $5,000, which is a decent amount... But I don't know for sure. I don't know why merely exchanging would be against the law - especially if they're the buyer, you'd think it would be on them to "ask for ID," get "KYC," like when I used to go to the coin shop and sell some of my old silver quarters, they'd look at my ID and write it down.

Because CSW is correct in  the fact that having control of a Private Key does NOT guarantee "Identity" at least in any sense we usually use the term... And he can hide behind that fact. 
CSW is correct : using the genesis key to "move coins" won't "prove" anything, BUT, it def wouldn't Hurt... which is what I think folks are tapping into. It's a dilemma for sure.

Umm... Yes they are... Here: 
"You can't take a key and 'prove' back in time.." A Private key cannot "prove" an Identity. There's a disconnect. Only way would be to somehow show he had possession of the Key at the time the genesis block was made (this is getting into some interesting stuff, though... like opening the door to like BTC tattoos or something lol)
