I'm also aware that companies like Coinbase monitor transactions, but even if Circle does the same thing, that shouldn't matter in my case, because every coin I've purchased on Circle is still owned by me and held on a paper wallet.

If they want to operate this way, that's their prerogative, I just wish they'd decide whether they want my business before accepting my deposit. Now I basically get blackmailed into providing anything they demand or forfeiting my deposit. That doesn't seem fair.

I was in the same boat as you until yesterday.

I feel like the name was an omninous clue as to how they're going to spin me around in a figurative circle of information requests until I concede and forfeit my money.

No thanks, I'd rather not pay a ridulous premium for a service that primarily caters to credit card fraud.

Unfortunately my urgent issue exists outside their 4 hour, weekday-only window. I guess I'll try them on Monday. Thanks for posting that, I couldn't access a number or the Live Chat with an account that's locked.

I was hoping it was that clowns exchange that shut down. Seeing the way he conducts himself on BitcoinTalk gets me excited for the day that his bullshit blows up in his face. His ego is out of control.

Their policy already requires that I wait 4-5 days for my deposit, then after that wait,  all I get is a vague message telling me I can't access my account, with no way to access chat or anything, Email is slow, and the service is shitty. I don't think anyone dealing with a flawed service should feel like they can't take their problem to a forum. I can see why you wouldn't want people publicly raising issues with your service, but that's clearly not advantageious to the consumer.

This is the only thing I can get to when I log into my account:
No explanation of any kind.

Did you have money sitting in your account?
