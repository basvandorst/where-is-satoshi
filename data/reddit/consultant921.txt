I agree with you. Transaction malleability only lets an attacker steal coins by claiming that their first transaction didn't go through when it did and getting the exchange for issue another transaction to "fix" the problem. No doubt MtGox would have noticed this happening over and over again if it were used to withdraw 744K BTC and that would have raised a flag very quickly.
If there any other way to use malleability to steal coins, I am not aware of it.
I am guessing that if the coins were stolen, it was not through malleability. Perhaps they were not stolen at all, but embezzled, or perhaps there was no big theft or embezzlement but it's just that MtGox is getting acquired by some other company and the deal needs to be kept under wraps and these accusations of insolvency are just hoaxes or rumors used to manipulate the market.

I uploaded my MtGox history but it only seems to recognize 2013 transactions. Any older buys are not shown and my basis for the sales in 2013 is shown as 0.

It should be able to figure out the cost basis by looking at the complete history using the FIFO method. The trades from 2012 are relevant for the 2013 return because they affect the cost basis.

Suppose I bought 100 bitcoins in 2010 for $1 each in MtGox then left them there until June 2013 so the value of my account went to $20,000 or more at some point, but I never sold them and then I withdrew them to a private wallet. It sounds like I would need to disclose this using the FBAR form, correct?

The escrow company was doing everything they could, calling their bank Wells Fargo every 4 hours for days.
The agreement did have a "force majeure" clause as you say. The closing agent said that my bank Ally was acting as my agent so I could be liable for their ineptness. Once the problem had passed, I did ask the closing agent if the seller could really have taken the escrow deposit and he said "this is a question that a judge could answer after hearing all the evidence". At the very least I would have had to go to court incurring large costs and probably would have lost the house purchase. At worst I would have lost the deposit, legal costs, time, and the house.

It was a domestic wire transfer, yet it still go flagged by OFAC. And correct, using bitcoin would have prevented anyone delaying the transfer.

The dollars did not come from bitcoin, but from many years of hard work and saving. I wish I had enough bitcoins to buy a house!

Cashiers check for me from now on. I will never do a large wire transfer again unless I am prepared to wait a couple of weeks.
