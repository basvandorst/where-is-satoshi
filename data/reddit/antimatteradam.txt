After talking to some people on here and in other communities I started a "crypto merch" store. With an emphasis on bitcoin since it is my favorite. Most other sites offer cheap products and uncomfortable and itchy material. I wanted to raise the bar to match the quality of bitcoin. You can find plenty of designs at bitninjasupply.com and browse the different sections. Ill be redoing the site soon. Enjoy and offer any feedback you deem fitting.

Are you using bitpay?
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:27:05
Thats good. I had a horrible experience with it but ive heard of some people having a good outcome. Checkout gocoin if you want to accept litecoin and dash.

Ive made all mine and I want to be apart of the people here. I make hardly anything I just want to be apart of the movement and do my part. If this is the wrong place Ill go elsewhere. Its no sweat off my back. Gotta try to distance myself from the others that post here shilling. Any suggestions would be appciated. Thought id make a play off those "I'm not 16 but" posts that I've seen. I thought it was funny lol

"fiat currencies are backed by collective hallucination, just like cryptos"

On shopify you have to use a broker unless ypu can code a secure checkout yourself. Bitpay can be integrated into shopify's billing system. Thats why I asked.

Thats half the battle! Good luck brother.

HIVE, MGTI and GBTC are crypto related stocks. If thats what you're asking about. MGTI and GBTC have been good to me. Unrelated to crypto I also do a diversified international stock opti on through my company.

Bitcoin trades for about $3000 more in South Korea than it does here in the states where I'm from. Its illegal to bring large sums of Bitcoin and they have the right to check your ledger. So if you have a ledger that displays a smaller amount than whats actually on there then you have a better chance of smuggling bitcoin into the country and capitalizing on the market difference.

Thank you thank you thank you.

ledgerwallet supports ripple yes but I'm not sure about funfair. They do support a number of cpins though. The info is on their page. 
There are videos on youtube
this one may or may not be helpful. 
Happy trading :)

I tried to get that card and the purchase failed. They said to wait for a refund email which i never received.  I forgot about that issue. Add that to the list.  Glad im not the only one.

The one thing coinbase does right is ease of use. They definitely helped lead the crypto revolution. But I agree, anyone wanting to purchase more than once should look into other exchanges. I stumbled upon binance a while back and like it. To each their own. Crypto is crypto no matter where its at.

valid point lol. at the time i was looking for an exchange to trade iota. came across binance and one thing led to another and now we're married with four kids.

In unrelated news Morgan Stanley as nothing to gain by devaluing bitcoin. In fact they would be better off writing an article about pandas.

if you actively trade leave the amount you play with on the server. take everything else off. ledgerwallet.com offers hardware wallets. if your money is on a server and it shuts down or something else happens you're out that money.
