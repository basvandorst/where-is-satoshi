I'm pretty sure you can just use the same one it might even use the same directory automatically, start xt manually and see if it syncs up before you use armory. You may not even need to tell armory about a new directory just don't let it start bitcoin qt

Out-of-order Processing
Sometimes network traffic can cause near-simultaneous API calls to arrive out of order. Since the nonce must always be increasing, an API call with a higher nonce may arrive earlier than a separate call with a lower nonce if they are initiated very quickly together. When this happens, the second call will be dropped as invalid. To fix this, a separate expire parameter can be included, specifying a unix timestamp after which the call will not process. When the expire parameter is included, the nonce is ignored. We recommend setting the expire parameter to no greater than 15 minutes in the future to prevent replay attempts.

mining gaps, miners waiting until enough transaction fees before even starting a block, the need for transaction backlog otherwise they'll wait. They'll start doing this at the next halvening. A big block and no backlog may have everyone waiting over 10 minutes to even begin. This will allow 51% attack much easier. This will destroy litecoin, I can't wait

Why are you trying to refund? They got the photos and are happy right? That's your money.. This break up is a private matter.
You seem to have talent, used the talent and that's all legit. I don't see the scam. Him bedding you with possible lies is between you guys, but publicly you did nothing wrong.
You should continue using your talents under your own name if you don't like ftb. But saying what you did wasn't good work is wrong, have confidence in yourself.

Woah, never thought of mining gaps, miners waiting until enough transaction fees before even starting a block, the need for transaction backlog otherwise they'll wait. They'll start doing this at the next halvening. A big block and no backlog may have everyone waiting over 10 minutes to even begin. This will allow 51% attack much easier.

Paycoin and Homero
@_date: 2015-09-28 21:45:04
Maxcoin, startcoin, etc. There was another earlier one I forget
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:59:25
Wait Bitcoin is limited too? Geez glad I barely leave any on there
@_date: 2015-09-29 04:14:37
Max is worse than Homero
@_date: 2015-09-08 11:05:10
@_date: 2015-09-02 23:13:44
It's a scam
@_date: 2015-09-04 06:12:47
They have the best Bitcoin checkout ever
@_date: 2015-09-29 12:53:47
There's good escrows at bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2015-09-12 22:20:38
Very stupid people who invest in paycoin and ponzis, once scammed they shill like their life depends on it, that fails and they're onto the next scam
@_date: 2015-09-21 00:36:22
Yup and back those up
@_date: 2015-09-20 05:35:03
How can she be a fraud if she really took photos? A pimp taking her money is a different story.

Oh you're right, new transactions would be, they have nothing to do with the genesis

Sweet next is Homero
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:01:25
But the next mining gap presentation brought up good points against too big blocks

It's not a bad deal but developers can be poor and most prototypes should be below cost to promote development, without apps products are worthless
@_date: 2015-09-21 13:56:17
I only see shitcoining, scam site and shilling wallets for donations

@_date: 2015-09-06 03:07:10
It's good
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:24:26
Idk but I bought 6! 
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:15:36
Try wiping just armory then put back the wallets
Armory disconnects if Bitcoin has too many connectors, it actually uses p2p not rpc, that may be an issue if you're limiting the connections
@_date: 2015-09-02 19:55:54
Yeah I don't know what their problem is, I had to go back to coinbase temporarily
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:19:26

Not 20?
@_date: 2015-09-05 21:37:46
Every cloud mining or investment has been a scam until now, this one is even more shady, just my feeling and history
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:35:14

Ltbcoin it's pretty cool, I don't think it was serious though, just fun
It's not even a coin, it's counterparty

At least Homero doesn't have the domain anymore
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:56:19
Sorry man it says to print it, that's the point of cold storage otherwise anyone can retrieve it
@_date: 2015-09-16 07:52:41
You can just use one, write the seed then wipe it
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:17:45
Yes but you're limited to withdrawing $3k of Bitcoin you own. That's absurd for a wallet, if you deposit 100 btc it'll take you 10 weeks to get it it out
Rich people must avoid circle! 
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:26:18
That's because you haven't used the limit yet
@_date: 2015-09-25 00:56:08

@_date: 2015-09-13 01:19:03
Dump them
@_date: 2015-09-06 01:54:08
Because Bitcoin is already risky enough without losing it to scammers
@_date: 2015-09-20 08:55:55
Exactly, it's what I'd like to see 👀

Don't uninstall, it might leave the database. Find armory in appdata and delete everything but the wallets. Armory keeps a database bigger than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-30 15:26:36
Now send shitcoin back to your family! 
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:22:42

@_date: 2015-09-04 05:48:27
Coinbase pays your fee and change address is normal

Make sure you get dem paycoin

You are still helping share the blockchain though so it was helpful
@_date: 2015-09-22 02:04:42

Good job Mike.

Amount doesn't matter. You can reuse addresses but privacy is effected. Say it's on your blog and someone send you a million dollars. Now the whole world knows you have a million dollars

What's really cool is that older wallet transactions won't get relayed but will because of the attack. Attackers will malleate and relay the correct version for them.

Gemini isn't a wallet but probably as secure. Coinbase let's you use multisig.
You should use your own wallet. If you still want a cloud wallet use coinbase. But mycelium or copay are much more secure.
