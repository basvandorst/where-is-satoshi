As I see it, Bitcoin is like a pipeline for transporting value. It's a method to transfer value from Person A to Person B digitally. That seems cool, but for it to work it really doesn't _matter_ whether Bitcoin is worth $1 or $5,000 per coin, if you want to send $50usd to Person B you can simply send $50 USD of bitcoin at that moment.
On the other hand, buying and holding bitcoin because you believe the value of the coin will go up is like buying and holding pipeline, because the value of the metal in the pipe might go up. You're missing the whole point of what makes it useful, and if everybody becomes 'investors' instead of people who needs transportation then it stops becoming as useful to everybody.
Bitcoin is about as much an 'investment' as buying a transit token today and hoping the price goes up. The real value is that it can GET YOU PLACES today, not a speculative change in a price point.
Never **buy** more than you can afford to lose. It _is_ a gamble, but it's not even gambl_ing_ because it's not a game of chance it's just pure risk.

lol, I wasn't trying to get a refund, Paypal messed up my balance while it was just sitting here. I called them to get them to just…undo whatever they did.

Well it completely levels the playing field internationally - anybody who can get their local currency _into_ the e-currency can do business with you, no matter what your preferred local currency is. There's no difference to being paid from USD -&gt; Tokens -&gt; USD as Euro -&gt; Tokens -&gt; USD.
I live in one country but currently get paid in USD. My money gets converted to my local currency when it his my bank. When I visit the US I convert some of my money from my bank account back into USD at a premium, and by then I've lost money twice on each dollar.
Right now I'm losing money twice without magic internet bucks, but if I theoretically were to be paid in tokens and then only converted to local currency what I needed and only converted what I needed in USD when I traveled, I would only be losing money converting it once. Just saying.

it's also great as digital cash for anything you could use cash for, which is a lot more than just drugs and exploiting humans.

Care to explain why holding metals are trash?
I'm not talking about metals that are precious only because of their rarity, but metals that have plentiful industrial applications that ensure their value to humans in the future as well. We use gold and silver in industry and medicine and would be hard pressed to replace them in many cases.
I'm curious what makes holding metal a bad idea?

Who would the spies be spying for, and what would they be doing?
It just feels contrived to me to be looking over your shoulder for spies all the time if you have nothing for them to spy on. I've never worried about spies before even when there was a guy we suspected was a spy. What do I stand to lose through their research?

It's *true* that gold won't fit in your phone - but I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing! What if you lose your phone?
I find that bitcoin addresses are *too* small and easy to misplace. [30% of Bitcoiners admit to losing coin due to theft or stupidity]( after all…
To secure my bitcoins I would be locking them up in the same safe I would use to protect my gold (if I had any), so I'm not sure that they are any different in practice. (I have a safe, just no bitcoins or gold btw)
I don't agree with the 'can't be seized' thing though, we've seen them be seized already in the US, so I'm not sure where the idea that they are invincible from seizure comes from. Of course they can't seize what they don't know to exist - but in that regard isn't holding metal a bit *better* than holding bitcoins? There's no 'nuggetchain' in the world keeping track of who buys gold, but there *is* a 'blockchain' recording who receives bitcoin. Doesn't that make your bitcoin stash more vulnerable to disclosure from prying eyes?

Hi Proppin8easy, I'm not a Bitter but I sure do build a lot of ecommerce sites!
I know it sounds tinfoil-hatty, but there's isn't yet a payment gateway I would trust enough to put on my site. Until/unless somebody with a proven track record of security, well-documented integration, and a broad community of programmers you can hire to work on and fix and update the payment gateway as your site grows and changes decides to begin supporting Bitcoin as well, I would be very cautious about integrating unproven gateways and out some safeguards in place in your site around the untrusted gateway to mitigate the risk.
This is coming from a web development perspective, I don't drink the Bitcoin koolaid. Be vigilant, what more important to you: the success of your business, or a set of financial ideals?
TLDR: Bitcoin might be great, but it's hard to trust any ecommerce gateways that use it at this point. Real talk.

What about silver or gold? They also require mining, aren't backed by any nation, are anonymous by nature, and have proven themselves reliable stores of value throughout all cultures in history.
Would you also put your savings into physical metal as well?

To be honest, I don't know - why?
Is it that it's still cheaper to buy it than to extract it from that known location? Is it slated for future development?

it exists outside of regulation which means you can transfer money easily to any person on the planet!
For example, my sister studied abroad and we had to find some very convoluted ways to transfer money to her internationally to pay rent and for school. She lived in the US at the time (and we didn't). Eventually Paypal became the standard for this sort of thing, but if you've ever had to deal with Paypal support t get a wrong transaction fixed you'd understand why having options is a good thing.
Bitcoin and other alt-coins provide a way to send value using a system totally decoupled to political influence, which is a big deal internationally.
Buying bitcoin to hold bitcoin seems like a silly way to invest money. Bitcoins value exists in its ability to send money, not store it.

I've lost physical coins before, but I've also found coins. I don't know how many people have ever stumbled across a bitcoin lying unattended.
My point is that bitcoin can be confusing or vulnerable *even when* the people know what they are doing. 30% is too high for me.

…but if you never intend to sell it, what is it truly worth to you?

Both of these rules are very good advice - don't put all your eggs in one basket! Diversify your holdings :D
Definitely things we should all do moving forward
