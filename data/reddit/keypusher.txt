Watch the video of how they did it, basically created a distraction and came up behind him and he had no chance to react.  The real mistake was choice of venue, choosing library wifi for security and sitting with his back exposed was a big mistake, in retrospect.

it's entirely possible to trade on leverage, many exchanges offer this


large transfers are often done OTC


trades on an exchange do not get committed to the blockchain.  it's all just moving numbers around in the exchange's database

Go look at the China exchange-banning crash from 5k to 3k.  It brought absolutely everything else down with it.  eth, ltc, ripple, alts, it pretty much all went down.  When btc slows down a bit and people switch over to ltc for a couple days, that's one thing.  When btc actually crashes, watch out.

It's funny how so many people have this story about they heard about bitcoin at $1, $5, $250, $1000, whatever.  "I was going to invest!  But then, I didn't, because..."  90% of this sub was right there with you.  Everyone (even those who have made incredible gains) can tell you about how they could have gotten in earlier, could have traded differently, etc.  Don't feel bad about it, it's a difficult psychological hurdle to overcome.


yes.  i believe it's a very large factor in the growth of bitcoin.  when i look at the political situation, the rising debt, the geopolitical unrest, the environment, the economy, it's clearly not good.  i can almost see the history textbooks 50 or 100 years from now pointing out all these factors and how they proceeded the collapse and how obvious the warning signs were.  and many people feel the same.  people just don't trust the government (not just the US, but china, korea, and europe too), the corporations, "the system" anymore.  i think that collectively, as a society, we are starting to feel that something just isn't right, and that's probably not going to end well.

To go into further detail from the other answer:
Let's say current BTC price is $15k.  If you enter a "limit buy" order at $14k, it will just sit there on the order book.  You are therefore a market maker, as you are populating the order book, creating the market.  If BTC goes down to $14k, your buy will hit.  If BTC goes up to $20k, your order will not hit, but just sit on the book until it does or you cancel it.  Same thing, in reverse, for a "limit sell".
A market taker is someone who executes a "market" order, or who executes a limit order that crosses the "spread".  A market order will just buy at whatever the lowest available sell (ask) price is.  The spread is the difference between the lowest sell (ask) and highest buy (bid).  You have to click a special button under "advanced" in GDAX to cross the spread on a limit order.

lol this isn't a btc breakout, it's people trying to escape the tether implosion.
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:09:20
The current outstanding market cap of Tether is ~$2.4 billion.  I have no problem believing that Bitfinex made a lot of money in the last 2 years.  I wouldn't be surprised if they have a couple hundred million in cash.  But do they have $2 billion just sitting around?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:14:06
Doubt it.  They probably found a large OTC buyer and have agreed to a price already.  They aren't just going to go dump it on bittrex rofl.

Until there are more sellers than buyers.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:10:44
I think you have this somewhat backwards.  The value is driven by supply vs demand.  Trades are an indication that there is an imbalance in market (some people think price should be lower, some think it should be higher).  Trading is an effect, a symptom, of demand.  Trading volume dies down as price stabilizes, as both sides of the market have come to an agreement on the current price.  The price does not approach zero because trading stops, it does so due to lack of demand, which causes trading to stop.

The thing is, that's not unique anymore.  There are plenty of other, better, faster, lower transaction-fee coins out there for payments.  If your goal is fast and cheap payments, you shouldn't really be looking at btc or bch.  Is bch better in this respect than btc?  Currently, yes.  Is it the best?  Not even close.  If bch wants to stand up on its technical merits alone, it will get absolutely destroyed.  It can't even compete with Litecoin or Eth, let alone some of the newer tech out there.

[Scaling Bitcoin to Billions Of Transactions Per Day](  This is a presentation on how this will happen.  Activating segwit was the first step, lightening network on top will complete it.  This presentation was from 2 years ago, developers understand the problem very well and solution is already coming.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:36:57
I believe that is a backronym.  The original phrase comes from a poorly written bitcointalk thread.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:42:44
Amount sent does not influence transaction cost.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:12:20
Uhh, pretty much every crypto has "node decentralization".  That's what blockchains are built on, independent nodes building a consistent transaction record via a common protocol.  Unless I am misunderstanding you?  The defining features of Bitcoin at this point are name recognition, market cap, and slow transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:20:46
That chart shows the total number of nodes, which is only one measure of decentralization.  I would also look at something like [this]( which shows how concentrated the hashpower is among miners.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:35:56
Most of what you have said I agree with, except for this idea that trading volume somehow drives value, which is where we started.  USD did not become the preferred reserve currency because of high trade volume, it did so because for a long time the United States economy dwarfed any other nation, coupled with US dominance of military and geopolitical power.  When investors wanted to put billions of dollars into a currency that would hold its value, they chose USD, which created demand for it.  The fact that it now has high liquidity is a result of that, which makes it even more attractive.
Imagine I hold 1000 btc.  I send them to my friend, in exchange for whatever.  He then sends them back.  We do this all day, for months.  At the end, we are exactly where we started.  Is bitcoin now somehow more valuable because it has been traded more times?  No.  If trade volume drove price, there would be a direct correlation between volume and price.  There is not.  High volume can happen when prices are crashing just as it can when prices are booming.  Volume has a relation to price, and is a powerful factor to consider when trying to predict future prices, but it is not the driving force.  It is changes in supply/demand, which results in volume, that ultimately determines price.
Also, if you believe what you are saying, you should not be buying/holding btc.  Eth, for instance, consistently has more daily transactions than btc.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:24:47


In what way?  Can you be more specific about how bitcoin is unique in this way?


I'm not losing anything, been in BTC for quite a while.  Very happy right now, I just take a critical view when people say things that don't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:09:00
Sounds like a good way to get robbed.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:29:39
Far more than that I believe.  Due to the fact that coins were so much easier to mine and worth so much less in the early days, there's tons of coins out there that are lost.  Satoshi alone has over 1 million btc, which is ~8% of total supply, and those coins are never coming back in.  I would guess 15-20% might be lost.  There are actually people out there actively trying to crack wallets from old, inactive wallets using shared compute power.
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:36:43
You want to see what a profitable bitcoin mining operation looks like?
Warehouses full of ASIC machines, powered by very cheap electricity.  There is no profit to be made for the average person mining bitcoin today, that passed years ago.  You are better to take that $500 and buy bitcoin, then let it sit for a few years.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:06:54
I hear a lot of people say this, but honestly, I doubt you will.  If bitcoin crashes, it will be on some terrible news.  Like the SEC is cracking down and shutting exchanges, or Coinbase gets hacked.  When that happens you won't buy, because you will think Bitcoin is over.  Just like so most people didn't start buying after Mt Gox closed down and BTC went from $1000 to $200 overnight.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:16:34
Buying from something like coinbase is very easy, but you will have to submit more information the more you want to buy (such as picture of ID).  This is to prevent money laundering and comply with KYC (know your customer) laws.

@_date: 2017-10-24 07:21:27


That's true on reddit, but I don't think it's true of the larger market.  85% of miners are still signaling support for 2X on new blocks.  Many people out there want larger blocks, and don't really know or care about Core vs NYA, etc.
@_date: 2018-07-03 08:28:56
it's a strange coincidence because they have nothing to do with each other
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:29:39
Because it was designed as an upgrade to the core protocol.  It was not originally intended for both chains to survive, only the one with majority hashing power.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:04:58


That was certainly part of the original vision.  Also a store of value.  Today, it has also become the reserve currency for all other cryptocurrencies.  But I believe its current value is mostly due to people realizing the huge potential of decentralized currencies in general, and bitcoin being the market leader and backbone.  Consider being an early investor in Apple, Amazon or Google.  Let's say 15-20 years ago.  Companies with a big vision and lots of potential, but also the potential to fail spectacularly and lose your money.  Does Bitcoin have issues with scalability, regulation, governance, and usability today?  Yes.  Are those unsolvable problems that fundamentally doom cyrptocurrencies and can never be fixed no matter how many smart people throw billions of dollars at them over the next few decades?  History suggests such problems get solved rather quickly once the technology is there. 


Something like Ripple (XRP) is far better suited to the remittance market.  Just like there are many other currencies coming out that are better suited to specific tasks.  But with each new niche coin that comes out, BTC just seems to get stronger because it is the backbone of this whole new economy.
@_date: 2017-10-30 08:02:07
Start putting some money in every week.  $25, $50, $100, whatever.  You will "dollar cost average" in.  You won't get the absolute lowest price, but you won't get the highest price either.  If BTC goes down from here, you will be glad you didn't buy it all up front.  If BTC goes up, at least you bought some while it was lower.

Putting all your arguments in bold does not make them more convincing.  
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:11:35
The only alternative is to keep your coins on an exchange or with a third-party (who manages the private key for you), which is generally discouraged as you are then trusting the third party not to get hacked, steal your coins, go bankrupt, etc.
To crack a private key (if you lost it and want to try to solve it) would take billions of years with current supercomputing power.  Unless there are incredible improvements in quantum computing in the near future, it's not going to happen.
