will go lower than 7.5k
@_date: 2018-08-08 18:28:01
Depends where you live.
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:10:26
You said it wasn't going to go below 7.5 yesterday. Just stop posting please.
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:26:32
I'm still waiting on institutional investors... If they don't come, what do I have to look forward to? Chinese New Year again? :) :) :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:30:00
Subtract two wheels and your closer. A Huffy.
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:46:43
One word? No. I imagine the difficulty of cracking it scales very quickly the less words they have. That's why just adding a special character or a capital letter to everyday passwords make them exponentially more difficult to crack.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:47:30
Ugh. I can't wait for Chinese New Year again and for Bitcoin to hit 20k!
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:58:18
They all had hoped they'd be up 1000&amp; by now, but once they realized that wasn't going to happen in the near future, they all packed up their memes and left. My reverse Bart formation analysis is that this sub is going to continue to be a relative ghost town until bitcoin is back above 15000.
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:05:42
yep the next few months are going to be amazing for the HODLers because just look at the charts same time last year. buy the dip and don't be stupid1!1!
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:19:26
Who is going to bring the price up to a new all time high in a year and a half? The normies are gone, even the 'buy-the-dip' folks have virtually disappeared,  and now we place our faith in the 'institutional buy ins', which may never materialize as long as volume and interest is this anemic. Even if/when it starts to rise, people are still going to be selling constantly to just exit the market to break even and to take profits all the way up. This market will take many, many years to reach a new all time high. I'm going to HODL some of my investment for Moon^(tm)  and actual usage, but I am definitely selling most on the way up; I don't like the risk anymore. My money can be invested much better elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:20:44
Likewise! But remember, even going back up to 20k is only, what, a \~300&amp; increase from our current price? Good luck on your 20000&amp; gains next year!
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:57:07
That's not true. I saw a post the other day on this sub that said Pokemon Go hit tens of millions of users in less than a year.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:29:15
Are you even the author of this post?


Why would you write that if you think buying at 6k is laughable?
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:41:11
It's not fine to invest in something that is 6k, and then drops to 1k, and then keeps you in the red for 'years'. That's a pretty shitty investment. You'd be better off investing in traditional companies for 'years', and then spending the profits you made on those to invest in Bitcoin when the magical turn around 'happens'.
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:31:25
'Buy the dip' is now a meme on life support with this volume day after day.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:37:00
The run up to 20k is what mainstream adoption looked like... the normies get in trying to get rich with no one actually using it. Now the second bull run is going to have to have a second wave of idiots trying to get rich, but it's going to take time to find them and to persuade them to HODL for years.
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:30:30
No way. Not even the buy the dip folks are making it into these threads recently. Dark times ahead. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:46:27
As someone who uses Bitcoin and as someone who accepts Bitcion at their business, I'm loving the stability of the coin lately. However, with that said, I can't wait for Chinese New Year. :\) :\) :\)
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:46:22
HODL and 'buy the dip' are beginning to lose their appeal even to some of the faithful... No one wants to keep buying when something continually loses value week after week, and their only insurance that it will rise again is faith and a meme economy propping the thing up.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:10:06
I think there are a lot of people in that boat. May as well cut your loses (or some) and invest in something that will steadily rise over the years (traditional investments) instead of something that remains stagnant or declines. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:22:41
Exactly! I've been telling this to institutional investors^(TM) all year. Let's hope this leads to a new bull run! If not, there is always Chinese New Year to look forward to!
@_date: 2019-01-18 22:37:53
I had ~5 bitcoin in 2017, and I still have ~5 bitcoin. How did I get ownd? I haven't lost anything.

@_date: 2018-11-14 21:33:06
lol, said no one ever. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:10:49
Ok let's settle down.
@_date: 2018-07-05 22:04:34
The NYPost is not really a legitimate source of news. It's tabloid news. Therefore, the editors don't give a shit about what is true or not, only what is salacious and get's clicks from the normies.
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:13:10
That's true but where are all the new buyers going to come from? The normies packed up and left, and institutional investors are just a meme at this point. It's going to take years for this to recover. I don't think we are going to see a massive entrance to the market driven by a frenzied greed again. People's expectations are extremely tempered now.
@_date: 2018-07-12 18:21:04
It's been eclipsed by the whales. We are at their mercy now. :) :) :) All hail our whale overlords.
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:51:03
I really doubt it's even going to get that high. People have learned how to trade Bitcoin quite effectively much to the detriment of HODLers.  You see how many people take profits on the smallest upward movements now. That's going to happen ALL the way up. It could be another 2-3 years before we see 12-15k again (if at all). That's why I am dumping my cash in actual stocks now that have more potential growth. I 'bought the dip' like six times this year, but clearly that strategy is for fools now, seeing that every rally has a corresponding and larger dump.
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:13:03
That's because the normies jumped in on the excitement. Where is the excitement that is going to bring the normies back? We are sitting sideways/down for a loooong time. We are not hitting 20k again this year. That is a complete pipedream.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:38:17
See you at 100!
