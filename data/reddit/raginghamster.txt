Because the phrase "just saying" is not meant to be taken as a literal fact, rather it is used to emphasize that the typer's opinion is usually meant to be taken on objective pretenses and isn't simply a subjective or completely biased opinion

Protecting yourself from possible no-fault divorce causes you a guilty conscience? You people are hilarious. Marriage vows are broken when over 70% of divorces in the US are initiated by women.

Does anyone get married planning on divorce?
I'm talking about basic risk-management. With divorce rates as high as they are, and with how stacked the courts are against the 'breadwinners' (men) of the *economic union* called marriage, shouldn't at least some due diligence further than a coin flip be in place to protect your assets?
Although I do agree op could have done things better- he could have had a prenup made before getting married. Or he could have not got married. Now he's in a bind- the problem with marriage is that it financially incentivises the non-breadwinner to divorce in order to collect assets and alimony. If he's open and honest, it will incentivize the destruction of his *economic union* that can be broken, no-fault, at any time.

In for "the bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:58:02
And I can guarantee op doesn't have any type of prenup in place.
Hey op. Hide 'your' wealth. After a divorce it becomes 'her' wealth.

Troll chat is terrible, but it literally was my first warning to transfer ltc to btc before the mini crash last night. Troll chat is mostly disinformation, but when relevant news is posted like an offical Gox tweet or an Arstech article about a lawsuit, it can greatly aid in making quick market decisions

rule of thumb is only use bank wires for $500 or more. Anything under $500 is cheaper using exchange sites.
