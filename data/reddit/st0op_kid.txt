Hi, quick question.
With your self-directed IRA, is there a hard limit on what you can deposit into it each year? I've been reading $5.5k is the max funding per year.. What if I wanted to invest more than that through this method? Possible or no go?
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:26:21
? Did he send you the private key? 
Otherwise it's just him moving $1 of bitcoin from a wallet he owns to a wallet he owns?
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:44:34
Oh, I'm dense. I totally missed the part where you sent him your own address.   
Nice job wasting their time and getting that $$ out of them!
@_date: 2018-09-02 19:05:23
Thanks for the followup!
So they're most likely using some sort of KYC on binance if they have such a large balance there. Nice work! I'm very curious to see where this goes.

The crypto world is dirty and unregulated. Seek fairness elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-09-01 18:01:14
Don't be ridiculous. Who said they were going withdraw everything in a day? This person held on to 110k coins for 4 years.
I'm sure they can handle a 2BTC / DAY withdrawal limit over the course of a period of time with a sizable number of account. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:20:03
This is some CSI level stuff. 
Obviously if this player dumps all their coins, it'll be a significant impact on the market. 
They could also be setting themselves up for a BAKKT / ETF run and dump into strength.
Also, it could just be a fake out transfer to play the market reactions (I doubt this theory).
@_date: 2018-08-24 19:19:19
No. The user experience of accepting crypto and having cash to pay your bills must be streamlined. 
The majority of merchants won't do this because they don't want to "get technical" or worry about lost keys.  
This is just not an option in the short-term.
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:02:45
I'm going to need to deduct a few street creds from y.... oh, it's a negative balance... nvm.

Spend / rebuy with fiat seems to be a decent strategy.

You sure saved me time. Thanks!

I doubt the alphabet boys would bother obfuscating these coins so heavily if that were so.

Pretty trivial to make as many Binance accounts as you want....

Bitcoin took a huge leap ahead into the P2P payment world. Most people have no idea how to properly utilize it, thus adoption is difficult to achieve.
The truth is, some intermediary party needs to step in to be a middleman for a period of time to hold people's hands and slowly guide them towards this decentralized world. 
Centralized decentralization.
At some point, the need for the 3rd party may dissipate, but it will be up to the market to decide that.
@_date: 2018-08-31 21:24:03
No need friend, I can imagine it all in my head already :)
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:45:52
Ah perfect, my sell signal has arrived.
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:28:55
You're absolutely right. IMHO, at the moment, people who are building applications for bitcoin adoption in the US are STRONGLY hindered by this. 
Here's hoping the IRS exempts bitcoin redemptions under a few hundred dollars from capital gains... I'm curious to see if Sbux &amp; Co will affect that landscape for the better (lobbying, anyone?)
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:08:07
It's an outspoken vocal minority that may feel this way. Anyways, that's completely beyond the point here. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:52:58
How can we add a higher "fee" to our transactions? Moving BTC from my wallet always gives me a static fee that I can't seem to change.
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:12:23


Your skepticism isn't warranted here. Bring forth evidence or it's all hearsay.
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:59:53
Yup, likes on a reddit post on the GLOBAL internet dictate the military/economic strategies of a country. 
Be careful what you like.

Multibit. So, only certain wallets give you this functionality? 
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:39:48
Took a little longer than usual, but got confirmed within an hour. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:56:16
There actually are not. 
Either way, I shouldn't have to think about searching for an in-network ATM. That's an inconvenience that shouldn't exist in this day and age.
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:35:13
Oh boy. I wish you had gone through the escrow sites like I recommended. I imagine you sent your btc directly to him. Rookie mistake, but I bet you won't make it again. Kiss that money goodbye and consider it a lesson.
Welcome to bitcoin, where you're your own bank. Financial institutions have babied you for so long, it's like releasing a zoo-raised monkey into the wild to fend for itself. Don't worry, stick around and you'll eventually learn to be vigilant about guarding your funds and patient in your methods of liquidation. $240 is nothing in the grand scheme of things.
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:36:00
OMG, I FREAKING KNOW RIGHT!?!?!?!? God I hate scammers, they're SCUM.
First of all, [inflation](
For US to US transaction, IMO we don't see much improvement from BTC compared to things like Venmo, PayPal and the like.
But once you start going across borders or working with the unbanked, bitcoin makes a world of a difference. 
Have you ever tried sending money overseas? It's a hassle and it'll cost you around $20 to wire money through a bank if you're lucky. You could hit up money transfer services, but that mean getting off your butt and waiting in line at a walmart or grocery store and paying exorbitant fees. 
If you're lazy like me, you'll want to just be able to do so from your phone or computer. There's a lot more to it, and it takes time to digest it all, so explore around the community for a while.
In a philosophical sense, you could think of it as opening a new world where global commerce is easily accessible. Have we, as a species, been limited in what businesses we pursue because money is expensive to send around the world?
Also, cryptography is a just a fun subject in general. [Check out this video on bitcoin security,]( blew my mind when I first saw it.
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:54:31
Regarding CA AB 1123,
Since it hasn't passed, this means one can start up a business to sell Bitcoins without having to pay the application fee, right? So, no need to get a money transmitter license, but we still need to follow federal rules (FinCEN, etc.)
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:21:11
Oh same. I put a lot of spend on credit cards as well, gotta get those cashback or points! In fact, I used to manufacture spend and churn credit cards just to rack up points for flights and hotels. There'll always be a need for banking institutions, but they need competition in order to motivate themselves to constantly be improving and working for us, instead of using us to get rich off of interest with our collective $$.
I pulled out $40 from an ATM today and was charged a $3 ATM fee. Imagine how many crypto transactions I could make for a $3 fee? Of course, I used a bank which will refund me $15 a month for out of network ATM fees, but not everyone knows these workarounds.
I absolutely agree, many people have gotten suckered in via pure speculation. Time heals all wounds. This is not a short term move for me.
The real gift of crypto comes from global transactions or transactions that need to be settled ASAP. Paying a few cents for near-instant settlements is much more attractive than paying $20 for a wire transfer. 
Merchants whom have to wait days to weeks to get their fiat funds from transactions through typical POS setups gain liquidity from being able to transact in cryptocurrency. No chargeback fraud is icing on the cake, but not a major focus.
Of course, if your end goal is to just convert your crypto to fiat, you're still stuck with the same waiting periods.

Thanks for the reply. 
Will have to get in touch with a lawyer to clarify the money transmitter side of this.
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:49:11
Breakage happens because people deem the value on GCs so low, that it's not worth their time/effort to liquidate them.
You're jumping into a saturated market with no way to differentiate yourself from the competition. 
Maybe if you paid people more BTC than their GCs are worth, you'd stick out, but 70-80% is a joke compared to the current market.
Good luck.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:56:42
I see you've met one of the more.... colorful... characters on the sub. You'll have to excuse him. Some people wear their heart on their sleeve.
You can trade your BTC for paypal mycash (PPMC) cards on localbitcoins or paxful. These sites act as escrow 3rd parties between you and the 2nd party. 
Be aware that some people sell PPMC cards that were fraudulently obtained and if you cash large amounts of those into your PP account, they may shut you down. Just a couple times for small amounts should be fine though.
Look for sellers with long history/good reviews, then google the buyer name to see if any complaints have been made. If they check out, proceed with the trade.
You'll likely be able to get PPMCs for 5-15% off. Don't trust anyone selling for obscenely low discounts (30-50% off), those are obviously frauded cards.
Good luck and welcome to BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:18:58


Agreed. 


Being charged interest for services does not bother me. It's the fact that my money is used in fractional reserve banking and I'll never see a fair share of the pie. 
Most savings account offer less than 1%. Sure, you could find higher interest rates or invest in other financial vehicles, but will the majority of people ever do that? Where is that money going? Certainly not to you or I.


Agree and disagree. Crypto is digital cash, albeit with a young/weak financial infrastructure and low ease-of-use. Given time, it's feasible that crypto can enhance physical cash similar to how the internet enhanced access to information. However, like libraries, cash will always be around.


Definitely the weakest part of crypto, but only if you consider fractional reserve to be the end-all solution. Putting up crypto-related collateral in peer2peer lending is working just fine here. [


Good point, If anything, it'll be FinTechs that push crypto (if they find it useful).


I could see that. Crypto basically requires a review/reputation system, which is more research than the average Joe is willing to do in this day and age.
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:50:47
It's not pretty seeing someone take a hit. It'll happen time and time again as crypto gets more use. Ideally, the next generations will grow up aware of how to navigate these new territories and we'll grow stronger as a species with instant global commerce.
Taking this financial leap is like an animal choosing between living in a comfortable zoo or living in the wild. Pros and cons on both choices, but ultimately, it's up to the individual to decide for themselves. 
I certainly wouldn't be my own doctor, but I'd like to be able to self-diagnose small everyday maladies.

I think Coinbase &gt; anywhere is the issue. They're just being careful over all this fork nonsense (or they want to keep the forked coins...). 
They do give you a 72 hour cancellation window.
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:19:20
Not sure. Are you thinking of doing Coinbase -&gt; gdax? Would be the same case, I suspect. If it's not, let me know! I would love to cancel my transaction and move coins without CB looming over me...
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:34:13
Awesome. I just gave this a short and got funds much quicker. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:57:37
Don't worry, they put a 72 hour delay when you try to transfer them out. It's a love/hate relationship.
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:09:57
Nice video. What cut do you take from transactions?
What sort of verification do users need (ID, SSN, etc.)?
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:56:53
Ah ok,
As long as you're not based in the US, you should be ok. But selling items for BTC has strict regulatory requirements in KYC/AML. So selling BTC for items crosses some gray area boundaries in this region, but again, if not in US, you should be fine.
I'll give your app a try in a week or so. Been stuck with eBay for many years and love the idea of crypto eBay. 
You might need to drop your fee structure a bit to scalp customers from eBay since eBay charges 6-10%, but has a much larger customer base to sell to...
@_date: 2018-07-07 23:30:21
Thanks for the answer. Fees look decent.
Mainly interested in the verification needed to sell/buy items for Bitcoin. 
Do you envision this as crypto eBay?
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:26:28
True, I guess it's during the more volatile movements that the spread gets huge. I couldn't get anything less than $20 over market price (~$360) and all banks were already closed. Today I'm seeing spreads less than $5 while market price is at $390.
Hard to get in, especially for large amounts.
@_date: 2015-11-06 02:54:26
The thing that I don't like about lbc is that you've gotta pay a premium for the most part. Nobody seems to ever want to sell at current market value.

As a plus, adverts will become less and less effective as people will stop being easily persuaded to spend their money on junk.
Not only will we have less ads, but we'll filter out all the bullshit products as well, leaving behind only the best products/services which can compel us to part with our coins.
The future is bright!

Welcome to the wild wild ride of the BTC world.
Taking advice from online strangers is usually never a good idea, but here's mine.
Never put more than you can afford to lose. Don't trade on emotions. You only "lose" your investment if you sell at this point. 
TBH, I'd stay far away from this sub, as there are many people who will blurt out nonsensical answers just to fuel their own agendas. There are some useful tidbits here and there, but oftentimes these are buried between many pump/dump posts.
Read more about bitcoin until you have a good idea of why this may or may not be the next great currency. 
Holding BTC vs fiat alleviates many headaches associated with fiat (Civil asset forfeiture in the US is a recent one that got lots of news). Slow steady inflation of the dollar over its entire history. I imagine the same goes for most Fiat based currency. The ability of a government to print money means inflation will almost always be an issue that the common person can do nothing about. 
 
I personally enjoy being able to transfer large sums of money within an hour for relatively small fees. No other financial institution I've dealt with has ever let me control my money like that. Thus, I believe in BTC and will continue holding.
Do what works for you. 
Good luck.
Edit: This ended up being a little longer than expected.
