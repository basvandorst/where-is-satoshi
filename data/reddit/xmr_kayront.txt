I understand that, and I also would not generalize like that. Plenty of bitcoiners (and I also include myself in that list) realize the big deficiency with the present BTC system in this one area.


This I do not understand. Would you care to expand?
Personally I've been using it myself for years, in the knowledge that I don't have to worry about separating outputs into separate wallets, and possess what essentially is a cash account whose balance only I can see (unless I decide otherwise by sharing a viewkey).
To me that is a very powerful concept!
Although I am a cli wallet user (and yes, I realize, far from the norm), I check out the GUI progress from time to time, *and* get it installed in friends computers and such, and the progress in terms of user-friendliness is undeniable.


Well sure, but once upon a time the same could be said about Bitbuidlers! The whole world was swamped with CentraBank real estate, and now the Bitbudlers have slowly built themselves a beachhead.


Not necessarily, but more and more likely over time. The way I visualize it, the web is tainted and whenever you use it, the taint expands.
This might be an academic point for most people, but imagine for instance that you are a writer who advocates for views that were once common sense but are now seen with great suspicion (just an example, let's not pick on the specifics, we could come up with 100s of examples) .. and you need to pay for your hosting and what not with crypto.
Then there's your real identity, that you want to separate entirely from the writer persona: you know people will attack you as a person, and you know that is besides the point, it is the ideas that should be under discussion, not the person behind writing them.
Knowing what I know about Bitcoin, I would **never** use the same wallet for this. And it's even worse than that, because ok, let's say I keep two wallets now (more backups and more words to memorize, but let's ignore that), where do the funds come from? How do I make sure they are "clean" (guess I've just become a money launderer! yay!) before reaching the two wallets such that there is no association between them?
And you could rightfully say, use Tor, use Wasabi, do this, do that, and yes, if you are very careful, patient (timing analysis is a big issue too), and you really know what you're doing, maybe it's possible.
Or we could just use something that protects our privacy by default.
To me that makes more sense, I don't particularly care what name this idea goes under, and that's all that I'm trying to raise attention to here.


It is possible that we truly differ in this. To me, the mere knowledge that someone is hearing such an intimate act is enough to put my mind working on that inconvenient fact, rather than fully letting go and enjoying the moment.
Furthermore, there are complications: what if you are a gay man in a muslim country for example? Would the risk be worth it then? Knowing that somewhere, someone will one day, at their own leisure, go back in time looking for "bad things". Maybe they find out, maybe they don't .. maybe they throw you off a building, maybe they don't.
I could give a few more examples, but again the specifics don't really matter, I think you get the point; The dangerous thing here is that there is a permanent record being created, which can be unwound/rolled back in time at the leisure of whoever has the reins of power that day.
Such things transcend cryptocurrency, the problem is deeper than that. Ultimately it is the wicked mentality of distrusting everything and everyone by default that must be eradicated, but we can never forget that some people are like that, even if they think they are righteous and are doing the right thing -- history does not bear this out. Absolute power corrupts absolutely, and zero privacy will inevitably lead to total tyranny.
Whatever tools we have at our disposal to avoid that, I'm in.

Maybe, for now.
Are you aware that the EU has flirted with the idea of associating every Bitcoin address with a name?
This would happen through KYC at exchanges, forcing merchants to report transactions amounting to more than $smallish_amount, and so on.
You might say, "this is impossible!", and I am inclined to agree; however, consider that the very fact that they are trying indicates a weakness in the system.
The fact that addresses and amounts involved are public information, forever stored on the immutable ledger we call the blockchain, only makes it worse. 
Now you can use machine learning to automatically pick up "strange" addresses/transactions.
Strange in this context means anything that they don't like, a list that is likely to keep growing appreciably over time. I don't think they will be very keen on sharing the criteria with the rest of us either, as evidenced by all the people here over the years who've had their bank accounts closed. In how many cases did the bank actually come forward and explained exactly why the account was closed?
This is why on-chain privacy is so important.
@_date: 2019-11-09 07:44:09
This is the price we pay for complacency.
I [wrote about this WARNING needs Tor Browser]( back in April.
KYC is cancer, you must understand the mentality of these people - made abundantly clear here: if they cannot see it, then it must be bad, and you must be breaking the law.
Not questioning this logic will **inevitably** lead to our downfall and enslavement: to a government not of the people and for the people, but above the people, omnipresent and unchallengeable.
That way, it should go without saying, lies tyranny and slavery - your every move, your every purchase forever stored in some state database.
It seems we have learned nothing from the crimes of the last century and the immense costs measured in human suffering that comes from the state engulfing all spheres of private life.
**This has nothing to do with 'fighting money laundering' or 'fighting terrorism'**. Don't you see?
Just a day or two ago there was a thread here (couldn't find the link, unfortunately) about some Spanish guy who got hounded by his bank for an inbound 100€ transfer from another country: the bank automatically suspected him, and started asking all sorts of questions and requesting all sorts of documents.
**Who can you terrorize with 100€** ? 
We must be proactive, and we must exercise our hard-won **right for privacy** en-mass. **While we still can**.
One day (and that day has come in several countries around the world) the police will come knocking on your door if you are doing anything to obfuscate your Internet traffic (tor, vpn), or if you are obfuscating your transactions (Monero, etc).
One day, paying in cash will no longer be allowed, so that the state can have a permanent record of all your transactions conveniently available at the bank. So that you have nowhere to hide.
One day, privacy will be a crime. And then, at last, the horrors of the Soviet and the Nazi regimes will once again be enacted.
The thinking goes like: "**If we cannot see this, it is because this person is taking deliberate steps to hide from us, which means there is something nefarious going on, because we have the right to peer into anyone's life at any and all times at our discretion**.
Why do you think these monsters always strip people of their privacy?
**People with zero privacy are very easy to control**.
They become afraid of standing out, of doing something they suspect will bring the wrath of the authorities on them.
If you don't do your part to stop this. Stop using the stupid plastic card for every purchase, use cash. Get that crappy facebook/google/bigtechcompanydujour crap out of your mobile phone. Switch to open-source software.
The writing is on the wall, if only you are willing to look at it.
Take a few hours to contemplate the horrors of the past and vow to not let them be repeated in the future. Because right now, very clearly, we are headed there at lightning speed.
For now, there is still time.
Wake up.

Imagine you are on the market for a new flat.
Bitbuidlers, Inc builds wonderful family-sized units, with a modern design, but all their stuff comes with microphones and cameras that broadcast to no one in particular, but in all directions at once, for no reason in particular.
Montero &amp; Monroe, on the other hand, is a newer company whose core belief is that no matter the fact that we are living in an increasingly digital age, what you do and say in your own home should not be broadcast to the world in real time for all to see, analyze, and perhaps exploit.
Some time goes by.
You gotta give it to Bitbuidlers, the new construction techniques employed in their flats nearly a decade ago unleashed a revolution in the real estate market that only but a few reitpunks could have foreseen.
However there is that small detail with the microphones and cameras constantly broadcasting. Actually, it's worse than that. Another property of Bitbuidlers design is that everything ever said and done inside their flats is perpetually stored all over redundant storage in their many units around the world.
Certain people try to raise some objections. "Is it really wise to be recording everything that people do and say in the privacy of their homes?"
"Privacy is dead bro!", they say.
"We have nothing to hide, what is the problem?", others retort.
Soon, new laws are passed. Unless you are the scum of the earth you don't believe nor practice domestic violence, and so to argue against KYN/ADV (Know Your Neighbor / Anti Domestic Violence) laws would be to invite unwanted attention.
The police might, after all, believe you are a woman launderer.
A few rational people here and there wonder out loud whether it really is a good idea to foment a pattern in society where you are always guilty until proven innocent, and where the only way to prove your innocence is by having everything you do and say (and to some extent, think) stored in a permanent record.
Not so many listen to these people. The real estate market has been booming, and people are purchasing Bitbuidlers units like mad -- "the microphones will sort themselves out!"
Meanwhile, on the other side of the pond, Montero &amp; Monroe's trusty customers wonder, sometimes out loud, why on earth one would invite the surveillance state into the living room.
Granted, many people have done so already with Google assistants and what not, but that is not much different from billions of mostly tech-illiterate people donating all their information to facebook, only to realize about 15 years in that they've been had.
Perhaps 30 minutes of thinking about the implications in the beginning might've helped.
So Montero &amp; Monroe's customers live a bit happier in the knowledge that no no no, there is no reasonable reason for FLATanalysis companies to monitor everything they do and say for wrongthink. In fact, they seem pretty certain that only a power-hungry totalitarian piece of sh*it would even dare to suggest this. 
To protect the women, of course. And by extension, the children. And since they can see everything now, there won't also be any drugs. Or terrorism.
Perfect, no?
Some of Montero &amp; Monroe customers also live with the uneasy sensation that this whole loss of privacy thing is rapidly becoming normalized, and that unless the trend is reversed, one day the police might come knocking on their door -- they cannot hear what they say and do inside their homes -- unlike 99% of blockflat designs out there now, so clearly they *could be* pedos, batterers, and god knows who else.
It is with some disbelief that they see this sort of reasoning going around unchallenged, and it is with great concern that they see high "authorities" peddling this crap: "We must  or we can't catch the bad guys!"
**tl;dr**: UTXO hygiene is hiring a physicist and mathematician to create complex, failure-prone schemes to work around the fact that the flat you purchased is rigged with microphones and cameras. Eventually you realize this and realize that it is perhaps not such a good idea that anyone with the right gear can listen to everything you say and do in the privacy of your own home, and rather than correcting the root problem (move to a place without microphones and cameras?) you devise failure-prone schemes that take time, money, and require additional tech knowledge that few people have or are willing to have, in order to "fix" the problem.

That is a very good analogy actually, in the sense that as things stand today (because the base layer has little privacy baked in on the Internet) then using Tor is often enough grounds to raise suspicion.
Not only from utterly paranoid intelligence agencies, that as we well know in 2019 do routinely add your IP to a list of "people of interest" for using Tor (this is related to erosion of privacy and the default assumption that unless the state can pierce through everything you do, you are probably up to no good, which is a very problematic way of thinking, I hope that is self-evident for more and more people as time goes on).
For example, have you tried using Tor for accessing online banking ? I've had more than a few accounts red-flagged back in the day for this.
(And yes, I think it is a perfectly rational thing to do, the bank already knows so much, why give them a physical location every time we log-in?)
Because everything is transparent by default, those looking for privacy are seen with suspicion. That's part of it, the other and in this case probably bigger part is that so few people know about Tor, that most logins over Tor to bank accounts are likely fraud.
What is common to all these situations? The fact that transparency by default means that savvy users who would like to preserve their privacy can easily be singled out.
**However** I will not argue that moving to LN is, in privacy terms, light years ahead of transacting on the BTC base chain.
But I do wonder on one hand what sort of pitfalls there are that we don't understand well enough yet, and on the other hand as far as I understand the LN as it stands right now, whatever privacy we have there is completely dependent on nodes along the path not colluding to unmask the source.
Considering that most routes seem to use well-worn paths, this could become a concern, especially when the usual suspects realize this fact and, uhm, *convince* the big LN routers to stream that information to a centralized database.

Unfortunately such opinions are a very tiny minority right now.
We [have the tools]( to move things in this direction though - but I suspect that a lot more average people will have to be burned before they realize, viscerally, why ceding so much power to a giant bureaucratic centralized organization that tramples on everyone's privacy for its own gain and is largely unaccountable in how they spend *our* money to enlarge itself is a bad idea.
I just hope that we can bounce back from that. I wish that people start paying attention to how they are manipulated by fear and half-truths ("if we don't monitor every single financial transaction out there, the terrorists will get you!") into losing their freedoms.
But anyway - really enjoyed reading your post.

Sorry for the late reply, but here goes.
Security through obscurity is only a bad way to do security if it is your *only* way to do security.
A good defense-in-depth strategy, when possible, also ought to include the obvious point that if you are not visible, then you cannot be targeted.
This does not mean that if you are somehow spotted, then there are no protections. I hoped that would be very self-evident.
Simply, it means that you do not announce yourself: "hey hey, here here! I have half a million in crypto, here's my name and my address!"
And that is why KYC is so dangerous for crypto. Once the databases start getting hacked and sold underground (and they will, the concentration of all that high-return information in a few centralized parties will ensure that), then truly criminal elements will start being able to very effectively target crypto-wealthy people.
Who will have no recourse, especially in the case of Monero, since chain analysis is by design impossible to perform.

No freedom without privacy, banks gonna bank, governments gonna government, regulation is a trap, get your friends in on this stuff *yesterday*

This is a good book, easy to understand for beginners and seasoned hodlers alike.
I've personally donated about 8 copies of the book to friends who had heard about crypto but were not really into it since learning about the book from the [Tales From the Crypt Podcast]( and every single time it worked to deepen their curiosity about bitcoin/crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-23 10:10:02
Of course they are, but not willingly.

It never seems to cross their minds that perhaps the people they supposedly represent would very much prefer to transact peacefully between themselves without a paranoid, insecure, uninvited giant bureaucracy forcibly becoming part of the equation.
Funny, isn't it?
**"The anonymity of virtual currencies allows their potential misuse for criminal purposes."**
Well.. the anonymity of internet communication allows potential misuse for criminal purposes as well. Are we to ban end-to-end encryption and have the state sit happily between our most intimate conversations as well?
Or, given recent developments to install 3G/4G connections in every new car sold in the EU (not optional, by the way - look up the "e-call" system.. they got your back on this one too), it could equally be argued that if you opt out of permanent tracking by cell towers, then surely this "allows for the potential misuse for criminal purposes".. because only a criminal would be bothered by being tracked 24/7, and having a microphone that may or may not be on at all times of the day.. right? 
These loons see privacy and anonymity as "an issue" and yet don't seem to realize that a healthy FREE SOCIETY needs both to survive.
The truth seems a lot simpler to me than what those convoluted documents appear to imply - they simply have recognized that the cows are growing wings through technologies such as end-to-end encryption and cryptocurrency, and specifically privacy-preserving cryptocurrency.
Although it was not that long ago that the state simply did not have the ability to perform mass-surveillance as it does today (only a few decades), they have become very used to this superpower.
Now that technology is once again levelling the playing field, they resort to foul play - branding anyone who wants privacy a criminal, guilty by default; attempting to outlaw good privacy-preserving technology, and lying about the reasons, when the real reason is good old self-preservation; and endangering life and property (KYC, and forced disclosure of crypto addresses, which end up in centralized databases, which eventually gets hacked (equifax? cambridge analytica? facebook? national bank of qatar? .. and so on), which eventually means your photo, your home address and the value of your crypto holdings ends up for sale on the black market, at which point good luck with everything and hope you have a gun) -- for selfish reasons.
When is enough enough?
@_date: 2019-04-14 09:25:51
And where exactly is the law that states that every cash transaction must be associated with real identities?
Of course, the resident tyrants would very much like such a law. But it does not exist yet.
Also, the Internet is far more than just a public space. It's the domain of the imagination, of thought, of ideas.
If you can't see the problem with regulating thoughts and ideas even before they materialize, I'm not quite sure how to convince you that only a totalitarian police state would attempt to do so.

**As u/Michielbtc said, this is why KYC should be stopped immediately**.
Most people don't see the writing on the wall. And the corrupt politicians who happen to depend on your tax dollars (satoshis?) either are too ignorant to run the 2-3 steps necessary to reach the consequences or plainly don't care, for they have a MASSIVE conflict of interest here.
(NOTE: Above sentence does *not* imply that taxes are bad and/or that you should avoid them while using crypto)
**It is already bad enough** that wealthy people are *forced* to disclose their assets to what essentially amounts to the biggest, meanest, usually-money-hungry predator out there - I speak of the state, if there is any doubt.
If you doubt this, I suspect it is only because you have not experienced wealth yourself.
There are *many* wealthy people who dress just like you, don't live in mcmansions, and are pretty humble people. They live very unassuming lives. **They realize that unfortunately wealth, like other good fortunes, brings negative emotions such as envy** from other, less-well-off people, who more or less believe their destinies to be fixed, and life unfair.
The crucial difference is the **peace of mind** that knowing one's family is covered in any financial eventuality for years and years in the worst case scenario; That while in the end we may all die, whilst in this material realm our basic survival needs are met, and we can then focus on higher things.
**Unfortunately, that peace of mind is severely brought down** when, under the threat of violence and imprisonment, wealthy people are forced to disclosure their assets.
From corrupt government officials with connections to crime, to simply envious people who don't think you have a right to have more than them (oh, plenty of that going around nowdays..), and indeed, feel themselves **entitled** to *your* money..
There are certain forces in society today that abhor success, distinction above one's peers. Everything and everyone must be *equal*, which from Communist and Socialist societies (ask anyone who's lived under such a regime) we understand to mean: **equally poor**. And so an attempt is made to push the more successful in society towards the average.
This may all seem very academic and perhaps irrelevant - which it isn't, because such things have consequences down the line, whether you are wealthy yourself or not.
But consider this - if this Bitcoin / crypto thing is going anywhere, then even today all of us are *very early* to the game, if we zoom out 10, 20 or 30 years.
That means - unless you royally screw things up by letting your emotions dictate your (trading) behavior, there's a decent chance that **one day, you too will be very wealthy**.
It is, therefore, in your selfish best interest - if nothing more - to pay close attention now to what the people who make mandatory asset disclosure laws have in mind for you in the future.
And it is in your best selfish interest to think through the consequences of having your name, face, address, addresses and total quantity of cryptoassets plastered all over some KYC exchange, who then by law has to send it to yet another centralized place (because terrorists), which will then retain this information for essentially forever (at this point an intelligence agency has likely obtained a copy of the information already, don't worry) and somehow magically in the middle of all that, everyone has perfect security and their servers are never breached.
Given the many scandals of recent years - from the shadowbrokers hacking the treasure trove of the NSA itself, to the Bulgarian Tax Agency recently having lost the records of millions of taxpayers to hackers, to the National Bank of Qatar having been hacked, to Cambridge Analytica, to the Yahoo! mail mass-pwnage (etc, etc, etc), it seems to me that there is a very fair chance that one day, your picture, address and crypto amount owned is floating around the dark web.
Thick politicians will of course at that point suggest that we "ban the dark web" or "make selling stolen ID documents illegal" or "end anonymity online" or "ban theft and murder".
That's just what criminals do, isn't it? You pass a law and suddenly they stop.... not.
The problem isn't the dark web or any of these things, as adults on Earth we know very well that there are some genuinely bad people out there who would not hesitate to extinguish your life in order to benefit financially from it.
The way to protect ourselves against such immoral people is *not* to hum along as we are forced to dox ourselves to use this new technology. The problem was giving the information to some "trusted" party (*or else*, I hear the State saying in the background) in the first place - it was completely unnecessary, and in fact runs completely counter to the spirit of crypto.
**Cryptocurrency is fundamentally different** in that it is a *bearer asset*. If a thief forces you at gunpoint to transfer $20k from your online bank, even if you don't have footage of the event, you stand a very good chance - at least in the developed world - to recover your money; and because of the surveillance-friendly nature of that system, it is easy to obtain clues to launch an investigation and bring the thief to justice.
Crypto, especially non-transparent chains, is nothing of the sort.
Even on transparent chains, if you know what you are doing and you have the patience to slowly mix/and-or open lightning channels as time goes by, there is little chance to be caught.
**That is a major difference, and it requires different security precautions**.
As so many people correctly pointed out, **the best defense is indeed not talking about how much crypto one has** - if you're invisible, you can't be targeted!
Maybe one day this changes when almost everyone has some crypto, and even then targeting crypto bil/millionaires is likely to remain profitable.
Until then, think long and hard about this stuff, because it is very important - unless you're here to flip a quick profit and go back to fiat, these matters should concern you.
Remember that in the end, we still live in more or less free countries, and if a decent amount of people are against such laws, they will be repealed.
It isn't inevitable, and it isn't hopeless. By thinking that it is hopeless, you make it so.
