Still you've yet to defend your position with anything other than saying that my arguments are invalid. I've not said anything contradictory. I'm just explaining how it works. There's no 360. You keep trying to point out that bitcoin's supply isn't limited, and yet it's a known fact that it is. So that's why I'm now asking you what makes you think it's not limited. Before,I thought you just didn't understand what gives bitcoin value, but now I realize that you don't understand that it is actually limited. It's a bad thing to not be limited because the supply directly affects the value, and if the value is being manipulated outside market forces then that's a bad thing. Especially when banks have significant influence on the government.

Explain to me how bitcoin's supply is not limited. It's written in the code.

Okay so if there's no expectation of what it should be, then what's the problem? If being based on something tangible isn't a requirement for, say the US dollar, and there's no problem with that, then I don't see how it should be a problem for any other currency. Crypto or not. Can you explain?

You're missing the big difference here though. And it's the reason crypto is becoming so trusted. It's that there's no one group (federal reserve) that chooses what the value/supply is at any given time with no input from everyone who uses the currency. With crypto, you know the supply and the growth of the supply from the beginning with no chance of changing without a fork. Only thing left is for the value to adjust with the market.

What would it be based on? Gold? We're not on the gold standard our fiat currency isn't based on anything either. The only reason we're only buying it with other currencies is because it's not easy to get a job that pays you in crypto
