At the moment, and probably for the rest of this year at least, Bitcoin is not a crypto currency. It is a crypto store of value.
Lightning Network is on the way but I would be surprised if it completely solves the high transaction fees, and the [currently slow] speed with which transactions are conducted, anytime soon.

Hi all, this is not specifically about Bitcoin but I am posting it here as a heads up cautious tale for anyone considering talking about how and where they store their Bitcoin. Don't tell anyone. EVER.
Stay safe out there, Bitcoiners!

Only Bitcoin Cash, as they are about to actively marketing themselves as "Bitcoin" in an attempt to become the cryptocurrency that people associate with that name. Worse still, they are selling "Bitcoin" (which is a big deal considering the are one of the top websites in the world that people are directed to when searching for "bitcoin").
Up until the point that they began dropping the word "Cash" and marketing themselves and selling coins as just "Bitcoin" I did not consider it an issue anymore than I consider Bitcoin Gold and Diamond to be an issue (which I don't, because the names are distinct). In other words, as long as the names were distinct and different I didn't have a problem with it. 
But once they began selling coins as "Bitcoin" and those who purchased Bitcoin Cash thinking they were getting Bitcoin started to pop up, it became clear to me that legally they could be stopped.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:05:51
Currently Bitcoin is best viewed as a store of value (like gold), and not a currency unless the transaction abount is quite large (large enough to merit the high transaction fees). 
At some unspecified time in the future this may change thanks to Lightning Network and/or Segwit.
Until then it is probably best not to use Bitcoin as currency unless you're making very large purchases.

My mistake, everyone. That should have said 4 HOURS from, *NOT* 3 !
Moments ago Bitcoin Futures opened on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBPE). What impact will this have on the price of Bitcoin? There have been any number of speculators speculating on the speculation. Imagine that.
In 4 hours we will know the person who got closest to predicting the price of Bitcoin at the end of today, Sunday at 10pm Eastern Time, which is several hours after Futures will have been open (giving enought time for a solid run, long enough to impact the price).
There is still time to place your bet, or make a wild guess, in the following discussion. Check back in 4 hours to see who wins the pot of gold:

Right about now wouldn't be a bad idea to buy in at, maybe spending half of what you have. It's pretty low right now, but might go even lower which is why I recommend not spending everything at the moment.
Spend a lot of time educating yourself on the ups and downs of the price, so you have a good idea what to expect. Up-and-down is the name of the game, so try to catch it when it's down and buy in then.
Also, do not create too much. The fees will eat you alive over time, and you will almost never make as much as if you just bought low and hold on to what you have.
Also, be extremely patient once you have bought in. Don't get nervous and sell when the price isn't going in the direction that you want.
Good luck!

Hold up! I am new to Lighning Network, just getting my arms around it. There will be a *fee* to use it, or is the $$$ you mention simply the funds placed into a channel for spending  (meaning 100% of the funds place in the channel actually get to the person you intend them to go to, and not to pay fees).
If there actually is a fee to use Lightning Network is that on top of the usual Bitcoin transaction fee as well?
With thanks for any help you can give me as I learn more about LN!  :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:12:10
If it wasn't obvious that other cryptocurrencies do not have the same transaction fee overhead this would be a reasonable argument. However, in the face of the facts there is no good reason that Bitcoin transaction fees should be so high. Justifying them only delays solutions.

Ah, Monero. I did a quick Google search and it looks like this is a Monero miner, which means you will probably never be able to find out much about anything since Monero is one of the few "privacy" cryptocurrencies out there.
I would suggest joining the Monero subreddit, if there is one, and posting there. Or join a more Monero  community or forum.
Developers and users with Monero experience can tell you a lot more than I can, but I don't have a particularly good feeling about your being able to track down what happened once the mining occurred since you are dealing with a crypto that is designed to hide such details.
Good luck!!

First-mover advantage gave Bitcoin a giant lead in infrastructure and adoptio. But it will not last forever. To be specific: If the outrageous transaction fees and speed of transactions are not addressed Bitcoin will eventually give way to other cryptos.
I am a believer that these will be addressed, but I don't know if it will be in time.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:19:00
If you provide the identifier here someone might be able to determine what it actually is. There are a variety of blockchain explorers that you can find on the internet or you can plug in addresses for specific types of cryptos. You can try those as well.
What makes you think it was a wallet ID? Did it say so in the code?

Could you please point me towards the core road map? As far as I understood there is no road map, which could be part of the problem.

If there is indeed a Bitcoin core roadmap would you mind providing link so I can take a look?

There is no Bitcoin Core roadmap. This is a major shortcoming in my opinion, one I hope will be addressed soon.
The best you will find are some developer discussions and the code, but these fall very short of an actual development roadmap.

The original vision of its creator, and for its initial years, was exactly that (i.e., a cryptographically secure means for purchasing anything digitally, coffee or otherwise). 
It's called crypto *currency* for a reason. 
If everyone is fine with Bitcoin not being useful as a currency we should stop calling it cryptocurrency and start  calling it cryptostoreofvalue

It started as a currency, lost its value as a currency, and the hope is it will return to that original focus. I believe it will, of course, but the real question is *why* has it taken so long to address fundamental infrastructure issues that other cryptos have clearly handled with ease.
As a result of the delays we now have multiple forks of Bitcoin, which do nothing to help the argument that this process should take more time.

I used to trust McAfee because of his business background, but because of the ICOs he has been promoting  (which he proudly admits he is paid to promote) I have lost all respect and believe he may be driving himself into serious legal peril. Here is just one or many examples (I posted this yesterday after doing just a modest amount of due diligence on his new Knowledge.io ICO):
John McAfee has sent out a few tweets from his official "officialmcafee" about an ICO that he just became an advisor of. He has joined the  Knowledge.io "Knowledge Token" ICO that started today, but he may not realize that the individual behind the ICO was recently indicted and arrested on 29 federal charges. 
The FBI and USA Attorney General are leading the federal case, for which a surprising amount of public records are available.
According to   (the educational non-profit that owns the"Knowledge Token" trademark) public records indicate that the individual responsible for the ICO's unauthorized use of the "Knowledge Token" trademark was just indicted by the United States Department of Justice on 29 federal charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, and currently stands accused of defrauding a health clinic out of $2.8 million.
I don't have a Twitter account, but would love to see his response when he realizes that he might end up on the wrong side of the federal government over this and other coins he pumps (and in his most recent Knowledge.io ICO tweet he is very clear about the fact that he is paid a substantial amount of money to promote this ICO).

The best way to deal with that is to simply exchange the Bitcoin for Fiat (US Dollar, Euro, etc) the moment it is received. That is how a lot of vendors guard against volatility.

Edit: I meant to reply to the person who said that it was possible to hack the exchanges but replied too quickly so this reply of mine is now is out of line :(

Hmmmmmmmm... honor and integrity. It's on. I have us at less than  $5k at some point within 1 week of this chat.

I've heard a few saying it will drop below 3K in November due to the fork. Wishful thinking?

I won't put any Bitcoin on the line, that would be fun but crazy. I believe it will go down below 5K within one week, you believe it will stay above 5K for at least one week. Fair enough on both counts. Time will tell. I'll see you in one week! Or less ;)  Babs
