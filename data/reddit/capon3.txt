The problem isn't with following the money. The problem is who is going to enforce anything if you do? At least if a bank is robbed the FBI will follow the number on the stolen bank notes and finally arrest the thief. If you steal bitcoins, follow it on the blockchain and watch as it gets washed traded etc. What happens at the end? You show up at the dudes house with a gun? That's the problem I have..

Really?! Morinic question?? Cause I didn't know what the other replies brought up. About it not being able to be spent etc. Just cause you "might" think to have all the knowledge in the world pertaining to bitcoins doesn't mean the rest of us do!

That's the main problem with crypto currencies. Everyone wants a free way to send, receive payments, keep the banks, the governments, the wealthy at bay. The downfall with that is greed and criminals. There's no system in place to hold those people accountable.

I mine, not much but I do. I enjoy it. I love the idea of crypto currencies. But as bitcoins continue there rise in popularity, the flaws in the system start to really show. Me personally, I don't trust anyone running a pool, an exchange etc. When I mine, I take my coins out of the pool in a day. When I trade, I send the exchange my coins, make the trade, then withdrawal. Until the people running everything associated with cryptos is held accountable for there actions, I will go on not trusting them..

Well, what exactly are you doing now? What's your setup? What program you using to mine?

My post wasn't about it being important and about everyone taking about it. Only if anyone is actually surprised by this news?

If your mining bitcoins with even the greatest of AMD cards you won't get anything for a very very very long time. Mine anything else but BTC, like Litecoin, Reddcoin, Dogecoin, etc.
Also are you sure your doing it right? CGminer etc?

Yea I know. But now I hope they get taken down by someone in Europe. U would figure a site promoting Torrents would be more open minded. There loss.
 I forget that most these sites are run by 11 year olds that never leave there crawl space.
