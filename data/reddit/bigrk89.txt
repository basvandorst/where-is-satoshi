normally I send the Public key + the QR via. E-Mail or Messenger.
There are different types of ATM at some you get a paper wallet which you should import too your Bitcoin wallet. Ledger Wallet don't support this feature :( but many other apps / wallets can do that. 
Other ATM scan your Public Key (QR Code) and send the Bitcoin too it.
I use Mycelium bitcoin wallet for my everyday stuff and have like 50 € on it too spent. There you can also import Privat Keys. And the coins I want to save I send to my Ledger Wallet.
Coinkite+Ledger is a good idea. You can use it alone and sign all transactions (you don't need a partner). You just need to do a few more steps to spend your coins and make it so impossible (really hard) for someone to steal your coins:)

I don't have much Bitcoins :) I store the one I want too keep on a paperwallet :) and the rest (around 5 Bitcoins) are for use so I have them on various online wallets :) Because I like to try them out too see wich one is the best for me. Like greenaddress, blockchain, circle, cubits, coinkite, coinbase  etc.

The most problem is that Bitcoin needs more work to make it popular :)
