I have Wells Fargo. There shouldn't be issues. Coinbase-to-bank transactions or vise versa take days though. This is a very common problem with banks.

That's exactly what online subscriptions should offer, payment upfront with a discount for bitcoin users. This recurring payment thing is an obstacle for online retailers that have memberships, like Birchbox, LootCrate, Netflix, etc. I'd love to see BitPay come up with a solution like this.

I get a lot of my paycheck in bitcoin. Helps with groceries and stuff. It's convenient.
I also generally enjoy shopping with merchants that embrace innovation. It's like we have this common interest. 
There's also the idea that a healthy marketplace protects the value of the currency that fuels it, so I'm just doing my part. 
Also, I want to be my own bank.

That sucks! I thought the food was delicious.  Hoping more bitcoin accepting restaurants happen in New Orleans... A variety is always nice.

CES this week.. Tues-Fri in Las Vegas
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:13:13
Great news! The yBitcoin team has a fantastic product, and I'm excited to see them expanding into other media. With the Bitcoin Magazine brand, there's a lot they can do towards education and effectively providing industry insight.

Thanks for posting.. Boarding my flight now for CES, and this made my morning.

Gem is still building on and contributing to the growth and success of the bitcoin blockchain, and we owe much of our traction and current success to our bitcoin clients and community of developers. Gem is a middleware provider, and like many middleware companies, we started out with a bitcoin API before expanding our offerings to explore other blockchains, including private chains. We're excited for the future of bitcoin technology as well as for new iterations that inevitably will follow.

I think that's the takeaway. Bitcoiners are their favorite customers. They spend more per order, and they are likely to be repeat shoppers. That fact alone makes bitcoin users an attractive demographic.

I'm also interested in seeing a source for this. I'm assuming the OP is referencing BitPay's blog post yesterday: [
The first chart shows 102,221 transactions in Europe alone in the last quarter. Their past 6 months are more than double what OP is stating according to this...

Excited to see this is out! It works like a charm too. It took me less than 3 minutes to set up a 2-of-3 wallet and test a tx the first time I tried it. With the "policy engine" in place, it feels really smart. Great job, guys!

Sweet! Way to go, Tony!

[Update]: Sad day! JBoss is out of the race after a nasty crash early on. Next time though. Thanks for the support!

It looks like you can plan ahead for that reason. A one-time checkout for when it's convenient and affordable. They have a subscription model or one-time purchase at an additional cost. They know bitcoin users arent ideal "subscribers" for services like this, so they give a promo code for nixing the one-time cost for bitcoin checkout.

ChangeTip, BitPay and Bitcoin Magazine are teaming up to support the race, driver and curious NASCAR fans on Twitter and Reddit. Follow  on Twitter for live updates during the race.

This is a good point. A lot of journalists and reporters can't accept payment, so redirecting tips sent to them for good content is a nice work around.

Congrats on rolling this out! What perfect timing, too! It's been a good week for Bitcoin.
