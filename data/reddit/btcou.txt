Okay well can that do music too? Can it do everything? lol
That is literally exactly what I am talking about but its half the puzzle. What I am saying as well is that my document or file should not be allowed to be shared without certain terms I set... Like music (best example) should not be allowed to be played without a fee of my choice

Way to be, thank you.

I used to play games, I do not anymore though. But you can aimbot on platforms such as XB1? Like Halo 5?

Okay...you all have been VERY VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU ALL OF YOU
but...i am trying to download core on my laptop I use for school....its not gonna work
How do i export the bitcoins that have not arrived on here, to a different wallet if they haven't downloaded yet??
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:06:40
Got the priv key, now how on earth do i "import" them?
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:36:32
does this 60 GB save on your computer software? Will it slow my PC down?
@_date: 2015-12-24 22:59:34
I'll start with the obvious, this looks like a simple USB drive. I'll then move on to the blatant: What is this? I'm then gonna sneak into the, "What do you use this for, and how may it benefit me personally?"

This has been a truly awful experience. My computer is literally stuck 2 years away from ever getting my Bits. MultiBit is just as confusing and there is no way to "Import Priv Key" and CoinBase doesn't have that option either. Where is the user friendliness? This is madness, I just want my bits??? Please anyone, anyone help me out. My computer is moving at the speed of dogshit as its trying to download 3 years of bank statements essentially, and to get my money I have to take 4 classes in Computer Science to understand dick about it. Fuck this
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:38:20
so this all saves to my computer??? Why on earth would I want 60 GB of data saving on my daily computer? Its gonna slow it down...
@_date: 2015-12-21 11:22:40
What is "debug console program"
@_date: 2015-12-25 21:39:43
We came to this nation due to government doing exactly that, and we couldn't vote there. Now we can vote, and the same stuff is happening and you refuse to vote? I don't follow.

To give some insight as to why they close accounts with multiple thousands of dollars.....
As a user you a guaranteed to be restored (in the case of a hack or exploit which causes you to lose your BTC) the AVERAGE AMOUNT OF BTC THE AVERAGE COINABLE CUSTOMER HAS IN THEIR ACCOUNT
they are not backed by the FDIC, and the wording in their insurance is to reward you with the average BTC. Sooooo if someone or someone(s) has a lot of money stored on CoinBase it raises the average BTC in peoples wallets making them more liable

Example on how "MultiBit HD" is not user friendly. I google "how to import priv key multiunit" Instructions are shown as:If you have a MultiBit Classic private keys export file you can re-import them into a MultiBit Classic wallet. To import the private keys into a wallet, do the following: In the ' Wallets' side panel choose the wallet you want to import the private keys into. Select the menu option 'Tools.
YET: Sidepanel Interface:
1. Send Request
2. Payments
3. Contacts
4. Help
5. Pref.
6. Manage Wallet &gt; Edit, Empty, Dashboard, Repair, Change, PMTS **NONE ARE "TOOLS"** so frustrating
7. Tools
8. Exit/Switch
I can't select a wallet and press tools. It can't be done.

Gotta have support and a body of people fighting with you or you won't make a splash enough for them to listen.
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:06:11
Okay once I have my priv key what do I do with it? 
Every other wallet says send our receive but NONE of them say "Import priv Key here"
@_date: 2015-12-25 23:29:25
I don't know how one could say usage does not cause price spikes...
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:28:01
Can you please elaborate on dumpprivkey? I am a finance guy, not a tech wizard, like you guys are, Harry.
Seriously Hermoine or Ron will you explain to me this mysterious dumppriv? I wanted a secure wallet so that I could be a tank guarding my precious bits.

Okay so I don't know if this is the academic direction your looking for because of your major...BUT
One of the hardest things to do in accounting is to determine depreciation. If you could come up with a technology that adds items to the blockchain, for instance
I buy a House for 100,000 in Idaho in 2000
You could create an app that "Folders" this house into a section, with comparative "Cost of Living" areas in the US. Also comparative square foot. Anything I add on to the house or build on, gets added to my House details
Then when I want to sell my house, I can go to this Folder and look at what similar houses in similar areas are selling for since their market price. This could be useful for cars, computers, etc. 
In my opinion that would really help gauge an assets value
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:24:49
Laugh all you want. As a college kid I hadn't saved a penny til I learned about this area of finance. Getting their money out of cash and into a portfolio is the way to spark savings interest (both literally and figuratively) in my own opinion 
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:40:00
And THAT is what I am struggling with. I want to yell at the top of my lungs that these corporations are vial creatures that destroy the earth and are not self sustaining, yet who am I. Without my local corporate chain of super markets I would starve to death.
@_date: 2016-05-21 13:56:11
I agree. but the problem is law literature is severely far behind in all of this. Smart contracts are AMAZING in what they can do for this sort of thing, but the literature has to come up with the legal terms and conditions first so to speak
@_date: 2016-05-12 23:43:45
For the last year or so I have become less and less "fluent" on bitcoin so you will have to bear with me. But it was to my knowledge that in order for bitcoin to thrive as an e-currency, or an e-gold (which is so naturally does very well) the blocks would have to be split or forked or what not. The last I heard was that if mainstream acceptance does happen, the structure that bitcoin is built upon as of now would NOT allow for fast transactions due to overloading the system or what not. So if the bit has to be split (poetry) wouldn't the price "suffer" by splitting with it?

Think: Yield is determined by the amount invested. If the amount invested is $5,000, then.....And profits would be weighted, obviously to the proportion of money invested.
@_date: 2016-05-21 13:59:56
Enter in: Smart Contract Law. If anyone has ever read a Loan Agreement or a Promissory Note they know how many covenants and restrictions apply. A smart contract would be able to not release funds, not allow voting power, etc etc. Unless all the covenants had been met. Therefore if someone breaks the law, they lose their right to be an owner. And ripping someone off is not limited to the internet my friend :) Banks and CC do it every day !! so do VC! and Crowdfunding sites ! And my parents ! And my dog ! And this Hasbro toy I bought yesterday!

This was our revolution lol. This is our democracy that we voluntarily allowed to create a greedy profit machine. Our actions have fueled it. We sat by as the government allowed big business to gain control over the system and we elected to give them our money as well.
@_date: 2016-05-21 13:57:50
WRONG. I believe in a good government, by your stance then NO public works programs would exist. Public works programs normally operate with a loss in income, but the government keeps them going. No rationale person would do this, unless they were unlike the rest of the world and didn't just care about a bottom line.
And I agree with the rest of your statement :)

1. I imagine everyone that owned stock in the DOW Jones hated the theory of the S&amp;P, only to find they truly move in unison together and there is no competition. So, to further on your (Great) answer, can there be both? Or must the world choose? Bit or Eth!
2. Exchange / Wallet, Fish / Shark same thing!! Haha, I know what you are saying. So essentially use exchanges to simply buy the BIT and get them the fugggofff onto your laptop!
3. ** Nods head like he completely understands, understanding less than 0% nonetheless ** Yep, Yep that seems right, yep
4. Damn special thieves.
5. hahahah touche
6. Ahh yes, Paper wallets how totally 1990 **Still nodding head from

In terms of my hope of attaining individual financial prosperity without feeding a moral-less beast, yes I am defeated.
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:37:24
I am not investing. Like I said, I have flat out given up..on yielding a greater return than these beasts. Every dollar I yield they will yield thousands
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:36:28
The internet would have been stopped if businesses did not realize it could ultimately give them more financial prosperity.
Just because they are not titled "Kings and the Church" does not mean we are not ruled by some form therein

1. Fuck ether, got it.
2. Fuck coinbase, what about Gemini? (I am a big numbers guy so I love their display, but if they suck w/ the community fuck them too)
3. Googling as we speak
4.Don't believe unless .org, got it
5. Just as we suspected!
6. Woaah dude
Thank you
@_date: 2016-05-25 21:38:53
I believe this is our freedom. We as a people have voluntarily consumed our way into having the least morality and actual wealth in history because we simply feed our instantaneous desires all day everyday with not a single thought about the long term implications
