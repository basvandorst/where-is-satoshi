I don't think that means what you think it means.

That's true. I forgot to mention that I am a founding stakeholder in Monetas: 
They are still kicking but I am not retaining any hope to see returns.

This is exciting stuff, especially for those of us involved in Monetas.
For those who would like to be involved, I'm trying to liquidate some shares. Please see [this table]( of funding history/plans and PM an offer. We can work through the company and keep everything above-board. The company has a TON of potential, I just need some cash.

Yeah I know it's hyperbole, I just assumed people won't know what monetas is. I've been on board since day 1.

Cool, that's good to know. My instinct tells me that holding shares is better than holding bitcoins, and it seems like that company will do a good job of retaining value even in the face of huge difficulty hikes.

Read the thread. People were balking due to a lack of info and clarification so the decision was made to push the IPO back.

Learn how to code. Not sure what else you're expecting to hear.

Hopefully that means their dividends will go up. These last few have been piddly. Any idea why?

I guarantee they've got teams on it though.

Well did the miners pay for themselves at least?

Because it takes some basic effort to understand. More so even than bitcoin. Once those guys build a functional system on top of it though, it could be huge.

Is it? I enjoyed the writeup and was looking forward to giving it a try.

Sounds like an awesome project. In the long term though, renting is a waste of money.
