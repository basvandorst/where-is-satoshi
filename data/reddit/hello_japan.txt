I have been critical of Bitfinex, but this seems like the fairest possible solution and everyone would do well to accept it. In a scenario where legal action is pursued, you will get back far less than 64% of your assets and you will be waiting for a year or two to get less money. Thank you for this equitable solution.

Blockchain.info already has an iPhone app, just as there are many other bitcoin related apps in the App Store, but don't let prevent you from frothing at the mouth about how Apple is anti-bitcoin.

I'm not trying to say that he is being nefarious but I am saying that he needs to explain himself, which he apparently did yesterday in another thread even if not as transparently and as fully as I might like. But it's at least something. He is trying to time the market by holding the funds as btc, that is unquestionable. This may or may not prove to be beneficial to Dorian but in my opinion it is an irresponsible way to handle donated funds.

Apologies if I was incorrect regarding the price at the time, but even so, I do not believe that Andreas should be attempting to time the market with donated money and should have liquidated the donated btc at the promised date even if for whatever reason he could not get it to Dorian at that time. We all know that this is a volatile asset and that nothing is certain and unless Dorian specifically asked for the funds to remain in btc, he should not be subject to the market volatility that we are willingly and knowingly accepting. I also was under the impression that he needed the money, but obviously I have no special information.

Really, you mean like the update they just tweeted about around a day or so ago?
@_date: 2014-04-19 14:18:12
I think you should read it again, and probably relax a little while you're at it.
@_date: 2014-10-01 19:51:00
I'll take this bet.
@_date: 2014-04-19 01:52:34
So has Dorian gotten his money yet? If so, why did it take so long? Well after your promised date. If not, why not? You cost him quite a bit by not liquidating the btc that was donated to him when you promised you would.

That's reasonable. I ascribe to the belief that the very real factors that you outlined were magnified at every step by the trading of assets on Gox that turned out not to exist. I agree with your point that the 2013 bubble was not manipulation by a single entity and or/coordinated group the way that the two big 2014 pumps were.
@_date: 2014-04-19 02:54:57
Really? By asking a question I am insinuating that? We shouldn't ask questions and should just accept everything we are told at face value? Worked out so well with Neo &amp; Bee and with assurances we received regarding Gox. I simply want to see the donated funds to be received by the man they were donated to. If it so happens that they are in the next few weeks then great. In the meantime, it is certainly justifiable to ask questions especially when the funds have not been delivered at the promised time. I certainly realize that there may be circumstances that prevented that but I also realize that it is our obligation to be skeptical and not blindly accepting as is so often the case.

You are an utter moron.

No court in the world would enforce that joke of a contract.

Thank you I had not seen that.

Sent you a pm. Thanks for remembering this and living up to it.

Hi Phil

Where is an audit of your fiat reserves? A crypto-only audit is only half the picture and does not at all prove solvency.

It's all manipulation. The pump to 680 was manipulation. The pump to 700 before that was manipulation. And the pump to 1100 was also manipulation. So let's not call the moves down manipulation but pretend like the moves up are natural and organic. Surely you could not watch the move from 450 to 680 being pushed up with moving buy walls and consider that legitimate buying?
@_date: 2014-04-19 02:44:34
What does that have to do with what I posted? Do you think it's ok that Dorian has not received his money and that Andreas did not handle the donated funds the way he promised to handle them?
@_date: 2017-09-12 20:20:05
They mean it is the most crowded trade in terms of predictions people are making not in terms of money invested, afaik

Send it to your personal wallet and then send it to finex from there. Sometimes coinbase does not like you sending btc to exchanges.

Are you too stupid to understand that the op created an account only to test if anything would even happen on your website, or are you just trolling? If that's what you consider a "client" then that speaks for itself.
@_date: 2015-09-09 12:37:04
What clients? You have no clients.

For traditional equities, amigo.

Seriously. What a dumb thread. This setup works perfectly well for me: 
But by all means the OP should continue his circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:39:32
Sure it can. My phone is not jail broken. iOS allows you to save any website as an app. You can replicate this setup exactly immediately.
