Hello, I'm sorry I can't answer that for you as I'm the only mod to have never worked for coinbase. I'm only a mod because I created this sub as a fan site and place people could get basic info regarding coinbase and bitcoin. Some Coinbase employees have decided to help me around here in their free time seeing they can offer far more insight then myself. I hope one of the other mods are able to give you more information.

I've never been good at puzzles or winning prizes, so I'll step out on a limb and be that person. Will you just give me the key?

I'm glad the team at coinbase.com was able to help you. I have much respect for the work you do.

Bitcoin has never come up in my lodge. I've talked about it with a few brothers but that is because we are friends and talk not because it is an agenda item in lodge. I seriously doubt bitcoin has come up in conversation in the minutes of any lodge.

Seriously? Ok think about it coinbase is having a run on the bank. A LOT of people keep funds on coinbase. Coinbase only needs a small faction of coins in a hot wallet for security. (They may even have further rules that stops and automated system incase of failure/hack). So yes it takes time .. it doesn't matter if they are having lag in buying new coins to sell you, or their system is throwing red flags to insure that customer funds are not at risk. This is bitcoin and a service that is small compared to the money try are responsible for. As far as I know they always honor locked in prices.

This ATM is in Raleigh and has about a 10% fee if I'm not mistaken. 
Also it does require ID to do anything with.

Or next time a willy wonka movie comes out they can have a real Golden Ticket inside some brand candy bar. It would raise awareness of bitcoin, and serve as a great way to get people talking about the movie. 
"Did you hear that the new Charlie and Chocolate Factory Movie is having a Contest were one Hersey's bar has a Golden Ticket worth 100btc."
