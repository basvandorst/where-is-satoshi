Nobody likes ads so they block them using computers. Without ads, Google's profits diminish. Without profits, people are replaced by computers. Without jobs, consumers can't purchase computers... Adam Smith must be rolling over in his grave.

Get a few ebooks and watch some youtube videos. There is a plethora of information out there for beginners (I'm still fairly new myself). 
IMO, the smartest thing to do is invest a fixed amount every week whether it be $20 or $200. Whatever you can afford. The price has plateaued over the last several weeks but it's likely to shoot up or down at any given time.
Just make sure to only invest what you can afford to lose and get accustomed to the reality of buying high (because you will never get it at its lowest). If you invest a fixed amount every week things should average out in the long run.
Also, put 90% of what you buy/earn in cold storage if possible. I personally bought a cheap used netbook just for cold storage.
Good luck friend.

I keep trying to tell people that banks provide free magic shows all day long. Give them a dollar and "POOF" ten dollars!

I've had good experiences with getting voice over work but not much else. I also had an artist draw a really cool comic strip that was beyond what I expected. In general though, logo/graphic design and audio mixing/mastering has been pretty underwhelming. For $5 it will pretty much be hit or miss.
