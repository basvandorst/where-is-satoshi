I don't think Bitcoin is going down because they are selling futures.
I think they are selling futures because Bitcoin is going down. 
Bitcoin already had some pressure. The fake news constantly coming from Roger Ver owned companies, the transfer fees being high, etc... Yesterday's news created a bearish trend. The bullish trend from last night and today was not strong enough to push it back.
We might hit 12500 if the dip buyers do not generate enough market force today... But I think, we should hit another support level between 11500 to 12500 if that happens

Pretty much all of the current crypto currency get their demand by speculation. Smearing the other one bad and yours good is a good speculation strategy.

Coinbase run a little bit of bait and switch  on their clients.
They used to have the cheapest taker/maker fee's. This is why they got so popular. Today they are the most expensive trading platform with highest taker/maker fee's in US.

Forget everyone else, listen to this guy. I still remember seeing the suicide prevention hotline sticky at the top of r/Bitcoin when it came down crashing from 19k

If he bought 2 years ago, he would have lost 60% if his initial investment because Bitcoin has been in a very deep drawdown for 2 years now..
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:45:16
None of those mean anything unless there is a demand for Bitcoin.... The price is going down because there is more supply than demand at the moment. 
I do not know what kind of news in the short term future would create more demand soon... The halving is said to lower the supply but with the last halving it took the market around a year to react. Given the recent talks about a recession, I think the  bull market might be around for a year...

I have been out of Bitcoin space for a while. Few years ago coinbase was the favorite child of this sub. What changed?
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:03:33
I see that people here has been arguing with you non-stop below and you keep giving well headed replies... I only have one suggesting for you.... Don't!
Only come here for the luls and memes... 
I love bitcoin. I agree with the people here that it should succeed... That being said this place is filled with most economically illiterate people I have ever seen... They have no idea about the difference between wishful thinking and things that are likely to happen due prior data. They get hostile towards anyone who does not share their wishful thinking.... They have been Lambos and moon nonstop for the last 2 years without a break... Yet, Bitcoin has been in drawdown for two years now.
The last time I took this subreddit seriously was when I told someone not to put all of his savings into Bitcoin when it was around 17k. I said look how fast it got here, this is very likely a FOMO. It might go down anytime now... I got laughed at...
@_date: 2017-01-05 06:04:06
I have coinbase. They only allow 15$ per week witout ID. I need 75$. It would take m more than a month to get that. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:32:06


Do you really think that people are buying bitcoin right now because of this? Or do you think most people are buying bitcoin because they think they can sell it in the future to make more money (in USD/EUR/etc)?

They were down at the same as well

Someone richer than I am buy this guy a gold for life... This is what I have been trying to say in this forum for a week or two now. 
I invested a bit in bitcoin. The other day my friend asked if he should invest in bitcoin as well. I told him, it is no different than taking a 10 shots of whiskey and sitting at the blackjack table. So, do not ever put the money you can't lose on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:59:54
Thanks for your input. Thank god, finally a guy who knows about economics commented. 
I also like the example with gold. I think it makes sense to compare BTC to gold. Time will tell if BTC will crash or stay steady like gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:57
It let me buy literally 15 minutes before the crash... After the crash I hit buy 20 times... None worked. Fuck you coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:06:17
This is why gdax was down when coinbase was down. So GDAX is no good if you are having technical problems with coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:57:27
Thanks man! It is great to know. It seems like this would be too loud for where I was planning to store it.

gdax is coinbase. I can't login to both right now.

It is above 10k again. Too late for Vegeta, we need the indian dancing guy quickly before it hits 11k again.  
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:46:57
That is my problem as well. I currently know 10+ bitcoin users... I think total of their bitcoin worth in USD is more than 100k right now. None of them has ever bought or sold anything with bitcoin in their life. All they do is put all of their money on BTC every month and wait for it to go up. 
So price is going up because everyone is buying and holding. What happens when most of these people start dumping? Is this not the classic definition of a market bubble? How is this different than people with little income buying 3 houses because they know they can sell it in the future for higher price.

Hookers and coke? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:37:41


No this is not what I am saying. All I am saying is that the cause of this change in the price **may** be a bubble in supply and demand. All bubbles explode sooner or later. If I am right and the increase is caused by a bubble, then it will explode sooner or later. But, will it explode when BTC hits 10k or 100k or 1M? I am here because I am planning to buy BTC as well. I really hope it does not explode until I make some good use of it. 
To be honest, the guy above sounds like the guy who said "Housing market will never go down because people will always need houses and population is increasing". But, as we saw, the housing market collapsed. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:47:07


Yup, that is the question I am asking. I do not know what is causing the change in the price. It may be a bubble or it may be something else. I do not have enough data to figure that out yet. 
All i am saying is that, I know 10+ guys whom are investing in btc right now. None of them has ever bought or sold anything with BTC in their life. They just invest in BTC in the hopes of selling it in the future.  **IF** everyone else is like this, then this will end up being a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:26:18
It was 9960 something, then i looked at the sell orders and said we need $20M before we can hit 10K... I said, nah it will probably dip before it hits 10k because of so many sell orders and panicking sellers. Then I went to bathroom and took a dump, I came back it is 10k :D 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:49:19
I'm currently investing in Bitcoin. I really wish that Bitcoin keeps increasing in the value. That being said, I fully agree with everything you said. More than 90% of current Bitcoin value is based on speculative holders. I was trying to explain this to some guys in this sub last week. I gave up when people started saying that Bitcoin can never go down in value because it is not effected by inflation.
Some of the investors in this sub can not even comprehend basic laws of supply and demand. My only hope is to double my money and get out before the big crash happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:40:06
I do not know any of those terms. I just started looking at this 2 days ago. They all are a lot more knowledgeable about bitcoin than I do. I doubt there is much I can teach them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:39:25
Yup, clicked buy 20 times from 8900 to 9500. None went trough :'-(
Then I started having a panic attack, thinking if all those buy orders go through all at once now, then I am fucked! Thankfully none did. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:26:12
Consider me a noob, but i always thought that bitcoin had privacy? I thought the wallets and transactions could not be tracked? 
Does this mean that we can tell how much money someone has or how much money is transferred from one account to another? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:28:01


Hmmm, let me state this again using better words. 
I believe bitcoin has a very bright future in the short term because of fomo (fear of missing out)... The latest increase we saw recently is because lots of people who know nothing about investing are dumping all of their money on bitcoin because they believe they can have more money in the end... When was the last time people talked about stock during thanks giving dinner, then dumped all of their cash on the said stock? This happened with bitcoin!! This is all part of fomo which is studied very heavily as  part of economic bubbles. 
As it stands right now, i believe bitcoin has a very big bubble that will keep getting bigger and bigger in the short term.. But, when new comers and the fresh meat runs out, it will hit rock bottom. 


Believe me, me and my friends know a lot more about investing than you do. We survived the tech bubble in 90s, then we survived (and made some more money) during the housing crash :)

This the amount you make or the amount the electricity costs? Also, looks like bitmain is down, so i don't think i can but one. 
Also, this will be running in my living room. Do you think the loudness is going to be a problem? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:41:31
With all due respect, you know nothing about economics, supply/demand, and bubbles. I will stop replying to you. I strongly suggest you to read some information about forex markets as some of it used for exchanging money for money (same as bitcoin). 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:26
I bought at 11k 15 minutes before the crash. I did not buy much. After the crash, I hit buy 20 times.. Reached the confirmation screen multiple times but none counted. So, i am at a loss thanks to coinbase and gdax :'-( 
I know it will hit 11k again and I will make money soon enough, but it feels like i am abandoned by coinbase at the time of my need... 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:36:01
Noob question here. 
If I pay 1500$ and buy one of these now. How long would it take for one of them to make back that 1500$? (I know they sell in 5s but I am just asking for 1)
How much would one of these add on top of my electricity bill? 
Also, as someone who is not very experienced at building up mining farms, how easy would it be to setup one of these? (I am very experienced at custom building PCs)
Thanks a lot for your time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:40:58
Yup, none of the bitcoin exchanges are regulated by any entity. They all are pretty much wild horses running around for their own benefit with no control or oversight. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:18:50


I hope this won't come off as offensive but this shows how little you know about economics. Price of everything, even money, is decided by supply and demand. Bitcoin is going up like crazy because there is more demand to it than anything else. 
But what is causing this demand? So far, everyone is demanding bitcoin because they believe they can sell it for more in the future. Noone is demanding it to use it. This could turn into real ugly bubble.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:15:55
I will be downvoted to hell for this. I have 0 confidence in the future of bitcoin. I am only investing because it seems like I can have more than 500% return in year. I think bitcoin will reach really high numbers. 100k seems close. But, sooner or later it will get a hit, crash down real hard, and stay flat. 
I know at least 10 people whom are the same as me. I never met in person with anyone who bought bitcoin because they believed in the tech. I know none of my friends would put a penny on bitcoin if the return was not better than any other investment option in the short term. Now, downvote me to hell.
