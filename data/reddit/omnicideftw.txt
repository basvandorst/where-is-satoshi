Umm, what?

I just want to add to what the others are saying by saying that no one controls Bitcoin. It is what's called decentralized. A decentralized crypto currency in fact. If there was one person, or even an organization that had total control over the protocol then it would probably be derailed pretty fast.
Obviously, as has been mentioned, the source code can be modified, but that doesn't effect the entirety of the currency, just your own private code that you've edited. 
I won't go into anymore detail, but I would suggest you use the sidebar to answer most of your basic queries.
Welcome to Bitcoin.

I absolutely agree. It's always weird when I try to open a Soundcloud link in reddit from RES and it's blocked by both extensions.

I use both Ghostery and Disconnect. I'm actually not entirely sure if using both accomplishes anything, but it doesn't seem to be hurting me at all.
Occasionally I'll get an Extension error in Chrome when one of them is unable to re-direct a tracker because the other one did it first. Pretty funny actually.

This was exactly what I was looking for, I am vastly grateful for your thorough response. Out of curiosity and I realize this is hard to guage, but when do you think the use of mBTC and satoshi units will become relatively commonplace?

Of course since I happen to be mining coins ,and I don't pay my electricity bill, the cost of investment in BTC for me is literally nothing so there's no loss. I appreciate the response very much, thanks.
