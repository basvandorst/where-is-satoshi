I don't think so. Baby Boomers aren't the main cause of the continued drug war. At least in the context of marijuana, [50% support it's legalization](
There are much greater interests and prejudices that keep the drug war going then a slightly more misguided generation of your parents or grandparents. Instead of saying I hope those fucks die off, maybe we should focus on the real causes such as vested banking interests, police militarization, and government propaganda.
The drug war will end only if there is a sustained movement to end it.  When weed is legalized (probably) will we stop there? Seems like it. People seem to tie weed to the entirety of the drug war. I know so many people in our millennial generation who are just like our grandparents, incredibly misinformed and afraid of the "hard drugs". Which is every drug besides weed in their minds. That won't end a war on *drugs*. Worse the pendulum might swing back, as it did before. Carter in the late 1970's actually pushed twenty states into decriminalizing at least marijuana and and possibly could've done more. Then the pendulum swung back thanks to Reagan. Perhaps today the pendulum won't swing back for weed. But I have a feeling we have a long way to go to end the War on Drugs and it won't be solved with "the old fucks" dying off like a lot of people say on this website.

Lol. It's pretty Austrian based economics coupled with full decentralization. Pretty much the opposite of Keynesian centralized economy that liberals love

Because its decentralized and that goes exactly against why they are?

I bought in at 25$ So I still have three times my initial investment.

If drugs were decriminalized I would still get everything from the Road..
