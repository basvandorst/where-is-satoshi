you are free to leave the country if you wish. you are free to try to dodge the government (which has a mandate from its citizens to track you down) if you wish. like it or not, being born into a society is better than some theoretical state where each individual decides their own special snowflake society (which in reality will just lead to formation of gangs/mafias/governments by force anyway).
@_date: 2015-12-04 03:16:14
you can pretend we don't live in a world where using state controlled banks is the easiest way to move money, but that doesn't make it the case

no. opt out of the society that agrees upon and is shaped by the government.

@_date: 2015-12-04 04:50:38
no i don't disagree but i'm a pragmatist, not an anarchist idealogue. you also rely on the premise that you can basically define theft however you choose. theft is immoral by definition, but what you presume is that taxation is theft.
@_date: 2015-12-04 14:26:45
well, if you value shortsighted self interest more than overall well being, that's fine.
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:39:30


but we do. like it or not, you live in a world inhabited by other people. you can try opting out and not cooperating, but it's just a bad choice in terms of your well being. humans' tendency to favor democracy and converging to giant world superpower societies in recent history and our dwindling odds of being murdered or starving to death are strong evidence of that.

@_date: 2015-12-04 05:00:09
if you think about it, you'll realize democracy is the least worst solution for solving the human nature problem. you're free to run or hide from the state, just as you're free to run from thieves or take out a marauding mob with your hand gun while living by your non aggression principle in your anarchist utopia. unfortunately the consequences for the latter are more grim.
@_date: 2015-12-04 16:47:55
i'm not saying it's ideal, i'm saying it's better than the alternative. the 'free market' isn't best for everything. the 'free market' decides that there should be government. source: milenia of human history. yes it would be better if we lived in a society where no one was coerced and no one chose to harm other people and everyone shared everything freely. that's a trivial thought that leads nowhere.
@_date: 2015-12-04 05:22:47
because when it's acknowledged that we live in a collective, we agree ahead of time to do things like give food and medicine and put out house fires even for people who are very poor while receiving nothing in return but the reassurance that the same would be done for us if we were in their situation, which increases the general welfare to an unprecedented level, even if it requires some of our money to be 'stolen' in the process.

@_date: 2015-05-20 23:09:53
yeah that's what i meant. but $13 in bitcoin today has not been worth $20 since 2014.
@_date: 2015-05-21 23:00:00
ok this is pedantic. a privately controlled blockchain is not trustless, therefore it is not called for compared to other existing implementations, that's my point.

actually i've never stored money in BTC but you're assuming i bought in at the height of the bubble? bitcoin has volatile value, but it doesn't systematically take your money.
and don't randomly throw around terms like cognitive dissonance please jesus christ.
no one said all credit unions charge the same amount, this post was about a particular one which does in fact charge $5 per month. not sure why you're so defensive.

dude what? the term abundance doesn't really apply to bitcoin. are you suggesting it was abundant enough at one time?
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:30:41


parse carefully. either way, what you said was false.
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:19:20
and if i spent $200 on bitcoins in 2010? cause with $200 in that bank i'd have $0
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:03:46
yes, but they are centralized, privately controlled networks. fundamentally different from the Internet itself. that is, it would be trivial to shut them down or change their behavior.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:45:10
yes how strange that not everyone who likes an online money system is a libertarian :\^)
@_date: 2015-01-08 15:06:12
so overdraft charges that are completely disproportionate to the service they cover are good because they allow banks to profiteer and to parent their customers effectively? okee dokee.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:28:32
i'd guess less coinbase users prioritize anonymity than users of bitcoin as a whole. coinbase is mostly used because it's an all-in-one solution that can tie conveniently to your bank account, has a nice little mobile app, etc. personally i use it as a superior alternative to paypal as a payment system.
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:25:08


isn't that, like, the bank's job
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:16:19
yes, but a worldwide network is different than a privately controlled network. point is, a centrally controlled 'blockchain' is pointless because trustlessness is one of the blockchain's primary goals.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:22:34
i guess your distinction between the 6 year trend and 1 year nontrend are arbitrary then since they obviously both contain reversals in direction of the price, and the only actual trend is the downward one starting yesterday?
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:56:41
what are you saying, how are $20 and $13 connected
@_date: 2015-05-01 07:25:48

yes you can.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:33:37
whatever the technical definitions are, you haven't specified them. the only specific you laid out is that a trend can be nullified by a single data point.
why are the 6 year and 4 month real but the 1 year not?
@_date: 2016-01-15 16:53:30
cherry picking is what only you are doing, since you're selecting the ~10% of bitcoin's lifespan in which it was valued higher than it is today.

very interesting but can't this be solved in a centralized way, like steam does with ingame items?
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:09:20
so a 4 year trend and a 1 year trend are invalid, but a 2 year trend following a widely known scandalous manipulation of the price is valid? that's some gymnastics you're doing there ;)
also you'd need to actually point out the proportion of btc trading volume that's at over $400 for your argument to mean anything.

@_date: 2017-09-12 15:23:51
making money by buying bitcoin in 2013 has literally nothing to do with technical analysis.
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:32:50
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:01:05
 looks like you're right
@_date: 2017-09-12 15:04:22
right. so any venture that isn't guaranteed is the same as playing the lotto.
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:30:35
again, you are playing dumb and pretending that risks can never be calculated or somehow always have negative expected outcomes by virtue of being risks. if i bet on a coin flip at 2.5:1 odds, i may lose but the bet is still good. people who thought bitcoin was a good bet are being rewarded. it's true that they can't "prove" it was a positive bet, but by the same token neither can you prove it was a bad one. the results are evidence toward the former, though.
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:29:49
it was way easier to mine before that. he could have started in 09.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:15:00


actually its price would be whatever miners charge for it which would be very close to whatever miners pay to mine it due to competition, which coincidentally is very close to the actual price right now. what concrete reason do you have for saying it would be $5? it's basically a completely arbitrary ratio. as it stands, people are spending 3600x235 usd per day on new bitcoin because that's what people think they're worth, despite your self appointed position as the arbiter of bitcoin's true worth.

except you had months or years to buy bitcoin before they took off for ~1000x profit. it's not really the same as profit in a flash like you're describing, and no one really banks on that. further, like i said, those same people were actively bashing it when it cost $4 for 1 btc. that's probably the source for some butthurt.
@_date: 2015-04-26 00:13:27
you know the current market cap for BTC is not the same as what Bitcoin is 'worth' right?
@_date: 2015-04-09 16:20:19
haha yeah, banks rule
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:49:53
what? the price of everything doesn't effectively start at 0 btw. the price of bitcoin spent a substantial amount of time at a tiny percentage of the value it has now. regardless of that, no one is arguing that bitcoin has been stable for its lifetime. the person you initially responded to was only talking about introducing to someone to bitcoin, not trying to convince them to use it to store their money. it is also not 'incredibly inflationary' in terms of purchasing power. the most you can say about its purchasing power is that it will be somewhat related to its volume of adoption once an initial place of stability is reached.

@_date: 2015-04-15 14:47:19
i don't know what simlife is but solving the double spend problem is a requirement for circumventing centralization (which is a worthy goal for some people). saying it's not an issue 'to begin with' is circular because it being an issue relies on a decentralized ledger to exist.

dude just use paypal. comparing the soundness of a system for trading ingame assets (i guess that's what you're talking about?) to that of one for trading money is ridiculous. not only that but people get scammed trading steam stuff and wow gold and etc etc all the time.
also to add that you CAN build non-anonymous systems on top of bitcoin without interfering with the anonymous aspect underneath, eg  attaching a btc address to a merchant profile or coinbase/circle accounts.

well, you can use regular money anywhere without buying gift cards. also that method requires you to estimate the amount of money you will spend and risks ending up with some insignificant change left over in a target gift card (annoying) or not putting enough money on the gift card and not being able to purchase what you want (more than annoying). it's not really practical to live day to day on bitcoin at the moment.

it's not productive to try to pander to people that are so antidrug and/or antibitcoin that they criticize bitcoin for being used to trade for drugs, because sticking hard to such a weak argument shows a probably unbreakable bias. so that makes it pretty boring to have that same debate again and again.

ok then your argument just turns into a truism. and it's not that same as the guy i replied to saying "Bitcoin is a zero-sum game. Every winner in Bitcoin has a loser. The majority of winners are the minority of people (early adopters). The average Joe is losing in Bitcoin." because bitcoin is clearly worth more now than it was when it was conceived. if you will argue that it is not, that's kind of the same as arguing against a valuation of anything at all.

what makes you think increased adoption would result in increased price? the price is still approaching a true value following the confirmed manipulation schemes of 2013, and even without that, it's not necessarily a rule that more people using bitcoin = higher bitcoin value. for instance bitcoin becoming incredibly easy to acquire and use would decrease the number of dormant btc required and possibly lower the price of each one, and the response of people adopting it increasingly due to the newfound simplicity might take awhile to catch up. the actual value of 1 btc is an interesting topic and it certainly involves many more than one simple factor.
and an anecdotal report from a single vendor about bitcoin transactions is heavily prone to variance. i have no reason to believe their sales are not increasing proportionally to the overall transaction volume. it would be different if there was available data showing bitcoin spending is decreasing. a lack of weekly reports of increased sales volume from all retailers accepting bitcoin is not evidence to the contrary.
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:07:00
it's not that they don't matter, it's that there is no convincing them. but the success of bitcoin does not depend on their judgment. they will participate out of convenience, or maybe a vocal minority will boycott it. they won't be the ones to keep bitcoin from succeeding.
@_date: 2015-04-29 05:33:13
so the value is proportional to the demand. there is orders of magnitude more demand now than there was in 2011. bitcoin is worth more than it was then, and by more than the money spent on mining. your bad assumption is 'given constant demand'.

no value is created directly when someone buys with another currency, sure. but demand in itself creates value. this is why the market cap changes all the time. it seems you're saying value in the universe is zero sum when you acknowledge that the bitcoin space can swap value with usd space, which isn't really the same as saying bitcoin itself is 'zero sum'.
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:40:16
ok, but that still doesn't say why $5 is more valid than $200 or $10000. i think you're just too befuddled by it being 'imaginary' value to see that there is grounds for speculation and the free market determines the value better than you do. that's why arguing about the price is futile, it's already determined by the collective for one reason or another. it's a lot like debating the monetary value of art.

it's just kind of obvious. bitcoin can be mined for less than the cost of bitcoin (to see this clearly, take a snapshot at a point where bitcoin is at a peak value), the miner makes a profit by selling it but the person who buys it for say $x still has $x worth of bitcoin. the fact that the price fluctuates does not mean it is zero sum.
for a more obvious example, look at diamond or gold mining. they are not zero sum, mining companies are highly profitable but people that buy precious metal or stones do not necessarily lose value.

it isn't a zero sum game. the bitcoins mined in 2010-2012 put the category of bitcoin 'shareholders' heavily in the black overall. that is, all of the currency spent on bitcoin for all time is less than the current value of all bitcoin in existence. but yeah, it still shows a pretty juvenile character to need to take solace in the fact that some people lost money. and calling it a ponzi is just asinine. any asset that appreciates in value rewards people that get in early, and almost every asset eventually becomes worthless. even if bitcoin does eventually develop that second characteristic, that doesn't make it a ponzi scheme and dismissing it as that is insulting to everyone's intelligence.

what happened?
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:45:02
the number of people using it. don't care to link for someone who argues dishonestly :)
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:26:55
demonstrating the rule :\^)
@_date: 2015-10-12 02:50:54
idk if you're being ironic or what dude
@_date: 2015-10-21 16:18:48
intranets serve a purpose though, the idea of a private blockchain is pretty much incompatible with the idea of the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-10-27 21:01:37
it takes it from the person who would otherwise inherit it and redistributes it evenly among all btc holders.

anarchist rhetoric where law = violence
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:34:55
true, and most people just don't have the impetus to put any effort into understanding as long as their current money works fine for them.
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:15:19
difference between digital money and digital representation of some other currency.
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:12:06
haha fair enough. circle is awesome but i'd be more eager to drop chase than coinbase since it seems they'd be equally likely to ban transfers with any established bitcoin service in time. i would guess circle will work with your debit card but no idea about things like prepaid cards.
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:05:21
curious, did you try using coinbase with your chase account after that?
@_date: 2015-10-10 12:59:06
so basically you just assumed it ok.
the question of whether the dollar will be replaced by bitcoin (it won't) has nothing to do with the value of a home anyway. if it did, then having the home would be better than having dollars and the dollar collapsing would not devalue the home.
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:18:19
do you know that there is a difference between bitcoin and @_date: 2015-10-12 00:33:10
i just use simple for everyday purchases and bitcoin transactions, it's a bare bones checking with no fees. no complaints with it so far but it's  basically for people that never use cash or checks. has a nice phone app unlike chase's cancer. ally is another online bank that's supposed to be good but no experience there.
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:11:10
wow i can't believe something that goes up and down a lot went down over a certain period of time
@_date: 2015-10-10 17:12:09
right, you took a risk that happened to massively pay off. it's just that as someone who got incredibly lucky to come out with some motivational speech about how all you have to do is set your mind to it etc etc is just funny, but i understand how hard it is to overcome self-serving bias. if OP does what you are suggesting, he will probably have pocket change in a few years, not thousands of dollars (or millions?) like the 2011 people do.
mostly referring to "the only thing between you and your goals are the excuses you tell yourself" which is just such an oversimplification and largely untrue.
@_date: 2015-10-22 03:22:24


is that a problem banks have currently?
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:05:24
true, but at the same time, that line of thinking would lead you to reduce any question of why you might/not do something to 'whether the benefits outweigh the cost'. op's question is really asking what the costs *are*. in this case, i think establishing understanding is one of the primary costs.
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:36:27
so i guess the fact that bitcoin is growing steadily despite the assertion that the community is nothing but bad for it to this point is a good sign.
@_date: 2015-10-10 11:48:48
what basis do you have for saying he could not sell his home for what he claims it's worth?
@_date: 2015-10-21 16:36:31
that's not really what companies mean when they throw around "private blockchain" rhetoric though. it usually refers to blockchain minus bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-11 21:38:06
no, it isn't. takes 1-2 days from my experience. also $300/week limit until you build a history.
@_date: 2015-10-10 12:01:55




maybe that's why
@_date: 2015-10-12 11:50:59
ha ha ha amazing red herring example my dude
@_date: 2015-10-12 02:40:18
true, that's something i left out. i think that form of trust based on who your neighbors trust is a factor in some things, but in this case most people still don't know anyone who uses bitcoin, let alone enough people to establish that kind of communal trust.
i feel like people that trust anything with a lock on the screen are an unfortunate population, like old folks that fall for lottery scams, but i think 'legitimate' educated trust is more important to address.
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:15:26
"bitcoin's price will crash permanently any day now!"
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:32:33
they can still be reasons "why people dislike bitcoin" even if they are mostly false
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:19:38
using it doesn't directly require understanding, but trusting it does. using a vehicle to handle your finances requires a degree of trust, and that can be hard to establish.
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:29:42
yeah, but they can still be used as reasons.
@_date: 2015-10-20 23:22:58
also depends on how likely it is to be worth 0
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:46:17
but the quarter pounder won in the end. and where are A&amp;W restaurants now :'(
@_date: 2015-10-10 11:52:32
lol easy to say that as someone who struck gold
@_date: 2015-10-10 19:08:24


sure but none of your initial post suggested any of that. it was about using college loans on bitcoin mining hardware which was a single dubious decision (that only someone in a position of privilege would be able to make) that happened to pay off.
the fact that the value of bitcoin is on a 2 year downtrend suggests strongly that the value will not be orders of magnitude higher than it is now in only a couple years. i would say that's an 'idea' of where bitcoin is going. anyway, he has 9 btc accumulated so presumably he's already committed about as much or more capital to bitcoin than you did in 2011 and it's a pretty strong guess that it won't get him as far as it might have gotten someone such as yourself.
and the point remains that there are billions of people in the world that will never escape poverty, have they want, etc, for reasons other than lack of willpower, excuses, etc etc. it's really just evidence of an extremely privileged position that you can even suggest such a thing.
