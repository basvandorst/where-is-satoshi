1. You need a copy of the software to restore your wallet. If you're worried about this archive a copy of electrum and store it with your seed.
2. It's not going to withstand bruteforcing. The reason is that they have the seed locally and that means they can make lots of attempts to bruteforce your seed extention. Billions of attempts a second. Since human beings are not a good at making random phrases any scheme you come up with for a password won't withstand such attempts. Human beings not being good at this is why the seed is computer generated in the first place :). So it'll keep casual snoopers at bay but will not stop committed attackers.
There is also the risk that you forget the seed extension and lose access to your coins. In most cases people lose bitcoin because they forgot their password not because they got hacked.
Actually the reason for the seed extension is so you can create multiple wallets with the same seed. It is to make backups easier. The extension can be something trivial like 1,2,3 etc. 
bip44, which most other wallets use, has this HD account feature that Electrum wanted to duplicate. Electrum doesn't use bip44 so Thomas included this seed extension feature which does almost the same thing - one seed that can be used to create multiple wallets.

regarding 3 make sure you also write down the wallet software name i.e. electrum and the version of electrum you used. when you restore use the latest version of electrum at the time of restoration (electrum maintains backwards compatibility with all electrum seed mnemonics).
you won't believe the number of users who forget what software they used to create their wallet. so take this additional precaution as well.
@_date: 2018-09-16 18:56:54
no don't use tails since it has an older version of electrum that has difficulty synching with the network. if you want to use a live cd use a regular linux live CD such a debian or ubuntu one and then install electrum on that as per the instructions on electrum.org/ don't install from the debian/buntu repos because those have the older version too.

Nope that is a separate entry. The 11.54 mill is depreciation on equipment and other assets (excluding cryptocurrencies).
However, if you read the notes below the statement you will see that they are hoping the price will rise so that they can make more money from selling their hoarded coins. In other words they are speculating on the price of bitcoin to save their operation. They could just as well have bought bitcoin and saved themselves all the trouble. 
Overall it just seems to be a scam to defraud investors. They wouldn't invest if you told them you were going to buy bitcoin and sit on it for 5 years. However, if you sell them a story of bitcoin mining riches suddenly their wallets open up.

Thanks for letting us know what the ground reality is. The situation is similar in Pakistan. Actually we never had any large exchanges (just one small one) and when the central bank decided to stop banks from facilitating traders everyone moved to p2p markets. The major difference is that no one here took the central bank to court. The sole exchange we had just folded overnight. At least you Indians are fighting it! You are also fighting Aadhar while over here NADRA has just steamrolled through. No one even thinks about the power the government has over individuals just because it controls who gets ID cards and who doesn't.

is wrong about change going back to the same address. That only happens when you import private keys. It doesn't happen with the standard deterministic wallets that electrum has (the ones that come with seed words that you are supposed to write down).

You have many receiving and change addresses not just one. You can't get their private keys if all you have is one address' private key.


Nope. It isn't possible
Write down the seed words. Those are your backup. If it helps think of them as your private keys in a human friendly format.
The tree that you are talking about in Q2 is derived from your seed. It can't be derived from address specific private keys aka child keys.
@_date: 2018-09-28 10:51:10
You are mistaken. There is no such ban. The central bank can only regulate financial institutions and it is telling them not to process payments for cryptocurrencies. There is  no law against trading it. Parliament makes the laws in Pakistan not the central bank. See how many dozens of traders are actively doing it on localbitcoins:  
Also note that you can trade for bank payments as long as the bank doesn't find out. Banks don't really know what person to person payments are for so it's not really a problem. All banks routinely accommodate money launderers in Pakistan so you you need to stop being so naive. This is a kleptocracy after all.

Addresses don't have spaces in them. Addresses have a checksum in them to detect typos so if you ever enter an address incorrectly your wallet will display an error and refuse to send money to it. Also you shouldn't be typing in the address manually. Always copy paste them or use the QR code if you're dealing with a phone. They are too complicated to be typed in manually.

You will lose money if you save the private keys. Electrum generates new key pairs all the time as you use your wallet. A private key backup will quickly go out of date. A seed backup OTOH is for all time since all your private keys are derived from the seed.

electrum doesn't use bip39. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 21:11:11






lol no. have you heard of bip84? lightning? every new "purpose" requires a new derivation path according to bip44 so 10 years from now no wallet will support bip39/44. in fact there is no guarantee about anything bitcoin related 10 years from now. bitcoin is still being rapidly developed.
popular is not the same thing as good or safer. you can see the reasons why electrum chose to go it's own way [here]( note electrum has been doing deterministic wallets with seed mnemonics for years prior to bip39/44 and even bip32.
@_date: 2018-09-01 02:37:08
- pre 2.0 seeds did not have a checksum in them but a 13 word electrum seed is from 2.0 - 2.6.4 (2b in the second link above). This does have a checksum in it and if electrum is letting you click on next after you enter the seed then that means the checksum validates. So the only things you can try are listed in [here]( If you've tried these things and you still don't see a wallet history then that means the seed you have is for a different wallet.
- bip39 is not encryption. it's a seed mnemonic format. bip39 seeds tend to come in multiples of 12 words so it's unlikely it's bip39. 
- you can create a new wallet via file &gt; new/restore, enter a unique filename and click next. no need to use a separate device if you just want to create more wallet files/attempt restoring again.
@_date: 2018-09-01 04:40:43
the other reason for mining is to distribute new coins. there is no central bank so you need a fair mechanism for distributing newly generate currency. mining is that mechanism.
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:58:22
The link that I've posted above [a day ago]( in the comment you replied to contains this separate entry for crypto currency losses titled "fair value loss on re-measurement of digital assets". So it's not part of the 11.54 mill figure. Perhaps you should read the full 
statement again? 
The cost to mine a bitcoin should also include the cost of the hardware. ASICs are only good for one thing and they don't have much scrap value. Depreciation is how we account for all that. If you don't include that very important cost then your numbers are off and you are lying to people.

@_date: 2018-09-19 19:33:06


Here's the problem. Watch only wallet must contain both the xpubs not one xpub + one seed. Alternatively if the watch-only wallet contains just one xpub and no seed then it's not a watch only version of the multisig wallet. It's a watch only version of a single sig wallet corresponding to the wallet with that xpub's seed.
@_date: 2018-09-02 22:02:13

@_date: 2018-09-05 18:00:47


How did you test these private keys? I'm guessing you exposed them to some malware site and perhaps exposed the xpub too. The combina. Or perhaps you exposed the seed mnemonic aka recovery phrase to some malware site. You were robbed but not by blockchain.com. They don't have access to your private keys.
Anyway as the others have pointed out you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how deterministic wallets work. You wasted your time harrassing bc.i support when all you had to do was restore from seed in a bip39/44 compatible wallet like electrum. bc.i just provide a free service. They are not going to hold your hand.
The good news is that your incompetence has come to light before you could launch an exchange and possibly lose your customer's funds. I sure hope you now have the good sense to give up your plans to launch an exchange.
@_date: 2018-09-20 18:51:43
Electrum may not support restoring from bip39/44 for long so be mindful of this if you're going to use bip39/44.
also even if you use bip39/44 you need a copy of some wallet software that supports those two standards. so how does this help you again? is archiving electrum harder than archiving say copay?
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:40:55
try reading:


@_date: 2018-09-06 04:43:37
the way their wallet works is that when you visit their site for the first time you download a javascript app that runs in your browser. this app generates your private keys locally on your own device, encrypts them with the password you chose and then uploads an encrypted copy to bc.i's servers. they have no way of getting to your private keys/seed since all they have is an encrypted copy of your wallet.
bc.i ignoring support requests is par for the course. like i said they offer a free wallet and api and are not going to walk you through something especially when you ignored the warning in their documentation.
As for how you got compromised maybe you fell victim to a phishing scam and entered your bc.i login details at the phisher's website. Maybe you have malware on your PC. 
Also note that the way deterministic wallets work if an attacker gets his hands on a child private key **and** the xpub they can calculate the private keys of all the other addresses' in the same HD account.
@_date: 2018-09-25 19:44:27

no you don't have to take the transaction to a mental asylum
when it comes to moving money from cold wallet to hot wallet they do it manually. so the key difference is the human oversight. if the humans are dishonest or negligent then this doesn't help you at all. in the past we've seen that negligence when moving funds between cold and hot wallets has led to exchange losses. for example mt.gox kept funding its leaky hot wallet and eventually went bust.

Yes using blockchain.info is fine for this task but using an app on your phone might be easier simply because you can take a picture of the private key QR code with the phone's camera instead of manually typing your key into your PC.

If they could roll back they would. A silent inflation bug if exploited and undetected for days would be hard to roll back because you have all these other transactions that have already taken place in that timeframe. Those double spent coins would also have been spent and you can't really hold the recipients accountable for the thief's  actions can you? So at the point they would just issue a patch to prevent further inflation but the inflation that already happened would have to be accepted by us.

now that you've clarified what type of wallet you meant i can answer your question properly. if the funds were sent to the address corresponding to the  one private key you backed up and you never had any outgoing transactions then you can recover all your funds. if you made outgoing transactions then change would have been sent to change addresses and unless you backed up the private keys of those as well you will lose money. also note that electrum continues to derive new private keys from your seed for new receiving and change addresses as you use your wallet. so best to just backup the seed because all private keys - old and new, receive and change - can be derived from that.

Two possible reasons:
- Mining is still very profitable
- The mining economy is a pre-order one which means you have to make investment decisions months in advance. Whatever ASICs were ordered 3 months ago are only now coming online. If you just received delivery of new ASICs it may be better to mine with them than to let them sit idle.

Transactions appear instantly. IDK why it took 30 seconds for the OP. The transaction wouldn't have confirmed in 30 seconds unless the OP was lucky. Confirmations take 10 minutes each. 
Credit card payments can be reversed up to a year later while bitcoin payments are irreversible after 6 confirmations (an hour long wait) so the comparison isn't fair.
Addresses have checksums in them to prevent typos. QR codes have additional checksums in them. However if despite all this you do send to the wrong address (because say you got confused and copied the wrong address) the transaction is irreversible so you better hope the recipient is honest and willing to pay you back. 
The irreversibility has its pros and cons. It's good for merchants because payments fraud is eliminated. Merchants in a lot of industries are forced to police their customers who pay via CC or paypal because that's a reversible payment method. Demands for IDs are not uncommon. So consumers benefit from the irreversibility too because they don't have to fork over personal docs to every merchant they deal with. The cost of the product also goes down because the merchants don't have to deal with payments fraud. The process of buying becomes much smoother and faster.
It's bad if you get scammed or hacked though. No way to get your money back and no one to turn to for justice.

Replace bitcoin with dollar in what you wrote. Here let me do it for you:












What do you think about the above now? Bitcoin is money. To get money you earn it or exchange other forms of money for it i.e. buy bitcoin on an exchange with dollars. To earn bitcoin you do the same things you do to earn dollars i.e. sell something for it or [work for it]( In addition you could try mining bitcoin but here again you need to invest a lot of money to mine profitably nowadays. Millions of dollars. So like they say to make money you have to have money!
There is no secret way to get rich off bitcoin. You have to bear risk.
@_date: 2018-10-20 23:18:17

The encryption electrum uses is strong. It's [AES 128 CBC mode]( However, it's only secure for your PC wallets because the android ones are limited to 6 digit PINs which can be easily bruteforced. Your android device has to be rooted in order for you to get the wallet file off the device.
So apart from your android wallet backing up to the cloud is fine. Note that most people lose their bitcoins because they don't have easily accessible backups or they forgot their encryption password and not because they were hacked.

If the key uses low quality random numbers say within 2^32 or something small like that then it's possible to iterate through all possible keys. After that it's simply a matter of deriving the corresponding addresses and looking up the balance on the blockchain. If you find a private key that controls coins you sweep them to an address whose private key only you know.
This is all speculation though. We have no way of knowing what happened in your case. We can only guess. If you care enough you may want look into getting your system analyzed by computer forensics people.

Just display a QR code of the privkey. You can fund the corresponding addresses beforehand.
Keeping the privkeys confidential will be the tricky part. You don't want ad company employees from grabbing the coins first.
Also someone will surely setup a IP cam pointing at your billboard and automate the business of sweeping those coins. I would do this if it went on long enough. This will completely kill the chances of any human getting the coins manually and with it the interest of most people.

transactions are atomic in nature i.e. either they happen and are recorded in the blockchain or they didn't happen at all. if your transaction is a low paying one it'll either confirm or it won't. you won't lose your money.
there are also two ways (replace by fee and child pays for parent) in which you can increase the transaction fee after you've sent the transaction. this way if your initial fee is too low and miners are loath to pick up your tx you can bump the fee later. this allows cheapskate users to low ball the fee initially.

You've misunderstood him completely. He's using some hash number from some blockchain as his passphrase. Some transaction ID or block hash for instance. He's not changing how openssl does key stretching.
Base64 is not encryption. It's just a different way to encode the data.
He wants to store his seed online not on him all the time.
Note I'm not saying what he's doing is a good idea just that you've misunderstood everything he wrote.

If you don't expect demand to increase then hodling is irrational, yes. You should cash out in that case.
However, if you see a future where bitcoin is more widely adopted then hodling will mean your coins will be worth more in future. I do see such a future especially since lightning makes spending bitcoin faster and cheaper. 
Given where we are headed in the world with trade wars and what not a form of money that is apolitical could have uses for nation states looking to free themselves of the dollar hegemony. 
We are also seeing a tightening of fiat money regulations. Swiss bank accounts are no longer secret. Countries are sharing taxation data between each other. If you want to keep your wealth outside the control of governments then you have fewer and fewer options in the fiat world.

The Pakistan of the hippie trail is long gone. The enlightened citizens you remember either died off or migrated to western countries. General Zia began the process of islamization in the 80s and what it has led to is widespread extremism even among the educated elite. 
As for rule of law I don't think you realize what I mean by that. It means that murderers, robbers, rapists, kidnappers mostly get off scot free. In fact they are often helped by the police. Most of our problems are actually linked to lack of law enforcement.

It does threaten the documentation of the economy on which basis governments collect taxes.
BTC transactions are actually all public but they are associated with pseudonyms i.e. bitcoin addresses. It's conceivable that governments will develop tools to mine that data and maybe make some sense of it.


This i don't understand. How do you imagine that a deflationary currency will cause a credit bubble?


That's a good question. Right now interest rates in countries with reserve currencies have an impact on the whole world. If BTC becomes the single world currency will we even have fractional reserve banking? Will it be used as an alternative to gold where it just sits under the control of central banks who use it to back their fiat currencies or will it be used by ordinary people directly? If it's the former then fractional reserve banking will continue and interest rates matter. If it's the latter then central banks will not be calling the shots.

Yes there was a need for a uncensorable electronic payment method that was unmet by the traditional banking system. So bitcoin was created to facilitate such activities. 
Mind you illegal changes from place to place and from time to time. For instance online gambling is deemed illegal in the US but bitcoin lets you gamble anyway. In shitty third world countries sending money out of the country is illegal but bitcoin lets you do it anyway. Even with the drug trade we are now seeing that what used to be illegal (cannabis consumption) is now becoming legal.

There are a few things to consider here:
- Validity is different from confirmation. You can verify the validity of the transaction right away. Confirmation means it's been incorporated in a block in the blockchain. Blocks are generated on average once every 10 minutes. First confirmation means its been incorporated in a block. Second means another block with different transactions has been added to the chain in front of the block containing your transaction. Third means two more blocks have been added and so on. The deeper it is in the chain the harder it is to reverse it. Depending on your risk appetite you may consider 0-6 confirmations sufficient. Transactions that have confirmed at least 6 times are considered irreversible.
- Bitcoin is a decentralized global payment system. It cannot be compared to centralized fiat payment systems. It is much less efficient than them and slower in some ways. What it gives you is uncensorable transactions which may or may not matter to you. Using bitcoin to pay for a bus ticket is sort of like using a nuke to kill a fly. It's way overkill.
- Nevertheless people do actually use bitcoin in this manner. The way merchants handle unconfirmed transactions varies from merchant to merchant. Most tend to accept unconfirmed transactions. This might seem like a dumb thing to do until you realize that you aren't really comparing apples to apples here. A bitcoin transaction that has confirmed sufficient number of times is set in stone and cannot be changed or reversed. That happens in about an hour's time. A similar fiat transaction with a credit card is going to take a year. Yes you can chargeback on your CC transactions for up to a year later. So the reason merchants are willing to accept the risk of zero conf transactions is because they are already doing just that by taking CC payments. Besides for small value transactions the losses from potential double spends is minimal.
- Orphan blocks are relatively rare. A bigger risk is a user double spending his coins on purpose. That is paying the merchant and then paying himself the same coins with a higher miner's fee to encourage miners to mine that second transaction. It's not something ordinary users do though. Note: you can't double spend transactions that have already confirmed.
- A new development is lightning which is a second layer on top of bitcoin. This is designed for instantaneous low value payments. In the near future we will be able to use it to pay for bus tickets and such things just like we use fiat. It's cheaper and faster but it's less secure than on-chain bitcoin transactions.

Confirmed transactions cannot be double spent. Lightning transactions cannot be double spent. I never said second layer takes away the trustlessness. 
Fees have gone down a lot. You have outdated info. Also lightning transactions will have negligible fees.
Bitcoin being an uncensorable and irreversible global payment system is best used for international money transfers where trust between the parties is an issue. It is also cheaper than other payment methods for small value transactions. Examples are:
- Remittances 
- Ecommerce purchases by third worlders who are generally looked down upon by first world ecommerce stores. Bitcoin transactions being irreversible means these vendors don't face the risk of payment reversal.
- Small value international money transfers. Payments to freelancers for example. Bitcoin is the cheapest way to transfer small amounts internationally.
Bitcoin is not an efficient payment method for most in-person PoS transactions. The uncensorability comes at the cost of speed. It also doesn't make sense to use bitcoin for PoS transactions in developed countries where everyone already has a CC in their pocket.
A block is mined on average every 10 minutes. So your transaction will confirm in 10 minutes not an hour. An hour is for 6 confirmations at which point the transaction is considered irreversible. This is for high value transactions where you want to take no chances.
The reason I'm writing all these detailed answers is not because I have an agenda to push. I'm explaining the upsides and downsides to the system. I don't care if you use bitcoin or not.

The thinking goes that they are speculating on the price of bitcoin and that's why they hoard coins when the price is low and sell when the price is high.

yes the single private key is being generated on one device while with multisig you use different devices that may belong to different people who jointly handle the wallet. the risk of one device being compromised is greater than the risk of multiple devices being compromised simultaneously. besides using bitaddress is not considered safe because the code silently falls back to insecure key generation.
if you want proper multisig i suggest using electrum or copay.
@_date: 2018-07-10 16:12:43
who is the person you suckered into paying for this?
@_date: 2018-07-23 04:37:19
you have to use bitaddress.org's split wallet tab to combine the shares and get the private key for your address. after that you can [import]( or [sweep]( (recommended) it using electrum. you import the private key not the address and just entering it without any special formatting will do the job.
btw this isn't multisig. this is a single private key split into multiple shares. with multisig you have multiple private keys behind each address and a subset of those must be used to sign spending transactions.

It's an improvement over the old base58 format. The benefits are:
- the checksum in it detects more typos than the one in legacy base58 addresses.
- it passes the radio test which means you can communicate the address over the phone and the other party won't mistake it for some other address. it's case insensitive for example.
- it's more compact when encoded in QR codes.

do you have ads posted on localbitcoins? AFAIK this requirement is only for those who created their own ads. you don't have to submit ID if you trade on other people's ads.

He says he's been trying to buy it for years. But in this case the domain has been registered since 96 by an unrelated enterprise and is a premium name. Seems the scammer was willing to pay more.

shitty third world countries are shitty because their governments are short sighted. they will reverse this ban in the future when bitcoin gets used for international trade and they need it to finance their imports.

Just to be clear you guys sell the semi-transparent plastic revealers that we put on top of the encrypted seed to reveal the seed right? We buy the revealers, enter the code on them in the revealer plugin, print the encrypted seed on regular paper and use the revealers when we want to see the seed?
I ask because there is some confusion regarding exactly what you are selling. See for example this post on the electrum forum:


You may want to make that clear on your site.
Anyway I think it's a great idea and I'm glad to see projects like these that bring new products to the crypto universe. It's also great that they serve as a funding source for wallet developers like the electrum ones.
BTW there was a person here who wanted exactly this sort of thing and [made a thread]( about it a few days ago so there's definitely a market for this sort of thing.

that's not what legal tender means. legal tender simply means it's a government approved method for settling debts and paying taxes. it doesn't mean it's illegal to use anything else. lots of indians hoard gold and in rural areas using commodities as a medium of exchange is still a thing.

as sure as one can be given that bitcoin is pseudonymous. you can follow the inputs up the chain and you'll see that they received deposits from customers at p2sh and legacy addresses and then use bech32 addresses internally to save on tx fees.

seems they can still sell to foreigners and receive money as remittances. they can also trade for cash in person. it'll basically go underground.

yes like last year. we hit 12-13btc in fees per block last year. should be more than enough.
bitcoin will also be worth a lot more
btw difficulty can adjust downwards too so if mining ever becomes unprofitable difficulty goes down and it becomes profitable again. the equilibrium is maintained.

WP core and Woocommerce are secure. It's other plugins and themes that cause problems. Blockstream itself is using WooCommerce and released a plugin for it.

It is secure. WP is used in some 25% of sites. WC is also the most widely used shopping cart software. Both have been thoroughly battle tested.

If it's more profitable to mine than to buy you mine and that means less money flows into buying bitcoin and that reduces the price of bitcoin. If it's more profitable to buy than to mine you buy and that pushes up the price.

Developer says asking price in 2012 was the [cost of a house]( Typically domainers ask for a lot initially because they expect you negotiate it down. I imagine it would have sold for USD 5 figures at least.
I think the domain has been hijacked by the scammer. There is no point in paying tens of thousands of dollars for a domain that will be suspended by the registrar as soon as complaints start pouring in.

It's still in development and wallets are still working on adding support for it. It's not right to advertise it just yet. I'm actually surprised that no one has lost a large amount on lightning yet.

he also says they have bots that track social media activity and github commits so that they can decide on what alts to invest in. it's quite interesting.

If they can afford to mine at these prices that means it's still wildly profitable for them. So we can expect further price declines.

21.co and earn.com. 21 probably alludes to bitcoin's 21 million coin cap. earn.com is just a really nice domain they bought for their paid surveys crap.

People in developing countries are used to dealing in cash. That's why the indian government had to resort to overnight demonetization to get the people to use electronic payment methods. There is no taboo or fear of large cash purchases like you have in the west.
