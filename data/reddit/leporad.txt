damn, can i have some? :D
@_date: 2014-07-28 14:58:40
Over reddit?
@_date: 2014-08-18 00:40:14
That's what I thought, but it doesn't hurt to try it and see if it pays out.
Also, it's very small amounts if you're not super damn good at 2048.

[My reply to this](
@_date: 2014-08-18 00:40:30
I haven't seen an ad on the site. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:53:00
I'm new to bitcoin, did you send him a real cookie?
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:17:11
So what just happened O.o
@_date: 2014-08-18 02:15:46
Oh.. and you had to remove this post as well? :(
@_date: 2014-08-18 03:02:14
Ahh, people were starting a ref train, an old trick. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:00:51
I'm guessing this is a website to buy stuff using btc. Can I get a tl;dr?
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:04:07
So how would I get an offline wallet? 
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:13:06
Okay thanks. I've transferred all my 0.4 BTC there.
@_date: 2017-02-15 18:31:50
Sounds like it's doing a lot of work. So if I end up getting a lot over 100 addresses, I can use it all to buy one object in the future? 
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:57:59
I was told Airbitz was better
@_date: 2014-08-18 00:41:35
Attracting referral link replies? 
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:11:58
But it's not like coinbase would ever just take it away?
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:52:56


What? To me it's just a currency. 


Does it's value go up/down based on us too? 
@_date: 2017-02-13 07:39:50
Which software?
@_date: 2017-02-15 15:36:42
See, I don't wanna accidentally get someone to send me money to a random address that is no longer is linked to my wallet. Coinbase has a static wallet address. 
I went ahead and sent a little bit. It worked instantly and is now pending. The wallet ID is now different. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 17:34:44
Great. So the old addresses, even though they are no longer there on the app can still be used to get money. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:05:53
@_date: 2017-02-13 18:34:25
Where can I get a good wallet?
@_date: 2014-07-16 01:36:28
People still mine bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-15 07:10:26
So I can view my BTC address just by clicking request, and this address will never change, right? 
@_date: 2017-02-18 06:16:52
I'm Canadian so this figure doesn't really matter to me but I actually initially got bitcoin to purchase gold with since the website provided a discount for users who used bitcoin rather than paypal. 
But I noticed that bitcoin has just been going up and up, and realized that it's a better investment to not buy gold. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:11:50
So you're saying it won't be going down in value in the future?
@_date: 2017-02-13 06:05:43
It might go down
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:42:56
So... It's already in an exchange :)
@_date: 2017-02-19 09:08:12
Black people are 5% of the population, yet 80% of the crime. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 02:53:13
It was a gift that was meant to be spent like any other currency, however, I'm not really in need of spending right now... which is why I'm questioning whether it'll go up or down. 
For me, it's not about whether it hits 40k or a million. It's more about if it'll go down or up at all. And if it goes up, how quickly. 
How do I set up an offline wallet? I thought coinbase was pretty safe. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:46:59
I thought banks are safe. Yes I do need help with this..
@_date: 2017-02-13 07:41:34
Why hasn't most wealthy people invested in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 16:36:28
Posts like this make me think BTC is just a big meme. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:40:30
Why hasn't someone done it by now?
@_date: 2017-02-18 06:05:49
Posts like this make me think this whole thing is a joke.
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:59:11
If I'm going to keep my money in for the long term, I better choose something else. I guess coinbase is only good for conveniently purchasing bitcoin. There's even app for it that's rated higher on the play store and is 10x more popular. But if what you're saying is true, I'll just go with Airbitz.
I downloaded the app but I don't know how to navigate it. Like, how do I transfer my coinbase 0.4 BTC into it so I can keep it secured? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 02:55:20
Cool! Any estimates on how much this BTC will be worth later on?
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:15:10
Airbitz or Mycelium, which is better?
It looks like they're more than just a wallet. It looks like it's a way to exchange BTC and buy stuff. Similar to coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 06:35:58
I need approval from coinbase? How? 
I thought my coinbase wallet was a private wallet in which I had direct control. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 18:22:55

@_date: 2017-03-11 14:54:54
Why don't you use an exchange? 
@_date: 2017-02-18 11:44:18
So.. is buying gold smart?
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:24:58
Cuz bitcoins can't inflate. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:29:21
To me, selling is spending. For example, people are talking about 1 BTC being more valuable then 1oz gold, so if [I wanted to buy this]( I'm essentially selling my BTC in exchange for gold. So basically, I'm asking when is a good time to spend.
Fiat includes physical money, and thus will never die since 100% of the world won't be accustomed to use electronics to exchange money. Also, there's that nifty 30 minute wait time before you can use bitcoin that has been sent to you. 
Bitcoin is a joke, even the ad for this subreddit says it's magic internet points, to me it's just an investment opportunity to make more dollars. 
Nobody here thinks 1 coin will reach multiple tens of thousands, let alone a house. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:34:21
Oh.. I thought there was an underlying meaning. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:41:23
coinbase is an exchange tho?
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:56:18
But that's not helpful.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:30:41
Will it ever become easy?
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:06:12
I keep hearing about this etf... what is it?
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:38:15
Wait, so the guy [who made this ad for is also a troll?
@_date: 2017-03-12 00:23:50
I thought coinbase's fees were 3.75%? 
What about Bitfinex? 
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:00:37
Calling me a troll because I said something anti-bitcoin on a bitcoin subreddit?
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:33:27
It's gonna dip BAD
@_date: 2017-03-11 15:04:53
Is GDAX a good exchange?
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:15:27
So when is it a good time to sell?
@_date: 2017-03-12 21:39:56
What the fuck tell me your ways
@_date: 2017-03-09 02:20:28
You mean hold. Why are you spelling it like that?
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:06:16
Can you make your own post with real info?

Being rich is always nice 
@_date: 2017-03-03 16:45:53


Fiat isn't as volatile, which is why people like it more than bitcoin. There's no pressure to not spend during certain periods of time. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:55:39
Why would you buy now??
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:37:33
I have a job but 100% of it is going into my university payments, but I want something on the side that I can use for disposable income. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:07:55
Already have. I know the everything is going smoothly and steady. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:49:15
... ok.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:33:31
By asking him.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:31:49
But, people are showing off their bitcoin miners and how much they get per hour and stuff like that. 
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:27:13
You bitcoin people are some nasty bugs, arn't ya?
@_date: 2013-08-24 17:41:10
Uhm.. did it work?
Apparently I have more bitcoin addresses: 18YXVokrdmXKfwF4c4iJqKZiNwW58CJ8Bw
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:26:07
I.. I kinda don't get it. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:14:49
Interesting.. it seems to be kinda difficult to figure out which will give me money.
So I'll have to buy a bunch of Bitcoins with the no money I have right now, and try this. Is there any place where someone can just easily tell me what stocks the recommend that I buy.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:29:12
Do you think I should buy a bunch and resell for a higher value when they become more?
Also, why not tell me how many? 
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:17:31
Oh.. okay. Because I've done transactions before many times, they take seconds. It's been 9 minutes.
@_date: 2013-08-29 02:34:06
How is it not relevant, IF the website is offering $45 bucks in bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:31:37
Damn.. I don't have much to invest.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:42:16
I don't wanna mine anymore.. But you just said you baught your bitcoins when they were cheap. So.. theoretically you can sell them for more right now and *make money*. That's really all I'm trying to do. Sorry if that makes you sick.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:55:28
How far in the future are we talkin' here?
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:37:17
With traditional stocks, you gain very little. If you have $10000, expect to make 2000 in a *month* if your stocks go in the positive direction. I know it sucks. 1000% returns sound amazing, but getting this whole bitcoin thing is complicated. How can i make my first account?
Also, thanks, I'll check out that subreddit.
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:13:52
How can I figure out my own bitcoin address, or how to donate my bitcoins to other people?
@_date: 2013-08-26 00:42:32
Bitcoin's shitty I guess.
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:17:27
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:07:08
Ohh, cool.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:01:12
I knew there was a catch. Also I linked the video I saw in the original post.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:34:17
18, and I see.. the financial life isn't complicated yet. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:29:21
Haha.. sorry. I feel like shit coming back to one of my donators. I WILL take better care of your kindness this time, and will not be asking for more. I may or may not update you on how much I've made from your 50 cents :D
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:09:23
1 or 2 coins = 100-200 bucks, so that's still something. These guys do suck, but tell me... how many bitcoins do you have and how did you get them? From how you're talking, I think I'll get the clearest answer from you.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:41:58
I don't really care to understand the benefits of the currency (yet). I wanna earn easy money to pay off college, whether it's dollars, euro, bitcoins... That's all. 
I know his electricity is more then what he made. It's just that all youtube videos seem to convince people that bitcoin mining is actually profitable and "free." They don't explain that you need to be a *professional* with expensive equipment. Sounds kinda shitty how the videos *reel you in* like that. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:47:00
Tell him to visit this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:50:31


@_date: 2013-08-22 22:48:52
If it was, I'd be able to hand bitcoins to the clerk at the grocery story...
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:48:11
Here on this subreddit. One guy was showing off a graph of how much he's been getting through mining. Another guy framed his bitcoin miner and put it up on a wall and called it art.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:16:19
That's nice.. I thought it was free money up until now xD
It seems like a more complicated form of normal cash.
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:19:43
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:59:03
I've already forgotten about what I lost. It was only 62 cents worth. I just started this thing yesterday. It consisted of one person's donation and me redeeming my karma. 
I've tried many "free bitcoin" sites in the last hour with no avail... 
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:49:16
I gambled away your tip xD
I thought I was doing pretty good, I got up to 0.027 at one point. From the 50 cents you sent me. Got down to 0 after some low-risk all or nothing bets &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:44:32
Interesting, so this "super simple" currency happens to be difficult to understand. And I've been gifted bitcoins.. I wanna do stuff with/to them.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:32:52
How long would it take to earn several thousands in bitcoins with a computer that expensive? :P
@_date: 2013-09-20 00:20:24
Yea, I have a wallet. 18YXVokrdmXKfwF4c4iJqKZiNwW58CJ8Bw
I've herd people claim that it will multiply 10x over the next eight months, but not 10000x, so clearly the guy is joking about buying the car with 50 cents. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:49:55
Yes.. and your point?
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:37:15
I'm starting to think bitcoin users are just weird.
I just saw @_date: 2013-08-23 21:46:17
What does this code mean?
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:51:18
I have 0.00872797 bitcoins.. I don't think that's enough to buy any stocks.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:15:05
Edit: Okay, I see. Cool.. thanks. This is the second time someone gave me bitcoins. Uhm.. I'll just see how I can use it..
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:12:43
Are you predicting some type of major economic collapse of all "regular" money? 
Because right now money is still normal.. it has value and I can buy things.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:40:34
Oh.. so you guys are really putting work into advertising that people need to buy these things.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:08:11
Real money is one that is useable for all my applications. Beaver pelts for example, isn't real money (but used to be considered currency back in the day).
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:54:02
Really.. you put you're entire savings into one transaction &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:07:15
Damn it. 
Is it worth buying, as someone else says bitcoins are increasing in value rapidly. So I could sell them back for dollars later?
@_date: 2013-08-29 03:31:41
Super curious, how much have you made from stocks?
@_date: 2013-08-27 04:25:12
I've seen that website before. It's cool.. difficult to navigate, but I just read this [upsetting comment]( that suggests that investing in *anything* related to bitcoin investment is a bad idea.
In real stocks, you can buy/sell them anytime you want. What do you mean "it is on sale at the moment." Are you saying that there are times where you *can't* buy or sell stocks? O.o
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:51:19
I no longer need an explanation. I just understand that older people just think slower...
@_date: 2013-08-27 04:14:44
Could you put up a blog or something where you just let everyone know what stocks your buying/selling? 
I'm tight for money, and I've turned to bitcoins, and I wanna invest a little bit so I can end up with profit, but I understand it's risky. I can't afford to loose much.
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:06:58
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:53:35
Okay cool. Another person here said it makes them sick to see that people use bitcoins to make profit. I guess everyone here has a different opinion. 
Would exchanging bitcoins back to dollars be difficult?
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:00:41
Cool. I'll have to review this whole thread as lots of people been posting a bunch of useful links everywhere.
@_date: 2013-09-18 04:06:26
@_date: 2013-08-25 18:44:28
@_date: 2013-08-31 01:55:46
This is exactly why I made [this post]( People usually have fantasies about them kissing a crush, or winning the super bowl, or becoming a famous actor. Your fantasy is an alternative currency that somehow makes the world a utopia and everyone rich.
Only read half of it btw.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:44:11
I would go nowhere... The idea is, I wanna earn money.. not... do that.
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:31:24
Cool I tried that. It says the money was sent to it (by me) and then sent to someone else 2 hours later... 
It's gone.
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:04:38
Apparently bitcoins increased from being worth 10bucks to 100bucks in less then a year. In that case, it kinda *is* a get rich quick scheme for those who bought a bunch in October. 


Thats what I was referring to, when you guys talk in riddles. Just stop beating around the bush and tell me your point, or just not mention it at all. It sounds like your saying this is a place for idiots.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:34:00
Well, I can get real money doing that &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:46:20
Cooool. So.. with this reddit bitcoin wallet, I can now do stuff with it on other bitcoin related sites?
@_date: 2013-08-26 00:54:31
I'm don't see anything wrong with the website other then unimportant little things.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:47:09
It's a little difficult when you guys talk in riddles. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 05:34:08
Can't you send bitcoins by tipping people on reddit?
@_date: 2013-08-24 03:23:31
I just lost a bunch by sending it to the wrong address by accident.
@_date: 2013-08-29 02:54:38
And I was feeling bad about losing .3 btc in gambling.
@_date: 2013-08-24 05:45:18
Okay.. lets see if this works.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:49:14
Haha... ha. I have a job that sucks, and have done research into other ways of getting money. I stumbled across bitcoin, and just got curious because the obsession for it was interesting. You don't see people obsessing over euros. 
@_date: 2013-08-31 02:40:44
I earned my first paycheck a while back when I did my news paper route. I understand that finances are crazy and complicated, but I know that bitcoins will not be the future of money.
Btw, I have been tipped quite a lot of bitcoins (0.3 in total) since I started learning about it. Then I learned that I have a gambling addiction.. lost it all. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:36:10
I just figured out my bitcoin address. Sent all of mine to a gambling website... shit.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:00:11
I am, second step?
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:26:12
I'm pretty sure I sound more intelligent then the people who are using Ron Paul's AMA to "advertise" bitcoin.
Anyway, I'm 18. More intelligent then other 18 year olds.
@_date: 2013-08-29 03:06:15
Can mods delete this post now, for lying in the title?
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:33:10
That's amazing.. but why? Were there really 10 times less bitcoins in the world in October?
@_date: 2013-09-20 01:16:47
What's stupid is that I actually got lots of winnings, made it to 3 bucks worth, then lost it all.
When it comes to this gambling shit, I should know when to stop :/
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:01:26
Alright cool. :P
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:23:47
Well... would ya look at that...
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:59:32
I have friends who do. Just use an online broker, easy as clicking a button. Have you ever tried real stock with dollars before doing the bitcoin stuff.
@_date: 2013-08-27 01:58:43
I swear I was told mining was obsolete now.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:33:47
I'm pretty sure I can't mine dollars on my computer :P
@_date: 2013-08-27 23:23:52
[That fucking gambling site..](
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:55:38
I doubt you have to be *any* major. You've already said you've only gotten profit. So, why not just let people (me) know what stocks you're buying and selling at what times, so people (I) can copy you. :P
Also, you posted a bitcoin gambling site above. I've been gifted 0.008 bitcoins... I know it's nothing but I wanna try my luck. How can i get the bitcoins on my reddit account onto the gambling site?
@_date: 2013-09-11 23:04:52
Uhmm.. Im a noobie too :P
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:15:20
How would I ask him, if all I know is the address that I sent it too.
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:40:10
Well it's been over 30 minutes... is something wrong?
Edit: Nevermind, it sent :D
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:28:44
It's been a while, but I know that my money isn't lost.. right? 
It just seems strange when all my previous transactions have been more then 10x quicker.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:55:07
Interesting. So, your just buying and selling stocks, I have a good understanding of how that works. Unfortunately I have to have a lot of money starting off.
How is it any different if I buy/sell stocks with dollars?
@_date: 2013-09-19 23:06:34
I can't tell if you guys are half-joking or being serious. 
@_date: 2013-08-29 03:53:58
So.. it's a gambling site?

Hey, I'm here again. I've recieved 0.3 bitcoins in tips by super generous people in the last 6 days. It's amazing (but I've lost all that through gambling). I'm done with gambling and I wanna learn more about stocks.
Anyway, I came back to here to ask more questions. I looked at some stock websites. When you buy stocks, how long do you have to wait for the purchase to be verified and done. Also, how long does it take to sell stocks?

*It's not gonna go to zero*
@_date: 2013-08-25 19:22:42
That.. that is impressive. Makes me wanna get into bitcoins even more :D
@_date: 2013-09-20 00:51:49
Alright, also, a sad update. I just gambled away the 50 cents on just-dice.com :(
@_date: 2013-08-27 02:59:13
Interesting. Is buying a ASIC miner worth it? How much per.. hour?
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:39:35
Have you asked your boss to pay you in bitcoins instead of dollars yet?
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:38:57
So, you're paying off your school using bitcoin related work instead of a full time $12/hour job. I wanna do what you're doing then. I hate my $13/hour full time job that I've been doing all summer. You listed 5 ways of making BTC. Which one of those 5 do you do?
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:52:55
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:40:29
So apparently bitcoin mining sucks. Then how do people get them?
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:20:14
Yea, I read that just now. You see, I don't have a bitcoin account. My brother does. So, If I accepted it, where would it go?
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:39:51
Your username matches perfectly.
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:36:33
I'd rather be fed information, don't we all?
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:21:24
The money factory wont keep making money until the value is nothing. I'm pretty sure banks know about inflation, and will only keep making as much money as it get's destroyed. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 01:04:05
Gone for good?
@_date: 2013-09-20 00:40:36
Yup, you sent it :P
You only have enough to send to 20 people, right?
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:56:08
It didn't go through. :( You gotta type "verify"
@_date: 2013-09-13 19:43:32
I just learned something new. Cool :P
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:59:19
Cool :D thanks.
@_date: 2013-08-26 23:28:43
What's a BFL Jalapeno?
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:47:45
I wanna make *more quick bucks* with the bucks that I have received.
@_date: 2013-08-25 19:07:28
Just random assumptions to scare people I guess.
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:59:20
I looked at mTurk... I have to input my "company" in order to make an account?
What about Litecoin, which is much easier to mine?
I was just hoping to make money gambling bitcoins, or perhaps bitcoin stocks... No?
@_date: 2013-08-24 03:47:09
Yea. I was putting my bitcoins into a bitcoin gambling site that I was having a lot of fun with. I knew the address that I had to send the money to. When I was going to send my money the second time, I used the same address that I sent it too the first time. 
Apparently (I didn't know this) the bitcoin address that I'm meant to send the money to changes each time I send money. Fuck me. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:10:50
This is embarrassing. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:52:39
I think the Ron Paul related posts on are really shameful. 
Also, a different scenario, a person was mentioning that paypal sucks, and asked if there was any other method of transfering money online. Dozens of people answered "bitcoin" and they got upvoted.. Bitcoin isn't a website that transfers dollars (that's what the original guy asked for), it's a whole different currency that requires completely different methods to earn and transfer. 
The really don't need to be pushing this stuff into things that are not related to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 01:02:05
... I have no words anymore. You're giving advice on something that makes you sick. You guys are weird.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:30:23
Would it be that hard for somebody like you to start some sort of small blog where you post what stocks you've bought or sold so someone 
@_date: 2013-08-23 02:37:53
At least an explanation would be nice.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:59:50
Labcoin... uh oh. 
Is that similar to Bitcoin at all, or am I just imagining things.
@_date: 2013-08-24 18:45:34
The first bitcoin address I gave you is my [reddit wallet]( I didn't receive anything... and I thought sending/receiving bitcoins was meant to be easy and uncomplicated.
The second address (if your wondering) is my [coinbase wallet]( that I made last night
Edit: Just checked my deposit again. I got it. Thanks :D
Edit 2: Just lost all of it with extraordinary bad luck.. wow.
@_date: 2013-08-23 00:06:19
The value of bitcoins increased 10 fold in less then a year?
@_date: 2013-08-29 03:51:29
Ok Cool :P
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:31:00
It seems like it's very susceptible to fraud/scams/hacks. Because all of these long payment processes are in place just so things like that don't happen.
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:04:26
Interesting. But why is everyone who useless bitcoins retarded?
@_date: 2013-08-27 21:04:36
I do, but not a lot.
@_date: 2013-08-24 04:13:37
I think it's a bit too much work for 62 cents... I'll just have to figure out how to get more bitcoins so I can try my luck again.
