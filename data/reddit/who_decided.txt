What does that have to do with Bitcoin? What is wrong with you people? This is not an additional stream of income. It's a limited-time investment opportunity, and if you build your future off of this, you're in for a rude surprise (unless you're already a whale in a well-performing coin).

You're assuming it's not both and making an ass of yourself in the process.
I do not give a single crap about other people's feelings. I'm not the news. I'm not a talking head promoter going on tv and youtube talking about it. I left one comment on a subreddit, one which is overwhelmingly positive about BTC's future. Shut up. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:10:56
At the risk of giving a bond villain their big idea, I'll give you my 100,000 Bitcoins master plan. As of the time that I started this comment, that is $1,960,000,500.00. 
First I'd buy a relatively small parcel of arable land somewhere in the Northern part of South America. Probably Brazil. I'm thinking 100 Acres. Hell, with this kind of money, why not just buy [27k Acres]( *$1950500500*
Next I would hire 5 bodyguards. 1 personal bodyguard (whichever one is simultaneously the smartest, least ambitious and has the most to lose by betraying me) and 4 for the property. [Let's assume that each costs $1k a day and this is a 50 year project.] (
Then I would hire 3 people which would both be contracted for terms not to be less than 50 years or until death, whichever comes first. The first would be a [CMO executive]( at $300k. The second would be an [adopt agent]( The last would be a [chemist.]( *$1832754500*
You'll notice that in each case, I'm paying substantially more than the median salary. Let me add that it would be my intention to source all of these people from economic backgrounds where they would be willing to do a lot more things than their life's work for the amount of money I'd be offering them, if you catch my drift. Someone reading this comment has already figured out how this ends. 
I would task the CMO with putting together the world's best educational (k - PhD) and childcare facility. Not the world today but the world 50 years from now. I'd give them a budget for personnel and supplies of 10 million per year. *$1332754500*
At the very same time, I will have the adoption agent scouring every economically disadvantaged area for children of all backgrounds and states of physical and emotional health for me to adopt, with an annual cap of 10,000 children. To be clear, their full time job for half a century would be to find me 27 children to adopt every single day. By year 50, I would expect the adopted population to have risen to, at most, 500,000, but I actually expect it to be substantially lower.
Meanwhile, my chemist will have the very special job of putting together a) an inventory of needed chemicals and chemical precursors for a list of drugs we'll have generated in consultation and b) a 50-year research plan. I'll give him $300 million for the entire lifetime of the project for supplies and equipment. *$1032754500*
Now, the problem with plans like this is that you can't exactly get a price estimate for constructing an underground bunker large enough to comfortably house 1 million people under a food processing and storage facility. Fallout Shelter didn't exactly come with expense report, so we're going to have to free ball it here. Let's assume that to create an Umbrella Corp lab (but consolidated like a missile silo rather than with branching stalks) using local south american contract labor will cost $1 bn. That's fine, we're almost done anyway. *$32754500*
Where is this guy going with this? Is he going to run a child blood farm to sell youth to aging rich people? I mean... I definitely could after going through this much trouble, but no. Then, why the kids? Why the chemist? Why the bunker? 
Well, because I think money should be used to create the world you want to see, and I think this world fucking sucks. Incompetent people are in control, idiots set policy, the greedy and evil prey on everyone else and, if we're not careful, one day soon some corporation that cares more about returning value to shareholders than ethics is going to create skynet by accident and exterminate our species. I don't want to see that. So, here's my plan. The kids? Supersoldiers trained discreetly in my facility for deployment to change the direction of politics, education and science in first world countries and to spawn copycat facilities in underdeveloped countries. How? A curriculum designed to to boost every child to physical, mental, and psychological peak performance veiled in the guise of a never-ending series of games. Now kids, who can [melt the most ice cubes with their body heat in 20 minutes?]( Our winner of this month's book translation prize is Rodrigo! Tomorrow is our weekly competition to see who can suppress their microexpressions the best. Viable CRISPR animal modification leaderboard has been updated for the morning. Stock market 'game' daily winner is Patricia! For the teenagers, most lbm gained through individually chosen diet and team sport regimen gets to repurpose a wing on F deck for this months prom. First prize for 'Innovate this field' goes to Quinn for passing first round angel investor funding. I hope everyone is studying world economic history for our annual economic system competition (and don't forget to study behavioral economics and game theory!). Etc, etc, etc. 
But why the chemist? Adderall, Metformin, DMT, Steroids, NGF, Armodafinil, carbon buckyball pills. You're going to drug the kids? No. They're going to drug themselves based on what their chosen objective is in the larger world and what will most easily allow them to achieve it. They'll be able to select once they're 25. You're keeping them there that long? Actually, some of them will be there for life. My intention would be to cycle out the originally hired project staff and have kids raised in the program run and expand it moving forward. Expand the research and development program outside of chemistry as we gain organizational competency in those areas. The farming operations would be taken over before the first class reaches adulthood (most of them at least, I expect some of the adoptees to be late teens). Most importantly, and this is for anyone that noticed that I expected less than 500k kids but the facility is build for 1 million, I expect the kids to bring their own kids back to be trained by the facility, and I expect those that stay to have children there. 
The plan would be to supplant the leadership of all world governments, and owners of world governments in the case of any entity or agency which has undergone regulatory capture, as well as all world religions (I included DMT for a reason). Whoa, whoa! What's with this new world order shit. Well, actually, my plan wouldn't be to unify them under a single banner. I think that's naively idealistic and also unnecessarily destructive. Rather, the plan would be to develop each local geographic area to its maximum individual **human** potential, without jeopardizing current global human potential AND future global human potential, using everything we've learned in the program thus far. This is to say that if Hawaii could better function for developing local human potential if it was split from the US, then part of the plan would be facilitating that split in the most natural and politically non-harmful way possible. Ultimately this would be to support the ultimate goal of carrying our species sustainably out into the universe as explorers for the foreseeable future.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:07:10
First, you're assuming rational actors. We know for a fact that rational actors don't exist. Second, you're making dangerous assumptions about the behavior of corporations in markets. A smart company would not price-gouge and would immediately begin rerouting resources to that area for 2 reasons. 1) sales volume, 2) public relations. Demand spikes during environmental disasters and news coverage usually starts **before** the disaster actually hits, so there is plenty of time for companies to do this and plenty of incentive for them, considering they have a heads up that demand is about to spike and where specifically it will spike. 
You're also assuming that the population who needs it the most overlaps with the population that has the resources to afford it the most. That's almost certainly the direct opposite of true on several distinct levels. 
In short, your ideas about markets are outdated and underinformed. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:14:47
I'm new to this. I would emulate the supposed behavior of the whales. I'd sell out now, knowing that there will be a sharp spike and then a crash that can't accurately be timed sometime in the very near future (and there will be, which is partially why you're asking this), then I'd buy as soon as I'm reasonably certain it's approaching bottom. I wouldn't actually wait for bottom because other people would also be eyeing the value, looking for a buy-in point and I'd want to beat them to the button push before they correct the price back upwards. 
So, now that you know how I'm spending my weekend, what are you doing with yours?

Great recommendations for people who get buyer's anxiety/ remorse. 
For people like me who like riding dragons and wrestling with bears naked, go balls deep right now, at the peak, because the projections show that it likely won't be the peak for long. It might slide back, maybe to 9k. I don't think we're going to ever see 5k again. We might see it for like 5 minutes before people who know bitcoin well buy the dip and the price starts climbing back up. Buy now. **This** is the dip you're waiting for, because when it hits the projected 100k mark in 3 years, you don't want to hate yourself for missing out because you thought it was going to go back down to a 4-digit price.

You don't need to know about the laws. You only need to see environments where the behavior (price-gouging) has and has not occurred. Please answer the questions now.


Data on that?


This isn't a one-shot deal. Whichever motivation you systematically feed will continue to be in effect even when we're not in emergency situations. So, for example, when you have greedy business people leveraging their power to put greedy politicians in office and lobby them, you get local budgets allocated disproportionately towards things that benefit those businesses... and not.. say... I dunno.. levees that won't break.
Beyond that, I've already described perfectly good motivations for greedy people to help.

Then no one should ever die of dehydration in an emergency situation. Yet people do. Do they die more or less frequently of it when price-gouging happens? Any data to backup your claim that the resource allocation, and thus need satisfaction, is more efficient when price-gouging takes place? You can use Texas as your example. Or PR.


Why would an earthquake or a tsunami cause a spike in demand? Why do you think there would be a market left after a nuclear attack? Do you actually think people are driving through a radioactive zone to go to walmart?

While you're accurately describing bounded rationality, that does not make even every decision made within the scope of that rational. People can, and do, act outside of their own best interests even when informed. Some decisions are impaired by information visibility for the individual. There is an entire universe of other decisions impaired by faulty decision weighting. I don't mean faulty decision weighting from an outside perspective. I mean that people make decisions in a moment that they understand in the moment and/or afterwards that are definitely "bad" decisions or have undesirable and foreseeable consequences. So, even if we're only talking about internal consistency, When rational actor model was debunked, the model that immediately supplanted it (rational choice theory) included instances of biased decision weights (heuristics and biases usually but also motivated reasoning in general). 


Danger is what occurs when entire markets begin operating under systems which ultimately cost human lives. So, yes, your reasoning is dangerous. 


You're, and the answer should be obvious. Not every company has the capacity or the desire to be smart. Ideally, companies should operate in such a way that guarantees future, happy, repeat business. A company that does not have that interest will not use strategies that lead to that outcome over strategies that lead to outcomes they prefer. A company that's being pumped before being liquidated, for example, will favor other strategies. 


The specific context was a hurricane. Do you have any other  disasters in mind that are not weather related and would cause a similar spike in demand? For example, I do not foresee a massive act of terrorism causing water sales to spike. I could be wrong though.

So, I know you seem to think you're all righteous and all....
but here's an issue you don't seem to understand...
Obesity is capitalism's version of starvation and we lead the entire planet in it, **AND** we still have people actually starving on top of that. Instead of people starving to death flat out (acute, quick, most people view as horrifying), we have people in a state of chronic micronutrient deficiency, resulting in a panoply of conditions that are typically painful and debilitating and several of which are lethal (chronic, slow, most people do not view as horrifying but rather as pitiful). 
Don't call yourself a social democrat when you're sounding more and more like a neoliberal. Their problem isn't inflation. Their problem is that they don't have a sustainable relationship between the amount of food available and the amount of food they need, and you know it. One way to ameliorate their problem in the future is to centrally administrate a physically decentralized network of urban farms (ie, every arable square foot of land is used for vsf permaculture farming and every citizen participates in its upkeep). That would be closer to the socialist ideal society AND it would be viable no matter what the state of their fiscal market was. You also know that, I'm sure. So your argument boils down to some emotional appeal rooted in "won't someone please think of the children". You went with baby formula for a reason, chief. 


And I'm in favor of putting the rich in iron maidens and using their blood to fertilize the next generation of plants. However far left you think you are, it ain't left enough.

It's not a dumb question. I'm somewhat of an outsider myself. There's no good answer to that question right now. It really depends. So, BCH and BTC are based on the same technology. I don't mean blockchain in general. I mean that BCH is a copy of BTC. When someone copies the codebase of a cryptocurrency (or any software which is open source) and makes modifications and changes the name, it's called a fork. What really determines what makes one cryptocurrency better than another is up to the individual user and their conception of it. BTC, BCH and every other cryptocurrency have different features. Some of them are more anonymous (Monero). Some of them use different core technology (IOTA). The BCH supporters contend that their cryptocurrency has faster transactions and lower fees and that that is what makes it better. They justify their claim to betterness by referencing Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper that originally describes Bitcoin and started this entire field (so far as I understand the history here). BTC supporters contend, I believe, that BTC has had to move away from the whitepapers for reasons dealing with the technical requirements changing as the project was implemented and the purpose changing as it has been deployed into the real world. BCH supporters are thinking digital currency, the sort you can use if you go to the gas station or to get a slice of pizza, and thus BTC is not suitable for that when the transaction fees are high (higher than the cost of the item you'd be purchasing) and the confirmation times are way too long (due to backlog in the mempool). BTC supporters are interested in implementing solutions to those problems (segwit, lightning network) but also seem to have recognize that the purpose of BTC may have changed from digital cash you use to buy illegal things on silk road to another form of value storage (like gold). There is also an argument for each side about what features of a cryptocurrency end up driving centralization, which can lead to market manipulation for the benefit of the very few. 
My perspective as an outsider is that this shouldn't be a tug of war. I understand why it is. People have a financial interest in draining value to and from different coins and taking market share in the public eye. My perspective is that each serves a different purpose and should be used in tandem, the exact same way things work in our financial atmosphere offline. It isn't cash or gold. You can have both and you **should** have both (liquidity and a slow growth asset). 
Through that lens, it makes all of the complaining I typically see on r/btc seem really, really absurd. I don't care about a whitepaper that was written before this tech was implemented. I care about seeing a fully functional ecosystem of digital financial vehicles emerge and take root and supplant our current fiat currencies.

If there is a bubble, it doesn't work the way you think it does and it's not popping until we see some massive figures. This is like buying a house in 2007 way under market value and being prepared for the crash because you can see it coming. buying now isn't a bad investment if you have a good exit strategy, which means you're either prepared to sell before the local optima that immediately comes before the ath and crash, or you're ready to transition to profitable altcoins around that same time. Either way, there's at least 1 year of growth available here that you won't find literally any place else.

I like how you give away that you don't know what's being discussed. 
Rational actor model is a base assumption of traditional economics theory. Behavioral economics supplanted that when it proved that **individual people** do not behave consistently with rational actor (or "econ") models. An entire company is **NOT** an individual person. I also did not say that they would behave rationally. Companies are capable of making smart or stupid strategic moves though, so a smart company, or a company who is making smart moves, would employ the strategy I described.

I'm pretty sure that's lots of people, which is why there will be a flash crash the second we see significant movement. in fact, I'm estimating that if at any point the value drops to or below 14k, you're going to see it drop like a stone after that point before eventually rebounding.

Lol what? I didn't actually offer you the logic or evidence behind the conclusion. Only the conclusion. So, you can't make a statement matching the logic. You don't know what the logic is.

Read and reread to annotate, actually, right along with Sunstein &amp; Thaler, Zimbardo, and Cialdini. Their books and their published academic work.
So, I'm going to block you now. While you possibly have read Taleb's work, your claim that you've read Kahneman's comes off as a bit of an ass pull and I'm not here to mince words with liars, especially liars who trend towards referencing blogs and shit talking rather than generating valid criticisms of their own. Literally, your last response was "Well, I guess you just don't understand it." No substance. No weight. No citations. Zilch. Further, the strongest argument you had, which was literally someone else's blog, doesn't add anything more to the discussion than name-dropping "bounded rationality" does. There are transformations and distortions in thinking, **clearly** outlined in that book and well supported in the work of anyone else doing anything else in remotely the same part of that informational universe (IE literally every author I just listed), that go well beyond the idea of bounded rationality or rationality as defined there. You didn't address them, and my strong suspicion is that you couldn't address them because you literally don't know they exist because *ding ding ding* you didn't at the very least read the book and are generally unfamiliar with the field as a lay person and academically. If your statement to me is that there's life beyond Econ 101, then my retort to you is that there's life beyond Psych 101 and domain dependence is no excuse for being a sack of lying crap on the internet.

Isn't there another hard fork coming up?
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:00:06


[985 kg/m^3](


The technology is fine and will continue to be fine. Firstly, bitcoin isn't the only coin on the market. Second, bitcoin adoption isn't going to be harmed by its long term flaws. Most likely, it will reach mass adoption and **then** be abandoned/ repurposed as information density in the majority population increases and they move out to other coins/ integrate BTC into the currency ecosystem differently. 


No, it was for drug addicts with an interest in remaining anonymous. The purpose of things are determined by their utility. We use hammers to build things. The first hammer was arguably designed to crush mammal skulls in for food and combat, but that's not what we use them for so that is not their purpose. Right now, bitcoin's purpose is split, as its utility is split. It's half-way investment vehicle and halfway value repository. That purpose may change as utility changes. In fact, I can bet you that the closer we draw to the final bitcoin being mined, the less likely the purpose and utility are to remain the same. Something you and the BCH folks have in common is misunderstanding that this is dynamic, not static. You can't just say "this is how it was predicted and supposed to be and therefore this is it how it must be!" That's not how reality works. How many other times has that worked in other milieus in your individual lives? Let's not even discuss how many times that strategy has ended up with abject failure in technological innovation specifically. 


Why do you say that? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:24:38
We've got over a week until the next market correction. A week of people hyper-promoting BCH and at least a few news stories who will cast this as Bitcoin's demise. The price is going to go lower. Fingers crossed for 9k or even 5k before the next difficulty adjustment. If they wait until true bottom, they'll even out the spread even more. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:16:37

One person calls out someone who actually spends a large amount of time talking about bcash on this sub and talking badly about btc (and subsequently, this sub) on . They are as close as you're going to get to a shill when no one is actually paying anyone to say any of this stuff, so far as you know. And that, to you, is an example of what's wrong with *both* subs? What's wrong with medicine and cancer is all that pesky cancer.

I saw a whale's transaction history yesterday. They have something like 126,000 bitcoin. Whatever your argument is, it's moot when you think about the fact that there are several people out there who just have upwards of a billion USD floating in bitcoin. Every other quantity of bitcoin pales in comparison. So buy your bitcoin, enjoy your gains, stop complaining.

That's true about literally everything else too though. Regulatory authorities didn't actually stop the great recession. They just stopped it from being the great depression. As someone else pointed out in one of these other threads, we value inherently worthless stuff all the time. Why wouldn't there be an actual valuation for this based on its practical worth?
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:19:03
You can call it a bubble if you like. Follows the logarithmic curve from like 2 years ago to within a week of precision for the 10k mark. 
The thing about bubbles is that a) they don't last long and b) you can't predict them unless you're the one calling the shots.

Having more brains on an idea is always the best option. The time it takes to get things done should not trump the quality of the results in the majority of cases. As I understand it, crypto is a marathon, not a sprint. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:39:40
Thanks for the run down on modern instances of air Asia and a fantastic meta-example of the availability heuristic, but I'm afraid that doesn't much impact the argument. Whike humans are naturally biased towards quick fixes, adoption is unrelated to development time (which you argued). Not did I ever once argue that people should not use solutions available to them now while superior ones are developed.  Basically the only things I posted were that more minds on problems helps and that quality trumps time. The reality of a superior solution also trumps the illusion of one.
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:23:22
All of what you're saying sounds great in theory but doesn't work that way in practice. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:26:23
And it was accurate. I don't care who wrote it. The growth seems to be following a power law, barring any unforeseen hiccups in adoption (like coinbase and their IRS problem).
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:59:11
I don't think that's what they're arguing. Most of the world knows about cryptocurrency through bitcoin. It is the most visible coin and has the highest market penetration so far. It's just about hit the normie part of the diffusion of innovation scale. Everyone here is an innovator or an early adopter, especially people like you. If you want crypto to work long term, you need the support of everyday people. 
Better ideas than this have been left to rot because they weren't widely adopted at a critical time.

You're thinking about progression way too linearly. I suggest the book Antifragile. The spoon is still a pretty good invention. How old is that? The fact that every solution has a lifespan, which I'm not at all objecting to, does not relate to the idea that time should be prioritized over speed. You have no idea how long that lifespan is. Demonstrably unpredictable.
I think you're somewhat mistaken somewhere around number 3. It makes sense. It just doesn't closely follow reality. That first rough solution is **the** solution. If you're wondering why fiat currency, which has been around for several thousand years, is still being used with barely any changes to its form and function since the days of trading shells and carving tiny stone pieces, it's because it was the first solution to the problem. The first solution to a problem has a huge advantage over any advances that come afterwards. Namely, the first solution has no adoption barriers. Any solution is better than no solution. However, when you get into the idea of advancements of replacements, you're dealing with barriers. It is no longer a simple binary "Is this a solution?" It becomes a multi-conditional. Does this solve the problem? Does this solve the problem better than the existing solution? Is it different from what I already know? What are the downsides in general and for me personally? Will the people and systems that I normally interact with using the current solution also be adopting the new solution? Etc. Making changes, even small changes, to the first 'rough' solution requires tremendous amounts of time and energy **or** an alternative solution that allows everyone that comes in contact with it to say yes to all of those questions instantly and easily.
