The great thing about winter is that all the waste that is in the form of heat goes toward reducing other heating costs, so it's like being a lot more energy efficient.

It's hard to see anything they could have to gain by doing what they're clearly doing, but given that they're throwing $350K+ at it I think it's more likely we aren't seeing how to make sense of what they're doing than that what they are doing couldn't make any sense. Under certain market dynamics, someone could make a lot of money by depressing the MtGox price a bit if they are also buying a lot of BTC through someone who pegs their price to MTG. That would explain this pattern if it's possible to accomplish, although as far as I know there isn't really anyone selling at prices pegged to gox who doesn't charge high fees and who does bulk transactions (for the obvious reason that someone could exploit them by doing exactly this). I haven't really been following the OTC markets lately, but that seems like a major possible avenue of this relationship becoming exploitable by some dynamic like this bot.

If just one in ten use the beginning rather than the end or something throughout as their reference point, that still makes partial collisions a powerful technique for phishing.
My main concern with this scheme is the possibility of generating partial address collisions that are also partial visual-hash collisions.

Potentially. Right now, because our monetary base and true velocity don't compare to established currencies, we're seeing lots of volatility. But if we could become comparable to, say, Paypal's scale, it would be a lot more useful as a value store.

In-person transactions are easy to do instantly with no fees as long as the recipient has some kind of web wallet they trust, and the sender can first transfer the funds to a different account in the same wallet, for any web-wallet that verifies "in-network" transactions instantly. It takes the counterparty risk associated with someone you've just met who as far as you know has nothing to lose, and transfers that into the counterparty risk of *temporarily* trusting a web wallet that has been an established service for a while.

I don't see how a pyramid scheme could have major interactions with drug dealing/money laundering, since there are a lot of ways to wash gains you want to be dissociated from that are a lot smarter than investing in a pyramid scheme...
It just doesn't seem like the two separate types of clandestine and risky operations could benefit by associating with each other.

The deflation argument here is the standard "it will be worth too much to be worth anything" line of reasoning. I cannot begin to understand the confusion of ideas that would provoke such a conclusion.
The transparency argument though, I think is one major possible benefit of the currency and I haven't seen given enough attention: while if used carefully, Bitcoin can be entirely anonymous, it can also be used in a way that provably reveals all of the incoming funds and all of the expenditures of an organization, the transparency of which allows for a much more economically efficient style of capitalism than the current structures.
@_date: 2012-10-25 01:22:27
OTOH, it also allows for some types of contracts to be self-enforcing -- which I think a greater benefit, where available, as that makes things possible that haven't been before.

Oh, okay. So they do have high volatility for their profit margins, but not enough risk that it's actually catching up with them..
@_date: 2012-11-25 05:28:27
Huh. I just looked it up; I don't see anything from Gox about it but it sounds like they shut down their dark pool option sometime between mid-June '11 and November '11. So that does shoot down this possible explanation for the phenomenon we're looking at here.

I really like the idea of crowdsourcing this.

Unless you already have an ASIC or just the right GPU setup, that's probably the hardest way you could make 2 BTC. It's kind of akin to if you'd said you wanted to invest in a few grams of gold, and someone recommended panning for it. Just use an exchange.

If you owned your own hydroelectric dam, you could also sell the electricity at the local rate. It would have little effect on the profitability of mining, once you take into effect the opportunity costs.

A principle I trade by is that I believe in Bitcoin as a long-term investment -- so I'll buy and sell during the course of a high-volatility day, but at the end of the day I always try to keep my exposure on the BTC side, even if the market's been having a rough day.

The cultural supremacy is a little bit off-putting, and the militantly voluntarist attitude doesn't contribute to the point much.

I agree that it sucks for the legit miners; I just think the miners leaving the market would reduce the hashrate a fair amount less than the botnet-miners displacing them would increase it. Of course, large groups of botnet miners could disappear suddenly -- so the hashrate they do provide isn't very dependable.

It was trading in a fairly fixed range for some time, and then it broke out of that range. This suggests that a major marker maker shut down for the time being, allowing the market to move -- which they would have done if market pressure were showing that they'd have a losing range if they didn't shift.

This is not how supply and demand ever work. With any sane supply curve, a firm that is able to externalize most of the unit costs of their mining operation could only increase the supply of mining; by increasing the difficulty they push out some of the miners with the least efficient hardware and the highest electricity prices, but inevitably by less than they increase the supply: in a market with 100% price inelasticity of supply properties they would have no effect, but variations in technological resources among the current market make it very elastic, with the result that the supply that "free" mining from botnets can contribute is only a little reduced by the effect on less-efficient firms.
