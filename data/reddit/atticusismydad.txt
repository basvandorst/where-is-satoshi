It’s bitcoin. Not bitcoin core. But thank you for the info.

Tldr: A very well written and well researched article that clearly and accurately explains both bitcoin the currency and Bitcoin the protocol. Where bankers are quoted, they seem to wish to participate and offer their customers services around Bitcoin, but are very wary of regulators. It includes a great chart on how Bitcoin works and an explanation of Proof of Existence. One of the best articles in the media that I’ve read.

I wish them the very worst of luck.

I hope this is the beginning of a tidal wave of non-support.

I kept Bitcoin a secret from my wife for a long time. I knew she wouldn't understand and would urge me to sell with any move in the market - up or down. 
But I've brought her into my world. And she's now caught the vision. (It helped that it's been going up and up.)

I just moved a bitcoin for under $1 using segwit. Took 20 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 00:43:27
I’d buy one. Post the link.

As much as I’d like $1 M Bitcoin, and think there is a chance we’ll see it in the very very long term, past performance is not indicative of future results.
You can’t look at a chart of the past and just take a ruler and plot to the price you want. That is predictive of nothing.

Total market capitalization would be a more interesting comparison. Except that bitcoin would not register on the graph.

i believe that it’s very possible that S2X is a government/corporate takeover attempt. 
And I worry that it may be successful due to the fractured community and a fight over a red herring. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:25:13
These are not the reasons Bitcoin is successful.

So you're saying that the "segwit bitcoin" that is currently trading for around $4,500 is the free one? 
Whatever. 
Those that held bitcoin on August 1 when the chain forked, now have both bitcoin and bitcoin cash. 
And due to market forces they are each worth their respective market price.
You're making no sense son.

I truly believe if the common denomination for talking about the price of Bitcoin was &lt; $50 more people would buy in. 
But I don’t know how you get there.

Clearly a bubble about to pop.

Yep. Watched my IT guy destroy it along with some old bank storage.

Am I 5? Woohoo!

Just what I was looking for. Plan to read it tomorrow. Thank you! 
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:37:51
Is there anyone else here that likes, owns and follows Bitcoin (and r/bitcoin) due to Bitcoin so clearly being built for the new digital and internet age and not, in any real way, due to the belief that the Fed must be stopped?
Or am I the only one?
@_date: 2013-12-22 17:12:13
Order is on its way! Thanks. Was my first time using bitpay (for the reasonable shipping). So easy!
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:05:16
I think just solo. It really was a distraction for me then as my mother had just passed away. I'm fuzzy on the details. I know my email wasn't used for anything - no messages contain the word 'bitcoin' or any other related words. I'm choosing to believe I was an unsuccessful miner.
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:11:46
Just finished it - I thought I would just read a few paragraphs tonight and really read it tomorrow. But it was really well written and easy to get into and full of good information. Thank you. Worth more than the regular price, in my opinion. I've now purchased it and will recommend it to others.
@_date: 2013-12-29 17:16:05
I'm interested. PM sent.
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:53:42
Ya, really is disconcerting - the money is withdrawn from your linked checking account the next day after the trade and you get the bitcoin 4 business days later, at the locked in trade rate.
This has been my experience on coinbase. It's worked a couple of times for my though and they were upfront with how it would work.

I have a good friend who helped start a bank that is very well known. He was certain that I had fallen for some sort of scam back in August when I told him of my first buy. I keep feeding him bits of info and he is definitely interested in hearing more. He is very open minded and has a libertarian bent which is why I brought it up with him in the first place. I talked to him on Monday and he asked me to send him something for him to read. I haven't decided what to send him yet. 
I haven't talked about it much with other bankers. But I plan to.
