I've heard so many people complain about btc taking too long, or the fees being too high. I just don't get it.
Have you ever actually bought something with btc? I bought something the other day. Paid the fee. Worked fine. Where do you think this ends? Don't pay the fee and let it take a while. Or pay the fee, competitive pricing and all that, and jump to the front of the line. Its just supply and demand dude. Theres two ways of thinking about it: theres too many transactions being made, or theres not enough people processing transactions. Either way this is an inevitable place you will reach regardless of what you do. Imposing artificial limits never works out.
As far as i can tell, they charge that much because they can, just like literally every other motherfucker on the block. If you want to lower the price you can start processing transactions (increasing supply).
Once all the btc are mined, you will HAVE to pay a fee, bc that will be the only way to incentivize the processing of the transactions. This was always going to happen.
In the end it will work itself out. If fees are high it will incentivize people to make fewer transactions and consider processing transactions. If people make fewer transactions and more people are processing transactions, fees will go down. It will work itself out. If the fees are truly "too high" they wont be for long. Where they are now is simply a monetary representation of supply/demand. 
Sincerely, someone who actually doesnt know very much about how btc works and might be wrong about most of this.
