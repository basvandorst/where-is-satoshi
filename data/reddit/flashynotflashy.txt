Because it would be genius for the Russian mob to create a “legit” exchange for several years, only to mysteriously disappear into thin air once the goal is obtained and the bitcoin will never be tracked to who stole it.

You’re should already be on the Moon, unless you just bought in.

More than likely what would happen is the exchanges would crash due to the high volume of transaction from people selling, then the price of bitcoin is dropping by the thousands while you’re waiting to sell. If you’re lucky, you’ll get out with something.

Only you can answer that.

The super high fees and long transaction times are killing Bitcoin.

You’re on the Moon, you should probably sell and get back to earth before there are no spaceships left.

Cool story bro

Quite possibly the most accurate post about Bitcoin that has ever been on here.

The real key to crypto is having Lee as a last name.

I kind of miss the pre internet days, to be honest.

Kinda like the guys who only talk about how much they won at a casino. You only hear about the wins. Same with this shit. Nobody is gonna boast that they lost their house and family cause they bet and lost it all on crypto.

Bitcoin fans are the only people in the investment world I know that get happy when the price drops from 20k to 8k.

There won’t be blood, the government will just pull the plug in the internet until it’s sorted out.

I edited my comment so I don’t look like a retard. I’m not sure what happened with the misplaced words.

I don’t want it gone forever, but maybe like a mandatory 1 week shutdown every 2 months. Lol.

Believe it or not, you can be smart and not be a long time Redditor. You think people get smarter by being on Reddit for a long time? I find the complete opposite to be true, most get dumber the longer they hang out in these subs.

Why do people correlate intelligence with how long a person has been on Reddit? As if everyone is totally stupid prior to joining Reddit. I see it all the time and it makes zero sense. So he can’t know tons of information about Bitcoin because he’s only been on Reddit for 3 months? It’s really a strange phenomenon.

Can we stop fucking saying HODL already? Holy fuck it’s annoying.

I have a feeling GS knows more than all the bozos on Reddit.
@_date: 2018-04-09 20:19:41
Nobody is going to ban cash you cretin. To put it in perspective to the global economy, 5 people own bitcoin. Yes I know more than 5 people own bitcoin, I’m just trying to show you how many people don’t own/even know anything about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:07:43
According to these subs, nobody has ever lost a dime in crypto. Everyone is a winner on the interwebs.
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:04:38
I tried telling my friends this. Nobody ever listens.

Cash will never disappear.

Nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody is ok losing it all. Lose it all, then tell us if you’re ok with it.

He’s gonna short it, get out now.
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:08:28
How does his time on Reddit correlate with his intelligence? Like he can’t have an opinion or knowledge on Bitcoin because he’s only been on Reddit for 3 months? Please explain.

Holy smokes, I hope nobody actually comes here for financial advice. Some comments here are smart, some are just awful. Such is life.
