Why does your friend with no crypto knowledge want to buy bitcoin if he has no knowledge in it? I agree, Ver is sham

OP used $20 cash to get $13.67 worth of bitcoin. Smart guy 
@_date: 2018-10-27 02:48:54
I’d take my money off it but only got a few bucks on there and they won’t let me withdraw it so not worth the effort lol

Oh boo hoo, you’d rather get 68% of your moneys worth than 100%. Really smart guy

I see that it costs $1999 for 24 TH/s but couldn’t you get 2 S9’s and still have leftover money and acheive 28 TH/s? Or is there something I’m missing?

It's a machine that is purposed to mine bitcoin

People are just profit taking, you should be glad because you can buy it at a lower price on the dip

I just hope they tell me before they move it so I can put a 100x short on Bitmex

You can either rent hashing power or buy an ASIC machine

Just your luck

Your source doesn't work

Why would you even want to? You would make close to nothing

So where's the TLDR?
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:06:54
