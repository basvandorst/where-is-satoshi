Maybe not, but he sure knows his way around misleading graphs.

Too many variations. More pain than profit imo.

Irrational computation.

The US government is designed to change. Slowly, amidst deadlock. Bitcoin hasn't been around or experienced so much adoption that they care specifically about trying to kill it.

That's not quite what I'm saying. It's a system that is designed to force debate and conversation into minutiae instead of allow quick action. The conversation about Bitcoin just doesn't currently rank high enough to floor. We're still in recession, were still involved in numerous conflicts, etc. Regulating BTC just isn't high on the list at the moment as far as I can tell.

They're all lawyers or career politicians, not one of them has any real technical knowledge or enough scientific literacy to talk at length on tech topics. Not to mention our President elect is just starting to transition into using computers, and then we have the other gaggle of representatives that espouse anti science and technically illiterate nonsense.
Yeah, don't worry about Bitcoin regulation anytime soon. We cant even figure out how to regulate banks.

There should be a playlist on their channel soon enough.

I'm considerably more impressed with this than I was before. I still don't think it's a particularly good claim, but the study is at least interesting in the realm of bulk data.
@_date: 2016-12-01 08:26:53
You're weirdly optimistic about a miniscule sample size from an unmonitored poll.
@_date: 2016-11-20 05:20:23
Sounds like a story, if you're creative enough to come up with that you need to really embellish and draw people into a full shit voyeur plot of some kind.
Or share the story of actual events, whichever is better.

Now I know why you're stupid.
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:00:09
No, saved *then* spent.

Census data does a pretty good job of gathering information across demographics that can be filtered. As I said elsewhere 27k is fine for something like a medical study, but not that reflective of public opinion.
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:30:55
It's a facebook study, get the fuck out of here.
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:52:09
No, that's still spending. A sale price is not savings.
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:44:50
Did you spend any portion of that hundred? No.
Did you save up 50 pence and then spend it? Yes.
Did you end up with 100 pound 50 pence? No.
@_date: 2016-12-04 21:04:44
No this is the perceived savings of a sale, not actual savings.
You can argue the same inane point until you're blue in the face, it doesn't make it any less incorrect or inane.

Someone may have screwed up. Most of the watches on that site are currently shipping cost only.
Edit: Heck the more I look the sketchier that gets. The site has only been around for three weeks.

Things that overshoot public appreciation tend to starve in obscurity.

27k is a decent sample size for something like a medical study, but its not good for public opinion. Census data would have to include questions on financial institutions trustworthiness to get a good sample set for this claim.

To my knowledge they don't do it, you have to. But I haven't used PayPal for anything in a long fucking time.

My only issue is the hidden fees, those are still there if they're being lumped in with the price of the product. In the case of bitcoin you wouldn't be costing the company that fee, but it would still come out of your wallet because it's incorporated with the price the company charges because they generally expect a significant portion of sales to involve that fee.
Aside from this nitpicking it looks fine to me, and is generally compelling.

That's some fake shit there. Even if it wasn't, the power consumption figure is so much bullshit.

Canonically they're only there because the machines haven't destroyed them in that cycle yet. But I'm being pedantic so carry on.
