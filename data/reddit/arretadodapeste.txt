I thought the culture here was much more interested in buying a currency to use as an asset and wait for other people to do something while I sit in my roller coaster seat and wait to become rich.

It is interesting what bitcoin has become: a currency that is not a currency, an asset kept in the pockets of millions of people, willing for other millions of people to innovate, so they can get value for something that they don't want to use. For the last few days I have been wondering why bitcoin is a promise that never is fullfiled. Always a geek toy that can't go mainstream. And the reason are bitcoin users,  you are the cancer. You are the reason bitcoin will always be a roller coaster of emotion, instead of a real technology that changes the world.
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:02:03
This is good for bitcoin.

I'm not the one that don't want to understand about cryptocurrencies. But first, people from outside this community doesn't have a clue about what a "volatile currency" means. For them currency is currency. Second, there are other options in the market that offers an easy solution for these people (even if it is more expensive). I don't see bitcoin substituting these options in a broader scale. Are you going to blame regular people for this? Because that is exactly the kind of thinking that keeps bitcoin from growing.

You can always ask the devs for a hard fork in order to recover what you have lost. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:49:41
You have to be something in order to be doomed. Bitcoin has to grow up outside the niche it is locked on first.
@_date: 2016-06-20 18:46:52
I work with startups and innovation and in the last years I never heard of bitcoin again. Not even a new business model to use the technology. It is like bitcoin exists only on its own reality. It is sad really, the potential is huge, but it is locked in a community that can't unite to eliminate barriers and keeps discussing his internal problems year after year.
@_date: 2016-06-20 17:37:25
The lack of community is exactly why bitcoin or other altcoin can't be used in the real world effectively. Another year pass and bitcoin is always a promise. Instead of promoting the technology to the real world and thinking of innovative ways to really use it, people here keeps the same old arguments and circle jerk. I used to be a crypto enthusiastic, left for 2 years and returned now just to see that things around here didn't changed at all. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:11:18
Right now it is really complex and it isn't the only option for any case. Should I accept that it has a terrible business model?
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:12:39
I don't care about ethereum, I returned to the crypto scene after two years because I read about the dao hack and found that nothing has changed, the drama and the BS is still the same. I was talking about the whole marginal ecosystem of cryptocurrencies in general. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:50:01
Our vision of nicely are very different. 
And calling users a bunch of people who buy a currency to hold it, isn't the best use of a technology with so much potential, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 10:57:06
This is good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:13:54
You are the exception, I'm talking about scale.
@_date: 2016-06-20 20:01:57
Yes, I am sure that this type of business motivates new bitcoins uses. Unfortunately, remote work, that would be a nice use, is not really possible, because regular people just want to get the money and expend it, they don't want to care about daily trading and the change in prices that bitcoin has.

This is more like Bitcoin trying to confirm all transactions stuck on the backlog.

It will be a scam at $100K and, if one day that price is reached, it will be because of all the profitable scams that BitCoin is capable of.
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:30:35
Subreddit is repetitive, Bitcoin isn't, this year it reached a new record! No, not the price, but the number of unconfirmed transactions in the backlog. Congrats to all involved, price crashing isn't the problem at all.

I don't use it.

No one in localbitcoins are going to transfer the coins before receiving the money. And devs are talking about the lighting network for years now and it is not even close to become a reality. Impressively, Banks are faster to implement new technologies than the Bitscoin devs.

You still depends on confirming our ID on the main exchanges if you want to buy a good amount of BitCoin
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:19:17
Thanks for sharing! I never going to misspell Bit-coin again. :)
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:05:12
Cash transactions do confirm instantaneously also.
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:41:40
So, Bitscoin depends on the actual banking system to work. How can you get rid of the bank system, if you depend on the bank system?
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:23:10
This isn't true, if you want to buy BitCoin using money you will have to confirm all your ID with a exchange and wait for them to confirm your account. Of course, you can use localbitcoins, but it is not practical for regular use, depending on someone else to send you some BitCoin, specially now that the transactions are taking 3 days to confirm is a risk that most of the people will refuse to take.
