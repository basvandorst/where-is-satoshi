He's just trying to leverage himself before turning around and criticizing core. He probably just stole this idea for blogpost from Gregs post the other day.
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:17:13
I have similar feelings. Compromising with bad actors isn't the approach I want to see in crypto, which is why I sold my ltc.  Someone should fork a pre roundtable coin and call it litecoin classic.

Not 100% certain. From my tiny amount of research it appears to be "more asic resistant" than ltc...but Im not totally sure on that or not.

Because they want control. Are you aware the litecoin foundation promised to increase blocksize at 50% capacity for jihan to signal? Ltc=jihan coin. Litecoin did a huge disservice to crypto....we could have had UASF demo for cryin out loud.

Jihan and his cronies support high tx fees because that means no segwit which means no more asic boosting. No more mysteries about why, just a bunch of paid shillls.

You already admitted you are a jihan shill lmao. Also, check my post history BEFORE the litecoin roundtable was scheduled....100% different story. 
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:38:05
It will take some time to figure out how to easily use. Electrum is a good wallet to use. But yes, when "newbies" are using bitcoin and multisig I imagine they will not know the term "multisig".
Another option is you could get a KeepKey or Trezor and add a password to it. The password acts as a 25th word to the seed. You could then split the seed and the password. Just make sure the password is strong. This might be one of your best bets. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 21:32:43
Lol do you just shill nonstop?
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:18:21
It doesnt matter. Its set at 50% which is unecessary whether it reaches that much in 5 years or 20 years. Its the principle of the matter.

@_date: 2017-04-22 00:10:32
You're mistaken in thinking jihancoin will go up in price or gain traction after becoming centralized. If they would have activated segwit without dangerous compromises, then you would see the price going up already. Clearly the market doesn't think much of sucking off miners for upgrades. Personally, I've shifted my interest to Vertcoin who has yet to royally fuck up and may even pull off the UASF as litecoin should have instead of bending over for the miners and being bribed. 


Thankfully, they won't have the final say in bitcoin, but yes, they will probably want it to pass at some point when they need the price to skyrocket...assuming we dont have it before it gets to that point. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:22:33
You think 4 months is a valid to gauge anything? You must have a degree to be this dumb.
@_date: 2017-04-12 08:45:56
It's still a great test for segwit and LN potential and proves its security on a billion dollar blockchain as well as haters wrong. It's also still not confirmed whether or not jihan will up the hash power and keep stalling to push the UASF. As I've been speculating, I do think that jihan prefers a MASF to a UASF since UASF is looking more and more likely to be the way foreward for bitcoin, so he'd rather not see litecoin demonstrate it's effectiveness. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:39:21

Charlie Lee supposed to talk to BW.com soon as well I guess and they have 7.6%. Not saying jihan doesn't up the ante but who knows what's going on now. Perhaps jihan would rather let segwit pass than see a successful UASF on a half a billion (and would potentially be more by then) market crypto.

Not talking to you troll fuck.

The Litecoin foundation also was bribed into an extremely unecessary blocksize increase. They just did a disservice to bitcoin, and likely killed litecoin.

We don't want to suck chinese dick like litecoin did.

His job is to spread discourse. Hes an agent. Best to expose and ignore.

Who the fuck are you?

I respect for not being a plebeian. 
@_date: 2017-04-24 15:05:07
Lol. You realize if ltc came first and the marketcaps were switched then ltc would have the same political issue. Also ltc buckled to jihans demands and threats...so now any future changes are going to have to run through him. Lmao nice pump attempt though, dont forget to take profit guys.

Damn, that's what I meant to type, thanks for correction.

Honestly Litecoin should have UASF instead of compromising with shithead miners, it's was worth the attack risk.
@_date: 2017-04-24 21:54:16
It's correct to say supports bitcoin and /rbtc supports covert asicboost and shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-21 22:17:24
Back to rbtc now troll.
@_date: 2017-04-20 05:00:36
Create a multisig wallet instead.
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:38:22
You usually make decent posts but you just come off extremely butthurt  and mistaken here. Later.
@_date: 2017-04-26 16:51:32
Agreed with this completely. Also think LTC would have gone much higher with UASF but now it looks like hypes over. If anyone cares, Vertcoin, who also has segwit blocked, although much smaller, has a UASF planned for may 31st. Curious how that will pan out. 
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:28:17
Or dump...
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:21:41
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:14:37
Yeah I agree KK looks way better. Both work well though.

This fud campaign of Rogers is getting old. Back to the troll sub troll.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:53:45
Centralized banksters shitcoin just like mETH.
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:23:05
Scam! Total scam!
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:37:16
You're thinking of Dogecoin.
