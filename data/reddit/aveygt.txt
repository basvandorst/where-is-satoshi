actually our banks were, by the most part, able to handle the bank runs. its just they eventually went under when everybody withdrew their funds. they were able to give everybody their money but weren't able to pay rent once the money was given. 
FDIC is more for peace of mind of the customer so they don't get scared and withdrawal their money.

well yes, but I thought the point of Bitcoin was to be able to be used as a currency. To be able to use electronic payments without a bank. like I said, Bitcoin as a currency is useless, it is just a risky investment at this point. being a risky investment isn't necessarily a bad thing though, with a high upside there is always a lot of risk in something.

You have to report any transaction &gt; $10,000 to the IRS. Even if its a bunch of smaller transactions for the same thing, over a short period of time that add up to 10,000. Failing to do so is a felony.  
so you are correct.

in fact, forget the crypto currency

a currency that loses 90% of its value in 90 years is far more useful to me than a currency that loses 10% of its value over night. with the USD I can accurately budget how much I need to spend for groceries and for rent and gas and utilities this month. with bitcoin, overnight I just went into crises mode with my budget and now have to cut back 10%.
In order for currency to work as a currency, I need to be able reliably predict the value it is going to be tomorrow. I don't care about the value of it 50 years from now, any wealth I have that last 50 years will be tied up in property or investments, not currency. Until I can accurately predict bitcoins value a few months or even a year from now, it is just a risky investment.
I do believe that one day Bitcoin, or some crypto-currency, will become stable enough to be used as a currency.Stability will come as more goods can be purchased directly with Bitcoin, as then the value of bitcoin will be tied to the value of those goods and services.

well, I like having roads and bridges. I also like the fact that  the strongest guy in the neighborhood can't come and take all my stuff.

I realize he doesn't fully understand what the internet is. but, he wasn't speaking literally. 
I've always heard from other professionals and visualized myself different sized pipes as representing bandwidth. its a common analogy to grasp an abstract concept. yes, he didn't articulate well but the concept he was trying to convey was valid.

$500 for the feature to delete the files after printed. So your  charging me $500 for a feature that is entirely software based and should have been a standard part of the copier.
