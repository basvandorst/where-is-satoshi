I will drink to that. Then name is on my profile. I won't advertise. Really hoping we see an upswing soon, in both places hahaha.

At one point you want to buy low to offset the high buy loss, kind of like any OTC/BB Stock. The scary and intriguing thing is we do not know what the bottom looks like for crypto, nor do we know if it will rise again. I will continue to buy/hodl/and offset losses. But I wont lie and say I am not worried haha.

Hey there. Poloniex has never given me issues. CB is pretty bad on fees, but the mobile app I get BTC fairly quick and it will withdraw to my bank within 1 business day. If your account is not fully verified then this could be why also. Binance is pretty decent as well, but if you lose your 2FA with them that account is locked permanently. I know several of my clients use Gemini but I am not able to vouch for it personally. Best of luck!

Would love to see a faster BTC network

Just looking for a faster network with more ideal transaction times that wont get so backed up. I guess we should hire more miners :)

I absolutely believe we will dip below $5k. I am calling $4200.

Thank you for sharing this. I too have ended my dealings with CB. I will be sure to share this with my clients. Sadly, these calls continue because people still continue to fall for it. Spread awareness!

I just love seeing how global bitcoin is. I saw a BTC ATM in the pawn shop the other day. Can't wait to see what the future holds.

What hurts is when you own an online bitcoin casino and are already down because it is an honest casino. Then you wake up and see BTC has tanked hahaha. Well played BTC... Well played. Some say this is ramping up for a bull run, I myself am on the fence, I see us going a bit lower before that happens. Best of luck fellow crypto hodlers!
