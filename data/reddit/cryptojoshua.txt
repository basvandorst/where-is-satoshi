Satoshi most likely wanted this to be modeled after precious metals such as gold. Mining difficulty increases over time similar to how gold mining becomes more difficult as time goes on. This max supply of 21 million gives Bitcoin scarcity and value. So yes, theoretically Bitcoin will end up becoming more like an investment.
Here is a more detailed analysis on the effect of non-inflationary Bitcoin.

Bitcoin could drop another $1000 but it will re-correct itself like it has been for the past 8 years.

Transactions are permanent so make sure you are sending to the right address.

HODL for sure. Take a look at the Bitcoin history graph below. It isn't the first time Bitcoin has had a correction as large as this one.

I wouldn't say it is usual this time of year neither would I say it is unusual since there really is no definite reason for it to decline. People suggest that the price may have been slightly influenced by South Korea's new rules and Facebook's ban on cryptocurrency. However, there are a plethora of other reasons that could explain the recent fall.

[Why Bitcoin is Different Than Other Cryptocurrencies](
To sum up the main two points from the article, "The main advantages of Bitcoin are network effect and proven security. Both are nearly insurmountable advantages."

I agree, several million South Koreans, are actively trading crypto which is a huge portion of their population. This will most likely drive the market up.

Bitcoin has already had a major correction from almost $20,000 to its current price at $10,000. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. However, I wasn't telling anyone to buy or sell, I was simply stating that corrections such as this one are normal and if history repeats itself, Bitcoin will eventually rise in value.

It is normal this time of year. Bitcoin is known to go through many corrections but recover soon later.

This doesn't seem to have anything to do with Bitcoin. However, just keep an eye out for sales or buy a different GPU.

Bitcoin's non-inflationary money is the largest difference between itself and Fiat currency (Dollars, rupees, pounds etc.). Since Fiat currencies are under control by the Government, they have the ability to always print more. This means that Fiat currencies are subject to huge inflation. With a finite number of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto wanted to avoid that.

Looks like you're right on that.

More importantly, I think more people don't realize you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin. Probably why people think they can't spend less than $10K to invest in Bitcoin.

Daveime, good question, take a look at the FAQ and Science page, it explains it (and I will make further improvements to those pages tommorow). Wow I have a lot of work to do!

Considering that they hold 1.3 billion of the world's population, a lot of potential customers are restricted with the cryptocurrency ban. This can also be said for the Chinese population which is also at 1.3 billion.

**Reality:** Investors deciding who is going to tell the little girl her $17K Bitcoin is now worth $9K.

It's real. I'm trying to get everyone's opinion on the raffle so that it can be improved.
