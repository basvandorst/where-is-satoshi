Hey I'm -$1k. This is a long game tho so not sweating. Hodl. Hodl. Hodlllllllll.
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:38:52
Hmmmm. I've seen this one before. Hope it goes better than last time.
  
In the mean time I need a new ready. Anyone want to recommend some good books on Bitcoin and everything I need to know?
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:52:32
Ugh. If Bitcoin is going to be discounted so much I guess I have to buy some. \*Eye roll\*

Hey I've been using coin base primarily to buy Bitcoin. Should I be using a different platform for whatever reason? Am I missing out on anything by using coinbase ? Or am I good with coinbase ?

When you change from only looking to make short term profits to the hodl mentality dips still make you sad. Sad because it's not pay day and you can't buy anymore coin :(.
  
Seriously tho get into the hodl game and dips like this won't shake you. You'll hopefully have some extra money and can buy at a discount.
  
Super side bar: Any good books you guys recommend about Bitcoin? I enjoy reading and learning more about Bitcoin. Recommendation?

And here I was thinking the discounted rate for Bitcoin was $11.5k. Should have waited a few more hours . Oh well lol﻿

I value privacy. I move my Bitcoin to a wallet after I buy. As far as altcoins idk if I care for them. They're so many different ones it makes my head hurt lol. So I can't have a educated opinion on them, but it seems like they're a bad move. Granted I get that idea from the Bitcoin subreddit so it's a little bias lol.

So what wallet is everyone using? After some purchase i made today i want to secure it

Enjoying this whole ride. I jumped in the pool around $7k, saw it ride to $13.8k , saw it dip to $9.5k and now back on the rise. Ladies and gentlemen what a ride !

Coin base is charge a lot. $100+ for whole Bitcoin trades.

Hey this might be a bit unpopular but:
  
If you can clear $3k in debt by selling I would sell. Paying off that $3k is a permanent profit of $3k you just made. The market right now is crazy and everything is super exciting but God forbid it drops drastically. Now you have lost money to the market and still have that $3k debt on top of it.
Clear your debt then invest.

coinbase base and pro down for me rn.

Please keep your seat belt on during the duration of the ride. Enjoy the ride folks!
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:22:24
Yes. Buy and hodl.
@_date: 2019-09-07 16:50:17
On this day Bitcoin I ask you, rise!
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:44:28
  
But why did the price just all of a sudden sky rocket like that ?
