Edit: long version to cover the points stated by the banker: 
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:03:38
Stop comparing bitcoin to a fiat currency that is by nature corrupted by inflation and power hungry individuals. When you see the true value of bitcoin it won't matter. And when the global markets come crashing down your bitcoin will have kept its value and the money is yours. Your keys your money. Not like when they are in a bank and it decides to hold them to bail out the ones causing the crash. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:23:02
Not sure why Reddit posted it twice, and then I deleted the one you replied to, lol
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:02:02
I agree. And just this short conversation has shown multiple use cases for the network and that for every person looking at the technology a new idea pops up, that's what I love about this. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:21:37
2x or not. If the only way to achieve capacity is to increase the block size a simple calculation will lead to a massive blockchain, and (risking a shit storm) lead to the ever returning centralisation issue.
Hopefully the extra space from SegWit and 2x will give developers time to make LN or some other second layer technology ready for the increasing interest in, and growth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:08:24
Proof of stake. Very loosely said, you get a small fee when relaying/offering to relay micro transactions via LN channels. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:19:29
According to some unnamed guy this global warming phenomenon is pure nonsense and the giant iceberg that just broke off the south pole is fictional work created by Hollywood ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:07:13
You might have noticed that the recent and still ongoing scaling debate have had quite a big focus on mostly one thing, block size. This debate is more about politics, opinions, market share and billions in investment than it is about technology. 
Bitcoin is growing up, I see it bit like a teenager at the moment, it want a lot of things but have a tendency to only focus on one direction rather than the bigger picture, and then there's the stubbornness.
You can have a great idea and even the code behind it, but your words either drown in the noise or you choose to wait till the right moment. 
Lightening Network can work without Segwit, but not as well as with Segwit being active. I'm sure that after activation you will begin hearing more about it.
Nothing about Bitcoin is user friendly at the moment, that's what people work to achieve, either deliberately or by "accident" ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:44:04
This is future, you can't do it, yet. When the Lightning Network software is ready for main net you can. Very basic it involves installing the software and setting up your server to relay transactions via the LN, via so called payment channels, connections between people who wish to exchange value. You can read up on the current state of this on  and from various other sources, but as with everything be aware of the authenticity of the information. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 14:10:14
Can't answer that at the moment, sorry, have been waiting for a stable release. Might change my mind and try set one up on testnet. 
The idea of being able to contribute to the network in new ways is very appealing, and not having to invest hundreds of thousands in mining equipment makes the even more so. 
Yes, a bitcoin node is quite easy to set up in my opinion. Have one and a Litecoin node running.
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:58:20
When Segwit and later Lightening Network activates you can :) 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:12:56
Thank you for the link! Yes It is indeed very interesting and in my opinion the low performance requirements helps keep bitcoin decentralised, the way it should be. The money for the people, for everyone to use, not just the top 1%.

@_date: 2017-08-12 17:02:47
Google and YouTube ;) I know there's a lot of dust out there but also some very interesting articles and videos explaining the concept in details and in a more broad perspective. 
Here for a starter: 
@_date: 2017-08-26 08:53:43
This! 
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:51:42
Maybe... XDDDD 
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:21:56
I'd say depends on the implementation. It could be an app or a feature in an app on your phone. A plugin to a full node. Who knows? That's what's so great about this. If you think it should be part of your node, then that's what it is. Someone else might find another way to use it and both would be the right thing.
I haven't written the code or will ever take credit for it, but I see a bright future in the idea and hope it will help keep the network decentralised and free for everyone to use and build upon. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:13:01
In 2008 Bitcoin was like that, talk.
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:35:16
My node has been rejecting a couple of blocks today, likely the ones in question. Or maybe ABC? Idk. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:45:01

Open source is addictive ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:06:48
I'm pretty sure that when it gets to that point it will be automatic, predefined by the operator. 
How I vision the use of the network is not so much transactions to big companies as you describe it, more like the way you use cash/change today, person to person, small amounts. In the case of a trade between a company and an individual you would like the transaction to be recorded in the ledger/blockchain for proof of payment/purchase.
@_date: 2017-08-25 08:42:56

Risking to sound more noob than I am I have a thought/question regarding the block size and fee debate and what I can see from 
(If this is not the right place to ask please point me in the right direction, thanks).
Is there a way to tell how many transactions that are spam/fee lifters/mempool fillers/... and how many that are "normal" bitcoin usage transactions? 
To me it looks like someone is deliberately trying to make something look the way they want it... 
@_date: 2017-05-14 18:19:22
OMG, didn't know there were one, thanks for pointing out! 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:53:57
The talk is so much about the blocks being full and not about what fills them. It's a powerful group of people and they can fill whatever block size there is until they get it all. Unless someone change the game.

Cars can be a great investment. Seeing value purely as money you can hold would be wrong. The gain in form of the experience you get, the fun you have driving or working on the car is just as important. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:49:37
Exactly. If people switch wallets it shows the need for custom fee settings and/or better fee calculation and push development.

I never said cashing out to fiat. Notice that I also include fiat in the list of value holdings, just as stock land, cars, art and so on. And no, I don't believe in our current way of storing or transferring value mostly due to the rotten and corrupt base it is build upon.

Inflation, corruption, and factors you can't possibly know unless you know what every single individual on this planet are thinking at any given time makes any investment or placement of value connected to risk. Telling yourself anything else is like reading a fairytale and believing it to be true. The universal cause of risk is greed and being naive.

@_date: 2017-07-23 19:11:49
Very true. Fees are important to keep things running, but until we have lightening or other options for small transactions activated I can't see much of an alternative to go as low as possible. Paying the same fee as the transaction itself is ridiculous.

One BTC will be worth exactly one BTC wherever you are, yes. Every comparison is in relation to something. And no, I never mentioned any local currency in relation to cashing out, could as well be to another crypto or precious metals, but your response underlines a very important point, a long and solid connection between the word cash and our traditional monetary system, something that will change in time just as it has done so many times before.

@_date: 2017-07-01 08:39:54
For someone choosing to be as heavily invested in a technology as young and disruptive as Bitcoin I would expect to see truly groundbreaking innovation and not business as usual. We already have a system run by a powerful group of money hungry blood sucking people and it didn't work, that is the whole reason why Bitcoin was created, to make something new, something that works for everyone, not just an exclusive club of suits.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:33:52
The reason for the current fiat price of Bitcoin is the reaction of several factors. Some clear, speculation, the hope for fast return, people fleeing a monetary system that is even more unstable than Bitcoin, a misinterpreted understanding of what Bitcoin is, some not so clear, large - very large economies buying in and selling out all at once to cause a huge drop with hope to cause panic. The drop across most crypto we see this weekend is as you point out not connected to any logic (as far as I can tell) as with a stock that drops due to bad annual reports of a company but most likely to manipulation with the intent of causing this kind of panic.
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:58:21
That's great news! I hadn't noticed.

@_date: 2017-07-30 20:26:02
In the beginning. Hopefully along the way that will change. I don't know how many people actually carry around coins and bills and use them to pay for food and services. I have a feeling a lot use credit/debit cards and to most people the experience of using them wouldn't be all that much different from using Bitcoin. Small steps and we will get there. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:42:40
I have Google and Facebook running on my node ;) 
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:07:08
Of course it should be profitable and for the remaining miners it is or they wouldn't do it. 
My point is that if people only are in this for the money Bitcoin won't get anywhere, and the possibilities are close to endless. Why not use some of the block rewards on new types of mining hardware, not the traditional things we see. I've only seen one example of this, the WiFi AP with a mining chip from Bitmain. Centralised mining won't last. Use the expert knowledge and part of the block rewards in creating new things, new ideas and not just things like asic boost which is like increasing CPU clock speed on your PC.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:03:10
Take a step back and watch the continual growth.

@_date: 2017-06-22 15:44:03
The nodes have several important roles in the bitcoin network, one of them is validating incoming transactions from wallets/users, then placing them in the mempool and telling all the other nodes they are connected to about the new transaction. 
Some of these nodes are run by miners, yes. When they mine a block they take from the mempool as many transactions as they can fit into a block (and of course, the ones with the highest fee, this is after all the way they make money), crunches away and mines the next block. 
That block is then added to the blockchain and broadcasted to all the nodes the miners node is connected to, these nodes then validates this new block against their concensus rules, and if say your node is a BIP148 node, and the date is August 2th and the miner who just spend a ton of energy mining and securing those transactions is using another set of consensus rules like e.g. the ones proposed by Unlimited with a block size of say 16 megs, your node will reject that block as being invalid due to the two different set of consensus rules.
So to sum this up, yes, running a node without also mining means a lot. This is your way to contribute to the debate and show which set of concensus rules you belive is the best.
Slow down the network? What? No this is exactly what makes the network, the more nodes the more secure it is. Hack one node, easy peasy, hack 7000 nodes, naah, then things get more difficult. Yes if there is a bug in the software on these 7k nodes the problem is everywhere, this is also why open source and highly skilled software engineers are important in securing the network.

The funny thing is that if Bitmain wasn't so "mom I don't want to eat vegetables!" a chain split wouldn't happen and they might even learn about the things Segwit could give them and the network. Why be so stubborn about rushing the Segwit2X and not just take one thing at the time? As others have mentioned, they could set up lightening nodes and get fee on micro transactions besides the fee they already get from on chain. So it's not like their options get less, on the contrary.

The preferred thing would however be Mycelium allow setting low fee. I really like the wallet/app, but it's missing this crucial feature to be perfect.

So they're only in it for the money? That's a really sad perspective from their side, then... 
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:48:11
Yes, you can use the 24 (might be 12 or above) words (seed) it generated when you created your wallet/installed Mycelium. Most other wallets will accept these if you select "restore wallet from backup".
Additionally you can swipe all the way to the left, select the wallet, tab the three dots in the top right corner and tab "create backup" 
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:18:34
It's been like that for a while now unless you set the fee manually. 
Yes, Segwit and the possibilities it brings is needed, but also modifications to or new ways for wallets to calculate fee. As I see it, it is at the moment possible with the right amount of resources to manipulate the fee calculation.

Just wait till Bitcoin matures and it will be better. Until then use other coins which have close to zero fee and works just as well. This state of bitcoin is depressing.

So to sum up your post: you trust a few people with your money. How is this any different from the existing fiat system? 
Every node has users, the ones who initially installed them. Using spv or any other lightweight wallet places your full trust in someone else and not in the concensus rules. Holding the complete ledger yourself takes the control of_your_ money back to _you_, just as said in the quote you posted yourself.
But if you trust an exchange or a miner this blindly and history haven't taught you anything, feel free to place your money and trust in the next MtGox or Butterfly lab or any of the other companies who have disappeared in the dust with billions of users money. 
And the milli seconds you mention in slowdown is nothing compared to the initial inefficiency of the underlying architecture of the network, but this is the price we pay to have a secure system. Just as the wasted energy a miner has to accept if another miner finds the block before they do.
It's hilarious to see how so many people have fallen for the story that only the miners are important to Bitcoin, but not unexpected as the system we are used to is build upon the same method of unlimited trust in a central entity.

Segwit2X is not for the users. If the miners wanted Segwit they could activate it by signalling for it a long time ago as it has been part of the core client since 13.1 but they don't. The only reason they include it in Segwit2X is to make their hard fork taste like what the users want.

Time will show. I think the bitcoin community and all the business and users makes it more resilient to things like this than it was back then. When someone leave there's people who see it as an opportunity and will step in.

A mined block holds no value if the nodes won't accept it, so yes, BIP148 means everything, and without BIP148, BIP149 there wouldn't have been a Segwit2X. Most likely a Unlimited fork would have happened when the miners fairytales about only miners needing to run a node had spread wide enough and they had complete control over both the nodes and the mining.

Unless you have cashed out nothing is lost. 
And always remember, never invest or put savings in something unless you can afford the loss - goes for fiat, stocks, crypto, property, any way to hold value.

And here we are back to the old way of running an economy "represented by the businesses running economically important nodes" meaning the user, the one that should benefit from a new system has again found "their place" being controlled by the rich and important people. This way of seeing things is not bitcoin, unless of course you are the 1% 
Bitcoin is a peer to peer, censorship free, not owned by any one, for everyone network, not just for the rich. If this is not the case then the so called alt coins will get the attention from the 4+ billion people standing in line and the miners will be free to mine blocks they can fill using their own coins.
Segwit2X is alpha, code like Core, UASF or any of the other stable proposals have been production for quite a while now. Unlimited has proved a couple of times lately what happens if rushed untested code is released.
I'll be here with my popcorn, watching the fireworks.

Maybe importing the private keys into a wallet like electrum that support custom fee setting, idk

If it's ready, they have gone from alpha to release in very very short time for what has taken them years of bargaining. I'll wait and see lots of tests before I trust it.

I'd say spin up a BIP148 node to be part of the consensus and select a pool supporting/signaling Segwit. In my opinion it doesn't matter how small a miner you are as long as you cast your vote. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 17:07:37
And closed/limited access source. 
This is not bitcoin!

Agree to some degree. When we saw a sudden spike in number of nodes in the thousands and all on Amazon it was clearly someone with the belief that it would make the final difference, but as with anything in this there is no right or wrong, just a bunch of people who want to contribute in the way they feel is the right one. 
Personally I believe that it all contribute, in some way, at least adding to the knowledge of what does and what what doesn't. 
I'm not pro or against anything other than seeing the network mature.
There was a time a while back that we saw a huge number of small transactions that most took as spam, it made the mempool grow in ways that ethereum is experiencing at the moment, but it wasn't spam, at least not much of it, it was a legitimate use of a network not ready for that specific use case just yet. 
So to say something has no meaning is both right and wrong, depending on the eyes. 
I guess only time will tell, and the coming months will indeed be exciting.

If the miners just install core 0.14.2 (or even as old as 0.13.1) and signal Segwit there won't be a chain split. It's all because of their stubbornness and illusion of loosing face because it "wasnt their idea". They don't need to invent the wheel, it's already there. 
Regarding their 2MB wish/demand. That will however result in a hard fork/chain split if activated. 
Plus looking at the version numbers of the ~7k indexed nodes shows a clear trend in upgrading time and how a hard fork will dramatically decrease this number of "valid" nodes that understand this new block size and thereby centralise not just the mining, but also the nodes.
When Unlimited made rushed code it resulted in three dos attacks due to bugs that should have been found before being released. I don't say that's going to happen in this case, but it's a risk when rushing things.

Doing a transaction analysis will show what fills the blocks, and pay special attention to the addresses. Sometimes what happens is what you want to happen. 
Check the fees being payed at the moment and compare them to the mempool size, it doesn't match. Someone want people to pay high fees.
Might be, but as Segwit has been rejected for years, by miners, someone actually did something now (uasf) and Aug 1st is making the miners work fast, so it does work.
The block size increase alone will be a short and narrow sighted solution. Maturing the network and adding a platform for further development will bring capacity in ways 1GB blocks wouldn't and it will keep the network decentralised, not controlled by the few.
