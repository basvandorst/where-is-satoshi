I would say you both need to learn how to properly handle money first, then slowly withdraw the BTC in to cash and pay off any debt "if you both have any"  then Buy a home and whats left over consider investing in other investments, a mutual fund for the kid as a example and then last but not least.  save the rest to help aid for retirement and keep your jobs.

Why you may ask?  Because i could not convince my self to buy more sooner.  
And i regret not buying sooner...

Showerthought ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:01:49
yes you are correct, if you had bought through a exchange at around 5k, and now its 10k, you can simply just sell and the exchange well give you the original 5k you spent to buy a full bitcoin, and the extra 5k that you have earned.  
Keep in mind you do not have to purchase a full bitcoin, You can always buy a fraction or a smaller amount of it.
