As an eth dev I'm not sure what you are talking about in regards to complexity and bug vulnerability.  Specifically, how you think these things won't impact bitcoin's second layers?
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:34:44
If you confuse "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin Cash" especially with the new Cashaddr addresses, you might not what to be dealing in crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-01-31 17:21:07
Isn't the narrative here now that bitcoin stopped being a currency and moved to store of value?
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:25:07
I follow their changes on the code repositories and follow them in general... this is not a quick profit scheme, these people actually care about real bitcoin (cash).
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:02:41
It's not.  LN is no longer a peer 2 peer digital cash.  Every day we stray further from god's light.

What is this, if not attribution?
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:47:12
I asked the person above the same question, but maybe you can help answer, this is from the bitcoin ABC github:




It's directly in the primary README.  What else needs to be attributed?

I actually like Gemini so far.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:26:18
Why would you prefer the coin that costs $10 to transact with long wait times?  Trying to understand.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:27:24
Fork is a bad term in this instance, it's a network consensus upgrade and will improve the DAA.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:37:51
Yeah, simple mistakes should result in people losing all the money in their account.  Definitely.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:33:08
If there is no reason to use bitcoin in a timely manner, why would people hold it?  I have bitcoin only because I think people are brainwashed into thinking it has any value, but for any real world application I avoid bitcoin at all cost.  It just sits there in my wallet.dat, doing nothing.  Very much in the same way that I own Apple stock but don't buy apple products, I am only here to profit off of others' FOMO.  But that's going to eventually run out.

They're bits.  If you can store value, and have utility with it (think, being able to chip off small chunks of gold to transact with, peer to peer for cheap.)  Why would you want something else?


I don't understand how Satoshi's original intention got so corrupted.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:18:09
I'm a big data developer (petabyte scale), can you explain to me the dangers at the end of the road?
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:35:10
Wanting low fees and fast confirms is definitely brainwashing.  Core for life!
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:45:29
In the whitepaper doesn't Satoshi himself already talk about SPV and space reclamation in section 8, such that larger blocks wouldn't even be a problem?


Simplified Payment Verification
It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node.  A user only needs to keep
a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying
network   nodes   until   he's   convinced   he   has   the   longest   chain,   and   obtain   the   Merkle   branch
linking   the   transaction   to   the   block   it's   timestamped   in.

The new algorithm is supposed to be dynamic using a simple moving average, so it's more resilient to any changes in hashrate.  My concern is that bitcoin's DAA is extremely slow to react in comparison (hence this week.)  Tomorrow may see BCH getting many miners back.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:21:23
BCH was designed to allow for an elastic, more agile difficulty adjustment algorithm such that hashrate going up and down won't impact block creation time as much.  As a result, BCH would not have had the same problems that BTC has had this week as a result.  I don't know why BTC core hasn't implemented this in the last few years.

Apple produces products, generates income and intellectual property, etc.  Bitcoin doesn't do anything, it's cryptographic hashes in the computer that sit there.  At this point I've been buying stocks and crypto for many years so I weather the storms, but you're right, I do tend to shift my crypto assets from one to the other.  I'm holding onto the dinosaur for as long as people are brainwashed into thinking it has value, half of it was already divested into other alts some time ago, but I still hold quite a lot of bitcoin for now.  I still like to stay diversified in all my investments.

What is "VerCoin"?  Is that VertCoin, the one that is ASIC-resistant?
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:19:08
You're comparing SHA hashes in a file... to physical gold.  Which by all means is fine, but why would you want it to be technologically inferior?  Gold intrinsically has value, bitcoin does not.  Buy gold if you want gold.  The internet is full of mythical bits that can be destroyed.  The only reason btc has value is because of FOMO, as more people (try) to use it they'll realize how little utility it has, how unregulated and unsafe it is compared to a real commodity, and move on.

You're better off mining any altcoin then trading for BTC/BCC:
This will show you what's most profitable based on your setup/power costs.

I have only ever paid anywhere from 2 to 4 cents on ETH and never had an issue, how is it expensive and unreliable?
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:57:05
I didn't realize farting the wrong way was "posting negative things about BTC".  All I wanted was insightful meaningful discussion, but you can't even ask questions here.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:22:09
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:28:16
This is a great comment and seems to be very much in line with what's actually happening lately.
@_date: 2018-02-19 04:04:55
You were nothing but a troll who spammed them with meaningless discussion, what exactly did you expect?  If I fart the wrong way here I will get banned.
