i'm not trying to make easy money.  Not trying to make any money.  but I would have had more coin if they would have simply not allowed the purchase or told me the day of... executing arbitrary rules in their favor and waiting 6 days to do so is extremely open window for shady trade practices that give them an edge at your expense.

A LOAD OF $70!?  Which is about a 1/5 of what I normally buy... suspicious?  You're dumb.  
Im not trying to make money I'm just trying to buy a little whenever I can ...  take out a loan to buy btc is your advice?  
You keep harping on the "prediction" like i thought I was nostradamus or trying to play wall street.  I placed a $50 order the day before and the next day I felt like the price was going to rise before my next pay check so I decided to do another $70.  The $50 was fine and the $70 was "suspicious"?   
I'm just saying that if they have the power to cancel whenever they feel internal rules dictate it is shady as fuck.
Imagine I could place an order whenever I want then 6 days later if the price drops I just cancel it?  Well I can't.  THEY however can cancel any order with internal rules whenever they feel "security" concerns no questions asks...  It's a very bad trading practice.
Next time you see a property that is selling for 10k and you go to the real estate agent to buy at 10k and make all the agreements you don't expect them to cancel your contract as soon as the housing market goes up and hold out for more, they should honor the original contract.
I'm not talking about huge sums I'm talking about a very bad corrupt practice that can potentially add up when they abuse many users this way, even for small purchases.

You have the right view.  Exactly what I've tried but in the end my employment being seasonal, the huge costs of travel to and from alaksa for me and my dog, and the lack of work inbetween has made my timing very poor.  Always come into money after the big swings up or huge 4-5 day delays in finding ways to get fiat in and out always starting  a buy process super low and ending it after the hike I predicted... then of course in the winter just trying to survive is when I always have to sell due to lack of funds during the down turns. 
Its shitty luck to finally be able to have a little buying power, be predicting the market correctly, get the buy in at the right time and have them suddenly decide that after years and years of doing it this same way, I'm suddenly a threat.  No, they time these on purpose when it suits them.  It has nothing to do with actual metrics of fraud detection or prevention.

I've used all of the exchanges, I've also used Coinbase.  There was no reason for me to think that after dozens of uses of Coinbase that this one time just before the spike they were going to suddenly have an "issue" with me using the same payment I've always used, from the same computer, in the same city IP address... So there was absolutely no reason for me to have USD loaded into an exchange when I knew 100% of the time I've used Coinbase they have given me the coins I bought after the delay.
There was no way I could have been better "researched" to avoid this.  They have the power to wait 6 days and then cancel is not for my safety or your safetly or to prevent theft or anything... it was executed simply to profit and I almost guarentee this is a common occurance as they try to sell your coins at the new price spike and refund you the value it was before the spike.  It is totally shady there is no way you can blame me for this.

KYC for a $70 purchase is fascist and extreme.

I'm not trying to trade for profit.  I just want to buy.  Not trade.

Well I'm out then, I'm homeless and half they year jobless.  It should not be harder to buy BTC than a candybar or we are doing it WRONG.  It's should not be legally defined through any governemtns or regulations.   It should be a simple peer to peer transaction.  End of story.
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:39:47
Nothing has changed since all the other times I used the same payment method from the same computer in the same city.  If there was a problem they could have easily detected it and asked for information BEFORE the purchase not 6 days afterwards.  That delay is only in place so they can make the financial decision on weather or not they can make more money by calling you out on KYC rules and selling the coins you bought at profit or by allowing your trade to continue for a nominal fee.

There should be no regulation on this.  IT is a made up idea not a country created legal tender subject to rules of the country that created it.  If it's harder than buying a candybar we're doing BTC wrong.  Should not accept anyone who needs a colonoscopy to buy a candy bar.

I pretty much feel the same.  Every time I see friction in fiat payments in and out of BTC it makes me want MORE and MORE of it.  It scares the layman away because the have been conditioned to "trust" VISA and Mastercard.  They even feel "rewarded" after they card company has syphoned off 3-5% of entire nations wealth and they give 1% back in "rewards".  They make the people feel something totally backwards from the reality.  Bitcoin is the same way, the more friction it FEELS like there is using it... the clearer it is the only real choice we have for a future without friction.

me either, but if they do it to isolated individuals here and there they keep their base if they do it over and over they lose it.
I just don't like the practice at all.  My order was in at almost $100 lower than it is now and it's too late for me to replace an order.  
@_date: 2016-06-03 21:45:11
Sure it is fair.  My argument isn't on weather they will fix it if I complain it is their use of these archaic metrics and policy and laws in the first place that gives them too much control over the trade.  They get to willy nilly decide when someone is suddenly a threat and then it's okay if I just submit to them and plead to my Money Master for the original purchase to be honored.
If they had a problem with me that required I now submit verification (this is what the email asked me to do) they should not have even allowed the transaction, not wait 6 days to tell me then ask me to beg them for a reversal.  And I don't want to have to prove who I am.  If I'm not the bank account owner or the credit card owner they real owner would have said SOMETHING or blocked the acct after 3 years of use.  It isn't protecting anyone to suddenly say I'm a threat.
It wouldn't be acceptable for them to do this to everyone and it's not acceptable they get to pick and choose who and when on their own terms, that can be a huge exploit in trading a commodity like this that grants them leverage and power.

The theme here Banks have legal authority to artificially create fractional reserve credits and they don't want competition.  Every time something like this happens that shows it is getting harder to work with bitcoin it solidifies my resolve in never wanting to use fiat again.

In relation to any fiat that is printed to pay war debt it will rise

It pretty well known now that they selectively delay or cancel transactions based on market movement.

it isn't about MY $40, its about how ever many transactions they can do it with each day.

Who cares about Coinbase, they are scammers and steal peoples money for longer than GOX
