It doesnt matter. New users or curious users wont be lurking in old posts to find their answers and if you want to educate people on bitcoin and help to bolster its acceptance this helps way more than shitty memes or "i bought a lambo" posts...

FT themselves have predicted since 2013 **14 times** that bitcoin is dead. Its hilarious...

So you called out an article from 12th December 2017 two weeks ago?
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:39:33
This should actually be upvoted since it is a valid concern and very relevant question instead of just silly memes and hodl nonsense...

On the short run, supply is given. You cannot build houses overnight, you cannot build tulips overnight, you cannot mine overnight, etc... Bubbles burst in a very short time span (in other words, supply is also fixed) so the comparison actually makes sense... Also, whether supply is fixed or flexible has nothing to do with bubbles...

How convenient of you to pick the highest traded price vs the lowest traded price when the averages are not even close to those prices and  volumes traded at those prices are negligible. A more apt comparison would be right now the price is $15,540 and 24 hours ago the price was $16,101 or a 3.61% fall, not even close to coming to a correction...

I mean, what people did on paradise papers was still illegal before. They just decided selectively to not apply the law

You do know that the same requirement is asked for the USD right? They are not imposing a restriction that the USD doesnt have. If you want the bitcoin to start being treated as a currency, it should have the same regulations as a currency...

@_date: 2017-12-08 17:23:12
It fell from 17k to 16.99k so it already "corrected"...

Even if you had your money invested at the stock market in 2008, if you just left your money there, you would still have made a decent ammount of profit today since the stock market recovered well beyond the pre 2008 point.

"facts" that still dont answer the question "would they care enough to censor it?"
