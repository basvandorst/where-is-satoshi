Hi all, so I've had an eye for bitcoin lately and I just wondering if one one of you could help me.
I held bitcoin last year and I had issues with the transaction fees, they were sometimes as steep as like 5 dollars or something.
What are they like today? I am considering starting a shared account with someone and putting away some money every month but don't want to get hit every transaction. Thanks

So since I am buying bitcoin again I wanted to sub on reddit. Originally. I was on r/btc but I noticed that almost every post was pro bitcoin cash. I connected the dots and I think I'm in the correct sub now.. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:21:02
I know about those fees, only referring to transactions between wallets
