I thought the point was to increase the block size first for an immediate scaling solution, then work on further improvements and off chain scaling after.  
Which is what it looks like they are doing.

It seemed like (b) would have been useful during the last bull run, and again if another bull run happens soon ��.  
Even on small block chains, like BTC, mining happens by a few large entities.  Do you think going for (b) would make it even more centralized to fewer, larger entities?

Yeah I spoke too early, got to the Tone part and the quality really drops.  Unfortunate.  
@_date: 2018-09-11 17:04:44
Hmm, this one isn't skipping on me, there's a few hangs near the beginning for a few seconds.  
As far as I can tell, this is the only full video of this debate.
@_date: 2018-09-25 01:51:59
Yeah I agree with everything you said.  
I just don't see why it's seen as a bad thing to scale on option (b) until solutions are ready for option (a).
Edit: typos

How is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) misleading?
@_date: 2018-09-13 17:57:28
Downloaded the wallet 4 months ago and it had both bitcoins enabled by default.

Adding a second layer scaling solution shouldn't effect the first layer usability.  How could this effect people buying coffee?
@_date: 2018-09-13 03:46:12
Bitcoin Core is an alternative name for BTC in the same way that BCash is an alternative name for BCH
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:14:49
No, that's not at all how that works

Hopefully he has to cover the legal fees in the McCormack case as well soon.  
Not cool how he's trying to bully everyone who speaks against him publicly.

Close enough to 0 for the payment provider - BitPay in this case - to pay the sub-cent cost.  So from a user perspective, the cost is 0 after sending the transaction to them.  
The user of course still has to pay the initial mining fee, but the `network fee` you see listed is to cover the second transaction BitPay does the move the funds onwards.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:24:02
That is not what I said at all.  I didn't even mention BCH, thank you for putting words into my mouth.  
If you read my response, I am just talking about why BitPay is easier for merchants to use than BTCPay Server from a merchant perspective.  
But, now that you mention it and brought it up, the same flow would exist for a BCH payment processor, but since BCH fees are ~1 cent or less, it's possible for the provider to absorb that cost instead of passing it onto the consumer.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:08:25
Then the merchant will have BTC, and will have to send that money to an exchange to convert that into fiat, costing them another miner fee (the network fee this thread is complaining about), and adding additional steps/process/complexity to the merchants goal of selling stuff.  
BitPay is easier to use for merchants.
@_date: 2019-04-24 21:08:11
I mean, this isn't a reply to anything in my comment you're responding to, and just provides further evidence that people who insist on calling Bitcoin Cash as Bcash often spread misinformation.
@_date: 2019-04-13 18:24:56
Good thing most of the world isn't the U.S., limits on total internet usage sounds terrible.

I run my own BTC and BCH nodes. :)  
It's pretty straightforward to do
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:44:37
How so?  I support both coins.  Why is supporting multiple coins a problem?
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:50:06
Visually all walruses remind me of the Mythbusters guy.    But besides that, no?
@_date: 2019-04-24 15:54:26
Your post is also propaganda.  
There are many people, including me, who like and support Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) for different reasons.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:03:33
Why can't someone validate their own tx on BCH?  The blockchain is still smaller than BTC.  
Sounds like you're repeating what you hear people say.  
  
Edit: Wow, I am not attacking anyone or anything, just responding with my understanding of the world, and getting downvoted and insulted.  Nice one.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:54:45
I would have to evaluate it when we get there.  At 1GB blocks that would be 1GB every 10 minutes on average, which is already well within my $60/month internet plans capabilities, and I only expect internet bandwidth and storage space to get cheaper going in the future.  
If it becomes expensive to run, then of course I will make a decision when it gets there, but at present time, it's the same cost as running my BTC node.  
I could also run partial or pruned node in the future, but I'm not sure how I feel about those right now.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:04:53
From what I've seen, the posts which get downvoted to hell in are usually obvious trolling attempts, or meant to cause anger.  Such as people continuously calling Bitcoin Cash as Bcash, or spreading obviously false information.  
  
Of course that would content gets downvoted, as it's not the name of the currency and is only used by people who dislike the currency.  There's a strong correlation between people calling BCH as Bcash, and people spreading false information about BCH.  
  
I would also argue that having the automatic Reddit throttling posts to 10 minutes is better than straight banning people from the subreddit.  
  
Fun fact:  I am only allowed to post once every 10 minutes in THIS subreddit due to the same automatic process you're complaining about on I have no problem with being throttled here.  
  
To the mods:  Sorry for talking about Bitcoin Cash here as I know this is a Bitcoin only subreddit.  But I believe it is on-topic in this particular thread.  
Edit: Downvoted for pointing out some obvious things, not taking a stance on either side.  Getting deeper into the 10 minute throttling in this subreddit.  Can someone explain what I am being downvoted for?  
  
Ironic being downvoted like this as it's the same scenario the commenter I'm replying to is complaining about.
@_date: 2019-04-24 17:40:02
Ironic complaining about the negative Bitcoin sentiment, in a thread doing that exact thing against Bitcoin Cash.  ��

I can't speak for as I try to not get too involved with Reddit politics.  But it sounds like you're labelling Bitcoin Cash as a scam and spreading what I view as a propaganda message due to how you got treated in that subreddit.  
It's an exciting project

Micro transactions like that can go on a payment channel.  
Anything above ~$0.10 should be able to be on-chain easily though for everyone

BTC = Big Time Contract.  An item in valves new game Underlords.  
Probably contributing at least a little to the trend
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:17:46
Sure, but if you Google "BTC underlord build" you would, and then it's one of the search terms.   
Is it many? Probably not.  
Is it more than 0?  Yes
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:22:07
Maybe, maybe not.  It is suspicious that it is the FIRST transaction after the coinbase, and Tone did say there was help from slushpool to get it through.  
Regardless though, it did not get a confirmation the day the wager was made on.
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:56:58
Please don't put words in my mouth.
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:22:23
The bet was for "today" and not for "24 hours".  It's on video.   
Odd how pointing out the wording of a bet is trying to twist reality ��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:01:08
Roger also clearly said "today", not "24 hours", and the transaction with help from slushpool didn't go through until 2am in the timezone they made the bet in.  
So he didn't lose the bet
