Enabling a conman is something you apologize for.

It's one thing to make a mistake and mislead people. It is another to be completely unapologetic about it.

Well if the real Satoshi also behaves like a conman and refuses to provide any proof, he would also face a lot of hostility.
Somehow I doubt it though.

I feel I have a more believable theory if we are speculating:
There is a real Satoshi still alive that very much wants to remain hidden. So he reached out to Craig Wright, the patsy, and told him about this opportunity. Then Satoshi went to the people that would know him and asked them to play along, notice how the people that have come out have said how they are grateful to Satoshi but tend to say Satoshi rather than Craig. Well at a personal cost they are playing along with the idea to help a friend. But Satoshi won't give Craig real access to the early blocks as he knows Craig would immediately spend it all.
Craig Wright if he isn't Satoshi is actually a good patsy. Motivated by a place in history by his own words, his ego means he is unlikely to ever back away from the deal no matter the cost.
I feel like that explains what has happened without leaving any loose ends. Everyone's motivations work then. 
I feel that JVP who just previously stated it wasn't him suddenly changing his mind also works with this. The others in the scheme let them in on what is happening.

He is Satoshi and was going to provide proof but after getting sent 20 dollars to block nine for him to send back, he just couldn't resist the temptation to take the money and run. He is now at MacDonalds living it up on other people's cash.

I think that leaves scamming, theft and malware that makes other people mine.

I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you assertion but isn't this the exact opposite of decentralization. Putting the active power into one person's hands is as centralized a system as it is possible to achieve.

Good point. You've convinced me and I mean that genuinely. 
Thank you for taking the time to explain it to me.
