There are few pros and cons to everything. 
The Cons:
1. The people who didnt hold btc are being hit hard.
2. The people who were outside USA and never opted for bitgone wallets are being hit hard.(I am a part of this group)
The Pros:
1. They actually listened to community suggestions.
2. Hey they arent running away like mtgox and many other exchanges.
3. They are trying to compensate through a token scheme which is again community suggested.
The only thing I would add to this is that bitfinex it self should take a 36% loss also as they are part of this. And to ask whatever the hell happened to the bitgo insurance?
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:46:32
Yea just got in, I think its under heavy load.
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:44:43
lol. I am just happy they are atleast back.... and giving at-least something with the IOU papers ;)
@_date: 2016-08-12 04:41:39
That is what we were led to believe, convertible to shares in the future but now the TOS doesnt say that.
@_date: 2016-08-06 09:36:00
how do we check that. I never made a wallet on bitgo I was just using bitfinex
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:23:55
I suggest this also in one of the treads... Its a very valid point. I am not even sure if I am screwed yet or not...
@_date: 2016-08-12 04:40:04
Well I never had the choice.
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:28:22
This is better. So whats the plan for these bfx if you arent a us resident?
@_date: 2016-08-12 04:40:36
This is not in the BFX TOS please read above.
@_date: 2016-08-08 04:46:01
I thought so... after all it wasent their money they lost..
@_date: 2016-08-06 09:38:04
I am not a US customer, and dont recall creating a bitgo key. Is there anyway to check?
@_date: 2016-08-11 04:24:42
Maybe i am wrong but if you read that. IF the funds are recovered they will be bought back at par on below value. It doesnt have any information on them being convertable to shares.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:46:03
I like whats suggested here. Another possible way float shares of bitfinex to effected and they can make money of profits per share....
@_date: 2016-08-30 02:04:30
They are back up
@_date: 2016-04-04 17:02:03
My country politics make me laugh... the son of the Prime Minster is claiming there is nothing illegal here and all western companies do this.... the sad part it will soon be forgotten
@_date: 2016-04-25 06:29:11
hope you will give it a try :) And can be pre ordered on indiegogo via coinpayments from his website  
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:23:13
Not as of yet.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:10:05
sorry i have being buying the dip :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:15:41
Wow I thought I was the only one. But I am glad I dont have that much in there.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:16:06
Can anyone point me to programming guide to rsk?
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:54:11
There is only one way to find out... haha. However on verification they are giving away dgb so really dont need to deposit anything.
@_date: 2015-06-11 05:01:42
While you have hit general concepts let me give you an example. Lets say I wanted to buy online from my credit card(paypal is not supported in my country). I will have to call up my credit card company and tell them I have to buy online and to activate my card for certain time and they charge for this security feature. Then when I do buy online if the usd rate is lets say 100 then I would be charged 102 to 103 and  goes even higher if we are buying something in euro or euroany other currency. So it not only saves time but saves money. For the first time in my life I used bitcoin with expedia and its a match made in heaven for frequent travllers hopefully they will start accepting btc for everything soon.
@_date: 2015-06-27 18:11:58
The thing I tell everyone its not just about buying and hoarding. Please tell people about it. The more people that use it and know about it the better chance you will have for early retirement ;) but seriously we have to get the word out. I told a trader in my country to use it, he bugged me for 3 weeks before he decided to risk it but he had to convince his vendor also, he later took the risk and made his first buy and payment, now the scared vendor is like you should make more payments like this and he is always on the lookout to buy bitcoins to make payments ....
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:35:03
Same here. Its funny I explain them the concept every now and then they still end up getting confused. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:34:23
You wanna scare him some more show him this:
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:20:56
You have to realize. Before a new currency is born we see someone generally govts enforcing its use. With  it came first and acceptance has just started and that too voluntarily so its only a matter of time. 2 years ago there were only bitcoin exchanges and little acceptance. 1 year ago was the age of atm,  Today ms, dell overstock etc accept it. This is only the beginning.
Remember before internet there was fax then  then email then internet and imIbbsimhat replaced it. Its evolution it takes time.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:16:33
I read somewhere of a suggestion for a dynamic block size which I think is more suitable if it can be inbuilt into the code. Its not just china most 3rd world countries cant do it and are capped on size.
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:44:07
While I do believe bitcoins should be used. The thing is it doesnt cost a dime to support bitcoin payment acceptance. yes a site that is built around only bitcoin might fail to keep up with maintenance cost but the sites like newegg etc will should not have a problem. Recently I read that Expedia had received payments over what they anticipated and to add to that total I booked 3 hotels through them with bitcoin just to see how good it worked. So far cant complain.
@_date: 2018-09-15 18:26:20
true.. but isnt that how centralized exchanges work?
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:00:55
Hey. Your users will need to register with us. But we run  and  the later being what you can use to get btc converted to fiat. Your receivers can register with us and verify themselves. We are fully functional bitcoin trading platform for Pakistan. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 02:14:57
Thanks for rating us higher. Yes we opened back around 7 months ago and since then trying to move up. Market data which is for 24 hours can be found at the following link:
We do on avg about 3 btc now daily as we have seen steady growth. 
We dont do otc trades and believe in proof of reserve so our coldwallet is listed on our website for verification.
@_date: 2018-05-31 07:13:51
That sucks.
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:16:32
@_date: 2018-08-04 04:39:50
From Pakistan. 3rd world countries are charged market plus 3% plus an additional tax of 1%
@_date: 2018-08-04 04:00:05
In my experience you are charged atleadt 4% when using credit card. Last time i got robbed and lost all funds including cc so having something like this is a game changer. Is this confirmed news who is the merchant?
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:42:53
I used to use this on my mobile alot. Any suggestions on a replacement?
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:30:50
Not blaming anyone just looking for alternatives. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:08:59
At this gas station you can.... ;)
@_date: 2014-11-18 17:15:09
Nice. Whats the cost.
@_date: 2014-10-05 05:17:44
thanks now I am not sure if I should risk it as I have some funds sitting in payeer that I would like to it to btc. Maybe I should just wait. This happened at btc-e before also but it came back online.
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:40:59
You can buy/sell bitcoins or use them for gas. The Idea presented here is to promote bitcoin and nothing more. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:59:47
Thanks for the explanation. One question i have is why does the margin rates or interest on loan rates spike when the price goes up shouldnt they be lower by above standard?

 Bitcoin exchange in pakistan
@_date: 2014-05-09 07:01:23
you can check bitcoinpk.com or coinsafe.com and buy from atm's listed on there.
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:44:22
Why do you say that? If you read the article you will come to realize that the biggest bitcoin nation is also the biggest trade partner of Pakistan(China) and Pakistan always have to take loans on to keep up reserves and due to trade imbalance. The Potential of this is huge.
@_date: 2015-05-03 06:45:30
I am running bitcoin.com.pk would love for you to write there.
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:13:36
So just to get this right. I am using a non coinbase wallet. When I send them funds do I add 0.0001btc to the total i am sending or they have already factored that in at their end?
@_date: 2015-05-29 05:54:39
Well I selected us site and then selected to pay via bitcoin. They didnt have anything against it. If they accept credit cards overseas why wouldnt they accept bitcoin? Now you are scaring me....
@_date: 2015-05-25 08:00:11
Where else can I use bitcoin in turkey heading for a vacation to Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya....
And if you stop by in Karachi Pakistan be sure to look me up would love to hang around with you guys while you can pay me for fuel in bitcoin ;) 
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:33:08
This is Danyal Manzar I am the co-owner of Urdubit.com. I understand your point. And we at Urdubit want to make sure that doesent happen. To that we will be doing verification of each and every user in Pakistan. You have realize the upside to this is enormous. Right now there are millions of people who cant target oversea markets due to no Paypal acceptance, and to provide small markets international access is something Pakistan is in need of right now.
@_date: 2014-11-19 04:04:13
Yes that is what it means. BTC is accepted for CNG, Petrol, Diesel and lubricants at this station.
@_date: 2015-05-29 05:57:18
Yep I know. Its just that I am the owner of the exchange ;) but the bitcoin withdrawals we have are fully automated so no worries.
@_date: 2014-09-12 05:36:00
We recently started operating in Pakistan. Currently we have 2 locations one is in Rawalpindi and one is in Karachi. You can check bitcoinpk.com for our bitcoin locations. We are working with coinsafe so we work like an ATM. You can call ahead if you are looking to buy or sell. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:25:02
wow this is excellent. And was fast. Bitcoin always amazes me. I used to use agoda for booking with credit cards before. Had to pay extra conversion rates for those I think I just saved atleast 60 dollars in conversions alone. Thanks alot guys. Just to update those who want to book the same. You have to add the network fee to pay them. I  had to pay them 4.0513 so I send a total of 4.0514 and they received the exact amount.
@_date: 2015-05-17 09:42:41
Please get in touch with us at support We do support multiple merchants in one country. For the exchange we use for reference is:  for malaysia. For Pakistan we use 
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:17:52
You can try many money exchangers in Pakistan. There is also the only bitcoin exchange in Pakistan 
@_date: 2017-02-02 04:08:17
Currently looking into run of the river. We plan to setup small setup where 70% of the power is given out to the locals, balance is used for mining, the heat generated from this (or hot water not sure which we decide yet) to the local resorts as they have to cut down trees and burn them due no electricity or gas. 
@_date: 2016-03-22 17:26:52
Granted i am not in the us. I did use urdubit for round $4000. But since they closed my accout after shifting i haveen using bitfinex. I might wire money to bitfinex soon lets see..
@_date: 2015-05-28 20:30:21
In their terms if we overpay it wont be accepted either. As I mentioned I was charged 0.0001 btc for withdrawal from my exchange so I just added that to the total amount.
@_date: 2015-01-05 06:42:31
So anyone see this yet? I was following xpy closely and I for one vouch that he did commit that he will buy back xpy at $20 to keep the price stable if sellers dump.
@_date: 2014-09-12 05:25:48
Check bitcoinpk.com and coinsafe.com
@_date: 2015-05-17 09:24:50
Thanks for checking and posting that. Please take note that we are using local exchanges in requisite countries to display the fees. We will be clarifying all fees for all countries soon. In the mean time you are more then welcome to email us to get details per region.

yeh was looking into that too I already booked the international flight. Will see if I can use them for internal turkey flights.

@_date: 2016-03-09 03:34:08
That is very well said. Its a good in-depth explanation of how swift works as opposed to bitcoin. The issue here we dont realize is that all transactions on swift messages are done via Dollar which is the reserve currency of choice. To think that banks will let bitcoin become that currency is something I personally dont see happening. Atleast not right now. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:20:32
Same here
@_date: 2016-03-09 03:35:37
Its not just the size of the block. A bank will not choose to lose value of currency while waiting for transmission no matter even if the transaction is 10 mins long. This is why they explore the private chains rather then bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-05 06:14:32
Well, we are talking about a grant, and we are not giving it away, it will be sold at almost cost to these guys because its a poor area with no electricity. The heat will be sold to resorts also. Thats the plan though lets see. Will be in Pakistan. 
@_date: 2016-01-21 04:23:23
I think its a retail store they allow 1 order. What item are you looking at?
@_date: 2016-03-27 14:44:47
Well for these guys coinpayments was better as coinbase and bitpay is not worldwide. They had to do manual cashouts but now they are also holding btc cause for them it was cheaper then credit card. I am going to get them onto openbazaar also.
@_date: 2016-01-09 08:31:45
The site is running not sure whats going on. I dont have funds there so cant say for sure if they are about to run.

Applied to be a teller a month ago, no tellers in my country. Not even a single email reply back. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 10:44:19
Agreed. They have to build on btc
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:44:42
While you will lose money, you can buy mining at nicehash.com and point it to segwit pool.
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:07:39
K they got converted into uphold, the question is do they still peg the value of bitcoin or allow that?
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:49:47
I agree. But they are feeding on low income low country people. How do we get them to stop. And they do it in the name of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-25 00:15:22
Hey dan, i was excited about your project, i am in discussions to see if how we can use renewable energy to do this. Just wanted to let you know I don't post much due to arguments but love to read and learn and these reddits are helpful. I am kind of glad that someone challenge you this way we get to see more of your operations. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 12:17:19
NO we are not supporting bcash. My point on that post was excatly that I mean if segwit2x takes the blocksize to 8mb there is already bcash so you can see the support on that so there is no point for another fork of 8mb.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:23:55
Hackerone pays in btc
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:33:32
we need to stop alot more then that. Onecoin is like the Anti Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-08-10 09:31:17
I personally havent responded to this as we are still undecided but we are leaning towards original core chain also as we dont believe its required right now to push to segwit2x. We will however implement what the majority decides. 
Another question is if we already have bcash then why do you need another version of btc to support 8mb again? werent they against segwit to begin with and just went along because of the 2x agreement. 
My understanding of LN is not there yet however I do believe its great for micro payments only between trusted parties, I may be wrong.
@_date: 2017-01-11 06:49:01
I wanna buy these prefunded ones with a credit card lol

@_date: 2017-08-10 12:19:51
Actually after I posted it I realized it doesnt really make sense hiding it as you can check from my history. So no harm done :) 
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:12:42
Also a question is there a statement why the hell antpool mines empty blocks? And if we cant really clear backlog then there is no benefit to end consumer. As transactions will still be costly and slow. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 17:47:43
@_date: 2017-08-11 04:25:01
Could you tell me which pools are mining bcash?
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:12:20
Am I the only one interested to see the increase in tx through put rather the  price?

@_date: 2018-06-02 17:10:14
Interesting. Is there a place where i can find out about all crypto accepted places in turkey?
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:21:13
I meant I am not in USA.
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:08:58
I see as i saw hotels.com there as giftcard. Not in USA though.
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:19:57
I recently took a course in digital money with them and they are toying with the idea around bitcoin and money as service by banks rather then it being controlled by one.
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:03:33
Their twitter account simply replied to me stating that they dont take responsibility for coinbase being active lol. So I guess its a closer which sucks.
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:52:49
You guys have to realize markets dynamics, most of the trades in Pakistan are done off the books through personal contacts and on facebook groups. urdubit and lbc combine for 25+ btc a day and I believe the word of mouth/direct trade is bigger and so the exchanger market in facebook.
@_date: 2018-06-01 05:48:20
This is why I am asking. Will be booking today hopefully it will go smooth. Dont think have many options. 
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:10:47
This is interesting. How can we collaborate. I would like offer this also.
@_date: 2016-12-01 11:44:51

I have read very bad reviews on this have you tried this?
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:59:02
Weird I was never upvoted have been asking around for sometime about this and confimed this long time back. I am on my vacation now had to pay in fiat. I did however risk is destinia on one booking will let you know how the exp was after i check in/out of that hotel.
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:24:19

Yeh same here. Bitrefill offers flights and hotels? didnt know.
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:04:10
Same here not sure what to do. Am checking cheapair also.
@_date: 2018-06-17 08:59:03
My personal thoughts is that btc is falling due to banking crackdown. Pakistan, India(even though it seems this will be reversed.), China, Bangladesh, Iran and many other countries central banking has banned/closing accounts of crypto traders. Once a solution is found(while some may argue decentralised exchanges, localbitcoin as solution) it will spur fresh investments and improve inwards money. While many will disagree, I still believe that a hefty amount of holders took an exist in these countries as they need to cash out the bitcoins and other crypto.
@_date: 2018-06-01 17:20:56
you are right. SBP has banned banks from processing transactions. And banks are closong accounts if they find out that you are using their credit debit or accounts for sale purchase of btc
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:46:22
@_date: 2015-08-13 01:00:53
miners in third world countries have limited speed hence the larger block size will render miners from these countries out creating a centerized structure. Not sure if this is possible cant we have a dynamic blocksize which scales with need? Also I am no expert but the confirmation on blocks are like in the 100+ range cant we just lower that to some 20 to 30 confirms to reduce the burden since the network is already strong enough we shouldnt require so many confirms. Again I am no expert but these are my views?
@_date: 2015-08-15 06:38:06
I am sorry cheap electricity??? We pay 20 cents plus per unit which amounts to 200 dollars per month with good the good salary of $12000 dollars per anum. Its not cheap by any means.   
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:14:59
Yeh me too then 5100 then 6100 same thing lol
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:10:45
You guys need start marketing yourself more. 
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:36:47
Well the block size will be reduced since confirmations will be less. And the people get paid in fiat need to pay bills in fiat also. With bitcoin waiting a day means you can lose 40% of value.
@_date: 2015-08-13 04:36:15
Yes you are right. But in Pakistan its going backwards and becoming more exp. So I am talking with my exp here not other countries.
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:14:39
k thanks didnt know that I though the block size was dependent on number of confirms also as miners would have to put in more effort and data for multiple confirms. Thanks for clearing that up.
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:01:18
so you would rather have bitcoin to centralized setup. 
@_date: 2015-08-18 12:44:37
I think there are bigger things happening here. I am not going to say if we should move to xt or not as everything has been discussed way too many times. 
This war between the devs is what makes all this interesting. The result of this will define on which path bitcoin goes, and who really controls bitcoin the people or the select few.  This is also why I believe bitcoin will win in the end. An old friend contacted me the other day and wanted to learn about bitcoin he got hung up on the fact that what if the 21million number is changed how can that be assured that it cant be changed. I believe whats happening right now between xt and core will show if that can be done and will show us which path bitcoin goes.
@_date: 2015-07-18 03:39:40
The pakistani communtiy thread is active here
But most Pakistani use facebook so look for bitcoin Pakistan group. Bitcoinpk. There is soneone runninf bitcoin foundation page on facebook also. A few sites in Pakistan also accept bitcoin  I personally accept btc for CNG and Petrol/Diesel.

yeh man i want them free coins ;)

Cant you just save wallet.dat file and put that on new core wallet and sync that on new system?
@_date: 2015-07-26 10:04:17
I talked to them they said they will be adding logos soon but when you go to check out they are accepting bitcoins
@_date: 2015-07-26 15:18:36
Do you guys work in Pakistan? just need bitcoin acceptance.
@_date: 2015-08-18 13:13:34
we never thought bitcoin will split either.... Although I agree with you on the size but never say never ;)
@_date: 2015-07-06 05:52:41
My answer to that question:
An Entity, A Person, A Myth, A Legend...
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:46:13
There are exchangers here. Addtionally localbitcoins.com and urdubit.com are options here in Pakistan.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:44:02
You nerd to disable and then re enable your account.
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:05:53
And added that as I said I am no expert but doesnt more confirms mean more blocks filled up? 
@_date: 2015-07-10 23:18:53
No one is saying this but did you see the jump in btc with the drop in ltc  price at the same time? It might have been heavy buying back. Someone playing the markets
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:22:42
Hey Asim hope you do give us a try. We have been running since 9 months we have gone from having 1 btc trade per month to 4 plus btc per day.Yes we are small as the Pakistani market in terms of bitcoin is small. But with the growing trend we hope we will get there. As for us being legit our addresses are listed. You can check  additionally once verified we give you Rs100 to get started so there is really nothing to lose. Our numbers are listed on the website so contact us anytime. :) 
P.S Eid Mubarak

In a land of economic slavery yes ;)
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:42:04
Great to see more people come on board.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:18:32
Actually there were multiple users who reported this.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:17:29
Sorry will keep that in mind. I know someone who had this happen. And it was posted in the msg section on hashnest.com

@_date: 2016-02-15 12:08:07
Its sad to post this but its happening....
@_date: 2016-02-19 05:53:19
try itbit also
@_date: 2016-02-29 06:32:04
Is this bitfinex? This usually happens with electrum wallets I think, someone I know sent ltc to btc address on bitfinex
@_date: 2016-09-05 06:33:38
They got azure and are shifting to that ...
@_date: 2016-09-27 05:41:44
Your contact us forum is not working. Trying to send you an email. Secondly I agree try to incorporate atleast.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:55:56
I have to agree. A ban is not a good thing. A major investment nation goes out of the picture. The issue here is that other countries might follow.
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:11:38
Man you guys and these negative bch posts. You need to stop. All I know is i got free coins as dividend to my btc and i expect another one at 2x. Made a good couple of btc dumping them at $900 in value. So please let the 2x divdened come in so I can go on another vacation.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:43:08
So its free but you have pay a fixed fee of $4???
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:13:40
Its about the post. The title should not have free. In anycase its i believe this is a good tool that should be there. And fees at $4 are good imo.
@_date: 2018-07-24 09:48:22
regardless of the transaction increases the price increase will cause the transcation fee higher as the satoshis will be more valuable.
@_date: 2015-04-13 04:54:52
Thanks for your trust in us. Its users like you that keep us going....
@_date: 2018-07-09 04:49:15
have you used them?
@_date: 2018-07-05 08:34:04
Havent read this but I know a friend who had a similar problem. How it happened is quite interesting. The hacker actually had access to the account the trading feature but not the withdrawal so he basicaly put up the btc for sale with a coin that is low volume and not traded. The lasp is at user end not the exchange in this case.
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:33:14
Well you did get alot of forks of bitcoin so technically you can account those as dividends lol
@_date: 2015-04-20 09:39:36
whats the website of this bitsim... where can I order one?
@_date: 2015-04-13 04:54:07
Sorry I have been away. We do follow KYC. But currently Pakistan doesnt have any laws on BTC so we are not bound to report him. However if we suspect any wrong doings we might have to report him. Do take note bitcoins are just software so trading in software so far in Pakistan is tax free.
@_date: 2015-04-09 04:10:42
Co founder of urdubit here. Thank you all for those who have referred to us. We would gladly work with you to solve your problem. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:42:34
Isnt Chinese government doing that already? 
@_date: 2015-09-18 07:19:58
You do have a point this is also why I wanted to use an escrow type service maybe. I just wish there was a bitcoin ebay that was trusted and running. I have seen far too many fail. It helps 3rd world countries access to the international space also cuts down on the profits of the big companies that tend to buy from where peer to peer things cant be bought. Looked into Etsy will give that a go not sure how popular that is.
@_date: 2015-09-16 04:44:54
The problem is that Pakistan is not supported by most countries. Hence I cant have an account on places like amazon and ebay. And even if I somehow am able to get them an account they cant receive payments here. There used to be onewallet that were like ebay but I think they shut down.
@_date: 2015-09-22 05:10:44
Surprised to see this go down the path of changetip and exchanges. Please guys what I am trying to say here is that we need to educate the masses as much as we can on the risk of mlm type coins. These coins promote that I buy and sell 1000 coins so I get 10 coins free type setups... and they are holding their conferences in 5 Star hotels. I know greed is the main driving factor but their problem is also causing spam as people are sending hardly transactions fee worth of coin on the bitcoin blockchain. And in return doing nothing but losing due to greed. I do feel sorry for them thats why I posted this here.
@_date: 2015-09-16 04:54:49
Forgot about Craigslist. Will try that.
@_date: 2015-09-07 07:36:52
Thanks I will check it.
@_date: 2015-09-30 03:03:25
I like this. Good job. I do hope you are able to sustain running it.
@_date: 2016-10-30 05:10:39
Congrats keep going.
@_date: 2016-10-06 03:55:05
This is excellent. I would be following you keenly something I had been looking for.
@_date: 2015-11-22 11:09:56
Also contact coindesk newsbtc and cointelegraph
@_date: 2018-07-09 17:41:36
Thanks for the info will give it a go next time.
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:57:19
Blossom finance news is nothing new. Secondly the problem is there is more than just one rule of law in the islamic world. As far as i can remember Turkey, Egypt leading scholors have given a negative statement. One group from Pakistan has declared it haram also. Again its different standpoint by different scholors. But some have based it on their understanding of onecoin.
@_date: 2015-11-22 11:09:09
Reddit and a-ads.com
@_date: 2018-04-30 05:04:34
Agreed. This is still a long way. But it will happen regardless in due time with understanding.
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:25:59
They were working with SCB as far as I know. I had been using them for 6 months no issues.
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:24:48
Yea they gave me hardly 3 days I was able to pull out funds. But honestly gotta thank them. In haste I pulled the trigger and bought btc at 290 ;) unloaded them at bitfinex already...
@_date: 2016-05-10 10:33:13
Thats good to know... but it would be nice if just accepted it directly wouldnt it?
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:24:24
Nope they are closing doors in Pakistan. As a Pakistani you cant even open a new account. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:27:57
Honestly they got me because they were very nice and very helpful. I had an account at bitfinex and thats still active even though I had never used them just verified it and left it open. Switched to them now.
@_date: 2015-10-27 11:52:32
Pakistan. I tried doing a new signup and they said they are not accepting registrations. Same thing happened with my friends account
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:33:00
buttcoiners lol seriously is that a problem in every language?
@_date: 2015-10-28 16:25:24
I guess I have to agree with dsterry on this. Plus its not just me my friends that I bought on there had the same email sent.
@_date: 2015-02-02 08:38:19
We have been actively trying to create awareness Pakistan. We would gladly like input from the community on how we should go about teaching people. We started the first session which was free of cost which teaches what blockhain is what bitcoin is how to use it. Next session will be on mining, trading and using it as board-less currency. We are looking for any form of help anyone can provide in this regard. We will also be giving away a small deposit of PKR100 to attendees on  so they buy some btc and learn how the entire thing works.  
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:42:11
So this also means that mtgox was really hacked and mark didn't really have the funds? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 07:47:59
Update of the first session we did.
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:46:15
This should be good.
@_date: 2017-06-23 13:05:02
Pakistan 
@_date: 2017-06-24 17:32:37
Agreed should have kept reading. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:06:45
I use coinhills.com and on android i add bitcoin checker app. Also exchangewar.info
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:42:13
This is quite old was taken in 2014. Its in Karachi on one gas station.

When I read bitcoin may go away but blockchains are here to stay, I stop reading. Then to add to that it goes onto to say that it is merely a speculation and trade for profit, makes me even more of the view that the writer hasent even been to a underdeveloped or 3rd world country. I for one running a local exchange have see people who are severely disadvantaged due to restrictive banking,using bitcoin to open themselves to the world and allowing themselves to open trade barriers and service barriers. They now have a way to easily provide and become part of world economy as apposed to living in poverty. Example a software developer living in a country where piracy is a norm and governments close eyes on pirated software. A small scale handicraft maker  selling $100 item and not having to pay $77 on bank wire. A small town teacher teaching 1 hr a day in his spare time at $50 a month. A person able pay for his website or a student to pay for a game. This is what bitcoin is, and its only tip of the iceburg.
