He didn't actually have the 9 BTC on the exchange when it got hacked.
@_date: 2016-08-03 10:06:50
You should be alright. They'll treat it as if you deposited after they shut down deposits and withdrawals. When they get back up and running, you will have access to the 9 BTC. I recommend withdrawing ASAP though.

@_date: 2014-12-30 09:51:34
**Many people here seem to have written huge long articles over this topic. I'll attempt a short answer.**
Sending bitcoins to someone is instant, but when they are first received you are vulnerable to a double spend. This is why some companies prefer to wait the hour or so it takes the transaction to be fully confirmed, Trezor included.
The majority of companies don't care about confirmations due to how unlikely the transaction was a double spend. In any case, they could always sort it out later.
After around 6 confirmations the transaction is considered to be as good as a 6 month old credit card transaction. I wouldn't be worried as in usual day to day use it isn't a problem.
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:19:03

It is a truly fantastic story too, nothing to do with bitcoin, but well worth a play.
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:28:45
Ahem, first off, I got started with bitcoin when I was about your age and was also exited to mine. I soon realised however that without spending literally thousands of dollars every year I wasn't going to make anything.
This is because it is extremely difficult for computers to mine bitcoin nowadays due to the high difficulty. Without ASIC's (application-specific integrated circuits) it's near darn impossible.
Your best bet would be just to buy some online. It's fairly easy now through sites like circle, coinbase and bittylicous (just to name a few).
I recommend not buying more than you can afford to lose as the price can sometimes swing quite dramatically. It is a good investment in the long run however, no doubt about that.
**tl;dr: Don't bother mining, just buy some. :D**
EDIT: What ever you do, DON'T STORE THEM ONLINE!

All being in Mensa means is that you are £54.95 worse off every year. It is pointless and joining just proves you aren't really that smart. 
High IQ is no proof of intelligence. Just proof of how good you are at IQ tests.
There is nothing to be worried about. Cryptocurrency is a new field of study and is defiantly not mainstream yet. There is no reason to think everyone will automatically know about it or even be interested.
Give bitcoin some time. Things like this take a lot of time to become accepted by the rest of the world.
@_date: 2014-10-06 07:21:44
I know. It's astonishingly weird, but I'm not gonna just sit here while someone is giving away BTC at that price.

Yeah! Just like we don't type in actual IP addresses to connect to a website, we wont use btc addresses in the future. It would be more like an domain name system perhaps?

This happened to me too. For the first half of the year I talked about bitcoin a lot. Now I rarely bring it up but I have been generally asked by my family many a time.

This guy fails to see that when miners leave the network it becomes more profitable to mine. The number of miners bitcoin needs to function is incredibly small. Even if just 100 people were mining, we would still have a network and ecosystem. 
Also if we take the block reward as is, 25 btc, we can see that if we had 100 miners on the network all mining with the same equipment, those miners would earn on average 36 btc every day! At current market value this would equivilant to $8000 a day. 
The bitcoin network will not fail. It will always be profitable to mine. END OF ARGUMENT

This is only true in the long term. Short term, we can expect a gradual rise in price up until the halving, then a quick dump soon after.

This isn't a get rich quick scheme. You might as well just gamble if you're looking for a quick buck. 
Then again, bitcoin still seems like a pretty solid long term investment. The value is likely to fall below $500 again eventually, so you should probably wait for that.

Bitcoin is not a good investment. It's too unpredictable. Yes you could make a lot of money, but you can make a lot of money on roulette too. Doesn't mean you should do it.
Treat bitcoin as what it is. An online currency, made to be spent and used. Not as a store of value.
@_date: 2015-11-04 00:57:57
Just so you know... The reason for this is due to the huge backlog of transactions atm. The Bitcoin network is only running at 1 transaction per second right now. Painfully slow. 
This may be remedied in the future if the community decides to increase the blocksize. (Currently at 1mb per block).
This is normal and very frustrating.
