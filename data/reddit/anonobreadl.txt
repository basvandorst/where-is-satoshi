And to continue the water rights analogy, I'd imagine the people of Earth would be visciously upset at the news that they can't get access to clean water, that clean water is only reserved for "rich people in Western countries" would upset them greatly.
I'd imagine they'd chant, **clean water is a natural born right**. Unfortunately if the planet becomes so overpopulated, these people will either have to die or move to another planet to obtain clean water. We're not going to dilute water with Mountain Dew, ruining it for the entire world even if it saves the lives of BILLIONS.

You people are disparaging LN, disparaging all the real scalability solutions, cursing Greg Maxwell under your breath. But now that you see the opportunity to pressure him to bump to 2, oh now you're ok with LN, now you see the light? PUKE

Then adoption is the ends that justifies the means, no matter what those means are, right?
For example, PayPal has tons of adoption now that they sacrificed their original e-cash vision. But the ends justifies the means?
If you're going to say the ends justify the means, well, a rise in fees in a true fee market unmistakeably represents rising demand for full blockchain writes. And with even *higher* certainty to boot. This is because the rising tides of the fee market definitively prove people at large are willing to pay an actual price to use Bitcoin rather than just unloyal freeloaders toiling pennies. In addition, we'd be setting the right expectations - it's not as if we can accommodate wave after wave after WAVE of new demand simply by raising the block size endlessly.

Any and all cryptocurrency technologies can be ported to sidechains. That's the whole point of sidechains.
However, sidechains are designed to accomodate BTC HODLers, by essentially stealing tech off altcoins. Most altcoins are worthless but some have salvageable innovations that can become a part of a given sidechain.
If you intuit this is impetus for a certain loudmouthed minority to hate on Blockstream and Greg Maxwell, you deserve a cookie. Sidechains are the worst possible technological innovation for altcoin holders, because once any tech is accessible from BTC, it becomes abundantly clear network effect is **everything** there is to know about cryptocurrency. If you're not on the most widely adopted and valuable coin, you're just lighting money on fire.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:35:51


As do I, but I have absolutely no doubt Lightning can achieve the peer-to-peer payments part. It's the cold storage part I'm most concerned about. We don't want the very foundation of Bitcoin to be dependent upon the good will of Corporations and datacenters.


Thanks! But actually, many are beginning to max out datacaps running nodes. And processing the blockchain on old equipment is practically out of the question unless you're willing to run it as a dedicated server in your home, which is to say nothing of the bandwidth requirements.
We're just now reaching the point where the engineers most in touch with the true costs of running nodes - the core team - are waking up and smelling the roses. We see where this is headed, and it isn't very pleasant!
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:05:32
The vast, vast majority of my coins are in cold storage on the Bitcoin blockchain - it's like a savings account to me. Why would I change my views on this in the future?
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:43:40


Right, and the steps being taken by the Core team are what's necessary for *a few* to run full nodes at higher block sizes at home.


Control the hardware and you own the software running on that hardware. The government can always tell the owner of the datacenter that running "unsanctioned software" on his hardware is against the law. Nodes need to be in *homes*, not datacenters.


Do you suggest I can handle 8GB blocks today on my home desktop? First no, you can't even handle that with industrial network connections and $10,000 enterprise grade hardware. And second, it's about the network of people who can afford to do this; if a handful of people do it, that's more centralized than PayPal! Besides, the latency of blocks that large would wreak havoc on the network according to BIP101 supporter jtoomin's own numbers.
@_date: 2015-12-30 14:50:06


Like who? I'm sorry, but Paxful has absolutely zero credibility in making this outlandish claim.


You could say the same at 1GB block size! Guess what - we can't raise and re-raise the block size ad infinitum! When will you people realize that this isn't a workable solution - for ANY cryptocurrency?!


Thanks for the helpful reminder. I'll be sure to reserve a Lightning account just for you. Feel better?


No, not without taking a leap of faith on a completely unsecure blockchain. Paxful may want to do this, no doubt because they're invested in those altcoins. Good luck with that.


Well, why couldn't your users who are "often sending you a dollar", do that over Lightning? Is that not the epitome of a payment channel?


You've made it serious. JFC. God, it's utterly sickening to see CEOs with agendas fighting tooth and nail with the very people who are making their businesses possible, and who understand better than they do how to do that in the future.

Such as?


Access to cold storage is a basic right of all Bitcoin users. Fully agreed! However, Lightning authors estimate if just half of all coffee purchases and low value payments happen over Lightning, we can support 70,000,000 users at 8MB blocks. That's if just 50% of low value payments happen over LN. And this includes giving everyone the ability to transfer BTC in and out of cold storage, making high value payments over the blockchain, etc.


Bitcoin is about providing the world with a fixed supply censorship resistant global monetary base, and we must have Layer-2 protocols offloading low value payment processing to accomplish this.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:29:08
For a hundred million people to access cold storage, the limit needs to be raised, period. But we can't offer to raise the limit as a general solution, which is what the mob wants.
If we cave now, CEOs like this are going to get the wrong impression. If you - like Paxful - are going to threaten with "altcoin this" and "crisis that" every time we bump up against the limit, then just leave. Seriously, this guy just wants to get rich off his altcoin investments, so let's just let him do that.
Forget what the mob wants. We have a roadmap already that makes sense, if you'd just have patience.

Without Hashcash, Bitcoin wouldn't exist. Not only is Adam cited in the whitepaper, and not only is his work utterly foundational to how Bitcoin works, but he designed the infamous [RSA munitions t-shirt]( in the 90s to protest the American government's actions on prohibiting exports of cryptographic software.

1. Some non-trivial % of Bitcoin HODLers completely and vehemently disagree with so called "small blockers" vision of Bitcoin
2. Equally, some non-trivial % of Bitcoin HODLers completely and vehemently disagree with so called "big blockers" vision of Bitcoin
This is the very definition of contention!
Now, pretend it's 100 years from today, in the year 2116, there are 7,000,000,000 using Bitcoin. How much BTC does the average Westerner own? 0.005 to 0.01 probably? Now let's have another "contentious debate" shall we?
I'd guess quite a few people reading this own more than 1 BTC.
Now, in the year 2116, we have some kind of global crisis with mining, and some charismatic leader begins "freely discussing" - or propagandizing depending on which side of the "debate" you're on - the idea that we should increase mining incentives by heavily taxing aged coin transfers, or even increasing the 21,000,000 coin limit to support some fancy but "generally well-liked" socialist government program of wealth redistribution to the poor.
Welcome to being the minority interest group! Now, imagine there's clear precedent for this type of decision making. As the proud owner of 1+ BTC, you don't want to get taxed, or debased - yet this is what the MAJORITY OF USERS claim to "want".
What are you going to do, claim it's a contentious hard fork?!
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:03:44


Wow. I mean, as much as I'm sure you'd be satisfied at 2MB... oh wait, you won't be. You people apparently still don't understand that we can't scale Bitcoin by raising and re-raising the block size limit ad infinitum. This isn't the *debt ceiling*. Please just sell all your bitcoins and never return. We aren't going to turn this into PayPal even if it's what 90% of people claim to "want" in the heat of the moment. JUST LEAVE.
@_date: 2015-12-28 04:27:29
Some nutters, you say? That sounds familiar. Kind of like how certain small blockers want to negatively label all big blockers as "conspiracy theorists". It isn't working.
The evidence clearly suggests this tactic of negatively disparaging a majority interest group won't be very effective at all. It isn't today, and it will be even LESS effective when you're up against 6,000,000,000 people who are poor, ignorant, have little to no stake in BTC and who have little to no understanding of how money functions.

Keyword *individuals*. And *individuals* have limited budgets, limited bandwidth and limited patience.
Bottom line, most people will never *ever* run a full node if they can't run it on a home desktop. Make them colocate a node in a remote datacenter, and even if they actually lay out the cash to do it, you've defeated the stated purpose of the node.


Most people are all talk. Ask them to put their own money on the line, and they'll disappear real quick.

Wouldn't doing their txs over Lightning be easier and carry significantly less currency risk?
And I notice you failed to be specific about which altcoin overtakes Bitcoin.

A blockchain isn't the same as a Fortune 500 Corporation. The blockchain is *much* more similar to a public good like clean water. You can dilute the water with Mountain Dew to give "water" to more people - but that ultimately doesn't give people actual clean water!


The blocksize limit isn't the same as a debt ceiling. We can't scale Bitcoin by simply raising and re-raising the block size limit ad infinitum. I'd rather 90% of Bitcoin holders sell out now than sell out the blockchain, dooming us all to a PayPal like future.

If you assert blocks *can* be 8GB, you commit to supporting blocks of size 8GB. Where is your testing?


I agree technology is progressing, but that's even more reason not to be concerned with LN and fees rising. If fees actually do become prohibitive, we can reassess the decentralization conditions and possibly raise the block size.


My point is, we don't have an infinite water supply. We may have an infinite supply of Mountain Dew mixed with water, but that's not the same thing.

@_date: 2015-12-29 19:49:42
$20 fees are over 200X the price of the fees paid by users today, under 1MB blocks and under a *voodoo* fee market that is frequently determined by service providers updating a config setting. If we'd had a real fee market based on actual bidding for the last 5 years I guarantee you the equilibrium would be lower.
With this in mind, real tx fee rates would have to rise anywhere between 200-2000X to get to $20 **at 1MB blocks**. This would require anywhere between 20,000,000 and 2,000,000,000 new users.
TLDR; it's incredibly unlikely to happen, and as one of the original guys to tell people $20 isn't the end of the world, it's a real shame to see it cited wildly out of context

If each of those limits were maxed out starting today and continuing for two years, I'd expect to see over half of all nodes gone with 4MB blocks, and over 90% gone with 8MB blocks. We'd be under 2000 nodes for sure at 8MB blocks, and for what? A meager 50 tps? Wow, this changes everything!

That's uplifting news.


But really, do you honestly think $5 tx fees "price out" ordinary people from the blockchain? Is there anyone who invests less than $50 into Bitcoin at one time who simply can't bear to leave it in Coinbase or on a voting pool or on a sidechain until they can afford the fee to withdraw to cold storage? $5 is a taco - a taco isn't a force of oppression!

Would you prefer PayPal over the privacy maximizing, inflation-proof, civil asset forfeiture proof Lightning system for low value payment processing? I'm talking a $300-$3000 balance over LN - you'll always be able to make major purchases affordably over the blockchain if you want to.
Coinbase is a bank. Layer-2 doesn't mean Bitcoin banks. It means Lightning and other P2P payment networks built on top of Bitcoin that retain the key property of blockchain payments: you never trust your money to a third party to use it.


Bottom line, a global currency is accepted in more regions than a sub-regional fiat currency. Bitcoin &gt; fiat.


As long as it buys you the product you need, who cares what the BTC price is "tethered to"?


Not really. I'd rather have BTC in cold storage than on Layer-2 unless fees rise high enough to make it not worth my while to withdraw from Layer-2.

You can say the same about water rights. The fact is, there's a limited amount of water and if we overpopulate the planet, it's fully conceivable that only "the rich in a few western countries" can drink pure undiluted water. It is ACTUALLY possible for the impoverished to die of thirst and starvation and there's not a goddamn thing we can do about that short of colonizing other worlds.
For example, you wouldn't dilute water with Mountain Dew just so that more people could drink "water". If you're not able to give them actual water due to physical limits, there's nothing that can be done, I feel bad about it but it's the damn truth.
The exact same applies to Bitcoin. If miraculously, 7,000,000,000 people wanted to adopt Bitcoin tomorrow, they're not all going to get access to the blockchain because the technology simply can't support those levels of adoption without ruining Bitcoin for the entire planet.

If you had to choose between a network that leaned heavily on Layer-2, with $20 tx fees on Layer-1; and a network fully dependent on 5 full nodes on a BIS server rack in Switzerland, what would you choose?

If you don't believe this you're no friend to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:42:17


It's an equilibrium. If blockchain tx fees rise prohibitively high, Layer-2 protocols will see a big increase in demand, effectively the market will over-correct. The over-correction will at no point cause 100% of all blockchain txs to use LN while 0% of txs use the blockchain. If nobody wants to use the blockchain, blockchain tx fees are by definition zero.

Fiat currencies are:
- inflationary

- limited to a geographic sub-region
In addition, fiat currencies have terribly poor privacy protections. The banking system has onerous KYC/AML regs, and bank transactions are tracked end-to-end by the surveillance state, the tax collector, and the banks.


If demand for blockchain space is high, fees will rise, incentivizing users to try Layer-2 solutions. Hence, fees on Layer-1 will have to be *very healthy* before Layer-2 experiences a big push in demand.

Incorrect. You can open a channel - worth 1 BTC - with Starbucks by paying them 1 BTC of your own, and getting back 0.99 BTC. Starbucks doesn't need to match with 1 BTC of their own. 0.01 BTC goes to Starbucks for your coffee, and 0.99 BTC goes back to you. You then keep updating the channel, using Starbucks' many connections to local and international individuals and merchants.
Once you open your LN accont, you can receive 1000 BTC from a random stranger over LN without ever owning 1000 BTC yourself.


This is perhaps one thing you're right about, AFAIK, the primary incentive for hubs to restart channels is to derisk themselves. But again the idea is to *avoid* hubs if at all possible.


It's not like the hubs control any of your bitcoins. Sure, the hub can troll your channels by opening and closing them. Oh noes! God forbid you give the hub a negative rating to prevent others from going through the same thing.


No, they have none of your bitcoins under their control, and they can't steal anything from you. But they *can* tarnish their reputation. To the contrary, it seems professional hubs have a lot to lose, for not much gain. They'd gain far more profits by maintaining a flawless reputation.

If you're imagining Bitcoin disrupts fiat currency on a global scale, 7,000,000,000 is no straw man - it's the *reality*.
I've asked the opposition countless times: if 7,000,000,000 adopt Bitcoin in the near future - which is the express goal of all Bitcoin holders - what do you do? Do you point them all to Coinbase? Do you say, to hell with it, we'll "trust" the BIS to run the blockchain on their server rack in Switzerland?
After a critical mass dumps fiat to hold BTC as a store of wealth, a tipping point is reached whereafter a complete exodus from fiat occurs. This could happen *very* quickly, and in fact this is the express goal of Bitcoin! Of course, you're more likely to conveniently forget this reality exists when it doesn't suit your agenda. Hell, I remember when big blockers were saying the price wouldn't rise over $300 until a major block size increase was on the books. Wow, such logic.
Bottom line, we can - maybe - safely dump the txs of 7B users directly onto the blockchain in 50 years, but that's a long time from now. And not everyone wants to be using Coinbase until then.
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:28:50


By definition, due to the 21,000,000 coin limit it's impossible for 7B people to move 0.5 BTC at the same time. There simply aren't enough BTC in circulation to allow for this to happen.


Lightning channels can remain open *indefinitely*, year after year.
In addition, if many individuals and merchants are connected on Lightning, there isn't a strong reason to withdraw miniscule amounts of BTC day after day. It would be like if everyone uses Venmo, why withdraw and deposit daily to your Venmo account? Why not just keep $300 on Venmo? Even if something goes horribly wrong, is $300 really breaking the bank for you?
And the authors of LN estimate 70,000,000 people can use BTC, including restarting channels, and making high value blockchain txs at a block size of 8MB. That's if 50% of coffee payments and low value payments occur on LN. If you believe this estimate, then we can fit 7B people in 800MB blocks. That amounts to a *huge* reduction in resources necessary to run full nodes, and it could very well be the difference between Bitcoin running in datacenters only, and Bitcoin running on ordinary home PCs.


For low value daily payments and microtxs, $0-$3000 in value, I'm really not all that concerned about hubs - even if they do arise it's not the end of the world. Severe bugs notwithstanding, you get a full refund if anything goes wrong and you never have to trust anyone with your bitcoins.


Lightning alone isn't enough. You need LN in concert with block size increases in addition to voting pools and sidechains - all will be necessary.

Few Americans, you mean? Does an Argentine need to "grok" the whitepaper to know they'll lose their life savings if drastic measures aren't taken? I would certainly think the cost of a taco isn't enough to deter the people who need Bitcoin the most, from storing wealth securely in BTC.

OK, but since there are only 21M BTC, clearly 7,000,0000,000 people can't each have 0.5 BTC simultaneously. That would be breaking the 21M coin limit.
And 7B isn't an "arbitrary number", it's meant to be representative of the global population. If you believe the estimates of the LN authors, 7B can use Bitcoin with 800MB blocks - and that's if just 50% of coffee payments and other low value payment processing happens on LN.


No, that simply isn't the case. For example, if Alice and Bob each visit Whole Foods **once**, and then Alice visits a movie theatre, Bob automatically gains access to the movie theatre too.
What does "gains access to" mean? It means Bob can say, when we settle give me -0.001 BTC, and instead update the movie theatre's BTC balance to +0.001. None of that has to hit the blockchain.
You don't have to close down the channel after each payment. The internet of hubs keeps going, and you can keep channels open indefinitely, year after year.


OK, the idea isn't to rely on hubs - see Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon - but let's say we do have professional LN hubs. Why do professional LN hubs want to "play foul", exactly? Hubs never control any money and can't steal your BTC, but they *can* tarnish their own reputation by not living up to their end of the bargain by causing your channel to hit the chain.

You could say the same for email, TCP/IP and Ebay.
No, you don't need to grok a technical whitepaper before adopting the underlying technology. That simply isn't a factor, as proven by the history of internet adoption.
Honestly, there must have been some miscommunication here. From my point of view, you claimed water is "priced in" - whatever that means - but Bitcoin isn't priced in. What does that even mean?

Here's why BTC tokens aren't nearly the same thing as VISA fiat tokens:
1. BTC txs are uncensorable, VISA txs are censorable
2. BTC balances are unseizable, VISA balances are seizable
3. BTC monetary base is disinflationary, VISA fiat monetary base is inflationary
4. BTC works in all countries, VISA fiat is sub-regional
5. BTC is a P2P open source network, VISA is a megacorp
6. BTC inert cold storage is in your sole control, VISA balance is in their sole control
People who think BTC is the same thing as VISA, are like people who can't see the difference between physical bullion and E-Gold. The former is a commodity, the latter is a company. Understand?
Obviously we have Bitcoin payment companies like Coinbase, Xapo and Circle - just like we have physical bullion payment companies like Egold but Bitcoin being programmable money we get an interesting shade of gray between BTC inert cold storage and blockchain txs, and Egold models.
Now, compare BTC tokens to Lightning BTC tokens:
1. BTC txs are uncensorable, LN txs are censorable by hubs with the caveat that there can be lots of hubs and that anyone can be a hub, even on Tor
2. BTC balances are unseizable, *LN balances are unseizable*
3. BTC monetary base is disinflationary, *LN monetary base is disinflationary* - they're one and the same
4. BTC works in all countries, *LN works in all countries*
5. BTC is a P2P open source network, *so is LN*
6. BTC inert cold storage is in your sole control, LN balances are yours virtually guaranteed - under adversarial conditions after a timelock, complete financial loss possible due to bugs but this is designed for low balances $0-$3000

Sure, but the [average lifespan of a world reserve currency]( is about 100 years. It's anyone's guess when the next tipping point is reached, but once it *is* reached, either you're holding good money or you're holding bad, worthless money. Once [hyperbitcoinization]( begins, it'll motivate all levels of society - from the top echelons of government down to the world's most impoverished - to dump fiat for BTC.

- Fact: Bitcoin succeeds beyond your wildest dreams if 7,000,000,000 adopt it
- Fact: 7,000,000,000 users won't all fit on the blockchain for *multiple decades*
- Fact: Nevertheless, you would be supportive of a future in which 7,000,000,000 users adopt Bitcoin
It's high time the opposition admits 7,000,000,000 Bitcoin users on sidechains, voting pools and Lightning is an unmistakeably tremendous victory for Bitcoin.

Is Bitcoin a *failure* if 7,000,000,000 people adopt it tomorrow? Please tell me you understand that 7,000,000,000 adopters can't all use the blockchain if this occurs, since dumping trillions of txs on the chain today simply can't be done without putting Bitcoin's blockchain on a handful of server racks and processing it with supercomputers owned by heavily regulated megacorps.
That ISN'T Bitcoin. That's an expensive version of PayPal. It's a major central point of failure when the entities in charge of the entire Bitcoin system are huge, centrally located and as a result of being so globally important - *heavily regulated*.
Ironically, BitPayStephen has previously argued blockchain tx fees can't rise so high that only a few megabanks can afford using it for settlement, because logically at that point the megabanks can turn to each other and decide to use a permissioned ledger instead.
Pray tell - BitPayStephen - what's the difference between a blockchain running on a BIS supercomputer, managed by no more than a handful of megacorps, and a **permissioned ledger**?

That's a very self-contradictory statement, don't you think? In addition, it's evidently false given that you just previously asserted quote:


And no, it's not - even in the worst case for the world's most impoverished it's *not*. Did you miss that I said the world's most impoverished can float a balance for a week or month at a time on Layer-2 solutions before withdrawing to cold storage?

RBF is closely intertwined with Lightning. The whole point of Lightning is to deprecate blockchain txs for retail face-to-face payment processing.


Try reading the guy's post? Here, let me quote it for you:




These are his direct words. And going by the adoption levels of the legacy banking system, it's just *staggeringly* false.

What if I don't mind if my tx confirms in more than 48 hours?
Why should I have to drop my tx in that timeframe? Doesn't this mean low-fee paying users need to cling to their computer monitor to make sure the tx goes through within 2 days?
Wouldn't this result in a usability nightmare for users with a low-fee, slow confirm time preference?
@_date: 2016-01-04 02:24:46
I don't think that means what you think it means. First, forecasting higher valuations of the underlying suggests an increasing willingness to do blockchain txs, including at $5+ fees. Second, it suggests the population at large is highly undereducated, hence whatever grassroots support exists for the misconception that BTC = VISA, is highly likely to be crushed by user education over the coming years. Educated users won't think twice about using Layer-2 solutions to do fast and cheap sub-$100 txs.
@_date: 2016-01-05 21:48:54
And it's not as if miners can steal your coins from your cold storage wallet. Even in the event of a 51% attack the worst they can do is defraud merchants, temporarily disrupt your daily blockchain txs, and possibly cause the market price of BTC to crash. That's a far cry from "miners controlling Bitcoin".
@_date: 2016-01-04 00:29:59
And what's preventing the impoverished from floating a daily wage on a sidechain or Lightning account until the end of the week or month, at which point they can trivially withdraw to cold storage for long term wealth savings?

I agree, the communications strategy - Bitcoin.org being the prime example - has resulted in this whole debate languishing. Please understand it isn't in anyone's interests to add insult to injury.
Let's take this one at a time.


How simple is the USD? Entire teams led by names such as James Corbett and Mike Maloney have had to produce feature length documentaries just to communicate to ordinary people how the legacy banking system works. Hence, please answer these two questions as honestly as you can:
1. Do you suggest the legacy banking system *isn't* complicated?
2. Regardless of your answer to 1, do you suggest Bitcoin even with Lightning and sidechains is *more* complicated than the legacy banking system?
Guys it's real simple - like gold, most BTC sits in secure vaults, unmoving. What is so hard to understand about this?


I'm genuinely not sure what you mean by this. Can you elaborate?
For example, I can pass off a check to a local small business that is entirely fraudulent. I can walk away never to return, and I may even realistically face few if any consequences if I skip town or leave the country. This is actually quite comparable to defrauding a merchant with RBF. Both are equally illegal and dumb to do if you care about your freedom and your relationship with the merchant.


If, miraculously, 7,000,000,000 people adopt Bitcoin tomorrow, they're not all going to fit on the chain - and we won't be able to cope simply by allocating "extra disk space and bandwidth". These are physically limited resources you're talking about, but you speak of them as if they're unlimited and cost free. *They're not*. I also get the impression from your posts that you believe the core devs somehow don't own more BTC than you. *They do*. Core devs are NOT about to kill the golden goose. Please.


If I didn't know this was just you venting your frustrations, I'd tell you the solution is for you to sell all your coins. *Scram*.


Hard to understand? Sounds like a consumer education problem.


It is already "the fucking problem", guy.


Sure, by putting all Bitcoin nodes on a server rack in Basel, and processing the blockchain with a supercomputer owned by a handful of megacorps, you too can reinvent PayPal. Where in the whitepaper did Satoshi call Bitcoin "A Datacenter-to-Datacenter Cool Things Network"?


And the daily award for the best use of the *Royal We* goes to....

Bitcoin is an investment and store of wealth first. It's a payment mechanism second.
[Wences Casares proposes Bitcoin will be adopted as a store of wealth before it becomes a widespread payment mechanism](
Notice how the primary benefit of Bitcoin to you is the investment performance? How many tps did that require? Basically zero, right? It's the same as with gold, or any other investment.
Investment and store of value come before all else, because nobody wants to lose money on their investment, losing money on your investment that happens to be a great payment mechanism just ensures that nobody actually holds on to the investment, decreasing its utility, harming its network effect, and hence ruining its viability as a payment mechanism.

Heard of **PRISM**? Funny thing - it turns out, the US government can trivially coerce the largest US tech companies to take actions *directly against* their users' wishes. This would include spying on them and hijacking their data without their consent.
Imagine what utter havoc would be wreaked on the Bitcoin system if the US government got their wish, and we had no more than a few dozen Corporations running all the nodes? Would Bitcoin continue to be permissionless through the years? Would development be any *less* centralized? The answer to these questions is an emphatic NO.
By advocating a future where we have 35 some odd nodes for the entire world, presumably owned by no more than 35 megacorps, you're advocating to put Bitcoin's backbone precariously under the thumb of the government.


And who owns that node? For crying out loud, if we only had one node, we only have ONE Corporation in a datacenter determining what is and what isn't the longest valid chain. WTF kind of network is that?


What are you talking about? Have you *never before* wanted to check your BTC balances in perfect privacy? Have you *never before* wanted to accept payments in perfect privacy?
Guess what - you need a full node to accomplish these things. You can't manage it over Tor - you need to do it by making zero remote network connections for perfect privacy.




BitpayStephen, how incredibly disingenous of you. As you surely know, most BTC-accepting merchants *already* do the lazy thing, and just contract that function out to BitPay or Coinbase.
By preventing us - the people of Bitcoin - from operating full nodes of our own, you eliminate our ability to do this independent from a Corporation like your own. For example, if it takes 6 weeks and $10,000 to spin up a new node, 99.99999% of merchants are going to take the lazy route of trusting Bitpay or Coinbase with that function.
What does this do to privacy? Autonomy? How does this affect which products people are comfortable *buying* with BTC? Do you want Bitpay or Coinbase to figure out what you're spending all of your BTC on?
Regardless, this vision advocated by you BitpayStephen is certainly good for Bitpay's revenue! Thanks!

Thanks for the translation. I know this isn't your article. Just wanted to analyze this part:






By the author's definition, micro transactions are paying 4/10ths of a penny? That's a 1% fee on a $0.40 tx. It's a 10% fee on a $0.04 tx. To me, microtxs are txs valued at $0.01 or less. These txs are clearly doomed even under the author's presumably preferred gigablocks vision of Bitcoin in datacenters.
And as for small txs, the author says $0.40 fees at a BTC price of $400/coin? This is a 1% fee on $40. It's a 10% fee on $4. Again by the author's *own definition*, buying lunch with BTC may be out of your comfort zone, so I guess we're also losing small txs too under the gigablocks?
Regardless - if his pretense is that losing on-chain microtxs - which aren't actually microtxs in my book - are going to in any way harm adoption currency, I have to object on the grounds that microtxs have no real users today, and very likely will continue to have no real users for well into the forseeable future. What theoretical fee pressure is being taken away here exactly?
As for the "small txs", I just never do them in BTC. I don't think there IS a use for retail payments today outside of DNMs, and regardless there would only be major retail use after widespread adoption of BTC as a store of wealth. For instance, Purse.io as an isolated app isn't compelling enough to spur billions of people to go through the hassle of acquiring BTC just to *spend it*.
It's easy to lose sight of the importance of secure wealth storage to Bitcoin demand, which is by far the most serious use case of Bitcoin today, and one that, similar to gold, requires 0 tps outside of the exchange and liquidation process. How about we optimize Bitcoin to become a global monetary base with realistic assumptions?
@_date: 2016-01-03 23:08:30


You can "assume an exponential increase in demand" for **clean water**, too. In many ways, clean water is perfectly analogous to the blockchain:
Clean Water | Bitcoin Blockchain
---         | ---
Public resource nobody would consider doing without | Public resource no Bitcoin user would consider doing without
Physically limited by available supply | Physically limited by available technology
Perceived as cheap and plentiful | Perceived as cheap and plentiful
Perceptions diverge from reality under extreme population growth | Perceptions diverge from reality under extreme adoption scenarios
For example, if 7,000,000,000 people adopt Bitcoin tomorrow, they're not going to all fit on the blockchain unless you're prepared to put the blockchain on a BIS server rack in Basel and process it with supercomputers controlled by heavily regulated megacorps.
This is akin to, if the Earth is extremely overpopulated, mixing Mountain Dew with water under the misguided pretense that this will satiate the thirst of the world's poor.
Nobody is actually using Bitcoin, if they're using a Bitcoin blockchain controlled by the BIS, just like the world's poor won't actually be drinking clean water, if it's water mixed with Mountain Dew.


If you truly believe your own words, you'd have to agree Bitcoin will succeed at fee levels in excess of $5, which is comparable to the price of a *taco*. A *taco* isn't a force of oppression.
