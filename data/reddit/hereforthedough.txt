Not stupid ones.
Here's some more reading that you apparently missed at White Trash U.

Doubt it. In my experience that simply isn't how life works. Sure, you need decent exposure to math in some degree or another. But, just like my brother taught himself to code and I dropped out of high school to write, you will naturally gravitate towards things that interest you. Nobody has to push math geniuses into studying math because they *want* to. Any person walking the Earth in a Western country is exactly as educated (maybe not with degrees to show it) as they choose to be. If you think someone would have had to make you like math you really just never would like it.

Congrats, nothing you said is related to anything I said and nobody cares. I'm glad you think that people should be able to lie in public without consequence, but I reject you opinion and opinion-forming potential as a result. Later.

Yeah sure, and Trump's an author.

I played on Chesapeake until maybe 6 months after they released the expansion that created new landmass (after Felluca/Trammel). The game turned into P2W garbage at that point and I quit. A year or two later I started on Angel Island which I played for 5 or so years. Played on Project X and Hybrid some too. Towards the end I was so wealthy and bored that I pretty much did nothing but 5x dueling (which I was a GOD at). Man I miss the dueling...probably the thing in life that I was honestly best at. I certainly can't compete globally at anything else.

You are correct. My mistake. Total brainfart. I'm actually completely in agreement with you. I don't even think the teachers are important. My brother taught himself and was a far better programmer than his high school teachers could dream of being by the time he graduated with a full scholarship. Anyone teaching programming in a high school is probably abjectly pathetic in terms of ability, or the most altruistic person alive.

I have never bought an EA game since Ultima Online. Its been like a decade. Just looked up Lords of Ultima and it has a remake/sequel apparently.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:07:28
I linked to something citing objective information proving my point. I'll reply when you do the same. Otherwise you'll have to go buy more friends to talk to.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:16:08


Everyone's a 'prodigy or genius' if they have a good teacher? What are you smoking?
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:15:17


What? lol
Maybe somewhat talented and studious. Definitely not 'genius'.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:18:31
My younger brother coded his own non-graphical client for Ultima Online when he was about 15. He used it with web servers to create an army of "players" who were all programmed to follow his character like a trained army. They could heal and cure each other (and him), and they could all drop a damaging spell at the same .1 second as him (instantly and unpreventably killing any other player).
Creating a cell phone app that pulls and displays data doesn't seem to measure up.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:14:54
Oh sweet irony. I've now given you two objective sources and you keep talking like a small child. This isn't about me, its about fraternities and you are proving my points by acting like a petulant child who has no actual source of information to support his gullible and naive beliefs.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:39:11
Nah, there are books and studies on the subject. They are literally evolved from secret societies of rich kids who were conspiring to get away with unethical and illegal behavior.
Wouldn't expect a frat kid to know shit though. From experience. I wrote all their papers...
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:02:48


I would argue you are not very literate, since I made no claims about how dues were spent. Another point against frat kids.


Nobody cares, and nobody asked.


Weird that you were capable since you can't read and comprehend things now. Good luck with your fraternity-powered career doing shit standup, or even worse, promoting it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:04:17


You say that, but I've been waiting a long time and their stock only goes up.
There are way too many stupid people for EA to ever go away. As long as the millions upon millions of dumbfucks give a shit that their sports character in a video game has the same name as a player in real life they will continue to grow and get richer and richer.
I'm praying for their customer base to die off, because that is more plausible.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:02:15


No, you have paid membership to a networking club full of wealthy kids. Friends don't charge.


Paper sure. The frat kid is a dumb fucking moron compared to the student who studied though, especially in that example. Same paper, very different brains and skillsets.


Yeah sure, or drink yourself to death, let guys shove stuff up yourass, or gangrape some chicks. Depends on the frat.


Still proving my point. You joined a jerkoff rich kid club instead of developing skills or education and are rewarded for it. Society is garbage and rich people are fucking conartists is my point.


Yup. And none of them are there because of merit but because of corruption and bribery. Fuck them all.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:04:58
I was welcome to attempt to buy friends like everyone else.
My school did not have fraternities though.
You realize by making retarded little kid insults instead of actually citing information that you are proving my point, right? You probably don't, which just proves it even further.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:12:42
Not responding to anything but a citation, you awesome student you.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:52:35


Not sure if anything changed, but I recall that fraternity membership was a better predictor of future income than anything related to grades or degree.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:08:12
I linked to something citing objective information proving my point. I'll reply when you do the same. Otherwise you'll have to go buy more friends to talk to.
A college student knows that your retarded notion of 'firsthand' sources are called 'anecdotal'. lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:38:20


Had the Internet at 16. Thanks for the enlightenment, grandfather. You must be old as shit because I'm 32 and was on BBS systems when I was about 8 on a 386 IBM.


Don't lump me in with you. I was actually writing code at 16. It was C++ and Java in AP Computer Science and I realized I wasn't great at it and moved on. I didn't seize upon being a minority and pretend that I had accomplished something in public for money. Sorry, that's pathetic and you should have to live it down for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:23:06
I'm not seeing any evidence for anything. I see her and her mother making claims. I see MIT getting good publicity. I don't see any evidence of actual success or programming ability.
The news that she has said things and is going to MIT is real. The news that she's a prodigy or anything else is purely speculation.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:32:27


You said a 16 year-old who could make a cell phone app was. Then you said everyone could if they had a good teacher.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:15:05
My point is frat kids are stupid as fuck and here you are. I've cited multiple sources of information and you think calling me names is relevant. I'd beat the shit out of you if you charged me for a paper using your writing and reasoning skills. Did you ever write a paper that got a passing grade? Because making dumb shit up and calling people names doesn't fly at real schools.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:12:14


Maybe. You don't actually know that and nobody ever will
You are looking at your lack of interest as a child through lenses tinted from your adult perspective and regret.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:13:07
Well, you just proved it. Good luck with the standup career.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:22:05


Yeah, its self-loathing to some degree. I have so much more than I deserve or ever earned and so did/does every relative I've ever met. It is unfair that I can sit here doing drugs and jerking off and get more money an hour than most of the restaurant servers will earn today.
I'm not really bitter, just constantly conscious of how stupid our society is set up. What I'm always blown away by is the fact that everyone else isn't bitter. I'm only kind of a product of inherited wealth...true billionaires infuriate me.
Also, this account was made to participate in Garliccoin mining, hence the name. My other one got banned in the meantime for telling a copsucking mod what I thought about him and the value of his existence.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:47:20
That was the only Ultima game I ever played or got into. I was hardcore addicted to it for like 8 years. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:07:30
I linked to something citing objective information proving my point. I'll reply when you do the same. Otherwise you'll have to go buy more friends to talk to. You realize I can see you are a chubby neckbeard right? Your fake ass white trash frat is unrelated to the conversation.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:05:55
Got a citation? Because I've got more. I started with one, so once you respond to it with actual information I'll continue.
Until you do that I'm going to continue to mock your lack of education and inability to argue like a college freshman.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:28:53
Jesus you people are obnoxious.
It has nothing to do with gender and everything to do with the fact that SHE WAS THE ONE WHO CAME AND LIED TO OUR FACES. Yeah, sure corporate entities are shit and they act like shit. No surprise there. So, of course, I blame the piece of shit individual with a face who directly performed the offending action.
