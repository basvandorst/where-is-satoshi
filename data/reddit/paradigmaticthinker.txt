Does anybody on do any sort of independent thinking?  This is basically fake news.  Not the individual parts, mind you (like banks downtalking cryptos, etc.)  But this idea that crypto trading is causing any sort of meaningful problem at any well-run banks.
Then the OP goes on to produce what is essentially a crypto plug piece.

I think the long term success of bitcoin as a medium of exchange has been settled (not a good one).  That's why you've seen the big switch to "bitcoin as a store of value."
So your next question is:  Do you have *faith* in this?  Well, that's highly subjective.
In the meantime, there's a lot of "trapped money" out there.  Trapped money is what happens when the price falls below a lot of people's cost basis.  Trapped money is nervous money.  It's scared money.  It will stay put if there's a belief that they'll become un-trapped.  But leave them trapped long enough, and they'll sell.  
And create more trapped money.
And so on.

Sorry, nothing more than what you’d see out of any other adherent to the Chicago school of thought. Essentially, libertarianism and the love of gold (and gold-like things). 
You’ll get lots of upvotes here because if there’s ignorance, it’s most evident in the paucity of knowledge of finance and banking you see in the Bitcoin crowd (assuming they aren’t here simply to gamble).

My rent and cost of food. But how about rent and the cost of food for those who make the food?  In other words, why is my food and rent cost declining?  Because somebody else is already suffering from the deflationary cycle. 
My friend you come up with your best arguments. Don’t worry about what I have in store for you.
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:33:00
Yep. All part of the deflationary cycle. But not in a consistent or uniform fashion. So your wages may decline before your rent or cost of food does. 
But yay forced libertarianism for all and who doesn’t love the idea of resurrecting the gold standard as something shiny, new and (best of all) digital?

@_date: 2019-03-13 15:25:00
Doubtful. Many of them will try to ascertain why it is that inflation is desirable. Then they’ll come across the concept of deflation, and associated deflationary cycles. And they’ll come full circle as to why everybody already had this same conversation well over 100 years ago. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:16:03
They literally want a free lunch. Which is curious, as all libertarians know that there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. 
There’s no risk in holding cash. Thus, there should be no positive economic return to the behavior. In an inflationary system, this works. It encourages the movement and use of cash, rather than its hoarding. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 19:34:35
What you want is a free ride. You want a positive economic return for doing nothing (holding cash). 
In a fixed money supply regime where economic output is not fixed, the value of money will necessarily increase over time (deflation). In essence you experience the benefits of the entire output of the economy, without lifting a finger, by holding the fixed variable (cash). 
There’s no such thing as a free lunch. But that’s what you’re looking for here. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 16:21:08
After their wages are adjusted downward to keep the system in balance during deflation?  Yes - they’ll look back to the insistence by young libertarians that we all live on the new “digital gold standard” as an unalloyed good in their life.

Job displacements due to technological advancements are not part of deflationary cycles. Conceptually yes, there are similarities but they are different economic processes.
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:02:01
Your commentary suggests, theoretically, that deflationary cycles are either somehow self correcting, can’t really happen, or are possibly good things. 
None of the functional experience bears this out. Countries mired in deflationary cycles have definitely don’t want to be there, and the situation is not self correcting. 
And to be clear, we’re talking about classically defined deflationary spirals. Not to be confused with technological advancement which brings about price reductions. Two related but different phenomena.

That goes without saying. What goes unsaid is that when people organize in the absence of a state, a new state is typically the outcome.

And here's one more:  If you strip away all of the fiat conspiracy views and paranoid privacy concerns, there simply isn't a compelling reason for the vast majority of people to use bitcoin in any transaction whatsoever.  
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:58:48
There are definitely uses.  Buying drugs online.  Cyber extortion.  Sending money to your Nigerian relatives for (what used to be) pennies.  Buying things from Overstock.com.  However, those things aren't realistic for the "vast majority" of people.  
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:01:37
Bitcoin as a speculative instrument is not in dispute here.  However, the great returns bitcoin has shown recently are *another* nail in the coffin for use.  Why would you spend something you think is going to rise in price?  It's no different than the concept of deflation and the risks it poses to an economy:  People refuse to buy today what they think will be cheaper tomorrow, resulting in the so-called "deflationary spiral."

SEC does not oversee futures markets. - that's CFTC as you said. 
It also stands as an intermediary only; it does not custody anything. It stands in if one side renegs. 
It always takes two sides to create a futures contract. The exchange never creates them.

Most exchanges are regulated entities, especially in the developed world. If you trade on an exchange, that exchange generally has to report your gains.

Banking is way, way more than sallying up to an ATM.

Gold certificate and ETF are conceptually similar terms. I used the former to make it clear that I wasn’t narrowly referring to one type of security in particular. 
Anyways, dealing with transference will be the problem for the apocalypse. Perhaps they go the gold vault + gold certificate route. Maybe they go with some form of digital token backed by gold or another medium. Who knows.
The point here comes down to the old “beauty context” analogy. I don’t care who “the most beautiful girl is,” I want to know who *everybody else* thinks is the most beautiful.

The same reason owning actual gold bullion vs “gold certificates” or any security backed by gold is precisely because when it comes time to barter, you’re gonna need more than a piece of paper. 
Contrary to whatever it is that you’re the thinking, mankind will absolutely go on - even in the “apocalypse.”  You can count on people wanting to do business, and you can count on the fact that every person on this planet knows what gold is. What you can’t count on are miners maintaining the blockchain, or assuming that people will accept your bits and bytes as payment of any kind.

Insurance prevents bank closures because it provides *confidence,* which is what is necessary in a fractional reserve system.

Hence, no bank runs. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 13:38:58
Thanks for responding.
Volatility is in the eye of the beholder.  A 50% move in a security nobody owns doesn't hold a candle to a 2% move in one day in, say, something like a U.S. 10 Year note.  And yet the latter is so widely held you'd think that it's immune from price movement.
Increasing market cap is a sign of increasing ownership.  Yes, it takes more to move price on an absolute basis but when it does move, far more people are affected.
Further, size and stability breeds instability via the mechanism of leverage.  The "safest" instruments are often afforded the greatest leverage by financial institutions.  So when a "safe" asset finally makes its big move (as they always do), the pain is unbelievable.
Speculators won't be pushed away from a security with high participation...they're in fact drawn to it for a variety of reasons (leverage and liquidity being the top two).  I don't need 10% price movements in a day if I can use 100x leverage.

Taken literally, “free society” would definitely be confusing in this context.

This is all a gigantic rant into the wind. You started by “explaining” why a BTC ban won’t work. I set you straight. The libertarian white paper that has followed here is all well and good, but doesn’t address the fact that a ban isn’t quite what you “explained” it to be. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:17:24
You don’t understand how bans work. 
It isn’t about absolute prevention. Murder is illegal but there is no mechanism in place to stop you from murdering. Only consequences. 
The point of a ban is to raise the bar (via consequences ) so that it becomes unattractive for the vast majority of people who won’t consider breaking the law. They don’t care about the libertarian arguments, etc. They just know it’s illegal.
