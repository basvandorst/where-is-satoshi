That quote is out of context
"Like Argentina, number two ranked Venezuela also suffers from relatively high inflation and frequent financial crises, while number three ranked Zimbabwe has the largest informal economy (black market) of any country in the dataset at 63% of GDP.
A country which often features in discussion of bitcoin adoption but which is just outside of the top-10 is China, which is ranked number 13. China’s ranking is brought down by its relatively small black market; according to Elgin and Oztunali (2012) and other shadow economy researchers – ie Buehn and Schenider (2012), Schneider, Buehn and Montenegro (2010) – it is estimated that roughly 10% of the economic activity is conducted informally in China."

Some good stuff here from Matonis: "Aside from the fact that bitcoin survives and outlasts political institutions just like the Internet does, its greatest strength lies in the fact that it does not require government or other third parties to sanction its legitimacy. Bitcoin’s legitimacy derives from its market adoption and continued usage among its participants."

Yes, and it is also in the CoinDesk article. 
"Basu stresses, however, that bitcoin is not a deliberate Ponzi and that there is little to to gain by treating it as such. The bitcoin bubble of 2013 was the result of speculation rather than an organised scheme.
However, he says that bitcoin could have other things to teach economists and bankers:
“The main value of bitcoin may, in retrospect, turn out to be the lessons it offers to central banks on the prospects of electronic currency, and on how to enhance efficiency and cut transactions cost.”"

I think Lamassu recommend 5%, but some have a higher commission rate than that. 
"Similarly, Adam Smith, president of Bitcoin Solutions, reported the numbers were "spot on" in regards to the earnings the machines provided. However, he noted that Bitcoin Solutions charges a commission of 8% on its units.
Smith went on to suggest his volume figures were lower than the average provided by Lamassu, adding: "Our Lamassu in Edmonton has seen over $70,000 in gross volume since our launch in February.""

Contacted as it was a mis-quote. And the correction is on the piece. 
Correction (8.14am, 3rd July): A previous version of this article said that Circle would be opening to all people who had so far signed up. Circle has since clarified that they would be “accepting a significant number of invitees by August”, not “all”.
Nothing wrong with that.

OK - Anything sponsored need to be labelled as such - CD just have a lot of mud thrown at them unfairly I think. I think cryptocoinnews label sponsored posts clearly. CT have 'trusted' reviews which I don't particularly like, especially as this is open to being manipulated by scammers like bit-trader ponzi thing. Also is pretty much selling links.. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 22:13:07
But the article is clearly about the company??? I don't get the confusion. If people are confused now, why would they not be 12 months ago?

VC or companies investing money does not mean they control any of these companies. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 08:10:52
Yes, it depends on the case, so it does not mean all actually have any power to make any decisions, although they can advise and give connections, they don't want to run the company *usually*.

But each conversion you'd lose % of your salary. 
And you can't pay bills directly usually - For anyone who owns a place to live it's just a bit pointless being paid in bitcoin. Alright if you are a squatter I imagine

Anyone testing it? I can't get it to send to any address in the meta-tag
@_date: 2015-11-23 17:17:25
I think this one has a secret owner. Prob found this dude on PPH then 'promoted' him.

He would not be in that suit for long if so

@_date: 2015-03-23 16:57:32
Autotip was more a proof of concept, as it is buggy and not ready for use. I like the meta-tag idea and there's no reason that Changetip or other services could use the same thing with plugins etc. 
@_date: 2015-11-23 11:51:47
Been the case since Eric sold it
@_date: 2015-03-04 10:31:44
App installs and use?
@_date: 2015-03-24 09:10:25
Yeah, it should use the same meta-tag system. Will try the demo as autotip for me was just paying out to the same bitcoin address and not the one I had put on a site. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 09:15:04
Does not work correctly, sends to the same address and not the one in the meta tag
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:03:28
Sounds very dodgy, they seem to be spamming PR channels too
@_date: 2015-03-23 13:03:05

@_date: 2015-03-13 17:30:08
They have accepted bitcoin for a while now for other products (ads through  and  and I'm sure the store will too, in time. All the mud-slinging is just silly, and usually from people with questionable motives. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 12:14:22
Bitcoin in person is usually much slower than using a contactless card though?  Long way to go before it's anywhere near it
@_date: 2015-10-02 15:26:38
Are they really considered affiliates if it is just a 'friend' referral scheme. You even see the name of the person. Not really a professional affiliate scheme. Was anyone doing thousands of $$$ through this anyway?

Cloudflare is on the site too and probably has a login attempt block. So far other 'news' sites have had more issues to be fair with security. Blocking by IP is obviously possible, but if you have contributors worldwide probably difficult to manage at scale.

I don't think having £120 or so of bitcoin in a mobile wallet is a big deal to walk around with. Could last a while if used for small transactions. It is different to having a big wad of notes looking tempting to muggers!

This article is quite recent, and interesting - 
There may be reasons other than pleasure for e-cigs, like trying to quit. Best way for that is prob with making it as cigaraette-like as possible. But then they could go onto all sorts of un-cigarette options as you say, including ones with fancy flavourings so they get weened off the ciggy taste :)

This has been fixed :)
CoinDesk: Do you own any bitcoins yourself?
Sarah Meiklejohn (SM): We bought a bunch of bitcoins with the grant money… one of the things I bought was 10 of the physical bitcoins, Casascius Bitcoins. We have these weekly reviews so we decided to give out a bitcoin to whoever gave the best presentation.
But if you gave any presentation, that was the best one by default. So we had to stop giving out the bitcoins, because we were giving people like $80 [the exchange rate at the time] to show a graph.
I earned one of those bitcoins for my presentation. I cashed out right away… and got 80 bucks. [laughs] I guess I could have waited and done better.
When we first bought bitcoins, [the exchange rate] was like $5 a bitcoin, so we’ve done well for ourselves there. [On Nov. 8, when this conversation took place, one bitcoin was worth $288.71.]
We bought a bunch more later, probably at more like $15. The rise in the price has been pretty outrageous. We bought about 25 bitcoin [and still have many of them].

The basic idea behind the Payment Request initiative is to give Bitcoin a mechanism for sending verified payments directly between people. This doesn’t take transactions away from the blockchain, but it does provide an extra layer of security between merchant and customer. It also makes payments more user-friendly.
Good stuff. No idea why this would get voted down!

Bittylicious has a hidden market behind the scenes where different sellers compete I think. They can choose where to base their prices and probably add percentages. The price is probably just reacting slower to the rapid price fluctuations.

Why am I not seeing anything on the map?

It would be great to represent this visually as it is quite complex. I will look into that..
But this might help you -  
Apologies if it does not!
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:00:00
Yeah, if it is not over 10000% then I am not interested.

COmment back from Zerlan - 
"Zerlan also explained the lack of PayPal as a payment option for the Monarch: “We do accept Paypal, just not on the Monarch. When you start doing Paypal transactions over a certain amount, it gets more complicated, which is why we elected not to do PayPal with the Monarch at it’s nearly $5,000 price point. We still accept PayPal for all of our other products though.”"

No smoke without fire. And in this case there was a LOT of fire.

Anyone got a mirror of this?

'Exploding' not a term you want to use. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:59:20
BTC China and OKCoin would be taking the lead on this, and the smaller exchange will more likely have to follow. I think this is a false hope of that this will be allowed to continue. 
But at least it is a way for those who wish to trade to attempt it until that happens. If they do get bigger then more scrutiny will follow. 
Interesting to see this play out anyway...
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:49:25
How are you getting on with this? 
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:24:05
That looks like some dudes basement
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:34:03
This is not promotion? Hardly CoinDesk's fault that people who paid in advance for a risky preorder had to wait.

Same as those bars with steering wheels attached

Read it: It is conservative "To keep our overall calculation conservative, we will assume the transaction value of this use case to be zero."

I thought I lost a bitcoin wallet once, but I did manage to restore it after quite a few bouts of head-scratching... but then I've thought I've lost physical wallets, when in fact they were under the bed all along. Says it all really..

What is this exchanges volume? I cannot seem to find data on this. Is this possible as it is under the radar?

This is indeed posssible and Liberty games are working on this at the moment in the UK - they have made a pool table. 
And they got the idea from this project - 
A guy also did make a gas-pump proof of concept. But mobile use is banned in petrol forecourts 'round these parts!
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:15:03
Looks good, will try and get some sent to UK

All this talk of beer is making me thirsty, we need some central London pubs for us CoinDeskers to meet!
@_date: 2013-11-08 09:02:38
Yeah - that's right - 
@_date: 2013-07-23 08:15:40
Depends where you are regarding power / shipping costs I guess. Try the TGB mining calculator - 
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:26:00
Looks like a depressing place to drink. Give me a real pub any time.

The article explains why this is. It can return.

Coinfloor has secured multiple banking accounts from several different partners, he said. At least one of those is a Santander-owned bank, but neither the exchange nor the VC is saying who.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:47:41
Inclusion is based on an index criteria. Gox left off due to USD withdrawal delays. If they are resolved then I guess it will be re-included.

Does anyone actually have access to the bitcoin wikipedia page, it always seems quite out of date regarding news
@_date: 2013-10-29 10:42:11
Simpler to buy and sell? Users seems to like how it works. Not sure its the best wallet, but then most probably don't keep all their coins there. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 12:46:27
Yeah it depends on the drink really and where you are. 
Some place once tried to charge £5 for a can of red stripe. It was a silent disco so could hear my expletive quite loudly.

How so? You complain about belittling a country, then come out with that garbage. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:51:53
It looks good to the feds to combine resources against kiddie fiddlers. Plus it is the right thing to do. I guess they can present bitcoin analysis in a better light than Ross Ulbricht!

Did not think I would see the word 'probed', 'customs' and 'bitcoin in the same sentence. 
I thought this was going to be a story about a gloved search, trying to recover bitcoins from those hard to reach areas. Ahem. 
@_date: 2013-09-10 10:14:13
They have a little screen on this one.  I think a larger touchscreen style screen will need additional power but should be possible.
@_date: 2013-08-14 14:29:30
Always a risk, don't use money you cannot afford to lose. Look at all options, incl delivery costs, electricity etc. Some more info on KnC -  Seems legit at least and people have visited them. 
Compare miners - 
Good luck

Have used bitbargain and bittylicious. Coinfloor is a new player but I think it is early days.
