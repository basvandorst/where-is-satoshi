It's a bot. They host chat logs for my members to view if they miss the conversation.

I saw a few good scripts I could have used, but I don't have a dedicated machine, and I'd have to host the logs and manually publish them. I'm not an IRC guru and this was simple and cheap for my needs.

Or you could open up a checking account that offers a debit/atm card with free international ATM withdrawals.

Most banks aren't interested in U.S. citizens, especially those without residence in their country. I think this is due to [FACTA]( 
Any specific advice you can give on a specific bank that is verified to open accounts for U.S. citizens, where the application can be completed online/by mail, and without a residence in the bank's country would be *greatly* appreciated.

I'm confused on what ABA means...
"ABA deposits are for US residents only. Non-US residents should choose regular bank wire."

Thanks for the information. I'll wait for the native to come out.
Is Mycelium similar to Electrum? I just want to remember like 12 words and not have to worry about paper wallets, keys, or anything. Trying to keep it simple.
