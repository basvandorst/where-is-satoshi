What kind of project?
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:07:01
10k is the general magic red flag number.... Your bank will flag it and make you fill out paperwork.
Trying to break it down is called structuring and illegal.
You gambled once feeling lucking for round 2?
Or trade btc for silver gold and sell to a refinery at near cost and with drawl 5k.  Just saying... 
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:55:18
Not this shit again
@_date: 2014-01-27 09:34:39
It's a program called sloth claw
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:50:31
And hands you a empty copy or keeps a copy of your code to wipe later.
@_date: 2014-03-02 09:09:03
Thank you for your sacrifice as I almost did it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:43:21
I was being serious.
And would they not just kill him to cover it up?
But in any case, Ill just assume people hacked em unless "RealSolid" proof is presented.
@_date: 2014-04-05 09:10:59
Piss hard enough to slice that log up mate
@_date: 2014-01-01 23:49:32

@_date: 2014-03-02 08:56:24
If this happens we need to ban fox in all forms or this shit will happen again
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:29:07

@_date: 2014-06-04 01:25:21
Not one to condone drug use but hell gotta give them credit for returning lost funds. any bank would be like well its your fault...
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:29:09
So always send 9999999.99999999?
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:33:36
I really like the idea. Almost a more modern take on the postage version.
I see this doing well if handled right.
But only buy tech nerds and tech savvy middle class.
I'm looking forward to seeing this project grow.
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:36:26

@_date: 2014-03-02 09:10:10
What if Internet goes down over there?
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:33:50
They sell gold to recoup operating costs/ loans etc.
And they declare all gains even gold yearly or when ever required.
Only if owner wants to keep gold he can but I don't know how that would work.
Basicly they sell gold overall to cover costs.
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:39:33
Imsure if i recall right I was 117 should have named myself sierra

@_date: 2014-03-26 10:47:58

@_date: 2014-03-14 11:06:53

@_date: 2014-03-17 07:45:46
Don't involve PayPal they will find a way to ruin btc.

@_date: 2014-03-17 11:19:53
Mark found guilty and killed by lawn mower.  Coins recovered... Moon
@_date: 2014-03-17 07:30:11
Doge just makes me smile. The rest piss me off
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:42:33
So you didn't learn the first time and thought it would work a second time?
@_date: 2014-04-01 16:27:06
Interesting idea for a underground stock exchange...
@_date: 2014-06-04 23:29:30

That's kinda close fucking awesome
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:15:51
Wallet though ... Either way my comment still can be read as correct.
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:17:11
Not if every one exits
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:38:49
You use mcxbux as its tied to a dollar.
Also It is safer for the owner to not deal with the mess of shit that comes with cash.
I also like the fact you can earn interest from just having a balance.
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:18:34
Someone should start a bitcoin to cash western union business. Fuck banks reporting my income
@_date: 2013-11-01 06:54:30
Nvm 18 but where?
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:03:32
Where will the money come from.......
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:43:45
War is a bit far who are they going to shoot?
It just feels like if the gov cannot control or get a piece of the action the normal protocol is to outlaw it.
@_date: 2013-11-10 13:22:01
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:31:28
wait there was a time with no DP!!!!!!
true i just have cash in account cash check pull money out from the atm when i leave
@_date: 2013-11-04 08:29:30
Direct deposit, better bank, have money in account....
@_date: 2013-10-31 03:48:14
I use cb why can't we carry a cash balance as well? I hate the fees to sell when I only wanna trade 
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:46:27
Sure it can, New law forces all isps to filter out all bit coin clients.
The Idea a lot harder but Im not talking about that it just seems like its still a bit new with a few problems. Just give it time to improve.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:28:24
What the fuck will they vote on who will enforce ?
Shit link it to video games playing games would be fun if tied to real money 
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:29:41
Would rather own 15 million bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:19:45
seems impossible to get a straight answer with real facts
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:41:22
Sounds like you got a business plan where can i sign up? To bad I fear people would steal if offered the chance.
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:09:04
True but use common sense as well.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:57:54
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:06:09
All risk all broke
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:45:22
well yea 
Im not all that into the hype of BTC but I do see potential in it.
I fear it will fall apart some how or gov will shut it down due to tax,illegal use and from not understanding it.
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:19:59
How does this happen or is it just something client side like hacking or virus?
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:17:52
I wish there was a safe and easy way to buy bitcoins but thats awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-01 06:54:01
2 bucks? Give or take where and what?
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:41:13
Off shtf and the net is gone how do you trade/use them?
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:27:15

@_date: 2013-11-05 20:45:55
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:33:35
Yoda are we going the right way? "Off course we are"
@_date: 2013-11-03 10:42:26
I would be for that but I think no dividend would be better as they can reinvest and grow then do dividends
