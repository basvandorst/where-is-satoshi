Tell me again how bitcoin cash is mad it can't rename itself as the product it wants to ripoff
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:18:11
Why did the dumpster fire ignite again? God forbid it climbed 2%? Really? 
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:38:34
Mildly salty. Not wrong in pointing out its an incredibly emotional market compared to traditional.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:58:37
no u.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:34:09
Why are people dumping? No news? Just because others started dumping? What a great market.
@_date: 2018-09-08 19:13:04
What was the reason today? No reason just needed to dump more? Ok then, next week same time. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 05:52:39
Tfw you traded away your moon ticket for diabetes. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 02:55:37
Came for the salty reply complaining it didn't go up 2000% so literally nothing.... I am shock
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:59:58
This dip is going to be insane
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:19:52
Just use fiat and walk away from the trainwreck that is memecoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:21:46
No. Keep hodl. Moon any minute now. /s

Do you want to lose my business? Because this is how you lose my business.

@_date: 2018-11-15 07:21:28
I just spent 15 minutes using bitcoin to buy an icecream from a street vendor in Uganda. Moon mission back on track.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:08:32
It's ok everyone,I'll be posting a picture of a coffee shop in Istanbul that accepts bitcoin. SAVED!

Half of zero... I'm ready.
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:22:49
No. You won't. Because all the "buyers" will keep sitting on the sidelines singing songs of "when btc hits 1000" and so on. 
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:27:38
New year, same dumps on no news.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:51:04
Shorters getting liquidated and complaining about it because meme lines told them btc was absolutely going to pick a number. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:04:21
Think of the children! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:47:22

@_date: 2018-02-01 11:14:22
TA meme lines apparently. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:03:40
Nah. Sell after it's dipped 15% for no reason in a day. It's definitely not a bottom and will be going to 5K because meme lines. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:56:16
Fucking embarrassing that the market crashes everytime it hits a psychological number or China does X
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:17:34
Love how 85% of the comments here are now BABBY'S 3 day old account.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:29:10
It's much better to depend on a large for profit bank that keeps one ledger and charges significant fees and personal interests instead of a distributed organic market. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:42:19
Nearly to the magic 8000 the meme lines foretold, then to 25k because muh triangles! 
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:03:54
I check and if it has gone up 10% I call into work and drink and get a Thai massage. If it goes down 10% I put my snubnose in my mouth and dry fire it a few times. Otherwise I get up, take a shit, and go to work.

Buy high, sell low, FOMO back in. It's the circle of investment life. 
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:23:16
Just like backt was the moon miracle right? Internet clown coupons.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:01:27

It's that term along with dead cat bounce that every recent adopter name drops in every other post to show that they know what is going on. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:35:20
It's ok everyone, I just drunkenly explained btc to a bartender in Oslo, he nodded and smiled, adoption imminent
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:15:23
Correct. It already went up, so it has to go to zero, basic gravity sciences. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:00:54
It's almost like people get mad when they lose 3% to.... no news, just another 3%... but they come here to check and the top post of the day is initials in an arcade machine from the 80s... and just like that they realize they bought internet clown coupons. Weird. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 22:09:39
No news? Dump it.
Bad news? Dump it.
Good news? Dump it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:36:24

@_date: 2018-12-05 23:53:04
