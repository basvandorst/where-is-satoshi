Are you trying to find out which coin to invest in? educate yourself? win a discussion? tx/second is not the only attribute of design

The provider does not pay the 3% fee for your btc payment. He saves 3% on every purchase which means he will give a discount on goods payed with btc. It has nothing to do with degree of adoption

Without discussing the subtleties in this case. If deliberately you make profit selling something that is different from what you say it is, it would be illegal. independent of it being cheap electronics from China, oranges or cryptocurrency.
Purely hypothetically: If in another universe a person came out and told the world he had promoted bitcorn as the real bitcoin in order to be able to keep profiting from selling his patented and specialized mining equipment. Would you say this person did something illegal?
If the pre-story was that 10 000 people bought bitcorn for theire hard earned cash in the belief that it was bitcoin they were buying. And after bitcorn for some reason crashed, a lawsuit rised. If it was common knowledge that bitcorn was promoted as something else to make profit, Which side would you bet on in the court?

We skip the technical discussion and just state that one currency is more efficient than another currency. Lets say this currency finds an equilibrium where its being used to express 1 % of the total value in the world, i.e. due to technical constraints. 
worlds wealth are estimated at 280 trillions usd, 1% divided by 21 million coins are roughly 100k usd. This is one angle for valuation.

We have detailed plans of how to make it to the roof today. But how to get to the point to where we are now has been an development, i.e. for thousands of years ago the plans for making a house with roof was non existing. someone, combined with collective effort, had to find out how to build feasible artifical "caves". The roof was a process. not a blueprint handed to us. And we couldn`t envision houses looking like they do now before we started trying to build them. 
If people shout "buy bitcoin" I think it`s unwise. though it is something that`s hard to avoid. That behaviour will arise in an environment where money could be earned. This said, I feel the major weight of advices around buying bitcoin lies around "this is very uncertain, don`t buy more than you`re willing to loose."

I don't know if it is not the straw roof. Though from a standpoint where i have not financially sinked my anchor into bitcoin, I can say without to much emotional involvement that I feel lightning, rootstock and sidechains, seems the most feasible nails, hammers and logs. If we could discuss these matters, how they work, what theire effects where etc, that would be interesting! Without doing it in a context where we switch from dismissing and praising the whole idea from a second to another

If demand for that other coin skyrockets it will face the restrictions of its design. Don't deny this

I respect your views. Though I gotta say, within a more narrow everyday context, knowingly selling something as something else to achieve profit is actually illegal by law. It 's hard to argue that it is not a sensible law. And it doesn't matter what it is you're selling. 
If this is ethics that alligns with ones worldview, the way one would handle in such a situation if it occured would in some way be directed against ending that kind of behaviour. This is the motive of law as well. Though one could most surely argue that law is not a perfect representations of the ethics that govern people.

Don't try to eat the whole cake at once. Anything that ever was made went through a development process. The word making implies development. 
Saying "nooo this cannot work we dont have a roof yet" when youre just finished doing the ground preparations of your house. 
Development in this area happens in an evironment of open source, free competition and global information flow. Evolution and turn of events within such a system is beyond manlings to fully know. Saying no when building the Floor is a negative contribution to the finished house. and Though it might look a bit lik healthy sceptisism, it is not, because integrity to the weighing arguments in both sides of the case is not met. And btw we dont know what the house will look like.

Risk everything for some weeks in red? That doesnt make sense. Imagine you own å warehouse with miners worth double digit millions

This is not a factory finished product handed to you. "Buhu muh coin doesn't work like the others mommy, people are not spending it." Go ahead fool yourself if you think that this is a requirement for decentralized cryptographic currency to emerge. If you think it fails let it fail. Btc price is as arbitrary as the people who don't see its use-case
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:29:30
You have to count for the incentive to protect investments and potential future revenue. If this is added, depending on your outloooks, many would consider it profitable to mine for a loss for some time.
"If proof of work is gone my equipment is worthless" neat interaction

It seems like you agree that it would be unwise that people suddenly stoped mining as it would result in a dead chain, why don't you think miners see this ås well? 
Further, this requires a seemingly coordinated stop in mining. How could this happen? Even though the price drops å lot really fast so the most efficient mining equipment is below profit, I don't think  all mining would suddenly stop. There would be people believing crypto is dead, there would be people believing it was a storm to ride off, there would be people unaware of the exact situation.
And panic is something that occurs when theres much at stake. Going below profit for a short term is not a panic inducing state. The stupidest thing you could do is to destroy your venue of operation by stopping. If you could pay a tiny part of the value of your miners to fuel them with electricity for some weeks in hopes that it would blow of, it would be a super low risk/high reward gamble. 
Another small point, btc is getting more profitable to mine relative to other coins these days.
If mining dies of I see it happening gradually, not suddenly. Much because of people not having "one"/the same response to the market, people view things differently e.g. future value of bitcoin. If it dies of gradually it will at one point stabilize. Thinking it will  die of suddenly is a product of fud imo. In a scenario with further downward prices I think people instead will go long times without profit before switching of theire equipment. leaving the more efficient equipment and gradually lowering difficulty. 
Sorry, im blowing of some steam here. Interesting to hear about the proposal of the 3k limit, even though I don't think it would lead to å downfall

In your opening post you should include the information that you are dealing with customers who want to invest all theire money into this. The wast majority of bitcoiners would never advise this at all, we are all aware of the unknowns. 
No matter how much you dig, you wont find information that makes you sleep well if you allocate all your customers money to crypto. It has been a rocky road and will continue to be. 
Just advice not to invest all money as that seems to be your stance. are there other motives at play here than mere interest from your side? In form of higher company revenues when landing larger contracts? Peer presure from clients?

Compare fiat and crypto i.e. btc. Btc is a currency without possibility of inflation. Poor and lesser developed countries have a higher chance of having a more unstable currency than developed countries. Due to corruption in hand with inflation for example. If the people had a choice where the fruits of theire efforts could not be subjected to this threat that is the same as making it better for those people.  
I don`t think there`s much more to it than that. Though this alone is potentially quite powerful

Then why the f.. are you dabling in theoretical discussions about the future usecase of this?? Have some integrity
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:41:01
Face palm... that is the effect of inflation vs non-inflation on spending which you too have argued. 
You can't fucking afford that shit waste because the opportunity value in the future is higher than in a system with inflation. = less consumption

Population growth. Climate changes. GG. If you're lucky you wont live long enough to witness the imminent chaos caused by unsustainability of the paradigm you support
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:52:55
rising - making it tougher to profit. Decreasing - people stop mining. the worst tech stops first. Mining with loss could easily be argued reasonable looking at the history of the market. Some will not, many will. If you only factor in the level where mining becomes unprofitable  at current moment you fail to account for the future and past. 
No, fud is illogical, bubbles are lack of fundamentals
You don't just shut it down before testing the waters. Its something with considerable worth. People have different points of exit. give me a 4 week retarget, I don't care

I belive this statement to be true with the technical perspective regarding amount, fixed vs non-fixed.
Politics live in and around the krypto world, no denying that, but politics power over the value of your money because of inflation is gone.
Like gold. In old times, politics were made to acquire gold i.e. by chopping the heads of the neighbours. But politics cant make more gold.

"but have no incentive to do so themselves. This creates an unsustainable system"
You have an incentive to buy food if you're hungry. "Unsustainable" - no! Inflation - the opposite, is unsustainable. This is the definition of sustainability.....

Hey brotha. If there is an aspect that doesnt align with the perfect scenario it still doesn't make the whole thing useless. The world is not Black and white, this thing is not yes or no, it's more complex than that.

Your point is great. Embedding ethics into our hardware. Which also kinda takes it out of the realm of our tampering, which can be said to be the same as making it politically irrelevant. ;)   
Technology which manages to imbed ethics in itself like this is beyond valuable. 
I would say it's Even beyond the internet and pretty damn near the condom. A lil for the lulls there, but still..
