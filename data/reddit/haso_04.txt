Yep. Great reference - Reza Alsan has an awesome book “Zealot” on Jesus. 
And while we’re at it “No god but God” for the Prophet Muhammad.
Whether ur religious or not these guys were egalitarian revolutionaries who reformed society heavily skewed to the elite. Fantastic reads both of them.
Bitcoin/crypto looks to be a tool/system that is playing a part in doing something similar (but in a very different way) thousands of years after those great men. Interesting times indeed and the story’s just unfolding.

Yea he’s been consistent with his principles. I wonder though while he makes good sense on the world moving back to a gold backed currency, I’ve not heard heard what the mechanics or how practical implementation of that will work.
Peter readily calls out the US swindled the world in 1971 after gaining the trust decades earlier to have the USD as the world reserve currency.
So the question is, given that history, it’s unlikely any nation would trust another to manage the gold backing of some new currency, so how on earth can all nations come to an agreement on how a gold backed system would work? Bitcoin seems to be a pretty handy enabler of that or at least holds the right fundamental principles.
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:12:32
So Germany had much of their gold effectively confiscated once Nixon moved away from the gold standard right? 
Might they move into a reserve of BTC as a belated counterbalance?

Brilliant. Fantastic context on the big picture. 
All I'll add is that any human created system (democracy, capitalism, nationalism, conservatism etc) is naturally susceptible to the fundamental elements of the human condition - namely greed and power.
So given these human traits will always be around then it's crucially important we have systems that minimise their impact.

I’m about to butcher Saifedean Ammous’s message in his fantastic book (I’m sure most browsing here have heard of): “ the Bitcoin Standard”
Keynesian economics - government issued and and controlled currency and spend for the sake of spending. Spending on anything is good. Result - shithouse investments in projects that only have to do a little better against an inflationary currency that continues to lose value over time. Ie no real value or capital generated for society.
Austrian economics - free market determines  the currency. Capital is accumulated because the currency holds or appreciates in value over time. Therefore only projects and endeavours that offer real value (ie future roi greater the initial investment which would either stay at same value or appreciate if held). Result - real value in capital generated bettering greater society.

Yes ok I agree militarily it worked. 
But from the US objective of either 1. “Spreading democracy in the Middle East” or 2. Further US hegemony/control over the Middle East - shock and Awe *was* and *still is* an utter failure. 
Millions of innocents dead, US causalities, failed states across the Middle East, waste of money that would otherwise have been spent within US boarders. 
I think the same would go for any coordinated attack on bitcoin. There maybe some short term disruption, volatility, but ultimately the anti fragile system continues and those that attacked it would have been a heap better off just to do nothing - just like for Iraq.

Yep, this was the most straightforward. Just an internal IPadd:8333 and connects. (Note: port forwarding to 8333 is needed on the router)
Also it reminded me that this is just using the HODL wallet software to manage sending/receiving transactions and the backend for verification. So for a second I was expecting to see the same transactions sitting on my backend installation - but that’s not the case.

Thanks - no definitely not literal names. I thought the proxy function is able to get them from the conf file.
Good idea though, I will give it a try.
I also thought 127.0.0.1 means a direct (keyboard) connection, which I’m not using. So I also tried replacing 127.0.0.1 with the IP of my local pc I connected to the Pi with (eg 192.1.0.10), then I had an error like (cant remember exactly):
“Err: no path to host”

Not listened to this one but heard Andreas on the show before. Was a tough listen because Joe jumps around through so many different aspects before they’ve actually been addressed leaving a number of topics open ended.

I’d suggest also from the individual “limited experience” perspective that it’s not about pulling ur btc out of an exchange all at once. 
Rather be prudent, test it out with a smaller amount, make sure u understand how that process works and then when comfortable withdraw the rest.

@_date: 2019-01-05 11:10:16
Firstly thanks all who have posted for your help. I’ve made some progress, otherwise would have been getting nowhere.
Here's what happened..when running "pip3 install python-bitcoinlib":
I got the “bash unknown command ‘pip’ ” or something like that.
So I ran:
sudo apt-get install python3-pip 
Which installed successfully.
Then ran:
pip3 install python-bitcoinlib
Which installed python-bitcoinlib-0.10.0 successfully. (Thanks again)
Also did this:
sudo apt-get install python-pip (prob redundant)
pip install python-bitcoinrpc (which I assume makes the module available) which I got from:
and I noticed the example there had a different syntax to what was in the Mastering Bitcoin book (prob more up to date) - eg "bitcoinrpc" not bitcoin.rpc
So I updated my code to:
from bitcoinrpc.authproxy import AuthServiceProxy, JSONRPCException
rpc_connection = AuthServiceProxy("
info = rpc_connection.getblockchaininfo()
Then tried running it and got the following (which is a lot further than where I would be before I started before posting here - thanks again by the way :) )
 'code': -342, 'message': 'non-JSON HTTP response with \'%i %s\' from server' % (http_response.status, http_response.reason)})
bitcoinrpc.authproxy.JSONRPCException: -342: non-JSON HTTP response with '401 Unauthorized' from server
I have the rpc username/pwd set in bitcoin.conf. I wonder if I need to be directly connected with keyboard as im using SSH private/public key putty session to login via my pc/router? (Problem is I don’t have a usb keyboard at the moment :P)
Thanks again - I know im jumping down the rabbit hole with almost no experience (hows the saying go…"a little bit of knowledge..") and that can cause noise for those with the experience.

Edit: for what it’s worth it seems to be when I add this line to the lnd.service file under Execstart:
I get the following error

Honestly, I’d love to see Andreas and Dan Carlin on the one show. Now that will be real quality discussion on how crypto will revolutionise society.
@_date: 2017-09-16 20:20:14
Might be a silly thought, but wonder if the day will come where local banks will say "we accept Bitcoin as payment"? This way they'd be able to amass btc. Imagine all the mortgages ppl cd pay off directly.
Then what?
They'd lose some market share cos those who are out of the rat race won't need to get crazy 30 yr loans..
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:08:10
Agree but the continual evolution and sophistication of cyrpto will probably also mean u get better loan services in that space as opposed what banks offer..
Jeez, banks are doomed if they do and doomed it if they don't hey... :)

Ah, an oldie...but a goodie

Yea apparently the legislation will be for all entities "exchanging" dollars to btc. This may stifle business models with small transactions introducing additional red tap to perform kyc for say, just paying a bill, as per the example. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:21:17
Interesting point about impact on retail and small transactions. I wonder if they'll have a minimum threshold, eg only transactions greater than $1000..
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:13:48
I like the “Nixon...die has been cast” comment in relation to 1971 unilateral decision to move away from the gold standard. 
Even if the world wishes to leave the USD and return to gold, how on earth can that be practically implemented?  
I’d love for Peter Schiff to answer this Q as he believes we will return to gold. How?
Bitcoin’s rise to world reserve status (or a significant proportion of) may very well be an organic transaction to the new de facto state. Nations/international organisations that choose to leave the status quo behind can simply do so by transacting with their peer in bitcoin - no complex treaties/agreements/multiple exchanges rates - just the ability to transact with one unit of account with a stock to flow that cannot be manipulated through supply.

Probably answered many times before but as I’ve just seen this now I’ll ask the obvious question....How does Lightning allow fractions of Satoshi? Is it just rounded off to nearest Satoshi when the channel is closed/contract ended upon transmitting on the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:01:06
Happy New Years :) 
Nothing like starting 2019 with that sense of having implemented my own full node and establishing some monetary sovereignty. Said it before while I was part way through - fantastic guide.
And as a guide I appreciate it has that balance between making progress with limited context. I’m just more curious now and after that further detail/context.
Not sure if something like this exists yet or is even relevant (and maybe the link below answers my questions) but I’m after something to give me further conceptual grounding and detail in how it all works. 
 
Eg, Have a clear conceptual view of the Linux file structure for holding all the necessary bitcoin backend and Lnd data/files
How to create/manage the Security certs and config files
Processing - ie what happens to the files/data structure when say:
Wallets are creates
Peers connected/disconnected 
Channels opened/closed
Transactions made
Debugging tracking transactions and issues
Thinking about it, im probably after something similar to Andreas’s “Mastering Bitcoin” hehe but I’d guess for the moment it’s probably a matter of investigating various docs/links/material (including using the link above) to build up that picture.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:11:14

Why would or should the Bulgaria gov reveal the public addresses? That would not be in their interest. Personally, the best approach for any country would be to accumulate quietly, so not to push the price up drastically in the short term.
@_date: 2017-06-30 01:33:46
Question - and apologies if it's been answered above - but in terms of Ether for instance, there'd be no technical impact at all from a potential BTC split right? (Ie Independent technology/ledger). So the impacts in this case (on Ether and I guess any other non-btc crypto) would be more to do with perceptions of crypto and volatility in trading then?
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:01:41
Anything definitive from Jaxx and blockchain in whether have come out in support or not?

Thanks. Sorted, connected to the Y’all node (and waited a while as I think there’s some number of confirmations (6?) before the channels valid) and it worked.  
Also starblocks worked too, I’m wondering if the Y’all connection opened up a path.
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:25:02
Awesome guide. I’m so close but keep getting the following for both testnet Starblocks and Y’alls:
