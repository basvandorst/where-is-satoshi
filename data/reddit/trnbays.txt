Why not buy it direct from Innosilicon for less?  Plus less chance of scam.  Innosilicon makes a good product but it is also sensitive.  I haven’t had good luck with their psu which fails at an abnormally high rate.  Integrated units like that are riskier and harder to repair.
16 cents is pricey to mine, so stay safe out there.   If the market crashes so do asic prices.

I got it from the future.   
Actually I pulled it out of my ass but I suspect that is actually a gateway to the future.   A lot of people that make predictions about the future have this gateway.   It’s also possible no one knows and the future will surprise us.

That’s generally true with a notable exception.  In the summer time during peak hours there are several hours a day I generate more energy then I can store.  So it is otherwise wasted.  However the impact is minimal as the units set to run during this time are usually the least efficient and the time they run makes it a very fringe impact.   The same can be said for other renewables, most have time periods they generate in excess of what storage is because it is seasonal (high wind periods, rainy season, long sunny day periods, etc).   
I had to comment though as it comes up so much in this thread by people who don’t seem to really have any real life experience with solar.  It sounds good, and in certain cases can be good, but is not for everyone and I would dare say not for most.  People don’t just throw down a solar panel and plug it in.   It requires multiple panels for most ASICS, lots of storage/battery, and other equipment like inverters.  Then outside of that is is wildly inconsistent in generating electricity.

Solar is not the ideal renewable to mine bitcoin.  People that say this usually don’t have solar.  Solar is awesome for bitcoin mining for several hours a day (depending widely on where you are and the season) but is crazy inconsistent without huge battery backups or grid tie in.

I for one am excited to complain about the increase in difficulty in 2020 (didn’t see it coming!), the new machines which are 10x more efficient but integrate the psu and other parts making them not very flexible (back in the day you could mine a bitcoin with a cpu!), and why blockchain.info still hasn’t implemented segwit (working on it!).   Outside of the fact with inflation $20,000 will be less then that in today’s dollars based on some kind of inflation.

The real question is always in the comments.  
As a user of BTC, BCH, LTC, ETH, etc my frustration has been for several months last year BTC could not be used without massive fees.  Segwit has been a godsend.  Whether I wanted to or not I basically was forced to use LTC and BCH.  Thankfully I can take a "mine them all" approach but that can't be the practical solution for most people.  Current plans look like the right approach for the long term but I can't find a reason why there cannot also be short term changes as well.

They are assuming you want to mine bitcoin, as this s a bitcoin sub.   Basic research online will very quickly tell. You to mine bitcoin you need a dedicated asic miner that mines sha-256.   Bitmain, Innosilicon, Canaan Creative are all examples of companies that make ASICS for the purpose of mining bitcoin.  A cpu and GPU just can’t even remotely keep up and are useless for mining bitcoin directly.
If you want to mine cryptocurrency your machine can do it, but don’t expect much with just one GPU.   Given you are not experienced I recommend you download nicehash which will run on windows and mine whatever but pay you in bitcoin.   It is not the most efficient way to mine but will give you a starting point and chances are good you could earn $1 / day mining.  But maybe not it is highly volatile.   To mine seriously you need multiple gpus or an asic or an fpga machine.   Good luck in your journey!

I realize this is an unpopular opinion in this sub but 吳忌寒 (Jihan Wu) has done a phenomenal job executing in building a large company that out performed every other sha-256 mining manufacturer for a period of time.  He made some mistakes, notably the BCH debacle, but what he accomplished is incredible.   Investors are responsible for their own diligence and I believe if you water boarded Jihan he really truly believed the outlook.  Naive, maybe.  Over optimistic?  Obviously.   Overall he doesn’t need to worry about his reputation and unless he just quits because he has made enough now I would never bet against him.   Lots of people have good ideas in business, very few can actually execute.

First of all, no one on the internet is your friend.   I say this as it is clear you are pretty naive and innocent, both great qualities you should guard as long as possible.   But do t take financial advice from anonymous posters, many of whom have agenda, and be skeptical and cautious of any advice.   Depending on your talents, hooking often involves blowing guys at trucks stops for cash or hopefully bitcoin.  Unfortunately many will want to pay in Tron.   So it is a tough life and not for most people.   Good luck in finding a path forward, this probably isn’t the right alley to look down but also not the worst.  Stay safe on your journey.

Yes if you live in the United States and don’t travel then maybe a reason is concern over national debt, however I agree that is a stretch at least in the near term.  And the reality is the US is the biggest economy.   But as soon as we get to the second largest economy, China, the use case comes in pretty heavy.   Currency controls are stringent, you can’t freely exchange the renminbi* (*well this is complicated and is another post).   The bank can and will run out of cash at peak times and you have to come back tomorrow.   It so happens the number 2 economy also has the most people.   So looking at big populations, Indian, China, Indonesia....   lots of use cases there.   How would you classify mass adoption?  Meaning Americans who don’t travel much?

Electricity is not "cheaper" in China.  Electricity is cheapest in places with Hydro and GeoThermal.  China is a big country with a huge huge population.  Like many large countries, including the United States, Canada, and Russia, some areas of the country have cheap electricity.  Some do not.  
It kind of bothers me sometimes when people use "China" as an answer when the country is 1.4 billion people with a huge land area.  Also, in China, people often disagree with each other.  It isn't like one person controls the whole country.  Not even Winnie the Pooh could do that for all the honey in the world.

That said, he/she (wait how would they identify) might use bitcoin at Starbucks in different countries on the same day.  My personal record is 3 different Starbucks in 3 different countries in one day.  Changing money when only there an hour is a pain.
Another situation is he/she lives in a country where they can randomly freeze your funds because.   This happened to me twice.  Bitcoin hard to do that. 
Another situation is you live in a high inflation country that has a Starbucks.  Like turkey.  You might not trust the central bank to control inflation so hedging your currency in bitcoin could be an option.  But still need coffee.

Take the ROI calculators online and shove them up someone’s a*** as it only accounts for difficulty at that moment which is ridiculous and extremely misleading.  Many people in this sub call them scams because cloud mining is for people who don’t like to read and think there is easy money to be made and people are happy to give it to you.  
Buying hardware can be profitable but it isn’t for most people.  You need an almost perfect storm of having a location that can handle heat and noise, low electric, and some basic knowledge or patience in trial and error.  Asics are crazy loud and crazy hot and the newer models draw so much electric you really need to be careful your wiring can handle it.
If that doesn’t scare you off then let me know.

Well this is partially true but you are committing Bitcoin to a channel or channels.  While your bitcoin is in a channel you can’t move it until you close the channel to make sure all settlements (IOUs) have taken place.  The bitcoin network is the ultimate settlement layer, which provides the security the huge hash rate of the network has instead of an alt coin that might not be the top coin in its own algorithm (but may be “faster” then bitcoin due to different design or simply less use).  Right now it isn’t the easiest thing to set up a lightening node but if you can afford the time it is worth while learning the pros and cons by first hand experience.   There are still issues that need to be improved but it does potentially provide an elegant solution for the “snack machine” dilemma.

Excellent!   I was pretty worried about the downturn given how many hours it has gone on.
As a whale (miner) I would like to point out:
1).   Getting advice from the internet is always where you should get price info.  If I didn’t follow this rule I would have missed out on kind hearted people who informed me of my princeship in Nigeria.  I have more money then your country but it never hurts to have more and I will once that wire comes through.
2)   My price analysis graph is based on many technicals.  As this market is not relatively thinly traded between a handful of exchanges I tend to first Analyze, the Search for info, followed by Something else (need to protect my clients). I call this my ASS technique and if you want a piece of it it can be yours for a small amount of Bitcoin (or Litecoin).
Good luck in competing with me in this field.  Maybe you can do it yourself (doubtful) but there is always more room for financial advice on reddit!

U/jtoomim is exactly correct in his answer.   
Outside of that, if you don’t “feel” a slur is derogatory yet the community you use it against does then is it Ok?  If so let’s open Pandora’s box of racist statements as well since I know quite a few terms that “shouldn’t” offend people but somehow do.  Now if it is a necessity, since typing Bitcoin Cash takes so much time, another option is to use the ticker symbol BCH.  Using a term for the sole purpose of trying to jab at someone is the definition of juvenile behavior.
Severe irony?   While jtoomim is a well known miner and supporter of Bitcoin Cash, I don’t consider myself to be.  I just want some form of cryptocurrency to be widely used.  Very obviously Bitcoin is the OG and if Bitcoin doesn’t make it then likely none will.   That said it isn’t a completion between Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash.   It is a competition between Bitcoin and its variants or offshoots and traditional fiat.

You missed part 2.  After creating Bitcoin, create litecoin with shorter but not too short time blocks and a better algorithm that wasn’t asic resistant but didn’t bend over for ASICS like sha-256.  Then I would make sure the token had the highest hash rate by far in its algo and there were no significant forks.  To keep the controversy down Satoshi might dump a million coins on the market at any moment I would openly sell all my coins but keep some other coins like Nano and btc to stay in the game, avoiding the disaster situation CSW (club name: Satoshi), coin geek (by dominating hash), and bitmain (a million bch) have created by generally forking things up.

A hardware wallet is a device that stores your private keys.  It is considered very secure as the attack vectors are extremely small if someone wants to try to hack you.  The issue with an exchange is simply you have to trust their security is good, while they face far more security issues as they need to keep coins liquid, have thousands of users, and are online 24-7-365.  Another common option, which is free, is a paper wallet.  However paper wallets come with some distinct pros and cons as well and are harder to use safely if you are new.  Being an advocate for your own security, that is being responsible for your own security, is an important part of using or owning cryptocurrency.  Because this is challenging for new users a hardware wallet can make a lot of sense as it simplifies this for you and your main role then becomes making sure you don't leave it plugged in all the time.
Two of the most popular hardware wallets are made by Trezor and Ledger.
Trezor: [
Ledger: [
You should always get your hardware ledger from the manufacturer if you can.  The Trezor uses a USB-C connection, handy if you use a newer Mac.  The Ledger uses a Micro-USB or their newest version uses Bluetooth (I am personally not a fan of the Bluetooth option).  
If you chose to buy a hardware wallet they will have instructions on how to save your crypto to the wallet.  There are quite a few other hardware wallets out there as well I am just noting what are probably the two most popular wallets for you so you get the idea.

So hard then soft.  Is there a sign to pullout?  Or just go with whatever.  I would feel better with protection.
But yes, the user experience still needs a lot of work.  Decentralized consensus is the greatest virtue by far.  Everyone says "blockchain" but that means nothing if it is not distributed and immutable.  
@_date: 2019-01-01 06:40:48
I have used it, it works great.  For BCH.  The main problem with the wallet is it suggests BCH is Bitcoin, which is ridiculous.   If you measure by work done (and related hash rate) btc is so far ahead it isn’t a conversation.  If you factor by nodes, well, same thing.   But the wallet works well for BCH and their support is great.  
I have also used blockchain.info, its core problem (pun intended) is it doesn’t use Segwit and they have lame excuses about saying they are trying to implement it.  This doesn’t seem genuine as it would be done by now if they were.  The wallet itself though works fine.
My vote for a mobile bitcoin wallet would probably be Bread.

A mobile wallet and a hardware wallet would be two different wallets.  Hardware wallets are considered more secure precisely because they are not connected to the internet or any other connection to the outside.  That said, Ledger Nano's new hardware wallet has bluetooth connectivity so you can do exactly what you are proposing:  sending crypto from a mobile device without hooking the hardware wallet up to a computer by physical cable first.  Some people don't like bluetooth as they consider it an unnecessary risk, however it would be considered much safer to use a bluetooth connected hardware wallet such as Ledger in conjunction with a phone then a phone wallet by itself.  In general it would be risky to put a lot of cryptocurrency into a phone wallet as there are so many attack vectors to a device that is connected to the outside world 24-7, often in more ways then one (Wi-fi, cell, bluetooth, USB cable, etc), runs a browser, plus runs a wide range of easily downloadable programs which all require you to trust them.  That said, don't buy a tin foil hat if you only have a small amount of crypto as chances are high the phone wallet is safe.  It is when you don't accept the phrase "chances are high" as being too risky that you should look into a hardware wallet as an extra layer of protection.

I disagree.  I have been mining bch abc since the split and don’t regret it at all.   To say I was a tiny tiny part of helping boot out Craig Wright and to have participated in that event was just so much fun.   Also I am not an idiot, well maybe, but my miners could earn $0 a day it wouldn’t make me broke.  There is a LOT of middle ground between broke and Jeff Bezos level.   Well, also I don’t have that many sha256 mostly I just like to buy them like a horrible side hobby to scrypt mining.  I see a new sha256 and have to buy it.  I am not anti BCH but BTC is the real Bitcoin.  It is like watching a super bowl where you want one team to lose, not because you want one team to win.   Opportunity cost lost mining bch?  Absolutely worth it that was fabulous.  Like an admission ticket to a great show in what had gotten routine.    Now to go back to mining btc shortly, need to determine which pool as I switch off Bitcoin.com pool.

ABC wants to keep 32 MB block sizes for now.  SV wants to remove the cap on block sizes.  There are other differences but that is a big one.
ABC is heavily influenced by Bitmain, SV is heavily influenced by Craig Wright.
The other main difference is a battle over op codes.   Craig Wright prefers these limited, saying if BCH were private which some op codes might allow this would be illegal and an illegal version of Bitcoin would be useless.   
It’s kind of an interesting discussion and although I don’t agree I enjoy reading some of Dr Wright’s articles.   If in his new found wealth he could learn the value of humility at times and not just make ridiculous self serving claims that are not only unnecessary but also hard to believe he could add value to the discussion.  As it is however you really have to try hard to find good things as it seems his life mission is to become the worlds largest flaming dick.  And not in the good way, imaging John McAfee literally doing this to draw attention to himself and by proxy cryptocurrency at the expense of his dick which has probably been through worse but could also likely handle it.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:12:13
So refreshing to see someone who actually uses and promotes use of BTC instead of more ridiculous pull a hat out of thin air "price predictions" like BTC is a stock.  I get so tired of seeing "expert" analysis of Bitcoin price movement using charts that fit the narrative.  The OMG tomorrow BTC is 10% less, now 15% more!  Maybe we can push the price down and create a giant dickbutt drawing so we can post that on Reddit!  There, at least 7 people will upvote (or downvote) my post, so I can put "Blockchain influencer" on my LinkedIn.  Plus, let's make petty arguments about why one alt coin is slightly better then another one, making that other one completely worthless.  We can reinforce that with strong arguments like "those inbred shills are getting wrecked!" which adds lots of value and insight.  
Seriously the best part of Bitcoin is when you get to use it globally.  I have used Bitcoin in at least 12 countries to buy everything from beer to T-shirts.  It is so strikingly different then when you use a bank, which often thinks I am on a fraudulent mission because obviously only a hacker would be buying a Starbucks latte in Malaysia with the grand plan to cheat someone out of the equivalent of maybe $5.  I realize people sometimes have a lot of money invested so I want to be respectful of that however if you don't \*use\* cryptocurrency there will be no adoption.  Plus using it has the side benefit of you automatically know something about the person on the other end (shared interest in cryptocurrency).  I wish price was discussed less and more discussion went back to where you can use it.  I have some LTC absolutely burning a hole in my pocket ready to go.

Dogecoin maximalists so tribalistic ��.  What about garlicoin and banano coin?
Seriously though for the new guy, we are referencing meme coins which were basically designed as a joke.  So until you know the differences at least sticking to big daddy Bitcoin is the safest bet.  Just keep in mind however reddit is full of people shilling the coins they own so getting financial advice on reddit just is not a good idea.  The entire market is just crazy volatile so expect it to go down or up by wide percentages in short time frames.   If someone says they know they probably have something to sell you.

There are 100 million ways around the Chinese firewall.  The simplest and most easily available to everyone is a commercial VPN service.  The problem with ordinary commercial VPN services is you can often identify what traffic is part of a VPN and so you can work to try to block them.  Almost every business will use a form of VPN however as just accessing basic services like Dropbox or &lt;insert name of any normal site&gt; is a hassle as you don't know when it will be blocked.  Outside of that, there are quite a few other ways, if you are planning to operate your farm in China you can do a little research using Google (or Bing if you are in China as Bing is not blocked but Google is).  In fact, what we are talking about is a core reason / use case for Bitcoin.  Outside of concerns on fractional reserves, inflation, etc, one concern in many countries is simply the fact currency exchange is heavily restricted no matter the use.  Internet is heavily restricted.  Just regular people doing regular business often get trapped between giant binders of policy.

What it shows an estimate that is roughly correct.  A GTX 1060 3GB will not earn much at this time, but hey, it won't cost you a lot (but you most likely slightly lose money on electricity depending on how much you pay per KwH).  
NiceHash uses your GPU and CPU to try and find the most profitable coin to mine.  It check periodically to see that it is on the most profitable coin, hence NiceHash will download a lot of different miners when you start the program that are capable of mining a wide range of coins.  Whatever it mines it then automatically converts it it BTC for you, while taking a small percentage.  It is never mining SHA-256 coins such as BTC as that would never be the most profitable option to mine using a GPU or CPU unless you had access to a time machine.

Jesus this reminds me of spaceballs when there is a fight essentially between two dicks. 
There is no conspiracy, although it is easy to see why people assume that the way Blockstream positions itself which can be read as either working to maximize their own value within the protocol or taking advantage to force people to use lightening.   It’s also pretty easy to see a lot of dedicated work they put in the space.  
On the other hand there are no “minions” who blindly follow Roger here.  Maybe some.  Most people here I think like to listen to Roger, he is super passionate about Bitcoin, and agree with some of what he says and disagree with other parts.   He is not 100% right all the time and I don’t see anyone rational saying that either.    Most understand it isn’t just as simple as increasing block size, there are a few issues- more then one- that need to be addressed.   Some are easier problems then others.  An even harder question though is is it the right path as it is hard to go back if you do increase block size so choosing to do so is a serious decision.
Regardless, no one is helped by meaningless bickering about who is a sock puppet and who is a minion and who should be using their brain.  The main war is not bch vs btc it is bch/btc vs fiat.

These figures seem very convenient.  A lot of mining is done with hydro power not because people are seeking green fuel they are seeking cheapest energy source.  Pre-existing dams that aren’t built for mining per se just attract miners with cheap electric.  Few miners use solar, so we might as well say hydro here but we don’t because the narrative sounds better.  That doesn’t mean bitcoin mining can’t spur cheap energy innovation, it can and will as it matures.   People are good at being cheap, not as good at doing things for the sake of the environment.  So why not say it that way instead of mask it under the guise of helping the planet.  I agree the figures are highly skeptical and would immediately turn off anyone not into mining who would just say they are completely made up.  Maybe not completely made up but certainly statistics designed to fit a narrative which is almost as bad.

This is a pretty ridiculous chart as countries like China and the US are huge and both have super low electrical and fairly high depending on where.   The cost in some areas are less then shown.

Trezor uses a usb-c connection, Ledger uses micro-usb.  Both come with a cord that connects to usb-a.   If you have a newer computer with usb-c ports though and have usb-c cords Trezor is a great wallet.  Ledger now comes with Ledger live which you might love or hate depending on where you plug in your ledger.
As the poster below noted a paper wallet can also be a great option depending on how much crypto you have as cost is low.

The Chinese government alone is complicated given the regional and national levels.  The government, companies (not state owned), and the people are three wildly different things.   If anyone can coordinate the efforts of 1.3 billion individuals they probably earn the right to control whatever they want.  Problem is, no one can.  China is a huge huge huge country that has an unbelievably large population.  The national government struggles at times to get the regional governments to do what they want there is just no way they could control all the miners, ,any of whom are individuals or private companies.

 Title seems misleading, Bitmain laid off 35 people according to this article.  Coinbase also had small layoffs.  I say small only as in a down market all companies will lay-off non-essential staff.  The bigger story is consensus laying off 13%, far more then bitmain with much lower revenue to begin with.

Closer to 8 billion.  So sorry, I hate to be "that guy."  But 5 billion is too far off.  Yeah I know, it doesn't change your main point I just can't help it.

You are giving way way too much credit to the Chinese government for being that coordinated
