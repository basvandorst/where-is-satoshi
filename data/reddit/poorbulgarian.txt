And what once it gets cloged up due to the growth of use as in BTC they gonna increase the block size from a 8mb to a 16mb one and then 32mb,64mb &amp; so on ? Thats litterly what is happening with fiat at the moment. At a certain point in the future this temporary solution to the problem is gonna cause a iven bigger one &amp; fiat is gonna prove that pretty soon :).

The only thing thats stoping me from investing is the current salary transfer from my home country currency - BGN to - USD cuz its like 2BGN to 1USD + the normal mounthly salary of 650BGN for the country &amp; all the new ICOs.
But my main concern is the ICOs.
Whats ur opinion on them.Because I just see them as a way for a plain sight method of pumping the BTC price.
Brand new ICO
21m coin supply
0.5$ Token Price During ICO sale
21000000 x 0.5$ = 10 500 000 $
10 ICOs with the same specs
- 105 000 000$
Beffor exchanges - we all know how the first few days of a new ICO are op sales.Which are followed up by a huge drop from original ICO price - In othere words a pump &amp; dump.Another lets say 10m from that.
Imagine how much someone can pump the price with that amount of money.
Lets say you could get BTC price to go up with 7% of its current price. If im right that would be around 1100$.
What Ive noticed is that when BTC is going crazy most of the othere crypto currencies are droping in price almost aways.
Now with that 7% pumped BTC you start preparing for a proper pump &amp; dump exept this time on a cheap and fairly known altcoin.
Example 2*
Coin supply - 216,109,007
Price beffor pump 0.05USD
After pump - 2USD
After such a big pump should have more than 70 000 000m of the coins
Put a avrage price of 1$ per coin thats 70 000 000m invested
Following the huge pump.People who bought into the coin during the pump last stages wont sale for sure. + the attention the coin got because of the pump should keep a stabel price allowing for a slow sale - dump of the coin over a certain period of time allowing you to sell above 1.30$ lets take avrage price of 1.50$ per coin sale after the pump. That should be a 35m proffit &amp; the cycle continues or think about BCC and its lending system - invest help us pump and dump and earn % of the proffit based on ur loan. Atleast thats the only thing that I can think of as a explanation about the way the markets have been acting this past few mounths.And its worrying me ALOT! But at the same time the chance of being wrong &amp; missing out on this is just eating me up....
Thanks for the language compliment means a lot :)

Okay so step 1
Get "Food Saver" it a cheap vacuming machine.
Step 2 
Split up ur BTC in 4,5,6 or how many wallets you want.
Step 3 
Store each wallet on a USB
Step 4
Seal each of the usb devices with 3-4 vacumed bags with the Food Saver thingy.
Step 5 
Find a good place to dig &amp; a well sealed box
Rest think you can figure out x)
This is for people looking to go a extra mile :p
