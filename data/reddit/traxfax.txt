Everybody on this sub will tell you to keep buying, personally I sold at 16k, maybe it was a mistake but it just seems to me like the market is due for a correction.  Over 200k unconfirmed transactions, $20 fees, it's getting a bit ridiculous.  I think I'll wait for a dip and buy back in.

This is good to spread, but I seriously don't understand why anybody would trust cloud storage to hold their coins.  Even celebs aren't safe from getting their nudes leaked

It's hard for me to believe satoshi didn't think that this would happen.

yea, but I just hope people are spending their bitcoins, and this shit catches on as a real currency.  Only putting away a little bit that I can afford to burn, 100 bucks a month, hope I don't lose it but if I do I'm fine.

I've heard online that Coinbase doesn't actually sell real bitcoin, that it sells bitcoin2x or something?  Does anybody know if that's true?  Everybody is saying certain things are bitcoin, other people are saying certain things aren't bitcoin, idk.

First time bitcoin buyer.
Was that 2 year dip painful for you guys or did you have faith it was gonna explode like this?  I had thought about buying bitcoin in late 2015 but it had just been going down for so long that I figured it would never go back up.

it's a currency, adopted by tons of retailers, it's real fucking money that you can spend and buy real things with
