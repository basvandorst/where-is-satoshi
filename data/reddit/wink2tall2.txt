As a child, I never would have thought that this movie would have so much relation to Bitcoin. It’s wonderful!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:30:13
Pure gold. Thank you for the laughter!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:46:23
I thought he was due for an upcoming episode?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:09:45
This is the best post of the day.
On a critical note, you failed to mention that the parking on the moon is now 100% no vacancy

His podcast, aside from the MMA stuff, is usually very educational and covers diverse topics with credible guests.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:50:07
You dip
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:24:40
No worries, I’ll just fork Bitcoin and make Bitcoin Javacash so all of the caffeine freaks can buy their coffee.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:13:35
That makes sense I suppose. I know we're a long way off, I'm just picturing what it would be like if bitcoin was to replace cash. This is very interesting!
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:05:25
Without question
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:55:34
Very much so! Unfortunately I didn’t get in until August, just from lack of exposure before then, otherwise I would also have 8 months worth of not drinking piled on top of that as well. Never too late until it is though, right?!
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:25:54
Lol, you got me with hedl ��

I like this
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:44:20
Started doing this very thing myself!
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:11:00
Lol, it is painful to watch people just brush off something we believe so strongly in. I plan on trying to gift a small amount of Bitcoin to a few family members with maybe an instruction packet of some sort for Christmas this year. I think one of them will take interest, but not sure about the other.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:46:58
Hahahahaha, woops!
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:25:25
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:16:40
Oh shoot, didn’t think about that. Maybe I’ll put it in a paper wallet, and hold a copy in my safe in case they lose it. Or just buy bitcoin for them on my wallet, and share the wealth in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:34:55
This is Botcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:20:50
That’s also a great idea. I’m gonna make that my X-Mas wish gift this year.
@_date: 2019-01-25 07:10:08
A lovely idea in practice, may only the best blossom from the seed of a genuine investment.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:32:14
I just bought $50 more today. I'm now where near confident enough to tell you wether now is the best time to buy. I don't know if it will continue to drop, but for me, now was as good a time as any. I will say if I could afford to in eat more than $50 today, I would have.
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:03:51
Only a matter of time!
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:40:59
Not to mention all of the bitcoin ATM's popping up all over the place.

I noticed this too... it discredited every word in the post very quickly for me.
@_date: 2017-09-08 05:14:35
 Not sure how true this is, but entertaining the idea that it were, with Bitcoin gaining traction, how long until the corporations lose too much business to NOT accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:31:58
I see what you did there
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:37:28
That's actually a great way to go about it. Although the pricing would be very different, I could get behind this.
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:35:25
Basically, spend $50 every week, instead of $200 all at once every month.

As far as taxes go, the IRS views crypto as an asset.
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:31:37
I don't think it will go that far, but what do I know?
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:18:51
Not cool

Photo of your ID. And then they will verify you bank account/cc. People have had issues with it, but take your time, read everything, and you should be fine. I didn't really have issues. As for the actual purchase, if you can wait the 7 days it's more cost effective to deposit fiat into Coinbase and then transfer to GDax (basically Coinbase's exchange) and purchase using a limit order. There are no fees to transfer between Coinbase and Gdax, and when you purchase with a limit order, I believe there are no fees except the miner fees.

Bitcoin Gold is in 4 days on 10/25 and the SegWit2X fork is early/mid November.
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:38:39
The picture makes this post! ��

And other times you gotta tip the dip.
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:10:20
Something with futures? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:20:25
Second this. YouTube "How to stop paying coinbase fees" and the first video, by Coin Mastery, gives a decent explanation. And there is no fee to transfer from Coinbase to GDax or vice versa.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:40:51
Not yet anyway ��
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:04:10
My guess, which is worth nothing, would be that we are at the first slump of "hope", right before the blue takes off.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:07:28
Holy forking shirt balls!
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:21:51
I moved to a paper wallet just to be safe.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:05:39
I was under the impression that SegWit was apart of the Bitcoin chain since it wasn’t a hard fork, and the shitcoin forks were Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, and the 2X fork...

Once Coinbase cleans up its customer service department, that’s pretty much settled.
