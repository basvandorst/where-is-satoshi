Wow ... replying to a month old comment. But in response, you're mixing up making payments with currencies and 'modern' payment systems which facilitate making payments with currencies. Modern payment systems act as a trusted third party to transfer your currency. So, paypal for example will take my USD and transfer it to the person I'm trying to pay. The reason we have this middle-man is because there was no way to trust digital transactions back in the day. With Bitcoin, there is no middleman and hence no 'digital payment system.' There is no third party involved directly with the transaction.

Sure, but the guidance is impossible to comply with all of the time. A lot of altcoins have zero USD value -- there's pretty much no way to trade some coins for fiat. But a lot of them have BTC value. I'm assuming in those cases, you would use the 'fair market price' of BTC when you exchange those coins to BTC as your cost basis. There's no reasonable way to work with it otherwise.

There are huge problems with Bitcoin that range from technical to educational, and I'm always amazed how people blindly back bitcoin without knowing what the pitfalls are and how it's not ready quite yet for prime-time.
First, people need to realize you **cannot** equate Bitcoin to a credit card or online payment system like Paypal. Bitcoin is meant to be a digital currency not a digital payment system. Digital payment systems have some controls in place and are designed take on some of the burden of risk involved in a transaction. If I go to a store, for example, the store has a deal in place with a credit card processor to take credit card info and eventually give them money. If there's any fraudulent activities or anything suspicious the payment processor will take care of it (most of it anyway). 
Bitcoin should be considered like cash or a valuable commodity like gold. Imagine, to verify that a $100 bill was legit and not counterfeit the process took ~10 minutes. The majority of institutions wouldn't take the risk -- and they don't. Most places will not accept $100 bills for multiple reasons, one of which is that $100 bills have a much higher counterfeit rate. So, people saying you can just assume the transaction went through -- does that make any sense? You're putting **all** of the risk in this transaction on the store and none on the individual and why should stores bother? Ten minutes is way too long for in-person transactions and the bitcoin folks should probably figure out a way to decrease the block time (and subsequently change the block reward and re-targeting and all of that to compensate).
 
|Digital security is WAY behind digital currency
This isn't entirely true, digital security is here, but it requires quite a bit of knowledge to use and safely. What you're looking for is convenient security mechanisms which are not here and won't be for a few years. Also, imagine your local wallet on your machine akin to hosting your own bank without any federal protection. Any 'cold' storage you use is like your safety deposit box. Nothing, when it comes to cold hard cash is completely safe -- which is the entire reason the FDIC and NCUSIF exist.
Further, Exchanges are **not** banks. This has become painfully clear with the recent exchanges disappearing but their is no assurance of funds when it comes to exchanges -- which is the same risk you take on when using a regular exchange or brokerage. If &lt;enter your brokerage here&gt; disappeared tomorrow, your money would be gone, there's no federal institution guaranteeing your money -- the risk is all on you. This is the same deal with MtGox and BTC-e and all of the others.

How the heck do hobbyist miners account for the tiny micro-payments they get for mining. If someone uses a pool (not p2p) to mine, do they need to keep track of every satoshi they get and figure out the 'fair' market price. Or do they wait until they have a certain amount of BTC (like every milliBTC) and then figure out the market price
