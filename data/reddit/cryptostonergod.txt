More obviously.  I run into noobs all the time every day that didn't know.  It needs to be 100% obvious as heck.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:46:48
Yes, I realize they are a business.  Does that excuse them for not making it crystal clear how they own GDAX and how that you can use it to avoid fees?  That shit should be up on front page.  ETHICS are a thing you know.

I guess I just have a higher sense of ethics and morality and expect and demand more from the world.  You may be ok or maybe even enjoy being a slave to corporations.  I, personally do not and will never stop calling companies out for being shady.

they just kept it down
its going to go up now
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:53:44
I don't care what coin you have lol I day trade with a bot.  Paranoid much?
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:54:25
And that justifies it?  We should just all shrug our shoulders and like, that's cool?
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:57:42
That would be people who shorts on the Futures Contracts that expire or close today.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:47:47
They own GDAX.  They could decide to not allow free tx there too.  I'm not getting the point.  Because they are a business they can ignore common courtesy and ethics?  No wonder 99% of the world is as slave to corporations, they get a pass cuz MAH PROFITS
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:41:52
I second this.  I day trade on binance but I would never store what I am not willing to lose on Coinbase.  And for some reason, that slick Coinbase UI never seems to mention how you can use GDAX, which they OWN as a portal to tx for free. Gee, I wonder why?

Laugh it up buddy, enjoy your slavery.
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:00:40
What happened to you?  Fell off the high horse? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:07:12
*straps in*
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:45:48
Why it bounced of 6k and I bought more right at the bottom.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:06:59
I bet rightnow you wish i wasnt lol.   AND ITS AT 8K AGAIN! Bull run incoming as soon as CHinese New Year is over.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:46:40
You bought crypto and dont have rent money?  That's not very responsible or intelligent.  I have no pity.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:50:24
Oh no, it's retarded!
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:22:26
That's all you got?  I have more BTC.  Do you really want to do a remind me? In a month?  I bet .00005 btc that you don't.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:47:15
Trust me I'm poised and ready.  Bought more BTC at 9k, 7k and then right at the low near 6k.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:46:54
About to make 10% more btc on this next trade....how long have you been doing this?
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:05:49
LOL I love it when I'm right
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:53:00
Yes.  I did.  I have 10% more BTC than I had when I started.  The only thing that matters is getting MORE BTC than I had yesterday.  you can join my discord channel for all the proof and live stream you want.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:49:48
I think it's hilarious that people who can't even read the charts are trying to say what BTC will do.    learn to read charts and markets.  And he's right, your 100 dollars doesn't matter.  90% of the purchases made are by bots with more money than you have made in your entire life.  They are lowering the price on purpose.  Buy more, ride the wave and get ready for a bull run, you know list the charts historical data has proven.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:46:31
Yes...?  Why not?  Riding BCD up and down all day.  Most of us in my discord channel are almost up 10% in BTC today.   Are you ...trying to be funny? or cute?  Not working.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:48:22
LOL Please drop to 3k again.  So I can buy 5x more. I still made 10% this week flipping alts against btc, even with the drop.  BRING IT ON
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:51:22
ACTUAL investment advice is to not have more than 5% in bitcoin, don't invest what you can't lose.  So...your logic is extremely flawed.  Smuggy the smug dude
