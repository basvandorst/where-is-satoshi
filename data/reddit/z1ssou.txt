Actually, hodling like your life doesn’t depend on it would be even better.

Maybe he/she is putting in the first 11k of 110k?
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:43:49
I hope that is a throwaway amount for them.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:17:09
Wouldn’t it be more like a file that everyone can copy but only the one with the key owns it?

Whales moving to the futures market. Not the ones who got lucky years ago and are holding, but the ones who came in already massive to turn quick profits. Why deal with holding stuff on wobbly exchanges when you can eliminate that risk and play the game from the outside?
Edit: Granted, if they do it slowly, the price may not crash, but that requires agreed coordination between all of them, which I reckon is not likely if they are competing with one another.

Ever consider that one BTC could be just a tiny percentage of his/her networth?
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:06:22
Could you get ETH at GDAX and trade the ETH for BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:40:44
Transfer to GDAX for free and send it from GDAX for free.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:53:59
Yup, but if you send it out from Coinbase, there are fees. Fees are absorbed if coins are sent from GDAX instead. Gemini seems to be even better though, but I am still waiting for my account, so I can't really comment.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:08:24
2140 actually.
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:22:28
Why is that not recommended?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:42:00
If you are not relaxed about it, then you are putting in more than you can afford to lose. Whether you have $500k or $200, the point still remains. Risky mentalities can be found in any other market. It isn’t unique to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:23:31
Thanks for clarifying. Yeah, I was wondering about the situation of being stuck while the price swings.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:09:17
Psst, DBZ was referring to BTC in Yen.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:58:10
No problem. I see your point, although bits of it come across a little clouded with the perspective of the underdog not being able to make huge gains. That’s always going to be the case and that’s life. Don’t let the natural unfairness of life stop you from participating in it.
Start small, and with that small root planted, I reckon you will eventually develop a sense for what this market is about. I’m sure that happened when you put in your first dollar into stocks, bonds and real estate.

Just their way of making money.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:03:50
Not at all. It's a pleasure to have discussions like this.
Likewise, I am in a lucky position that Bitcoin is not the least evil option in managing my resources. However, putting myself in the other shoes, what alternatives would I have? I recall a comment on this sub, that with Bitcoin, a person would be able to flee their country and still not be worried that their savings are left behind. It is not unlike cloud storage, with which we can access our data anywhere, with much reduced chance of a centralised loss, such as a fire burning up your precious photos. This particular characteristic of Bitcoin is the most pronounced one for me, especially if you scale the drama down, such that you are able to access and send your money anywhere. This will take time to materialise though.
It is true that many are on this for growing of wealth, and if anything can be learnt from other forms of investing, it's that nothing is certain. There is always a possibility of everything going south. Personally, as much as I put my money into it with support for the cause that it is the people's money, I will not hesitate to say that it is as good as money put into speculation. Compared to the first point above, which I can easily see the value of, the investment aspect is a wild guess at best. My way of managing this is simply diversification.
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:11:34
Like I said, to the world that is not in Bitcoin, it doesn't matter if it's related or not.
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:45:00
Would you rather know that the game existed, with the same desire to play it at that time, but not want to buy it then so that you can get $190 in three years?
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:51:00
Yes, that price difference is 0.5%.
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:08:03
Good move.
At some point, I intend to set price alerts, so that I can log back on to see if shit has really hit the fan or if it's simply another opportunity to buy (like in the past few hours).
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:07:23
This is a time bomb for the reputation of cryptocurrencies, whether it is related or not. The anti-Bitcoin mass can't have a better assist.
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:49:46
Which app is this?
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:44:50
My point is that those who don't know Bitcoin won't know the difference, and would use it to tarnish Bitcoin if/when things go sour. For example, I reckon most of us don't go to the black markets, but that's what's being used to argue against bitcoin, even though fiat can be used for the same purpose.

Why not create a spreadsheet and crunch the numbers for both methods? Just remember to include all fees.
Remember, BTC can fluctuate. It can be down when you finally receive it on the other end, and you'll be getting less back.
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:29:09
In regions scarred by corruption or centralised faults, something like Bitcoin functions like the people's bank. For the lucky ones, Bitcoin can be a speculative tool, but for the others, it can't be worse than what they were dealt with.

The problem is that we do not know the fees that your transactions will be subjected to, as they will differ depending on which provider you use.
FYI, the price you see on Coinbase is before their fees. When you actually want to buy, the price will be marked up by 0.5%, followed by a 1.49% fee.
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:02:27
Nice one!
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:38:38
To create FUD, and when it hits a low-enough price, to buy some for themselves.
