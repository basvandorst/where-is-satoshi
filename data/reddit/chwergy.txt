Can we get this stuff off and into a different subreddit like Please and thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:10:23
Sorry I'm coming from years ago... when the fuck did become all about trading instead of the tech? (+ shit memes)

It scared and awed me how quickly and automatically I voted up.
@_date: 2014-03-29 05:57:01
Just out for a rip are yeh, bud?
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:05:44
I would have offered 0.6-0.8 btc.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:56:13
... That's been going on for quite a while.
@_date: 2017-01-14 06:01:58
could still be there and recoverable. if there were a lot you should probably send hdd to a data recovery service. or do it yourself but sounds like you don't know enough.
Also, the more you use your computer the higher the chance the files will be overwritten.
Sounds like the .dat file you need could still be there as a regular old file on your hdd. Know that the bitcoin-qt client will take a long time to update its version of the blockchain, depending on your internet connection.

I would love in season Avacados. But they would sadly not make the trip unless picked while unripe. Priority would be something I have not tried before. That would be Panapen and Starfruit. Which both look like they wouldn't have issues if packaged properly. What would be a ballpark figure for shipping?
@_date: 2012-10-07 07:56:46
Don't listen to that guy. There is a man selling alpaca socks for BTC, and nobody (I believe) said such nasty words to him. Your posting is welcome here, as is your service. Once you have something packaged and ready to sell, don't advertise it here. There are othere subreddits for that.
@_date: 2012-12-06 16:34:33
I did not say otherwise.
@_date: 2012-10-08 23:46:42
Lightweight? Don't try Arch.. I can tell you'll fail at this point. Arh would be ideal though imho. Crunchbang should work just fine. But even better might be debian wheezy netinst base.
@_date: 2012-10-07 07:52:26
This. First thing I thought was that there is already BitVPS, and now this! Competition in bitcoin shows that the currency is growing, and that is exciting.
@_date: 2012-10-07 22:57:47
Is it cheaper to ship to Chile? It will be about 4 btc for a pound shipping to Canada. I am traveling to Chile in a couple months though.
@_date: 2012-10-07 05:57:01
Mine was Bitcoin Magazine Issue  using bitpay. I quite like bitpay, I used a URI and the process was amazingly seemless on my android phone using the blockchain.info App.

It's seriousness. If everyone did what they loved to do for a living, I believe our culture would be a million times more rich.
@_date: 2012-10-07 23:31:56
Oh yes. There is no time crunch. Send me an email and we can keep in contact.
@_date: 2012-10-08 06:13:13
I'm cumming in your inbox.

I love reddit for this.
@_date: 2012-10-07 22:41:10
It is *totally and completely* irrelevant if you don't want to trade in-person.
@_date: 2012-07-14 17:04:39
I know, right? I think people are getting used to exchanges getting hacked.
@_date: 2012-10-07 22:52:20
rg traded with me for my first trade. On bitcoin-otc. I sent him a pic of my license and all was good. Start with small trades.
@_date: 2012-10-07 20:45:06
I make trades using paypal on bitcoin-otc quite often. You just have to be careful.
@_date: 2012-06-14 19:47:47
This may be why Bitcoin is quickly rising to 6 usd...
@_date: 2012-07-19 06:33:30
Unfortunately it doesn't yet.
@_date: 2012-07-14 16:57:35
That's a real brainwave. Thanks.

Have you considered a solar powered version considering the recent advancement in the field? (quantum dot)
@_date: 2012-10-07 20:08:53
Yes, I would like to see your garden. That would be awesome. I live in Canada on Vancouver Island though.. So I probably won't buy things that cant be dried or toughened up for that long travel time. Contact me at jeremiahjunglas
@_date: 2012-10-07 22:02:52
I've used them before their fees went up, and before they removed HyperWallet transfers. Bought a bunch at 4.5 CAD no problem.
@_date: 2012-10-07 07:16:49
Where do you grow the fresh food?
::Edit:: You can buy some on Bitcoin-otc...

Non entiendo espanol. Yo ablo Castiano un poco.

You can use Bitcoins however you like. You can't avoid fees with CC.

Backups don't do anything to secure your funds from being stolen.

Me three.. What city/area? I'm on Vancouver Island.
@_date: 2012-10-07 19:43:56
Oh. What do you have available for purchase? I would buy dried kidney beans.
@_date: 2012-10-07 08:07:41
I would use blockain.info's wallet service for a more personal account and generate an address from your new wallet there. You could do any number of things from simply having the address on the site (my favourite.. b/c simple) to having a uri.
@_date: 2012-10-07 07:27:08
Neither does Las Vegas.... ;)
@_date: 2012-10-07 19:37:02
Local produce is best sold locally. I think your best bet is to take it so a farmers market and accept USD with a sign saying Bitcoins preferred. That being said.. If I somehow discovered that someone was selling local produce for bitcoins, I would be on there doorstep, kocking. Where are you located?
@_date: 2012-12-03 16:15:06
Though, it takes resources to 'mine' the bitcoin, and there are only a certain amount of them. They seem to me as more of a good than a currency. Still, a currency because it has high value per unit weight (or per unit of energy it takes to use and store them, which differs from person to person by technical ability).
@_date: 2012-10-07 05:35:00
Well.. That graph IS interesting. Looks like bitcoin popularity is going up dramatically. Add to that the reward halving, and Butterfly Labs fantastic products.. its going to be a bumpy ride.
You could also add the variable of an inevitable XXS attack on blockchain.info.
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:13:27
Ignorance really makes me angry. It's your job to either stand up at the meeting and express what you know.. or start a company that shows them their mistake. edit: wither, either
@_date: 2013-08-24 05:45:48
Okay. Perhaps don't prepend 'seriously' next time.
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:52:32

No please, Linux can stay in the hands of the tech savvy. Not everyone is set up to handle Linux (experientially). I mean.. Not that it is difficult for some distros (Ubuntu, Mint, OpenSUSE), but you have to admit that in order to really use GNU/Linux right now, you must posses an advanced skill set in the context of computing.
Also, if EVERYONE used Linux.. It would be a completely different system. I like most Linux systems the way they are. 
@_date: 2013-02-02 20:15:10
Agreed. rg traded with me on there my first time buying with paypal. Helped me set up an ident, too. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:01:04
I am considering to install the satoshis plugin and marketing Cascadia as an economy server backed by bitcoin. I don't like economy plugins, but I do like the idea of being able to earn something while you play.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:07:40
Bitcoin is more like a commodity. It's value is what you make it. If you choose to pay attention to the various exchange service prices then perhaps you are treating it more like a stock. Conversely, you can choose the value of your Bitcoin. People want Bitcoin right now, some don't have the know how to buy from an exchange. You have the power to choose what Bitcoin is worth to you, or to choose to have another decide for you.
If you hold the Bitcoin now, it's your call.
*edit: TL;DR As seen on an Onion node: "Fuck the day traders, take Bitcoin back to its roots!"

I didn't think there were any inherent weaknesses in the Thai Baht that aren't already present in other currencies of its kin.

I would like to be putting my money into something that is more secure than physical fiat, yet still spendable. Bitcoin!
Unfortunately, you hit the nail on the head in citing Bitcoin's instability. Potentially very rewarding doesn't cut it when I would be essentially gambling with my future.
I suppose there isn't much else in the way of keeping cash secure from physical theft. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:38:17
You can do this with Josh Burts server as well, The Bit Mines.
I'm talking trading in-game currency that is backed by bitcoins. You deposit coins, and you get currency in-game. You withdraw in-game currency as bitcoins.

It lost 45% of it's value to you.

Who else in vancouver/vancouver island area accepts bitcoin? Is there a list?

Agreed. Upvoting all 0's on the front page of bitcoin now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:46:51
I really like and believe in Bitcoin, but it seems like a little too much user interference is required.
I'd like a protocol that is bulletproof.. "51%? So what?" "Double spend? No, because..."
Maybe [heaven forbid] bitcoin is just the start, other software could/should be adapted from it?
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:14:00
Canada did the same thing.
