Currency we use (USD, EUR, ...) is not money. These are designed to lose value - all of it in short timespan. If you keep the hot potato, you have no value in 50 years.
I am in EU. Our currency lost 95 % of the value in just 30 years. F\*ck  those people.

Short BTC then &amp; come here 2 years later to tell us how it went.
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:21:26
Seriously? You mean when price dipped on June 27th - so BTC lost to USD what it gained on June 26th? (and not even that much) ...this you want to liken to fatal irreparable rocket crash?

$11,200 ==&gt; $10,700 is no nosedive. Imagine $11,200 ==&gt; $900. You just had bad luck. Don't think about it, don't put emotions into it. Just do cost averaging - the longer the better.

Spend 1k on BTC now, then do cost averaging with savings that you acquire from now on (e.g. buy BTC from now on every month with 15 % of your savings in that month). Do this without emotions for 3 years.

Why do you think it is fake? Are also all the other things (data from the experiments; moon rock/regolith samples that were returned to Earth; vidoes that were recorded - including those that were streamed to TVs in real time) fake?
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:55:36
Look at this fake moon photo:
...clearly again, the horizon is only 30 ft away. All made of flour or plasticine. 
In reality, it is a real photo from a real spacecraft &amp; that crater is 100 km in diameter. 
Another shot from wiki: [ ...here also our distance perception is tricked into believing that the horizon is very near - 1 m perhaps ? - however in reality it is 800+ kms away.

Good for you, at least your brain will not get overloaded. 
Light scattering, refraction and absorption doesn't occur in vacuum - therefore even very distant objects can appear sharp (and of the same color as the close ones). This is interfering with our distance estimation - especially in environments that lack objects we can recognize (and which we can compare by size).
See the example of the Blue mountains here:
...on the moon, mountain range no. 5 would appear far closer. Even absurdly close.
This marble also looks like it is 1 meter away - but in fact it is 300 000+ kms away.

Basically the bitcoins that arrived to your address and are available to be spend from there.

Your tone gives away that you are trolling. But I'll bite.
\&gt; I mean the horizon looks like it's 30 feet away.
This is because of two things:
1. there is vacuum on the moon, so even objects very far (can) appear very sharp
2. there are no distinguishing features on the moon (persons, houses, trees) that you are familiar with and also things that are there look similar from short distance and long distance (regolith looks nearly the same from 1 m and 10 kms and the same also for shadows and all the boulders - house sized boulders that are far look the same as small boulders that are near)
...if you happen to have luck to meet mountaineers who were in high mountains (Himalaya, Karakoram) ask them about this effect - they will tell you that it happened to them, too - even on Earth. The air there is less polluted and thinner and the landscape is barren. They will tell you that things that appeared few hundred meters away were in fact kilometers away.
Some pictures from the moon surface:
...note how small the 7m tall lander looks in the first picture.

Do not watch the price, do cost averaging over 3 years.

Just determine by yourself: 
* how often you are going to buy - e.g. once per 14 days
* how much you will spend in each of the buys (fixed amount of cash spend for every of the buys) - e.g. $100 per each buy (so you are going to spend $200 per month roughly if you buy every 14 days)
...so, if the price of BTC is high, you buy less BTC with your $100, if the price is low, you will get more BTC with each of the buys
You can determine buy interval and amount to spend entirely by yourself - but the trick is to keep those fixed for as long as possible. This will ensure that your emotions will not force you to buy (a lot) when it is high and also not to buy when the price goes down.

cost averaging, guys, cost averaging

Can confirm, happened to me (including the ban).
