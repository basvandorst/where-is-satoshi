Well me and a friend are in the process of buying 5 general bytes atms that we will spread out across the city all of which are going in business we own. I have never heard of open dimes is this something new? We are hoping to spread the crypto gospel to any body that has or not heard about it. Giving people the opportunity to buy using cash will open doors for people who don’t have bank accounts or credit cards. You would be surprised at how many people don’t have access to banks for whatever reason. We see a lot of prepaid cards being used and a lot of payroll cards.  I am offering a pretty big discount to anyone who will pay me in crypto currently as much as 100$ off the price of an iPhone or Samsung.  We are having a hard time finding a bank that will allow us to bank the atm business. Most of the big bank chains won’t support any crypto related businesses.

I own a cellphone store in Indianapolis and I am currently offering a discount on any phone purchase if you pay with crypto! I am installing a bitcoin atm soon to try to give people a chance to buy in cash.

The sales tax will be figured into the price at the time of the sale and it will be paid to the state just like any other sale we do.

A lot of people in my area have never heard of bitcoin. Also a lot of people that barely have bank accounts I am spreading awareness of bitcoin by offering it as payment. Also when I install the atm in my store it will bring a lot of first time buyers even if they are just buying to claim the discount I am offering. Trust me I plan on hodling any payments I collect!

Well not exactly in my case I will accept the crypto and I personally will buy it from my business using my own fiat.  My plan is to keep as much of the crypto as I can.

I own a cellphone store in indianapolis and I offer a nice discount on any phone if you pay in crypto. I am also installing a bitcoin atm soon to help people that don’t have bank accounts buy crypto using cash. I am believer in crypto and want to do everything I can to support and spread the word.
