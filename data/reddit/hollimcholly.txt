It's important to note this would only apply to US businesses and residences, crypto is far bigger than that.

Parity is a fantastic client so I find this quite exciting.
I don't see why they would ever default to anything but the main chain, that was their spec after all.

Congrats, I hope it all goes well.

Ok please take all theses bitcoin from me I trust you.

Blockchain.info used to have a graph for it, have you tried there?

I’m actually shocked and happy to see how much reality is getting thrown around in this thread.
It seems this place just might be becoming less of a “Bitcoin is perfect” eco chamber.

You’re claiming Eth has zero fees?
Research mate.

shapeshift is not a dapp and has nothing to do with Ethereum...
Etherdelta, a decentralised exchange built with smart contracts springs to mind but I'm sure there are better examples.
Most dapps are in or approaching alpha, it's an evolving space.

? I don't get your reply

I have heard reports the large miners are paid to use the excess electricity in the down seasons when there is a large excess available, how true that is I'm not really sure.

I think you're underestimating what a massive problem that would cause.
If China banned mining tomorrow and 95% of miners suddenly went offline, the protocol would pretty much be frozen for months until either a hard-fork to a new PoW algo or the difficulty adjusted very slowly.

Btcmarkets trades bitcoin at a small premium though compared to foreign exchanges but it might even out even including the fees of both.

It's a mix of cheap electricity and fabricating near 100% of the worlds computer chips, leading to a significant advantage.

Can you ELI5 for me why longer blocks times are good in this scenario in your opinion?
It's early morning and my brain is not functioning well yet ;)

You mistakenly think Eth's value proposition revolves around ICO's.
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:03:11
Sorry for the slow reply.
You already have a decent answer below, if 95% of mining dropped off instantly (not trying to spread FUD, I think this is highly highly unlikely to happen) it could take months of blocks only being mined once per hour until a significant of new hash power came online or the difficulty adjustment happened.
Some consider this the bitcoin death spiral, hard choices would need to be made, ie fork to a new Proof of Work and reset difficulty at zero or wait out a period of near complete un-usability of the protocol.

Blockfolio or Coinfolio work well already.
But good luck with your app, you've got some serious competition!
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:04:43
Actually I think you'll find almost all Ether holders are also Bitcoin hodlers so try not to think 'us vs them'.
@_date: 2017-09-23 04:23:58
I doubt thousands of GPU's would make any difference given the current difficulty.
After the difficulty adjustment though that might be something else.

The delusion is strong..
