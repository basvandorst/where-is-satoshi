I've been looking forward to this feature for some time now. Don't need it for every transaction but it will be nice to have the option readily available.

I see what your saying that's why p2p coin mixing is so cool cause how I understand it there won't be a transaction fee for using it just will take a little longer.

That's not bad going to look into it thanks.

Yeah 2 life sentences and it's fed time so no parole only chance is with an appeal and with him being high profile that makes it even less likely. And he also has a couple 10 or so years sentences so he has to appeal all of them and win. 
And fed time is day for day you can get good time but it's only like 10-20% off your sentence.
Really feel bad for the guy but we all make choices and I'm sure he knew the risks he was an intelligent man.

Yeah I agree with a free market and am very against the war on drugs but he knew what he was doing would very likely land him in jail.
 I sold weed and had multiple customers who were terminally ill and are no longer living but I didn't expect the fact that I helped sick people to change the way the justice system handled me.
I'm now a felon and have been incarcerated for what I did and I still don't think what I did was wrong but I accept the fact that what I did was illegal and they punished me for it. 
Just like the quote I left at the bottom said I accept the role of a criminal if that's what it takes to do what I feel is right.

Does running a full node take a lot of bandwidth? I've been tempted to run one but don't want to use a large amount of bandwidth.

Lol I have used Bitcoin for less than legal stuff before but my main use is strictly legal. 
In my past I would have used this feature very often ;) lol

But for a random purchase I don't mind not mixing my coins. If I was selling coin or moving to a new wallet it would be nice to hide my trail as not to reveal the amount I possess.

That's cool will have to get one of those too. I got this cause I had some Leftover btc and these are very cheap and good quality. 
EDIT: I just orders one of them :-) now time to buy some btc when that price drops again. Thanks for the info.

You set your own bip38 passphrase yourself and the private keys are behind the hologram for safe keeping 
@_date: 2014-04-29 08:49:10
Cause it's bip-38 passphrase protected the private key need the passphrase to use it
@_date: 2014-04-29 06:01:10
Yeah i was very satisfied when I finally got it was skeptical at first lol. Just make sure to get multiple of the same card so you can remove the hologram to get your private keys from one and keep the others on

Yeah but this guy supports Bitcoin and I always shop at his store because I want him to make money. He wants it back in the store me and him have been trying to get it back.

Waiting on that correction with a few thousand waiting in my bank account for a buy.

Yeah I moved more than 10k for 70¢ and it confirmed in a matter of minutes. Really amazing when you think of it.
