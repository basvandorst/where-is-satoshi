no way storm is coming 
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:38:58
I also think that's the reason
@_date: 2015-06-05 15:54:51
oh yea, she was.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:39:35
agree wholeheartedly 
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:16:22
same with me 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:50:32
Wow! Great news
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:35:49
Wait a bit and download it for free later 
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:17:59
Amen 
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:14:17
7000? impressive actually 
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:11:39
no one appreciates it yet, but in a little while it's gonna change 
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:04:34
unfortunately. it's a great one
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:40:28
That's huge for Canada! Congrats!
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:53:29
Greece is done, we all have to admit it. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:53:35
agree wholeheartedly. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:45:11
oh god! that's so strange 
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:09:04
and all the guesses are so silly. so all we can do is just wait 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:51:46
yep, you're so right!
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:22:28
yep! same with me. once tried, you wanna download it everywhere!
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:14:12
I also wonder!
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:15:05
yep, best solution possible..
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:24:23
God, I love the quote 
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:04:40
wow! great for Australians
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:45:51
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:01:21
I agree wholeheartedly 
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:30:11
oh, I will!
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:29:16
I also wonder where is it
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:04:02
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:06:48
quite good! 
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:18:22
Agreed. I love it too 
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:28:23
same on  6 plus
@_date: 2015-06-10 19:51:32
ahahah obviously it is
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:52:08
wow, that's huge 
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:51:52
it's a tricky question how would it work 
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:25:06
whole human life in one sentence 
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:28:50
useful news!
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:52:21
same with me, since EVER fiat money should not worry me that way 
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:25:36
like since the breakdown of Ancient Greek 
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:19:09
yes  please !!
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:52:58
good question 
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:53:08
ahaha 
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:15:51
gosh, I thought it was a bit more. So sorry for little Greece. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:14:20
oh believe me, they don't 
@_date: 2015-06-22 19:55:17
I wish we  had much more of those :)
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:34:49
yep, I know ;)
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:51:01
agree! great god indeed. thanks for doing that.
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:00:27
With bitcoin rocks even more!
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:09:57
i also think so
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:06:05
that part is especially right up to the place 
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:00:27
lol 2
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:04:33
good news, but it's better that transactions doubled 
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:14:49
i don't believe many greeks would use that opportunity 
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:18:21
good mention, it really looks so 
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:17:09
it's not 100% that Italy for example is going to end up the same way with Greece 
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:53:30
I do like it. Sounds fair
@_date: 2015-06-17 19:15:42
oh god. I,'m so sorry for these people 
@_date: 2015-06-22 20:12:11
ahahah 
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:17:17
seems so!
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:42:46
dont understand the reason as well 
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:21:13
good job :)
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:46:14
I'll chip as well, although it's not that trustworthy now
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:05:58
oh, I didn't know that
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:18:28
Really? Haven't noticed ever!
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:52:39
that's great!
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:46:54
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:17:35
me either 
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:20:14
the quote is so up to date 
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:45:42
yep, cannot add anything more 
@_date: 2015-06-05 15:59:25
good info, thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:28:56
that's good news!
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:07:45
ahaah I wish it was so
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:20:58
hopefully we'll see it soon
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:10:16
it was interesting to read all your thoughts. I enjoyed the dialog
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:26:01
that's a good point.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:58:12
fat mac ahaha 
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:38:42
yep, they must be really happy
@_date: 2015-06-23 11:57:15
which is absolutely nonsense! 
@_date: 2015-06-15 11:07:29
I guess it depends 
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:20:24
looks great! good job 
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:22:49
ir definitely will! no worries indeed 
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:03:54
and they succeeded I guess!
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:47:22
Italy probably 
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:00:33
it's inevitable... 
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:16:04
yep!! me too 
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:18:03
Me too
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:35:11
Obviously it was
@_date: 2015-06-02 13:44:49
I always knew that
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:23:23
me too.
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:18:56
The only reasonable response in here 
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:18:38
good politics. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 12:04:07
That's so so cool! 
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:24:23
chain is devastating it !
@_date: 2015-06-24 19:26:20
isn't divide and conquer the main politics anthem? 
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:31:46
yep, absolutely true 
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:45:57
who knows, maybe one day dreams come true
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:29:37
as the majority of europeans :) 
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:13:23
Another Galaxy, I'd say
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:12:46
that's the point
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:33:53
another great move in bitcoin's favor!
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:43:51
Well said. But obvious
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:19:44
that's huge
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:00:14
sounds like election speech :)
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:39:39
I also like the moon plan !:)
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:13:59
bitcoin is the only lifeboat for sure 
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:43:27
The same reason why I got involved!
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:24:37
that's the thing!
@_date: 2015-05-11 18:58:55
That's huge!
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:56:32
I'm sure much earlier 
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:30:57
That's huge!
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:40:39
good to see this! great for btc
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:18:09
Exactly! That's what I fear 
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:20:07
he's awesome 
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:12:12
same with me, I always break my cards, don't know why 
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:16:58
and Im going to order it soon as well! I'm sure it's gonna be one of my best of the season. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:21:06
I also think so. Arguable one 
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:57:47
that would be great!
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:11:04
ok, thanks! :)
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:09:56
actually, that scares a bit
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:38:08
how do you do that??
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:06:08
but isn't a year too much?
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:39:24
it really looks so
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:12:47
at the first read, I got shocked :)
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:23:07
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:54:02
god, what's next?
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:03:51
we can create something like that. a website 
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:44:00
Hopefully it's gonna last long!
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:58:42
me too! they're the best truly 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:46:19
I've seen that loooong time ago 
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:21:07
thats huge!!
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:01:46
good point :) 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:08:45
He's come from the future for sure 
@_date: 2015-05-22 16:54:58
that's pity I cannot order from where I live
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:50:49
hopefully will see long term solution soon
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:19:25
so exciting !! proud of bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:18:28
same with me. We'd laugh over today's bitcoin situation. or cry... 
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:08:09
thats why decentralized currency will never work on 100% of its capability unless there're fiat currencies left 
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:46:50
I love Gavin's posts as well, and weekly idea sounds great!! hope we'll see it one day
@_date: 2015-05-22 17:28:49
that's nice. I'd love to see more stuff like that
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:41:45
thanks for writing this. very well-writer article 
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:05:20
aahahha I am !!
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:43:02
agreed. better one
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:36:19
Great post.
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:27:36
good point and I wholeheartedly agree with you
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:50:42
best quote 2015
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:30:57
everyone is saying that now!
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:25:32
they all are much better indeed
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:33:02
Gavin is doing the greatest job! Wow! Applauds! 
@_date: 2015-05-26 17:00:39
So sad :(
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:20:34
that's great! such a big step, I'd say. great job!
@_date: 2015-05-05 20:52:36
dramatically, bitcoin turns into something politically spoiled 
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:18:54
indeed. News are quite inspiring 
@_date: 2015-05-11 19:13:00
never understood as well 
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:20:26
Wow! First place to go when am in Manila :)
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:06:51
That's ridiculous 
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:15:18
that's hilarious! 
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:14:15
that's too utopian  
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:28:16
interesting indeed
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:22:18
great marketing and nothing else!
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:28:14
aside from the fees, you're right 
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:19:18
what  a great article! Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:19:46
agreed. nowadays it's war bringing 
@_date: 2015-05-11 19:13:31
good thing, you're great!
@_date: 2015-05-11 19:06:44
hopefully there will be one
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:38:16
don't bother. one shouldn't expect much 
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:08:46
great post!
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:45:45
sounds pretty good, but will it last long is a question 
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:05:02
thanks for the link!!! very useful!
@_date: 2015-05-06 14:53:32
great work!
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:33:32
wow, that's great!
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:15:41
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:14:50
nope, you're not the only one :) he's hilarious! 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:24:02
Love you site!
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:36:06
indeed! for now its enough 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:26:40
really? i thought only us has this thing
@_date: 2015-05-07 17:16:21
ahhahah  I can't help remembering Rachel from Friends singing it to her daughter to make her laugh :) which makes the song even funnier
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:05:37
just as me. quite catching 
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:21:32
I also don't understand how it's possible 
@_date: 2015-05-25 20:05:04
I'd change too , same problem 
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:48:44
Yep. You're so right!
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:09:19
good concept, but really needs some more work on 
@_date: 2015-05-11 19:00:31
that's wise :)
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:24:04
no one can predict that
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:10:49
how's that possible?? 
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:44:46
That's huge!!! Wow! Congrats!
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:31:31
otherwise so many people wouldn't trust it
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:08:18
and me too! I was really worried about that 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:39:01
that's really huge! good way to promote bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:03:42
Where is it located again? 
@_date: 2015-05-01 09:39:00
much better, but no one uses it
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:37:39
agreed! Also see it that way
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:11:40
bitcoin may never go mainstream, but these ironic comments will!
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:25:26
not successfully 
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:19:40
same  thing 
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:11:51
good job!  step by step and we'll have bitcoin everywhere 
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:34:05
shipping at their expanse and problem solved
@_date: 2015-05-28 16:19:21
doesn't work with my browser :( but anyway say hi to you dog!
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:36:36
id love to ride it once 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:03:45
Great idea, I'm for that
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:16:05
good privacy options :(
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:01:01
why so? 
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:15:43
we'll go much further 
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:01:54
thanks for the information!
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:03:28
me too, but unfortunately it's not 
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:07:55
don't you think the time hasn't gone yet? 
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:16:09
which is strange 
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:55:15
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:48:22
Wow!! That's huge!
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:45:22
I like it! Really great job. Congrats!
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:16:58
I love such news
@_date: 2015-08-17 16:06:08
If they wouldn't be silent there would not be a bitcoin as a system itself 
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:52:39
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:07:19
that's the point. people won't use it 
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:25:57
Ahah mine too!
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:16:07
I guess no one 
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:33:58
What a surprise! 
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:11:46
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:43:52
same with me. agree wholeheartedly 
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:16:39
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:24:47
More than that!
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:19:32
Now refreshing emails became my second Facebook refreshing thing 
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:37:25
That happens from time to time. I think we won't have any problems of that kind in 2-3 years
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:48:52
Yep, and I don't understand why not everyone gets it
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:35:39
Nice move, but that's not this easy 
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:54:43
That's terrifying. Is it what we called democracy and freedom? I'm shocked. America is falling 
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:13:32
with bitcoin, they will buy a lift
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:32:05
Same story! How fast does the technology run! It's awesome when you think of it in this clue 
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:36:20
I would! But just try to explain it to everyone 
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:03:55
200 000 ? wow! I'm shocked 
@_date: 2015-08-15 09:22:25
But anyway I like it 
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:24:21
Why don't you do it yourself? Sounds quite promising.
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:08:22
 Uff, I guess it's huge news. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:16:23
I guess it's obvious. 
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:33:05
interesting post, thanks for the info! was pleasure to read 
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:11:32
yep, me too!  where can we find anything like this?

I love WikiLeaks. Another great campaign 
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:06:52
Are you sure blockchain needs voting ?
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:52:56
Yep. You are dreaming.
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:52:07
I don't believe it neither. That's a really strange situation 
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:08:24
wooden and fire-proof? 
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:56:15
which is most likely true 
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:29:35
That's nonsense. There's nothing that matters in doing that, I  can't see the point in this
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:12:34
That's huge!
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:34:22
can't believe it 
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:08:43
I never knew that. Awful!
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:52:51
That' s a great article. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:36:43
I think the chances are pretty high! Now it's quite promising in any sphere 
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:00:19
hallelujah 
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:18:32
that's just taken from big bang theory 
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:27:47
than it's all clear
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:58:19
Definitely 
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:23:28
The only symptom 
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:25:29
That's huge! Good start up
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:25:10
Seems so !!
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:06:28
Great saying! Why not 
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:08:15
really?? never knew!
@_date: 2015-08-06 07:38:59
good point!
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:01:24
great article! thanks for sharing your thoughts
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:09:00
Congrats anyway !
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:54:05
they were born for each other 
@_date: 2015-08-13 11:52:24
That's a great news!
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:22:45
yep, good question!
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:19:21
Now refreshing emails became my second Facebook refreshing thing 
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:10:53
sounds true :D
@_date: 2015-08-07 07:12:14
Well, it  was obvious 
@_date: 2015-08-04 08:16:41
great job!
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:25:14
That's huge
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:28:11
I never took him seriously
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:07:38
wow, that's great!
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:23:27
that's huge if it actually will be done
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:01:46
100% that's true
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:34:44
yep. They are not the only ones to make changes
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:42:04
Congrats to Cuda! Hope it won't be the first and the last one 
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:07:29
You're right. And the message is good
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:21:24
but anyone who tried telegram stops using whatsapp! telegram is the best, really. fastest, simplest, nice layout, never had any single problem with it. you can download it on the laptop!! so it's a matter of time when they will conquer the market. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:25:09
I guess they will do it asap
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:28:03
Great job! That's a very important beginning as we don't have anything proper about bitcion yet in russia. In mass media, I mean
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:28:21
great dialog 
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:19:11
on such a hot topic! excellent 
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:59:13
That looks much nicer than I expected! Great job!
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:24:25
love news like that. makes believe nothing is impossible with bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-07-30 09:58:16
Quite  possibly, I had same problem once
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:32:42
hopefully it will turn out good for him 
@_date: 2015-07-25 08:15:25
anyway that's nonsense 
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:21:09
wow, great job! I really wish I had one a year ago 
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:44:16
And hardly anyone understands it 
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:56:33
Game theory rules actually. Mathematicians rule the world. It's useful everywhere 
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:33:51
Should really read it! Seems great 
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:58:32
Wow, that's great for Romania!
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:36:35
yep, good example actually 
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:28:41
city with no people! come on
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:52:57
That's so sad, we're running to the end of everything with this large number of users
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:46:31
yep, that's the reason of everything 
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:41:38
I'm not even surprised, Uber's used by the most advanced people now. I won't be surprised when it all turn into only bitcoin transactions. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:23:58
same with me. it looks too ridiculous 
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:27:22
that's huge and awful. how the sites like this still don't have proper secure system
@_date: 2015-08-14 07:18:17
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:13:08
apparently that is the point 
@_date: 2015-07-31 07:53:56
That's how advertising works 
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:09:13
that's the point actually. not too realistic 
@_date: 2015-07-02 14:35:43
yep, thats the point 
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:30:17
I guess they will buy bitcoin anyway. they trust it 
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:23:39
Yep, so true. Love it as well
@_date: 2015-07-30 10:04:24
like the comics! it's really so much true 
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:50:51
not even more?
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:04:59
звучит не очень
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:10:28
Thanks for the clearest description and insightful thoughts. I agree wholeheartedly 
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:47:36
that's great that events like this happen from time to time. good way for bitcoin to spread 
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:08:41
That's a great beginning. Congrats!
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:15:45
i guess that's the thing
@_date: 2015-07-29 11:48:13
Don't think they will let it happen 
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:45:22
wow, that's an impressive prediction considering how steep the market is 
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:53:49
we all will see it soon I'm afraid
@_date: 2015-07-27 09:07:45
thanks 
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:37:02
me neither. it can change everything 
@_date: 2015-07-28 13:23:42
same with me
@_date: 2015-07-30 10:05:59
no one can tell this 
@_date: 2015-07-25 07:42:22
any other currency does have a way more coins
@_date: 2015-07-29 12:00:09
Agree :( unlikely for him 
@_date: 2015-07-30 09:23:06
Cortana carries me away. It's a way better than Siri or anything else of the kind
@_date: 2015-07-30 09:56:33
Agreed. Such posts are almost unique 
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:31:55
good point. agreed
@_date: 2015-08-12 08:10:31
That's great indeed. Good job. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:31:36
wow, that's a huge net value for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:59:27
so exciting!
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:17:13
lots of stuff like this now appears at google. they should do sth with that 
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:18:46
good news for Chile!
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:18:53
happy bday! great b-cake :)
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:50:08
unless it dies first
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:13:55
stylish bike ;)
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:21:23
Good interview. Hope it's sincere
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:26:58
I thought sending bitcoins across the board is something fundamental about btc
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:54:41
Honestly, I agree with him. Now bitcoin can be perceived as 'opposition' to fiat systems. yes, its something revolutionary ,but i don't think that currencies and markets its something that needs that approach 
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:28:34
because we don't speak chinese 
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:13:48
great post! sincerely ,such a pleasure to read 
@_date: 2015-04-12 20:09:38
good question!! never thought about death certificate in these terms before
@_date: 2015-04-08 07:06:03
and who is the one to blame?
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:46:10
wholeheartedly agreed
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:59:24
wow! great thing
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:12:09
strange numbers
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:27:25
me either! that's fantastic
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:34:54
definitely will! anyway good beginning 
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:33:18
That's pity. And not funny at all
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:19:31
craziness. and its sooooooo unfair 
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:14:08
Pretty funny. Thanks!!
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:07:04
conngrats! good luck with that 
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:49:19
me either
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:45:26
ahahaha 
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:41:01
good explanation
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:26:29
they do it all the tine, don't they?
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:10:53
just sit on your spot, consume, don't ever think.  and the system gets you down
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:02:03
happens with me all the time I start talking about my job
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:44:54
judge could be just corrupted as well
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:09:57
yep, that was funny :) good luck you guy!
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:53:50
I don't think bitcoin can actually save the whole economy or even help anyhow
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:37:59
Keep doing the great work! Congrats to you ,guys!
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:28:46
done, thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:21:42
Id love to see that kind of wine bar
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:25:18
so unlikely 
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:13:17
I've seen it like a half of the year ago
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:03:35
cannot agree more
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:39:55
100 agreed. But Silk Road was spreading it which means abusing the crime 
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:59:51
good points. but i guess next round would be better at all
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:22:50
Quite strange land actually. nothing real, nothing stated more or less reasonably 
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:11:20
nice stuff, id like to order one
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:22:45
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:17:08
happy bday,bitcoin
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:33:18
thank you for such an informative post!
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:58:36
good for spain, bad for bitcoin ...
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:05:54
why not to throw a party if you  have an island? 
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:00:24
sure why not
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:51:50
so sweet and nice, and its great you implement bitcoin payments. adds some point to your business
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:02:38
i almost started to believe...
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:10:02
like what? I'm not very informed of anything like that
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:10:44
i like the article , sounds nice
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:31:17
good step for btc anyway!
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:13:38
I mean Ukrainian banks.
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:26:07
what airplane company's that?
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:14:12
Great job! Congrats!
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:17:58
wow, one more reason to go to Vegas :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 07:07:39
strange things happening ,it should work greatly on this highest level
@_date: 2015-04-03 14:11:27
yep , good luck with freedom, America
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:05:48
cleanliness begins at home. thank you, moderators!
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:36:45
ahahhaha 
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:42:50
now more people are likely to buy it ,cause last year's to the moon is still in minds and some hope remains
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:42:52
definitely does
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:52:32
does it  have a notable market share anywhere? I think what you said is possible, but in years
@_date: 2015-04-08 07:07:04
Gavin is great. I love reading such aspiring posts
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:47:17
you're not the only one
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:08:31
exactly. no one thinks about anonymity as takes it for granted
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:03:35
 oscar worth
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:20:48
its gonna be easier when we dont need to have a bank account in order to get bitcoins anymore
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:45:09
each government would !!
@_date: 2015-04-23 15:05:50
looks pretty nice!
@_date: 2015-04-23 15:01:21
looks nice, good job!
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:03:23
I wouldn't trust anything like that
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:57:01
i don't even think bitcoin will 
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:53:34
but what else can you do? what are the alternatives ??
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:05:40
yep, and bitcoin's markets are nothing but an  ordinary stock exchange. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:56:28
that's the country of freedom of speech and thought 
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:52:48
@_date: 2015-04-17 20:39:20
sure, but no one thinks about it 
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:51:18
 i think it's a matter of time
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:50:30
wow! hope it's gonna work in Europe soon. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:18:13
in that case, everything does pay to you vice versa
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:28:18
so great guys that you all do that. Once i run my own business -you'd be great examples of how to do it
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:52:06
thats crazyyyy
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:08:31
hopefully we all won't end up driving that
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:26:59
where was btc in my 17
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:44:17
it will and it will be so much talked about
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:18:50
God, bless bitcoins! 
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:08:35
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:25:33
what a  nonsense. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:23:03
@_date: 2015-04-13 20:53:09
great startup. glorious future is ahead!
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:04:39
wow, i think i gotta preoder it now :)
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:19:43
another crazy idea of someone who needs his 15 minutes of fame 
@_date: 2015-04-23 15:13:40
google should definitely start supporting bitcoin. they're from one league
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:27:40
I always read about it and am so excited! can't wait till it's gonna work world-wide
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:38:48
a million 
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:22:03
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:05:29
definitely 
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:50:22
nice news
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:31:15
wow, you'r great! best news today so far
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:00:39
I think it's only the beginning. Dozens of other Ukrainian  banks are about to go bankrupt next
@_date: 2015-04-08 06:54:18
Great advertising campaign for bitcoin anyway. now its  something everyone is talking about
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:09:29
nice idea 
@_date: 2015-04-23 15:24:56
sure, and another good reason to join bitcoin community in the first place 
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:15:00
hm, don't think so. there're lots of places accepting btc in london anyway! 
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:21:31
I guess we could see it. No good security obtained in btc world
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:44:08
ahahah exactly!
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:57:53
great analysis, interesting to read
@_date: 2015-04-12 20:25:57
full agree, but sth like this can add some point anyway in people's minds 
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:13:20
Hope they will come to Eastern Europe one day
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:40:05
they'll do anything to be able to
@_date: 2015-04-08 07:08:07
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:31:20
great job!
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:08:18
I wonder whether Moscow ever joins the list 
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:22:46
Everyone does! he'll change a lot in the future. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 16:25:58
maybe they had it in the very beginning :)
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:16:27
quite good in the beginning 
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:16:59
donations in btc seem the coolest
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:42:53
Sure! Definitely ,otherwise whats the point of it 
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:10:59
Thats soon cool! good luck them!
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:24:35
great news indeed
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:02:11
technology, not the price?
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:15:49
is it really the most expensive one?
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:16:19
it would surely be quite exciting and millioner-making :D
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:54:02
never heard about it, thanks for the hint ,its kind fun
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:58:28
Personally, I won't be any surprised!
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:39:37
No taxes or vice versa?
@_date: 2015-03-21 07:19:00
it's a really odd choice , you may use whatever currency you want anyway 
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:17:45
Id love to. especially in to the moon cases
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:41:44
for the very first time it is
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:37:46
I read he's not gonna be allowed to tweet in there.
@_date: 2015-03-31 21:27:35
Local businesses getting bitcoin -sounds like a promising startup. you could make a looooot by doing that
@_date: 2015-03-21 07:48:57
thanks so much for the update! 
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:41:04
not easily at all
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:44:19
Great idea, never knew about eGifter. thanks for the hint!

even for those who just begins the whole story  with bitcoins, it can be much simpler  to start with good old tobaccos

@_date: 2015-03-19 18:23:35
I just heard of a couple of newborn companies selling alcohol for bitcoins online, but that sounds much much better. wish they took it not only in Copenhagen. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:59:02
sure, one day for sure! some up-to-date banks may already been implementing it 
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:03:26
one jobs replace others, that's what's been going on for centuries. it's a life. it's normal

@_date: 2015-03-31 21:12:56
the only reason why bitcoin has conquered the world yet.
@_date: 2015-03-20 14:16:28
I wonder when paying with bitcoins eventually becomes  more spread  world-wide, out of the UK and the USA.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:36:00
Sooner or later we'll see that price again
