The biggest property company in the whole of Turkey, selling many hundreds of multi million dollar apartments, also accepts Bitcoin:-

The most prominent sign on the top right.
u/wesmokebitcoins \- clearly you're wrong.

The fact of the matter is Turkey is very advanced with all of this, we have many Lightning Nodes too.

One of us has respect for others. Have a good evening.

why would I care? Do you get upset if a child swears at you? If I'm not Turkish how do I know more about this Country than you do? lol.
"Do you even speak Turkish?" - This is the correct version.

Ok so you accept that they are big companies selling property in Turkey accepting Bitcoin. 
So you were wrong all along and embarrassed yourself for nothing.

No it didn't, not at all. What he said was correct.

You'd be shilling the place too, Fethiye is one of the most beautiful places in the World. Have a good day.

Not much to say to this, other than I'm sorry our education system has failed you so badly.

Ignore this Vlaklak he has issues, have a look my exchange with him in this thread to see all the evidence you need.
Multiple large property vendors, including the very largest, accept Bitcoin for property in Turkey.

That's correct. Here's another scenario, I'm going to buy 100,000btc from someone on a street corner, he says "Ok if you're to buy it then I don't need to sell it on the exchange". Had he sold it on the exchange the price would have dropped 3000USD, but now that doesn't happen. Pretty simple concept, isn't it?

You would say "Are you retarded?". Insulting people when you are proven wrong is very childish.

Don't feel too bad, if you're not clever enough to see through 8th grade marketing tactics it's pretty much certain you didn't have any significant amount of money to lose in the first place. The good news is you saw in time the utter idiocy of rbtc posters' logic so your IQ is over 40, but below 60.

What exactly is my scam? I told you multiple companies in Turkey accept Bitcoin for payment and gave you proof. Meanwhile you thought they didn't, with your only qualification being you're from Turkey.
Well, you were wrong because Antalya homes do and PropertyTurkey do too. Property Turkey is the biggest property company in Turkey - which part of this is a scam? How is them accepting Bitcoin my scam? I've literally nothing to do with either of these companies. As I said, our education system needs a lot of improvement if you're what its producing. What an embarrassment.

I'm struggling to even comprehend your line of thinking right now. 
Are you saying no one has heard of propertyturkey.com? As I've said multiple times now they *are* the biggest property company in Turkey. They also accept Bitcoin. They have articles published in Turkish newspapers and even British ones, there is no lack of credibility surrounding a company with offices in every major City in Turkey and even offices in the UK.
Also, as I've said multiple times they have nothing to do with us. I made this reddit account to link a totally separate business, which isn't even operating and doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin on it.
Seriously, your reading comprehension is terrible. Good luck with your English classes :).

Fethiye and Antalya are two different places, PropertyTurkey and Antalya Homes are two different companies. The company I own is also separate to both of these. 
The point which is clearly evident is that multiple leading Property sellers, on a national level, accept Bitcoin for payment. I also know multiple other companies locally here accepting Bitcoin for their properties.
If you check the lightning network you will see 100+ Turkish nodes and they've been there since week 4 of launch.
I'm not sure what you think I'm shilling other than the fact my Country is far more advanced when it comes to Bitcoin than pretty much anywhere else in the World.
