Bitcoin is not the final product, but a demo of what is possible.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:40:37
Also there are already a lot of Alt coins that do free instant transfers. So this has been fixed.

So if you have money in a bank and they are using that cash to front another customers mortgage are you due the total amount they make off you or nah?

What amazes me is the people complaining about it were the same ones requesting to get the coins the day of the split to sell them for market price which was 300-700.
By coinbase holding you actually made more but want to complain now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:42
How many of you sold at 15k or lower? lmfao
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:52
Watch us break 20k as all the bcash wallets get emptied

Although you’re right the rest of the world is slow and retarded so they prob can’t even complete a sign up and verification.

But but but.... muh coinz

Yea no shit but were all here to cash in. Who gives a shit about what it's purpose is. Buying a shit load right now so I can cash in later next week. Watch.

Yep. Inb4 crash.

Nothing like getting banned from a service for a life time. VPNs are very easy to identify and any time secure details get submitted to me from one I block the client automatically. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:22:44
Nothing like giving away 10% for free. 
Yep sounds true.

Business and gambling are 2 different things.

Its not a Coincidence for one, and you are not the only one. We dont need banks anyway so win/win
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:15:31
Can you blame him? His business is selling something that is now competing with bitcoin. What would you do in his position to tell your clients about bitcoin? SCAM

This subreddit shows that your claim holds no grounds. Everyone is here for a pump and dump. But most are getting dumped.

Coinbase USD Wallet is insured not the bitcoin holdings themselves. 
Here's one hack. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:46:13
Have you seen the massive sell offs or are you sleeping?

Interesting other ted talk 
"How I bought high and sold low"

Fiat Currency
Coinbase stores all customer fiat currency (government-issued currency) in segregated, custodial bank accounts. The funds held in those accounts belong to Coinbase’s customers - not to Coinbase. 
If you are a United States resident, your Coinbase USD Wallet is covered by FDIC insurance, up to a maximum of $250,000.
**Even if Coinbase were to become insolvent, the funds held in the custodial bank accounts could not be claimed by Coinbase or its creditors. The funds held in those accounts would be returnable to Coinbase’s customers.**
Coinbase is not insured against everything. First, only their hot wallet is insured. Second, if they borrow customer bitcoins and then go bankrupt, insurance won't cover that either.
Would you rather keep your money at home/in your pocket or online with a company? Thats the difference. If coinbase decided to file bankruptcy tomorrow and close shop or they get hacked or flag your account for any reason they have your money.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:02:16
Nope wait a couple of weeks for the charts to stabilize then buy. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:52:08
Sold all of my 5 coins at 2500. It's bad out there. Gonna rebuy at 1000-1200 range and repeat like every other bubble. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:36:23
Explains exactly why everyone is going back to USD. gg
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:48:39
Please keep your troll comments out of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:56:08
Isn't FDIC insured was my point.
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:45:05
Would never use btc or cash as payment. I have full protection against a merchant if they pull something shady. On top of that I know 10000% that everyone uses disputes against transactions that didn't go their way. Why would you want to be liable for 100% of what you paid for something if the merchant fucked you over? Lmfao have fun. Everyone accepts it and instantly turns it back to USD anyway. They don't hold it. It's a loss.

There's bitcoin everything. It's a growing market any everyone is cashing in. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:08:10
It's hot because of the gains it was producing for the past month. No other stock came close. If it had true utility it wouldn't lose value at all. Since you can't really use it or do anything with it people are dumping it back to local currency instantly. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:21:48
100% are buying to get rich. I don't see utility yet. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:21:39
Sorry we're all here to make a quick buck. Utility = 0. The only thing I've seen bitcoin good for is ransomware.

My currency in any fdic insured bank get 250k insurance. Bitcoin gets 0 plus the chance of getting hacked which it has already. Not saying banks are the best but you really need to look at your options again. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:30:05
Why would I be trolling? What would I gain? Lmfao
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:57:01
Bitcoin is the equivalent of a blackjack table. Everyone knows it and this is what it is. The top post on this page isn't about the utility it's about him losing over 15k in 3 days. Let's be real and stop trying to push something with no actual value. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:30:07
Buying a company after reviewing years of positive revenue isn't the same as buying something that drops over 30% in 30 days every 6 months and can be hacked.

@_date: 2017-06-23 03:15:12
100%. Nailed it on the head. It's great because as most of us are holding we are not using until we see that something we are trying to buy requires bitcoin only. Then you finally use it. I would like to know the total stats on people using it to buy thing. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:31:39
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:55:16
If that's the case you need to start digging, and digging fast. That can be worth so much.
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:17:00
Wait, crash about to happen then buy when low.

I'm trying to make a prediction that will make history books that your children will read. It all starts here..
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:50:47
We were all jumping up and down when we were at 2700+ and then said to ourselves man I would have loved to buy lower. Well now it's low and you aren't buying. This is the buy high sell low newbies around here. Just hold the coin. If you are freaking out then you put way too much of what you could afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:25:17
Bitcoin works in the merchants favor usually which explains that.
