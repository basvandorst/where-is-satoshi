the "bowl for food" guy gave a lot of funny answers, but I just kept his first one in.
Yeah, spread the word

I know right. But hey, everyone has their own path.

Thanks for watching Lite_Coin_Guy

Oh well...hmmmm.... It was more for a video. 
Not really doing surveys, lol. That sounds boring.
Besides the video doesn't have all the results since we had to cut a lot of it out. 
Still, I hope I managed to entertain you? =)

Really where? I never noticed it, awesome. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:13:28
Good idea. Will definitely look into it. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:15:03
A few knew about it, but only two knew what it really was.

That's my goal with these videos. To spread awareness. Hopefully, by the next video, I can hand out my business cards for CryptoCoinStack.

ah man, you couldn't finish the video =(
Glad you watched it though! 
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:36:43
I guess to some people...

Yeah just like one of the people I talked to, they mentioned how they thought you could only pay with 1 full bitcoin. Until I explained that a bitcoin can be divided into several units.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:35:08
I guess bitcoin might not be for everyone.
