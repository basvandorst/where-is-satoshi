I think BAKKT's rule for physical delivery will affect the market in several aspects, first start a new competition in determination of futures prices, in which BAKKT is a strong competitor and a winner of Bitcoin reserves with ICE endorsement and much more credibility under its physical delivery mechanism. More emulators are estimated to emerge in the future;  More convenient for institutional investors to enter the market And Bakkt Expand the payment scenario for Bitcoin, increasing merchant users and potential consumers.

Yes,Bitcoin is not be able to shut down.But government really could add some diversity to the ecosystem, approving STO, stablecoins, AML etc.  Would be great if governments also embrace it.
