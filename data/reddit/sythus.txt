Is improv considered more comedy or acting? I mean, it might not be "serious" acting, but being told to "act like this" with no rehearsal and then execute is impressive. even more so if it's also funny on top of that.

IMO you should look into whether the person being tied can be rehabilitated. From the sound of it, El Chapo would not be able to. I don't know enough about this other guy, but I could imagine he tried doing the hits to protect himself, because he was scared. Did any of the hits seem like he was just being the aggressor? Like, completely unprovoked, or was it usually a response he had due to something that could jeopardize him?
I'm not saying it's excusable, but the intent behind things can help decide whether somebody is able to be rehabilitated.

I can't speak for others, but i like to discuss things, who what when where why how, all of that. i don't mind being way off course, because i'm not the final verdict. this is just me discussing my morals, values, and ideas. maybe people agree, maybe others don't.
for instance, i saw a comment laughing because our justice system is about vengence, which i agree, but the user never displayed digust or displeasure with my ideas, just pointed out it actually is. and that's alright. to the others that seemed to agree with me, i wouldn't necessarily say we 100% agree, just that there are key points we both find important.
this in itself is important, because it  lets me know, it lets them know, that there are others out there with a similar mindset. One of the most important things, i think about living in a polarized society today, where everything seems to be going to shit, is to have somebody agree with you. that gives you hope. that lets you know that you're not fighting the good fight alone.
