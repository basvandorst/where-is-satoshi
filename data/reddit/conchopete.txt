You think 2 life sentences + 40 years is a proportionate sentence to "hosting a platform" where illegal activity was found to be occurring?   You can't say it is a fair and just sentence with a straight face.

Punishment is one thing.  But the punishment should fit the crime.  In this case it is grossly out of wack.

 When I got tired, I slept. When I got hungry, I ate. When I had to go x100 long on Bitmex, you know, I went.

From time to time the universe aligns perfectly as it should.  This is one of those moments.

I agree but imagine going back to 2009 and just mining your ass off.  You would be disgustingly rich today.  But yea I'll take 1 year for sure.

HAHAHAHA priceless.

Zuck looks like he is coming from the gym in this pic.  Do YOU usually wear an Armani suit and a Rolex when you work out?

Nothing wrong with that, my point was usually people aren't piling on the bling to go workout...BTW Citizen Eco-Drives are the best.  I have several.

Its just another node in addition to all the nodes that exists today around the world.  How is that not decentralized?
@_date: 2019-01-02 15:56:31
Every node controlled by (at least) 1 entity.  If you stand up a node in your house today, who would control it?  Most Likely you.

You ever hear of Google?  Its a crazy technology where you could search for stuff.  Put in "robbed for Bitcoin" in there and then I accept your apology for being so rude.     
@_date: 2018-04-18 00:14:37
I may just be over paranoid, but the last thing I would do is advertise to the public hey look at me I have a lot of Bitcoin.  That never ends well.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:47:04
Bitcoin is a bit different in that you are your own bank.  Many stories of known BTC holders getting robbed at gunpoint for their private keys.  And once its gone, its gone.  I get your point though.  The same could happen to a guy that flaunts a shiny rolex in the wrong place.  I don't disagree.

The point is you don't have to trust Satoshi.  Bitcoin protocol code is open source.

Being that you obviously did zero research on the topic (if you did you would've quickly found plenty of examples) and then accused me of parroting others without knowing a thing about me I thought it was pretty great.
