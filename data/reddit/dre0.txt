In fact there is no "ban" in Russia either. It's more like OK for trading, OK for p2p btc-altcoin exchange, jail for selling coffee for btc.

Hey Reddit, the MMM guys are already attacking Russian btc media in regards to this issue, some of them are here already. My advice is to ignore.
Being Russian i remember ealry 90's with all this going on. You can't even imagine the scales of MMM back then, idk maybe about 1/4 of population was scammed, no joke. 
What we see today is the Mavrodi-follower-scammers are creating the schemes using the country-famous "brand". 
The phenomenon here is that the MMM had Guinness-record ad campaign in every media back then, so huge that 20 years after there are plenty of 45+ y/o (let's just say naive) people who STILL belives in Mavrodi as their icon and their money returned and whatever. 
They are having a new campaighn online here now and even have their own 'Mavrocoin' continuing to scam not-so-smart people in ages and discrediting the Bitcoin itself.
Glad the Foundation reacted promptly.

They are not thieves

OP is Russian :) Won't sell, won't quit using. Bad thing is that doors for any btc business are closed, bad thing is we are becoming North Korea (not only for bitcoin).

Hey guys, russian here, just in case you need any info about situation we have here. 
Personally never used localbitcoins in fact, prefer btc-e or individual sellers.
Chart makes sense, RUR lost 7% in 3 days and the forecasts are far from optimistic.

Just in case, this is not a random news website, this is the largest government TV channel in the country 
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:34:44
"the government will be able to develop rules for the treatment of Bitcoin and other kriptovalyutami. He noted that, with the possible future of this tool." - gov-t will be able to develop rules for he treatment of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He noted that these tools may have good impact in future. ( just a small correction of g.translate)

So here is the page snapshop just in case they remove or modify the post 
By the way hope the community won't show aggression publicly, this could harm image of bitcoin i guess.

'Whole episode' is in fact one second frame with BTC logo. Good toon by the way, all eposides.

The guy I was speaking about, registered today to post here.
Good thing they are not so good in english, local blogs receive about 30 comments/hour :) 
@_date: 2014-11-28 12:45:49
Absolutely, everyone understands this here. Except mister P. maybe. 
@_date: 2014-09-19 18:18:34
Russian App Store next i guess
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:07:51
And one more source 
Main point from here: They postpone it till spring 2015 just to decide which prosecutions to apply for using btc, not to gather and estimate information. Russia ftw.

Member of Russian btc startup. Ending up in jail was not the plan. Sad news for local bitcoiners in fact, waiting for the TV to tell my mom her son is financing drug trafficking and terrorists.

When I need to enter PIN I have to make extra tap in digits field for the keyboard to appear. Why not to make it appear immediately like in blockchain wallet?

Um, let's just say our officials won't dig what nxt or whatever is. Funny thing is that this guy  invested in XAPO, i wonder if they fine him somehow lol. 
And regarding businesses, 3 or 4 months ago one of our largest electronics retailers said bitcoin was cool and they would integrate it immediately as soon as it's legit. After all these news they were like "nah, we won't, we didn't mean that".
