Upd. Network stats alpha version is up.

upd. FIAT currency converter has been implemented.

 Thanks for the question. Yep, I mean capacity. Also policies of the nodes, which are participating in this payment channel.

[ lightning network explorer (mainnet)

We do think of that, however there are a few things with higher priority  right now which we need to implement (based on user requests). 
@_date: 2018-10-25 19:45:20
Thanks. Just basic bootstrapping for now. Will look into custom design once core functionality is up and running.

I plan to add the funding transaction details, so you can check it right away on the bitcoin blockchain. I have not thought of launching the mainnet bitcoin block explorer, however bech32 support is worth studying. Will look into it, thanks.

Right now you can browse through the network, check current state of particular node or a channel, check how parameters of particular node changed over time. 
More features like wallet for example are on the roadmap.
Thanks for your suggestion as well, will look into it.

Thanks for a comprehensive overview, noted. Will follow up!
@_date: 2018-10-09 08:21:52
Thanks, noted. We are already working on setting up additional filters to have the possibility to check top nodes. If I understand you correctly: by "network fluidity" do you mean the best node to connect in terms of optimal payment route?

A few updates:  
\- pagination for big lists (especially on the history of node)  
\- night mode  
\- graphs for total amount of nodes and nodes state change: [ The nodes state change graph shows how many nodes were changing their state from active to inactive and vice versa
\- indication of node state: live/inactive
\- indication of channel state: active/closed
\- channel search  
\- sortings, 
[ 
[ 
besides the basic sorting for nodes you can now check the most uptime and downtime nodes  
Please  note that we have started to log the changes of node state in December,  so we don't know how long the older nodes have been online/offline  before that, so you will notice some discrepancy for older nodes. We  have not found a turnaround how to calculate that yet.
\-small improvements and bug fixes (also mentioned here on reddit)
@_date: 2019-02-19 14:20:35
\- new graphs added: live nodes, live channels, all time channels

Good one, thanks. Was also thinking about it.

Before we integrate this - what should we consider the channel opening time? Usually 6 confirmations are required before the channel is announced. While checking the channel funding tx ID you can see the time transaction was received and when it was actually included in the block (this interval may vary due to many factors: tx fee paid, network load etc.) So what do you define as channel opening time? Point when it was included in the block? Reached 6 confirmations? Would be thankful if you could elaborate on that.

Added nodes GEO stats: [

Thanks, all noted.
A few small things which have been done already:
\- typo has been corrected
\- the smallest channel value has been changed into satoshis
\- the smallest node stat is now showing the smallest node which has the capacity greater than 0
A lot of new data has been implemented into the stats page.
