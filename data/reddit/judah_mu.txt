Am I part of everyone?  I can certainly handle larger blocks without noticeable performance degredation (now, now, hold your horses, not GB blocks from the get-go). From what I understand many people have been moving off of Dial-up and AOL in recent years.
How much "more secure" is Bitcoin in 2015 compared to 2012 just because the world's bandwidth capacity has increased faster than max_blocksize has?  1% more secure? 50%?  
I mean, if we take your "Bitcoin's security relies on being able to spread new blocks quickly" by itself to its logical conclusion then blocks should be no more than 1kb, right?  Is that your official position?

I will full-RBF you back to Paypal.  Haha, you just got kicked further back in line.  Here's a People magazine while you wait.  
Perhaps you should start now researching how you might be able to use Lightning Network and Segregated Witnesses in the future when those finally become available so that you might be able to\* transfer monies in a much more complicated fashion, basically using a wrapper around how you used to transfer monies.  
That way I can continue running a global transfer system on my Motorola flip phone out on the African Sahara.
\*fine print: Space restriction in tiny blocks still apply, suckers.
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:58:41
Yeah, doesn't help much when the blocks  get over subscribed.  I've moved my cold storage coins to Coinbase because with tiny blocks they feel safer there.  At least they can be sold off chain when this project goes down the shitter.
Thanks, Blockstream.

If I want to be a "true bitcoiner" I have to run all the separate segwit signature stuff, right?  Comparing to  right now, if I want to be a true bitcoiner and accept payments properly, I run a node.  To keep the same level of security in the future I have to process all the separate segwit stuff, no?   
In the end no real difference then. If used to capacity I'll be consuming a lot more cycles and bandwidth just as if the block size increased.  Right?  
And all that fancy gluey code to put it all together.  Oodles and oodles of fancy code to write and test and document. Oh how fun.

I know some miners.  I am able to privately send them valid transactions to put into blocks without first broadcasting them.  Miners and their friends and acquaintances have always had this power to sidestep whatever whatever mempool broadcast whatever. Deal with it. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:03:00
Before blocks got full there was no fee market.  
Nobody paid fees.  
Keeping blocks small will force whatever tiny amount of transactions there are to pay high fees.  Those are totally, like, gonna be enough to secure the blockchain.  Yep, I'd buy that for a dollar.  $438 not so much.  
Edit: upon further reflection (thanks to commenters below) apparently Fees were being paid before this so-called "fee market" thingy magically came into existence!  what the hell are you talking about fee-market?

The Blockstream folks have been dutifully warning users that getting transactions into a block may take a long time and be costly.  I've taken the risk contained in those words to what I believe to be one possible logical conclusion and moved my cold storage coins to an exchange.

Bitcoin has a limit for Argentina as well:
Up to 1% of Argentinians can acquire goods necessary for living using the blockchain on any given day if and only if, at the same time, the other 7 billion people on the planet DO NOT write to the blockchain.  
If Argentinians paid their Utility bill in bitcoin and no other bitcoin commerce was conducted over the blockchain anywhere in the world, then up to 30% of Argentinians might get to keep their lights on.  Thankfully, Replace-by-fee will be useful in  managing scarcity in such a situation: The wealthiest (those most able to afford the fees to transact) will be able to pay their utilities.  
With this new-fangled segwit thingy in theory Bitcoin could offer Argentina nosebleed ~3.5% coverage rates if and only if nobody in the world but Argentinians write transactions.  
I think Argentina would be a nice place to visit but it seems kinda out-of-the-way hole-in-the-wallish.

Not ideal.  But if that's where the capacity is...  A man's gots to conduct hiz biznezz 2 earns hiz daily bread and you and I sure as fuck can't expect spare capacity will exist in Bitcoin's blocks at a cost that makes financial sense.  I mean, that's the whole reason for a fee market's existence, right?  We got's to manage that scarcity, yo.  
Oh yeah, if bitcoin is too costly and unpredictable a technology for me to actually conduct business with, that's like totally something I personally want to invest in!

A super-duper decentralized (a.k.a. expensive) Bitcoin Blockchain able to handle the writes of 5/1000th of 1% of the human population per day is not very interesting to me from a capital investment perspective.  You and whatever little group that remains interested  go on right ahead, though, we'll all get to watch and satisfy our curiosity interest.  Since all this stuff is open source the rest of us get to take the interesting parts and use them in different, perhaps smarter, ways.  
Decentralization is a very expensive tool that can be used to achieve a goal.  I think the goal you are seeking is an uncorrupted ledger?  OK, I want that too but if it is only available to a tiniest sliver of the population, meh, who cares?

Trying to get that magic number right now that is a one-time increase to satisfy all Bitcoin's future needs given unknown technological development seems naive to me, a fool's mission.

Good question.  From my own perspective, Coordinating banking connections for my changing list of international subcontractors was more expensive than just paying them all in bitcoin.  If Bitcoin is more expensive or more time consuming than it gets dropped like a stone, no questions asked.  As I am **not using Bitcoin as a get-rich-scheme**, if Bitcoin fails or not only affects me in comparison to how costly the next best competitor is.  That might be Litecoin or Paypal, whatever allows my business to run smoothly.

1. we've always known of Satoshi's stash.
2. were the gox coins stolen?  When? How much of it has been sold?
3. if the gox coins are lost (not stolen) then the remaining coins become more scarce.

If you are just buying a Happy Meal the merchant will budget in some 0.X % loss for the mythical double spends just as they already do for credit card fraud and counterfeit fiat bills.  If you are buying a house then waiting for confirmations probably is not unreasonable.

With all that AML processing and the trust needed that some entity holds the Bitcoin reserve, it seems much easier to just implement a Centralized voucher system rather than using an altcoin decentralized cryptocurrency.  Being fully pre-mined there is little incentive for using hardware and energy to secure the network... Better to just open up the company's ledger read-only to participants if a blockchain is important for RemitCoin.

Actually, a full node is not the most recommended way to access the Bitcoin network these days (unless one increases the number of connectable peers to not be a drain on the network).

It happens like this: Say Wall Street Journal comes out with a Bitcoin article.  Then every single one of these numb-nuts "new sources" has to write an article basically stating WSJ wrote a bitcoin article while quoting WSJ profusely, often verbatim. That's fine, who cares what they post on their own website.  The pathetic part is each of them posts their own version of the article to this subreddit when anything they actually add to the conversation would have fit nicely in a comment on the original WSJ discussion thread.

Well, the exchanges are "supposed" to be fully allocated.  Before you can place an ask for any BTC you need to send it to the exchange's keeping.  In the case of a run on the exchange, there "should" be no problem paying out everybody.

Yes, Bitcoins are stored directly in the phone using [Mycelium]( or [Bitcoin Wallet]( on Android.  Then, any internet connection works... I bet the gas station has wifi available.  I also understand Bitcoin Wallet for Android is experimenting with Bluetooth to broadcast transactions.

    Last attempt to share my conversation as it seems that my comment keeps getting deleted. Cheers
    FINAL UPDATE: Almost full conversation (the japanese Google Translate part didn't get record unfortunately):     www56.zippyshare.com/v/53067863/file.html - Please excuse the french accent and thank you MtGox!
    My initial reply was deleted, but I managed to get a hold of someone in english. Currently editing the audio to filter out my name.
    I like the second song. 9/10. Will live update with more impression.
    UPDATE: The song n°4 is good as well. 8/10. How many more did they plan?
    UPDATE: The song n°6 is very bad. A mix of sauna/8 bits song sped up. 2/10.
    UPDATE: The song n°7 is a minimalist piano song with an 1/2 beat on the background. Catchy. 6/10
    UPDATE: Back to the beginning. After listening to an 19 minute playlist elevator music, I feel relaxed and appeased.     Thank you MtGox. I will keep providing live updates.
    UPDATE: A live stream of this wonderful playlist - vocaroo.com/i/s0OLLaWes62C. Enjoy guys!
    UPDATE: The first song sounds even better the second time you hear it. The saxophone solo always gets to me. 8.5/10
    UPDATE: More information regarding the second song, reminds me of old Soviet Russia park music. 9 to 9.5/10!
    UPDATE: Missed the update on the third song. Skype's lag speed it up giving it a very nice random effect. The songs live and evolve with you! A bit too simple for my taste though, 4/10.
    UPDATE: The complete list (of the 4 first songs, you can complete the playlist with the link above): vocaroo.com/i/s1mCzndZH7sR - Enjoy!
    UPDATE: The soothing sentiment is disappearing as song n°6 started. Reduced to 2/10.
    UPDATE: In the eventuality the operators do not speak english, I will be using Google Translate voice bot to talk directly to the operator in japanese.
    UPDATE: Despite having prepared translate.google.fr/ and     translate.google.fr/ and using the bot, a very nice lady replied to my call in english. Some personal information were shared so bear with me while I filter my name out.

Spending from an SPV wallet broadcasts the transaction the same as a full node does.  No real difference or centralization involved.

Yes, Bitcoin has been extremely volatile since it started at $0 five years ago.  Someday the volatility may decrease to "acceptable" levels...  These days merchants that accept Bitcoin typically convert to fiat currency immediately to avoid volatility risk.

A private key is a number.  One cannot prove that a number doesn't exist.  However we generally agree that some addresses are too off-the-wall for anybody to actually have the private key for it.  This is kinda the same concept that protects all of our funds...  
Basically talked about in this infographic: 
So for addresses like [1CounterpartyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXUWLpVr]( and [1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE]( we all just agree that nobody would have the private key to those addresses.  (The last 5 digits of an address must be a correct hash of everything that comes before it or gets rejected by the network).   
On a related note is something like [vanitygen]( where you can keep cranking out private keys until you find the associated address that looks good for you.  For instance, creating 1BTC followed by random characters might take 30 seconds, depending on the speed of your computer, and 1judah...... might take 30 minutes.

There are a plethora of sites now that publish and republish bitcoin stories.  It is hard to determine which source broke the news first.  Sometimes Coindesk does, sometimes they don't.
A worse case is when Reuters publishes a bitcoin story.  We get the UK reuters version, the Australian version, the Canadian version, etc., all the same content.
It is very difficult for mods to hold in their mind everything that has been posted in order to cross reference and weed out duplicates, although we try to a certain extent.
We are interested in objective, usable suggestions on how to improve matters.  "Just spend moar time at it" is a popular suggestion but not very usable.
We obviously rely heavily on the community voting mechanism here to determine which content makes it to the front page(s) although that method is sloppy for some of the same reasons.

Hard to say.  If long time hoarders start buying goods, it is as if they are cashing out (some).

It's not exactly easy to time 2 transactions to propagate across the network such that 1 TX reaches the merchant but later gets discarded while the other TX reaches the miners and gets included in the next block. 
 It "could" happen and it is up to merchants to judge/budget the risks. In theory, at least, the merchant is saving on credit card fees and chargebacks..

Well, if every bitcoin gets mined that leaves about 0.003 bitcoins per person, a house might be 0.003 BTC.  On the other hand the first exchange of goods for Bitcoin was 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins.  Somewhere between there I'd have to establish my salary.  I'd have to establish how much goods and services I can get in exchange for my labor as denominated in BTC.  Which is intricately related to how much demand there is in the world for BTC.  This demand currently fluctuates more than other currencies and calculating based on the exchange rate of bitcoin to dollars is the simplest, easiest way to gauge current demand/purchase power of bitcoin.

If Satoshi's wealth is a problem for market participants, they can choose to not use Bitcoin.  They have the option, as market participants, to use a different cryptocurrency (with a different wealth distribution) or not use cryptocurrency at all.  We'll just have to see how it all plays out and each of us affects the outcome in some small  way.
I'm thinking that when Bitcoin reaches market saturation Satoshi might unload a good portion of his bitcoins to a kick-ass charity of some sort, the likes of which hasn't even been imagined yet.

I do not think merchants will want to implement hundreds of wallets, managing exchange rates and very long drop-down menus to satisfy whatever crypto is flavor-of-the month.  They will want to implement only the currencies that have the widest customer base and keep their sites fairly clean and non-confusing.   An individual purchasing crypto-currency "should" purchase only those currencies that seem to have lasting re-sale value -- for instance, widest user base and merchant acceptance.

Think of Bitcoin like digital cash.  If a person is paying cash (or even PayPal) for a car, how does that person know the vehicle is actually owned by the seller?  The car's title or a house deed still needs to be processed by the appropriate Government office.

Miners only work on transactions they can see.  Nodes (not necessarily miners) only share transactions that they see as valid (i.e., not double spends).  If a transactions has made it across the network (and into the mining pools), a second transaction won't get past the initial set of peers it is broadcast to.

Coinbase gives you addresses that only you receive funds on.  Coinbase controls the private keys to those addresses and usually moves the coins to other hot wallets and cold storage.
The term "Your private key" does not really apply to Coinbase.  They give you a public address and watch for funds received on that address for you.

Faster harddrive, perhaps.  
I believe it checks the key against every transaction since the start of the blockchain in case there are transactions that happened previously with that key.
On a different client, like multibit, you can set a "catch up" time to the present time if it is indeed a brand new private key.  Maybe something like that is available on the satoshi client but I don't know offhand.

It seems this attack would be much more effective in collusion with miners.
My understanding is this: Attacker intercepts a broadcasted TX as it is racing across the network.  Attacker then mutates it and re-broadcasts it while being rejected by every node that saw the original.  However, if the attacker simply sends the mutated TX to a work pool and the miner simply replaces the original with mutated one...
Any statistics available where mutated TXs are found in higher frequency in any particular miner's solved blocks?

Bitcoins are divisible.  Actually what is referred to as a Bitcoin is arbitrary.  At the the network level what are commonly called "satoshis" are used.  A satoshi is a 100 millionth of a bitcoin.
For reference, dividing the world population by 21 million yields 0.003 BTC per person.
I'll send you a tiny fraction of a bitcoin but that equates to millions of "satoshis"...

Thus the mantra: "Only invest what you can afford to lose."  The average Joe Schmoo probably should just continue living paycheck to paycheck while he still has faith in his overlords.  
But it just might be possible that the volatility is a temporary phenomenon related to price discovery of a completely new asset class.  Stability may come in the future because, as you say, "crypto-currencies present an incredible opportunity."

Money is an abstract concept.  Societies and groups over time have bestowed the the label "money" onto various commodities.  Looking at this history a pattern has emerged as to what types of things come to be used as money.  
For most of recorded history an intangible item that was scarce, fungible, divisible, transportable, recognizable and durable was inconceivable.  With Bitcoin such a thing has been created and traditional monetary theory will have to come to grips with it.  Basically we are engineering a new form of money rather than having it organically establish itself through the barter process.

Cryptocurrency implies a decentralized ledger with (usually) proof-of-work to protect updates to that ledger from false transactions.  What incentive would miners have to expend resources protecting such a currency?  A centralized ledger is basically what PayPal and Visa work with already, transferring virtual dollars from the customer to your merchant account until such time that they send digital dollars to your bank.

I am mostly concerned with the fate of the coins.  If Karpeles "sold" them at $100 or even today I am not "worried" (I know that sounds like a poor way to put it). But down the road this can have immense impact as you alluded in the article: 


So Karpeles could have sold customer's coins as his own early May 2013 and buyers could have transferred them out or left them on Gox.  The original customers who deposited the coins would have no actual coin-backing at that point and no fiat as it was Karpeles who was selling, but Gox continued business as normal.

Spending BTC with an [SPV]( wallet exposes you to no additional risk.   If you are receiving funds you have to trust that the nodes you are connected to are not feeding you bogus information.

First of all, if their wealth is in Bitcoin and they damage Bitcoin's reputation too badly, they also destroy their wealth.  Apart from that, not a whole lot is stopping them.  Bitcoin is unregulated and, as such, people can do with their private property as they see fit.  Of course this state of affairs keeps many investors away, so be it.

A. Since the Court issued an order under which the Company is prohibited from making certain
payments, establishing security over its assets, and disposing of its assets, etc., refunding the bitcoins
or cash is legally prohibited.
In addition, if the bankruptcy proceedings commence, such
prohibition will continue pursuant to the Bankruptcy Law in Japan. With regard to the distribution
under the bankruptcy proceedings, please see below.


If the bankruptcy proceedings commence, will there be any distribution to the creditors? How
will such distribution be conducted?  
A. It is not possible to respond to these questions at this stage. If the bankruptcy proceedings
commence, the bankruptcy trustee will decide these matters upon consultation with the Court.

Different wallets handle change differently.  Some will send the change back to the original address, other wallets create a new change address and send it there.
In the first case, no problem (but you can lose privacy - which is another topic).
In the second case you have to make sure your wallet software keeps the private key to the change address it created.

I always expected Colored Coin -type arrangements for USD, gold, oil, etc to be developed to ride on top of the Bitcoin protocol.  Not a big problem here, if the market has a demand for something like this, go for it.  Any gold-backed currency, for instance, is only as strong as the centralized party offering the backing.  But bitcoin provides an ideal way to transfer the rights to those claims between parties.

1.) in Ubuntu your wallet is  
    ~/.bitcoin/wallet.dat  
Your private keys are inside that file (hopefully encrypted with a password).
If you have to restore your wallet.dat file, replace any existing wallet.dat file with the backup (as long as the existing .dat file has no funds)
2.) To sell bitcoin on an exchange, register an account with them and send bitcoins to the address the exchange provides for you.
3.) a private key a 256 bit number used to sign transactions that spend bitcoins from your account using [public-key cryptography](
4.) These would be so-called physical bitcoins.  Unless you are going to buy physical bitcoins, I wouldn't worry about it much.
5.) There is practically no reason you'd want to generate a QR code for a private key from a wallet.dat file.

They don't have unlimited supply at any given price point.  Just like on an exchange...  If you are buying 100 BTC you'll probably eat up the ask stack some and pay more for each BTC than if you buy just 1 BTC from the lowest offer.

It depends on how you encode cards into binary without losing entropy.  Simplest case: Red/Black = 0/1, you'll need 256 cards.  Using standard decks you'll be guaranteed to have an equal number of 0s and 1s, which is itself a (slight) loss of entropy.

Yes, that is fine.  It is adding a centralized layer on top of a decentralized payment network.  For small amounts it won't be the end of the world if the centralized service goes tits up (a la Gox).

Yeah, I've been getting my salary 100% in bitcoin for over a year.  My salary does track the exchange rate, however, so this week's paycheck will have more bitcoins in it than last week's.  I do own some of the bitcoins I earned at $100 exchange rate and I still own some of the $1000 ones as well.  C'est la vie, my overall cost basis is around $500.  If I was concerned about something like this week actually occuring, I wouldn't choose to receive my salary in Bitcoin.  Actually, I would because I work internationally and Bitcoin kicks ass as for speed, security and discretion compared to alternatives but I would convert to local currencies immediately.  But I'm not so concerned.

@_date: 2014-01-05 05:41:05
No.  BTC is private money.  You can only track what is publicly recorded.  Perhaps Localbitcoins.com can yield you some bulk information.
@_date: 2014-04-21 02:02:23


@_date: 2014-03-08 10:45:21
1. This isn't cex/ghash customer support.  Just as this isn't Coinbase, Bitstamp, MtGox, etc. customer support
1. A little sensational conclusion just because a withdrawal doesn't go through.  Sucks, but hot wallets often get depleted and it takes a while before funds transferred from a cold wallet can be sent out again.  It's the weekend, maybe the folks running the site are out partying.

Well, the latest block(s) can be replaced, both as the normal working of the network and as part of an attack.  6 blocks is recommended because replacing all 6 is thought to be too difficult.  Some services use more confirmations, some use less or none.  It depends on risk factors.  The risk and financial impact of receiving a double-spend for a cup of soup is so low that many merchant will accept zero-confirmation for convenience.  If making a very large purchase, waiting an hour might be appropriate.

The bitcoin addresses A and B that get stored in the blockchain can be created anonymously and randomly by anybody.  In practice, however, data often gets associated with bitcoin transactions apart from the blockchain.  For instance, bank accounts while purchasing bitcoins (sent to address A)  and shipping addresses (for goods bought from address B), etc.

Anybody know if the BitcoinJ family of wallets (Multibit, Bitcoin Wallet for Android) handles this attack elegantly?
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:40:26
Haha, yep.  Typically a paper wallet has all the satoshis in 1 big chunk.  To pay out 0.5btc it has to split the total, send 0.5 to somebody and send the remainder back to the original address or a new address (depending on the software used). In the first case the address of the paper wallet will still contain the coins but it is not a paper wallet anymore (having been spent on the network). In the second case the balance is on a new address and the paper wallet balance is empty.

Gold's divisibility is problematic for small amounts.  Bitcoin is divisible to 8 decimal places.  No need for a "silver" altcoin, the analogy does not apply... Only if miners' fees become problematic for micro-payments would an altcoin have utility in this regard, but miners' fees are decreasing.

It is all rather new.  Coinbase should expect competition in their U.S. market soon if they keep fees so high.  Then, of course, there is a customer segment that bought BTC at sub $250 that Overstock may be targeting...
If Bitcoin doesn't become competitive in the payments arena, surprise surprise, it will go away from the payments arena.  That's how free markets are supposed to work. Bitcoin could still carry on as a store of wealth.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:13:26
Hi Jimmy, welcome to &gt;maybe it is coinbase moving it into cold storage  
Yes, Coinbase handles many BTC and usually keeps account balances separate from actual Blockchain events.  No need to worry.  If you had the BTC on your own computer (using [Multibit]( for example), it would stay put until you move it.

What happens when the "useful" proof of work gets solved?  
Everybody auto-magically switches to some other problem that can be measurably broken up into 10 minute work units?  How does that process work?  That describes a very complicated setup of rules and agreements between miners that perhaps we are not technically ready for yet.
Bitcoin was/is experimental and technically ground breaking enough for the time being ;)
Everybody is free to use their computing power to do whatever they wish.  Most miners wish mainly for personal financial reward, not necessarily to save mankind.

Nothing technical, Bitcoin is just concerned with the protocol and doesn't have a magic wand to change the behavior of other entities. Was Mt.Gox running a fractional reserve?
Note, taking delivery of Bitcoin is easy and more straightforward than building additional infrastructure around Bitcoin promissory notes.  Also, proving bitcoin reserves is trivial by signing for the addresses and checking with the blockchain.

They use an in-house payment processor for domestic USD orders (and now bitcoin).   They use a 3rd-party processor for international orders.  This offloads the trouble of dealing with various foreign currencies and (also) language/legal interaction with foreigners.

For security purposes web servers and **private keys** should rarely meet.  You can generate a list of private/public key pairs off the server and upload just the public keys to the server.
There are tools for various programming languages to generate keys.  In Java I use the BitcoinJ or Supernode libraries.
Getting more advanced, you can generate public keys on the server in realtime using [Hierarchical Deterministic Keys](

I am curious what language would be used to "ban" bitcoin.  
1. It is not a currency, rather it is a distributed ledger.  
They won't ban numbers will will they? -- private keys.  
You shall not hash SHA-256.
2. The purchaser transmits funds by signing a message regarding ledger entries and placing it on the network. The seller has no way to block funds transferring to an address under his control.  
All the while allowing gifts, IOUs, and barter to remain legal (i.e., transfer of chickens for goods and services).

Aye, new users are basically recommended to get a light wallet.  A full blockchain lets you verify incoming coins all the way back to when they were mined.  With a light client you sort of trust that transactions (especially ones sent to your wallet!) are verified by other nodes along the way. Basically.  Also there is a torrent file to greatly increase downloading the blockchain speed.

Miners effectively sell blockspace.  
Decreasing demand for blockspace is the goal.  
No, the goal is not "bloating a network that many people rely on for its freedom and **security** [emphasis mine]".  
Decreasing demand for blockspace is the result.  
Security and "bloat" seem to be working at cross-currents.

If the fear ain't there then why are we consuming phenomenal amounts of resources on decentralization?  I just don't get it!  Fear of other hackers corrupting the blockchain?

@_date: 2015-09-29 21:37:44
One criticism of BIP 100 is that it allows miners to sell their votes.  I am starting to think that is a valuable feature of BIP 100.  
In order to sell a vote a miner has to out compete other miners.  In order to stay competitive miners will have to plow most of that money back into their hash rate.  That is good for bitcoin.  Pools that abuse this privilege "should" see their hashrate decrease similar to when GHASH.io went into serious decline.  For those wanting to buy votes, it comes at a real cost to them and 20% of votes on the high and low end are discarded anyways.
@_date: 2015-09-28 14:26:00

$20 per TX * ~2500 TX per block = $50,000 per block.

Assuming all your assumptions come true.  
By the way I would say $20 fees would qualify as 


But hey, we got past that, right?

I am hoping to get yet another order of magnitude of security.  Tiny blocks with $200 fees?

@_date: 2015-09-29 22:39:16
Yes, I can see that.  But life is unpredictable.  We don't know if general bandwidth, etc., will keep improving.  Miners can monitor all of that in real time and act accordingly.  
I think block size should also follow demand somewhat.  If blocks are inherently too large and fee revenue is slipping, then hash rate will slip and security will decrease.  I think it is an important tool that miners can collectively squeeze blocks smaller if it comes to that.

Certainly seems like a trifling detail to me, but if there's a definition somewhere then, ipso facto, it must be the truth. 
You completely validate from the genesis block but there is no artifact left afterwards that shows that work was performed except the UTXO set.  Which is identical to the UTXO set in the snapshot node (in a non-attack scenario).

In order to criticize Hearn for saying the remaining users will be criminals, you have to disagree with his assumption that legitimate business will choose cheaper options if faced with High fees.  
It is perfectly fine to disagree with that assumption.  In fact I believe you do.  But you can't criticize a later point if you disagree with the previous points that lead up to it.  By definition **IF** non-criminal users leave Bitcoin for whatever reason, all that is left are criminals.  That is not controversial at all.

Relevant [quote from Gavin](


do something crazy that would either destroy Bitcoin or would be completely
unacceptable to you, personally... then maybe you should look for some
other system that you might trust more, because Bitcoin's basic security
assumption is that a supermajority of miners are 'honest.'  
Seriously, I hear nothing but pessimism from core devs about "the mining situation."  Is bitcoin fatally flawed? Should we take Gavin's advice?
@_date: 2015-09-30 05:29:02

The number of block confirmations (0 to whatever) should be agreed on before the sale is initiated.  
Having been caught with your pants down, a general rule of thumb is 6 confirmations (about 1 hour).
In my personal experience, my buyers have never asked for more than 2 confirmations.

Some have predicted that as soon as the next halving some miners will stop flowing electricity through their machines until enough fees pile up in the mempool.  Does any of your analysis show that happening?  When the minting reward is considerably less than the fees in the previous block, isn't it smarter to attempt to orphan the previous block and capture those fees?
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:52:45
Language issues, I guess.  
I read "directly favors" as in prioritizes, maximalizes.  
So nullc is saying there there are one or more elements, each directly favoring something but that particular something they are favoring is never decentralization? 
What would a proposal that directly favors decentralization look like?  
Using his language: The proposed 2MB hard fork does not favor decentralization as much as 1MB does, neither directly nor indirectly.

Miner income is what provides security to the network.  We want people to want to mine bitcoin.  Without security our scalability efforts will be useless.  BIP100 gives miners a tool to maximize income in response to dynamic variables such as average fees, demand for blockspace (average transactions per second), etc.  Competition is "supposed" to push most of miner income towards mining.
We as a community are allowed to choose/force capacity increases even if at the expense of security, but I don't think that is the smart way to go.

Aye, some people think it is great if whatever is used as money also has some sort of "backup plan" i.e., other uses.  This is not technically necessary.  Money's best use is as money. A great thing about Bitcoin is it's use is voluntary.  If somebody doesn't like it, they don't have to use it (well, until it becomes ubiquitous...).

Yeah, Coinbase expects you to handle name, mailing address, etc., on your end.  They don't want to deal with all that stuff, unlike PayPal.  Please note: perhaps your customers don't want their name and address being sent to a 3rd party like Coinbase either. Coinbase will link 1 [custom] field like an order ID to  the Payment button. It is possible to stuff all the information you need in the [custom] field, but that still needs some setup on your end as well as a callback.

The tip bot just creates one for you on-the-fly. It then associates probably your username or some other unique identifier with that wallet so it can find it again when needed.  I think I saw the bitcointip bot code was released as open source somewhere, too lazy at the moment to go look at it...

A "wallet" is a collection of keys.  It is implementation specific and the content is not public knowledge.  Your idea would be focussed on specific addresses.  Addresses, keys, and wallets are costless to create.  While some people, such as [Wikileaks]( reuse the same address, this is not recommended for most users because of privacy and/or security.

[Bitcoin wiki - Merchant How-to]( offers 2 suggestions: Pre-generate addresses or use a 3rd-party provider.  Both have good and bad points.  Pre-generating addresses requires some technical skills (uploading for use on the web server, for one) and requires juggling private keys for each address generated. 3rd party costs you fees and privacy and requires you to trust them to a certain extent.  
I am working on a 3rd option utilizing [Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets]( but it is no where near prime-time yet (mainly due to a lack of funds - a man's gotta eat).  I am keeping a record of posts like yours to submit along with a request for a Bitcoin grant.

Because during the time employers are holding back, people aren't getting paid.  When people aren't paid, they tend to buy less goods and services.  Lower demand for goods and services causes employers to pull back even more, creating a deflationary spiral.

When bitcoin value goes up, the theory goes that demand for mining rigs goes up as well. If that demand is met by increased supply, then each individual rig will be pulling fewer and fewer coins.  It seems their unit cost should decrease in terms of bitcoins as total supply (hashpower) increases.  But remember, behind the scenes we are assuming the value of bitcoin is increasing in dollar terms.

Growing pains.  Let the market work this out and you can do as you wish as a market participant.  If bitcoin is hard for you to replace then I would consider just holding them.  If you can immediatly replace with fiat what you spend with BTC, go that route.
BTC has to increase much, much more to be a viable worldwide currency.  Consider that multiple, large business-to-business transaction needs to be happening simultaneously, much of it in escrow, along with all the personal transactions, AND personal savings.  We have a long ways to go.

1. There are delays moving fiat currency out of Mt.Gox for many people, the price reflects that delay.  
2. The address is the public portion, while the private key portion is usually handled behind the scenes by your wallet software.  To move coins to another wallet, you usually "spend" the coins to the new address created by the other wallet.  
@_date: 2013-09-30 02:24:16
It is a bit complicated, isn't it.  For refunds, the sending address may be a one-time use address and is not expecting bitcoin sent back to it.  For payments below what is expected, in the bitcoin merchant space you don't always have a reliable contact such as an email address.  Both cases point towards moar coding needed ;)

Each block mined gives a 25BTC reward which is added to the existing supply.  There will be more coins in existence in 2014 than there were in 2013.  So the inflation *rate* goes down while the amount of coins steadily increases.  In 2017 the reward is halved to 12.5 BTC per block.

It appears that Coinbase fills some current niche in the Supply and Demand of Bitcoin services. My feeling is that unless bitcoin adds a layer or two of abstraction to make it easier for the masses it will be relegated to enthusiasts and criminals.  To me using bitcoin is like owning my own bank branch, with all the benefits and responsibilities (managing my own keys and security) that entails.  The general public probably won't take it up if it is more complicated than using a credit card or twitter.

It seems to me the two are linked.  Once I napkin'd that if Bitcoin were to handle 1% of gross global trade (not figuring for velocity) then each coin would be upwards of $1 million.  If Bitcoin gets into more hands and is used for purchases more, then the price has to rise. Or else people aren't saving them at all, just spending them practically as soon as they get them (high velocity).

It requires a 3rd party. Bitcoin itself doesn't have the capability to "convert" itself into anything else such as local currencies.  You or the seller will have to find a business or individual that wants to buy your bitcoins using the local currency.  The tricky part is finding a 3rd party that won't scam y'all whilst keeping within whatever anonymity parameters you require.

If the pizza guy and plumber accept (and posses some amount of) bitcoin, and there's only 12 million bitcoins to go around, the price of each bitcoin would necessarily have to increase *significantly*.  At that time a 5% - 10% change in the price of 1 BTC, when translated into the mBtc or μBTC range of (future) day-to-day transactions, becomes almost unnoticeable.  
There is kind of a catch-22 at work here. To get more people to use it, the volatility needs to decrease. But to decrease the volatility, more people need to use it.  I am hoping that that people realize bitcoin offers other benefits so that adoption increases despite current volatility.
I don't see "standardized" pricing in bitcoin becoming a reality until the value of each bitcoin is greater than, say, $50,000 or so. Consider, a "fair share" of bitcoin is 0.003, or 21 million BTC divided among 7 billion people. Yesterday I did a job for 1.5 BTC, i.e., the "fair shares" of 500 people.  If the value really goes to $50,000 then something exciting is happening and it could very easily go to $1 million or more.

 Testnet3 is the current test network.  I'm not sure if you have to do  "bitcoind -testnet3", or just "bitcoind" with testnet=3 in the config file...
Another problem is not many people are running TestNet3 nodes.  I am using [BitcoinJ](code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/) and wasn't getting any peers starting from localhost. In bitcoinJ I was able to seed my Peer discovery to use seed.bitcoin.sipa.be:18333 and testnet-seed.bitcoin.petertodd.org.   I'm not sure how to do that in bitcoinD
I'm no expert, just learning....
PS... PM me an address and I can send you some TestNet3 coins

While I appreciate BitPay bringing bitcoin to the masses (of merchants, as it were) I think such centralization is starting to run counter to bitcoin goals. BitPay gets to track which companies are booming, which are floundering, who they all bank with. BitPay service can go offline, then what do you do?  Also possible BitPay could freeze accounts, or...

I think its only intrinsic value is as a "virtual scarce good" in that there will only be 21 million created. This is rather unique in the digital realm where copying data is almost ubiquitous.  This can lend some "collector item" value to bitcoin but I do not think it would amount to very much.  I think Colored coins are a separate issue even though they require the Bitcoin protocol underneath.

I'm working in this area.  I'm getting a proposal and design together but here's a brief blurb... what do you think?  I will definitely look at OpenBravoPOS api to see if any integration can be accomplished even early in the design phase.
**Tired of generating lists of addresses for your high traffic Bitcoin website while juggling their private keys?  Not feeling comfortable sharing your money and transaction details with a centralized 3rd party payment processor?  *BitCashier* leverages the power of hierarchical deterministic wallets to simplify your payment gateway needs.**
**Brief overview**  
The proposal is to implement [BIP 32]( as a payment gateway.  It offers merchants a simple and secure way to create addresses, link addresses to orders, and receive notifications when payments have been received.  The merchant can be assured the web server or point-of-sale device never handles private keys. Therefore, if the web server is compromised or a sales clerk attempts to steal them, no private keys can be revealed.  The prevalence of secure and easy to use merchant tools promotes Bitcoin as a whole.

Yes it is very volatile at the moment.  It is still in it's infancy. If/when BTC is priced a couple factors higher, any volatility will be difficult to notice in the milliBit and microBit range where you and I will be doing our transactions.  
Since bitcoin is already electronic in nature, I have found most merchants just derive a BTC price from the current exchange rate for the local currency at the Point of Sale.  These merchants have strategies to mitigate the exchange risk, often exchanging much of the sales to local currency immediately.

A group of private keys is what has become known as a "Bitcoin Wallet".  Those private keys are what allow you to spend your bitcoins.  On hosted wallets such as Coinbase, they will handle the private keys behind the scenes for you.  If you run a Bitcoin client on your own computer (recommended) it is important to have a backup copy of your wallet file in a safe place (separate hard drive) in case your main wallet gets lost or corrupted.

On coinbase,  Transactions --&gt; Send Money, is how you send bitcoins to an arbitrary address.
You don't need a public key.  If you want to recieve bitcoins on your coinbase "wallet" ...


Or a quick way is to go to Transaction --&gt; Request Money, leave all the fields blank and click the Request Money button.

This is a statement of fact to me, I don't read much bias into it.

But for the purpose of this post, I think just putting an bitcoin address to a secure or temporary wallet on any joomla site is better than building a wallet in php that runs on a joomla server.

When Android was shown to have a flawed SecureRandom seed, I believe more than 1 transactions from the same private/public key was enough to hash back to the private key in a reasonable amount of time. A new change address forces your client to generate a new private key that has never been seen on the network.  Other than that, using blockchain analysis its not readily apparent which output is the change address and which is the target spend, adding 1 more step for pseudo-anonymity's sake.

It would make the system more complicated.  Right now the fee is whatever is left over when the payment(s) is subtracted from the inputs.  Your idea would create another step where the receiver has to  decide the fee ... before it is added to the blockchain or after? Which miner receives the fee? Often the receiver won't be immediately available to do that.

by sent/submitted you mean broadcast to 1 or more peers?
Different Transactions spending the same outputs (coins) can be sent/submitted. A peer, when receiving multiple transactions with the same output, is supposed to reject the second transactions and just use the first.
So the "good" transaction and the "bad (double-spend)" transaction are fighting for peer coverage.
The transaction that is with the miner who solves the next block becomes the official transaction.

The job I did yesterday for 1.5 BTC would be worth $183 if I sold on MtGox right now but $5 million if bitcoin were globally adopted. Objectively, I was paid 500 people's *fair shares* of bitcoin.
Bitcoin's value is tied to a well-known fixed supply vs. a confounding demand. Besides what a bitcoin can be exchanged for *right now* one has to consider what it could be exchanged for in the future. To the moon if accepted, virtually nil if not. Hedge accordingly.

Would be nice to see [BitCasher]( created. The basic concept is a decentralized DIY payment processor for merchants.  Depending on Bitpay and Coinbase market share, Coinvalidation could save money just focusing their efforts on those 2 companies.  Also, if those companies get shut down by the authorities, a large part of the bitcoin economy will grind to a halt.  BitCashier strives to avoid these issues but there is no obvious revenue stream to support investing in its creation.  It could be a flagship project that lends brand recognition and drives traffic to a company website, however.

[Bitcoin wiki - Merchant How-to]( offers 2 suggestions: Pre-generate addresses or use a 3rd-party provider.  Both have good and bad points.  Pre-generating addresses requires some technical skills (uploading for use on the web server, for one) and requires juggling private keys for each address generated. 3rd party costs you fees and privacy and requires you to trust them to a certain extent.  
I am working on a 3rd option utilizing [Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets]( but it is no where near prime-time yet (mainly due to a lack of funds - a man's gotta eat).  I am keeping a record of posts like yours to submit along with a request for a Bitcoin grant.

Intriguing question that sparked some ideas for me:
As mentioned, Utah legalizing gold and silver as legal tender sets a precedent.  Maybe examine how the [local currency of Ithaca]( New York is working out.  When you say 'accept' you mean as payment for taxes?  One route is to strip the dollar-based public services expenditure of the city to the bone.  Case in point: [Fire Dept watch house burn over $75 fee](  Then have a more robust but voluntary public service system based in BTC.  Cities usually have a say in the types and location of  businesses within their jurisdiction, for instance, no strip clubs next to schools.  Seems that a covenant directing businesses within the city limits to accept Bitcoin for transactions is not unthinkable.
Can a business legally pay it's workers in Bitcoin? Probably not, but there are cases of top executives symbolically taking $1 as a yearly salary.  Perhaps you could use that and make side deals with your employees?  But be careful of this case: Robert Kahre paid his "contract" workers the face value of gold and silver coinage, [got sent to prison](

Certainly it will be available for online merchants. As I'm sure you are aware, there is no single one-click solution that can satisfy every online environment without a 3rd party intermediary.  The plan is to get the core functionality down pat, then building bridges to the most popular web frameworks/environments to make the experience as easy and non-technical as possible for merchants.
I played around with some designs that do not require a datastore. However, I believe some form of persistence is necessary to perform the goals of the project (particularly in synchronizing front end sales with the back office).  In my view this presents the first technical hurdle.  The second is that, at least initially, the library will be coded in Java. Perhaps only a minority of web servers have java available but the same can probably be said about Python. Not running a full node is a design constraint and I'm not aware of any PHP implementations that can run the bitcoin protocol in SPV mode. If they exist, that would probably be the best option but would leave Android and most tablets out in the cold.  
So yes, many considerations need to be hashed out.  The thing is my kids can't eat considerations or open source libraries no matter how much effort is put into them. So I'm here to gauge/drum up interest in the project before taking it any further.  Feedback has been mostly positive but shares an annoying characteristic with considerations and open source code in that it also cannot be eaten.  I expect customers can continue to look forward to having many of their bitcoin purchases tracked (IP address, bitcoin address, purchase amounts and frequency) by our Trusted Third Party overlords.

What language are you programming in?  There are a lot of native libraries that implement the Bitcoin protocol -- no need to go the json-rpc route.  I'm into Java and have had much luck using BitcoinJ.
Some libraries are coming out with  hierarchical determinstic wallets [BIP 32]( now which sound like what you'd want to use.  Generate public-key only keys on the server as needed and generate the private keys separately on a secure machine.   I am currently working on a payment gateway for Java based on BIP 32.

As far as the price: I get paid weekly a fixed fiat amount translated into Bitcoin.  I personally expect the price to eventually go higher (probably much much higher) but the higher it is right now, the fewer coins I receive each week.  I could slam all my fiat into Bitcoin on the next dip but I'm actually keeping a 50/50 break between fiat and BTC, just trying to build up gradually.

Side note: the supply of Bitcoin is inflating 13% this year.  Much higher than fiat inflation rates in developed countries. (Edit: not true of supply, I was thinking CPI) The supply will continue to inflate until there are no more block rewards.
In the case of deflation: If a new car costs 10 BTC this month but next month it will cost 9 BTC, the month after 8.25 BTC and so on, I will be very tempted to put off purchasing that new car for some time.

Sure, a private key is a 256 bit number.  The representation you often see has been encoded into HEX or some other format.

Mining rig pricing in terms of bitcoin is an intriguing topic, kind of an edge case when discussing fiat vs bitcoin pricing. There is a theory that hashrate is tied to bitcoin's value.
I guess the proof is in the pudding, meaning that if a company can succeed using a fixed BTC to Unit business model in a particular market, then that's all we need to know...

[Bitcoin wiki - Merchant How-to]( offers 2 suggestions: Pre-generate addresses or use a 3rd-party provider.  Both have good and bad points.  Pre-generating addresses requires some technical skills (uploading for use on the web server, for one) and requires juggling private keys for each address generated. 3rd party costs you fees and privacy and requires you to trust them to a certain extent.  
I am working on a 3rd option utilizing [Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets]( but it is no where near prime-time yet (mainly due to a lack of funds - a man's gotta eat).  I am keeping a record of posts like yours to submit along with a request for a Bitcoin grant.

Alright, there are currently 12 million coins and that will eventually grow to 21 million.  Sure, they can be divided to very precise amounts.  But it doesn't change the total amount of coins.  Say a BTC is worth $1,000. I can split it into a hundred pieces and give $10 worth to all of my friends.  This doesn't change the overall amount of BTC or overall value.

Your question has intrigued me.  First off, everything has risk.  As an investment, Bitcoin has been the best performing asset YOY for the past 2 years.  It was risky but has paid off.
USD in a Bank has risk, too.  Personally, I believe it has high risk.  USD is backed by the US Gov't whose finances are a complete mess.  I don't see any path for the gov't to get out of that mess using traditional means.  This tells me that extraordinary measures are in the future.  Someday the world is going to say "yeah, we have enough US Treasuries for now, thanks."  And then what happens?  I'm not confident the FDIC can make deposits whole in the next crisis. And if they are paid 100 cents on the $1, I don't think those dollars will be worth much at that point anyways.
Bitcoin has only been around a few years. It can't magically appear in all the shops you frequent just like credit cards where around for decades before they got much retail penetration.  I remember when I used to write personal checks in restaurants and stores but that just isn't done anymore. Perhaps if you talked to the store owners you'll find that they haven't heard of Bitcoin and might become interested.
If Bitcoin succeeds then yes, it will provide high quality banking services. But that's the big question.  And it won't succeed unless people like me go out and make it succeed.  So yes, I treat it as my bank and only convert to fiat when I absolutely have to. If you choose to have your savings in Dollars, obviously you miss out on any Bitcoin gains and vice versa.  No real way around that.

I have no experience with the buying bitcoins with Euros part. But you can create a wallet with Coinbase, send the bitcoins you want to convert to dollars to the Coinbase wallet and Coinbase will buy them from you for a 1% fee.  This is pretty hassle-free option but you will need: a verifiable U.S. bank account, acceptance of the fact that Coinbase seems to be trying hard to work within U.S. regulations, and time (about 1 week).

"Decentralized" means there is no central authority issuing the currency and no central clearing house verifying all the transactions.  Currency issuance is hardcoded in the software run by each client and and each client verifies the blockchain independently.
Your issues have some validity but are not related to decentralization per se.

1. Yes. Bitcoins are [fungible](  Any Bitcoin wallet will be able to spend any bitcoin you may come to possess.
2. Your phone app would be your wallet.  Paper wallets are for offline storage, not for making transactions. Probably most transactions at this point in time are made from personal computers running wallets such as MultiBit, Electrum, or Bitcoin-Qt.
3. I think some of Bitcoin's main advantages over other e-currencies are that it is decentralized, very secure against counterfeiting, and has a huge amount of hashing power backing up that security.

When you say "spend" bitcoins, all that actually happens is you sign a transaction with your private random number that shifts some accounting on the distributed ledger.

There is no hard-coded transaction fee between all clients/wallets.  0.002 should currently be enough for your transaction to get picked up by most miners.  They are trying to get people to switch to a fee amount based on the size of your transaction message.  For example, if your transaction is grouping a bunch of small inputs, it will be a larger message and need a larger fee.  But this isn't standardized across all clients yet and, to be honest, is somewhat painful to do at the software level.  I'm not sure what Blockchain.info's standard transaction fee but I hope it is greater than 0.

If there is no internet you have to use the honor system (paper receipts and paper wallets) until such time as the internet is restored. These days traditional banking has this same weakness.  
As to your second point, its hard to imagine a case where north america and Europe where only peering with each other and had no peer connections to the wider world.  But what I understand would happen is a fork would occur.  The blockchain with more acceptance on the network would win out.  The "bad" blocks would have to be discarded out and the transactions re-broadcast to the "good" fork.  ...I think, good question, though.

Nice rebuttal.  It seems to me the market has/had a demand for a new form of money and Bitcoin was created at the right time to fulfill that demand.  It is interesting that bitcoin did not have earlier market use.  But just because one school of thought thinks that is required, doesn't make it fact.  When earlier thoughts on the theory of money were formulated a scarce intangible good that was divisible, recognizable, portable and durable was unimaginable.  Society is taking an active part in the evolution of money now with new tools that have become available.

Yes, you could.  Use the [Withdraw]( command which takes you to a personal message to the bot screen, where you'd enter the bitcoin address and amount to send. 
You can have bitcoins sent to your account at the address given to you with the [Get Balance]( command.  However, and I can't stress this enough, If you are doing much bitcoining, you really should get your own wallet that sits on your own computer.  They are free and some, such as [MultiBit]( use very small amounts of computer resources and disk space.

Wallets are a general term for files that bitcoin clients use to manage private keys.  The Private Key is what is necessary for you to be able to spend your bitcoin. 
If your private key (stored in the wallet) is lost, your funds are also lost.  You are responsible for backing up your wallet file to a safe location.  On the positive side: nobody (no bank) can close your "account" or stop you from spending your money.

The address you are sending too and the amount to send is all you need.  Coinbase will dig up the private keys to specific coinage and sign the transaction for you.  I would recommend getting an "easy" client such as Multibit.org on your home computer.  This client will generate a receiving address for you.  You can practice sending small transactions back and forth between your Multibit wallet and your Coinbase wallet.

Nobody can tell that sending address A and receiving address B are controlled by the same person. Even if they are controlled by the same person, if you want that transaction be valid on the blockchain, you have to pay the fee.  Right now Miners really only consider the block rewards when calculating if mining would be profitable for them.  As block rewards decrease over time, transaction fees will become much more important.  Don't worry I had the same questions getting started, too.

I think you can send a signed TX to a specific miner who then puts it in his stack of TX to hash against.  Only when that particular miner solves a block is the TX first seen on the network (in that block).  Correct me if I'm wrong.  
This also avoids attaching IP information since your TX is never transmitted peer-to-peer.

I ran with the -testnet flag.  I gave it a separate -datadir so it doesn't conflict with my Production instance. It did download the testnet blockchain quickly and correctly showed my balance on the priv key I imported from bitcoinj.   So perhaps I can't help much.  I assume you are running bitcoinD in a headless environment and cannot run bitcoinQT (like I am)...

Supernode does index a lot in the DB which adds about 2 more gigs to it's  Blockchain right now.  But the sucker is fast.  Most people (lol, probably only a handful right now) tunnel Supernode through a bitcoind router to avoid fork issues.  You really only communicate with Supernode through the [API]( and using [Stomp]( or something you can do natively in your chosen language.  So no extra Java madness, just like you don't deal with the underlying C++ madness of bitcoind.

Also consider risks in POS devices.  Scenario: I own a store that accepts bitcoin as payment.  My employee (sales clerk) changes the address displayed to the customer to an address under his/her control.  Customer pays and walks out the door and I (the store owner) never get paid.  This can also happen to compromised websites on the server end (https notwithstanding). BIPs 70 to BIP 72 addresses these issues.
@_date: 2013-09-02 01:03:35
Thank you for your questions and suggestions.  


Many details need to be worked out and I envision Phase III to be an ongoing process hooking BitCashier up to more and more web frameworks. As a reference target, I would like brick-and-mortar shops to be able to quickly and non-technically set this up for Point-of-Sale on an android tablet.  It would need an HD public key and then it's ready to start accepting payments.


Yes, I consciously left specific TTPs mentions off of The Proposal and Bitcoin Starter posts. A moment of weakness here on Reddit, my apologies. And agreed, these TTPs are currently serving a very valuable, perhaps critical, role. I'm just taking the longer view.
I believe this project will take 6 weeks of full-time work to get a good start. I quite simply don't have the opportunity to drop my current clients to pursue a non-revenue generating venture.  Some financial support for this project would give me the time and space needed to take the leap.
[BIP 70]( looks interesting and addresses the main vector of attack I think BitCashier could be susceptible to...  Basically somebody (front desk clerk or an intruder sitting on a webserver) redirecting the addresses generated by BitCashier, before they are presented to the customer, to their own address. Confidence that funds sent to addresses generated by BitCashier are secure with an offline master private key is high. But confidence that addresses generated by BitCashier are the actual addresses presented to the user is an issue.  In such a case, the customer would have sent funds while the Merchant would never receive confirmation on the BitCashier generated address.

Sounds like your desktop wallet runs a full node. This means it downloads the whole blockchain (every transaction) and verifies all of it to be thorough.  The android app downloads just the block headers and looks only for things of interest, namely transactions dealing with your address(es).  
There are desktop wallets that can do this as well.  [Multibit](  is a good one.  In fact Multibit and and Bitcoin Wallet (for android by Andreas Schildbach) are running the same software under the hood. Which is called [BitcoinJ]( 
Running a full node is helpful for the network but takes a long time to download and is resource intensive. But running a light (or "SPV") wallet is not frowned upon.  There is a case where the P2P network surrounding a SPV wallet can be hostile and convince the SPV wallet that it is receiving bogus coins.  But the possibility is super-extremely low and not really much of a factor for sporadic, lightweight bitcoin commerce.

News flash: Bitcoin is still very much in early-adopter phase.
Quick questions: How many people have I and people like me sold bitcoins to via localbitcoins.com?  How many miners are there? How many merchants use Coinbase/Bitpay, the darknet, or their own DIY solutions? How many bitcoins have traded via @_date: 2013-11-27 05:33:37

I think it is just profit taking by traders on Gox.  Judging by the China price, Gox should be higher.

One would assume that this means the currency is already stable in the short run?  Kind of rules out Bitcoin although I believe it has the potential for long term stability after the deflationary kinks have been worked through.

If you sell some portion of a bitcoin for more than you bought it (including fees) the difference can be called "profit".  Sorry, just saying "nonnoob" does not necessarily make it so.
@_date: 2013-11-16 06:08:01
Nothing has intrinsic value.  You may wish to argue that point...  But humans apply value and it tends to follow supply and demand.  Humans have a history of valuing gold but if the supply of gold suddenly multiplied, the value of gold would decrease (in relation to other things).  A tribe's religious relics may hold more value to them than their own lives but for me holds no value.
Primarily, to me, "fiat" means a currency a country requires to pay a debt (taxes) and the issuing country can manipulate the supply of the currency "by decree".
In my mind Bitcoin is the opposite of fiat currency.  It is money. There is a well-defined fungible, divisible, recognizable supply that will not change or else the whole experiment breaks down.

The final frontier...
This would be a game changer, in my estimation.  The current problem is that the Plugin Container that ships with most browsers makes it a nightmare if not down-right impossible to develop even an SPV-style wallet as a plugin. That's not to mention security issues.  On the other hand, if Tor and PirateBay can patch and release Firefox for their purposes, What's stopping us from doing the same?  Holy Grail: patch Firefox to support wallets at the application level...   Go!

If you trust the seller... You could immediately sell those coins for $800 profit on Bitstamp right now so it seems fishy.

Is it a technical issue or philosophical? There has to be some sort of peg for value.  If you sell shirts for dollars and the cost of cotton rises, you have to increase the price in dollars else you go out of business. Think of it as the cost of cotton decreasing in terms of Bitcoins... if that's any help.

Yes, if somebody knows how to read code, open-source provides auditing capability, if it is actually done.  Many projects are large and a full audit is not always possible between the time somebody posts it on reddit and people start using it.  
I'm reminded of a backdoor that was once inserted into the ftpd open source software, but don't remember all of the details off hand.
I have not looked at this project's source code because I currently have no need for the functionality.

A little background: I work freelance. Everybody seems to want server-side wallets. Every server side wallet has been hacked unless you're like 1dice, coinbase.  I personally watched  get rocked tonight. whatever, i fear these guys and i think my fear is justified. They seem to want bitcoin go client-side like everybody i know who is involved.
