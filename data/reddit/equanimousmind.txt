[The question of Reddit Inc accepting BitCoin should be re-considered. It is clearly a decision that will give Reddit Inc more monies.](

i think it has to be more interesting than a standard psyops spam operation. I suspect their looking for things that are censorship robust. You know things like Tor, which was heavily financed by the State Department. 
I was thinking a mobile p2p meshnet scheme would be interesting. You provide the platform, let state department agents and freedom fighters do the FUD generation and dissemination.

wa? please! 
I'm posting if anyone has any interesting projects they want to fly around. Its not a state department employment page.. take their money when you can.

its cool. anyone who found the opportunity useful probably didn't need community validation in the comments. ;) 
I just want Redditors to start being informed of these kinds of opportunities as well as other communities.

i suppose strictly speaking it is keeping money in the pool. But we shouldn't mind too much money moving in and out of the economy. We kind of should be agnostic to it. 
But I was thinking, it's a problem if someone has btc and wants to buy a high priced item, but thinks that because the btc price will increase, holds off buying. It's better for merchants accepting btc, if everyone is just considering their product's value and not the fluctuating value of btc in consumption decisions.

i suppose i wanted to emphasize the support me with arguments bit. I think persuasive arguments will have more impact on a decision like this than a mob. although a persuasive mob would be quite powerful...

just because their intentions arn't pure and that situation is complicated; doesn't necessarily mean there isn't an opportunity here. 
@_date: 2012-10-02 20:35:40
there was also the rise of more sophisticated marketing by corporations. This has been another reason why there has been an increase in cheap consumerism. 
I'm really not sure that the switch away from gold backing had much to do with planned obsolescence. 
@_date: 2012-10-02 11:47:36


yes/no. in the extreme you want to avoid a run on any currency but in fear of that you don't need to have a kind of fear of what is healthy and normal flow of money between currencies. Liquidity brings transaction costs down, which only helps more btc to be transacted net. 


This is interesting :) 
I wasn't really putting forward a hard thesis that we have significant disinflation forces in the btc; more, I think it's something to keep an eye on. 
With the cases your citing. We might have the causation in the wrong order. It could have been rising demand for bitcoin usage that driving btc price up, not rising btc causing increased spending. 
So I would be arguing that periods of rapid price increase might have some kind of consumer spending decrease, probably some kind of lag factor though. it would be interesting to look at. I guess the really easy way to look at this is to see liquidity and amount of btc traded against btc price and check for anything.

you know the interesting thing would be to realize that both bitcoin and USD are fake. They only have value because other people think they have value. 
What is "real" money. Even backed by gold, it requires other monkeys to want shiny metal.

haha I'm reminded of the guy who bought the first pizza with bitcoin. Afterwards when the btc price was higher and people asked what he thought about having bought a thousand dollar pizza he was like "meh, it was a good pizza." 
I also agree that the btc price is probably going to be a lot higher. But at the same time, I don't think the strategy to get there is to create a cult around btc that it's some kind of magic investment. The US white economy by itself is around 15tn GDP, to even take a small chunk of that proper, would put btc price skyrocketing. So the angle to get btc price up isn't to keep talking about great it is that it is going up, but keep pushing it's wider takeover of the old world economy. Bubble thinking is just going create a cycle of hard ups and downs without any correlation to wider actual economic btc activity. we want btc entrepreneurs not btc speculators.

i think many are in that spot. Bricks and mortar adoption might be hard to switch over for now; but I really think we should be pushing wider adoption for e-commerce. Even small things like being able to buy reddit gold are important. We need to expanding the the choice set of things we can buy with btc. 
Right now when you go to bitcointalk; it's mostly the same same. Most of the latest "new" btc projects are just new e-wallets. 
@_date: 2012-09-28 01:17:26
um no. 
bitcoin is just a decentralized system of economic interactions. There's no inherent reason why it would cause money to go from the rich to the poor. In fact, it's likely to follow a power law distribution like all interactive system. Inequality will be built into bitcoin as much as anything else. 
We should stop making bitcoin into things it's not. It's not a magic investment. That leads to bubble thinking. It's not automatically anonymous. This leads to people making mistakes because of miscalculations. 
It's decentralized and so no-one can stop the flow of transactions. This by itself is the power of btc. You will never be able to put an financial blockade on an activist organization again by just tapping a few powerful points of control in the traditional financial system. 
@_date: 2012-10-02 20:26:10
agree that planned obsolescence is a problem. But I feel this has more to do with corporate dominance of our economy more than anything. It's a more profitable strategy to sell people something crap many times than something good once. This shouldn't work with a lot of competition, but often corporations are able to get a lock on markets. 
It's not like the btc economy isn't full of it's capitalist sharks as well. I mean the darknet is not a good place for the gullible consumer. 
@_date: 2012-10-02 08:10:38
this is actually a pretty good illustration of why increasing price is a bad thing. By pushing btc as an investment, we have this kind of deflationary force of people not wanting to sell or spend btc because they think it'll probably go up in value by hoarding. 
More than the price chart, we want greater liquidity, people need to give less of a fuck about collecting an investment profit and just be building the btc economy buying and selling cool stuff with btc.

I should like that people generally didn't care about government laws; but we're playing for the margins here. The uncertainty affects the current crop first adopters not so much. It does affect the amount of outside investment into Bitcoin businesses though. There's still cases of large angel investors and venture capitalists coming in; but we won't see anything like the dot com bubble flood of investment until more boring kind of rich investors feel comfortable. Its kind of an invisible loss that we suffer. 
@_date: 2012-09-26 08:59:01
sort of... SOPA was a huge deal and hitting GD was a pretty big OP, for reddit at least. It's kind of weird for anyone who cares about P2P, online freedom stuff, to not know about GD being asshats. 
edit: although to be fair i guess he isn't based in the US, so maybe it didn't really cross over into Brazlian social hubs of the net.... still....  
@_date: 2012-06-29 17:17:27
well the easy answer is to instant convert it via bit-pay. Then its essentially taking USD, its just btc for the redditor. 
i've been thinking about this though. I don't think it is money or profits until you convert it. Which isn't a huge problem for accounting, you just balance it with some kind of receivables or something. 
But its interesting in that you could do alot of tax minimization by withholding profit. 
edit: I'm not actually an accountant.

Reddit Inc took an anti-establishment stance on SOPA/PIPA and now CISPA. It would make me sad if they were boycotting Bitcoin for political reasons.. I'm assuming good faith for now. 
@_date: 2012-10-02 18:41:29
:) that's very wise; but wise isn't how we do capitalism. Maybe we need to start a btc loan bubble and maybe start securitizing dodgy btc loans into instruments nobody understands and use that money to make more dodgy btc loans! BUY BUY BUY!!!

but accepting btc for reddit gold would just be a first step and good endorsement. There are benefits for the Bitcoin and Reddit community aside from the direct financial.. even though thats the angle I took on that ideasfortheadmins post.

Most of the paper is pretty summary and blah blah of bitcoin vendors and stuff. But gets more interesting when it comes to legalities of Bitcoin. Has a pretty run through how the Stamps Act potentially works with Bitcoin. 


Bitcoin is pragmatic. It is a 150-year-old statute that has outlived its
usefulness. Courts began limiting its application almost immediately
after it was passed. Although many academic works have noted
that the Stamp Payments Act may be a problem for digital
currencies, and digital currencies have existed for more than a
decade, there has been no published court opinion interpreting the
Act since 1899. And the comparatively lenient punishments
available for violations of the Act (fine and maximum six month
imprisonment) and availability of more fitting statutes under which to attack Bitcoin, as described infra, are likely to dissuade prosecutors
from trying to breathe new life into the Stamps Payment Act. *p32-33*
Its also interesting to note that the constitution only prohibits states from issuing currency; not individuals.
