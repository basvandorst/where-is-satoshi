Okay... I just opened up a business account with TD.  My password is limited to 8 alphanumeric characters.  The best password policy I've seen at a bank so far has been 16 characters.  They've literally made it impossible for me to pick a secure password.  Also, my security questions (that I had to choose from a list) are all things that anyone could look up if they could be bothered.
For that matter, why are we even using passwords at all?  We've had public key cryptography since the 70s, and it's been available to the masses since the 90s.
Also, the comic linked in this very post points out what's wrong with credit cards.
@_date: 2014-10-23 14:32:53
Okay... suppose it's them jerking you around and not the banks.  For what purpose?  To *not* collect the transaction fee?  That seems a dubious conclusion at best.

A few months ago I was housesitting for a friend while she was out of the country. 
She texted me to let me know that she had underestimated the amount of cash she would need. Told me where to find a spare debit card and some emergency cash, and asked me to make a deposit to her account.
I got to the teller, and they wouldn't let me deposit to the account, because I wasn't her. I ended up walking over to the ATM and depositing the money there.
I made sure to do this in plain sight of the teller out of spite.

@_date: 2014-10-23 12:21:43
When those centralized companies got too big, their banks started taking notice of them, and threatening to seize their assets for non-compliance.
The banks and governments have them by the balls on the fiat end.

@_date: 2014-10-23 12:19:10
As someone who's operating a business that deals in cryptocurrency (not bitcion), I would like to remind you that we are at the whims of our banks.  If the bank says to not allow something, we have no choice.  Otherwise, they'll sieze all our assets, and we're left holding the bag with basically no recourse.
Fortunately, we've been pretty lucky in this regard so far.  Being in Canada is helpful.

Since they're running a Ripple gateway, it's kinda pointless to try to enforce minimum trades since they have absolutely no control of them on the Ripple end.
@_date: 2014-01-17 12:56:10
The difference between bitcoin and any of the currencies they've successfully stopped is that bitcoin is decentralized.  Since there's no central controlling entity, it's much harder to do anything about.
Sure, they can put legal and economic pressure on the US exchanges, but the rest of the world just keeps on going.
@_date: 2014-11-11 18:21:15
They won't, but they'll make it unnecessary to deal in bitcoin at all, thus entirely sidestepping the problem.
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:27:09
[VirtEx]( and [Valult of Satoshi]( seem to have managed to pull it off.
Also, when I opened my account with my [credit union]( I told them specifically that I would be buying and selling bitcoin.  They told me this wouldn't be a problem (granted, I had to go shopping around to get this answer).
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:15:37
I agree. I also think that the term bits is going to confuse newbies because they'll think it's a slang term for bitcoin. mBTC is much more straight forward... at least to people who live in countries where the metric system is used.

This would be great, but I don't think it's realistic. Bitcoin is still a fledgling technology. Most people are still afraid of it. I suspect that bitcoin itself will have been superseded by something else before this can happen.
That said, cryptocurrency is here to stay. The genie is out of the bottle, and it's not going back in. Bitcoin itself may not succeed at this, but I'd be very surprised if some form of cryptocurrency didn't eventually.
The only question in my mind is how long will it take.

@_date: 2014-08-29 20:46:38
Why do you say this?
Fiat currency gets devalued when more is printed, but this isn't creating new Bitcoin; it's simply allowing everyone to further subdivide the Bitcoin they already have.  I see no reason for this to affect the price, although, I will grant you that the price of Bitcoin does sometimes change dramatically for ridiculous reasons.
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:44:59
In fairness, the former is probably the reason for the latter.
@_date: 2014-11-19 12:18:52
Yes. Which begs the question as to why we didn't just use uBTC... other than to confuse the newbies.

However, anybody who put money into bitcoin that they couldn't afford to lose is a moron.

This is why I keep a small amount of money in a local exchange.  I don't have to wait for it to clear before I can buy bitcoin for someone who wants it (and charge a small fee for the service).  I then take the cash they handed me and put it back into my account.
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:25:06

Remember, bitcoin is a revolutionary new technology that the average layman doesn't understand. It's only five years old.
When the internet was only five years old, it was the domain of nerds, and pretty much nobody else. It was widely seen as a passing fad. This is effectively what we're seeing with bitcoin today.
You're right on one thing, though: anyone who invests money they can't afford to lose in bitcoin is a fool. It's far too volatile. I've been saying this from day one. You're just being too short-sighted. That's all.
That said, people who get in, watch the price fall, and sell off are probably a significant part of the reason I've made profit on bitcoin, so I suppose I should be thanking you.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:55:29
I had toyed with the idea of a system that encrypts the whole drive, except a small bootable partition which prompts the user for a password, sends that password securely over Tor to a remote machine which then responds with the decryption key for the drive.
If the key is not successfully retreived periodically, the remote machine destroys the key.
That way, if a third party seizes your machine, but can't locate the key server, it self-destructs in a way they can't prevent.
I've never been paranoid/bored/free enough to actually implement this, though.
@_date: 2014-10-14 14:26:32
Me too.  The more volatile the price, the more money I make.
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:12:13
The most frequent response I get is still "what's that?"

This is why you say you want to close your account instead.
@_date: 2014-09-02 03:55:31
According to the linked article, yes.
@_date: 2014-09-19 11:34:23
Yes.  For the price to go down, someone has to be buying it at that price.
@_date: 2014-08-29 04:56:54
Perhaps, but if I wanted a safe long-term store of value, my bet would still be on gold.
That said, I'm holding Bitcoin because I expect the price will still rise significantly in the long term, but I recognise it to be a risky investment. It's also much more useful as a currency than gold.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:05:53
The key sent to the server, or the key received from the server?
The former can be addressed by destroying the decryption key after n unsuccessful attempts.  The later can be addressed with a large amount of entropy.  It's not like it needs to be something that can be remembered by a human.  This is the same reason you can't brute-force a bitcoin secret key from the wallet address.
As for the rendering your computer unusable in certain circumstances... I *did* say it was a paranoid approach.  There's always a trade-off between security and convenience.
Plus, you can get around this particular limitation by tethering to a phone.

There are only two points where I think he's wrong (or at least potentially wrong).
1) He says that gold will hold its value for hundreds of years, and then says that Bitcoin outperforms gold in every way.  Frankly, nobody knows if Bitcoin is going to retain its value a hundred years from now.  We don't even know what its value will be a month from now.
2) He says that you can know that you have a good Bitcoin seconds after receiving it.  While in most cases, it's probably a safe bet, it's best to wait a for a few confirmations first.  To get the generally accepted six confirmations takes about an hour.  Granted, this is still faster than basically any other form of money transfer.

Apart from holding a small amount of BTC from years ago, I've been outside the whole cryotocurrency world for a while now.
I've heard arguments from the BCH crowd about scaling problems with BTC which I know enough about how Bitcoin works to understand (insufficient block size to handle all the transactions).
I've heard grumblings about SegWit and LN, but I really don't know much about either (I've been meaning to read up on it). What makes them good/bad? I don't care about political posturing. I'm more interested in the technical merits/limitations of each system. What supposedly makes BTC better than BCH?

Given the original intent of bitcoin, I don't consider the scaling problem solved until it can be solved trustlessly.  That's kind of the whole point of bitcoin, isn't it?
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:26:46
A valid argument, but I still don't understand anything about how LN proposes to solve this. I've heard arguments that LN is a centralized solution (which seems antithetical to the whole Bitcoin philosophy) but I don't really know enough about it to know if that's true or just rhetoric.
I guess I've got to do some independent research.

The idea behind Ripple is quite different from the idea behind bitcoin.
As mentioned, Ripple is based on trust, whereas bitcoin is completely trustless.  The thing that makes Ripple unique is that you get to choose who you put your trust in (similar to how trust works in PGP).
I've never viewed XRP as a viable currency, just a thing I needed to have some of to make the network work, and use the actual interesting bits.
@_date: 2019-09-22 23:32:37

@_date: 2015-04-16 20:34:43
Yeah... I've been disappointed by some of RL's recent decisions, but I haven't yet seen anything that's a deal breaker for me in terms of the protocol itself.
There are third-party clients that don't require identification.  From the looks of it, the AML/KYC will be relatively decentralized (also working something like a PGP web of trust).  If I understand correctly, it'll be up to a specific gateway to either attest to someone's identity, or have a list of trusted attestors.
For someone like me, who is more interested in the social credit aspect of the network, none of this really makes a difference.
What I do worry about however, is the near-centralized state of the current ledger.  I've been meaning to do more research on the consensus process.
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:15:28
Here's what I don't understand. I know it's just a stopgap measure, but what's wrong with increasing the block size? To me (with my admittedly limited understanding) that seems preferable than a (centralized?) off-chain solution.
What makes LN a more reasonable solution?

We're not trusting an "anonymous hacker".  We're trusting open, auditable, code, based on mathematical rules that can't be easily changed, except by consensus of the entire network (or at least a majority of it).

As someone who's served as a branch clerk, it would be difficult to get them to accept tithing in bitcoin. All church unit accounts have to be approved by Salt Lake.  Also, you get a tax receipt at the end of the year on your tithing, so I'm not sure how that would affect things.
The university is a separate entity, so the rules there may be different, although I'll admit I was surprised to see them make this decision.
That said, it would be nice to be able to pay tithing on the bitcoin portion of my income directly in bitcoin, so I'd like to be proven wrong here.

As a long-standing Ripple user, Ripple both is and isn't debt based.
If you're using XRP as a straight-up currency (as some people would like to see it happen), then no, it isn't debt based.  IMHO, doing this would be dumb though.  If that's how I want to use Ripple, I might as well just use bitcoin (and I do).
If you treat XRP as a spam prevention mechanism (the way it was first intended to be used), the rest of the system operates on a series of IOUs in whatever currency you want it to work in.  It's all about extending personal credit to people you know and trust, and allowing the system to coordinate payments by finding trust paths between people.
I've pointed this out a couple times now, and I don't want to keep typing it.  See [my previous comment]( for a more detailed description of what I'm talking about.

XRPs, not XPRs.
Personally, I don't care what the price of XRP is, I don't plan on selling it.  I use it for making transactions happen and nothing more.  Anybody (Suzie included) can get enough to do that for about $1-2.
If the price of XRP raises, the network fees [edit: and reserve] drop.  In fact, it's already happened once.  Were this not the case, the Ripple network would cease to be useful.
The fact that people are making money off it is completely irrelevant to me.  That money doesn't come out of my pocket.  It's only the speculators who would get screwed, and I feel no sympathy for them, just as I feel no sympathy for Bitcoin speculators.

Yes, but the catch here is that its a distributed system, and its the protocol itself that's still being finalized.  The idea is that if they release it as-is now, it's going to be a pain in the butt to upgrade the entire network when it's finally ready for prime time.

The problem being that the price can change drastically between the time the price in BTC is quoted, and the time the transaction actually clears.
The man in the middle has three options:
1) Convert it immediately and risk getting burned by a double spend.
2) Wait for it to clear and exchange it at the current value (possibly screwing the vendors).
3) Wait for it to clear, and pay the vendor the fee it would have been converted (possibly screwing themselves).
@_date: 2013-05-21 12:31:36

100% of the coins are "pre-mined" (a ridiculous term as there's no mining process). Would you care to explain to me why this is a bad thing?
Also, I can't claim that anybody owes me anything. They have to issue the IOUs themselves.  Sure, I could create a bogus account and give myself some arbitrarily large amount of money, but it doesn't do me any good since that money is only good if other people trust IOUs from that account.

If you'd been actually reading the thread, you'd have understood that XRP exists as a spam prevention mechanism.  It's what prevents the Ripple network from having to do computationally expensive proof-of-work calculations.
Yes, OpenCoin plans on making money off of Ripple.  Personally, I don't care.  I'd wager that Satoshi made a pretty penny off of bitcoin due to early mining.  I don't fault him for that, either.
Fact of the matter is, if someone gets rich creating a useful technology, they deserve every penny.

You realize that the reason that they can pay you interest at all is because they lend it out at higher interest to someone else.  If they have to keep a 100% reserve, there's no way for them to do this, unless they feel like just giving you their own bitcoin for fun.
Generally, the reason you put money in a bank is to make it easier to move around.  With bitcoin, that problem is already solved.  (Because let's face it, most people pay more in bank fees than they make in interest.)

VirtEx has always been pro-active about keeping things above board.  From the very beginning they were collecting GST on their transaction fees and remitting it to the government, even though they didn't have to.
They were also willing to hand over all their receipts to the bank, and what ever regulatory bodies wanted them.  I find it hard to believe that there was anything shady going on (with VirtEx, at least... can't comment on the banks).

Turns out they're $1.99, which is lower than the fee was with a cash deposit through the bank.

Perhaps not a billionaire, but you'd have to be pretty naïve to think that he/she/they haven't made a boatload of money off Bitcoin.

This is what is known as a double spend.  It might work for a bit, but the network will ultimately cancel one of the transactions (unless you had enough money in your wallet for both).
This is why you should always wait for multiple confirmations on a transaction before trusting it.

This is true as long as either of the following conditions are met:
* There is only one person who has ever contributed to the code, and it's been relicensed by that person.
* The person who relicensed it received written permission from everyone who contributed to the code.
Also, you can modify a GPL'd program however you want without having to release source as long as you're not distributing it. Using it to run a website doesn't count as distributing it (unless it's licensed under the Affero GPL).

Sure, but I never said anything about value in terms of dollars or other fiat currency.
When I use dollars, I don't particularly care what it's worth in terms of euros or yen.  I do however, concern myself very much with how many days of groceries they're worth, or how much gas they'll put in my tank.  In other words, I care a great deal about the value of my currency, whatever currency it happens to be.
The minute you can exchange one thing for another, markets will form around that thing.  It's pretty inevitable.

Are they talking about RBC and Scotiabank shutting down VirtEx's accounts?  Last I heard, they didn't give a reason publicly.  If so, can someone confirm this?
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:27:07
If that friend happened to be someone they trusted.  The fact is, this is the way the banking system works in the first place.
When I deposit money into my bank account, I'm accepting an IOU from the bank for that amount.  When I then go to the grocery store and pay with my debit card, my bank's IOU from me instead gets redirected to the store's bank, who then issues the store an IOU for the amount I paid.  The difference here is that it allows anyone to form those trust paths, not just banks.

When compared to bitcoin, yes; when compared to credit cards, no.

The bitcoin network had been running for quite some time before the general public knew about it.  At that time it was *way* easier to mine bitcoin.  Don't try to tell me Satoshi didn't have an advantage.  We both know that's false.

The problem I find bitcoin people have having with Ripple is that they're treating XRP like bitcoin.  They're effectively different things (although, you could use XRP as currency if you wanted to).
[Here's a comment I wrote earlier explaining the difference between bitcoin and Ripple.](  They're both useful, but for different reasons.

The US dollar is backed by the US government... who has the ability to print more of it at will.
Bitcoin is backed by an algorithm that essentially guarantees the rate at which it will be created.  Its value is fluctuating right now because the market at large is still trying to come to terms with what it is, and how it affects them.

Honestly, I don't care what the price of bitcoin is.  I'd just like to see it stabilize somewhat.  If we want it to see it become a widely accepted currency, that needs to happen first.
One of the things stopping a lot of vendors from accepting it is its volatility.

The article gets some things wrong about how cryptography works (but close enough that it won't matter for the average person).
On symmetric key cryptography:


Actually, in a symmetric key algorithm, the encryption key *is* the decryption key.
On asymmetric key cryptography:


Actually, the owner of the public key generates both keys at the same time using a random seed.  If all you have is the private key, it's just as hard to determine the public key as it is to go the other way around. (I might be wrong on this one.  Please correct me if I am.)
Also, messages are very rarely sent using asymmetric key cryptography alone.  That would be very computationally expensive.  Usually you'll just randomly generate a (much smaller) symmetric session key, encrypt that using the recipient's public key and encrypt the actual message with your newly generated session key (and then throw the session key out, never using it again).  This also has the benefit of letting you encrypt a message once, and send it to multiple people by just re-encrypting the session key using all of the recipients' public keys.

@_date: 2013-04-27 11:54:07
I guess you could call it that.  I hold and use bitcoin primarily because I want to see it succeed.  I think that despite its shortcomings, it has several advantages over fiat currency.
I've also put noting into it I can't afford to lose.  At this point, it would be crazy to do otherwise.

I don't follow the logic that they'll be more scarce. Sure they'll be produced at a slower rate, but there will be more of them overall.

When I want to buy bitcoin, I tell VirtEx that I'm going to make a deposit (and for what amount), walk down to the bank, give them their bank account info and cash, and within a couple hours, I have cash in the system to trade with.  I then withdraw to my wallet, or wherever else I want the BTC to go.  It's pretty easy (although, there are fees incurred through VirtEx).
