This is the problem with Bitcoin, go ahead and pollute the air heathens
IOTA only consumes 0.0001 kwh 
Whereas 
Bitcoin is around 340 kwh
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:05:44
Because bitcoin is a huge waste of energy and is massively inefficient 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:38:31
Bitcoin is shit, invest in a real crypto
@_date: 2018-10-07 14:52:46
Lol yes, very relevant, but bitcoin it seems isn't

Grade A level shitpost for a grade A level shitcoin

Typically when a Bitcoin user switches from "YAY I wanna make money" to "what can this technology do for people" they instantly drop Bitcoin as
It helps contribute to global warming
isn't really decentralized anymore
has very few unique and cool features whereas most other cryptos have an updated list of cool features that would actually be useful

Bitcoin will crash to 0
@_date: 2018-11-11 14:53:30
Why not use a currency that requires less energy, they are out there

We will never see him again r.i.p

Do people still think these are "dips"?
Clear bitcoin is dead
@_date: 2019-09-26 01:26:42
Dude, Bitcoin is dangerous for the environment, it's centralized as fuck as China owns over 50% hashing power, it is one of the most basic cryptos as it doesn't support any key features like smart contacts, feelessness, speed, it's awful
@_date: 2019-09-26 02:40:53
Not the biggest, 300 mi, as cheesy as it might sound i'm not so much in it for the money, more of the actual tech as IOTA has the potential to make a bunch of changes, the money is an added bonus
@_date: 2019-09-26 05:18:16
One of these times it will die as the fanbase is full of 9 year olds who think "looking cool" will keep it alive forever that's literally the only thing bitcoin has going for it nowadays

And you don't know me��

Yikes, this community is darker than I thought��

I think Bitcoin could succeed with IOTA since IOTA is planning on allowing transactions from other cryptos to be linked to an IOTA transaction so you can send bitcoin over the tangle and make bitcoin feeless

No coin is completly centralized, I actually didn't know about the lightning network so that was helpful, with that knowledge I can at least see a somewhat reason why bitcoin can have some success but either way most cryptos are decentralized
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:09:32
Now you can tell the future? Okay, cool
Bitcoin will never work in my eyes, a less than $5 fee is a lot of money when you consider the future of the iot and 15 minutes is too long to wait around in a store with
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:07:27
Funny how you're questioning my knowledge without knowing me, I invested in bitcoin early on (maybe not early enough) but I was an early believer, im not anymore because its a waste of energy, the thing is, im not against bitcoin, i want to be convinced

Like I said, im here for a discussion, I do want answers, I actually like bitcoin because of my history with it
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:04:10
Yeah, I did actually, the community is a big part of the crypto as the community is the people who buy into the coin and it reflects the coin.
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:35:16
I'm aware but sometimes reddit has better answers and I like reddit, its also easier to avoid all the dumb hype videos and speculation
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:02:41
See, this is the issue, subreddits are for information and yet the bitcoin subreddit is completly unhelpful
I know a lot about Bitcoin however Im here for a discussion, if you don't want to have a discussion on it, don't respond
@_date: 2018-12-04 13:55:42
I get it, its just a waste of energy, its slow, its full of fees, the sub reddit is full of memes and very little progress is being made to improve the network
