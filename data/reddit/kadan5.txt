Wallet to another wallet or exchange. 
But I want to make sure I don't lose access to BCH.

Need help with accessing BCH. I couldn't move BTC to a wallet that offers to save private keys. 
If I move BTC to a different wallet does the private key change? Will I then lose access to BCH? 
How can I move both btc and bch from a wallet that doesnt give me access to private key?

Doubt that, a lot of untaxed income was put into bitcoin during the demonization of major currency notes.
Won't matter much to others though.. As still probably less than  3~5%

Yea but what if they made it illegal and major way to buy is via KYC exchanges

Under 100usd if another coin or coins with better or fair distribution comes into picture. Inequality is a threat to survival.

Cant China use its super computers to do this in conjunction with forcing current miners.

Or the new immigrants will, folks we limit to add more demand.
Crypto currency will truly unite the world. 
Also its interesting that projects like Wikipedia and bitcoin have both relations with the dark or illegal markets before becoming defacto
I still though believe it won't be bitcoin which will be the leader as it is too open and the distribution is what countries won't buy into, even though they are spectators in this bit they can still make it difficult for adoption. 
It'll probably be bunch of coins and backed by initiatives the world's people should collectively invest in. Like sustainability, solving poverty, medicine, asteroid defence, space and science in general and social things like ubi.
Maybe a leftist govt governed by smart contracts won't be all that bad. 
Democracy as we have seen is less likely to work with the quantity of information that is being produced, with expectations that people will be able to make informed choices.
