have a question about bitcoin fees. i deposited €2000 to coinbase via bank transfer. Then purchased bitcoins with this amount. the stated coinbase fee was €30
Next i transferred all the bitcoins to a trading website and on coinbases dashboard it says only €1830 worth of bitcoin transferred over even though the stated fee for this transfer was only €15
So there is like €120 worth of bitcoin that has just disappeared. there was no bitcoin price fluctuations between the 2 transactions. Are there any hidden fees i dont kow about?
Thanks for any help

so in your opinion this nothing out of the ordinary?
for my 2k i got 0.15423864 btc which according to coinbase is €1970 after their fee.
then when i transferred it out it has the record saying i transferred out −0.15423864 (exact same amount as i bought) at a value of €1830.00
just doesnt make sense to me
