These are awesome! My favorite is the dogecoin one on the homepage banner but I can't seem to find the source file or art anywhere else on your site :(

Bitcoin is not a deflationary cryptocurrency. It is decreasingly inflationary until sometime around the year 2140 when the last bitcoins stop being minted altogether. At **THAT POINT** it is a deflationary currency, but over 100 years away at this point.

Ya, that definition of deflationary might be usable for fiat or national currencies, but that is not what most people use to refer to crypto inflationary/deflationary currencies. Bitcoin has no GDP/"economic growth," it's simply a network for value transfer. Most people when discussing cryptos refer to inflationary cryptos if more are being minted as block rewards or some kind of incentive system and call things deflationary if there is a fixed amount or more leaving circulation than entering circulation.

Ya I know it seems like everything in crypto is a shilling game for alts, but in all honesty, I have no involvement with tezos, if anything, I think what they are doing is kind of interesting. I am a dogecoin enthusiast and hold doge - that's where my bias is.

Isn't this very thing what the Tezos team is trying to solve with their coin? "On chain consensus and governance" is what they call it. Basically the core client can be voted on by people in the network and changes are pushed out to everyone's core client based on PoS. Something like this, with its own improvements might be a good idea for Bitcoin or cryptos down the line to prevent this kind of gridlock we are seeing in the BTC community. 
Disclaimer: I hold no position on tezos (it's not even for sale yet) and don't even plan to buy any.

I've never heard of Decred, but honestly I shouldn't have even mentioned the name tezos, I'm in no way advocating or shilling for them, I just wanted to say the "on blockchain consensus and self-governance" theory that they are known for is really interesting. That's all. It could potentially solve a lot of these gridlock problems. As for the token and people behind it itself, I truly have no idea. I think people should stay away or do their due diligence before even going near it with their BTC. What I was getting at is that on chain consensus could be the "next generation feature"  of cryptos.

usually discusses upcoming presales. But in all honesty, there are so many ICO/EC20 ether chain tokens these days it's really difficult to know if you are getting fleeced or taken for a ride. Right now there is a lot of low hanging fruit that people hungry to make a quick buck off of are trying to reach for and will likely get burned. I usually try to pay attention to what the big core developers of ethereum and other large projects have to say about things that interest them. Usually when a core dev of another project talks genuine praise toward something else that he doesn't have a direct stake in yet, it is a sign of confidence so I check that out. If you read between the lines, you can tell when they post on reddit what projects they personally think are cool or might put their own money into. I wouldn't recommend buying too many presales at this hyped up time to be honest. I like to stick with established and secured blockchains during hypes (BTC for example) and speculate during a downturn.

As long as blockchains are the standard technology for a distributed ledger, Bitcoin will be near or at the top still due to its first mover advantage. But the above premise is not a given. A lot of new teams are toying with new architectures for distributed ledgers, IOTA's tangle ledger is an example of this. I am not saying tangle is the answer to decentralized ledgers, but it is feasible that some new breakthrough structure for a distributed ledger could eclipse blockchains.

Very nice!! That is some dogecoin level generosity in the bitcoin sub. This shibe solutes you, sir! :)

That's good to hear from Kraken. Very admirable. It's unfortunate Poloniex and Coinbase don't feel the same way.

Such guilt! You caught me. :P 
I am actually just a shibe from the doge community, I am a fan of BTC so I check in here more often than not. (I have no involvement with tezos)

Which exchange is that btw?

It makes Bitcoin a store of value more so than a currency. There's nothing wrong with that. I was just pointing out that gold is a really apt comparison instead of calling it digital cash or something. You wouldn't buy coffee with gold just like you're saying with bitcoin. It's just not realistic. If it's not realistic to buy coffee with Bitcoin, then it makes sense why it would be more of a store of value than a currency.

Thanks, that was enlightening. What a sick fuck..

I think that's strategic. Coinbase is a "status symbol." Getting on coinbase is equivalent for a crypto as reaching quasi-mainstream. They do it on purpose. If coinbase is adding you as a crypto &lt;--&gt; fiat endpoint you know as a coin you've probably "made it." It's not because of incompetence or laziness that they only have 3 offerings. It's strategic/brand.

That's pretty accurate description ironically considering the recent tx fees to send BTC. It truly makes it seem as slow and costly as it would be to lug around gold bars and send them to people....

You really are some kind of tinfoil hatter in your mom's basement aren't you? This is just hilarious. I've been on reddit for years and was into bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and the original series of alts back in the 2012-2014 era. Lost my reddit account, decided to get this one to promote the funnest of all cryptos (such WOW) because I am a fan of cryptos in general and dogecoin is kind of cool. Because I made one slight criticism of bitcoin being difficult to use recently as a currency due to exorbitant tx costs and the incoming Aug 1st protocol decisions, you think I am part of some conspiracy of big corporate interests that want to slander bitcoin? This is hilarious if it wasn't just sad...it's good that I know most of the bitcoin community isn't as batshit insane as you are since I've been in it since the early days, but damn man....this isn't a good look for all of us.

As a doge, I support this...
