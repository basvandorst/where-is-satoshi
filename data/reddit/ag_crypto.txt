I don't know and I don't care.  Very much like Jamie Dimon doesn't care about bitcoin, I don't care about Jamie Dimons opinion about anything, especially bitcoin.  Neither should anyone else, petty posts about some banker guy makes this community look like a bunch of whiney kids saying "nah nah told yah so".  Lets get back to the memes and shitposts about the price.

I don’t care about him potentially scaring away new people. I care about improving bitcoin and crypto in general to the point where people can actually use it for things in real life. New people coming in and pumping the price by treating crypto like penny stocks only hurts crypto in the long run. Because eventually the flow of new money will slow or stop and the price will drop and all most people will remember is that bitcoin was a scam and people lost lots of money.  But if we get to a point where bitcoin proves to be useable and can improve peoples lives and be of service to the world then it wont mattwr what anyone says about it, the facts will speak for themselves.  We dont need more cheerleaders telling morons who dont even know or care what bitcoin is or does buying it on coinbase because lambos. 
The price doesn’t matter if crypto isnt usable.  Bitcoin is just as useful at $1 as it is at $1,000,000.

Maybe. I think community actions have a bigger effect on the perception than the words of one guy that legislators may or may not even be aware of his opinions. 
Things like bitconnect which are outright pyramid schemes dont get nearly the amount of negative attention on here that the opinion of one guy who isn’t even a part of the community gets. Making the ecosystem less scammy would do more to relieve the perception that its a scam than yelling at the sky about jamie dimon.

misleading title and article.  He said this months ago.  He regrets calling bitcoin a fraud not because he has changed his mind and thinks he was wrong.  He regrets is because now no one will shut the fuck up about bitcoin to him and he doesn't care.  He even said it will probably go up in value, or down, he doesnt care.  Jamie Dimon doesn't give a fuck about bitcoin is his point.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:47:16
So posting an article that takes what he said out of context in an attempt to change its meaning is the way to combat that?
Lots of people have lots of opinions about crypto.  Posting an article with a misleading headline on reddit probably wont help to sway congress if thats your concern.

TIL using bitcoin is an attack on bitcoin???  And the way you support bitcoin is to use a sidechain and stop using bitcoin ??????
Why use bitcoin at all?  Why dont i support bitcoin by using cash off off off chain. Its a great scaling solution. If we can convince everyone to stop using bitcoin it will be great for bitcoin!

Coins earned from mining are considered income as detailed in the IRS notice.  So if you mine a coin worth $1000 you owe taxes as if you earned $1000 at a job. If you later sell that coin for $2000 you now owe capital gains on the $1000 profit you earned in value appreciation. 
So if you mine a coin and hold it abd never pay tax. This is the same as earning money from work and never paying taxes on it. Also known as tax evasion. 
If you mined your bitcoins, as IRS Notice 2014-21 elaborates, miners have to recognize income for each bitcoin mined during the taxable year. The amount of income equals the market price of bitcoin on the day it is awarded on the blockchain, which is also then the miner’s basis in the bitcoin going forward and is used to calculate gain/loss in the future. The IRS illustrates an example for taxpayers.
“…[A]ssume you mine 1 bitcoin in 2013,” the government tax agency writes. “On the day it was mined, the market price of bitcoin was $1,000. You have $1,000 of taxable income in 2013. Going forward, your basis in the bitcoin is $1,000. If you later sell the bitcoin for $1,200, you have a taxable gain of $1,200 – $1,000 = $200.”

correct, you can deduct expenses like power and possibly even hardware costs.  I would consult a CPA if you mine and trade crypto in meaningful amounts.

I would guess in a few years they will do the same thing again for current years and have an even easier time since precedent has been set.  They may even start mandatory reporting of large transactions on an ongoing basis or have been secretly ordered to do so already.
Personally I would be happy if coinbase made their users an easy to file report like my other traditional investments do, so come tax time I would have a full official record to forward to my accountant.  I paid my taxes the last 2 years on my modest crypto gains and had no issues so far, even though it would appear I am one of very few people who did so in the US...
Part of gaining acceptance of crypto by the govt and general public is proving its utility beyond illegal activity and money laundering.  If we have millions of people buying into crypto and a small handful paying their taxes that makes us all look bad and like tax evaders and criminals.
I would urge anyone who has sold crypto or traded it to pay your taxes as required in your country.  Not only will you not have to worry about facing an audit or even criminal charges, you'll become another metric for governments to realize that crypto users arent all just hackers and terrorists and drug dealers.

No one will ever find out. You’d have to sell a crypto kitty for it to be taxable and why would you ever sell a cryptokitty?
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:10:57
If you've been cashing out on major exchanges in the US and not paying the taxes owed thinking you're not going to get caught, you must be crazy.  You've made a permanent digital financial trail that leads to a regulated bank linked to your ID and bank accounts.  Seriously, just pay your taxes.  
To those who are holding long term, from my understanding there is no tax due until you trade for other cryptos, buy goods or services with them, or convert back to fiat.  if you are mining you should report your rewards as income based on the value when mined, then if you cash those out pay capitol gains on any appreciation.  Not legal advice, look it up yourself, but thats what I understand to be the case in the US.

My guess is that our humble reddit community does not contain enough whales to move the market.  Most of the people I see saying "I'm dumping everything" likely have 1 BCC at the most.....
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:29:46
LN isn’t bitcoin.  Why not just use ethereum or dogecoin at that point. They are probably more secure and easy to use than LN. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:00:54
People who had BTC on bittrex before the fork are currently trading.  I'm going to go on a limb and say thats a LOT of BCC and its just going up there.
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:26:03
Current fee is $0.19.  Thats too high for normal use. Which is exactly why I’m not using it. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 09:10:23
Problem is it will cost him a $600 transaction fee to move that $500 by then ;)
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:25:21
Annnnd.... its gone.

Have you heard about our lord and savior?
@_date: 2018-06-02 06:42:58
People that are “dirt poor” probably wont be stoked to pay a weeks salary in transaction fees I would imagine. 
I think that fees are the single largest threat to acceptance by consumers in general but especially poor people where a $1 or even less fee is not an insignificant fee.  I myself continue to use visa cards because I get my cashback and no responsibilities to keep my money safe from fraud since its in visa to handle that.
If we could wven get down to .01 cent per transaction I think we would be onto something. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:32:25
We arent talking about moving significant money. We are talking about competing with visa and cash. And at the current price of Transactions and low scalability its not a competitive option. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:23:11
I have no idea because I dont use bitcoin on a daily basis like pretty much everyone else in this sub. 
But I know for a fact that even if this tiny community started using it on a regular basis the fees would snap right back into the $10-$40 range again. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:44:36
Even worse, I heard that the orignal btc code was written by only 1 dev and he was using a pseudonym!!!!  Scam!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:38:08
The fact that you haven't already told your wife is very telling.  Perhaps that's something you should think about before making any moves.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:12:05
Yeah. I dont know what the best way is.  Tangle or hashgraph based currencies seem very promising though for these types of things

When describing how bitcoin offers a solution to traditional banking online in the white paper introduction. 
“The cost of mediation (banks) increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions”
Now bitcoin cannot make small casual transactions in a practical way due to speed and fees.  Like a bank. 
Back in the early days people often discussed one of the most interesting uses for bitcoin could be micro transactions. Obviously its gone a different path, whether thats good or bad depends on your perspective. 
Not saying bitcoin needs to be low fee or that it matters what satoshi and the early users wanted it to become, it can be whatever the community wants it to be.  But clearly micro payments and peer to peer spending of trivial amounts was part of the original vision.   
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:38
The first line of the satoshi white paper “A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
Peer to peer payments was kind of the entire point from the beginning.....

I mean, miners are great and all.  But they aren't selflessly running the network for some noble cause.  They do it because they make a shitload of money doing it and they would stop very quickly if it became unprofitable to do so.
How about thanking all the new investors who bought at $7500 for keeping us early adopters from losing our gains during these volatile times.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:26:28
Bitcoin went down 1k and BCC went up 1k.... whats the issue.  if you're a HODLer you have both so you lost nothing.  If you tried to get clever and sold all your BCC for $300 then yeah, you just lost the last few weeks of gains but are still up overall.  Wasn't bitcoin like $400 a year ago?  dropping to 6k is hardly endtimes.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:12:49
10k nothing, if they keep generating USDT at the rate they are they could pump bitcoin to 20k before years end!
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:08:34
I don't understand the point of the 2x fork in the first place.  doubling the blocksize is not a big enough addition of transactions per block to be worth the hassle and risk in my opinion.  Bitcoin needs a more clever or larger scaling solution if it is ever going to fulfill the original vision of micro transactions or being a common currency.  There are tons of altcoins capable of higher volume than 2x or even BCC provides, why not cherry pick the best solution out of the altcoin testing grounds?
These miniscule upgrades aren't really going to do much and fragment the community and cause hassle for users and companies.  I'm not even remotely sure what the best course of action is here, but I do know that the additional blocksize will be filled up almost immediately and put us back where we are now.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:36:50
Yeah I know. So why pay that higher price that accounts for cc fees and get a btc fee as well. Unless they offer a discount for btc purchases youre paying more. 
The prices at the grocery store are marked up for cc as well. But using cash doesnt get me a discount. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:54:52
If I used bitcoin for every transaction I make, in a week I'll probably have paid $100 or more in fees.  VS using my credit card that gave me 1.5% in cashback....
So yeah, I'll not be doing that thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-23 17:26:24
I dont personally think bitcoin is worh more or less because of the fees. Look at the value, its higher than ever and so are the fees. But bitcoins value as a means of exchange is very poor, the fees make small transactions impractical until an update happens. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:05:28
This is how i do it as well. Lowest fees and instant buys. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 06:35:33
I've seen people say in various forums and on here that well fargo closed their account for making large transfers to and from coinbase or other exchanges.  Personally I have only used capitol one the last 4 years with coinbase and gemeni with no issues.  
I would recommend just opening an account with capitolone 360 or something.  Plus.... why are you using wells fargo anyways they suck.

Just curious what the point of using this over a normal card is?  It looks like you paid fees to make the transaction while a normal credit card would have paid you some cashback or points.
What is the incentive to use this other than just the novelty of using blockchain?
