For the question about Satoshi and general information on where the 21 Million Bitcoins currently exist. You can find the answer here:  
For the rest of your it. I’d like to believe that bitcoin has the potential for a single global currency that could escape governmental regulations but I say that with a deep sense of skepticism in reality and the optimism for a utopian future. 
The fact is that once there’s enough value to something, someone will have enough to influence it; and, if a few people do there will be people/governments with more authority over them to influence them and the cycle goes on. I look at bitcoins as an investment. I’ve made some money and that’s good. I’ll hold as well but not enough for it to directly effect me now. 
An example of why Bitcoin is a more than a little volatile can be observed If you look at the market for bitcoin now, not only had it fallen from $19,700 but it has done so because of a massive sell-wall. The fact remains that it has potential, a lot of potential but I doubt it will manifest into something super concrete in our lifetime, if it does at all.

If you look at the dips in the past, i.e. May, September, and November. The pattern works there. I know I didn’t do the best job explaining it but if you would like me to explain how I’ve noted these numbers I can give you the details, and please let me know if you do. If you have a specific question let me know and I’ll do my best to try answer that as well.

Appeal to tradition and all that. But yeah, eventually it will go back up and come out even stronger. Im on the HODL train.

It most probably will not drop at 10k specifically but it will again. I’ve only recently bought bitcoin, that was right before the September dip, and have done some research on how the drop will effect the price. From the ‘analysis’ I’ve done it will dip by around 30% or more, in the near future but as reflected from what I’ve seen from the price analysis in the year 2017, it will rise again by almost 60% from the price it is at the lowest point in the “dip period”. I’ve bought again in the November dip and have seen an increase to about 92% as of today.
Edit: the stability of price and any increase or decrease is all still subject to speculation.
