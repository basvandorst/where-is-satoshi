Curious if anyone knows any other projects going on to resolve the scale-ability problem? 
I am aware of Lightning Network, but I don't see it having a huge impact on the problems we are seeing now. Bitcoin is hardly used as a currency at this present moment, this is what Lightning Network will introduce and most transitions on that network will be for the buying and consuming of goods, rather than simply moving around your assets.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:12:03
This is the perfect timing for Lightning network to hit, with large sums of peoples wealth being in bitcoin, companies will be hard pressured into letting people purchase goods with the coin.

It literally is the definition of being duped. He wanted to buy Bitcoin but was funneled down a rabbit hole disguised as Bitcoin to buy BCash instead.
Just because he can exchange it back doesn't change the fact that he was intentionally tricked.
Different Context: If I went to buy a mini pig and was given a baby regular sized pig. Just because I can sell the adult pig later on once I realized I was scammed, doesn't mean the original seller didn't scam me by selling me a regular pig.

From the Article - James Altucher's Predictions.
BE WARNED ERECTIONS MAY INTENSIFY, MOVE AWAY FROM LOW LYING DESKS.
Here are his 10 predictions for cryptocurrencies:
    At least one country's currency is likely to fail soon — likely Argentina or Venezuela. This will lead to mass adoption of bitcoin among that populace. That will in turn lead to bitcoin rising by more than $50,000 when it happens.
    Mainstream banks will accept bitcoin, and will start offering storage and software access. They will also create cryptocurrency derivatives — as the CME is about to start doing.
    Despite the optimism, there will be a massive wipeout, and 95 percent of the alt-coins out there will go away — just like the dot-com bust. The surviving coins will go up a ton. This will happen within next four-six months.
    The U.S. government will secretly start accumulating one of the smaller cryptocurrencies to make it easier for gray-area transactions with other countries. This has already started happening but will really start to ramp up in 2018.
    China will invest heavily in another cryptocurrency, but probably not bitcoin. China will want to have a cryptocurrency that is competitive with bitcoin, but under its centralized control. This will, in general, provide legitimacy to all cryptocurrencies.
    One big problem with cryptocurrencies now is their volatility. At least one — basecoin — will likely dramatically reduce that in 2018.
    More companies will pay freelancers with crypto, which will lead to calls for tax reform. There will need to be greater regressive sales taxes, which will ultimately require government cuts and eventually less power for national governments. This is a long-term prediction.
    In the same way the internet changed the monopolistic phone industry, crypto will change the monopolization of government-backed money.
    A new government organization will be created to analyze regulation on cryptocurrencies. This will, ironically, lead to a huge upswing in bitcoin and coins that provide actual utility.
    Thousands of crypto companies will be created and go public, but only a few will be massive successes.

It's crazy that over at there is this new rhetoric that Andreas supports Bcash. Watching this it is clear to me he would see it as an attack on the decentralized nature of bitcoin. 
Right now Bcash is sitting there screaming, we are better, but all they have done is take the hard work put into Bitcoin, made a change that's increases the risk of centralization for their own benefit, at a cost for short-term scale ability. 
I personally like that this is happening. In the long-run this whole shit-storm will give people/investors more confidence in the Bitcoin developers, and will further lesson the chance of a similar attack in the future.

As far as I am aware the format Electrum uses (bech32), is generally not recognized by non-compatible exchanges. 
Taken from the announcement thread:
"What you can do with a wallet that uses these addresses:
    send to any and all wallets, exchanges and websites
    receive from other Electrum wallets version 3.0 or greater
What you cannot do with such a wallet:
    receive from most other wallets and websites simply because they consider bech32 addresses as invalid.
To use these addresses, simply create a new wallet and choose "Segwit" as the seed type in the creation wizard. "
If so I don't see the benefit of using it until my exchange of choice (only choice based on where I live) goes Segwit compatible.

I believe in Bitcoin, if it makes me rich so be it, I'm not going to have a life crisis over how it impacts people I will never see, meet or have any interaction with during my lifetime. 
If you want to sell now to save your soul the pain go right ahead. I won't be following.
You have to bear in mind that we early adopters are taking the biggest risk of them all, we are starting the revolution that will de-slave the people from the state. We risk losing a lot, if we get rewarded for the risk I personally only see it as fair. If anything people should be thanking us in the future.
Also you are acting like a sweet summer child if you think people getting rich off bitcoin is anywhere near the amount of damage the Banks have caused to people in our life times and previous, including future. War, enslavement, murder, stealing, inflation etc etc etc.

You say its counterproductive for miners to not do this, but I have to disagree completely. Short-term yes for increased profits, but at the same time they are highlighting to the whole community/developers how necessary a scaling solution is, and thus are encouraging it's eventual appearance; the end result will be reduced profits. As I see it they are being the catalyst towards these scale-able solutions. We'll see how this plays out in the long run, could be wrong.

Whales are also buying. The yin to their yang. Any selling is immediately met with a buy wall that gets topped up until the sell pressure ends. The purposeful market stalling is causing holders to sell. I see it as whales are accumulating off the back of fud, whilst also stalling the market to create said fud. Any buy pressure is being met with the same resistance. Basically if you sell now you are giving your hard held coins to market manipulators with deep pockets.

Try pay for stuff over the Internet with your paper money. Oh wait.....
Also you are naive to think that money stolen from bank accounts get refunded 100% of the time. In most cases of large theft, compromised funds are transferred to offshore bank accounts out of reach and are effectively gone forever. 
The bank isn't there to protect you through and through, but ye if some gippo steals your card details and buys warhammer from a shop online, the bank will just give you the money to shut you up or the retailer will be forced by the bank to cover the cost. Now if you lost 200k worth of funds, chances are the stealer knows what he's doing and it's gone too.
One instance of this happening at a finance company I worked for, they lost 60k from a compromised email account that lured funds to be sent to an offshore account, and do you want to know what the result was.....it vanished, no amount of efforts to get it back worked. Bare in mind this is a companies funds, not a random pleb.

@_date: 2018-05-09 15:07:08
I don't get his thinking concerning the price prediction. In his head he just assumes bitcoin adoption keeps growing and growing and more people start mining it, thus causing the price to increase relative to the cost of mining the coin. However, Bitcoin could also go the other direction with less people using bitcoin and the cost of mining decreases relative to the price of the coin. His prediction could happen but it's just as likely to not happen. 
If I said, I think the price will go up to extraordinary amounts compared to what the value is today due to the cost of mining going up overtime; wouldn't that be the same as his prediction? Just less specific on numbers. 
Seems like a pretty weak argument. If my thinking is backwards, let me know.

Thanks for showing me that subreddit I'll probably look into it in the future. I'm long term holding and have been for around a year, not looking to change that anytime soon. Right now I'm just happy holding my own keys.

Last I tried this Revolut wouldn't allow me to make the transfer due to it's restrictions with Coinbase. Unless it changed since then.

About time, us UK boys don't have a lot of choice. Still waiting for GDAX to allow me to verify with them though.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:13:06
I haven't checked Coinbase Pro. The problem with GDAX is you need two verifications of identity. Coinbase only needs one. For me GDAX doesn't give me an additional verification method, it's passport and apply for institutional account only. There is absolutely no way for me to get my GDAX account verified at this moment.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:10:22
For me they don't even let give me two options for verification (one isn't enough for GDAX) I have passport only which I've done. Only other option is the application for an institutional account.
Sent an email to support multiple times. I just get a copy pasted email back which has nothing to do with my query. Literally the shittest customer support I've ever seen in a company.
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:10:42
Interesting, I'll keep it mind if I plan to use Coinbase again. I'd rather they just let me verify for GDAX or Coinbase Pro than go through more middle men. Thanks for the help though.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:38:07
Yep, I've used Coinbase in the past. After a few months I decided the fee weren't worth it and I managed to get something going with CoinFloor. Coinfloor decided to stop helping the little people though and now is targeting whales. Massive minimum deposits etc. So I am back to looking for an option. Not in a rush though.

Just remembered this one person, granted he was one of the most elderly employees at this law firm, but he would fail to input his password every morning, causing him to lock himself out of his account. It wasn't an issue of him forgetting it, which maybe understandable, he would just enter it wrong. Even when given a new password he would still lock himself out. It took someone to go to his desk and type the password in for him nearly every morning. Still not sure how he did any work on the PC.

(' ')/ add another to the list. Getting started, saw the decline of 2x and put $200 on the $7800 train, that was a depressing day lol. Hard lesson but now I am a man that lives in the trenches surrounding myself with dip fever! Managed to get in on the dip today with $150, hopefully pays off.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:49:27
"I imagine the people who sell are hoping to buy back in at the bottom" Jesus if that's the case, I commend them on their balls of steel lol.
Much safer to buy in the dip and just wait for it to go a couple hundred above the price you bought in. Could be aday, could be a week. Doesn't really matter as long as there isn't a huge crash. Personally not much risk at all, as long as you are willing to wait if things go a little wrong. 
Then again I'm not a day trader, just someone looking to make some easy cash.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:56:39
Even a -4% with large sums of money can get you an easy couple thousand once it goes back up. Personally 1 night of trading could net me a months wage tax free, and I'm currently unemployed. I just don't have the money in the exchange this weekend. 
This is just me though, I really don't know much about the other coins to be confident in going into trading with them.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:34:39

No one really knows dude, I was thinking the same thing for my last 1k to put in, I went in at 6200 euros, its now 6440. It could tank in 5 mins, it could continue rising over the course of the week. No one can tell you whats going to happen. You could either regret not going in now because it will only be more expensive to buy the same amount of BTC or be the one cheering in hindsight because it dips really low in the coming days.

Ye I can't see it as that difficult to control, the tax system is a machine that can adapt. If companies paid to our wallet addresses, the government would have this information and they could easily cross reference the blockchain. The information is readily available for them to investigate.

Can't unfortunately, based on my location (I presume) Island off the coast of France, the only verification options given are Passport (Done) and create a business account (Can't). Need two verification's to use gdax. I'm not even going to try to contact Coinbase about it, knowing how bad the support is from reading stuff here.

Good advice, thank you. I'm a ballsy person so alittle realback is good for me to hear. Ye I definitly feel my thoughts are from a overzelious confidence on this particular dip. 
'If it was easy everyone would be doing it and there’d be a whole lot more millionaires in the world.' True, but even a couple thousand here and there would be nice ;).
God had I had my money in an exchange I would of gone in with around 25k at £6000 tonight. I'm going to pretend I did, lets see if pretend me fails or succeeds on this dip.

Kinda sad and also amusing just thinking about this being apart of the reality when it comes to the coin dips. In essence confident traders are sucking up free money from the newer, easily spooked buyers. Then a whole group of new buyers join the party and the cycle repeats.

Just so you see this, I posted it under someone else as a reply.
Generate a paperwallet. Print it out, then encrypt it with a password.
Use a password you have used in the past for so long you would possibly never forget it, but also one you aren't using now. Encrypt the paper wallet with that, print out the unencrpyted wallet for safe keeping. Now if you ever want to have your private address on your hard drives backuped etc. You can use the encrpyted version, thus making sure that if anyone did hack your computer they still won't have your your de-encrypted wallet information. Make sure to password or encypt any documents with the information concerning your encrypted paper wallet.
In my opinion it's the best of both worlds, if you ever did forget the password you will still have the physical un-encypted wallet information and now you can store the encrypted details on harddrives. The more backups the better.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:46:02
I'd do the same if I was 100% confident the whole thing doesn't crash. We can never be to sure. Fiat money is much safer at the moment (based on the country I live in).

Do you have a password you have used in the past for so long you would possibly never forget it. Encrypt the paper wallet with that, print out the unencrpyted wallet for safe keeping like the post above said. Now if you ever want to have your private address on your hard drives backuped etc. You can use the encrpyted version, thus making sure that if anyone did hack your computer they still won't have your your de-encrypted wallet information. Make sure to password or encypt any documents with the information concerning your encrypted paper wallet.

? I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:52:10
I guess, that fear is always there, but today I can't see anything news wise that would cause a crash, so this fear shouldn't be at a forefront of sellers decisions today. Well that's my opinion. If anything Bitcoin is only getting more popular.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:04:57
Doesn't make sense, Bitcoin's success if largely based on adoption. If he wanted Bitcoin to succeed he would be talking highly of it. The problem I see here is these rich investors looking at Bitcoin as a stock, rather than understanding how important and revolutionary the technology is. I'm hoping I'd never have to convert my coins, going back to the fiat banking system would be a failer in my eyes. We will see though, in theory you can still reep the rewards of being an early adopter without going back to fiat, it just depends on how widely used bitcoin is as a currency.

It would have to be well orchestrated between the many whales for this to be possible. I don't see it happening because the risk of it failing would lead to big losses. One whale won't have a big enough impact. Who knows though, the big players that pumped BCH may be able to repeat what they did this time around.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:13:29
I understand where you are coming from but a 100k loan is different to putting in 50k of your own money and waiting for a couple hundred increase in value over however long it takes.
~~I don't see it as hindsight~~, as I was writing this the price was around £6000, had my money been in the exchange I would of bought in. Now £6500 in the next week or month? I can see it, even if it doesn't no harm in holding longer until it does.
Unless there was some major news to imply an incoming crash or even a low probability, then I would not be buying as the risk has increased substantially. 
Edit: Fuck it, I guess it is looking back in hindsight. I'm not even sure what I was getting at there. Probably just over confident about the future valuation.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:33:53
Not exactly, if a person did what Iambored mentioned then buys in again at 8k after making 2k from their last trade, then when it goes back to 11k as you mentioned he would of made another 3k on top of his 2k. So instead now he has made 5k profit, rather than 3k holding.

Well if bitcoin was mass adopted to the extent where I could buy coffee from the majority of store locations, personally I would probably have most of my assets in bitcoin. Meaning some of it would be for general buying/selling and some of it I would keep for savings. Same as with a normal bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:09:49
Maybe I'm naive, but looking at what's happening and has happened in the coins value. Even if you were willing to wait half a year in the instance it all goes tits up, Bitcoin won't go up by £400 in price in that time, also taking into account the buyer bought on a clear dip? Sure it may not, but the odds are heavily against it. To me it's low risk.

I used  to create my wallet, make sure to download the zip file rather than use the online version. Download the zip from GitHub, make sure your computer is not connected to the internet and has no viruses and then generate the wallet, then it's simply a click and an input box to get the encrypted version of the wallet. You can then use the program in the future to decrypt.

If I was you and concerned I'd put in a quarter or half the maount you wish to put in now, then save the other half for a dip. Then at least you won't lose out big time either way. However, it all doesn't really matter if you aren't a day trader, just hold it and wait it all out and cash in far down the line from now.
