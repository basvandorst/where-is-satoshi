So if you are a day trader with $100k (25 btc) you have to pay $150 for every trade. If you are flipping those 25 btc 10 times a day, that means that now you have to pay Coinbase $1500 a day! That's $45000 a month! You can forget about any profit (unless you are some kind of genius and doubleing your money every month).
OK, after a month your trading volume would be 30M and your fee would be $50 per transaction ($500 per day and $15000 month).
Of course, if you are institution and you easily have $50M monthly trafic, than your fee is still 0 and you no longer have compentition from small market makers - which means you'll have even bigger profit margin and even bigger trading volume).
So, unless you are big, you can go scr.. yourself.

Yes they are and that's all fine. 
But compare two persons that just started to trade. Person A started a month ago and has 50M trafic (very easy to achive with 100k - 20 trades a day will do it).
Person B started trading today and has 0M tarfic.
If person A and person B have exact amount of money and are doing exactly the samo things - person B has to pay Coinbase $45000 for the first month while person A doesn't have to pay a thing.
So person A and B are identical in every way and they are doing the same thing at the same time yet person B will be bancrupt in 2-3 months while A will be swiming in money. 
I think they should reset the trading volume for everybody just to make things even. Even then, institution with 10 million can achive 0% trading fee with just 5 trades. First trade will cost them $12000 (aprox) and other 4 will cost them $20000. After that they have 0% fee. Total fee they paid is $32000 on $50 000 000 trafic (0.06% one time fee). 
You try to do that with 100k or less and you will be broke.
So - it is just abusing the little people.

But it was short-lived...
It did drop bitcon $300 on Gdax in the last half an hour.

People, I neeeed to buy - please get off Conibase. PLEASE!!! 
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:32:15
OK, now they corrected it (after an hour). As you can see, candle is disconected (but on refresh it will look ok):
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:32:38
Business as usual. It will soon be back up. Corrections are not what they've used to be - they are getting shorter and shorter and with a smaller dip. 32000 new Coinbase users per day are driving the price up so I wouldn't recomend daily trading even though it looks like a great oportunitiy to buy low and sell high. Most of the times "sell high" is actually low point and price goes up even higher and you end up regretting selling... It's difficult to time the market and it's been proven many times that to maximize the profit the best thing to do is to hold... But, if you have the time to stare at candle graph whole day it can be fun to try daily trading...

Ignore - I tought that they will take "snapshoted" state from the announcement date and them move on from there, but instead they will fork with the block 491407 which is due in a few hours.

Bitcoin was artificially inflated in the last month and a half. FOMO didn't happened as whales expected (very little new retail penetration).  This is why this whale bailed out. 3 parabolic rises by whales all followed by side trading and no momentum. The only way to screw up the whales that inflated the market is to sell before they do (and then buy after another one bails out).
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:50:15
Supposedly retail isn't behind this kind of trading, but institutions/whales trading sideways ... I don't know, I would rather see small incremental growth instead of this jumpy insecure mess.
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:06:15
What are you talking about. That pump from last month (April 4) was also from one user - coordinated scripted buy.
Whales are playing, that is all. I don't see anyone taking bitcoin seriously and reaching new ATH when it is all fake. Regular small guys are mostly trading sideways with small but steady BTC increase. All the big moves come from the whales. This will draw away adoption. I wonder how long they'll manage to do this before everyone gets tired of it.
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:06:27
One person dropped the market by 20%. I wouldn't be too happy about that.
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:21:44
Fair point. I stand corrected: "we are all just plankton"
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:01:36


The sad thing is, this time whales are practically the only ones that are deciding what will happen. There is not much retail money coming in (like before). Those 2-3 pumps in the last few weeks were done by individuals. Just like this morning's dump.
Also, people that waited year and a half have finally recovered their losses so they sold in a last few day.
I'm looking at it this way: in the last few weeks, I've earned 150+% gain. That's freaking great. On the other side, even if bitcoin reaches $10 000, that is only 25% more gain - not worth the risk.
@_date: 2019-05-17 06:44:24
Problem is that it completely depends on whales. We, regular people are keeping the price stable (+ small sustained growth) and then few whales rise the price 100% over a few days. Then they drop it. It's ridiculous  - just a playground for whales. And you can't fight them - exchanges have to have an order book, and when it is nice and tightly packed, whales come in screw the little man. Rinse and repeat - supper rich getting richer, poor getting poorer.  The same thing like the regular economy. The only way it wouldn't work for the whales is if the order book is always equally packed on both sides and there is no FOMO or FUD to drive the price momentum. But that defies all purpose of the market. So - forget about it. Cash out, maybe wait to get back in when it is really low. Just make sure that you make a profit and don't get greedy. I cashed out a few days ago - after a 100+% increase so it's been nice to me :) I don't know if I'll go back in again - not until it's really low. I can wait it out, even if I miss the new ATH - profit is a profit.

Few whales pumped the price from 3500 to 8500 (150%). Now one dropped it by 20% in a few minutes. All relevant movements comes from whales. When retail is trading, market is generally stable (+/- few pct). We can hardly call this a "market" anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:24:05
Yep, it's all manipulated.
I think they anticipated that the FOMO will happen and then they can sell when the price gets much higher, but no relevant movement happened except for their moves. Hardly no new retail money coming in. After every of their pumps the market just traded sideways - so no actual momentum was gained. I guess that this one whale saw that it isn't working and bailed out.
So, do we sell before whales give up? Do we wait? What do we do?
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:38:16
A lot of youtubers announced this yesterday. Bastards, it's all their fault :)
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:09:46
And by one person.
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:08:43
I don't like the fact that one person can drop the market by 20% (and few others pump it to 150+%).
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:45:06
Few whales are basically controlling entire market. When one person can drop the price of BTC 20% in a few minutes you know it's not good (or pump it to +150% in a few days). Institutions don't like this, little people don't like this. Whales are playing a game and we are all just sheep.
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:12:44
Actually, I find it more worrying that one guy can make this happen (just like last month's pump from 3600 to 4600). Forget ATH when it all mostly depends on a few individuals.
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:41:50
It is a sad thing when few people can manipulate the market this much. Can we even call it a market? Nobody will trust bitcoin because of this. Not the institutions, not the little people. Only whales.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:10:49
True true. The sad thing is, all you have to do is listen to the news about big amounts of crypto being transferred on exchanges. It says it all.  You know that you can expect a sudden drop in a few days. Unfortunately, you won't hear about big sums of money being transferred because that's private, but the former information is more important anyways.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:13:47
No longer true. Now the maker fee is 0.15% so be careful.
@_date: 2019-05-17 11:50:28
I got out a few days ago so it's been good to me. But this kind of manipulation leaves bad taste. I would rather take FOMO and FUD from millions of users than a whim of a single user.
