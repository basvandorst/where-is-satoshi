Even if BTC becomes very popular, I don't think credit cards are going away anytime soon.

Read the article. It started at 2% per day at the turn of 2014, while hitting 0.5% a day today.

If a million people mined with their cereal mining chips, it may cost each of them $25 dollars in electricity but it would make centralized industrial mining unprofitable.

They do I believe. Isn't it 1% off for Club O members?

Bitcoin mining grew 30x, 3000% growth in 2014.

It's the tenth time they're better than random where they make bank.

Find someone to send money to via paypal. If you sent it to them not as a purchase, I don't think there are any fees. If you can find someone you can trust, they could send you the Bitcoin.

Haha, since we're Bitcoin miners we practically have the local PUD breathing down our neck to make sure we're doing things correctly.
They're on red alert since another mine in a county next to us that will go unnamed caused 40% distortion on the power lines, which probably could blow up your neighbors transformer.

I'd grab an S5 or an SP20. There's a deal now where you can get two SP20's for $1k.
Then send them to a hosting service, like [ASICSPACE](

Sure, if you just want to play around.

I wasn't being literal about a million.
What I'm saying is that home miners have things that industrial mines don't. Home miners don't have to pay for network engineers, maintenance time, the capital cost of electrical intrastructure, etc.
As long as a home miner is willing to accept some loss on electricity, then that cost comes directly from industrial mines bottom line as mining is a zero sum game.

This is what happens when you cloud mine.
Consider miner hosting instead.
Instead of buying fictitious cloud hash, you can own a miner in a datacenter instead.

At least get the blockchain addon.

Couldn't you have a financial institution like a bank hold your BTC. The bank could assume responsibility for the BTC and protect them from theft with insurance, and there could be 2FA or biometrics to make sure when you access your account that it's really you.

The question you need to honestly ask yourself if you want to answer this question is "What gives Bitcoin its value?" Can you answer this question?
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:55:09
I think you missed my point.

Create a clean partition on your harddrive and throw linux mint + electrum on it. Keep it safe with a password you will remember. Encrypt the electrum seed and upload it to a usb and the cloud in case your partition crashes.

Strange. I had a transaction that was supposed to arrive today and the exact same thing occurred.

Actually you don't own any of your money. You've just borrowed it from the Fed.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:05:54
It doesn't mean Fed 2.0. It just means there is a free market in currencies.

Bitcoin ----&gt; Gold ------&gt; Cash
No taxes ;)
