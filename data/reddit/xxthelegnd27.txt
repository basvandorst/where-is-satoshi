@_date: 2018-01-06 12:50:57
Yeah, some great bullish news definitely wouldn’t hurt

Yeah, I guess. My portfolio contains of BTC, ETH and LTC, but almost 80 % are Bitcoin, because I truly belive in it and for me is the safest option of the cryptos

My prediction is that the price will be stable at 16,3 - 16,5 over the weekend, but will reach 19K probably during the next week.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:30:10
To be fair, it’s not an illusion. Remember earlier this week Paypal founder and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel invested heavily in Bitcoin, causing the price rising up 1500 dollars from 13 500 to 15 000. And no, it’s not only driven by news. I have never said that 
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:18:21
Seriously, my heart literally stopped for a second or two. The moment I saw this meme I got that picture in my head the price was dropping below 10 K. Not cool

Pardon me and excuse the shit out of my god damn french, but is this a meme or not?
