Aluminum, notably, was worth more than gold - twice as much in the 1850's.

"... pay for the services of their high class London escort in a discrete manner."
*sigh*  It's "discreet," not "discrete."  Two different things.  I hate seeing that.

oh, sure, you're right, I just did it because I've got an automatic buy set up for $10/day that I plan to do for the next five years - aside from my other investing, it's a special fund for a specific purpose at the end of that span.  I was curious to see what it would have looked like if I had done it over the last five years.  The lesson is that I would probably have freaked out and sold in 2013, and I would have done almost as well if I had just put the cash elsewhere and bought in 2014ish.
But I was curious, and I didn't see any tools online to figure this out, so I whipped it up in a spreadsheet for my own amusement.

Of course, absolutely right, that's part of the point of this chart, I can see from it that it's not that simple.  For the purposes of this particular fund, if I break even with fiat I'll still have enough money for my purpose, and if it goes to zero, I won't miss $10/day.  It's just a "what-if" and the rear view isn't as rosy as I had hoped.
At the moment, most of the rest of my holdings are in ether, and I expect that will change over time as circumstances change.  I just finished getting out of debt a couple of months ago (yay!) and am attempting to stack the proverbial cheddar.

ok, whoops, the data set I imported was for every OTHER day, will upload proper version
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:59:34
Corrected from my previous post - the dataset actually was price for every OTHER day, so I just changed it to $20 every other day which ought to be about the same.  Graph looks the same, but the numbers are twice as big.  Oops.

derp you might be right, my data might be bad...
shit, I think the csv I imported is every other day.  Dammit
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:18:57
Dunno, you tell me 
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:32:00
inspiration is that a year ago, I had 12 bitcoins and someone did something that made me have to cash it all out...  This fund is for revenge on that person five years from now, or if they apologize, to go have some fun with them.  Either way, $10/day for five years will be enough.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:01:56
Still might not be quite right, but you get the general idea, would be nice if someone could make a more authoritative graph of this.

I'm paying 15¢/day in fees now, so that's like ~$5/month.  What would it have been over the last five years, no idea.  I'm ignoring that.  But if it was similar, well, 5 times 365 times .15 = $273, subtracted from the $200k.

sorry, bad input data, will fix and do it again
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:16:53
of course, obviously, it would have been much better to buy it all on day one...  
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:37:25
or does someone else know a tool to figure this out?  I was just putzing around with a spreadsheet
