Are you saying that because Google Sheets is on the cloud?

Not sure why you're getting downvoted, that makes complete sense. You have to adjust the timescale for Crypto, but the human behavior that acts irrationally is constant from asset class to asset class.

Ver's ridiculous criticism has only served to help Andreas. Oh the sweet irony.

I agree. I think a block size increase at this point is a lot of immediate relief for a fairly small concession. Too many people are blinded by the partisan POV of Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash and aren't even considering it. Why not? Because it won't solve all problems forever? Nothing would ever be done if we applied that standard. Don't let good be the enemy of perfect.

Publishers aren't customers. Publishers are Google's business partners — they get a cut of the revenue for ads displays. They pay Google zero money, Google pays them a cut. And yes, if you're big enough, you get a dedicated account manager that you can call and complain when something goes wrong. Of course, most sites don't grow to that size and don't qualify for that level of support, but that just speaks to the scale of the internet and the online advertising business in general. You have every right to complain about that if you want, but we'll need to make a massive change to how we fund content creation and platforms on the internet (including companies like Reddit).
But we're off topic. This started about an ad on Google search, which is obviously an owned and operated property, no publishers involved. Just someone who paid for it, and Google's automated systems that approved it. As I said before, I agree they should have caught this. It's blatant fraud. I'm illustrating WHY they didn't catch it, and that's due to the scale at which they operate. You could hire 100k people that ONLY review ad creatives and you still wouldn't make a dent in the number of unscrupulous ads. There isn't a malicious plan to deprive people of customer service going on. It's a scaling issue.

Good thread folks. Glad to see maturity in the midst of the usual BS.

ITT: people not understanding how online advertising works, thinking Google itself is serving this ad /facepalm

Good man. Priorities bro, and you have them straight.

This is all the way wrong. They have literally thousands of people whose only job is to respond to customer concerns and help optimize ad strategy. They also have an ad network that serves hundreds of millions of ad creatives all over the world. They have algorithms that block bad actors but it's impossible to catch every one, especially in such a non regulated space like crypto. I agree they could and should do better here, but your conspiracy theory is wildly inaccurate.

Same could be said about the "Bitcoin is at $X price" or the rollercoaster memes. I hear your point, but there is a whole lot of recycled content on this sub.
