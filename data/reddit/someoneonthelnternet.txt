His analogy is kind of dumb though.
Those soldiers that protect the castle with all the money flowing to them would bulk up and become  terminators (akin to miners having tons of money coming into them from all the fees). So they'll be able to secure a castle of any size, since the more people living in said castle, the more fees the soldiers (miners) earn.
If the miners would start losing money, they'd increase the fees - and therefore stay in business, thereby the network self regulating.

So that more merchants want to start accepting bitcoin. It costs them less. If everyone kept using dollars then nobody would take bitcoin. Chicken and egg problem. Gotta use it for more to accept it so in the future we wont have to use dollars at all.

Bitcoin IS easier. But not many people know this yet. And if us early adopters don't use it then the masses won't either.

But we're computer literate nerd types, PayPal isn't for us anyway. The masses still use it and it would get Bitcoin mainstream if PayPal made it super easy to buy/trade/sell with Bitcoin since the newbies wouldnt have to learn anything new to start using it right within paypal.

I hope you realize that there's billions of other people who have no access to banking at all. Hell, people in your country if they are poor cant get bank accounts and have to rely on check cashing places to deposit checks. Also, lots of people still pay for bank accounts even in first world countries, me included as there's no other free alternative.

But the chance of Bitcoin going up 1000x is way way way waaaay higher than you generating an address collision. 
It's actually low but probable chance. I mean look at the last 2 years... It's up nearly 1000x since then. It was $1 during late 2011.

I love how this is "too hard" but waiting in line at the bank, only going there during business hours, waiting weeks for checks to clear, having to jump through hoops just to open an account, pay them monthly fees, etc is normal, easy and ok.

Really? You don't see a need for decentralized payments? Did you know that poor people in the US are unable to even get bank accounts? They have to cash their checks at check cashing places that take 1-2%. With bitcoin this problem does not exist. 
We use expensive services like Western union and bank transfers that steal a large % of our money. Something bitcoin would do faster/cheaper. 
We have to store our money in banks for which we pay a monthly fee (yes some offer free banking, but most do not, I have to pay $5 every month) With bitcoin, again, free money storage. 
Bitcoin will also allow many people in the third world to participate in global commerce.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:01:15
That's like saying "those billions of people don't need the internet or email". How do you know they don't need banking? Why do you need banking and they do not? We have no idea what the future holds. 
I don't have blind optimism, I just see the enormous potential of crypto currencies. Doesn't have to be Bitcoin.

Well the whole aim of Bitcoin is to hopefully replace fiat currencies, or be so ingrained that people can opt to use $ or bitcoin wherever they are. If that does happen, people could choose to be paid in Bitcoin, stores would accept bitcoin, etc. 
Banks in the future can actually hold bitcoins for you. They are already holding all their fiat on computers. I haven't set foot in a branch in months. So this is perfect for people who would prefer to pay the bank a monthly fee to store their coins safely, and others who want to save some money could simply use their computers/devices to do so. Something not possible right now.

Or they can just use an alt coin like eth without needing to use a centralized off chain provider...
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:00:56


Well this has been eroding already, bitcoin is down to less than 50% market cap. Lots of people are bailing. Why would someone pay insane fees and wait for hours and hours when they can just use some alt coin that confirms in seconds and costs pennies?
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:07:55
Lets say there will be apps that do all this crap, but then why would people still use bitcoin when it will rely on a centralized third party (segwit/lightning network) to help with transaction processing? Why not just set up an eth/ltc wallet and send money without any of this.
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:29:01
I actually used eth for a few transactions yesterday, and paid a few cents.

Except when there are easier alternatives, nobody will use clunky Bitcoin.
