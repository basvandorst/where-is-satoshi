I think we've all been there. Which is why I was in tears by the end of the bit.

Why doesn't Mt Gox just take Paypal? I'm sure it's been asked before, but I want to know why Mt Gox only does transactions through obscure pain-in-the-ass "Internet Money!" websites.

To clarify, I understand the whole concept of bitcoins and their creation, but I'm a little unclear on what programs to use and how to specifically finagle my computer to optimize their creation.

That's the same sentiment that turned me off from r/anticonsumption.
"Oh cool, maybe I'll find tips on how to reduce my spending and consumption, and possibly learn to create more useful things myself! Neato!" 
And then I find that half of the posts are about anti-capitalism and evil greedy corporations. Yeah, I nope'd my way out of that dribble real quick.
