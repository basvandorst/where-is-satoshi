Nobody would want to use gold as a medium of exchange because, again, it is highly impractical in that regard. It's essentially unfit to be a medium of exchange in today's world. 


Exactly. That's what I meant by putting it in a bank vault and hoping that some other guy will come along in the future to buy it from you, just to put it in a different vault. 
And the gold standard was only "useful" because it effectively limited the amount of money that could be printed. The only attribute of gold that made this possible is that it's scarce enough.

Anecdotal and lurid ("tens of thousands").
Also, if companies such as Coinbase are committed to it, then they obviously value the additional benefit of being able to accept zeroconf transaction enough to deal with the occasional double-spend attempt. Why do you want to take this choice away from them?

Are there any statistics that suggest that such double-spending attempts are being made in a way that they would be problematic enough to warrant a patch that makes zeroconf transactions entirely worthless?
If I don't trust the sender, then I can already wait for x confirmations. This patch doesn't change anything about that. What it does however is that it forces me to wait for at least 1 confirmation when I'm not entirely sure if I want to trust the sender, whereas now I could always consider the fact that double spending is neither effortless nor reliable in such a situation.

I am now fully convinced that you actually do not understand the economic principles behind Bitcoin and the various monetary incentives that power its ecosystem. Which is a little bit sad to be honest.
I am also convinced now that the reason for your failure to understand the dynamics behind all of this is rooted in your irrational obsession over the aspect of speculation in the Bitcoin space, even though you just demonstrated that speculation is inherent to pretty much everything that has value (such as gold and stocks), and simply can not be separated from it. 
To reply to some of your points:


Ignoring your sensationalistic numbers and wording, this is essentially what happens in an economy. Any economy. It's a fundamental principle of how our society works. This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, other than the fact that Bitcoin is a part of this world.
You are still not acknowledging my argument that these evil salesmen are instrumental in enabling Bitcoin to have value in the first place, before it can finally derive its value from the utility it provides. It's really not that hard to understand?
Bottom line here is: Speculation is not a bad thing per se. Just because there are people taking advantage of other people, everywhere, in every aspect of our lives, doesn't mean that speculation itself is the devil. It's just a tool. A necessary tool, that can and will be abused, just like any other tool. Decrying Bitcoin because it also enables speculation is as close minded as it gets.


It seems to me you still don't understand that it can't just be "a world's currency" because you or whoever else thinks it should be. It needs to have value first!!!!! Scarcity enables it to gain speculative value which enables it to be a currency!!!!!! Your utopian ideas where speculation doesn't happen won't work in this world and this reality!!!!!! I'm seriously running out of exclamation marks here, trying to get this point across to you.
The rest of your comment makes me feel like I'm reading it's so full of fallacies, misconceptions, faulty assumptions and plain old ignorance. Sorry to say this, but I'm getting tired of this discussion now. It has been interesting and entertaining for a while, but now it has become only aggravating. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:00:08
I only read the part in caps but that was enough to give you an upvote :)
Edit: Ok I read the rest of it, even though it wasn't very readable.
The main conclusion here is that the current payment processors are the result of inefficient structures built on complex regulations built on wonky fundamentals supported by what we call a monetary system. It's no surprise that these buildings are really fucking ugly from the perspective of a user. And it's not entirely their builders fault, because there's only so much you can do when you're trying to build tree house with rotten wood on a hollow tree that's growing from a swamp.
The good news is indeed that Bitcoin doesn't care all that much about all that and does its own thing, for better and worse.

No, sorry. Also note that I'm not saying that the institutional demand is what would cause the price increase (that remains to be seen), but the anticipation hype after the announcement of the ETF.

@_date: 2015-06-03 15:26:27
Man do I hate these silly quote wars, but here we go...


I don't have to admit anything. All I'm doing is looking at facts and attempt to come to a meaningful conclusion by doing so. Speaking of which, I have no idea how you came to THAT conclusion!
What I was saying is that the phases of biggest growth in the user base are to be expected during periods of price bubbles and media hype, and not during phases in which the price is collapsing and the media is declaring bitcoin dead every other week. 
That said, adoption doesn't simply mean "omg everyone is using it now!". Adoption is a multi-faceted process, including regulatory adoption (see Lawsky or Ecurex in Switerland, etc), adoption from merchatns (see Dell, Microsoft, etc) as well as adoption from technological leaders (see IBM, Nasdaq, etc). 
All of the pieces above slowly but surely increase Bitcoin's utility, which, combined with its network effect, present new incentives beyond the speculative investment aspect for new users to join the system.
Adoption in this regard has been happening all over the place, despite the counter-indicative decline in market price.


Do I really have to go back to absolute zero every time I have a discussion with someone of "your kind"? Like seriously? Is this really necessary?
Anyway, according to your logic, gold should be worth a tiny fraction of its current market value, because it really isn't good for much. The only real application is in electronics, and the tons of tons of gold lying around in bank vaults are more than enough to cover that demand for the next millenium.
But the thing is, this isn't even a good comparison for Bitcoin! Because unlike gold, Bitcoin is not only scarce, it comes with attributes that make it inherently more useful compared to other means of value storage or exchange (and no, I'm not going back to absolute zero here in order to explain to you what makes Bitcoin differ from gold. Educate yourself, Stolfi!), which give it value beyond the aspect of speculation.
The rest of your argument pretty much falls apart from here, because it is based on the wrong assumption that Bitcoin's value is solely derived from speculation. If you believe that, then so be it, and this discussion ends here.

Yeah I can see what you're getting at. But there's probably some game theoretic aspects that need to be considered here, because it would almost be a "generational contract" between present and future miners. There's probably various ways how this could be abused that are not very obvious at first.
Anyway, maybe you can work out the dynamics this would introduce a bit more to figure out whether it is a viable solution. But on the other hand, this might become entirely moot if transaction volume scales up enough in the future so that fees are more than enough to secure the network.

This is simply not true. Right now, double spending is not trivial for most users. It might be trivial in a technical sense, but it's far from that in a practical sense. And even then there's always a trade-off between effort of doing so and risk of not succeeding.
Introducing your proposed RBF patch however *does* make it trivial for anyone to double spend **with 100% probability**, at least as soon as the first wallets support RBF.

1. Why exactly is the fact that the Bitcoin network "consumes" energy a problem? It would only be a problem if the level of energy consumption by the Bitcoin network would have a negative impact that is not being offset by the generated benefit. Energy consumption per so is not a problem, because energy that is not "consumed" is essentially useless.
2. Yes. Again, why is that a problem? It's actually a very elegant self-regulating mechanism that ensures that the Bitcoin network only consumes as much energy as is justified by its relevance for society, which is expressed (at least as an approximation) in the value or price of a Bitcoin. Which means that the assumption under point 1, that its negative impact should at least be offset by its generated benefit is always true.
3. Same as point 2.
4. It doesn't matter how much energy traditional systems consume or not. The question that matters is whether the additional benefit generated by the Bitcoin network justifies its energy consumption. The short answer as given above is that this should be true. The long answer would be to show how market mechanisms for the allocation of the scarce ressource that is energy make sure that only as much energy will be allocated to the Bitcoin network as is justified by its perceived added value.
5. This is one of the many misconceptions that are hard to eradicate from the hivemind: A transaction doesn't have a certain cost associated to it, neither a cost derived from the block reward, nor an energy cost. The cost you are talking about is the cost to ensure the integrity and the security of the network, and it is independent of the number of transactions (for now at least). 
6. Sure. Proof-of-Work is just that: Proof of energy conversion. And that's what it's supposed to be. Whether this is done by CPUs, GPUs, or ASICs really doesn't matter at all. ASIC-resistancy is just a fancy marketing scheme incorporated by some altcoins, nothing more. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 09:15:00
If anything, gold is hugely overvalued. It has almost no practical utility other than storing it in a bank vault and letting it collect a whole lot of dust while hoping that some time in the future someone else will buy it from you, so they can put it in their own bank vault and let it collect some more dust.
Its use in electronics does not justify its current valuation in the slightest.

But recognizing that makes me also question your motives here: It's hard to believe that you can not see your misconceptions for what they are. And the fact that you *again* completely fail to acknowledge any of the points I made is only reinforcing my doubts regarding your sincerity in this discussion.
So after basically "moving the goalposts" during our whole argument, and consistently ignoring the essence of all my responses to your misleading arguments, you are now telling me with a straight face that the main reason you dislike Bitcoin is for its "salesmen" and their promises of riches?
I mean, come on now, are you fucking serious? 
Bitcoin is not supposed to cure humanity of its greed or any of the other deadly sins. Bitcoin is not supposed to fix everything that is wrong with the world and society. Bitcoin is instead supposed to offer a choice, an alternative to the existing systems, an improvement over the centralized structures. It's a logical step in the evolution of money. It's not going to change the people using it for what it is, money, and all the ugliness that goes along with it. In the end, all that Bitcoin really is is the lesser evil.
Anyway, have fun with your pointless crusade, Stolfi.

@_date: 2015-06-21 14:54:04
Lol no:
Lets assume that the average supply of bitcoins is 100 btc per hour, of which 50 are from the block reward. Lets also assume that the average demand per hour is only 90 btc. That means that the price will fall, because 100 btc supply &gt; 90 btc demand.
Now the halving occurs, which reduces the average supply per hour to only 75 bitcoins (25 less from the 50 before). The demand still stays the same. So now the price will rise because 90 btc demand is now &gt; 75 btc supply.
Not saying this is representative of the actual situation, just showing how you are wrong.

The buying power of bitcoin holders has gone down by something like 80% over the past 18 months. The fact that the transactional volume measured in USD is even staying somewhat constant is positively suprising considering this loss of spending power. This again is in line with the assumption that more people are now using bitcoin, but for smaller amounts of money. There aren't that many bitcoin millionaires going around buying lambos these days.

So in a way, all the praise of blockchain technology will indirectly affect the perception of Bitcoin, as it's almost always impossible to tell when these media segments or articles talk about one thing or the other. And of course that's only the layman perspective, as those "in the know" are well aware of the fact that Bitcoin is the most important and most promising blockchain out there.

And it's not supposed to generate any wealth, at least not directly. Speculative trading is an enabler. It provides liqudity to a market, it smooths out supply and demand thus providing relative stability (in mature markets), and it improves the price finding mechanism, especially in young markets. The last point is essential when it comes to the Bitcoin market. 


Again: Without speculation, Bitcoin would have been dead in the water.

Well yes, why would that be a surprise? Of course the majority of bitcoin spending happens from people who are already "in the system". It's trivially obvious and to be expected. New people are brought into the system during hype phases, and not during deflating-bubble phases. Again, trivially obvious. 
And Bitcoin's function as a payment system is only one of many aspects of its value proposition. It's not even necessarly the most important one at this stage. For most people, the speculative investment aspect is far more important, and these people don't primarily hold it to spend it, and definitely not while their investment is down in value.

The point of Bitcoin isn't to make you rich, its point is to make you independent.
Becoming rich might just be a side effect for the people who put money and effort into bootstrapping Bitcoin (aka early adopters), so the promise of riches is thus simply the incentive that gets this thing off the ground against all odds in the first place, so that ultimately the whole world can enjoy monetary independence.

Ok, here's the full quote now:
"It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realise that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance."
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:47:47
You're looking for this: @_date: 2015-06-05 09:41:33
Well, thanks for the reply. But to be totally honest here, I don't know what to think of it:
On the one hand, you seem to be a rational thinking person who is able to apply an analytic process to a situation in order to come to a conclusion. On the other hand, you're just taking a bunch of random assumptions and declare them the final truth on the matter, without questioning the validity of their underlying premises. It's really really confusing me right now.
First of all, I agree with you that gold is probably overvalued. For the record, I don't own any gold and have no intentions of every owning any. The reason simply being that it has only minimal utility to me. I can not use gold for anything, other than putting it in a vault and hoping that in the future people will still be willing to pay the same amount of money for it. It's nothing but dead weight laying around, hoping to get picked up by some other guy who wants to put his faith in dead weight. It's stupid.
Of course the reason why people actually DO value gold more than it is worth objectively is because gold has proven to fulfil its promise of a good store of value, even in the face of economic turbulences. That trust is definitely worth something, and apparently it is worth a lot to some people. Fair enough.
But none of this applies to Bitcoin: Bitcoin is only scarce because it was a design decision by its creators. There is no fundamental reason why it has to be scarce. And yet, that design decision was an absolute stroke of genius, as it allowed the Bitcoin ecosystem to bootstrap itself on the promise of future scarcity! Bitcoin doesn't work without having value. So how does something like that go from having basically no value at all, to having enough value to enable all of the use cases we are talking about today? The answer here is pretty easy: Speculation on its future potential and future value!
So the bitcoin salesmen you hate so much are actually an essential part in the bootstrapping process of the whole Bitcoin network and its surrounding ecosystem. They are a necessary evil to break the entry barriers put up by the dominant structures, and they enable this new thing that has neither a company nor an institution behind it to flourish. Thanks to people who are willing to speculate on its future potential and value. Thanks to the promises of riches by the salesmen.
And this is where the story becomes entirely different from the story of gold: After reaching some critical mass, the network starts gaining most of its value from the fact that it interconnects a somewhat large number of users and therefore enables more and more actual real world use cases. Speculation will still play an important role, but it will slowly become a sideshow while the focus begins shifting over to the utility aspect of the technology. This is something we can see happening right now. And it is something gold doesn't have to offer.
And regarding the whole inflationary vs deflationary currency debate: There is no reason why a currency needs to be inflationary. The whole hording argument is entirely stupid and has been proven wrong time and time again. Again, if you really can't see this, then I again have to question your sincerity here. There are arguments for and against both inflationary as well as deflationary systems. It's not a clear cut case in any way, and dismissing a technology because it will become somewhat deflationary in decades from now is so stupid it hurts.

It's "moving to the right" if a new order gets put in in front of it. Simple as that.

@_date: 2015-06-03 10:49:06
Easy: 
The high USD values in that graph were basically large wallets shifting their holdings back and forth, including to and from exchanges during the bubble and its aftermath. So while it is denominated in USD, it had no real economic relevance. 
Now that the bubble and its hype have deflated, large wallets shifting their holdings around have beomce less, and "real" transactions containing USD equivalent values of everyday value transfers (purchases of goods and services, remittances, ...) have taken their place.
Under that light, your graph in combination with the growth in number of overall transactions is very indicative of a shift to real economic relevance of what's happening on the blockchain, which is the exact opposite of what you're trying to imply.
@_date: 2015-06-30 13:28:11
That's not the standard fee, it's the minimum fee requirement per kilobyte:

No I don't have a link, sorry. But I'm pretty sure that the consensus is that it doesn't add to the decentralization of mining.
I think the core of the argument is that with a lower ASIC-resistance (AR), ASICs will be developed sooner, but they will also be more readily available for a large number of people. While with a higher AR, the development of ASICs will take longer, but that also means that their availability will be more limited due to the higher R&amp;D and production costs, thus actually leading to more centralization.

When was the last time you've used gold as a medium of exchange? It's highly impractical in that regard, that's why all it's used for is putting it in a bank vault and then quickly close the door.

On linux you could use the `nice`command. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:15:13
As I said, the only thing you achieve by using gold to "back" a currency is that you're limiting the supply of that currency. You could just as well forget about the gold and simply agree on a different arbitrary limit for the supply. There is nothing about gold that makes a currency valuable just because it's backed by it. 
So if you think about it like that, you realize that you don't need gold at all. All you need is consensus that the supply of money should be limited. Whether that consensus is that it should be limited by the scarcity of gold or by any other limit doesn't matter. Gold was only the obvious choice for this because it had a limited history of being used as a medium of exchange. But that is not relevant anymore today, which is why gold today is overvalued: It's valuation is an artefact of that history. 
The only usage for gold today is in its industrial application (which puts its valuation far far lower than it is today), and as a "collector's item" that is being treated as a store of value.

Oh, I think I understand what you are saying! 
It's better to move to a new currency instead of using the established one because some people might otherwise profit from the increasing value of the remaining bitcoins when too many get lost. And that's obviously something we don't want, even if the effect is only small. And you tried to demonstrate that by painting a grossly exaggerated picture where somehow 90% of all the money in the world ends up in the hands of a single person. Thank you, that was very helpful! 
I'm glad to know that the world has decided to abandon their currency once too much of it has been lost, even though that fact doesn't have any negative effects on its utility. At least some people don't profit by saving a deflationary currency. That would be bad.

So which one is it now?
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:36:56
I don't think it could, could it? Because the effect of lost coins on the value of the rest of the bitcoins within 10 years is probably very small. And it's even smaller compared to the effect that increased adoption or the increased supply from mining would have on the price. Some would say it's a completely negligible factor in such a timespan. 
So to answer your question: No, not really.
But it's still good to know that in a thousand years or so, mankind has to be prepared to face the enormous wealth of the grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-children of some early adopter liberatians who somehow managed to hold on to their bitcoins over generations. Yup, we better switch to Bitcoin2 by then.

Like I said, the miners who are no longer profitable will stop mining. This will lead to a difficulty adjustment over time, making it profitable again for the remaining miners.
Mining fee is not dependant on block reward, it's only dependant on "network load" (as in too many transactions for them to all be included in a block, therefore some need to be prioritized via fees).

How exactly? Can you give an example of how these colored coins would be more useful (a requirement for having more value) than bitcoin in this case?
In my opinion, this just creates another closed system for no good reason. There are a lot of good reasons to use colored coins, but not for what you described. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 18:16:51
Oh yeah, that is a real problem. These 100 or however many people will naturally hold on to all their bitcoin for generations, in anticipation of all of the rest of the bitcoins getting lost. They will never spend it, they will never sell it, and they will never lose any themselves. They just wait until their bitcoins are worth enough for their descendants to buy the solar system. What an ingenious plan! Such foresight!

I mean sure, it's possible that all those high profile investors didn't recognize a flawed business model. Sure. But how likely is that? Basically if the common user can think of a flaw, it should be safe to assume that 21inc already covered that. I would be very surprised if not.

I hate to correct a Hal Finney quote, but isn't difficulty more a function of bitcoin price and time? Because technical advancements in ASICs will improve the mining efficiency over time, which will lead to an increased difficulty even at stagnant prices. This would make difficulty a somewhat flawed metric to measure the security of the Bitcoin network, as that is not dependant on the difficulty per se, but on the investment that would be necessary to gain a majority of hashing power.

Do you have any actual proof of this? I mean it sounds plausible, but that's about it. Just because something is plausible doesn't mean it's the truth.
The thing is, even without rigging the game, the house always has an edge in these games. So in the long run they're basically printing money. And the most valuable asset they have is their perceived trustworthiness. Jeopardizing this trust by rigging the game would actually be a really really bad business decision, which makes this hard to believe.
But I agree that it's definitely better to be safe than sorry, so always changing the seed can't hurt.

That's a completely different question. But miners have a financial incentive to keep the utility of the network high, because otherwise people stop using it or switch to a fork or a different blockchain, leaving the colluding miners with nothing.
@_date: 2014-12-08 19:06:07

Those are the lottery fees.
@_date: 2015-05-06 18:13:51
Yes it does. But ideally, the fee structure would neither be dictated by arbitrary limits in the protocol nor by technical limitations that can be avoided.
Instead the fee structure should be the result of a free market mechanism where miners compete for the lowest fee transactions they are able to economically process, and users compete for the highest fees they are willing to pay. This market equilibrium will always get unnecessarily skewed by any kind of arbitrary limitations, which hurts the network's efficiency.

But Ripple, well, they are what they sell, and therefore they raise money to make more money with their Ripples.

@_date: 2015-05-05 19:12:27
That problem doesn't go away just because you increase the blocksize: Either **all** transactions get included in **every** new block, or you risk double spending of 0 confirmation transactions, not just 0 fee transactions. Increasing the blocksize just moves the cutoff, but there's always a potential cutoff with any limitation in blocksize. So if that's your argument, then you'd have to remove the blocksize limit completely.

The biggest worry here should be that the live USB has been tampered with, so make sure you download it from a trustworthy source and verify the signatures/hashes.

This tweet does neither admit anything nor does it make it any more likely that they lost bitcoins. He's just saying that the majority of their bitcoins are in cold storage which are safe in either case. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:22:50
Yes, so?
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:07:20
Are you seriously comparing a 14% depreciation of the Euro vs the Dollar to the Bitcoin price development? Like for real realz?

Not funny :(

Top journalism, Btcfeed.


That sounds pretty scary! Care to elaborate how this attack is supposed to work?
@_date: 2015-01-07 14:07:15
I've paid for quite a few goods and services in bitcoin last year. And the opportunities to do so are only becoming more numerous it seems.
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:51:07
Yes, you have been trying really hard to not having to explain yourself. Good job. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:30:15
There was no faux misunderstanding. I still don't understand what you were trying to imply and why you wrote what you wrote. And I guess I never will because all you do is make stupid remarks, attacks and baseless insinuations, and that's it for you.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:18:56
That's kind of a silly thing to do, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-01-06 13:10:26
The only way to be sure is to wrap the blockchain in tinfoil.

Yeah, but the last time Bitcoin was at 260 the protocol wasn't broken yet.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:32:18
Sure, but it wasn't any harder to make a backup of a file back then. Anyway, I was just going for a firstworldproblems comment.

I'm definitely losing buying power with my bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:31:06
You have no way of knowing what the purpose of these transactions is and whether coins changed hands or not.

There was a calculation yesterday in some thread that showed that based on conservative estimates it would take them a bit over a year to make 5 million usd from trading fees. I have no idea how accurate those assumptions were though.

Wow. Just wow.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:35:09
There is not a single shred of evidence that these are "fake" transactions. The article assumes that every "long transaction chain" has to be fake, and gives no explanation why.

Ok, now you took it too far.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:31:11
There is nothing probable about this. It's some system making lots of transactions and we don't know for what purpose.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:24:22
No. But I don't want to destroy my bitcoins :(
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:18:46
Kind of pointless, don't you think? If you want to get rid of some bits, send them to Sarutobi's pot instead:

He censored the only thing he was able to censor here: Himself!
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:12:45
It means exactly what OP said it means: That it changed hands from someone who wanted to sell to someone who wanted to buy.
@_date: 2015-01-05 17:35:10
An alternative explanation for the strangely high fees:
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:41:07
You are the one who is playing a game here!
You know full well how your suggestive remarks will be understood by anyone who reads them, and yet you refuse to explain why you make such an insinuation. Then you top it off with a fear mongering "recoil in horror!". What a bunch of stupid crap!
You also know full well that it's just a weird tweet with an obscure movie reference made at the wrong time, and nothing else. You're just trying to use this to stir up.... whatever it is you're trying to stir up. And if you honestly think that it's more than that, then for the love of god, fucking explain how and why! Or shut the fuck up! Which one will it be?
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:49:19
Sometimes bitcoin requires middlemen and endpoints, sometimes it doesn't. It does however require these less and less.
WU on the other hand always requires middlemen and endpoints, because it IS the middleman and endpoint!
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:39:12
You can also just send unencrypted instead.
@_date: 2015-01-29 20:11:13
Encrypting the seed with a password actually allows for two things:
Restricting access to the content of the file (via another secret) as well as restricting access to the file itself (via non-public storage). Guessing the password alone does nothing, and gaining access to the file alone does nothing. So it's not exactly the same as a seed.
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:26:09
That's true. But there's real trades between real traders too.
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:34:55

This is getting really childish, you realize that, right? 
Here's my last attempt to have an actual conversation:
Why did you make the comments you made when you quoted Barry's tweet, and what were you trying to tell us?
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:25:08
Would you give me $100 this month if it meant you will receive $100 from me for the next 3 months after that?
That's essentially the business decisions big mining farms would have to make in that situation. Of course there will be a game theoretical aspect to it as well because some of them might try to freeload and wait for others to foot the bill until the difficulty adjusts.
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:41:21
Oh, that's nice. We already know the value of regulatory oversight and financial institutions, we just like to find value in new technologies too. Sometimes we even try to interface between the two. We are we. You are you. Hohoho.

It's a side-effect of the transition phase, and it's inevitable.

Yes, it's the fees you owe them for the orders you put in during the no-fee period that didn't get executed.

Stop telling Bitstamp what to do. They almost certainly know more about Bitcoin and security than you do, and they will likely improve their hot wallet security even more after this incident.

@_date: 2015-01-07 15:03:41
Exactly. And they are able to do so with bitcoins more and more often. Which makes it an increasingly attractive alternative to WU.

One of the few good things to come from this crazy bear trend is that the altcoins are getting smashed into the ground even harder. The sooner this crazyness (over 500 altcoins listed on coinmarketcap now.. what?) comes to an end the better for bitcoin.

Yes, I don't understand it! That's what I'm saying all this time, and that's why I would like you to tell my what exactly it is that you were trying to imply. Unfortunately you refuse to do so, and now you're telling me that's because you don't want to "disparage Mr. Shillbert". Are you kidding me?
Here's my conclusion from all of this: You take a tweet that is obviously a bit weird, post it all over the bitcoin subreddits together with some very 	ambiguous comments that seem to imply that Barry is playing out some scam or scheme or whatever here. None of this makes any sense whatsoever and you know that, and that is why you refuse to explain yourself, because your explanation would show how fantastic your stupid implications really were. 
A very strange agenda you seem to have here.

What's the problem? It's entertaining. He's like a parody of the archetypical buttcoiner. 
In this video he also said that he was looking into Bitcoin 4 or 5 years ago, and instantly dismissed it back then. Ouch! The regret must be eating him alive.
And the reason why he is talking about bitcoin so much lately might even be that the price is now lower than it has been for a very long time, and this makes him second-guess himself: He probably fears that he could be wrong after all and miss a second chance to still get in reasonably low, after missing out on being an ultra early adopter 4 years ago.

The main problem with keeping your bitcoins safe is the fact that most people have very unsafe habits when it comes to their PCs: Surfing porn site with an outdated IE, installing whatever and generally not caring about security.
If your system is safe, then so are your bitcoins if you store them locally. But most systems are not safe. 
The easiest way is to put the bitcoins on a wallet on your android phone or iphone, because these have a much better security model by default, and unless you root or jailbreak them, other apps should never have access to your bitcoins. 
For iphone I would suggest Breadwallet, for android there's schildbach wallet (which is more beginner friendly) and mycelium (which has more advanced features) as well as several others.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:49:16

@_date: 2015-05-04 20:12:27
The lack of liquidity seem to stem from the unwillingness of the holders to sell their shares so far. This might be a result of the fact that the current bitcoin market price is most certainly below the break even price for most holders, and even the $350 per 10 shares bid for 50k shares seems to be deemed too low right now.
So what does this indicate? Simply put, everyone holding GBTC shares apparently sees them as undervalued at the currently offered price levels. Or maybe they just haven't gotten around to put them up for sale yet, who knows.
@_date: 2015-01-08 22:25:37
I have defended Bitstamp in various threads on here in the past two days, but I am honestly a bit disappointed to not see a more comprehensive update on their situation by now.
To quote one of the many buttcoiners that have been brigading against Bitstamp today:


@_date: 2015-01-16 20:09:42
@_date: 2015-01-21 17:11:50
Borrow from whom exactly? A very small percentage of bitcoins is available for short selling on exchanges. Not even anything close to half a billion dollars worth lol.
@_date: 2015-05-21 11:42:51
Oh. Yeah that probably wouldn't be such a good idea anyway, because you'd have to trust whoever is hosting it to not alter the receive address.
@_date: 2015-05-04 08:13:59


That's a bit misleading: Everyone holding x amounts of bitcoins would then hold 2x, evenly spread among two networks. So from the perspective of the user, neither their share of the supply nor the sum of their "buying power" has changed. All that has changed is that they now have to keep track of two different kinds of incompatible units. Like having Dollars and Euros instead of just Dollars.
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:58:56

@_date: 2015-01-04 06:49:47
All you said so far is that you think it's weird that Barry would make such a tweet given the circumstances. I totally agree with you on that, it's very weird.
But you have not explained how this lead you to make the strange statement that you would go out on a limb and assume he will be ok, and I'm still none the wiser why you would think that anyone should recoil in horror now. Can you please help me understand this?
@_date: 2015-01-29 10:47:05
Bitcoin's volatility stems from its low liquidity. So what Mr. Buterin is saying is that Bitcoin's liquidity can never increase. Okay.

Mining cost generally follows the price, while the price only approaches the mining cost in a situation where the supply from mining is the driving market force. This might be the case now, but that's really just speculation.
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:25:16
I'm not denying that the usage of HD wallets has an effect on this statistic, but it's not as big as you make it sound, because the graph is measuring addresses that have been active in the last 24 hours!
In your example where someone withdraws BTC to their wallet, they activate one address. It doesn't matter if that address has been used before or if it's a new one, it will show up once in OP's graph regardless.
@_date: 2015-01-06 12:29:41
What are you talking about?
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:27:04
The price might be down because they got compromised (insider selling or selling of stolen bitcoins).

So you keep evading the issue, this time by insulting me. I find it a lot more disingenuous to make baseless insinuations and then refuse to acknowledge them, let alone explain why you made them. But whatever.

No it's not. All you could say is that it's not necessarily a sufficient measure to ensure privacy on its own, which probably nobody would argue against. But it increases privacy in combination with other "best practices" when using Bitcoin, which is what matters.
And it's definitely wrong to say that "attackers always know which is the change address". They can make educated guesses, which might be fairly accurate if the user makes it obvious enough, or completely random if the user cares to make it not so obvious.

No I think the calculation was ignoring operating costs, with the justification that these costs are a) not known and b) Bitstamp probably has capital reserves which are also ignored in the calculation and they might more or less cancel each other out.

Because people see the obvious failure in Bitcoin since its peak over $1000 instead of the less obvious potential in its future, and the media did a good job perpetuating that one-sided view. Funnily enough, the mainstream reporting is slowly shifting from "bitcoin is dead" to "bitcoin technology could be the next big thing". This might simply be coincidence, or it might be more than that.

Like I said, I've paid for surprisingly many goods and services with bitcoin last year. At no point were there any middlemen or pieces of paper involved for me. 
WU is the middleman that can be eliminated by using Bitcoin: Friends or family send me bitcoins from wherever, I spend those bitcoins on goods and services directly. No middlemen. No pieces of paper.
Obviously the opportunities to spend bitcoins directly are not ubiquitous enough yet to make this a 100% alternative the WU, but it has become a whole lot more viable in the past year, and the trend seems to be pretty clear.

Definitely not gentlemen. But it would be a lot more worrisome if there was a good reason for the price to keep going down.

1. You can also use a salt with SHA256 the same way. This is not a reason to use one or the other.
2. Saying scrypt is more time intensive to brute force is a bad argument: That means you are patching up insufficient entropy in your passphrase with a computationally expensive algorithm. But thanks to Moore's Law, that is really only a temporary solution. The right approach is to make sure that your passphrase has enough entropy to begin with, because then it doesn't matter what hashing algorithm you use.

That's true for the proposed hard fork for increasing the block size limit, but it's not true in a general sense for any hard fork (and this thread is about hard forks in general I thought). And in that case, the argument that a 50/50 split would be equal to 100% inflation becomes moot anyway.

Funny thing is that the mitigation methods are in fact pretty simple to implement. I still doubt that has been done however.
Anyway, I don't deny that accepting zero-conf transactions always comes with a certain risk, but calling it pretty simple to do a double spend here and steal the ATM's money is just extremely misleading.

More likely you will drain the fiat in the machine before getting a single successful double-spend in, making the owner of the machine a happy camper because you just paid a ton of markup fees to him.
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:37:18


Such as?
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:11:59
While this might be a possible scenario, the chances of it happening are slim: Even if there was such a lucky streak from xt miners to trigger the consensus rule, it's a lot more likely that the momentum gained by the xt side up to that point would cause the rest of the network to follow suit. After all, nobody has an interest in stubbornly causing a split when it becomes clear that the consensus rules will be triggered sooner or later, except for a few fanatics maybe.
So while I agree with you that a non-contentious hardfork would be a lot more ideal, the scare scenario you're trying to paint in your comment is probably the least likely outcome here. Still, avoiding even the slim chances of such an outcome would obviously be preferable.

@_date: 2015-08-04 14:33:34


That's a fair point, but..
a) you can't do any number of double spend attempts against the ATM because its fiat reserves will run out, and
b) you are paying a markup fee to the owner of the ATM with every failed double-spend attempt, which is generally somewhere between 3% and 10% for ATMs like that. So if your success rate for double-spending is too low, you still lose money.

Spam to increase blocks, push bigger blocks to force high latency miners to SPV mine or have their blocks orphaned, mine invalid blocks to force the SPV miners on an invalid chain, publish all the valid blocks afterwards to reap all the mining rewards.

Sadly that's exactly what I'm seeing too.
@_date: 2015-08-20 16:05:21
First of all, I understand the concerns and perceived risks of increasing the block size, but I do not in any way understand how anyone could see this as Bitcoin becoming "just another Paypal" or anything similarily drastic. Threatening to leave the project over a blocksize increase is, in my opinion, akin to a child throwing a tantrum just because mom has washed his or her favourite teddybear. 
And I don't know much about Mike Hearn's background, and quite frankly, I don't care either. It shouldn't even matter. The code is there to see for everyone, and if you don't like something about it, you are free to point that out and not use it. And so is everyone else. There are no "trojan horses" or "backdoors" here. These terms are only getting thrown around in an attempt to create FUD, and it's disgusting!
Oh, and trying to label Mike Hearn or any of the other devs as a "benevolent dictator" pretty much makes me want to put you on ignore.

@_date: 2015-08-23 14:18:54
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:33:06
As I said, this isn't just a question of luck or rolling the dice, it's a question of incentives for anyone who is being affected by a potential fork: As soon as the possibility of xt reaching the 75% threshold becomes real, almost everyone on the network will have an incentive to join the xt fork to avoid this often described contentious split, purely out of self-interest. The scenario of there being a "standoff to the death" makes not much sense, but it's a good scare argument.
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:02:26
RBF is implemented by a few miners in a First-Seen-Safe version (despite Peter Todd's activism to force the unsafe version), which only allows "double spending" with the same outputs. Which isn't really double-spending in the sense we're talking about here.

Are you out of your vulcan mind? 
@_date: 2015-08-05 11:39:21
There isn't a single entity "giving out bitcoins" to the miners. Instead the Bitcoin network as a whole agrees that a miner has proven that he has done the work that is required to earn the block reward, which essentially lets the miner give 25 bitcoins to himself.

All he's saying is that a few large mining pools should not necessarily be able to veto an otherwise majority decision.

Why? If xt becomes the main chain, anyone can fork the codebase again, and any changes that are not forking the network can easily be adopted by anyone who agrees with them. Mike and Gavin would only have control over one tree in the codebase. Another scare tactic that is ignoring the truth.


Nobody wants to see this happen. But threatening to leave the project if they don't get their way is extremely childish and not very constructive to the discussion or to finding a compromise.

A blockchain is still very much mutable, it just takes a whole fucking lot of hashing power to do so, while everyone else is working against you. How a centralized permissioned blockchain protects itself from being altered against the better knowledge of the users (or clients in this case) is the question here.

It just means that in these industries, prices behave highly inelastic to either demand or supply, and highly elastic to the other, or as the article states it:






This is not an "exception" or violation of the law of supply and demand, it just means that these industries have very unique supply and demand curves. Even the article acknowledges that:

Not exactly. I am questioning how reasonable it is to make a statement such as the one you quoted from Peter Todd above. Again, in my opinion, this is a gross overreaction. But of course Peter Todd can do whatever Peter Todd wants to do, and if that means threatening everyone with his permanent absence in case of a block size increase, then so be it.


That's okay. I prefer to not just believe anything I read from Peter Todd.

Sure it would be possible and it has been proposed several times. The problem is finding an algorithm that works well and that can't be gamed or abused by any parties in any way. A dynamic adjustment rule adds complexity to the system and makes it less predictable. A fixed limit increase is completely predictable and transparant to anyone, which is why it's probably the preferred solution.

Yeah but the real scary part is how its meaning is being repurposed as "someone who opposes the status quo", whereas during the political inception of the term terrorist it was used in an almost entirely xenophobic context, mainly directed against muslims from the far east. Now it's slowly becoming more and more normal to label anyone who doesn't agree with the government a terrorist.
I'm not even saying that this is what's being done in this article. But somehow that sentence didn't feel right to me, and it wasn't the first time I had that feeling when reading or hearing about "terrorsts" in the recent media.

Tl;dr: Study showed a correlation between the search term 'Bitcoin' and related "criminal activity" search terms such as 'Silk Road' based on Google Trends. The article argues that this study is badly flawed because Google is showing these criminal activity search terms in the auto-complete bar to anyone searching for Bitcoin related topics. Also it is criticizing the study's assumption that just because someone is googling for something related to "criminal activity" they must be a criminal.

The centralization argument is one of the perceived risks I mentioned. The problem here is equating this risk to something you called "becoming just another Paypal".

I don't think low volume is something that generally increases volatility, if anything it should be reducing volatility all things equal. What matters is the liquidity in relation to the trading volume. And while the visible liquidity in the GBTC order book might also seems kind of low, I'm pretty sure the "hidden" liquidity of people holding shares to sell at higher prices and people holding fiat to buy at lower prices is quite high, and the order books would quickly fill up and adjust prices back to "normal" levels if volume increases.

I don't disagree with you entirely, but Bitcoin's raison d'être was never to fix the inadequacies of the existing payment systems. It was however specifically designed to fix the inadequacies of centralized trust-based and censorship-prone ways of storing and transferring money. It just so happens to also make a pretty good payment system, because the current payment systems also suffer from the mentioned shortcomings of centralized systems.
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:10:09
No, it's not a solution, and it's not supposed to be a solution. The discussion here is whether it's "pretty simple" to double spend against the ATM in the video, which it is not, and even attempting to do so will have very little net gain for the effort. In the worst case the owner of the ATM will just shut it down, thus you lose your ability to cash out at that location. 
And if you're not using the ATM anyway, then the fees vs low success rate of double spending will make it unattractive for you to begin with.

Nobody says that 0 conf transactions are "secure". That's the whole point of having confirmations. If 0 conf transactions were secure, we wouldn't need a blockchain.

Payment channel solutions are the most efficient way to deal with transactions that have a reduced requirement for trustlessness and/or security. Forcing every coffee purchase on the blockchain is inefficient and wasteful. This is true regardless of the the block size.
I'm pretty sure that in a few years, most casual transactions will take place over some kind of payment channel, be that the lightning network, a sidechain approach or something else. All these issues we're facing today are the result of the immaturity of the Bitcoin ecosystem, which after all is still in its infancy. 
@_date: 2015-07-02 17:15:05
It doesn't matter whether those blocks are emtpy or contain thousands of transactions, the effect of securing the blockchain is the same. Transactions and fees are not needed for this as along as there is a block reward.

Of course it's the same coin, I'm not destroying one and producing a new one. Every output is the same coin as a previous output, unless you're a miner. The question here is not whether it's the same coin, but whether it's the same owner. And after making a chain of transaction long enough, any assumption of ownership becomes tantamount with assuming that everyone using bitcoin is a doublespending thief, which makes this kind of analysis worthless as a risk mitigation tool.

"I like to have choices" is not an explanation for why you like to have choices. It's called circular reasoning.

I didn't check your math, but I agree with you that spam attacks demonstrate that demand can be artificially increased enough to inconvenience users, and that the cost of doing so is too low. And this is definitely a good argument for increasing the block size sooner rather than later. But it should not play much of a role when talking about the extent of the increase, nor should it be an argument for a centrally planned fee structure, as these two aspect should be the result of potential technical capacity and usage of that capacity.
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:23:13
That's not even what closure means in this context. And every transaction is part of a chain transaction, so according to your logic every bitcoin is close to its coinbase inception and therefore still belongs to the miner.

Sorry, but that is an unbelievably simplistic view to have. Payment channels and sidechains offer clear advantages, regardless of whether Bitcoin will scale on it's own in time or not. The two (or three) are in no way mutually exclusive! Sidechains also open up new possibilities beyond the scaling issue, and payment channels also are one of the most promising approaches when it comes to dealing with the zero-conf problem in the future.
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:09:48
Yes, I agree with you on that. And payment channel solutions would also be part of this free market, and people should be just as free to use them if they offer advantages over transacting directly on the blockchain.

It entirely depends on the fee level that the backlog is supposed to occupy: If the backlog is only zero fee or very low fee transactions, it will be relatively cheap, but it will also have almost no impact on the "usability" of Bitcoin. If the goal is to raise the necessary fees to get included into the next block in a significant way during a 6 months period, then it will also incur a very significant cost on the spammers.

That only works if your first transaction propagates through the network slower than the second transaction that you send after the first one. And it also assumes that the ATM does not check for conflicting transactions, as it would also quite instantly receive (but discard) the second transaction you sent, basically getting informed of your intention to attempt a double-spend.
Double-spending is not as "simple" as most people make it out to be. In fact, most people could never successfully do it.

It's nice to see some reasonable comments from you once in a while that are not clouded by your irrational hate of everything that is bitcoin for its inability to solve the problem of human greed.
I however don't agree with your final paragraph: We already have a minimum fee, and it is charged based on the space a transaction takes up on the blockchain, which makes a lot more sense than an arbitrary minimum fee per transaction. And if there is more demand than there is available block space, then fees will have to increase based on supply-and-demand market mechanism.
@_date: 2015-07-17 18:16:33
If I understand this correctly, CPFP means the receiver of the transaction can spend the unconfirmed incoming transaction with a higher fee to one of their own addresses in order to motivate miners to give the original transaction a higher priority. So in this case, only the receiver can indirectly boost the transaction fee of a transaction, but not the sender. Therefore there isn't much overlap with FSS-RBF where the sender can increase the transaction fee, right?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:17:26
Why would this be concerning? Bitcoin currently is mainly an investment to most people, and that's just fine! The motivation to hold bitcoins will only slowly shift from the investment aspect to other things as the ecosystem matures and Bitcoin's utility increases. Right now, the utility is just not there for most people. But this is not unlikely to change drastically in the future, which is why bitcoin is such a promising investement right now in the first place.

The universe wants one money and one language. Network effects are hard to ignore, and doing so comes with a cost.
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:45:58


The miners are part of the network. And in the end, they are the part of the network that represents the supply side for block space. The miners don't set the price, they supply block space, and they sell it to the highest bidders. Which is basically how supply and demand works.


And they don't have to know. All they need to know is that fees can depend on network load, and their wallets should handle this for them as conveniently as possible.


This is not a problem of minimum fees or no minimum fees, but a problem of the limited available block size. This is inherent to how Bitcoin works at the core, and any solutions to remove this completely will most likely go against a decentralized free-market approach. Again, Bitcoin is not and should not be a centrally planned economy. But there is nothing that says that there can't be services that handle this "load balancing with fees" for the user if there's demand for such a service. Wallets can even implement something like that with child-pays-for-parent and replace-by-fee mechanisms.


Yes, this would be a possible scenario in the case where demand constanly exceeds supply. In such a case, Bitcoin has to either scale further to accomodate the increased demand (even larger blocks, invertible bloom filters, etc), or part of the demand has to be taken off-chain or to side-chains or to payment channels such as the Lightning network.
In the meantime, the fee market is acting as a buffer to allow the Bitcoin network to still function within "acceptable" paramaters even during periods of high load (as the recent "stress tests" have demonstrated beautifully).

Or maybe I'm too cheap for even that and I'll just do a bunch of chain-transactions with my doublespent outputs before attempting another double-spend.

I just want to second what said: Wait it out for now. Once the transaction confirms, your bitcoin client will see the funds when it syncs up. And if it won't confirm you might want to contact the website that sent it to find a solution.

That makes no sense. Payment channels like the lightning network simply add another layer on top of Bitcoin. They don't change "what it means to use bitcoin".

The inflationary cost is the same whether I only hold bitcoins and never send a single transaction, or whether I send thousands of transactions.

It amazes me that an intelligent person like yourself, who obviously spends a great amount of time educating himself about Bitcoin, still does not understand that the "cost of running the network" is not a cost of running the network at all, but 1) the intended mechanism used to distribute the 21 million bitcoins in a transparent and fair way (as in everyone can participate in mining), and 2) the intended mechanism used to guarantee the security and the integrity of the network via PoW.
Calling this *excessive cost of the network* or anything like that shows either a complete lack of understanding or a deliberate misrepresntation of what it is. Sorry, but this completely diminishes all your other arguments in my eyes, which are often quite valid, and makes you look like a shill or troll. Too bad really.


Again a completely disingenuous misrepresentation of reality. Or were bitcoiners forced to stop using Bitcoin during the stress tests? No they weren't, the fee market mechanism worked as intended.

@_date: 2015-07-12 13:09:20
Not necesseraly. You can look at it like this:
For every dollar the bitcoin market cap increases, one dollar of wealth somewhere else has to be lost (this is a bit overly simplified but probably close enough).
Now the thing is that Bitcoin is still really fukcing tiny compared to everything else. So if the Bitcoin market cap grows by one billion dollars, that's still barely noticeable anywhere else, because that loss of an equivalent of one billion dollars is spread out over trillions and trillions of fiat and other assets.
So if your bitcoins value increases by 100% at this point, everyone else's fiat kind of loses let's say 0.00001% of its value, which is not noticeable to anyone. But once the 0.01% start transfering their wealth into bitcoin, then the dimension would be very different, and fiat money would be losing value rapidly. So better make sure you buy bitcoins before the 0.01% do :)

As I explained in my other comments, I disagree with this premise, and I also explained why.


Yes, this is in order to allow for a transparent distribution of the supply over time. This has nothing to do with a fee market at all: The supply of 21 million bitcoins was chosen completely randomly (maybe not completely randomly but for the sake of this argument) and the number doesn't even matter, the only thing that matters is that everyone knows in advance how it is being distributed over time.
The fees however are an essential aspect of every transaction and arbitrarily changing the fee requirements changes the quality of Bitcoin as a whole. Thus the fees need to result from supply and demand and not from a central planning act, which will never be able to account for all eventualities, and just lead to market inefficiencies and other unexpected results.
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:31:17

@_date: 2015-07-15 14:22:49
Miners want the bitcoins they mine to be worth as much money as possible. Bitcoins are only valuable if they are useful and have the expectation of still being useful in the future. By artificially raising the transaction fees, miners would make bitcoins less useful and therefore less valuable. And because fees make up only a small portion of the miner's rewards for now, this strategy would be completely counterproductive for the miner.
Also, miners are competing against each other.
@_date: 2015-07-09 23:05:58

The problem is that increasing the minimum fee per transaction by an arbitrary amount to prevent spamming is a bit like putting the cart before the horse: Increased fees should be the result of increased demand, and not a means to pre-emptively regulate demand. We all know what happens with centrally planned economies :P
In an ideal world, we would never need a block size limit, and therefore there would never be a backlog. So I agree with you on that. But spam attacks make it necessary to impose an upper limit for the damage that can be done. So any decision to increase the blocksize should - in my opinion - always assume the worst case of these blocks being constantly full. If the network can't handle this worst case scenario, then the block size increase is not viable.
So in conclusion: If the block size gets increased, then spammers are free to fill every block if they're so inclined, as long as they pay the necessary fees to compete with other demand for the available space.
Quick edit: Or in other words, neither the block size nor the fees should be defined by the spammers, but solely by the network's capacity and its usage.

Hunting for that 2x2 pixel sized close button on the overlay without accidentally clicking on the ad is more than just a small annoyance. Popups, popunders, sound blasting flash ads etc are more than just a small annoyance. And on top of that, hijacked ads are one of the most common ways of distributing malware.
If ads were an acceptable part of most websites, then there would be no need for adblockers and specifically no need for an "allow acceptable ads" option.

@_date: 2015-04-08 08:07:11
Tl;dr: Bitcoin is not about the price.
That's nice and all, but fact is that the Bitcoin ecosystem needs price appreciation as a means of continuously bootstrapping both the network and the economy. If the price stays where it is now, Bitcoin is doomed to remain insignificant. I don't think any of us would be "perfectly happy" with this outcome.

Why is it so important to you what some dictionary definition of the word says? What's important here is that almost everyone holding bitcoins has lost money and it's not a good feeling. The word bagholders describes that pretty accurately.
@_date: 2015-04-28 17:57:17
My basic argument is that adoption is a function of price (and more precisely the expectation of an increasing price), because the only tangible value proposition for the "mainstream" right now is price speculation and investing. This is because the Bitcoin ecosystem has failed to generate enough added utility over its prevalent alternatives to attract enough interest in the past 18 months. And in the same 18 months, which represent the longest stretch of a declining price in the history of this experiment, Bitcoin has lost almost all of its appeal as an investment. And that's why adoption is very visibly stalling, and stalling hard.
This problem is exaggerated by the fact that, unlike with previous bubble busts, the Bitcoin ecosystem is at a critical stage now. And the failure to generate enough adoption could lead to a vicious cycle or negative feedback loop or domino effect or whatever you want to call it, with VC startups failing to find a viable business model, development projects focusing their ressources elsewhere, big capital losing the little interest they might still have, etc. 
I could go on about this but I'm tired of repeating myself.

Sure. But a private key is nothing else but a random 256 bit number converted to base58. And you have to securely store them somewhere to keep them private. So this is essentially the same thing as using randomly created passwords with a password manager, only difference is if a random password leaks, you don't automatically also risk losing your bitcoins.

Why? What's the advantage of using "a new blockchain" in such a collaborative environment? Why not just use a conventional database, which is a lot more efficient and flexible?

@_date: 2015-04-15 13:53:04
What I'm trying to say is that Bitcoin will not become useful for most people without it first going through a continued period of price driven adoption. A few VC funded startups and some fringe use cases is not going to be enough to convince people that they need bitcoin. The only thing that can convince people at this stage is the prospect of making money thanks to a rising value. Everything else will hopefully come afterwards, but it will not come without that. And as things are now, even that value proposition is gone.

@_date: 2015-04-02 14:56:19
You left out one very important detail: How is that new system actually addressing the Byzantine fault tolerance problem? 
In Bitcoin, it's done by PoW and decentralized storage and verification, all done inside the Bitcoin network. Your system doesn't have PoW, but instead only a signing mechanism. So in order to achieve consensus (aka a majority of signers signing), they have to reach some form of consensus outside of the system first (how is the decision to sign or not sign made?). 
You see, it's not as easy as "take blockchain and remove everything that makes it work, then profit!".
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:57:15
Maybe everyone has a slightly different definition of what constitutes a scam. In my opinion, the ethereum sale was pretty much a scam because it focused purely on selling promises to gullible people and raising false expectations for "investors" by implicitly making it look like an investment even though it was actually a lot more like a crowdfunding wanting donations.
@_date: 2015-04-07 09:08:39

Ok, so you are familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons, but you don't understand it. Let me condescendingly explain to you what I mean:
The tragedy in the tragedy of the commons is that even if every single person realizes the problem, they can not individually solve it. The only way to solve it is to introduce an element that binds everyone to a sustainable behaviour (regulations and rules).
So you see, me not blocking ads and purposefully inconveniencing myself doesn't solve anything. All it would do is make my own internet browsing a lot worse.

@_date: 2015-04-02 12:19:44
Yes, thank you for bringing that up.
The bootstrapping of the network and its surrounding ecosystem is probably the part that is the hardest to reproduce. Banks would have to invest quite a lot in order to get their blockchain to where Bitcoin is today. And as I said above, the end result only makes sense if they forgo any control over it, so there's no incentive for banks to go this route, just to make a copy of what is already there.
@_date: 2015-04-02 11:37:44


I honestly don't understand what you're trying to say here, sorry.
Anyway, a blockchain is not some magical thing that overcomes borders and makes trust obsolete just because it's a blockchain. All of that is the result of the underlying network, which is based on decentralized control, decentralized mining and and open protocol. And that's not something a bank or a group of banks can reproduce, unless they are willing to completely forgo any kind of control, in which case the result would be the same as Bitcoin, which we already have.

You already got the bitcoins from all the people who got blinded by your flashy website, your buzzword videos and your artificially created urgency to buy before thinking thanks to your countdown timer. No pressure to deliver anything now, and you're basically free to do whatever you feel like with the "non-investor" money, as it legally wasn't an investment even though everyone who bought your ethers treated it as one. Very well executed scam, no doubt about that.
@_date: 2015-04-15 13:36:16


The incentive for most people to invest in Bitcoin is the expectation of a rising price. This is the reality. The price is both the most visible and most tangible property of Bitcoin for 99.9% of people out there. And Bitcoin utterly and completely failed to deliver on that front. It not just failed by not appreciating in value, but failed by actually losing 80% of its value over one and a half year!.

Most people don't litter because they have been taught not to. Those who haven't had the luxury of such an upbringing probably don't do it beause of the social stigma associated with it.

I don't see why any of the above wouldn't be possible to achieve without a blockchain. Of course, if you make those the defining criteria of what constitutes a blockchain in the first place, then everything that provides those criteria will obviously fit the definition of a blockchain. It's a rather pointless argument.

"The Slaying of the Bearwhale" could have been a nice storyline for a turnaround of the market trend and spark some new public interest in Bitcoin, because we all know how much everyone loves a cute little story.
Unfortunately there was no turnaround, so all that meme achieved was putting even more mainstream attention on the fact that Bitcoin completely failed to deliver on any of its promises during the past 18 months, and that it's probably best to stay far away from it for anyone who values their money.

Yes, you can substitute the consensus function if you like (even though PoW is the only one proven to actually work.. no pun intended).
That doesn't change the fact that a centralized "blockchain" offers no advantages over conventional database solutions, it just adds unnecessary limitations. And just because you take some properties found in the Bitcoin blockchain and add it to a centralized or decentralized-within-restricted-boundaries system, doesn't make it a blockchain. That's just a misuse of the term blockchain and adds nothing of value other than being able to say "Look at us, we are doing blockchain now!".

All I can say is that my neteller account got blocked several times for normal use, but it didn't get blocked when someone withdrew all my money to different sites I've never used before. And it wasn't a trivial amount of money at all.

If the market does not react to news regarding the "fundamentals" of the underlying asset, then that pretty much means that there is a disconnect between real world events and real world utility and the market. How is this supposed to be the case? If anything, it's a sign that something is inherently wrong with either the asset or the market.
Ever wondered why there's usually relevant news displayed on market watch sites? That's not because the charts are too boring, it's because those two things are supposed to be correlated.

Tracking via IP or browser fingerprinting is a problem inherent to all our online activity, Changetip is in no way a special case. Facebook tracks everything you do online via their like buttons. So does Twitter, Google, and a dozen other companies.
If you want to avoid this, you have to use a VPN and disable all the technologies used for fingerprinting in your browser, which essentially breaks half of the internet for you. Just because this is the reality we live in doesn't mean it's suddenly Changetip's fault, nor should it take anything away from the service they provide.

In b4 dashcoin, xmr, shadowcash and all the others spamming this thread. 
Here's the news: None of these will ever catch on. Simply because they fill a niche that Bitcoin covers well enough, and they offer no utility beyond that. Pretty much noone needs perfect anonymity. What people want is privacy and anonymity options that are good enough. And that's exactly where Bitcoin is heading: Different levels of privacy and anonymity as an option for different use cases. And those options are getting better and easier to use (and that's not even including the potential of sidechains). Privacy focused altcoins are interesting from an academical standpoint, but they are an economical dead-end.

If you're paying with Bitcoin and don't supply any other identifiable information to the VPN provider, then they don't know "you", all they know is your IP.

The value of one unit is irrelevant. 1 Bitcoin bit is about equal to 1 Dogecoin. It doesn't fucking matter. Bullshit argument.


If that's really the case, which is highly subjective, then just denominate in bits. Bullshit argument.


If you undertstood how confirmations work, you'd know that they're an indication of (statistical) confidence. Quicker confirmations just means less confidence per confirmation, especially if they are based on a network with a way lower hashrate, and are therefore nothing but snakeoil. Bullshit argument.

While you for some reason minimize the systemic aspect of the problem and put all the blame on Changetip, which makes no goddamn fucking sense!
And at the same time you also fail to acknowledge the fact that the user has all the options to opt out of any of this by 1. not linking their account together and 2. using VPN, TOR and similar services if they're paranoid about Changetip profiling them based on IP or browser.

When using a VPN, they don't, and the VPN provider only knows what someone with a certain IP is doing, but they don't have the identiy behind that IP. That's the important difference here, the disconnect between IP and identity. That's what I was saying in my other comment anyway.

Doesn't pretty much every bittorrent client allow for prioritizing files within a torrent? And sequential downloading of a file in order to get a quicker preview is actually really bad in cases where there's only a few seeders.
Anyway, I get it, there's some tiny things that utorrent does differently that seem to be hugely important to some people. Sorry for starting this discussion :)

You could create a locktime transaction that is set to be only valid at some point in the future, sign it, and make it available to your children. That transaction would send your bitcoins to an address your children have access to, but only after the locktime has passed. You could set the locktime to one year for example, and then update it every year. Should you pass away, your children can then broadcast the signed transaction once the locktime has passed, which would send the bitcoins to the shared address.
Coinb.in has a somewhat easy to use interface to create these kinds of transactions:

It's also not "not anonymous", whoever told you that was wrong.
Bitcoin is in fact perfectly retaining the level of anonymity you start out with when making a transaction, from pretty much completely anonymous to not anonymous at all.

There is no need to "pay attention" to not link anything together. It's as simple as not acitvely linking stuff together. It doesn't happen by accident. That bullshit buttcoin rhetoric is so fucking annoying it makes me want to put you on ignore.
And ChangeTip is not a special case. Anyone who uses Gmail will have ALL THEIR IDENTITIES, be it online or offline, linked together the moment a single mail references it (confirmation mails for signups, password recovery, newsletter, emails from your workplace or lawyer or whatever). It's part of being online, and it takes a fuckton of effort to avoid it. ChangeTip is neither to blame for this nor is it in any way a special case.

I'm not sure I understand how it's tied to a Google ID?
But you're probably right that to be perfectly anonymous without revealing any information at all, a solution similar to Bitmessage would be preferable. Then again, very few people would need that level of anonymity, while in most cases the relative anonymity and the privacy provided by Chatsecure and other OTR messengers is perfectly fine, especially in combination with TOR. It sure as hell beats Whatsapp and Hangouts etc :)

Maybe, but in my opinion the percentage of people who had heard of Bitcoin prior to 2013 is really really tiny. It didn't really come into the focus of the mainstream until after April 2013.
Today a relatively large percentage of people have at least heard of Bitcoin or read about it, but most of them still only have a very superficial idea of what it really is. But the fact that it's still here and people and the media are still talking about it is what's slowly changing their perception from 'fringe technology and crime' to 'established technology with a potential future'. It's a slow but very important process.

People who own a lot of bitcoins do so because they bought or mined them at a time when nobody else was interested in them. And people who buy bitcoins for under $250 today can only buy them at that price because most people are still not interested in them! Do you see where this is going?
Without people like Roger Ver, bitcoin wouldn't even be worth $250 today. So just keep waiting until everyone wants their piece of it, and keep complaining about how some people own so many.

The dollar bill's use case if to be easily taken from a tree. Bitcoin's use case is to be easily accessible for anyone from anywhere. That's why people can pitch in for the bitcoins, but not for the dollar. Poor dollar, forever alone.

@_date: 2015-03-01 12:55:11
The number of confirmations is irrelevant. What matters is the cost to double spend a transaction after x confirmations.
The Bitcoin network has so much more mining capital behind it that 1 confirmation on the Bitcoin network probably equals 10000 dogecoin confirmations in terms of cost of performing a double spend. It might even turn out that the cost of doublespending a 1 confirmation dogecoin transaction is not significantly more expensive than doublespending a 0 conf bitcoin transaction. It's snakeoil and a bullshit comparison. But that's what dogecoiners are all about.
Oh and that doesn't even take orphaned blocks into account. 1 dogecoin confirmation is essentially worthless.
Edit to your edit: No, it's a trade-off. And 10 minutes blocks have proven to be a really good trade-off so far.

That would mean reusing the same address, which is bad practice for a whole bunch of reasons. Instead he could just use a spending wallet and a saving wallet and use a locktime transcation on his saving wallet.

As I explained above, after each transaction, the chance that they are following the right coins gets cut in half (or even more if there are more than 2 outputs). After 10 transactions that's already less than 0.1%.

Good point. And of course people keep hearing and reading about Bitcoin, and even if they never look into it any further, this constant exposure also does its part in shifting the public's perception of Bitcoin from 'fad used by druggies and criminals' to 'might be the money of the future after all'. I think we're already seeing this effect in the way the media is reporting on Bitcoin related topics today compared to over a year ago.

Did you not read my Gmail example, or are you purposefully being daft? Both Gmail and Changetip provide a service. Both Gmail and Changetip might be able to create a profile about you from the information you provide by using their services. The difference is that Gmail knows pretty much everything about their users, while Changetip might be able to make some guesses about different user accounts on different social media sites. And the user even has the option to avoid this (use VPN or TOR and different browser profiles for the paranoid).
Again, this is the online world we live in. Changetip provides a service within these boundaries, nothing more and nothing less.
And it also appears that you don't understand the nature of the pseudonymous blockchain and what is possible to track and what is not. Once I send my Changetip withdrawal to a new address, they can only guess whether these are still mine or not. And that's not even mixing.

T+L = 20 + 12 = 32 = F

2008 wasn't pretty. The fallout of the current cycle could make 2008 look like a walk in the park. The funny thing is that everyone seems to be seeing the writing on the walls, but nobody knows how to avert what's coming.

If McDonalds doesn't announce that they accept bitcoin during the superbowl, everyone is disappointed.

You are making too many assumptions and are not taking all the relevant factors into account, which is why your conclusion is wrong!
Right now I have the choice between using my everyday fiat currency which just so happens to be inflationary, or using bitcoins.
Now bitcoin at this point is a comparatively bad currency: Its acceptance is low, aquiring it is cumbersome for most, and the value fluctuations are unpredictable on most days. That is why for most people holding bitcoins (me included) it is first and foremost an investment. An investment that has the advantage that it can also be used as a secure, private and easily transferable currency.
So given that choice, I naturally prefer to spend my inflationary currency over my bitcoins when I feel that my bitcoins are currently undervalued as an investment. If I didn't have that choice, and our economy was based solely on deflationary currencies, I would spend my bitcoins instead. Because at the end of the day I still need to eat, I still need gas for my car and I still want to enjoy the wonders of modern technologies in my home etc.

Your browser might not have access to the directory where your wallet.dat lies (you're probably on a Mac?). 
You could try copying the wallet.dat file to your download directory first, then drag and drop it from there.

Google knows everything I look for on the internet, which sites I visit, knows the content of all my emails, sees all my calendar entries, has access to all my photos and a lot of other documents, knows who I'm friends with and can read all of our communication, they can track my location etc etc. And now they also want to know what I do with my money. Sure, why not.

I think Bitcoin is a pretty cool guy. Eh kills banksters and doesn't afraid of anything!
@_date: 2015-02-23 12:58:44
The fee might have gotten bigger because you've been sending the same bitcoins around several times in short succession, as the "age" of an output is a factor in determining the priority of a transaction. This is an anti-spam measure of the network.
I'm not exactly sure whether there are any clients that take this into account when calculating the fee though.

Wow, that is kind of crazy. This guy is the personification of a banker. Him publicly putting bitcoin on a similar level with gold is probably the biggest endorsement of Bitcoin I've ever seen.

Bitcoins are like pizzas: Everybody loves them, and you can cut them in as many pieces as you like. The cats are like the miners, the guardians of the pizza: They keep track of who owns which slice of pizza, and if you try to eat one that doesn't belong to you, they will claw your eyes out!
@_date: 2015-02-23 10:14:19
All I can say is that I have spent significantly less bitcoins since the price went into the 200. I can't imagine that I'm the only one being more reluctant to spend something that I perceive as being undervalued.
@_date: 2015-02-10 11:24:52
If we're talking about offsetting inflation, that would translate to a 10% growth rate per year. Can you imagine the headlines if Bitcoin only achieved 10% growth in a year? They would have to invent a new word because dead wouldn't even begin to describe it!
But yeah, Bitcoin is probably easy to implement on a technical level. But these are large companies or companies that have to be compliant with regulations in dozens of countries and jurisdictions. Implementing the technical aspect is probably their least concern.

Of course. But an essential part of money is trust. And when the people at the key positions of our financial system don't have trust in it, then you know something is wrong.
Metcalfe was just talking about technological issues which got solved, big deal. Whether the fundamental issues of debt based money can be solved as well remains to be seen.

They totally don't have an agenda, they're just spending 8 hours every day hunting down every bitcoin thread on reddit and constantly spreading their FUD because they have a different opinion! I hope we will see a lot more of them here in the future so we can have a totally healthy discussion about Bitcoin with them!
@_date: 2015-02-03 01:02:20
Haha yeah, and they only very recently introduced 2FA. Like a few weeks ago. It's absolutely crazy how long it took them to get such a basic security feature. And that's for a web wallet where people keep thousands of dollars. How they're not out of business yet is beyond me. I think the only reason is that they became extremely popular with poker players very early into the whole online poker boom and have profited from this position ever since. A perfect example of "good enough" and network effects.

Not just that, but these guys had very unique insights into the inner workings of the current financial system. They know exactly how much of a house of cards they helped build, and how fragile the whole thing is in reality. Them seeking shelter in gold and other alternatives is very revealing.

I think this graph only shows addresses that have unspent outputs. That means "the lifespan" of the addresses really doesn't matter, because once the outputs are spent, the addresses won't show up in that graph anymore. So yeah, saying it means nothing is a bit dismissive, don't you think?

Which means he would have to create a new paper wallet every time. 
Anyway, locktime transaction are an option and OP should know about it so he can decide what fits his use case best.
