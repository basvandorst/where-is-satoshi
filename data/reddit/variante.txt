Hungary experienced the most serious hyperinflation ever recorded in 1945-46. Worse than Zimbabwe.

Great news for Brazillians, who suffered a period of severe hiperinflation and continue to do so, in a lesser yet evil degree:
*[cross-post from - translated]*
[Accumulated inflation in Brazil in the 20th century was over 1 quintillion percent \(or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000%\)](
Brazilian inflation cut three zeros from the currency every time the minimum wage came close to 1 million "monies of the time" (except where the thing messed up in early 1993).
Who earned the minimum wage in 92-93 was a millionaire, and since 1943 until 2013, there were **5 cuts** of **three zeros** on our currency:
1943 (Cr$ 300,00) to 1966 (Cr$ 84.000,00) - Period of 23 years;  
1967 (NCr$ 105,00) to 1985 (Cr$ 600.000,00) - Period of 18 years  
1986 (Cz$ 804,00) to 1988 (Cz$ 40.425,00) - Period of 2 years  
1989 (NCz$ 63,90) until 1993 (Cr$ 4.639.800,00) - Period of 4 years  
1993 (CR$ 5.534,00) to 1994 (CR$ 42.829,00) - Period of 1 year  
1994 (R$ 64,79) to 2013 (R$ 678,00) - Period of 19 years  
Each time that happened, the purchasing power of our currency was 1.000 times smaller. Ie, the financial elite printed 1.000 times more money than the initial total circulating currency of each cycle.
Many show the calculation of the depreciation of the dollar since the Fed was created in 1913: U$ 100,00 turns into U$ 0,30 in 100 years.
Now let's do the calculation for Brazil: How much 1943's Cr$ 100,00 would worth today?
**1st Cut:** 100,00 / 1000 = 0,10  
**2nd Cut:** 100,00 / 1000 / 1000 = 0,0001  
**3rd Cut:** 100,00 / 1000 / 1000 / 1000 = 0,0000001  
**4th Cut**: 100,00 / 1000 / 1000 / 1000 / 1000 = 0,0000000001  
**5th Cut:** 100,00 / 1000 / 1000 / 1000 / 1000 / 1000 = 0,0000000000001  
Since we use money issued by the CB, **Cr$ 100,00** in 1943 turns into **R$ 0,0000000000001.** That is **1 cent divided by 10 Billions.** Devaluing our money **100 trillion** times in **60 years.**
The Brazilian currency hasn't turned into the Zimbabwe dollar because it was changing its name and cutting zeros. 
[Average inflation was 45.2% per year in the 20th century. \(Terra\)](


If many think that the weak dollar is indecent and even call it slavery, what about the situation in Brazil?
Edit 1: Even with the supposed stability of the Real Plan, if we continue with the same pace of "slower" inflation these last 20 years (1000% = 10x) for over 100 years, the calculation of **inflation** will be **10 million per cent** (every twenty years everything increases 10x). Funny that this number seems small comparing to 1 quintillion per cent in the last century, and some even defend this absurdity: 10 million percent inflation projected for the next century in Brazil! 100 Reais of today will be worth only R$ 0,001 (one-tenth of 1 cent) in 2100. And if continues as is. Remember: it can get worse.
Edit 2: This situation isn't a privilege of Brazil, a lot of countries suffered some period of hiperinflation. It's systematic:

Out of curiosity: Have you lived through it or you just heard of?
I vividly remember seeing my dad doing desperate accounting over the kitchen table until late at night. Buying the whole month of groceries right after his salary, etc...
I am not giving a second chance to my government administrate the currency. What they did was unforgivable and I can't take it back.
That kind of pillage happened all over the world in some instances.  It drastically widen the gap between the riches and the poor, and the effects last for generations.

Mining equipment is expensive because of the import taxes. Few mainstream news covered it. We have the World Cup (and Olympics) to talk about.
I'm not gonna lie, we need more traction. Not surprising Argentina is ahead of us. They have 73 places that accept bitcoins, Brazil has 22.

Manaus is the reference of Free Economic Zone or Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Brazil:

Super Interessante is one of my favorite magazines since I was a kid. Lot of scientific articles and good math puzzles.
I just bought two articles for ~U$0.50 each. I just want to tell you guys that the process was quick and flawlessly.
The payment is through mercadobitcoin, a brazilian exchange. This is the first screen (notice the name of **Abril Comunicações S.A.** - one of the **largest brazilian media conglomerate** - in the invoice):
The confirmation was **instant** after the payment in bitcoin. That's the second screen:
They are top notch and always a good reading, even if lately they are a little on the fence, for my current taste, about a lot of controversial and juicy subjects.
That article about Bitcoin is very informative and accurate, they even remembered brazilian inflation times at 80-90's. 
Way to go, Super Interessante !!
Edit: And they make astonishing infographics as well:

The NY correspondent, Guga Chacras, showed a deep understanding of Bitcoin and all the last stories. 
He mentioned that he didn’t invest, but has friends that made a lot of money.
He also mentioned that Bitcoin’s designers really didn’t want Central Banks or Governments messing with currency. (He mentioned the Fed but all Central Banks are the same)
Fair and positive. Although nobody in the panel would invest in bitcoins.
