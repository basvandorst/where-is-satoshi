Bitstamp has been great. It definitely takes them a while to get to you but they are getting better. And they take care of their own. They also have some of the lowest cost options for moving money into the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:17:55
You are right. Those can be evaluated out though as you can see the amount of movement in the Address. This is also one my assumption I talk through. Good points though.

Cold Storage is life bro. Check out Ledger Nano S. That thing is solid.

I see what you are saying. I responded to a similar post above. The large address show the action in those addresses so you can easily determine which ones are being used for exchanges. I didn't add this into the calculation because they just arent that many. The power trendline equation I used roughly accounts for this. However, keep in mind, I set the trendline to stop at 1 BTC, without any sub-BTC addresses. This means that the number is probably much less than the ~811k I have estimated here. The best estimate would probably come from looking at the people vs btc on coinbase and a few other major exchanges.

That's awesome. Yeah, it has gotten to a point that you have to be upper class, or super risky middle class $$$, to buy a full BTC. A 2016 survey of Americans with savings showed that only 14% of Americans had savings greater than $10,000. That should put it in perspective. The majority of people just don't have the money, and the majority of those that do would wipe out their savings buying just 1 BTC. You have to have serious money now, or you have to be ok with the risk of loss.

I wonder what the actual club number is though? For instance, we know that 4 million bitcoins are gone forever (according to a recent report). We also know that there are some people that own A LOT. I estimated the Winklevoss twins own roughly 77,000 bitcoins. I think the number is probably much lower around 15 million or less people with at least 1 BTC. Don't forget that there are 14 million millionaires in the world and they will be taking their cut soon if they aren't already.

You are right. Only affects final assumptions and not the number provided. Will update. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:43:58
You ask too much my son.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:50:07
The assumption is that BTC will continue to be lost in the future but at a much lower rate. But it’s anyone’s guess really.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:28:42
Slick dude!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:28:35
Yes! This analysis was the most generous I could provide. It is likely that the concentration of BTC is much greater and it will continue to expand as such via a log function into the future.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:22:51
I don't know. But I can hope.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:55:52
Good job bro. You are wiser than most.

The hard limit of 21 million will never change, but you are right, BTC will continue to be lost in the future. The loss will be at a much lower rate. Plus as companies get better and better and storing and securing BTC, we will see less and less of an impact. We have come a long way since 2009.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:00:33
I agree. I don’t think Bitcoin is going to be a good payment option for small items in the future. Maybe big purchases. But it will be a digital safe with digital gold. No one drops a bar of gold on the counter to buy a stick of gum.

Make sure to post a picture.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:33:45
Yup. This exchange is great.

I've heard it as both "hold" as well as "hold on for dear life". Stuff like this evolves in a culture. What it was is not necessarily what it is. Happy to be evolving with this community. :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:46:51
I’ve actually thought about this too as a way of speaking about it in more digestible terms. Eventually we’ll have to.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:04:03
Don’t forget Wikipedia! They are the worlds source of modern knowledge for many.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:45:46
Probably much less and it will continue to shrink, especially over the next few years.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:02:12
Omg this is so accurate.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:53:26
Haha unfortunate that’s just wealth distribution.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:52:34
Damn dude! Good for you!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:21:33
Dude that sucks so much.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:51:59
This is a rough calculation. That being said it is assuming no fractional ownership. That means this is ~811,000 is very generous. Probably lower.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:04:03
Yes yes and yes. Too many people believe they cannot invest with the current price.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:20:59
Perhaps a post for a different day. :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:24:18
No body owns that much. I think he is saying he owns 0.1 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:48:48
I think it is tax free if you find a real estate BUYER who is willing to take the $1,000,000 worth of BTC as the payment for the property. That was you never sell for dollars but only ‘trade’ your BTC for a $1,000,000 house.  Tax free. But check with an accountant.

Bought in at $1900 and have continued to invest a lot over the year. Last investment was at $8200. The swings now are serious money for me. It used to be 50-100 swings but now it is 500-1000 swings. Hard to look away. I may need Xanax.
