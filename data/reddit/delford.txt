Forum software that doesn't include a voting feature and a reply-to feature (eg, at bitcointalk.org) is worthless. 
One of the best examples of forum software is reddit itself - and it's open-source.
Theymos must not be very intelligent if he's wasting a million dollars re-inventing the wheel. 
In the future, we shouldn't donate money to guys like him, with no strings attached. 
Everything needs to be voted - discussions on forums, decisions about how to spend money. A single person alone can't be our "king". The whole point of bitcoin is to be decentralized.
We could establish a thread here right now asking for suggestions on how to spend that money - and the top-voted comments could "win" - and be implemented.
But instead, we're stuck with King Theymos and his despotic rantings.
Live and learn.

I hear what you're saying. It's a fractal, random walk, Brownian motion, martingales, Monte Carlo method, whatever. I did try to read through some financial mathematics books (although I'm not too fond of stochastic differential equations) - but even as a layperson, we all can understand that a market will move unprectibably based on many, mostly unknowable factors.
And I agree this movement is healthy - because, as you said, if the price simply moved steadily "up up up" then it would suddenly be *predictable* - and everyone would pile in. So it can't go up (or down) in the same direction forever - it has to be unpredictable and random.
Now, let's make a slight refinement: Let's postulate that the price did not go up *steadily* from 100 USD to 300 USD over the past year (ie, this would be a world where no November-December 2013 12x spike had occurred).
Let's say that it went from 100 to 300 USD over the past year - *but taking a random walk above and below that trend-line*.
This would be quite unremarkable market behavior. It wouldn't be "predicable" because there could still be peaks and valleys above and below an average trend-line from 100 to 300 USD.
Basically the Willy Bot theory can be useful in response to people asking "Why didn't the price go up after Microsoft and Time?" 
According to the Willy Bot theory, **the price from Nov/Dec 2013 to now might have been a random walk above and below a trend-line moving from 100 to 300 USD.** And when you add in the effect of an alleged Willy Bot pumping the market with USD 112 million in fake fiat in Nov/Dec to cause a very brief spike to 1200 USD - well then there of course will be massive pressure to "correct" that spike back to whatever the "real" trend-line would have been.
So it can be important for people wondering about the "falling" price of 2014 to know that *certain people* (I have no idea who) have theorized that the 12x price spike of Nov/Dec 2013 was faked.
There is no evidence that that price spike was real or fake, is there? All we know is that the exchange where it apparently started:
(a) Couldn't pay out fiat for many months in late 2013;
(b) Went bankrupt in 2014;
(c) Provided conflicting stories about what was going on;
(d) Never accounted for the missing fiat or bitcoins
So given the shakiness of that exchange, it might be reasonable to take the "1200 USD" figure with a major heaping of salt. This is just something which has been occurring to me over the past few months. Yes I know there is selling pressure of 3600 bitcoins being mined every day. But there could also be "correction pressure" due to an ATH of USD 1200 which was based on non-existent USD 112 million.
Does anyone know where the data dump (on which the Willy Bot was based) came from?
Essentially, I'm coming from the aspect of Plato's shadows in the cave. I just don't know what to believe for the price anymore - when the leading price indicator (Mt Gox) proved to be so hackable and eventually went bankrupt.
I hope that eventually there will be some more decentralized means of buying and selling bitcoins (eg, the feature on Mycelium which lets people find local buyers/sellers). 
So I think it is healthy to be skeptical of numbers that came, essentially, from Mt Gox. Not a good "single source" of truth by any means.

Here's another link, this time from ZeroHedge, with some excellent details documenting gold price suppression, via the London Fixes.
It includes several charts (intraday, and average intraday), as well as a PDF of a class action lawsuit filed against the London gold fix member banks: Bank of Nova Scotia, Barclays, Deutsche, HSBC and SocGen.
Well, we already know they manipulate LIBOR and Forex - to the tune of trillions of dollars. Many people probably think "How can they manipulate the price of precious metals?" The secret is: issuing phony "paper" (ETFs) representing non-existent precious metals.
This is why I am *very* concerned that something similar could be attempted with certain upcoming Bitcoin ETFs. 
But now with Bitcoin, for the first time in history, we have the power to avoid this - by  *demanding* cryptographic proof of reserves - in other words: "Show me the money."

Hi - Sorry I realize I *do* tend to write a lot. (I still write on a laptop - can't deal with smartphone keyboards). So I can tend to get verbose. Just faster to leave it all up there, rather than edit it all down.
I guess I'm proposing a kind of "post-modern" relativistic interpretation of bitcoin price. 
A 12x spike in one month on a market that couldn't pay fiat and several months later went bankrupt does *not* seem like a good source to be basing any of our assumptions on.
I didn't hear about the gold market glitch but I will look that up.
One of the main things we proclaim about bitcoin is "it can't be counterfeited", "it can't be manipulated". 
But what if we've been basing this whole "2014 bitcoin price crash" narrative on a 1200 USD all-time-high at Mt Gox that was due to Willy Bot?
One of the most important aspects of bitcoin is the price. (I know there are many who have said "the price doesn't matter" - but it *does*.) 
Bitcoin is supposed to be *different* than the usual shenanigans of the legacy financial system - rigging trillions of dollars' worth of FX, LIBOR and precious metals markets.
The pristine, isolated pure part of Bitcoin - the network itself - *is*, as far as we've seen, transparent and honest and stable.
But Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum. In order to be of any use, it has to be exchangeable for fiat and for goods and services - at a "fair" market price.
The interfaces between bitcoin and fiat - in particular, the exchanges, most of which are shady - many of which have disappeared - this is a big murky area which can be damaging to Bitcoin in several ways:
- It keeps people away from Bitcoin, due to fear. 
- It makes it easy to manipulate the price.
Bitstamp could implode overnight. BTC-e is in Russia and nobody knows who runs it. One of the majore Chinese exchanges (I can't remember which - Huobi or OKCoin) apparently has no fees - thus allowing the possibility of faked trades to increase volume (ie, "self-trades"). Mt Gox is gone. And many other exchanges have also disappeared.
Many parts of the ecosystem cropping up around Bitcoin are a festering cesspool of corruption, fraud and incompetence.
And yet - we are basing our entire 2014 bitcoin price narrative on these shady actors.
I don't think the spectre of Mt Gox is gone yet. As long as we keep believing "The price dropped from 1200 USD to 300 USD", then the rot of Mt Gox is still with us.
And you can bet that MasterCard and JPMorgan and all of our other fiat slaveholders are quite happy with the festering cesspool of shady operators and unreliable numbers growing up around Bitcoin.
We know they have the motivation - and the means - to destroy Bitcoin.
If I were JPMorgan or MasterCard (or some govt that hated Bitcoin) - I wouldn't try to ban it. That would be too obvious.
I'd just set up yet another PHP-MySQL based exchange in some remote godforsaken jurisdiction -and let the trading begin! 
I'd flood the market with fake fiat (heck, I could flood the market with fake btc too - after all, it's only PHP and MySQL while it's on my exchange ha-ha-ha), I'd create volatility, rollercoasters, panics, fraud, corruption, black swans, naked short selling, pain, agony and tears - and rinse and repeat for the next ten years until every Bitcoiner is thoroughly traumatized and gives up on this majestic dream.
Do we have any *proof* the powers-that-be aren't doing that?
"Nah, they'd never do that." (And yet - we see the CIA sending fake rappers to Cuba to try to take to down their govt. We see that the Feds tried to do to Tor recently. We saw the Snowden revelations - only 1% of which have been published yet.)
Lawsky's not our enemy. Our enemy is probably hiding behind the mask of some PHP-MySQL based exchange causing havoc in the markets.

As others have mentioned in this thread, the gold market is rigged.
**Why is this being done?** Because rising gold prices expose the fact that USD, EUR, GBP, JPY etc. are in danger of becoming worthless due to quantitative easing.
**How is this being done?** It's easy, because many people who "buy" gold actually only buy *a piece of paper representing* some gold. 
This is what ETFs (exchange traded funds) such as GLD give you: a piece of paper. 
And if you read the fine print in the contract, it says that they're not even obligated to deliver you the gold you supposedly "bought". 
If you request delivery, they reserve the right to give you paper currency instead of real gold. And this is precisely what *would* happen if everyone demanded physical delivery at the same time. 
According to estimates, there is anywhere from 10x to 100x more of this phony "paper" gold in existence (worthless pieces of paper issued by ETFs such as GLD) than *actual* gold.
So, to artificially suppress the gold price, certain banks (mainly JPMorgan I believe, but there is probably a wider network of "old boys" involved) are officially in charge of preventing the USD from collapsing - by flooding the markets with fake paper "gold" at strategic moments.
The whistleblower on this was Andre Maguire, you can google him.
Here are some intraday gold charts showing the afternoon London "dump" (which is probably done using phony "paper" gold, not physical).
I suspect that certain bad actors may eventually attempt to use Bitcoin ETFs to manipulate (suppress) bitcoin prices in the same way. However, it should be possible to counter act this: by demanding "proof of reserves" (demanding that ETFs prove that they have the BTC which they say they have - by showing their Bitcoin address(es) using cryptographically signed messages).

I appreciate your skepticism. It's one of the best things about reddit - everyone here is so skeptical. 
This is much healthier than what you see among many consumers of more "mainstream" media - who tend to swallow everything hook, line and sinker.
The question is: what do we want to be skeptical about here?
(1) a crazy unsubstantiated blog post from an unconfirmed hacker-obtained data dump that mysteriously surfaced in May 2014:
(2) a crazy unsubstantiated Nov/Dec 2103 price ticker API from a unsecure hacker-operated exchange named Mt Gox that mysteriously disappeared in March 2014?
Pick your poison/skepticism. Originally my knee-jerk reaction, like most good sheep, was to believe (2) - the official API.
It's just that lately it occurred to me that we could just as easily have opted to believe (1) - the underground whistleblower accusation.
As far as I know, *both* are completely unsubstantiated and unproven. 
So we can be skeptical about one or the other. 
*"The truth is out there. (I want to believe.)"*
(Of course, a holder of btc will have psychological reasons for preferring to believe that the price really *did* spike to 1200 USD in Nov/Dec 2013. But that's another matter altogether.)

Thanks for that link. I would agree that they are worried that another crisis is on the way, and they are quietly battening down the hatches.
Actually the crisis that became evident in late 2008 never actually *went* away - even after they threw tens of trillions of dollars at it.
Therefore, when the crisis again rears its ugly head, they will have much fewer options to deal with it *this* time around - as they've already shot their wad with the tens of trillions of dollars they created from thin air in QE1, QE2 and QE3.
Regarding the timing, I have a hunch: I bet the shit is going to hit the fan in late 2016. This is because the world reserve currency is the (petro-)dollar, and most US presidents tend to serve the maximum of 2 terms - and they tend to sweep all the financial hanky-panky under the rug for those 8 years - and then it all comes roaring back again at us us once their 8-year reign is over. (Kinda like the well-known "Friday night [bad] news dump" which is practiced in DC - only this is the "end-of-the-8-year-administration [bad] news dump".
Bush served from 2000 to 2008 - and the shit hit the fan in October 2008.
So I have a hunch the current simmering worldwide financial crisis will again become visible around Sept-Nov 2016, when Obama is about to leave office - and leave the next person to clean up the mess.
Also let's remember to factor in that Bitcoin is due for a block reward "halving" around August 2016. So between the outgoing administration of the global hegemon, and the halving of the new global currency, late 2016 could be very interesting. 
(My uninformed guess is that the price of bitcoin could skyrocket in late 2016 precisely for these two reasons - but I'm not an economist, and in particular I don't know how this sort of crisis might play out, so anything could happen. But if it *does* skyrocket at that time and for those reasons, then it will be a different sort of bubble than the one allegedly caused by the Willy-Bot on Gox injecting "unlimited" [virtual ie PHP/MySQL-backed?] fiat in Nov-Dec 2011 into that now-defunct exchange - in other words, it could be a bubble that would pop very little - unlike the long slow decline from 1100-1200 USD to 300-400 USD we saw in 2014.)

1 BTC = 1 million XBT
Eventually people might invent a word that the abbreviation XBT represents.
Many people have already proposed "bits" - ie 1 bitcoin = 1 million bits. But a lot of people are against using "bits" because it already has so many other meanings in computer science.
Other possibilities might be:
1 bitcoin = 1 million "xbits"
1 bitcoin = 1 million "bixels"
People already created the word "pixel" (which means "picture element"). So maybe we could create a word like "bixel" to mean "bitcoin element".
Then we would have:
1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 bixels = 1 megabixel
Finally, it's good to quote the price in terms of 1 dollar = ....
People will start buying a lot if they see something like:
1 USD = 3000 XBT
intead of 
1 BTC = 333.33 USD
This way, people can spend a dollar and get "a few thousand" of something (which is fun) - rather than "a few thousandths" of something (which is kinda depressing and makes them feel like they "missed out").
And as time goes by, 1 USD will buy fewer and fewer XBT ... so people will want to buy earlier to get more XBT / avoid getting fewer XBTs.

Hi Theymos -
You sound like a nice guy and all and I appreciate you trying to be transparent here.
On the other hand, I hear you're kinda young, so you probably have a bit too little "perspective" or managerial skills - and bit too much ego ("Hey, the world needs my new bulletin board software!").
When a mature, experienced manager has a budget of 1 million dollars to spend on various projects, he'll look at all the options and try to get the most bang for the buck.
And the last thing the world needs these days is some shiny new bulletin board software. You know full well that if you were reporting to some manager at a company that needed some bulletin board software, they'd NEVER let you go out and write one from scratch - that's just insanity and a total waste of money, reinventing the wheel.
Everyone knows there are dozens of full-featured, open-source bulletin board software projects available to choose from - including reddit itself, which is open-source, and which includes lots of cool features like voting, karma, private-messaging, etc.
I realize you have a tendency to shoot back at everyone "you gave the money to me, I can spend it the way I see fit." Fine, if you want to keep saying that - so be it. 
But you also have a big opportunity now to do which would be good for you, good for the rest of us, good for democracy and good for Bitcoin's future success.
You could open an AMA thread here right now specifically devoted to a discussion on (a) how the donations should be spent and (b) what type of bulletin board software should be used for bitcointalk.org - and you could promise to use that AMA as a basis for decision-making going forward.
Reddit (with its voting mechanism) already provides us with a pretty good toolkit to support a democratic decision-making process. You should use it. 
Bitcoin is still fragile in many ways - its success is not guaranteed. The image and acceptance of Bitcoin has already been hurt a lot by Karpelès and any number of other unethical scammers. A lot of people I know are staying away from Bitcoin because of these scandals and scams.
The spirit of Bitcoin is supposed to be about decentralization and trustlessness. You have the tools right now to allow the community to decide how this money should be spent - without the decision-making process being centralized around everyone having to just trust you.
The choice is yours. You can either look like yet another bitcoin scammer (which apparently is the image many people have of you now), or you can look like an enlightened supporter of democracy and decentralization.
If you were to do an AMA asking (a) what to spend the money on and (b) specifically what kind of bulletin board software to use, I would vote for:
(a) let's use the money to fund bitcoin scholarships and developer salaries (eg via Lighthouse)
(b) let's use existing world-class bulletin board software - ie Reddit software itself - for bitcointalk.org

I don't know if what this guy is saying is true or not, but I just want to point out a few general things that we *do* know for a fact:
(1) For the first time in history, with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, "cryptographic proof of reserves" is now possible. 
This means that a holder of bitcoins (eg a large exchange) can agree to publicly sign a message with their private key to show that they do indeed hold a certain amount of bitcoins associated with a certain public address (eg the cold storage containing the coins which are being traded on their exchange).
(2) Volatility can *good* for a trader - especially if the trader themself can manipulate the price. 
For example, if you were a scammy large holder of bitcoins who happened to control a large online exchange which *doesn't* use proof-of-reserve, then you could profit by doing the following:
(a) "pumping" the price up to 1,200 USD (using faked trades on your site) ... while also selling a portion of your bitcoins into the faked rally ... 
(b) then "dumping" the price down to 400 USD ... while buying back all the bitcoins you sold at a cheaper price
(c) the fiat left over from the "pump" price you sold at minus the "dump" price you buy at is pure profit.
Lather, rinse, repeat.
Wouldn't it be great if you could have had the foresight to know what we all know now: that the price was gonna skyrocket to 1,200 USD last December and then plunge to 300 USD last week. I bet a lot of you are now wishing you had sold at the peak and bought at the trough. Being able to perfectly time your exit and entry points would allow you to set up a major money-making machine. 
Unfortunately, for us suckers who aren't running a faked exchange, we can never "call the top" or "call the bottom" as events are actually in the process of unfolding. We can only see this *after* the fact, with 20/20 hindsight. 
But just imagine the incredible power you'd have if you could massively fake trades on an exchange in a market still this tiny and immature. 
(3) I haven't looked into the specific exchanges mentioned in the OP, but as far as I know, they do *not* use "proof-of-reserve". Plus, I have heard that they don't have *trading fees*. So a lot of people already regard the *trading volume* of these exchanges as being possibly faked. 
Logically we should also regard their *reserves* (cold storage or whatever) of these exchanges as possibly being faked.
So, while some people ITT are shouting "proof or it didn't happen", we're really shouting that at the wrong person. The people we should be shouting that at is the *owners of these exchanges* - not at OP.
C'mon everybody, we're dealing with *money* here, folks - in a world where everyone is desperate to get some. Until proven otherwise (via some simple crypto-auditing mechanism such as "proof-of-reserves") we should always assume that an online exchange does *not* have any of the coins it claims to have - until they prove otherwise.
So, the burden of proof here (and the "means and motivation") is on the exchange owners - not on OP. Until they "show us the [crypto]-money", we are fools to believe they even have any.
A large chunk of the community has already been burned by the antics of the crappy PHP programmer Karpelès and his goxcoins (plus maybe also by some "willy"-bot that many say was released on that exchange to fake volume - either programmed by him or by someone else with access to the servers implementing the trades). 
The only thing we can and should trust is the blockchain itself - and the powerful verification possibilities is provides, such as providing cryptographic proof that you indeed do own the coins you say you own (by using your private key to cryptographically sign a message regarding your public bitcoin address).
For the first time in history, you can literally "put your money where your mouth is" - using Bitcoin.
(4) We've all lamented the tragedy of the spooks trashing our internet with their spying. 
But then again, we've had the tools all along to use math to outrun them - for emails (or any kind of upload actually), you can simply run PGP *on your machine* before sending your data out onto the net - and then it your data is pretty much 100% safe from prying eyes. 
And for web site design, there are now fully encrypted web servers such as Mylar (built on top of the very nice real-time web app framework MeteorJS, which in turn is built on top of NodeJS and MongoDB).
So the cryptographic software is out there lying around ready for anyone to use. We don't need political protests to stop big government and big business (and hackers) from spying on us - *we can use math to sidestep the issue and avoid this risk altogether.*
Similarly, with the possibility of proof-of-reserve offered by Bitcoin, we don't need auditors and regulation to make sure big exchanges don't rip us off - *we can use math to sidestep the issue and avoid this risk altogether.*
(5) There are many indications that big ETFs such as GLD and SLV do *not* hold the precious-metal reserves they claim they do. And many of us are starting to realize how bankers use "fractional reserves" to try to legitimize this practice of handing out more phoney paper IOUs representing 10x or 100x of the actual "assets" they're supposedly "safeguarding" for you in their "vaults". 
"Naked short selling" (as JPMorgan is suspected of doing in order to suppress the price of silver and prop up the USDollar) and the (somehow venerated and "legitimate") practice known as "fractional reserve banking" are by now simply ingrained parts of human nature.
If people trust you to hold their "real, hard" assets and accept in return the paper IOUs you print up, then it's only natural for you to be tempted to print up and hand out *extra* IOUs backed by *nothing*.
Until proven otherwise, it would be logical to assume that some crypto exchanges have been engaging in this same sort of shady and all-too-common practice.
**TL;DR:** Sex and money make the world go around. It is human nature to spy (invading other people's "private" lives) and to steal (invading other people's "private" wallets). Crypto actually allows us to pretty-much totally sidestep these dangers - eg by using PGP to keep our data private while we're communicating on the web, and by using proof-of-reserves to keep our wallet private while we're trading on an exchange. But there are other aspects of human nature that we also need to overcome: our own laziness and gullibility.
We'd be naïve to believe that there isn't *some* programmer of a large exchange out there who *isn't* pumping-and-dumping the market for their own nefarious purposes right now. 
Remember, during the time while your coins are being held by an exchange (that doesn't practice proof-of-reserve) they're not actual bitcoins secured by the blockchain - they're merely "wannabe-coins" secured by (unaudited) PHP and MySQL, and chewing gum and paper clips, and hopes and prayers and wishes and dreams and possibly smoke and mirrors and lord-knows-what-else.
So *stop* telling the OP "proof or it didn't happen" and *start* telling this to the owners of the exchanges.

I know nothing about the source or veracity of the evidence presented here:
It's a story that went around back around that time.
But people who might be coming to Bitcoin in 2014 should be probably at least be made aware that that theory was proposed.
Where did they get the data for that report? I remember hearing it was due to some hack of Mt Gox - some kind of data dump?
We *do* know that people couldn't get fiat out of Mt Gox for many many months around late 2013 and early 2014. That would certainly corroborate with the data in the blog post above.
I agree that it's important to base our perceptions and decisions on "proof" or "reality".
The thing is, pretty much everyone has been basing their perceptions and decisions on a figure of "1200 USD per Bitcoin" - based on numbers stored in an unsecure PHP/MySQL database at an exchange run by known incompetent and/or fraudulent operators - and that exchange soon went POOF! How much proof or reality should we accord to numbers coming from an exchange like that.
So the question is: Where is the proof that Bitcoin ever really was being sold, in large quantities (ie, in accordance with the volume indicated from the publicly available API), on Mt Gox in Nov-Dec 2013 for 1200 USD?
I bet some lucky, clever traders *did* manage to sell BTC for 1200 USD during that rally - ie, there were real people paying real money for BTC at that time (ie, they weren't the "Willy Bot"), and some up of them paid up to 1200 USD.
But a lot of people also got *nothing* for selling their BTC. I think there was proof of that - from various sources.
And now we have that blog post cited above, which has been drifting around in the blogosphere for the past year. Many people are aware of it. Many are not.
I think it's important for people to be aware that that blog post exists - with its allegations / theories about the Willy Bot spending 112 million USD in fake fiat, in spurts of 2,500,000 each. 
Was there ever any more investigation of the theories in that blog post? I never really followed it up at the time - not being in a position, personally, to verify or debunk it.
I am curious if anyone has any more info on the status of that blog post. Is it totally made up? Is it based on an actual data dump? Was the data dump ever confirmed?
These seem to be important questions. As I say, they make all the difference between the following two scenarios for Bitcoin Price 2014:
- crashing from 1200 USD to 300 USD
- rising from 100 USD to 300 USD
Does anyone have any proof about what happened at Mt Gox?
If we don't, should we continue to let the rally of Nov-Dec 2013 affect our perceptions of bitcoin prices?

You do realize that you sound ridiculous asking for "burden of proof" regarding something that's common knowledge - eg, "the sun rises in the East" or "QE benefits the rich".
Pretty much anyone who's been following economics since the onset of the crisis in autumn 2008 knows that QE has mostly benefited the rich.
You can also try typing "QE benefits..." into Google and see what the little dropdown menu tells you:
