Anyone know what coins they will have listed?  Not sure if they've announced or anything.

Stop looking at BTC/KRW.

I imagine it was deleted because there's 600000 subscribers here and 599999 of them have an open ticket with Coinbase.   And they just saw a guy get his problem solved by making a thread and posting it on this sub.  So now the sub will be filled with 'please upvote for visibility' posts and becomes @_date: 2014-02-25 10:23:44
Most likely scenario: Satoshi Nakamoto comes out of hiding and saves the day.

That's an empty wallet.

Well. I don't want to say 'that's good' cause it's not but I am happy that I'm not alone.  I guess misery loves company?

That's an empty wallet. Stop posting stuff you don't understand.

Because he bought them to purchase things.   You know... like the entire intention of bitcoin.   Bitcoin was never meant to be a long term investment.   It actually hurts bitcoin if more and more people buy them to just 'hodl' because no business is going to spend money on a payment option that no one ever uses because no one ever spends them.

Bitcoin is also a gamble.

You bought $80,000 worth of bitcoin a few hours ago?
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:02:52
Saving for later.   Thanks.

Terrible idea.  You don't know the price of bitcoin tomorrow.  He needs to cash out completely.   He needs actual cash on hand.   He may be able to afford a house today, but tomorrow he might not be able to buy a pack of gum.   Never buy something on the hope that your investment continues to rise.

Unless you bought for $230 yesterday your buying power is now $150

Not so fast there buddy.

If you can't see the difference then there is no point in continuing this conversation.

Some drug dealers hold real jobs and have real life customers.     It would be fairly easy to hoard all your bitcoins and just resupply that way.

Well they got mine at $225.  I'll buy them back cheaper tomorrow.
