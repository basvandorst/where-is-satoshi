There was a reference to Bitcoin in Aaron Sorkin's show Newsroom. I think it was the second episode of the third season.
A young rich sibling mentioned the idea of investing his fortune in Bitcoin. I think it was meant to make him look foolish.
Considering this aired in November of 2014, it was actually great advice.

It's all true.

I'd been waiting for a way to get my investments away from our inflationary currency while still allowing it to grow. I like how Bitcoin fits the bill perfectly. I am also looking forward to the time it becomes easier to transact and fulfills its destiny as a currency.

You can buy a Ledger Nano S from Coinfort with bitcoin.

Now that your account has been set up, has there been any issues using the Wells Fargo account with the exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:17:05
Glad you decided not to do it. 
It would be a major voliation of the trust of your employer.

Maybe available cash is jumping in before the Monday transactions hit?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:50:28
I remember something similar happening when I split my coins using Electron Cash. Turns out the wallet was pointed to the wrong chain. I changed the chain, and the coins appeared.
Maybe this is what's going on:

Why does going up in value make a currency ustable?
I understand that it is bad in an economy based on debt, but I think an economy based on debt is crazy.
I am going to reread this and see if it makes sense to look at Bitcoin's deflationary nature an asset rather than a liability:
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:51:47
Have you checked out the How It Works section of their website?
Why isn't it possible?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:39:28
They are listed on Ledger's site.
Scroll down to the second group under United States.

It seems to me that investments would just have to get better in order to compete, and that the profits that successful businesses do make would have more buying power as they would also be paid with the deflationary currency.
People will continue to buy what they need, and may wait to buy what they want, or even decide to do without it if it's simply not worth it to them. 
It might limit frivilous spending and investment, but not necessary spending and quality investment.
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:37:28
Do they already have a Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:23:35
You won't have two wallets. You will have two copies of the same wallet.
Just like two televisions set to the same channel.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:51:02
Yes, in the sense of them not closing accounts for transfers to exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:54:50
Not a drunken tweet, but this:

This is Jedi

There's no way to know for sure, but study about Bitcoin, what it is and what it can do, and decide for yourself if it is worthwhile.
If Bitcoin is truly going to attain mass adoption, these are still early days.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:52:55
Have you had any issues with a Wells Fargo and the exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:31:53
This is what attracted me to Bitcoin. A decentralized store of value, but also a deflationary store of value.
My confidence in Bitcoin is also tied to my lack of confidence in fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:28:50
I am interested as well.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:03:03
Buy, you fools!
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:31:41
Did they give a reason for the two week hold?
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:17:40
I think that part of the appeal of using a ledger is that the wallet keys never leave the ledger and are never entered on a phone or computer.
Using the Copay wallet on the ledger sounds like it kind of defeats the purpose.
If it were me, I would create a new wallet on the ledger even though transferring would cost a fee (try and set your own fee,) and stop using Copay.
It depends on whether you value the security or the fee.
Yes, you can send coins to other people with only the ledger.
I'd also look into using GDAX because transferring from Cionbase to GDAX is free, and from GDAX to your wallet is free. You only pay the miner's fee.

Have you looked into OpenBazaar? I don't know a lot about it, but it seems to be serving this purpose. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:07:59
Isn't this something people do on Bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:22:24
Have you tried listing yourself as self-employed?
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:27:00
I guess they should only invest in investments that they think will return more than the rate of deflation. 
Otherwise, the deflationary currency is a better investment. How is that bad?
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:20:22
I don't think it is possible for a contract with them to beat buying the cryptocurrency outright and holding.
A little research will show this.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:21:43
Sounds like "mark of the beast" level stuff, right there.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:36:22
Thanks! I just ordered one from Coinfort from the Ledger site's retailer list.

What if you are transferring pre-forked coins from one wallet where you control the keys, to another wallet where you control the keys.
Would this risk losing one side of the forked coin? Only lose both forks amount of transfer fees?
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:01:32
Is this because he used LocalBitcoins with this amount?
If he would have used and exchange to sell them, would he still have been arrested?
@_date: 2017-10-31 04:34:22
Me too.
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:46:53
It won't show up automatically. As far as I know, Ledger will have to write it into their software/create a wallet for it, and they said they don't feel it's safe to do that until replay protection is in place.
I believe we may need to wait a bit to split the coins.
