Aww so disparaging. Is there a safe space you can get to quickly?

That sub is evidence that the amount of censorship here wasn't silly in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 08:42:53
Good stuff. We need to have it raise to at least 0.30$ and with SegWit this is almost in sustainable territory. 
@_date: 2016-04-05 20:40:28
That thing basically doesn't exist.

I don't know what the technical definition is for edit war, just that a wrong definition remains and there's a "disputed" tag.
@_date: 2016-04-11 20:04:39
They've removed it from the definition of block chain.

I bet posts addressing mods personally go straight to the moderation queue and won't show until approved. Which would be perfectly reasonable.

Is that so? In any case they've been around for considerably longer in the case of Coinbase.

As someone who visits and deals in the ground in Africa and Latin America, I think your views are extremely unrealistic. 
The people who have access to Bitcoin there can not only pay high fees but also run nodes and mine with decent ASIC operations. This mythical scenario where a starving child is saved by lower on chain transaction fees simply doesn't exist. The dollar is much better for that job in these scenarios and it's not harder to get than bitcoin but rather the opposite.

@_date: 2017-02-07 18:43:32
Solid. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:47:45
Judging by the naming, they're related to the mining futures ideas from a while ago. Ways to mitigate variance and to estabilise profit when most of the mining reward will be fees (and therefore will clear up at the beginning of the blocks, making it only profitable to wait for fees to stack up before starting - unless there's a mecanism of deferred reward like these).
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:44:34

In Bittorrent I'm sovereign and in Netflix I'm just a subject, only allowed certain usage. The existence of the first is more important to me, and it would be so even if I used Netflix more. Because I can rely on it, therefore it's the for me when it's critical.

Many mainstramers don't get that being toxic against propagandist tactics is essential for a community like this one. Bitcoin will always be under attack on the social engineering front.
Having a bitcoin balance doesn't make you a member of the bitcoin community like having a dollar doesn't make you a member of the US$ community. 
If you want to be close to the deciders you have to be ready to challenge the nonsense **strongly** and also to be challenged and take some flak.

Coinbase is not Bitcoin, which is something a lot of people are not fully aware of. 
The main properties for which Bitcoin makes sense are lost if you fully depend on Coinbase for your transactions. 
It's the equivalent of having a broker account to trade in COMEX rather than having actual gold. It can be useful to speculate, and that's about it.

The pump part alone is only a scam if you are not truly behind it, which is not possible to establish from the outside. 
What OP said, which is something you can verify as every public bigblocker does pump some alt, is that they do pump. You added the scammer label. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:22:53
I didn't sign it and I don't support it. That's what my node cares about.

There's extra incentive now, because the RPC default is wrong with SegWit, and this is likely to be patched right away in 0.15.

@_date: 2017-01-29 20:35:03
And that's the limitations I was talking about at the beginning of the exchange 
Domestic bandwidth is limited and considerably more than the current blocksize is transferred by a well connected node. SegWit improves things somewhat, but still the bandwidth requirements are not trivial for a domestic connection, let alone if you double or quadruple the average blocksize. 
@_date: 2017-01-23 18:16:54
Seems to be always on the same substances then.

No, that's not at all the required bandwidth.

@_date: 2017-08-28 20:11:20
No reason to do that, they can signal whatever just fine. Maybe there's some correlation but it doesn't have to be dramatic. What's clear is that most miners follow the money and bcash shows that.

Good luck with Jeffcoin, JeffPay.
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:26:54
True, the fix is making smaller blocks than core  �� 
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:05:58
Bitcore adds some functions useful for payment processors. 
Bitcore itself is not the node. Its name leads to some confusion.
@_date: 2017-01-18 13:19:38
No, they don't have to. 
@_date: 2017-01-21 16:15:12
The objective would be to stay at 100%, so people don't periodically turn off their miners at the beginning of a block cycle when the block reward is tiny and fees take over. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:45:49
Have I read this exact comment elsewhere?
It's pretty simple really. You have established that the possibility to create a fork without replay protection means Bitcoin will fail. I don't think so, but the premise is true: this possibility is inherent to Bitcoin as designed. Therefore I cannot recommend it to you.

Nope. You can import the seed into whatever cheap clone cash wallet you want. Honoring every fork as if it was Bitcoin brings confusion and uncertainty.

I might be confused, but I think this isn't new at all.

Maybe some alts are profitable and you can convert to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:43:51
People running Bitcore are typically using SatoshiLabs' fork, as the original repo is essentially abandoned and AFAIR still stuck several versions behind and no SegWit support. 
May this serve as a reminder of that. 
Bitpay seems to be hollowed out, I don't even know what are they doing these days and how many full time engineers do they employ.

Compact/thin blocks defeat the purpose of being a full node. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:30:07
I don't think it's hard to use, but you do need a synced full node.
Alternatively you can try Electron Cash, but I don't trust them. I'd first transfer funds to another account, then use the spent addresses (not spent in the bcash chain). That should be easy enough.

If you stop running a full node to run a thin one, fewer nodes are actually distributing full blocks and the number of nodes you need to attack is smaller.

It's hard to determine exactly how much they are losing, since you can do much more AsicBoost optimisation in the other chain. 1:1 hashrate comparisons are likely misleading and some miners are likely losing much more than others.

@_date: 2015-08-27 19:23:25
Possibly. Bitcoin's price and transactions per second are not that correlated actually. If you look at the price for the last few years, it has declined as transactions have increased quite significantly.
So I wouldn't count on it as fact. It may reflect on price or not.
And also, 8MB blocks if they fill even at half they will take a very substantial toll on a domestic connection. In the ballpark of 400GB per month.

I wholly expect Core to put up a fight instead of allowing XT to take over the mining power.
Note that a shadow attack is possible among other things, indeed it's trivial if you control Core's code. It's something I'm sure they want to avoid though, because it would be a shitstorm. Still, as a desperate measure I don't rule it out at all. Not anytime soon though since Core has ~100% of the mining power.

@_date: 2015-08-16 16:56:17
A bigger limit, goes without saying. Miners won't fill the blocks with made up transactions.
The problem being that miners are forced to accept other mined nodes no matter how big, which can be a problem. If it couldn't be a problem, we wouldn't have any debate now.
Rather than have 8GB (max) blocks in 20 years why not just eliminating the limit? It would be much simpler and effectively the same. That is, if you want a limit such that it is completely ineffective to create a fee market. Then you don't need a limit at all.
I support basically every single alternative proposed ahead of the cludge that BIP 101 is. Including BIP 100, including a one-off, including the removal of the limit even. There are more sophisticated ideas about tackling scalability without a hard limit on the blocks but more effective activity measures, although maybe there's no time for that now with all this (unwarranted and artificially created) panic.
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:46:42
I fully agree with Peter Todd in that email. Gavin Andresen overstepped there and is actually not active for a long time already code-wise. He can still contribute like a normal contributor. Like, say, Drak. And he shouldn't have his own comments deleted from a pull-req either.
@_date: 2015-08-14 00:34:08
Ok, because what you said about the importance of self-sufficiency seemed to indicate minarchism, so it was plausible.
The problem with monarchies is that they lack checks and balances (talking about actual effective absolute monarchies). So you don't get to decide anything at all. How do you want the monarchy to work - big or small - effectively doesn't matter to the rulers. It only serves itself and secondarily everything else.

Maybe moving more options to the runtime environment would help. Also, have tests to determine the load your computer can take and set it up accordingly.
I'm a bit concerned about the incoming "stress tests". And if we start filling 2MB blocks, then I suspect the average load will be much higher than currently as well, in terms of RAM as well (regardless of that not being part of the consensus rules).

I see. Well, I'm going to be studying how to survive these kinds of attacks. I only run a node though, so maybe not a huge difference for the network.
I'd say an "expert" tab would be fine, scare most basic users from touching while allowing for easier override of the defaults.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:49:49
Please note that BitcoinXT introduces several features, many of them rejected in the past. BitcoinXT is not "bigger blocks", it's a lot more and a lot more concrete than that, and not necessarily for the best reasons.

@_date: 2015-08-29 13:42:19
I guess, but I was running the defaults. What will happen with current defaults if they spam the network? will many nodes start choking as I suspect?
@_date: 2015-08-18 22:05:22
There is no safe option about a fork without node coordination. There simply isn't.
Vote systems are "opt-in" and "at-will" currently. They are not cryptographically solid. In fact they are not even superficially solid. People think that they are as solid as a block signature but this is not the case, there is currently no protection to make them safe and they are just a field anyone can tamper: there is no mechanism to link a vote with an actual rule set. The whole thing about voting through version string or coinbase is weak because it's an afterthought.
First there would need to be a soft fork to incorporate a mechanism for voting that cannot be freely tampered with zero repercussions. Then maybe we could test it, not in the main blockchain, then maybe we could have this sort of vote. I say maybe because the legitimacy of the miners deciding for the whole system about anything and everything in the ruleset in itself is dangerous.
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:33:28
To push the single-gummybears-in-the-blockchain model you need to resort to this short-term fear mongering because otherwise the nature of the protocol and the limits to keep it decentralized will become more and more apparent.
His rhetoric of "keeping 1MB blocks a few months more is a more radical and dangerous approach than multiplying them by 8" may be evidently suspect for some of us, but it can work for people who have been prepared and thoroughly socially engineered in advance to believe it. Even when he brazenly pushes his rejected code in the same package and it's there in the open.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:07:06
Yep well, sometimes the democratic religion works like this.
"Let's democratically decide on this superdivisive thing so we can all agree to it". Sometimes a compromise is better than a "democratic decision" between two extremes that will divide the community so much that a lot of them will just abandon it to fight it from the outside.

Disingenuous and selfish, but completely understandable. He's just exploiting a flaw in Bitcoin's concrete PoW mechanism, and obviously he opposes a fix that losses him his competitive advantage. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:13:15
Fees are fundamental for sustainability of the mining system with no more incentives than the mining itself, long term. Adoption is not necessarily implied for that, other than the necessary adoption to produce that level of fees.
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:06:45
It's not a meaningful stat. It's not known how much balance a person holds by looking at addresses.

That sort of transaction is just much lower priority. If the network cannot support all small change transactions that you should use cash for anyway, then so be it.
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:39:52
Since 0.12 you can trivially limit the mempool.
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:49:42
Most home connections already struggle with 1MB for upload. Let alone mobile connections which are increasingly the norm  in poorer economies. 
Only a subset of the connections from a select group of countries can keep up without reduced peers or throttling.
The PC is generally not the bottleneck here. 
@_date: 2017-04-02 15:34:00
That, again, is meaningless. How much do you usually carry on your wallet has zero relevance for channels. 
Having people using block space more efficiently will never be a net loss as long as there's demand for block space. 
Opposing this technology is simply stupid unless you want Bitcoin to stagnate.
@_date: 2017-04-06 19:23:59
There's clearly a flaw if selfish behaviour from the miners conflicts with bug fixing and optimal operation of transactions.

High availability is only an issue when the miners benefit from it, so they can have a deal with a single provider on a couple of different locations. High availability is not what Bitcoin decentralisation is meant to provide. Bcash is probably a different story.

It's not the case that people can know how much do you have and trace previous owners of your coins. You can trace - to some degree and depending on the collaboration the participants provide - inputs and outputs. So long as you can create as many addresses as you want and join inputs with third parties as you wish, you can launder your coins at will.
Right now, being denied service because of your coins past is less of a problem than being denied service because monero isn't taken at all. 
Supposing monero was a free and easy way to hide your activity you can also atomic swap to monero and back to new addresses. But that isn't even necessary. You have plenty of mechanisms.

The only reason Bitcoin doesn't use monero style transactions is because they're much bigger and would fill blocks even much more. Monero belongs in sidechains/drivechains backed by bitcoin because it scales much worse. 
I've read plenty on monero, it's cool. But I don't think it will take over as a reserve of value and I have no problems laundering my coins thoroughly.

If they tried to buy that amount they'd drive the price up massively, so the price you're quoting is pointless.

I'm relatively new to reddit and to but as far as I can see, moderation is relatively lenient regarding insults and trolling.
Some people around here have been name-calling the mods for a while, for instance aquentin directly to Theymos, and he hasn't been banned yet.
If I were mod these would be banned for a long time by now.
As for XT, blocksize, etc. there's a constant rain of posts for several days now. The rules are being completely ignored, and most people remain here for whatever reason.
This post for instance is strictly against the sub rules, it should have been posted in the sticker.
Seems to me like some of you are trying really, really hard to get banned to have something to feel *euphoric* about.

So you make it directly advantageous for the pools to merge and then hope they don't merge down to 1 for the market to work?
Isn't it a disaster already if we have only 2 or 3 pools for resistance to regulatory pressure?
If that market works against decentralization, its endgame is the end of Bitcoin as we know it. A centralized Bitcoin is completely pointless.

It sounds to me like a perfect use case for a side chain or LN of some sort. There are changes there that would be very dramatic and full of trade-offs if adopted for the whole main blockchain, like much slower validation of the zero-knowledge proof step.

It's not, also these txs are going nowhere, they are still in the backlog.
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:26:50
Miners try to protect the ecosystem, despite the doomsday selfish miners scenarios. They are heavily invested longer term, for the most part.
Given that these fees are still low compared to block reward and they'd still add them at a loss, they make a small sacrifice in terms of profit to prevent very long backlogs of legit txs (that could belong to new bitcoiners).
Within a certain margin it makes collective sense.

This is partly why I'm pretty sure the chain would remain forked and we would end up with two incompatible cryptos. There is no way these factions would willingly reunite. It's perfectly possible to change the retargeting and even the PoW algorithm to keep them independent.

You see, that implicitly concedes that has become into a sort of . One wasn't supposed to come here for a balanced account on the fight between factions, but to read on Bitcoin news and technology. I can't stand the politics, much rather have two separate subs for each faction than one sub where the only topic is the constant war and the same arguments repeated over and over again.
My understanding is that the mods who spend a lot of time here also cannot stand this any more. I definitely can't, and I'm much happier that there is and than trying to reconcile both. Can't believe anyone truly thinks this is possible without a descend into this absolute constant shit. It's come to a point that reading some arguments repeated makes me physically ill, wanting to punch someone. And I'm sure people on the other end of the spectrum feel the same way. This is not good and I personally prefer it to stop. So this is a step in the right direction.

On the one hand you say mass adoption any time now and show tables with massive tps rates, on the other hand you say 20 years. Which is it? 8MB in two months is enough to massively cull nodes but not for any sort of mass adoption as plain transactions in the chain. You know this, right? 
@_date: 2015-11-11 17:20:34
Exchange Bitcoin is regulated. I prefer OTC myself and always mix it for laundry for good measure.

This is Satoshi's cap. In any case I do resent losing the ability to run my node and that others may lose it too.
I vote against BIP101 both with my node and my hashing, and whenever asked. I believe the current state of the network doesn't allow for such a change. I know you disagree and although I don't want anyone to be frustrated I will keep defending my own vision.
Honestly I think you guys should seriously consider forking with checkpoints and a different PoW, if you feel as strongly about your vision as I feel about mine.

To be fair transactions with multiple outputs are equivalent to multiple transactions in other systems. One would have to count outputs that are not change to the owner of the inputs, but this is generally just a guess. Then it's better, still never competitive with a centralized microtransaction processor but better than 3-7 transactions per second.

It doesn't make sense that the scale of the graphic is logarithmic and the color scale is based in the linear value. There's a strong mismatch.
Also I think it's good form to avoid sensational titles like "sinking deeper in the red zone", together with colors that show subjective preference towards a target.
Remember that the point is having more transactional capacity and that block size itself is not a target but rather a burden and a trade-off.

Any mechanism will be central is a way. Even the market itself. Fees need to rise to be comparable with current block rewards, or the system is toast. It's simple as that. If we try to force super-low fees by forcing more free work on miners that they are not sufficiently compensated to do, we may destroy the system.


The system works with 1MB limits. What you say is that touching that in the absence of evidence is wrong? Or this argument only works the other way?

I used to think so, but now I think his complete ostracism is a much, much better outcome. His politics, lobbying, "aggressive minority" strategies, etc. are very unlikely to render much end product as he's basically more of a nobody every day. 
He could do this much damage until now because he had built some sort of name within the community. That made it hard to dismiss his bullshit without getting some flak back for it. Now it's becoming increasingly easier. So much so even "not dictatorial enough Wumpus" (according to MH) finally banned him from the chat room. 
Personality building is dangerous for Bitcoin. Very dangerous, when anybody does it - as they become a distinct target - and even much more so when it's a toxic element like MH.

Gavin has always believed in a "legit" centralized Bitcoin. This is not new, he also thinks common end users should not be nodes, and in his entire view of the system a transition towards data centers and government institutions has always been in the horizon. He also knew there would be resistance to this from those who don't agree with him in this ideal, and from those who experienced running their own nodes and being able to push any transactions from any sources to the network and expect them to be included without any other considerations than fees. He's right, we will resist that.
@_date: 2015-10-24 15:23:14


It's also not the first time you've advocated for devs to help law enforcement. Law enforcement in the transaction/protocol layer means implicit permission for the transactions themselves.
@_date: 2015-10-18 11:01:59
We have a 1MB for quite some time, since Satoshi added it. We've hit it in 3 separate attacks, and dare I say as a node runner and miner that it worked.
I'm off this convo, no offence but I have had it many times and it gets nowhere. Maybe worth having a reference set of points and counter-points somewhere but in this format this is a waste of time.

1MB is currently reasonable as a cap, I can agree to that.
@_date: 2015-10-17 12:33:42
Block size cap is currently fixed to 1MB and at this point it seems unlikely that any change will happen in that regard so soon. After an agreement is achieved by the Core devs, there would be a deployment plan and it's likely to take months. 
However, currently most Bitcoin transactions by far occur outside of the blockchain (for instance in exchanges and trading systems) and in the longer term there would be other cryptographic solutions to help unload the main blockchain.
Catastrophic scenarios from having blocks filled don't seem to follow logic or observation. Once blocks get full and we have a large backlog, AND the current situation where most transactions pay ridiculously low fees stops happening, THEN we'd have a strong capacity problem.
It's doubtful that all these situations would happen overnight, but as a gradual process. Note that an attack is not economically feasible when the average fee is not ridiculously low, even with "just" 1MB blocks. They would be very short lived.
I'm confident Bitcoin will continue progressing and the current irrational panic will be overcome.

I believe Avalons allow that.
ASICminers only do Ethernet natively, you'd need a wifi bridge if that's a problem. They can be pointed directly to some Stratum pools like Slush or Eligius but I don't know how effective is that.
Frankly I don't think such low potential profit (struggle to even recover the 50 bucks in a dog's lifetime) justifies the hassle. Hence why nobody is selling equipment at this price point.

Precisely because we know that the current incentive won't  last forever. That's why we cannot load miners and nodes without control and not expect a shift towards centralization.
It's a model, it's just not the one I want.

EDIT: maaku7 confirms the ML is not moderated at this time, so he's not banned and still there.
Upon seeing the thread where I found this, which was downvoted heavily by guess which brigade (  ) I was reading chat logs and I got the impression that he was banned elsewhere too.
Browsing through the ML archives, MH stops replying yesterday noon despite having a couple ownages to his name. 
I'm in the ML myself, but I don't know how to check for bans. Only clue I have is that they seem to imply so.
So no, I'm not really sure but I believe he may be banned there too, or somewhere else. Still looking for some confirmation.

Honestly I don't think I'm following you.
The current cap will help with the transition on its own, but naturally any other scalability improvement should also be welcome. When bigger blocks are negligible for consumer broadband and storage, increasing the cap is very low risk and an easy scalability bump.

I'd evaluate what makes more sense to use. For groceries I'd definitely use cash with a much stronger incentive if CC costs were that high.
The point here is that transactions are not free and we are just moving the costs to the subsidy or to other motivations different than just the fees. People are acting as if block size was not a cost to pay, a resource that costs to use... and therefore any fee is too high and arbitrary. That's a massive problem for the sustainability of the system. Transactions need to ultimately pay for themselves sooner or later, or else the system won't survive with its current properties.

There's been talk about it in the dev list for at least 2 years that I remember.
It's just not a trivial problem by any means.
Faking you have a node is trivial. Systems like Dash have a list of masternodes with stake, but they introduce a central manager for that. So, not something that would go well or easily if you try to introduce it to Bitcoin.
There are other ideas but trust me, if it was a simple thing to do it would have been done.

Frankly I don't think so. If anything, short term I'd move it downwards. But I would surrender some upwards movement just so you guys let us talk about something else for a while. 2MB would probably not be catastrophic, so I'd take the risk. The harassment is unbearable and the mods are caving to pressure. If you go to 8MB the harassment would happen the other way. It's a nightmare trying to talk about Bitcoin these days. Thanks Mike.

I'd be surprised if the Windows client wasn't the most popular. Yes, the blockchain is massive but that's hardly a Windows-only problem. Also, a lot of people think the blockchain is not growing fast enough and want even more tiny transactions happen directly in the blockchain.

If you say that subsidisation is a feature that will have to be kept no matter the burden instead of transitioning towards market sustainability without exiting capacity, then yes that Bitcoin model is broken and its days are numbered. That's why I don't advocate allowing the burden to grow without limits before market mechanisms appear or are put in place via design tweaks.
@_date: 2015-10-17 16:39:37
That's not realistic because older models are too slow to mine efficiently without a stratum proxy or similar breaking up work units for it.
You'd end up mining mostly stales or with such high variance you'd likely never mine at all.
