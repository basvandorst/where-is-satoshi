Who told you bitcoin was perfect? That is hardly the consensus of this sub and definitely not the consensus of the community as a whole. Bitcoin is an experiment, we all decide for ourselves how well we think it is going. Like he said, if you want to use it go ahead *it's there*. If you do not want to use it, don't use it. The world will go on and people who want to use bitcoin will use bitcoin.

You are trying to make sense of something that does not make sense. The blockchain and bitcoin are not two separate things. Bitcoin and the blockchain can not exist in its present form without bitcoin the units that are mined. 
The blockchain is almost like a decentralized autonomous corporation. Miners work to secure the network for monetary reward. This is what makes it decentralized and secure, all miners work toward the same goal but at the same time have individual incentive.

This comment is a trigger for me, but the upvotes it is receiving is an indicator. I think I will cry for 2 more weeks and then buy a bitcoin for 275 doll hairs.

I have never had coins stolen from me and I am completely clueless about security.

Yeah or you know people have differing opinions.

Right but mining is what secures the network. Specifically decentralized mining that has incentive for the miner.
