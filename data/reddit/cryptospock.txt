That's probably Obama running up the debt, not QE.
"In its third round of QE, the Fed says it will buy $40 billion in MBS every month for an indefinite period.  To do this, it will essentially create money from nothing, paying for its purchases by crediting the reserve accounts of the banks from which it buys them.  *The banks will get the dollars and the Fed will get the MBS.  But the banks’ balance sheets will remain the same, and the circulating money supply will remain the same.* "
From 
"And that is where we are now: despite repeated rounds of QE, there is still too little money chasing too many goods. The current form of QE is merely an asset swap: dollars for existing financial assets (federal securities or mortgage-backed securities). The rich are getting richer from bank bailouts and very low interest rates, but the money is not going into the real economy, which remains starved of the funds necessary to create the demand that would create jobs."

Guess the poster also posted this on Dashpay, just saw this. Weirdly connecting negative yields with QE, even though the QE has stopped (AFAIK) and there is no negative US government bond yields. It is a local phenomenon not global. But perhaps if your crypto is inflating at &gt; 10%, it might be good to point fingers elsewhere even though QE doesn't inflate the money supply (else there wouldn't be negative interest rates).

Money is debt and created through debt. We are talking about who created the money not who controls it. Indeed it is created for the bankers but they don’t create by themselves

isn’t there a rule for commercial activity that would not allow this?

Trying to specify a solution to just a inflationary or deflationary currency over simplifies the complexity of the economy. You need a currency that can respond to cycles in the economy and have some degree of ability to expand AND contract when needed. Even having a stable population is not enough, as you could have waves of different age groups that will influence the velocity of money over time.
