Sure, but that's a slightly different question. ***If***  increasing adoption and increasing bitcoin revenue for Overstock start to happen, then it would make sense for them to start pressuring suppliers. Very much a day-to-day management decision for them.

I wasn't being entirely rigorous, perhaps, in distinguishing between personal bankruptcy and a company in administration; but the principle is the same in both cases: ***everything*** that may have value can be seized. No exceptions. In the corporate case, the directors have to tread very carefully indeed - any suspicion of illicit asset-juggling will have the court down on them like bricks.
To return to the original point, Bitcoin is definitely a seizable asset, and definitely falls under the bankruptcy laws.

No. By "utility" I mean, loosely, the volume of trade in the real economy (which is what counts). To maintain a particular daily volume of transactions, you need a particular quantity of Bitcoin, assuming constant velocity. That portion (the non-speculative bit)  of the price absolutely is determined by demand, for facilitating trade. Doge coin doesn't come close.

Big retail companies have their suppliers over a barrel. When Walmart or Tesco or Overstock crack the whip and yell "Jump!", suppliers hit the ceiling or go out of business. And then they go to *their* suppliers on down the chain and spread the nasty around some more. Everybody gets some.

In a bankruptcy (in the UK, and indeed most countries - almost certainly including Japan) ***all*** the bankrupt's assets, not just bank accounts, go in the bag. Your house, your car, your work tools, intellectual property, business goodwill, stock-in-trade, shares, even illegally-acquired drugs, absolutely ***anything*** owned or controlled by the bankrupt. They can, quite literally, make you turn out your pockets.
Bankruptcy trustees and executors are professionals at tracking down and realising assets - probably more expert than the taxman. And they have serious legal muscle. Bitcoin was the central asset, along with fiat deposits, of Gox. No way in hell they don't legally count in Gox's list of assets. And if Karpeles is shown to be monkeying with those assets while a director/owner of a bankrupt entity without authorisation (and it's far too early for that; these things take years to resolve) they will throw his arse in jail.

No. Democracy is under threat and in decline in the EU. So leaving it in order to become, once again, a true democracy, rather than a province of the Empire, increases the net quality of democracy in Europe and lessens the (already remote, you've heard of NATO, right?) chance of war.
On the other hand violent separatism within nations can be a real threat to peace - ask the Spanish, or the Northern Irish, or the ex-Yugoslavs. Neither the EU in itself, nor democracy in affected nations is demonstrably a remedy against it.
Not to mention, of course, the real and present danger of Islamic terorism, which has largely been made possible by lunatic immigration policy associated with the EU.

FWIW, I'm a land-surveyor and engineer. At work my natural units of measurement are  metres and millimetres. A size of, say, 0.067 mm is automatically expressed in speech as "sixty-seven mils", or on paper as either "0.067" or "67", with the distinction clear in context. I've taken to using the same idiom for bitcoin. Works for me.
Fractions of mils on paper as "0.067 54" (note space), or "67.54 mils".

Yeah, I've been chewing on this deflation thing for a while, because it's the one aspect of the BTC phenomenon that *does* look a little dicy, right enough. Spherius's take seems to make sense, and one of my Rules for Living is "Find out what Krugman thinks, then take the opposite opinion.", so I'm encouraged.
One datapoint: there's one sector of the economy where effective deflation is an ongoing fact of life - consumer electronics. Everybody expects electronic stuff - PCs, phones, game-boxes, whatever - to be cheaper next month. As far as I can tell that doesn't hurt sales one bit. Generally, people buy at the best price they can get on the day when they need it; and a price drop will generally see an increase in sales. So there doesn't seem to be a "deflation" problem, at least in the consumer-goods sector.

On JR's "Why Bitcoin is doomed" post:
Some Americans are unclear on the concept of a place that isn't America.
300 million Americans. 6000 million non-Americans. A couple of hundred or so separate sovereign entities. Even the federal govenment is going to have trouble with that scenario. A War on Bitcoin will turn into a replay of the War on Some Drugs - that is, it will be conducted vigorously and viciously over a very long time in order to protect powerful vested interests; but ultimately it will prove futile.
Afterthought: The WoSD is mandated by the disastrous [Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]( international treaty of 1961. If the US Govt does take the "stamp it out" option, there will be immediate moves to set up something similar on digital currencies. Keep your eyes peeled.

Never forget that the general populace contains a lot - maybe a majority - of left-statist nitwits who see financial success and unequal wealth distribution as Just Obviously, Outrageously Wrong. If Bitcoin really goes stratospheric, and creates a class of millionaires with untouchable, untaxable assets - then 'ware pitchforks.

Horse-feathers. Sea level is rising at about 3 mm a year (see  - *the* authoritative source) if measured by satellites; less, according to tide-gauge data. It's been doing that since at least 1850, well before CO2 emissions were any sort of a problem, so it doesn't follow that that SLR is due to any anthropogenic "global warming". In the 20th century total SLR was 200 mm (8 inches, to readers in Arkansas) which we dealt with by not noticing it. It's demonstrably not accelerating. So by 2050, we can expect further SLR of around 80 mm. Enough depth to fill a fuckin' Dixie-cup. That won't create one climate refugee, let alone 200 million. Take a pill.

Meh. The Brasilian excitement seems like more of what we've already seen in Greece and Spain.
Theses numpties are breaking windows and burning dumpsters because they've been taught and convinced that they're entitled to Free Shit from the Gubmint, no matter what. Their politicians promised them more FSftG, because that's the only way there is to get elected, and they want their FSftG like NOW!!!, and they'll want more FSftG tomorrow. One or two of the smarter incendiaries will have enough rude understanding of cause-and-effect to essay an answer to the question of "Who's going to pay for all this?" 
"Why, the rich bastards and the banks of course", they'll reply, and burn a few people to death inside a bank building, as they did not too long ago in Greece, to illustrate and reinforce their point.
These insurrections (and there are plenty more in the pipeline) are left-wing, statist and inimical to capital. That they are fundamentally wrong about everything doesn't make them any less dangerous or destructive. They are not good news for liberty.

Don't look at it that way - there's plenty of room for everybody in the entrepreneurial space.
I've been thinking about this too. If a "colored coin" (a single satoshi?) can represent a fiat unit, then you have a basis for a P2P exchange in fiat. You could build a banking system *denominated in fiat* on that, set up your own bank (appropriately capitalised, of course) and maybe even sell it to a regular bricks-and-mortar retail bank. Market it as something like "As trusted as a dollar, as smooth as a Bitcoin."

Fractional reserve banking. Gonna happen.
FRB, by repeated re-lending, can  - does - increase the money-in-circulation by a factor of about 10. So that means there will eventually be 210 million BTC in circulation (1 actual BTC + 9 BTC accounting units in banks), not 21 m. That *in itself* isn't a problem. The problem shows up when the base money-supply is inflated (called "quantitative easing" this week). That still doesn't happen with Bitcoin.

Update: Fokken dom. Jy het dit reg. 'n Duur les.

Thank you for the explanation. You can tell your associates that there is at least one customer out there who will buy from your site in BTC but not in USD. Best wishes, and congratulations on doing a great job advancing Bitcoin.

I think he might have omitted a /s flag.

That is indisputably true; it led you to call me liar; and you have neither retracted nor apologised. I repeat: you're a stupid, dishonest prick.
I see no percentage in continuing a correspondence with an obvious psychiatric case with too much time on his hands, on a dead thread, any further.
Good day to you.

Yup, did it by the book. Generated the address using bitaddress.org (JavaScript) while disconnected from Internet. Wrote the pass phrase in my work diary, c&amp;p'd the address to my blockchain wallet for the initial transfer. That's it.
I don't see where the size of the balance would be relevant - if the black-hat is just grinding through the world's text until he generates an address with a balance in it, he'll take what's there, 0.001 or 1000 BTC. "if bal(address)&gt;0 then sweep(address)".
