Knock on wood, Fucker.

I think you are wrong and grossly underestimate the reach of the governmental domestic spying.
They absolutely have access to all of your internet traffic and device usage.
You also underestimate the willingness of the legal system to err in the favor of the government.

Bitcoin has become very traceable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:52:48
They will seize funds because of used it before you.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:09:57
He right.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:08:48
Where was this predicted and by whom?
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:59:24
Are you really this stupid?
You are the greatest case I've witnessed for paid shills existence.

You have all convinced me that I was wrong. It is not a matter of opinion. 
If bitcoin is defined by the white paper, BCH is bitcoin.
Segwit clearly violates a central tenant by removing witness data.

Being excited about paying twice for something is highly unlikely.

Whoa. Is that what I said?
Why shouldn’t I use BCH instead of spending so much more to establish a Second Layer solution?
Any second layer solution that works could be applied to BCH later if desired, and BCH works more efficiently now!
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:35:08
So you don’t mean that it was predicted by anyone special; you mean that it is an obvious eventuality.
I agree. 
I think BCH has a higher intrinsic value.

How is he misleading newcomers to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:07:59
There will be no moon. Not for bitcoin. How can there be a future when it is slow and expensive? 
It’s useless.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:17:24
You could have avoided all the extra effort and just used BCH. 
Fact.
