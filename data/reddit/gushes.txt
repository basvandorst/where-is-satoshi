Could be a man in the middle attack.... where he's somehow editing the information during the release.  
There are dozens of reports where users are getting their accounts drained immediately after a coin release.

Wow... people are REALLY trying to cover this up.  Coindesk links here then says that no one with 2FA is affected.
And there has been 232 downvotes.... Why in the world is this being downvoted?

It looks like Don4of4 was making multiple small purchases in very short time period.  As if he was trying to capture some information during the "release" process.

One is Lamassu, which I have in my van driving around Charleston trying to find a host, the other 5 are "InterWallet" and will be here by the end of this month.  If you're thinking about buying a Lamassu, Don't.  It's not remotely manageable, or even remotely monitored.  Only way to track how much you've sold is to go to the block chain for the wallet on the machine (that Lamassu holds control of the private keys)  InterWallet are cheaper and do more.  Oh ya, my company operates bitcoin ATMs for anyone that wants to buy one but doesn't want have to manage it.  (Except Lamassu, I won't touch another one of their products until they get they acts together)

Sorry, California money transmitter laws are excessively expensive to comply with.  If they come out and state I don't need a license to operate a bitcoin vending machine, I'm definitely looking for a place in San Fransisco.  Selling bitcoin isn't money transmission, but that has never stopped people from getting harassed.

From me.  ^ _ ^  I'll be deploying BTMs nationwide throughout this coming year, starting in Texas.

Cash In Bitcoin Out is the owner of this machine, and Zenbox is the operator.

I'm focusing on San Antonio right now.  Know any bitcoin friendly business owners?  I'm paying a bounty of 1% of the profits from that location to anyone that can secure a hosting contract.

No.  I'm an operator.  I buy BTMs and operate them, as well as operating for clients that own their own.  BitcoinVendingInternational.com

This is the actual "atm" listing for this machine.  
I've also posted it on Coin desk.  
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:15:09
Lol, I wouldn't go that far.  More like 30ish over the next few months, hundreds will take about 12-18 months.

After seeing Charleston, I will not be placing there, instead all 6 will be going to Texas.

Bitcoin ATMs "BTMs"  Automated machines that sell bitcoin for cash.

"Skyhook is Cash in, BTC out."
Sorry, but I already have that trademarked.  CashInBitcoinOut.com.  ^_^  
FYI, the company managing my BTMs is trying out your Skyhook, if it's something they can work with, I'll probably buy a couple hundred over the next 3 months.

Sign was made by the malls, not by Zenbox and not by the owner.  Simon Malls have full control over the advertising within the malls they own.

I'm working closely with Aric, the founder and developer of InterWallet.
