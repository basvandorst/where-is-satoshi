Second headline kinda makes it seem like it wasn't below $1,000 for a very long time so yay? Idk

Invest an amount you are willing to lose. Buy what you can, and invest a little more every now and again, maybe 2-3% of a paycheck. You most likely won't miss that little amount, and it can grow exponentially

Kinda feel like this reply was way out of line. It was an honest question about an irregularity in the pricing. One that actually has an interesting answer. No need to be degrading to someone trying to learn more about bitcoin and how it works.

I'm getting 750sol/s average on my 1080ti. Shame this week the profits are down to about $2.50/day, 2 weeks ago it was easily $3.50/day

You seem to be misunderstanding how things work. If you were going to buy $100 of product, you owe Amazon $100 worth of whatever currency you choose to use. If you buy $100 of Bitcoin, and use that, it is EXACTLY the same as using $100 usd. The only difference is that you will be supporting the blockchain by using Bitcoin. Now, if you're using Bitcoin you already have in your wallet, that is a different story, and that's what I think you're thinking of.

Not with bitcoin. However, look into ZCash. Mining altcoins is the ONLY way you will ever see profit.

Think they said it would only use 30% only on one tab
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:11:38
It's not malware and if you don't like it, don't go to the site. They even said you can block it with an Adblock. But it's sure as hell better than all the porn ads that pop up when you visit it. And as a miner myself, I applaud them finding a way that lets them keep the site clean and lets people opt-out. Do some research please.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:27:25
I would use it exclusively if I could
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:51:21
Does something that never installs on your machine count as a virus? I would think not.
If you don't like it, don't go to the site. Simple as that. You control if you let them and for how long. Want them to stop? Close the tab. As for the power costs, have you seen some of the flash based ads that are on websites nowadays? I've seen them take up 50+% of processors up to right about the i3 level. Your increase in power costs would be negligible if you could even notice it at all. Run an adblocker if you can't live without the site. Your alternative is more intrusive and obnoxious ads. No one is forcing anyone to mine for them. It is completely by choice. Let me repeat myself, it is by choice. Nothing is installed on your machine and nothing is left after you close the browser. Not a virus, not malware. If it's a little bit of unused CPU horsepower and MAYBE a penny/month increase in my power bill as opposed to intrusive pornographic ads that repeatedly open new windows and play sounds, I think that's a pretty okay trade. They have to make money somehow, at least this way betters the crypto scene while they do it.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:30:55
Yeah sure, go ahead

I used to mine with NiceHash, but found that it would often switch away from ZCash, which was by far the most profitable by their own estimates. When I switched to exclusively mining ZCash, I found my returns went up almost immediately
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:36:08
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:03:54
Yeah, it's unfortunate, but I see much better returns away from NiceHash. Don't get me wrong, it's great for beginners, but if you look around you'll find that that's more common than you'd think
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:47:54
I bought mine for $700
@_date: 2017-09-18 23:13:42
You do you dude. Sounds like you don't go to the site anyways, so you don't have a dog in the fight at all. I'm willing to do it. If you're not, great for you. I'm well aware of the "risks". If you pirate on your main machine, or you're not doing regular OS re-installs, chances are you're going to get viruses way more nasty than a little mining. Some of us see this as a good thing. I'm not going to stoop to your level and insult you based on an opinion. Have a good one mate.

Buy Bitcoin for the exclusive purpose of using it in a transaction on Amazon. Same as buying using cash except you support the blockchain. Not sure why you'd be kicking yourself about that. That money was already going to be spent at Amazon.
