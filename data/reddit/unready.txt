$1 in bitcoin = $1
$100 in bitcoin = $100
I feel like you're asking why $100 bills are so expensive when there's no logic or science or statistics that make it worth more than a $1 bill - it's all just paper, and for bitcoin, it's all just bits

you're doing it wrong. bitcoin is a *currency* not an investment

Has Mt. Gox completely crashed yet? **Pretty much - 
I know China has been working to ban BTC, is this likely going to be anytime soon? **Not fully, but it doesn't look good**
Is there still a shitstorm brewing? **Shitstorms are a daily occurrence.**

in theory, yes, but not from what i've seen in reality.
i doubt that will change going forward. every middle man wants his piece of the pie.

the protocol can't be regulated.
exchanges, marketplaces, and payment systems can, and without those you don't have a currency.

Your last sentence is right on,but not everyone can mine.
I feel like the invention of ASIC's really hurt bitcoin. For some, there is no way to use bitcoin without a 3rd party.

buy a little now, if it keeps going down, keep buying a little at a time. otherwise, there will always be some lower target to "hold out for" and you'll miss the boat completely.

I didn't downvote, but [citation needed]

Yes, very cool idea. Eliminates the chargeback problem because giftcards aren't refundable I guess?
This would be great for spreading to the less tech savvy

That's not how it works. The signature is generated based on the text, and can be verified against the public key.

Are these vouchers to redeem for btc at current spot price?

A lot of people say this - but I don't understand, if gox freezes withdrawals, the people there would panic, but those are the exact same people that CAN'T sell at all right now. So how is the drop due to gox?

Look up paper wallets. Basically you can print out a private key -at the end of the day it's just a long sequence of letters and numbers that gives you acess to funds in an address.

I believe each transaction causes a beep. There is a speaker icon that you can click to turn this off.

gold is just as divisible as bitcoin.

Why are you making a simple ad for Sochi seem like some conspiracy?

In my opinion, bitcoin will never replace credit cards and most people will never get paid in bitcoin.
That's okay! Bitcoin can still prosper and be highly useful to the entire world as something that just doesn't exist today - cash for the internet.

FUD.
