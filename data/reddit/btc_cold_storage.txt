I know what your saying. The issue is not the 15% of the gains tax. Yes you keep 85% of your gainz. It’s that you have to report each transaction you make which is never gonna fly for mass adoption. Will your mom want to file each grocery visit on her annual taxes? What do you think?  
I hodl 8k worth of BTC so trying to flesh this idea out to gain better idea of mass adoption.

Barter is illegal. Barter with taxes is legal. Glad I had to spell it out for you. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:56:42
It’s illegal if you don’t pay capital gains tax on top of sales tax 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:58:00
That would be nice but let’s face it we’re dealing with taxes. Gubment loves it’s revenue. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:46:46
Yea agree just gotta hodl 
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:31:29
? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:03:53
See earlier post 
It’s not a problem of laws but instead a power struggle between crypto users and the gubment on the legitimacy of two money supplies.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:54:57
Taxes will only be taken out of gains exactly. That’s capital GAINS tax. Please refer to my original post. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:27:27
Yep. Now Japan considers it currency. America, no, but still gold which is nice.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:31:41
Yes! Experienced TA scientist here. That’s a “TA is garbage tier analysis don’t fucking try it” pattern.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:15:44
Legally yea
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:11:23
Because it’s not considered legal tender by the gubment, yes. Yes it is a taxable event.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:50:28
Your so smart! You think people got into bitcoin when they made a Reddit username! 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:15:18
Agreed, there’s one that someone’s trying to get passed for under 600 dollars. We’ll see but not super hopeful 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:27:28
I think we’ll see a drop in price around tax season when mainstream starts churning FUD about this 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:41:26
At worst case I see it near parity with gold. That’s 9 trillion. So that divided by 21 million BTC is 428k per BTC. In like 20 years I definitely see that happening. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:24:04
Good point BTC is global 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:14:01

@_date: 2018-01-21 01:07:28
Just as funny the second way up 
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:43:57
You’re wrong in the following - not everybody’s gonna make 100% return. It’s literally impossible. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:36:46
Fuck taxes suck 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:22:45
I think that will be a good stepping stone towards true legitimacy.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:21:49
Yeah sales tax 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:05:29
.... ok I’ll spell it out. Gubment likes their money. We like our money. Whoever wins the power struggle will have the laws written in their favor. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:29:41

@_date: 2017-12-29 01:37:18

Fucking love it. My thoughts exactly. It’s always the same fucking dumb response about FDIC that you can count on 100% to shill fiat. And they always fight back hard like they’re the fed fucking chairman of fiat. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 02:52:48
Nice, you’re proving my point 
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:15:13
