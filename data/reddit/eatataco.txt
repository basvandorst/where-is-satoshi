IMO (basically, based off of what I read from other people), cryptocurrencies have one potentially fatal flaw: the fact that there is a limited amount of them encourages people not to spend them, because people develop this sense that they are worth more than they are actually worth.  It's viewed too much as an investment and while investing like something in Yahoo! might also be viewed as an investment *it actually is generating revenue/value another way.*  In the case of Yahoo!, it is by selling advertisement space.
For Bitcoin to truly catch on, people have to go out and spend it.  But people, like you likely, won't spend it because you think it is "undervalued."  To you, using it now would be "selling low" and you don't want to do that!  It's a long term investment.  The problem is, are *most* people viewing it this way?
If not enough people are using it to buy things, then it does truly lose a lot of its value because it's *only* value is when it is used to buy things.
So I don't think it needs to be either.  It might just not have much value right now because people aren't treating it as if it is something that actually has value, but only potential future value.

The problem is that it has to be spent to save people money.  If everyone holds onto it, it saves nothing and thus any valuation based on savings to consumers is completely bunk.
If a lot of people are betting that the market cap is higher than it currently is, so they hold or buy, then that savings is realized even less, which further drives the price down, which further makes the savings less realized.
It has to be spent to have any value and if too many people view it as an investment, we're all going to have a bad time.

Why are 3 and 5 not valid concerns?
