Quantum computing will break bitcoin in 1-3 years. They could just wait it out unless we move faster. I need to spend more time on that quantum safe blockchain code and for someone to double check my math (avoiding a duplicate problem like sec256k1 being insecure vs side channel attacks).

I'm all for innovation via alt-coins. I'm doing this myself by working on a bunch of privacy layers around smart contracts. However there is a fundamental difference between an alt coin and an alt fork, where the number of limited coins is immediately doubled. Alt-forks should be attacked with dump sales on exchanges, followed by a 51% attack that forges emptying the exchange wallets holding the altfork. Alt-forks are immoral and wrong. If you want to innovate, please do. Don't invent a few billion dollars and create a PR campaign specifically designed to legitimize your theft of hashrate combined with massive inflation of a limited resource.

I think alt-forks should be attacked by a mining pool that does a 51% attack against the exchanges, draining them of funds by false consensus. I say that against alt-forks because they just double, tripled, quadrupled the amount of bitcoin in circulation if they are allowed to exchange. So there is 21 mil bitcoin total... unless someone decides to alt-fork another 21mil into existence every month.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:42:45
It is a currency that doubles in size and drops in value every alt-fork.

That's printing bitcoin from thin air, not an upgrade. Fiat bitcoin is not bitcoin, or bitcoin will simply have a new blockchain fork every month. Get a few billion dollars for lying? Why won't everyone do this! Fake news for the win!
There is no innovation that can occur when alt-forks constantly copy the ledger. I fully endorse alt-coins that start from 0 and provide actual innovation. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:31:37
Any alt-fork is a hostile attack, alt-coins need to start from 0. Otherwise bitcoin-fiat created by a copy paste means bitcoin itself is worthless, and the winner is whoever has the best paid shills marketing campaign.
Mining pools should 51% attack these alt-fork fiat coins and drain the wallet of any exchange that accepts them.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:25:06
a better future when alt-forking keeps creating bitcoin equivalents from thin air?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:29:44
It can scale, but it shouldn't have to. Bitcoin can be the "gold standard" coin as long as it isn't alt-forked into uselessness. All these fiat-bitcoins that copy the ledger remove value from bitcoin itself.
Altcoins have more value starting from 0 and offering features. I realize it is easier to copy-paste the existing bitcoin ledger and then create a bunch of fake news stories by spending alt-fork coin like crazy. That doesn't mean the cheating is a sound policy technically or economically long term.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:07:20
So how many bitcoins exist before and after? How many "bitcoin cash" exists after? I'm assuming that they *did* copy the ledger, right? They just printed a bunch of fiat from nothing.
If Bitcoin Cash is a great solution, that's awesome if they are an alt-coin. They should start a ledger from zero and people will make more money than a simple 2x copy. They could convince people on the strength of their technology to mine from block 0 and it would be awesome for everyone. The early adopters would make huge profits, much more than the simple 2x of a copied ledger.
The core problem, irrespective of technology, is that if we print another 18-21 mil fiat bitcoin every month and they are accepted on exchanges, then bitcoin has no value and neither does the alt-fork fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:27:22
Bitcoin shouldn't be the only coin. It should be the most stable. It shouldn't handle the transactions for the whole world, just the "gold standard" transactions. Altcoins have a role to fill, but they need to start from 0 and not duplicate all the bitcoins that exist. Allowing an alt-fork to be a viable coin is always bad, there is no upside. Creating Altcoins from 0 allows more innovation without the baggage of backwards compatibility with the existing bitcoin blockchain. Alt-fork is fiat-coin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:34:52
Yes, alt-forks create too much fiat bitcoin. Getting paid for a fake news PR campaign after copying the bitcoin ledger is paying too well, the cheating is high and the punishment is null at the moment. A 51% mining pool attack against the fiat wallet of any exchange that trades an alt fork is appropriate.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:37:57
Agreed, and altcoins starting from zero would be better than altforks creating fiat bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:28:48
Double spending by inventing fiat bitcoin by copying and marketing the blockchain is an attack, yes or no?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:33:18
Yeah. A 51% attack that drains the wallet of any exchange that accepts an alt-fork would be viable. Creating bitcoin fiat with a copy paste and a PR campaign should be punished, not rewarded. Dump all those alt-fork coins on any exchange that sells them, then drain the wallet. Make money two or 3 times over. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:47:24
So you have bitcoins, and you have BCH, and how many other bitcoin forks of the blockchain have there been? How many can you spend or exchange? They don't necessarily reach equivalent value, but your wallet got cloned.
I'm an alt-coin developer, but I'm going to start from 0 and not by copying an existing blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:49:17
I have no bitcoin, no bch, and no skin in the game. I am pro alt-coin and anti alt-fork. When the ledger gets copied, the whales benefit most and 18 mil new coins are printed fiat into existence. When they trade at 1/10th value, that's still 1.8 million instant coins. Unless alt-forking is dealt with seriously by the community I will perform an exercise of 18 million new bitcoins every week. Would be nice if I could afford some bitcoins first. I also recommend targeting every exchange that has alt-forks. What I'm thinking about doing in the near term is releasing BC0, a bitcoin cash that starts off from 0 ledger. If the technology is truly superior, then the coin will survive. Early adopters will make a lot more than a simple 10 or 20% (or a 2x copy) as ICO's clearly show.
The death of bitcoin is 18-21 mil new coins printed every month or week from fiat, somehow given value by the marketplace. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:27:30
if you replace the word "consensus" with "marketing campaign" then I agree - it does have enough. But it should start from 0 and not duplicate the bitcoin chain. Is their project not strong enough on its own merit to start from 0? You'd make a lot more money mining from 0 than double-spending fiat coin.
ICO are a good example of how quickly a coin can grow in value.
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:30:24
"for free" has a huge assumption. It assumes that you spent it on inflationary items and then recoup the money through wage inflation aka raises? It is expressed in a false way but I think what you meant was "the cost of acquiring capital was free."

Federal reserve has a bunch of chairs that vote and one that announces the results. The chairs that vote are held by private bankers intending to earn profit. The chair that announces the results is appointed by the government to give the illusion of government influence in the votes of private bankers.

Monero uses discrete logs for privacy. Cloud based (like IBM) quantum computers will crack that privacy layer (and bitcoin, ethereum, etc) in 1-3 years. With a 7 year statute of limitations, there is plenty of time to get arrested for use of privacy.
