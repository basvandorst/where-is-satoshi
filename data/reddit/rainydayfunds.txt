I used gyft. got two out of three cards successfully.
Customer support is being helpful so far.  They're supposedly going to credit me or refund me for the card that gyft.com didn't recognize as a sale.  I don't know if directly to my wallet or just gift me a gift card of the same value.
Still waiting on them to answer and verify with the block chain that the transactions actually happened.

By the way, does anyone know if there is a BTC machine in NY??

That's two people involved in BTC dead in the last week or two.
Something is fishy.

I'm waiting on a response from gyft also. 
Apparently while I was buying a Chilis gift card, I guess the window from gyft.com didn't recongnize the sale.
Blockchain did and had been confirmed.
Sucky part is there is no way as far as I know to let the address I sent it to know I didn't get a gyft card.
I wonder what they're going to be able to do for me.
I sent them the hashtag so they can see the transactions address, which I'm hoping is the same one every time somebody buys that particular gift card.

There should be a notice or announcement on the front page of the website.
This explains why they have not got back to me in regards to a refund.
They're going to be making a killing, it's a genius idea what they have created.

Yes, no pincode or barcode.
I'll let you all know after they eat how it went.
I also told them to let everyone there know that they're eating 
because of bitcoin.
