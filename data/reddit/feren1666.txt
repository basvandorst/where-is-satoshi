They should have excluded addresses belonging to exchanges, since most people are insane and leave their crypto in exchanges for years and years (but trade them from time to time, so the coins changed hands even though no blockchain record is generated).

Issue 5 is just shit statists say to pretend its ok.

Argentinian here. I think the greatest pain is the local regulations (up until recently only traditional banks were allowed to have ATMs of any kind) and costs. The other day I found a bi-directional bitcoin ATM at a major shopping center here in Buenos Aires, but the price is expensive (almost +10% USD a week ago, I checked today the price is +5%, which is a lot more reasonable). The thing that sucks is having to register with your national ID document and the ATM even takes a photo of your face along with telephone number (guess the KYC is imposed by regulations).

Someone has a good estimate of how big would blocks be in terms of MB if instead of normal transactions we had Bulletproof Ring Confidential Transactions (like monero)? how open would you be to increasing the block size NOT to scale, but to allow for Bulletproof Ring Confidential Transactions?

Right, that's becase there's a 99% chance you are a privileged 1st world citizen. Its way easier to see the damage socialism does when you live on countries that have been living under it for a long time and where the state plays a huge role. Come have a holiday in Argentina, enjoy having to surrender about 75% of you income to a government that gives you back almost nothing in exchange, most of the time feels a lot like a mafia. 
A government that has destroyed more than 5 monetary signs in less than 50 years. That has systematically stolen the life savings of your greatgrandparents, grandparents, parents and most likely in the future mine too. That routinely causes hundreds of young children die of hunger in the strets because of bad economic policy.
A government that has over-regulated the entire economy to the point that people consider that you don't hire employees, you adopt them for life because of almost communist-like labor laws. A country that has incurred in fiscal deficits for almost 70 years straight, and collapsed several times because of it.
I could go on for hours. Think this is exclusive to Argentina? think again. The only poser here is you buddy.

Bisq for crypto-to-crypto is awesome, needs some liquidity but now that shapeshift was captured by the KYC/AML monster then I guess it should be getting more liquidity soon. Lets support this decentralized exchange :) has a long history of well desgined, privacy-focused development and is super legit. For monero/btc exchanges there's good liquidity even.

While I agree that a wallet for normies should not include any bitcoin/lightning related terminology/concepts like channels, better wallets for regular bitcoin users should be welcomed. I don't think lightning is ready yet for a normal user to interact with it without having to understand it's basic concepts.

What a priviliged first-world prick, I sincerely hope you never have to experience socialism, as someone who has and whose family had for two generations I wouldn't wish that even on my worst enemy.

While I agree with your general idea the tricky part is that if a company builds a custodial wallet they'll have to comply with heavy regulation eventually, so the user experience would not differ much from just using your normal bank account, save for being able to send tips online and some other minor features that, while interesting, will not drive mass adoption.

The cost of healthcare in US is not related to a failure of capitalism, it's related to how badly over regulated the whole sector is. Same for rent (building permits, urban planning), student loans, etc.
Long term the worker always loses in socialism. The rich have the means to escape the country when shit hits the fan. And when I say lose I mean you-may-end-in-a-mass-unidentified-grave kind of loss.

I hear you man, in the shit country I live for every 100$ you get the employers actually payed 165$, those $65 are taken by the government/syndicate. 
Then when you go and spend the $100 that you did receive, 50% of that goes to taxes (55% if you buy a new car).
So you generated $165 in value, but only get to consume goods and services for $50.
Socialism is cancer.

Thanks, that was informative :)

If applied there would be 2 kind of nodes then? one with the full blockchain history and another that does not keep the whole blockchain (only the zk proof) but that can verify if a new transaction is valid/double spent or not?
