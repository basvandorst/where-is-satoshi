Hey thanks :D I appreciate the tip! 
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:11:42
Er... I am now invested in Bitcoin. That makes this an investment. 
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:25:41
Thanks for the donations, guys. I appreciate it!

I agree to an extent (that's why I got in!), but I feel pretty confident that the bottom was tested a couple of weeks ago and it's not going to be quite as crazy as the spike and crash at the end of 2013. 
We'll see if I eat my words, though. This is money I can afford to lose. No hard feelings one way or the other. :)

Coinbase. It went up $12 from when I went out to grab dinner and a beer to think about it, but meh. If I don't end up holding this long enough for capital gains to ~~expire~~ decrease after 12 months I'll be a bit surprised.

Oh awesome, thanks for this. I did not know! 
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:38:00
Haha. I've done it before. I got in at $380 with $8.5k and out at $650 last time. This is a smaller investment and I don't expect it to be quite as spikey, but the timing felt right.

Thanks. Sorry, my phrasing was poor. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:27:11
You think so? Why?
@_date: 2015-01-26 06:09:07
Yep :p 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:29:05
Purchased it through Coinbase...

All of my passwords are random 256-bit phrases generated via KeePass when it comes to financial stuff. :) As long as someone isn't getting a keylogger on my PC it should be alright!

:D Thanks! I just managed the [ top post of all time]( on r/music last week. 
It was really nice to see how many people still consider Bitcoin a viable donation platform. I'd prefer not to have PayPal track all of the donations if at all possible. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:55:44
Why? 
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:52:02
I'm actually fairly certain I went through with that procedure. Odd, maybe the CC expired or something. I don't see any notifications or reminders of "steps to complete" on my account, though, and I've had it for 1.5 years or so?

verb (used with object)
to put (money) to use, by purchase or expenditure, in something offering potential profitable returns, as interest, income, or appreciation in value.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:52:52
For sure! I'm not doing this to try and make a bunch of money or because I think it's a reliable source of income. This is essentially gambling albeit there's not a house stacking odds. 
All of my stocks are incredibly boring DRIP-inspired purchases and blue chips/indexes.
I just wanted something fun to check in on the morning alongside my e-mail for a while. Heartbreak or not. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:39:07
Oh, I do! I take tips on [my website]( supported Dogecoin for a while in the hype, and am well aware of changetip. :) 
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:51:20
Yeah, that's basically why I am interested. Market cap is still pretty low. Do you know if there are services which allow me to buy bitcoin over a stretch period of time? Like, "I would like to purchase $1k in bitcoin over 30 days" ?
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:47:01
Only looking for opinions. :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:51:32
That's why I am here, yo! To learn! :)

Cool. Coinbase is who I am with. I really enjoyed their user interface and ease-of-access. I'll look into that feature. It sounds like about what I want -- something to ride out the waves and 'forget about it,' but still get into Bitcoin. Thanks!
