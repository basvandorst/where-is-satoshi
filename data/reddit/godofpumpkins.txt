And almost nobody can run an ethereum full node now. All the node software out there doesn’t do full verification by default, and even in that state it’s pretty hit or miss to bootstrap a new “full” node. I tried firing up a fresh one on a pretty powerful machine of mine (with 75mbit symmetric internet, good CPU, and fast SSD) last month and geth repeatedly stalled and refused to sync. After about two weeks trying different stuff, I gave up. The issue trackers and forums are full of reports like that, so it’s not just me.
Ethereum is lots of things and there’s a lot of interesting development going on with it, but it’s clear to me at least that the developers have kind of given up on decentralization. Which obviously makes scaling easier, because you can start to resemble traditional distributed systems with the associated trust sacrifices and scale gains.

There is a fairly friendly lightning GUI but it only runs on testnet and I’ve found a few bugs in it with some minor usage. Having said that, people trying it is how you find bugs.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:07:49
The fees and the rates you’re comparing to are relative to different amounts though: you’re giving a reasonable argument for rates of return relative to tied up capital being at least as good as money market rates (although I think it might be different, more below) but fees on transactions are relative to what is transacted, which has no strong linkage to capital tied up. That is, I might tie up $1M worth of BTC and expect maybe 1% return on it, but in practice depending on flow through my channels being reasonably balanced, that $1M of BTC could be millions of transactions.
Also, I’m not sure that money market rates are the right comparison here. LN nodes seem very appealing to long-term BTC hodlers who want to be long BTC but also earn some income on it. There aren’t many options out there for low-risk income-generating investments out there that are still long BTC, so I’d bet the capital tie-up rates people are willing to accept will end up being lower than money market rates. Hodlers today are getting 0% and the main downside to tying up a majority of their capital in LN is the risk associated with moving from cold storage to warm storage. So I expect rates will be pretty low for a while, unless I’m missing something big.

Asking for dates of ATHs seems kinda iffy from a testing perspective. I’ve been around for all of them but could only answer a couple with certainty because they coincided with other memorable events.

I think you can also just opt out of routing (I think `lnd` calls it autopilot where it will auto-open channels for you as needed) instead of setting unreasonably high fees.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:35:09
In theory it’s a tad more trustable too, but the difference is negligible unless you’re hyper paranoid or powerful people are actually out to get you
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:53:49
Because block rewards were intended to bootstrap the system and decrease geometrically to ensure a fixed supply, and without a block limit you don’t get fees. The only way to keep mining profitable in the long run, then, is:
1. keep increasing block size when it fills up, this ensuring you get no fees and miners rely entirely on the ever-shrinking block reward. For mining to stay profitable, this means that price _must_ increase exponentially to counteract the decreasing block reward, or network security will suffer
2. don’t adjust block size, which in the long run means fees become the only source of income for miners, and is basically a pure market (although it’s kind of weird as a market because it resembles an auction and has awkward signaling)
3. try to use judgment to adjust block size to retain some subjectively optimal fee/block reward breakdown. Question then becomes whose judgment and what are they optimizing for. Also hard to say if people would rally against the person or people making this judgment as hard as they rally against the fed making similar broad economy choices
Bitcoin is far has chosen  and it seems like bcash is planning to go with  or possibly  if they run into capacity problems. Most core devs have agreed that a block size increase (like  will eventually be required but will need far more consensus behind it than bcash or the planned b2x version got.
tl;dr: limits create scarcity, which creates markets
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:17:32
The point that funds are never “locked away”: transactions don’t happen on the main chain but can be reconciled with it at any time (with a slight time delay) so if you get annoyed at your counterparty, you just close out your channel and find another one. Because it’s fundamentally so easy to compete, there’s not actually much incentive for inner nodes to mess with you.
That’s why this is cool and is a nontrivial amount of effort. If all we had were the equivalent of mtgox coupons (an old way to exchange money when mtgox was still around) we’d be far less interested. Instead this actually has sensible cryptography behind it that makes it an effectively trustless (modulo wasted time) system.
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:38:42
To be more specific:
- ring signatures give uncertainty (user-selectable) about which outputs are your inputs
- confidential transaction values (derived from gmaxwell’s proposal from years ago) use clever crypto to hide amounts being transacted
- addresses are split so seeing values go into them doesn’t help you find values coming out of them
- lots of efforts to homogenize transactions to minimize fingerprintability
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:08:50
Amounts are completely invisible to anyone but the people involved in the transaction now thanks for CT, which uses clever crypto to ensure that the network can verify that the input and output values add up properly (and are nonnegative) without being able to see what they are. I wasn’t around in monero pre-CT so I don’t know what it did back then, but what you’re saying sounds plausible based on the ring signature inputs Monero borrowed from cryptonote

Geographic distribution affects correlation of risk: dictatorships, earthquakes, blackouts, undersea cables are all things affected by geography that won’t make the network very happy if enough nodes are affected.

Oh, I meant intermediate nodes. Yes, availability is definitely more valuable the closer you are in the graph to someone
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:17:42
Sender always pays fees, so it doesn’t really matter where you send it. If you’re not in a rush, just pick a low fee and it’ll get confirmed eventually. Even during the super high congestion period, I sent a txn with a laughably low fee and it confirmed in 12 days, which was fine by me because I was in no rush to get it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:58:05
Monero has obfuscated transaction amounts for a long time now. See RingCT (or just my sibling comment to yours) for more info.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:28:00
Well, monero protects more than just transaction amounts. If coinjoin + CT becomes mainstream/feasible/default perhaps, but in the absence of mandatory confidentiality, even just hiding amounts when most people don’t looks shady.
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:31:46
People keep citing that number but nobody I know who’s tried bootstrapping a new one recently has succeeded. So it might be true for now, but it’s not going to grow much further if they don’t fix it.

The only way not to get geometrically decreasing reward is to have geometrically increasing price of the token in question. We can cross our fingers that bitcoin’s price doubles every four years but that seems rather optimistic.

@_date: 2018-01-02 02:21:20
Well, it remains to be seen if the availability is valuable to users or if  the routing is such that if you go down, users just move to a different node. In that sense, your availability is beneficial mostly to yourself. As middlemen, I imagine most lightning nodes will be pretty interchangeable from a user perspective unless people are paying large amounts (which will need nodes with more committed funds available, reducing available funds for other txns, etc.)
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:40:46
It hasn’t though. If you go through my recent comments you’ll see my account of the woes of trying to stand up a full ethereum node and how I eventually gave up. Go to the forums or the issue trackers and you’ll find tons more accounts like mine. I have a beefy machine, a fast internet connect, tons of system knowledge and after several weeks was still unable to stand up a full eth node. What’s everyone else going to do?
That’s not even considering that full ethereum nodes aren’t even fully verifying anymore by default.
Anyway, ethereum is doing lots of interesting things, but scaling at the expense of decentralization is easy; you see bcash trying it and hell, their fees can be lower. The point here isn’t so much to focus on the constant factors but to change the asymptotics of the system. In the short term Bitcoin sucks at this sort of thing, but short of mimblewimble becoming mainstream, I don’t know of other plausible long-term solutions to scaling that aren’t layer 2.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:07:39
The latter one is completely unrelated, and is intended for the accounting tool
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:55:55
Sure, but then you can replace by fee or layer another transaction on top of it. The money is either yours or it's your counterparty's. The limbo might be disheartening (especially in some clients) but it can't get lost along the way.

That opportunity cost though... options (in the financial instrument sense as well as a less formal one) still have concrete value
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:03:06
No, because the channel relies on both parties agreeing to the new balance, and only you have your private keys, so they can’t unilaterally take your money. If the coffee shop tried to claim your money without your cooperation, you’d go back to the main blockchain (think of it like going to court over a contract dispute) and you’d get your money.

How? I’ve tried repeatedly to bootstrap a fresh ethereum full node over the past several weeks on beefy hardware and a fat internet connection and have failed repeatedly on geth. Judging by forums and issue tracker this is blocking many people, with some people going so far as to say that it’s impossible to bootstrap new nodes anymore. Parity works a bit better but is still pretty brutal. I also hear that even if you get a full node spun up, it’s hard to keep it synced up. What are people doing to keep them running?

@_date: 2017-12-26 18:08:39
Isn’t that a bit like saying that BCH fees are lower so it’s better than BTC? Regardless of relative merit (which I can’t speak to because I don’t have a Trezor), Trezor is clearly doing less business than Ledger so I’d expect the latter to be struggling harder with support requests. They’ll scale up to the new demand but like bitcoin, it doesn’t happen overnight.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:36:59
Isn’t the point is that you don’t? The analogy I’ve seen is that you have a contract with your nodes, and the main chain is a court that can enforce the contract. If everyone’s honest, you don’t go to court, but you can go to court and get your money if your counterparty tries to screw you.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:44:47
In some sense, I’d say so. The block reward was intended as a bootstrapping measure, and it intentionally decreases over time. The plan wasn’t for price to never stop increasing to counteract the diminishing reward; it was for a fee market to make up the difference, so in many ways having nontrivial fees is actually the system going as planned. It might have started doing this at a smaller scale than we’d hoped, but the block reward is going away someday on BCH and BTC and all the other coins, and fees are intended as the actual long-term mechanism to incentivize miners...
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:08:06
Not if someone did atomic swaps between the two. The proposed design for that is obviously private on the monero side and looks like buying a preimage of a hash on the bitcoin side which is a legitimate construction in several different transaction types.

You speak dismissively of politics when it fairly accurately summarizes one’s views and attitudes on a wide range of topics.

@_date: 2018-09-16 18:20:58
You’re not factoring in benefit and size: for example, gold is far more widespread than bitcoin yet only a little larger in energy consumption. Banking is a lot larger but does a ton of shit that bitcoin has nothing to do with: serves literally billions of people, handles M&amp;A, loans &amp; mortgages, miscellaneous services.
I’m not saying that bitcoin’s energy consumption is a deal-breaker, but it doesn’t make me happy either, and holding these stats up in isolation and treating them as a good thing just makes us look like we have tunnel vision.

Its a hell of a lot more than a modified usb stick though. The similarity in appearance is about as far as that goes... have you looked at yubikeys? That’s the sort of device I’d think to compare it to, if anything 
@_date: 2018-09-07 02:26:31
It’s not a max, it’s an average. If the network is overpowered vs. the current difficulty, you’ll get more blocks per day, but the network self-adjusts difficulty to aim for 10-minute blocks. In practice, sometimes you’ll get blocks just seconds apart and sometimes you’ll see hours without a block. It’s sort of a Poisson process in an idealized setting.
Edit: on your question about working to solve more than one block at a time, the answer is sort of yes and no: in one sense, they’re working to solve bajillions of blocks at a time; that’s what mining is, trying random hash perturbations until you find something that fits the difficulty criterion, so yes they’re solving lots of blocks at a time. In another sense, they’re generally only testing one block template at a time: they generally have some rules about which transactions they want to include in a block (based on fees and other notions of priority) and there’s not much point in varying that. A miner has finite hash power and given how hash functions work, you might as well perturb your ideal set of transactions, because it won’t affect how much work you’ll have to put in.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:36:29
So that’s a no? There are plenty of “intuitive” arguments going the other way too; the point of people wanting to try the experiment is to see what actually happens, since we can all argue till the cows come home about “human nature” and “game theory” but it’s all worthless compared to actual data.

Yes, I use it all the time on two different Macs, with custom fees. It’s smooth and good.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:48:28
Not really. Many of the core developers have said that a block size increase is inevitable. The disagreement wasn't fundamentally about increasing it, it was whether to rush it out with bad testing and minimal consensus. The core side mostly maintained that it was irresponsible to rush it out on the proposed bcash/segwit2x timeline.
Edit: of course, the nuance was probably lost on the mainstream public, so when someday core does increase block size, I'm sure there will be plenty of "told you so"-style comments

The analogy was more about paying others for peace of mind. For more detail on my actual stance, see [this other comment of mine](
As for your “knowing the key” bit, assuming you never write it down, the estate planning stuff still applies, as does insurance against memory loss. We’re mostly young and healthy, but all it takes is a concussion to start getting hazy about stuff like this, and I’d rather not trust my retirement/children’s inheritance to the quality of my memory, which is notorious for deteriorating with age.
As far as trust in their systems, it’s mostly about their legal footprint and means as an organization. Say they lose a few billion in bitcoin. It sucks but it’s a tiny percentage of their means as an organization and as a legal entity they’re likely to cough up the missing coin given enough time.
Ultimately yes, you’re right though: under normal circumstances I do trust myself to keep things secure, but also realize that a lot of stuff is outside my control and want to be prepared for that too.

Research doesn’t work that way, and would be completely impractical if it did. Can you imagine trying to read a physics paper that just wrote a bunch of stuff, with a note at the end from the authors saying “if anything seems off to you let me know and I’ll explain”.
No, claims are cited throughout papers, so that if anything seems off as someone is reading it, they can follow the particular citation for that particular claim and look at the body of work that went into it, to see first if it matches your summary of it, and second if there were any flaws in that research. It also helps the authors because after writing many dense pages on a topic it’s not as if they remember that “oh that claim about the energy of a Higgs Boson came from Smith et al. 2015 but Nakamoto 2016 took issue with their findings and used a more conservative approach to find a value of X”. So people cite inline :)

You have no idea what it was like back then. Coins were very hard to buy and apart from random enthusiasts selling alpaca socks and candy for them, nobody used them. When it hit $1 everyone thought it was a crazy bubble and way overvalued for a random tech experiment. The “we’re gonna take down the world financial system” folks were far rarer and less outspoken and there were far more technical people who spoke more about that.
For some perspective, luke-jr and I used to joke on IRC that we’d sell all our coins when they hit $25 apiece, because it seemed like such a batshit insane number that it seemed like a reasonable way to say “I’m not selling”. I’d be willing to bet that 99% of very early adopters sold most of their coins when it hit $1, or on the rundown from the $31 ATH, or possibly around $100 if they held on hard.
Very easy to look back and say “well obviously just hold on and you’ll be rich” but when you have bills to pay and $10k is a healthy sum that would make life a lot easier, and you’re already very far ahead, most people would probably sell a substantial number.
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:32:26
Yeah, and they're trying to give OP some perspective. We're 20x the price we were at last year (which itself was considered a "joke" unattainable price after the first big crash), the biggest exchange in bitcoin history just died taking many people's savings with it, and the price has inched down by a few percent.

Let me try a different approach:
HOW do you DEAL with THE possibility of someone breaking into your house AND hitting you WITH a wrench UNTIL you reveal however you store your private KEYS? Or hitting your LOVED ones? Or HOW do you plan for your estate? If you die PREMATURELY, how do you ensure your coins MAKE it to your family/beneficiaries? Are you well protected/insured against NATURAL disasters or theft?
Keep in mind Lopp’s recent tests on the metallic private key storage and the fact that most of them failed, and do nothing against theft or “dishonest maids”.
The concerns I list above aren’t new, and still apply to bitcoin as much as they apply to traditional assets. Economies of scale/scope also work in this space and can in many situations make it beneficial to pay someone else to think about for you. I don’t keep my fiat cash under my mattress for a reason, and it’s not because BANK$TERS are holding me down.

Sure, but many of the datastructure's security properties come from the massive amount of mining behind it. The more miners are on it, the costlier it is to attack it, and the more secure your application becomes. Just creating a detached new blockchain for another project won't buy you security until you gain fairly high adoption, which is unlikely to happen without a concrete reward structure incentivizing mining.

The invisible other branch might make selecting you as a rubber hose target in the first place less appealing, but assuming you've been selected (because you drive a Lambo with a BITCOIN license plate, perhaps), you'd have a hard time claiming you don't know what the other branch of the MAST conditional expands to.

That sounds like a huge risk for the exchange. What if I simultaneously made a network transaction with the private key and an exchange trade with its contents? An hour later the exchange would be out coins and my account would have fiat in it. They could penalize me for doing that, but fixing it would require either rolling back trades (ugh) or the exchange acting as some degree of counterparty in the transaction, neither of which are desirable. The unpredictable nature of transaction relaying also means that there isn't a guarantee that their attempt to spend from your private key would post instead of yours. Or exchange transactions could slow down and wait for confirmations, so your order to sell 50 coins on gox would take an hour or more. Limit transactions would further complicate that scheme!

No, the bank payments stopped for regulatory paranoia reasons and the well known practice of banks making MtGox's (and thus our) life very difficult. The btc withdrawal bug has been present (and observed) for ages, long before any of this crap started. The problems really started getting bad when people realized they weren't going to get fiat anytime soon, so they said "I'll take a loss, buy some coin" (driving up the price on MtGox) and try to withdraw the btc. All of a sudden, MtGox has way more btc withdrawals than before, all with some chance (possibly non-linearly growing) of triggering their shitty withdrawal bug.

If you’d bought coin 10 years ago you’d probably have sold most of it when it hit $1 (everyone freaked out and thought that was a crazy bubble) and the rest of it when it hit $31 and then started crashing and fell down to $2 again. Nobody knew to expect giant swings and most people were still getting used to it being worth anything at all. A lot of the really early adopters lost coin because it wasn’t worth anything and they accidentally formatted their hard drive or lost the wallet or whatever
In short, almost nobody who bought back then still has any substantial amount of coin.

This is why I hate percentages: if hash rate drops by 90%, you're left with 1/10 of rate you started with, so other things being equal, blocks will take 10x longer (or a 900% increase) to find until difficulty adjusts. Since it can only adjust by 4x at a time it would take two periods to get back on track.

I got into it in 2011 and bought quite a few coins in the $teens after the $31 peak. Started freaking out watching it go down to $2. For the longest time we joked about "I'll sell you all my coins when they hit $25" as if it was an unattainable high we'd never hit again. When we eventually hit $25 again, many people I knew sold most of their coins.
Times were scary back then and it was much less mainstream, with a lot less support from reputable companies (it was really hard to even buy coin! I was doing most of this over IRC) and you're fooling yourself if you tell yourself you'd have had the level of hodl conviction you have today after seeing all the janky exchanges implode one after another, massive manipulation (markets were super shallow even on mtgox) and all the other shit going on. Most people from that time probably cashed out on the rise to $100, and the unlucky ones sold at a loss during one of the many giant crashes.

You'll find a spread on almost any financial provider offering transfers across currencies today. Have you tried asking your bank to transfer money internationally? They'll often charge a fixed fee and then quote you an exchange rate. Compare that rate with the value you find on the internet and it will always be in the bank's favor, often by quite a bit.
The rates you find on a ticker are always just showing you what the last transaction completed at; there's no such thing as a true price, just bids and asks that get matched. The area of the order book around the last transaction price is generally fairly shallow so entities known as market makers hang out in that space offering to buy and sell reasonable amounts for a little bit above and below last prices under the assumption that prices oscillate and that they'll make money in the spread between the two. Most folks buying and selling currency don't want to have to think about slippage and various other consequences of order book mechanics, and so are willing to deal with middlemen who take a fixed percentage fee and give them predictable trades. Coinbase is one of those.
You or I might prefer to deal directly on the exchange but most people just want to buy bitcoin just like they buy any other currency, and Coinbase is providing that service with a similar profit model to the rest of that industry.

XMR is much harder to atomic swap with or even do lightning with because it has no “script” and thus we can’t construct HTLCs on it.

And that’s just for a vanilla atomic swap; getting anything LN-like, if even possible, would take a lot more work.

Making sense to normal people is great, but if someone does what you’re saying with 12 words, that means I need to search 48 bits to find the rest of your key, which is quite feasible even for an attacker of moderate means, which means as user-friendly as your proposal is, someone still stole their money.

Farmers are pretty much the canonical futures example. You can find hundreds of tutorials and intro videos that talk about how they work, that’s probably better than anything any of us could write here.
That said, I’ll try: the idea is that you’re a miner, just bought an ASIC, expect to produce at a certain rate given difficulty changes, etc. You also need to pay the power bills in dollars and don’t want to worry too hard about exchange rates and just want to earn some predictable money from it. You find Joe, a graffiti artist who needs to draw on satoshis.place every day and thus needs a steady influx of BTC at a predictable price. You and Joe talk for a bit and realize you want similar things. You strike a deal that if he gives you $X today, you’ll give him Y BTC when you mine it (this is a simplification and in practice these are used to “lock in a price” rather than pay today, get goods later, but you get the idea). You now have your predictable $ and he knows he’ll have BTC when he needs it.
Now expand this scenario to more than two random people making a deal and you end up with an exchange, with people offering different amounts of money or $ to buy or sell their future risk. And of course, the market is full of speculators who have no interest in the underlying goods and actively don’t want them delivered. Lots of funny stories about futures traders who fuck up and accidentally end up with a few truckloads of wheat or oil on their doorstep and have nowhere to put it.
In practice with farming it’s more common for folks to need raw materials so my Joe example was a bit contrived, and more likely he’s probably a speculator betting that the future price of BTC will be higher than what he paid for it.

There’s no single OTC market, that’s why it’s OTC. Simplest entry point to some tiny subset of it is  on freenode, but remember that there’s a reason most people don’t trade OTC: apart from it being hard to find counterparties, all of a sudden you have counterparty risk again. There are a few quiet fat cats hanging out on IRC but there are also a ton of scammers waiting to take advantage of noobs who don’t realize all the ways they can be taken advantage of in this market. Chargebacks everywhere, simply disappearing before sending money, concocting silly stories and convoluted verification procedures to con you, and lots more.
Unless you have big requirements that exceed what a public exchange can give you, I’d recommend not going OTC unless you do a ton of reading first and familiarize yourself with the ratings system, find trusted escrows, realize that chargebacks can be applied weeks or even months after the fact, and so on.

I don’t think that would be even theoretically possible. Think about it: a lender/borrower situation means the lender relinquishes access to liquidity and gives that liquidity to the borrower. The borrower needs to use that money so it needs to actually be liquid. Apply a hypothetical “your coins will be recalled in a year” mechanism to that money now: the borrower’s borrowed coins are now far less liquid because all his counterparties need to be aware that the coins will be recalled at some point, so they become less valuable.
The difficulty is that the borrower is taking on some risk being on the hook for money they might not be able to pay back. The only way a coin could guarantee that the coins get returned is by marking the coins (and thus moving the risk from the borrower to their counterparties) or by putting up some form of illiquid collateral in an escrow of some sort, which I don’t think was what you meant?

Folks keep repeating “not your keys, not your bitcoins” but it’s ultimately advocating keeping cash under a mattress, with the same benefits and drawbacks. There’s a reason most of us don’t keep our wealth at home, under a mattress, and that’s because we fear fire, burglaries, kidnapping, and other badness suddenly killing our retirement in an instant.
There are slightly more responsible ways to keep large amounts of wealth at home, like a big fireproof safe, or a real safe and a decoy safe, or a bunch of other options depending on your threat model, but ultimately society mostly still derides folks who do that as unwise, because for the vast majority of common people who are not particularly smart or security-minded, attempting to guard your own wealth is more likely to lose it than trusting someone who has an economy of scale (e.g., a bank) to do it for you. Yes, there’s the occasional Cyprus event, but this feels similar to fears of plane crashes: when they happen, they’re all over the news and people freak out about flying. Then they hop into their two ton lump of steel and go hurtling off into a sea of other stupid people who are probably mildly intoxicated and texting, completely ignoring that it’s statistically far riskier to drive than to fly.
Anyway, I’m not really disagreeing with you either, but I think there’s a lot more nuance to it than the folks who parrot those words whenever something like this comes up. I don’t keep my cash under my mattress and I bet you don’t either. I take precautions with my coins, but the fact is that people could just as easily say “not your cash, not your money” but they don’t, and it’s often for good reason, because most of us aren’t equipped to deal with low-probability devastating events. You can encrypt it up the wazoo and split the keys across the earth like Horcruxes, but all it takes is a motivated attacker who kidnaps your kid or brother or dog or whatever you value more than money, and all that security is for nothing. Unlikely, sure, but that’s why we usually have someone else handle risks like that for us.

Yeah. Well the limits are lower ($1M IIRC) for companies, but I think their goal is to act as a regulated back-end/clearing house for bitcoin options, rather than something end-users would interact with directly.

Of course for that to work, we need user-focused companies using them... which I don’t think has happened much yet.

Furthermore, market cap is basically a bogus calculation on any good. Every asset out there has market depth and I can guarantee that if Bezos decided to liquidate all of his Amazon shares at once, he’d get far less than a simple shares * price calculation would suggest.
A big part of the misunderstanding is that everywhere reports assets (bitcoin, stock, etc. after their initial offering) as having “a price”, but really the price you see on all these exchanges is “last price”, which just means that the most recent transaction (for an unspecified amount of the asset) happened at that price. For all you know the market is super shallow, as it often is with penny stocks and altcoins, and that last price was a random fluke because someone fat-fingered an order and swapped price and quantity. Or the order book could be ridiculously deep, as it is on mainstream forex exchanges, and selling a billion dollars will move the price very little.
Furthermore, the static state of the order book often tells you comparatively little too (though still more than more simplistic measures) because often if prices start to move, folks move their existing orders out of the way (or occasionally into the way), so even if at this moment it would take $60M to reach $10k in a single giant order, in practice if we started rallying more slowly, you’d see the ask side of the book thin out as people start speculating about being able to get more money.
Anyway, the basic takeaway is that static notions of supply, total shares, or simplistic multiplications of price and quantity are horribly flawed and people should drop the term “market cap” from their vocabulary. What matters is the point-in-time state of the order book.

If supply changes in a predictable way, I don’t see why that would be true. I get that many participants aren’t rational agents and folks need to pay bills and such, but if we go for a theory that I have some opinion on pricing based on supply and my forecast of future supply, here I know with some small margin of error (some blocks are fast, others slow) how supply works for bitcoin. The fact that it’s not steady doesn’t really change that.
Say for example I created an annuity-like contract for you that paid out the same dollar amounts as bitcoin produced by mining over some period. So this hypothetical contract gives you $12.5 an hour today, and $6.25 after the next halving. Would you be able to price this contract accurately? Would you have much uncertainty around what you would pay for that contract? I wouldn’t, because it behaves just like an annuity and if you sum up the discounted expected payments you pretty much know what it’s worth to you. Yes, the contract will be worth less to you after the next block reward halving, but you know that today, and would pay me less for it today.
Curious to hear arguments to the contrary though!
@_date: 2018-06-20 01:08:39
Not really. Everyone knows about the supply change far in advance, so the theory at least is that it’s somewhat priced in.
Also, I get that the other replies in this thread don’t have the friendliest tone mocking you for drawing bad conclusions from extremely limited data, but folks see patterns in all sorts of shit and if this were as easy as “oh, supply increase cut in half, price obviously going up”, there would be far more rich people out there than there are. The fact is this stuff is true until it isn’t, and patterns are only obvious in retrospect. It could shoot up in 2021 for completely unrelated reasons or because your hypothesis is true, and we’ll never know. But it’s also kinda arrogant to say “only logical reply” to this when everyone else is saying it’s a bit of stretch for you to claim that it’s an obvious pattern. You basically came to the most facile conclusion possible: do you seriously think nobody’s thought of that before?
Truth is, unless you have enough money to tell a market where to go, you don’t know where it’s gonna go, and no amount of sophomoric Econ 101 “duh supply goes down so price goes up, simple” is going to give you an edge.

Yeah and plebs should only own one pair of pants and one shirt, but it’ll be made properly.
It’s easy to rally against this sort of thing but the single biggest improvement in global society’s standard of living is caused by this sort of thing. Stuff we take for granted today was the realm of the obscenely rich less than a century ago. Fresh fruit, widespread meat, entertainment, and information. Yes, we got a lot of waste out of it too, but I have trouble condemning the ability for a poor family in the US to buy several pairs of socks at Walmart for $5. Those socks were probably made in Cambodia and shipped halfway across the world and still cost less than the hourly wage of the poorest people in the US, and I consider that an amazing thing. There’s a lot wrong with today’s system and I’d love to improve it and reduce rampant consumerism, but I don’t know how to do it, and if I were given the choice between the world where we only had “quality” products and what we have now, I’d pick this without hesitation.
@_date: 2019-04-24 05:07:46
Assume for a moment that they are lying and don’t hold any BTC: now all of us go and buy a bunch on their platform, and they get our $$$$. Next, BTC moons to $20k again, and we all want to sell to cash out our gains. TD Ameritrade now has to pony up a bunch of cash and take a big loss.
So basically, an organization like this lying about holding the underlying asset while allowing folks to buy/trade it is effectively speculation on that asset by that organization. Big profitable companies like TDA don’t really enjoy speculating on highly volatile assets and would rather just take fees from other folks speculating on them, so it seems unlikely that they’d do that.
Now, if they allowed folks to short bitcoin as well, then they could in theory not be speculating on that asset and playing the role of a bookie, attempting to pair up longs and shorts. Unfortunately that behavior is called a bucket shop and is illegal, so it also seems unlikely that they’d engage in that.
They could craft some sort of derivative contracts on bitcoin price movements, but they don’t appear to be doing that or they’d say so, because those don’t behave the same way.
So what’s the concern here?

Yes and if I'm designing a MMO game and accidentally put a bug in it that gives one character class unreasonable power over everyone else, which then causes other players to all quit because it stops being enjoyable (useful) to them, and then the overpower class quits too because there's nobody else left, I generally try to fix the game to keep the game viable. 
And TBC: I'm not saying I want a system where miners are altruistic. I'm saying the system was designed so that they didn't need to be and the whole thing wouldn't collapse in spite of that. We found a bug where we need to rely a bit more on their altruism for the system not to collapse, and I'm saying it needs to be fixed so that we don't need to rely on their altruism anymore. That is, we need to align their incentives with those of the overall network again:
@_date: 2017-04-06 15:50:54
Yes but the point is the intent behind the rules. The distributed system is viable because we thought it correctly implemented the incentive structure that makes the entire system work properly. I'm not denying that the system currently allows and incentivizes the empty block behavior, but it's basically a design bug that if everyone took advantage of it would sink the system. Given the 30% benefit of an empty block probably exceeds reasonable fees that would counteract it, it is basically individually rational for all miners to start doing this, but if they all do it, Bitcoin stops working. That's why I'd call it a design bug, and Bitcoin is nothing if not a clever protocol that aligns incentives for disparate self-interested parties to achieve a globally useful system. If there's a bug in those incentives that leads to the system deteriorating, that bug should be fixed.

Mining empty blocks benefits nobody beyond the miners. If there's a protocol edge case that incentivizes empty blocks, that runs against the interests of Bitcoin as a whole, since the whole point of mining was to incentivize folks to do hard compute work for the benefit of the network. As such it feels a bit like an unintended bug that leads to undesirable incentives that overall reduce the health of the system.

17k alone wasn't enough to plunge the market, and all the cries blaming him on the forum are just from people who either don't understand how things work or who are irrational and annoyed having lost money in the crash. I know people who had larger short positions than he did and actually profited from the crash despite the big bounce.
Also, he isn't liable for all the money you say he is liable for. The reason people are terrified of margin calls is that your lender will force you to buy back (or sell if you're long) when the price seems to be going too high (or low if you're long) in an effort to not have to deal with risk of default. So if he had $13k in his account, he probably lost most or all of it on its way back up.

If all they do with their 51% is not include transactions, I don't see what the problem is.

It really just needs a consistently balanced tree with some abstract notion of accumulation up. Typically people like associative operators for accumulation, because they don't want the accumulator to be aware of the structure of the tree, but in this case you explicitly want a non-associative operator because you do want to represent the structure of the tree in your accumulator.
In a language with sufficient powers of abstraction, I'd talk about an abstract tree type parametrized by its accumulator, and then I could deal with the balancing implementation independently of the accumulation.

Legal tender laws only state that you must accept repayment of debt in the specified currency (not that debt must be repaid in that currency, just that if offered, you must accept it).

Lots of good points. The actual addresses / transaction IDs are meaningless to anyone who wants to visualize this stuff, so the bubble could be a lot smaller.
Another aesthetic suggestion might be to make the bubble be very slightly transparent. It'd make it less jarring as an overlay to the map, but if you're tasteful about the alpha you choose, it wouldn't make the bubble illegible.

What's amusing is that he's actually right (despite all the downvotes he's getting; *shock*), and it's a fun philosophical question to ask. No data has any meaning without an interpretation function for it, and interpretation functions can be arbitrarily complex. Granted, you couldn't pull it off as a legal excuse because we tend to favor a sort of Ockham's razor approach to decoders, but there is precedent for people talking about this aspect of data.
For a common example of the interpretation of data being important, say you have a 1MB block of random data (called A) and stored on your computer. Later, someone else takes a 1MB archive of CP (called B) and xors it against your random data. They discard their original CP and keep the xor result (called C). Someone else later takes an important archive of their diary (called D), also 1MB, and xors it against C (giving E), and discards the original.
Now we have:
* A is random data
* B is child porn, but has been deleted (but can be recovered by xoring C with A)
* C is random data derived from child porn
* D is important perfectly legal data owned by someone, but has been discarded (but can be recovered by xoring C with E)
* E is random data derived from child porn and perfectly legal data
So the illegal CP has been discarded but can be recovered if you have the right key. Furthermore, the data is in a sense split between two people, one of whom (A) has no clue what people have xored against his random block. Does A's lack of knowledge mean that C "is child porn"? Not really, because it too is a required key for recovering E's perfectly legal data.
Also worth considering (for the guy mentioning entropy and information theory) is that entropy isn't really what we're after here. The entropy of A-E will mostly be as high as it possibly can be, since B and D are compressed archives and compression's goal is to maximize entropy (in some sense) and A, C, and E are derived from high-entropy data and random data (also high entropy). If people voluntarily signed up to become nodes for a distributed filesystem that spread people's files around the network in this manner, everyone, in a sense, would be holding data derived from child porn, pirated material, and all sorts of other unsavory data. On the other hand, no single member could possibly be aware of what was stored on his computer, and furthermore, wouldn't even have the necessary components to decode it even if he chose to. Thus, if law enforcement decided to issue a DMCA takedown of the infringing data, what would they delete?
Anyway, the real question we're after in this discussion the uncomputable quantity called Kolmogorov Complexity, which abstractly measures the size of the smallest program that produces an answer. As someone else in the thread said, if you wanted to take one of my local text files and extract CP from it, you'd pretty much have to include the CP you're extracting in the decoding function. So in some sense, the real question here is relating `Kolmogorov(Input || Decoder)` to `Kolmogorov(Input)`, `Kolmogorov(Decoder)`, and `Kolmogorov(Output)`. If the algorithm produced as output something fundamentally unrelated to the input, the complexity of the output would be captured in the complexity of the decoder. Otherwise, the complexity of the output would be more closely related to the complexity of the input and the decoder. It's also worth bearing in mind that the distributed data xoring scheme I gave above (it isn't mine, but I can't remember where it's from) would make even this kind of interpretation difficult.
Anyway, I could go on for longer but I need to go to work now. I just wanted to jump in because I thought there were a lot of half-misunderstandings of CS being thrown around, and while hugolp's comment wouldn't be practically valid in most real-world cases, it's an interesting (if not entirely relevant to the question at hand) philosophical point to make, and I wish people wouldn't downvote him to hell for doing so.

Yeah, it's apparently a new policy to deal with excessive Dwolla withdrawals from certain users who had dozens of concurrent withdrawals to overcome limits.
Here are two approaches to that problem:
1.  Impose one-withdrawal-at-a-time limit, without warning anyone, and hope that the users who withdraw almost $100k a month over Dwolla magically disappear and stop needing to withdraw that much money.
2. Talk to said users, explain that it's expensive and hard for MtGox to keep wiring so much money to Dwolla, ask them to withdraw using other methods or charge them a fee for whatever expenses they contribute to.
It's clearly much more professional to just change existing behavior that you know everyone uses (that's why you're changing it) without warning anyone. Why communicate when you can break businesses using your service, instead?

Yeah, it seems like one of the easiest common definitions is "if you can exchange it for something of value, then it has value", but then that leads to issues of liquidity and marking to market: if I have an exotic OTC derivative that possibly gives me the option to sell my right to swap interest payments on an junk bond I won't own for another 6 months, intuitively that thing still has value, but I couldn't just pick up that contract and find a buyer if I wanted to sell it (and what would a good price be for it, if I have no buyers?).

Up until bitcoin came into being nobody knew how to even do that. The ensuing interest and research has led to interesting alternative models  but they all have different properties and trade-offs so far. Take monero for example, which uses an extension of gmaxwell’s proposal for confidential transaction to hide amounts, and ring signatures to give you some input confusion. Because all inputs are potentially live in this system, the live state a monero node needs to maintain only ever grows with time. Contrast to bitcoin which for maximum paranoia must keep the entire blockchain around, but only needs to track unspent outputs which can shrink over time (it can do that because it knows with certainty what’s spent and what isn’t). This in many ways is a legit scalability concern for monero, which could get awkward if it really takes off. That’s not to say they don’t have smart people or cool ideas, but nothing comes for free. Another point in this design space is mimblewimble, whose “blockchain” itself can actually be pruned to use up space proportional to the unspent outputs, this behaving even better than bitcoin in this particular aspect.

Empty blocks isn't about splitting the network though. They aren't verifying fake transactions; they're just not including legitimate ones. 51% means that half of all blocks generated will be empty.

Whether it's recognized as a currency or a commodity is irrelevant. If you've made income, the tax code says you need to report it. The tax code doesn't have a huge list of "recognized commodities" like pork bellies and soybeans. If you bought a shit-ton of obscure gold coins and cashed out at the height of the gold craze, you still made income. Your obscure gold coins aren't a currency, and their value doesn't even derive entirely from the inflated value of the gold commodity. 


Bitcoin doesn't have a point. It may have attracted a bunch of hardcore "big government is stealin my hard-earned cash" people, but bitcoin is just a protocol. I could make a lot of money by doing in-person cash trades of legitimate goods on the street, and it would be untraceable or unverifiable. That doesn't mean it'd be legal for me to not pay taxes on those earnings, and it isn't with bitcoin either. Go ahead and evade taxes, but take responsibility for it, and don't claim that bitcoin justifies it somehow.

These attacks have never (thus far) been flipping a switch from impossibly hard to super easy. They’ve progressively crept from impossibility to expensive possibility and possibly eventually to cheap possibility (e.g., md5 collisions; preimage is still hard as fuck even for md5)
So if this happens, it’s unlikely that all existing keys will suddenly move to 0 security. Instead, more probable that a high value target or two gets fucked after months of cracking by a supercomputer, everyone freaks out, changes algorithm, resets chain to pre-fuckup (probably very messy), and then all active users move their coins from outputs protected by unsafe crypto to outputs protected by safe crypto. Inactive users might get screwed if they’re above some threshold that makes the attack cost worthwhile against them.
Also worth mentioning that no cryptographic hash function out there has a practical preimage attack against it, and the bitcoin preimage attack needed to spend someone else’s coins would require finding a preimage that interpreted as an ECDSA key has a private side that the attacker can use. Or if you’re concerned about PoW, finding a double-SHA256 preimage seems monstrously more difficult than a single one (already monstrously difficult) and you’d need to be able to generate such double-preimages quickly to sneak in between everyone else’s blocks.

It’s not so much about spending as much as investing. A lot of finance hinges on a “risk-free rate” which is generally assumed to be the rate of return you’d get from leaving your money in a bank to earn interest. The higher that rate is, the more incentive you have to leave it there instead of investing in business, technology, real estate development, and other things that we consider to generally improve the state of the economy. As that rate goes up, investment goes down, and a deflationary currency increases it by its nature. It’s part of the reason we generally like low interest rates, a small but nonzero inflation rate, etc.
Not saying inflation is always great, but it seems pretty arrogant to say that Friedman is wrong or not to acknowledge the pros and cons of these various “parameters” of the economic machine.

I agree with your first sentence, but on your second, keep in mind that as with everything like this, there will be a lot of uncertainty and volatility on the way up if we were ever to get anywhere near that price. A lot of the hodlers today would happily cash out if we hit $20k again and then “crashed” back to $15k. And if they held on, perhaps they’d cash out at $30k. Or pick your number, but once most people hit their idea of life-changing amount of money, they’ll probably get rid of most of their coin. That will significantly lower the number of people who ever become literal billionaires through bitcoin, since the likelihood of someone making $40k/year and holding on without selling anything all the way up to tens or hundreds of millions of $ in bitcoin will be very low. You can be a hardcore believer and still have a rational sense of risk mitigation on the way up. I’d wager that the only ones who become bitcoin billionaires are the ones who already had a decent amount of money before bitcoin and didn’t see the few extra million $ they could gain along the way as life-changing enough to be worth cashing out their coin.

You really think people are reluctant about giving that information anonymously? In general it seems to me like ability to hodl after massive price increases would be quite correlated with income/wealth/security. If you’re living paycheck to paycheck and suddenly your $100 turns into $100k, you’re probably cashing most of it out for a down payment on a house, and you miss out on the other 10x appreciation a month later. If instead you’re pretty wealthy you can view those massive gains with more detachment because they’re not life-changing money, which then enables you to keep getting even richer.

Anyway, the total theoretical limit is 21 million BTC and we’ll never exceed that without a contentious hard fork. The amount in circulation today is a few million less than that, but impossible to calculate because some coins have been lost forever and we can’t monitor that.
More practically though, you can look at order books on the major exchanges out there. The ask side of their books rarely contains more than 10k coins on each of the big exchanges, and is often closer to 5k.

I keep seeing people say that as if it’s a smoking gun, but isn’t that literally what tether was created for? To give transparency (and trade across unbanked external parties) into the fiat balances of the world’s largest bitcoin exchange, right? So is it really surprising that when people deposit new fiat into a bitcoin exchange, perhaps they plan on doing something with it? And the reason you typically deposit fiat at a bitcoin exchange is probably to buy bitcoin, or you’d leave it somewhere else.
TBC, I’m not defending tether either, but the time correlation thing seems pretty bunk to me, unless I’m misunderstanding something.
And on the other hand, put yourself in bitfinex’s shoes: banks are notorious for wanting to steer clear of bitcoin, and we see posts daily in here from regular folks getting kicked off major banks for sending trivial amounts of money to Coinbase, the most reputable US bitcoin exchange. Now let’s say you have a couple billion USD in deposits you need to store at a legit major bank or several. If you publicly disclose you’re bitcoin related (like the audit everyone keeps demanding), you suddenly have a $2B check in the mail because your bank shut down your account and a ton of customers accuse you of fraud because that check isn’t very liquid until you put it somewhere else. If instead you don’t post a public audit, you get accused of being shady and people accuse you of printing money.
Contrast this with the more traditional “tried and true” mtgox approach: don’t attempt transparency, just talk about how many new users you’re getting and so on. Now nobody has any numbers to latch onto, and sure, you may be padding your reserves and order books as much as anyone, but because there’s no public record of how much money you claim to have on hand, the FUDsters seem content to leave you alone.
Anyway, I guess all I’m saying is that they’re not in an enviable position, and this sort of half-transparency seems doomed to fail and regress into complete opacity because we as a community are incentivizing that. I don’t see a clean way to achieve all the goals at once with the constraints we have in place. So even assuming bitfinex is completely honest, something’s going to give.

Eh, I remember back in the mtgox days there were regularly 500k BTC transactions and it made everyone uneasy but it didn't cause any panics that I know of. It later turned out to be a mtgox address and I guess MT had stashed 500k coins into a single address and kept sending small amounts plus epic massive change to other addresses (customers?). Huge addresses might not have quite the same human effect as early addresses but I imagine the thoughts going through everyone's minds are probably similar for both situations.

I think people would take it more seriously if you took the time to understand the common pitfalls of PoS protocols and anticipated questions about them. Not because you want to anticipate them but because you don’t go into research knowing that you have something better, and are rather looking for answers. Opening your proposal with “more secure than” without defining what you mean by security just sounds hypey, and with people churning out white papers up the wazoo to pump up their shitcoins, the rest of us need to look for indicators of good understanding or we’d spend all our time reading papers rehashing the same crap over and over again.
So more concretely: demonstrate that you understand the related work, be concrete when talking about how you’re secure, and be up-front about shortcomings. That last one in particular will set you apart because all the shitcoins have something to sell, and because chances are your thing isn’t an unequivocal win (very few things ever are) and if you don’t know your shortcomings you probably haven’t thought enough about it.

Current price is a misnomer. The prices you see reported on exchanges are price at which the last transaction occurred. Exchanges maintain order books of folks saying “I’m willing to buy/sell X BTC for $Y each”. Those get stacked in order of price and when the buys/sells intersect, a transaction occurs “eating into” the order book. The price of the most recent such match is the price you see reported on the exchange.

No problem. The faded ones are just recent states of the chart that show you how it looked a few minutes ago. It can be fun to watch the depth chart change as the price starts moving. A lot of the depth often disappears quickly because people get greedy. e.g., you thought you were willing to sell 100 BTC at $7000, but the price just spiked and you think it might be the beginning of a rally so you remove that order (so the right side of the valley gets shallower) and either sit on the coins for a while to see what happens, or move your limit order up to a higher price.
The red and green bars also indicate how the depth has changed over the past few minutes. Click the “WTF?” button in the upper right for more detail there.

I imagine there's a set legal precedent for you making this statement? As far as I'm concerned, they're pretty hazy legally. Either way, I don't think anyone would argue they're not property. They may be intangible, but you still "own" them. And in most jurisdictions I've looked at, accidental delivery of property to someone other than the intended recipient does not transfer ownership. They're expected to make a reasonable effort to return the items to their rightful owner and not act in (demonstrably) bad faith. If you honestly can't find the owner, there's nothing you can do about finding a wad of cash on the street (for example), and it's basically yours. If the guy in front of you dropped the cash, it's a different story.
In this case, the recipient instantly transferred the coins to mtgox and sold them all, then posted on facebook that he'd received $4000 of "free money". That isn't good faith in my books, regardless of the legal status of bitcoin as a currency.

You know, they could just be using a monotonically increasing value, as part of the standard yubikey auth exchange. Any crypto protocol worth its salt prevents replay attacks, so presumably yubikey encodes an increasing number into the key (possibly in no form visible to us) it sends over. In fact, I'd expect 99% of yubikey auth (including duplicate key rejection) is handled purely by yubikey itself, since its not in their best business interests to let individual companies fuck up authentication, since it's their reputation on the line.
Mtgox has fucked a lot of things up, but this is basic crypto and there are a lot of ways to prevent replays without storing arbitrarily many keys in a database.

It is cryptographically broken, but none of the attacks on it are at all relevant to what a cracker in this situation needs. Using SHA512 on a weak password would be no better.
So yes, it's an old hashing scheme, mostly broken from a cryptographic perspective, but it's still fine for this application. The collision attacks don't do anything for mining passwords, and even they aren't fully general to allow someone to come up with an "equivalent" password that hashes to the same thing (which would work to break into mtgox, but not if they wanted to break into other websites).
An iterated (à la PBKDF2) MD5 would be the best protection against brute force attacks. An iterated SHA-2 512 or whatever else would be marginally better, but only because it takes a little longer to compute. You want to make sure that the attacker expends as much time possible cracking your password, while not taking too long to hash it in legitimate cases.

Yeah. If you go to bitcoinity.org/markets you’ll see what looks like a valley on the lower half of the screen. The left/green side of that valley is called the “bids” and is a cumulative view of all “I’m willing to buy X BTC for $Y” orders. If you stare at it you’ll see it move even without any trading happening, because people change their minds and add or remove limit (what those are called) orders all the time. The red/right side is called “asks” and is the flip side for people who are willing to sell coins. The middle of the valley is where the action happens. The difference between the highest bid and the lowest ask is generally called the spread. And if someone talks about market depth, they’re talking about how steep the walls of the valley are, roughly. The steeper the walls, the “healthier” the market because you can buy/sell large amounts without the price changing as you do so, which is called slippage.
Imagine for example that you had 10k coins today and wanted to sell on bitfinex. Yes “the price” is $6745 right now, but you’d only sell a small handful of those 10k coins at that price, as you eat through lower and lower bids. If you just said “sell them all, I don’t care about the price” that’d be called a market order (equivalent to a limit order with a price of $0!) and you’d eat through a big chunk of the bid side of the book. As I’m writing this, that order would take you down to about $5000 per coin at the end and net you about $58M. Nice money, but not 10000*6745, and the ~$10M you lost were lost to slippage.
In practice outside of bitcoin, nobody makes huge market-moving orders like that because it loses money for no reason. If you have a big chunk of an asset to get rid of, you do it to private buyers or in small chunks over time so the market can recover and you minimize slippage. Some large players have entire teams dedicated to getting efficient execution of large orders like that, because when you’re trading billions even fractions of a percentage point in slippage can be millions lost. In bitcoin, it’s tradition to make huge orders like that (in either direction) in an effort to instill panic and get the market to move in a direction favorable to you. That’s generally considered market manipulation in the real world and will get you in lots of trouble on most markets.

If the coins can indeed be considered "mistakenly delivered property" (and I don't see why they couldn't be by a clueful judge/jury), then "Ben Davis" is ambiguously called a thief by Oregon law. Furthermore, as the value of the property is over $1000, that puts him into the real of "theft in the first degree", which is a class-C felony.

SHA256 is not encryption. Also, security is a lot more than throwing out well-known crypto algorithms and appending large numbers on them. You could be using SHA512 with AES256 and ECDSA (or ElGamal, just to be a bit more obscure) and still have gaping holes in your security system. On the flip side, you could be using MD5 as a hash function (the horror) and DES for encryption and be effectively impenetrable (although you might as well use better algorithms unless you have a good reason not to).

You just have to claim you "were hacked" and they'll give you your money back, and the seller will have lost money and coins. Having a good ebay rating or a verified paypal account doesn't change that, and even if it did, you'd still need to connect the identities in a secure manner, somehow.
People like moneypak on IRC because it's a lot harder to chargeback, so the seller is safe. There's also an extensive reputation system to further facilitate trades once you become well known.


Sure, but more likely it'll become scam-central for new users who aren't aware of all the security risks in trading that  goes to great lengths to inform people about and protect people from.
You're welcome not to like  but your complaints aren't specific to that IRC channel.

His own postings all over the internet bragging about getting free money, and boasting about how phantomcircuit screwed up and sent him money. The addresses are only pseudonymous, and given that Ben Davis (not actually his real name) instantly transferred the coins (from the address phantomcircuit accidentally sent to) to a non-anonymous exchange (mtgox), sold them, and then withdrew the money to a non-anonymous money service (dwolla), I don't think it'd be a very hard case to make. Especially given that Ben Davis is proudly going around telling everyone on IRC how he's buying new mining cards with phantomcircuit's money.

Really? With the price of GPUs these days, I feel like even a few million USD worth could get you some serious power:
Take bitcoinwatch.com's report that the total network power is about 8.3thash/s right now. That's 8,300ghash/s, or 8,300,000mhash/s. A $200 ATI 6950 can do about 350mhash/s. So adding about 24,000 of those cards to the network would roughly double the network power, and if they were all under a single entity, would grant that entity over 50% of the total processing power. 24,000 cards cost under $5M. Throw in another few million for supporting hardware, and subtract a couple probably for economy of scale-like stuff (bulk orders, specialized hardware). Then consider that $10M USD is small change for even smallish governments, especially under their "defense" budgets.
In fact, there are also countless private entities that could afford this kind of expenditure without breaking a sweat, if they thought it profitable to enter the bitcoin arena. We can only hope that whatever makes one of them interested will make more than one interested, so that rich entities of roughly the same scale can compete and prevent each other from acquiring majority control over the network. Not that &gt;50% would disintegrate the whole concept and make bitcoin irrelevant, but we'd need to be a lot more careful if we suspected someone had that much power.

I don't really understand the animosity bitcoinica seems to generate among some people, almost to the point of going on a crusade to convince other people not to use it. Yes, it's risky to use leverage, but that's true anywhere. If you're not risk-averse, then you might use it, otherwise you might not. You can make more money more quickly and you can lose more money more quickly. They aren't transparent, but neither are many financial entities in the real world. If you're worried about legal liability, there's a real company behind it and people know who Zhou Tong is.
All Zhou is doing in this thread is admitting that trading (in one direction) has to stop for a little until he can do something about the empty USD reserves. A shadier establishment could've taken the website offline and cited "technical difficulties" until they could move more USD into their mtgox account. In fact, since I'm sure they have lots of BTC, they could've easily just sold a big load on mtgox and simultaneously lowered the price and generated USD. But that could be perceived as trading against their customers, since most of their customers are long right now.
Bitcoinica's trading practices may not be transparent, but nor are many real-world financial institutions'. Zhou has, however, shown himself time and time again willing to put himself out there to respond to any criticism in a polite and educated manner, regardless of how ridiculous the claims leveled against him are. If anything, this maneuver should show that he isn't operating a bucket shop, and that he is indeed performing trades on the behalf of his customers. He's providing the valuable service of giving people (often high, risky) leverage and more advanced order types than other exchanges, and for that he gets paid spread. If the price isn't worth it to you, don't use it.
Basically, LEAVE ~~BRITNEY~~ ZHOU ALONE!

Bitcoin is a protocol, not any concrete implementation thereof. Sharing code, history, and so on is irrelevant if nodes can’t speak to each other.

If you know it for a fact, you borrow as many bitcoins as you can get your grubby hands on, sell them today, then buy them back tomorrow, give the lender back his coins, and keep the difference.
For example, say I lent you 500 coins now. You run off to mtgox, sell them for $2500 total. Tomorrow the market crashes to $0.01 per coin. You buy back 505 coins (say I want interest) for $5.05, and keep $2494.95 as profit. Or you could buy back a crapload more coins if you think the market will rebound.

Because phantomcircuit didn't transfer ownership; he transferred possession. BenDavis acquired possession of the coins through no fault of his own, but that's not the issue here. The issue is that he then actively deprived phantomcircuit of ownership of his coins by transferring them to a site, and selling them (an act that is only justified if you own the coins).
If I lend my neighbor my car, it still belongs to me, even though it's in his possession. Hell, even if he's doing me a favor and house-sitting for me (and is thus "in possession" of my house), he does not own my house. If he goes and sells my car or my furniture (or even my house), he is actively (and some would say forcefully, in an abstract way) taking possession of my property, because for a sale to be legal, you need to own the thing being sold. In fact, you could even not have something in your possession and still be able to sell it (many people buy precious metals online, or futures in commodities, and so on).
Note that in my examples with my hypothetical neighbor, there was no written contract involved. I didn't hire a lawyer and write out a 100-page contract stipulating that "I am temporarily transferring possession of my car and house to you, but you must not sell it or otherwise act as if it belongs to you." But if he did go and sell it, there's no question that he would be found guilty of theft of my property.
Of course, in phantomcircuit's case, it wasn't an intentional transfer of possession. But the fact that the transfer stemmed from a mistake on phantomcircuit's part doesn't mean he actively decided to transfer ownership to BenDavis, only that he transferred possession to him. Property law exists specifically so that we can strive to only transfer ownership voluntarily. If you take it further, it should be not only voluntary also non-fraudulent: me voluntarily transferring money last week to a con-man and then receiving nothing in return counts as a non-voluntary transfer of ownership as soon as he disappeared, and makes the con-man a thief. And even if you don't want to call it theft, it's at least [conversion](
The use of force against BenDavis is thus a natural consequence of honoring ownership and not possession. He stopped being a passive participant in this debacle the moment he decided to sell all the coins, depriving phantomcircuit of his ownership, and became a thief. And I think thievery is worthy of (only mildly, on this scale) violent intervention.
@_date: 2011-09-03 21:12:20
As far as most people I know are concerned, the one place violence is warranted is to enforce property rights. Unless they're full-blown anarchists, most people agree that property rights need external enforcement (from a g*vernment) stemming from a set of established principles of ownership. Without it, whoever's strongest or has the biggest guns gets to take/have as much as they want.
So yes, I think it's more than justified in this case.

There wasn't a liquid market back then, so any single price doesn't give the full picture. Transactions were all over the map and this pizza deal probably went down because the number was round and there wasn't much precedent for what coins should be worth. It was one of the first nontrivial transactions of bitcoin for tangible goods.
To put it differently, your friends and you have a ton of bottle caps and for fun want to see how a Fallout universe currency would work. Your friend wants a pizza and you offer to get him one for bottle caps if he makes you a good offer. He says what the hell have 1000 caps. After that first transaction, folks start treating caps as being worth $pizza/1000 each and an exchange rate is born.

Arguing for stuff is harmless when you have no power to enact it.

Can we stop calling it 2mb? The actual usable limit if segwit2x passes will be around 8mb, assuming miners don't artificially limit it and transactions take advantage of it.

For reference, I'm running a full node right now and it's using something like 140GB on my machine. If you decided to participate as a full node in the network today, you'd have to download and verify those 140GB and basically keep them around forever (there are proposals to prune that but they have downsides). That's all of bitcoin history with 1MB blocks; if we bumped it to 2MB we'd potentially double the rate of growth of that database. Disk space might be cheap but bandwidth still isn't for most people, and being a full node means participating in a p2p network, which means you aren't just downloading each block once and storing it, but regularly relaying things to other p2p nodes. Thus an 8x block size increase could realistically put bandwidth requirements outside of reach for folks with mediocre internet connections, increasing centralization.
There's also subtler discussion on future viability/profitability of mining, with larger blocks. Unless we actually want price of bitcoin to increase forever or mining to dwindle, the miners need to get paid, and with block rewards decreasing geometrically over time, fees are supposed to compensate the miners. Just bumping block size whenever blocks start filling up is basically artificially injecting supply (of transaction capacity) into a market and will put downward pressure on fees per transaction byte. If we increase block space supply beyond demand for it (number of transactions), there's basically no reason to add fees to transactions because there's no opportunity cost for miners to include fee-less transactions in a block. If taken to the extreme, that means that miners can never expect fees to be a significant source of income and block rewards will need to be sufficiently big (in $) to cover their costs and add profit.
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:23:25
Because blind faith is the only way you reach 100% certainty in inherently unpredictable events, and blind faith isn't a particularly useful or rational approach to anything much. For anything less than 100% certainty, diversification is beneficial.
@_date: 2017-07-19 14:00:21


Can you explain to me how you reconcile that viewpoint with the fixed total supply of coins and the value of mining?
This is how I understand it: over time, mining reward decreases geometrically, and transaction fees are expected to incentivize miners to continue to mine. With no limits on block size, how does a fee market arise? If a miner can just shove all outstanding transactions into a block with no limit and effectively no marginal cost to doing so, why wouldn't they? The block size limit creates scarcity for mining transactions so as to create market forces in transaction fees. This has the net effect (in theory at least) of allowing miners to keep mining way into the future when block rewards are negligible, as well as aligning the incentives of the miners and transaction producers with those of the overall network, because even though mining extra transactions may have ~zero marginal cost to the miners if there's no block size limit, it has a major cost to the overall network in that the transactions must be stored forever and transmitted to all peers.
So tl;dr: I haven't come across the "no limits" viewpoint before; many people debate what the limit should be and I'm not opining (here at least) about what that should be, but it seems weird to advocate for none at all.

Bigger blocks, yes, but we're talking about no limits. I buy the higher volume of low-fee txns with a bigger block limit, but why would anyone use fees at all if there's no limit whatsoever? Ignoring the economics of it, it's just a limit argument: as blocks get higher limits, fees go down, and volume goes up (but tapers off since there's finite demand for txns). In the limit, fees approach zero

Who's saying that it isn't silly? My point is that I'm fine writing off fringe viewpoints like POW change because there's very low likelihood of them happening.

A cartel of a majority of miners pushing for an untested haphazard hard fork is much scarier to me, because there's a real chance it could happen and wreak havoc.
All I'm saying is that crazy ideas are fine by me if they won't affect me, so comparing bitmain's "speech" to Luke's doesn't do much to reassure me. One of them is fringe, and the other has real power over the entire network.

Transactions are tiny programs that consume inputs (i.e., satisfy the requirements of each input transaction’s tiny program). Because the code can vary and so can the number of inputs, transactions can vary a lot in size.
Imagine you accept “tips” from some source and are constantly getting single digit satoshi donations. When you decide to spend the money from those hundreds of tips (at once, because they’re all small), the transaction spending them is going to be significantly larger than one that just spends a small number of inputs.

No, I used overstatement for comedic effect. What I actually did was ask how you had concluded that they're toxic enough for you not to want them in the community (going so far to say that they are acting in their own best interests against those of the community) despite their extensive contributions to all aspects of it. You replied with one example of a thing you personally consider important that they had not contributed to. I then mocked your rationale hoping you'd provide more. That's about it, no straw men.

Well, it's also an instant arbitrage opportunity, given that you can get ~450-500$ for them. Buy low, instantly sell high, make free money.

[My other comment]( got me thinking:
Currently most payment systems side predominantly with the buyer. As a seller, you will occasionally get fraudulent chargebacks that generally cost more money to fight than to accept. This means, other things equal, that sellers will charge a higher price for goods and services, to amortize the chargeback losses across transactions.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is irreversible. This means that a shady seller has most of the power. Symmetrically, since if I'm a buyer, I run the risk of not getting my goods after paying for them, I will demand a lower price to amortize the risk of loss.
Conclusion: NOT ONLY IS IT THE BEE'S KNEES: BITCOIN LOWERS PRICES SYSTEMWIDE!

Hey guys, this guy read an article. He pretty much has to be right.

Having said that, they can make it supremely hard to work with bitcoin. In a shittier world, ISPs could implement packet filtering, there could be legal penalties for operating a bitcoin node ("facilitating money laundering" seems to be pretty popular), and anonymizing networks could be similarly hindered by government intervention. That's not to say that the determined couldn't still use bitcoin, but let's not pretend they couldn't have a huge negative impact if they chose to.

I know it's a good snarky answer, but seriously, I think it's an interesting question because everyone keeps saying it without really elaborating. Is the distinctive criterion a negative expected value? Or what?

Then we'd be getting the guy on the other side saying "I sent a guy some coin for a computer and it never got here and now I don't know who to report!" :) it's a tough problem. We all agree that PayPal sucks, but siding unconditionally with the seller isn't necessarily better. It just shifts the fuckage elsewhere.

Yeah, but holding your money for a year and then giving it back to you on the terms (by far) most favorable to them is pretty shady. This is far worse than losing a couple of percent to inflation.

Yes, and with way less depth I can buy a handful of those cheap coins before it pays to move back to MtGox. It's all about the network effects, and nobody wants to be the first to move. Exchanges are one of those things where I don't particularly want a bunch of competing alternatives.

Not having a say in it doesn't stop most people around here from "disliking" it.

If nobody else thinks you own the coins, then what value does owning them have?

If you didn't look like such a troll (negative karma, etc.) people would probably take what you're saying more seriously. Given the number of random abusive people with nothing useful to say on the net, having the mannerisms of a troll is a surefire way to make sure your message is ignored, no matter how valid it may be.

I like the idea, but nothing about it requires bitcoin, does it? You could have the same system backed by The Payment Site That Shall Not Be Named.

That's a controversial statement?

Regardless of regulation, some companies may want to institute policies stronger than what regulation requires to send a message about what they consider ethical to their employees, or to be able to tell clients that there is close to no risk of employees acting against their interests.
For example some compliance departments might prevent you from taking short-term (&lt;6mo) profits, even if they allow you to trade personally if you disclose all your trades.

I got the impression that old ripple and new ripple are different things. The old one predates bitcoin but someone bought it and replaced the ripple scheme with something else (still calling it ripple). Is that wrong?
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:43:52
There are two fees. There's the user-settable one in the preferences screen that applies to all transactions you make, and there's a built-in tiny one that gets triggered if your transaction is particularly large. You can't turn the tiny one off in the standard client (although the protocol doesn't require it), and that's what this thread is about. At least that's how things worked last time I looked.
