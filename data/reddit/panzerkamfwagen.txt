I think this conversation need to end. At this point there is no need to continue it.

Well some people have to drive long distances and do stuff besides argue on Reddit over a measly subject as this. This subject is not contingent to the real world and all insults are fallacious, giving no merit or validity to your arguments.

Its better to answer questions instead of becoming a cynical asshole about things. Everyone has questions that need to be answered, including yourself. So don't persecute someone for asking a question, instead answer the fucking question as  much as possible from your perspective.

There is no need to be dick man. The man is questioning the quality and availability of an ASIC. And more or less of a reputable company to purchase from. So your pessimistic posts are not needed.

There are very few asic manufacturers, as for the ones I know are BFL and Avalon. He is also unsure if you read his post, He does not know whether the is more out there, so effective he is fishing for results in order to get an idea of what is actually going on in the ASIC Bitcoin Community. He also want reassurance in (a) product(s). What he doesn't need is a guy harassing him on the premise of his post.

We are all "Lookie-loos" till we buy a product but until then we are tob e presumed as such. Seeing as how he has only wasted your time, cause it takes an effort insult someone for questioning a subject like "If anyone has purchased an ASIC". Just like in gambling your likely to ask an ambiguous question when learning how to play cards, craps, slots(cant be learned), or roulette.

First off no need to be an asshole and you don't know if he has money to spend on ASICs.
