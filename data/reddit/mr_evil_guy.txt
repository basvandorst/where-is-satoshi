As the author notes, many are cold-storage wallets associated with exchanges, and Satoshi has &gt;1.1 million BTC that will probably never move.  A really interesting stat is that 1/3 of all BTC sitting in these 'megawallets' has never been withdrawn, suggesting they'll be locked away for a long time.

Every time we've dipped below $6000 this, the market bought up BTC and pushed it back over.  But we've had numerous lower highs, and until we make a higher high I think the bears are still in control.

Yes, that's a big rumor going on right now (not saying it's untrue, just that there isn't really a smoking gun).

I certainly agree there.  The 2015 crash seemed to be fueled by a crisis of confidence in BTC itself.  The world's largest exchange lost almost a million BTC and China banned cryptocurrencies, so it appeared the market was doomed.  The current bear market has more to do with the shitcoin bubble popping.  I have much more confidence that BTC will survive and thrive now than I did back in 2015.  


Lol, I thought that was established to a certain extent already.  We've had a bunch of encouraging news and developments come out this year despite the bear market, but every other post is someone freaking out about the price.

During January 12-14, 2015 BTC dropped from $269 to $173 after already bleeding out a full year, then never went that low again.  Considering how closely the 2018 crash is following the 2015 one, I'm expecting another capitulation event before the next bull run is sparked.

Do you mean instant fiat deposits from a debit card or bank account?  Gemini is pretty popular and apparently does instant deposits, but I've never used them so I can't really comment.  Outside of exchanges, you could find sellers around you on LocalBitcoins but that can be risky obviously.  
Coinbase has instant debit card purchases for purchases but you can only withdraw fiat to a bank account.

I think that's a hard argument to make.  Outside of jewelry and being a store of value, gold is extremely important for the electronics industry and STEM research.  A lot more industries rely on gold right now than they do BTC (which is obvious, since BTC has been around less than a decade).  
Give BTC more time to integrate into everyday society and then I'll find the argument more believable.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:13:38
Of course there is, that's why it's illegal in regulated markets.  Whales dumping their coins on regular people goes against the spirit of crypto.  But what's stopping them?  It's been extremely profitable for them, and profits are why the large majority of us are in crypto.  Until the market grows much larger and/or undergoes serious regulations, manipulation will continue.

When I started buying earlier this year, I had convinced myself that there was usually a winter bull-run every year.  Looking at the 2014 crash, which is the most comparable period to 2018 in terms of price action, there was a pump in early November then a crash to new lows from mid-Nov to mid-Jan 2015.  If the current market plays out the same way, I would expect a pump from the $6000s to the $8000-$9000s before briefly flash crashing to sub $5K.  That would be the most convincing sign to me that the bear market is over.  
Of course, BTC is stronger and has a more positive reputation now than it did back in 2014-15.  I wouldn't be totally surprised if the bull run got underway much sooner.

I'm so conflicted reading articles like this.  Almost everyone who was "financially ruined" had invested way too much at one time into things they knew too little about. Combine that with a lack of basic risk management or awareness that we were in a huge speculative bubble, and that's how these situations occur.  
Still, I hate seeing new investors get swept up in the hype like this.  Their money went to scammers, shitcoin dev teams, and whales manipulating the market. Now they are bitter and pessimistic about cryptocurrency, and may never come back. Had they just entered the market a month or two earlier, they would have saved so much money and possibly made some nice gains.

If you believe in BTC long-term, DCA over the next several months.  If you don't believe in BTC or just want to make quick profits, you should stay away.  I'm bullish on BTC long-term (3-5 years) but I don't believe we will see any kind of mood-shift this year.

Linux is intimidating as fuck for "regular people" to use, but Google took the underlying technology and made it user-friendly and accessible to the mass market.

I think Coinbase is just trying to steer people toward the service that will most benefit them.  Grandmas and crypto noobs aren't looking at charts or worrying about limit v. market orders; they just want to send someone money and get BTC back.  Coinbase is great for that, and they charge a pretty high fee for that convenience.  Coinbase Pro/GDAX is for people who actually know what they're doing, and don't freak out when looking at charts.

On the surface yes, but the purchasing power of a dollar is always decreasing.  $1 in 1988 got you much farther than a $1 in 2018 ( and it's almost a guarantee this trend will continue.  Going by the current rate, the USD will have only 50-75% of today's purchasing power in 2048. 
Will BTC be worth more in 30 years than it is now? Who knows. It could revolutionize the world, it could be overtaken by another crypto, or maybe even a new technology will come along that makes blockchain obsolete entirely. All I know is that over the last ten years, BTC has consistently gained wider use and appreciation (let alone value), so it seems silly not to keep some of my net worth in it.

It's definitely something I will look into down the line, but right now a hardware wallet would cost as much as my entire Bitcoin balance.  A "free" paper wallet seemed like a better place to start.

I've heard many people suggest keeping &gt;50% of your portfolio in "stable" coins like ETH and BTC, and using the rest of your investment to speculate on mid- and low-market cap coins.  I've generally followed that approach since I started investing.

Hayes openly admits that he doesn't care about the price, he cares about the volatility.  A price prediction from Arthur Hayes is about as useful as the price prediction threads on this subreddit (i.e. not at all).

If I'm understanding you correctly, are you suggesting I hold my coins in a wallet like Blockchain, Mycelium, etc. and do a single large push to my paper wallet from there?

The biggest thing for me is that $100 of Bitcoin is about what I make per month mining right now (running a single 1080 atm).  It's not so much the dollar amount that I'm worried about, it's the time invested.  I'm much more comfortable losing $100 over a parking ticket than losing $100 of Bitcoin that took a month to acquire, if that makes any sense.  And of course, if I keep mining at the exact same rate I'll be &gt;$1,000 by the end of the year and I don't want there to be *any* uncertainty about my crypto storage when I reach that point.  
Putting a good strategy together now will give me confidence to get more deeply involved in crypto, either by building a mining rig or investing in coins directly.  Should that happen, a hardware wallet is definitely something I will consider.  
"I recommend to have a smartphone wallet..." - Forgive me if this is an obvious question, but are smartphone wallets more secure than browser-based wallets like Blockchain?  In both cases it seems like you need an active internet connection for the private key to be verified, so wouldn't the risk be similar?
"For low fees check  " - I don't entirely understand these charts.  Where can I learn more?
Thanks for your input.

I'm not totally convinced we're out of trouble just yet.  If anything, I expect us to top out somewhere below $9000, drop to the $5000s, and then start a slow recovery.  Would love to be wrong though.

Agreed.  I just deposited fiat on Coinbase the other day, even though I'm not buying any coin for at least a few weeks.  You can always withdraw the money back to your account if you decide against buying.  
@_date: 2018-07-01 19:38:53
Do you have an account on an exchange?  You will need to use an exchange that has BTC/fiat market.  I personally use Coinbase since it's the cheapest option for Americans.

Yep.  A friend of mine who is a total cryptonoob almost bought Bitcoin Cash accidentally.  I managed to stop him in time, and he gave me a puzzled look and asked "Isn't this Bitcoin??"  I had to go into a fairly lengthy explanation before he understood the difference.  
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:11:23
I'm expecting a healthy correction between 8500-9000 (based solely on how the last few months have gone), but if we get past that range then things will get really interesting.

My first (small) BTC purchase was in February at a price of $8600.  Since then, I've been making small to medium sized purchases whenever I felt the price was due to rebound.  My DCA price right now is around $7500, and that coupled with my mining income and trading alts has netted a ~20% profit.  The highest price I bought at was $9,995.00, and the lowest was $6300.

Shitposts are probably my favorite things to read on this sub. All the baseless predictions about the market and prices are infuriatingly stupid. Most people here don't know anything about the technology either, so those conversations are generally dull and uninformative. 
Memes and discussions of crypto news are what make this sub worth visiting, IMO.

You're spending your first paycheck on a mining rig, and you don't even know if you'll make anything?  Honestly that sounds like a really bad idea.  My advice would be to just put that money into crypto directly.
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:08:05
BTC dominance is the highest it's been since December, so I'm expecting money to shift into alts within the next week or two.    
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:01:57
I agree.  I just saw a news piece about a jeweler in Silicon Valley who started accepting crypto last year at the suggestion of some customers.  He estimates that 20% of every purchase in his store is now made with crypto.  
This is what real world adoption looks like.  This is how crypto can fulfill its potential and make a meaningful impact on the global financial system.

Soros Fund Management gave approval to its overseer to start trading crypto in early April. Passport Capital started two crypto funds earlier this year and is seeking $150 million in funding.  A lot of crypto businesses are acquiring Wall Street executives to add legitimacy and draw the attention of traditional investors and investment firms.  We certainly have a long way to go, but I think there's more "big money" interest in crypto now than ever before.

If you have &lt;$500 in crypto then I really don't see how spending $60-$100 on a HW wallet is justified.  For most people with investments that small, it's "screw around" money anyway and losing it won't be devastating financially.  And if $500 *is* a life-changing amount of money, why the hell are you investing it in crypto? 
I have less than $500 invested and keep all my coins on desktop wallets.  Yeah it isn't the most secure storage method, but as long as the user has good safety practices it's pretty good.

I imagine people are waiting to see which direction BTC goes after moving sideways the last 10 days.  The community seems fairly split about whether BTC will move back to &gt;$8K or continue dropping to &lt;$6K over the next few days/weeks.
Personally, I'm hoping the end of tax season sparks further interest for US investors.

Once its value increases more, I will start using it to make purchases so I can get "discounts" (and promote adoption, of course).  For now I'm just investing in a few alts and HODLing the rest.  
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:52:34
I invested in both LTC and BCH when I first got into crypto.  Both are great for moving value around, but there is nothing BCH can do that LTC can't do equally as well or better.  Not to mention that Charlie is a way better crypto ambassador than Roger (by a fucking country mile), and the LTC community isn't complete cancer.  The more I learned about BCH, the more I wanted out.     
Thank goodness BCH pumped the last week+ so I could sell my whole stack for profit.  I still think BCH is a decent project, but holy shit do I dislike the people associated with it.  Funny enough, if they stuck with the "it's like Bitcoin, *but better*" angle that most new coins use, I would be fine with it.  I'm even cool with the name Bitcoin Cash.  But they had to start bloviating about "Satoshi's vision" (like any of these idiots know Satoshi, what his current thoughts are on BTC, etc.) and using extremely deceptive tactics to confuse newcomers.  Their advertising, more than anything, proved to me that there is nothing innovative about BCH and that it's purely an attempt to piggyback off the BTC name.

Donations to him aren't, but spreading awareness of BTC is.  Even if just 0.1% of his followers ever Google what a "bitcoin" is, that's still a lot of people learning about cryptocurrency and potentially becoming interested in the market.  Guys like Ninja are the reason why PUBG and Fortnite are two of the hottest games out right now, so he definitely holds some influence.
Also, if Ninja can show that people are willing to donate crypto, other streamers may begin accepting it as a payment method as well.

Look at the buy/sell chart since the beginning of 2017, and compare it to the USD value of BTC and various alts.  These spikes in buy pressure usually precede or coincide with bull runs.

Same, I spent about a week learning everything I could before I invested a penny into crypto.  Thankfully it was during a period when I had some free time so it didn't take me away from much.  However, I don't expect most people who work 9-5 with a family at home to commit that kind of time.
