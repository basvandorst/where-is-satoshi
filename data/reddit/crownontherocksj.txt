Thanks, that's really somethin, hopefully things get better over there sooner rather than later. My ex gf was born in Caracas and she went there for school for several months to study. I know a little about the economy and politics etc. there. Things will turn around.

I think so, I use a debit card linked to a wallet and it charges me one rate and adjusts it later, was guessing this might work similarly, but who knows. For something that fluctuates so much, especially lately, there has got to be creative ways of dealing with it.

I don't see why the type of currency someone uses would affect a credit company.....by that logic they should be anti paper money too...

I think it will be worth around  $10k then.
Honest/optimistic yet still realistic estimate I believe.

I just did a test and went to the sub, scrolled through, and I can say the mix of what I saw in the first 20 or so posts was actually kinda cool. There is a little bit of everything, and from I've seen over the months is that it's one of the more worthwhile and positive places on Reddit to be honest. I understand the complaints, but there are far worse corners of the internet.

What are some other good wallets for Android?
