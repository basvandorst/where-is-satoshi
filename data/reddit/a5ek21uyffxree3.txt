All your bitcoins can be taken from your deposit box, converted to your local currency and deposited to your bank account.
"Finance Minister Nadia Valavani revealed to Greek television that the government and banks had already agreed that people would also not be allowed to withdraw cash from safe deposit boxes for as long as the controls were in place.  This may be part of a fallback plan if the ECB ends its bailout of the Greek banks.  The government with the banks' connivance would seize the cash euros stored in these boxes and compensate their lessees by crediting an equal sum of euros to their increasingly inaccessible checking deposits.  The cash would then be fed into ATMs to postpone the day of reckoning for Greece's zombie fractional-reserve banks." -
