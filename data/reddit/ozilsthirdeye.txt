A little message pops up on Coinbase once i hit send
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:56:41
i do not believe so. When i go to my wallet it is not listed as a transaction or is there some other place where id check that 
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:44:25
It did at first. the first transaction i did showed up as "pending" or something like that, it was above my original purchase of BTC earlier today. after awhile it went away and was not replaced by anything. it just disappeared. after that, every single transaction I did after that did not show anything either. it isn't reflected in my coinbase balance either.

No, today I bought BTC on Coinbase, but I already had a wallet on electrum. I had been familiar with electrum and when i gave a friend my address and he sent me btc it said "pending"
so i buy btc on coinbase and i copy my address from the "addresses" section on electrum and paste that into coinbase and hit send 
it says something something transaction sent
then it said pending or something of that nature on my transactions list, but it disappeared. it never said pending or anything in my wallet electrum 
i tried again and again on coin base today and it says sent, but my btc balance doesn't change and on the transaction log nothing appears at all other then my original purchase today. all of this has been in the span of a 5 or so hours

yes it all worked out finally

Yeah, that's what I have read so do I have to have an offline wallet? I'm not sure what that means, but I have seen bread wallet is recommended. Should I transfer from Coinbase to the middle wallet to the sports book and then my winnings the same way, but backwards? 
How do I do said transfers? Is their individual codes set to each account?

lol the closest one is 100 miles away
is there anyway I could get like $25 worth of bitcoin by tomorrow (if i'm in the US)
@_date: 2016-01-20 01:25:04
lol no idk what i just did but somehow it finally went through thank you!
edit: celebrated prematurely it is stuck on pending and didn't go thru quickly
