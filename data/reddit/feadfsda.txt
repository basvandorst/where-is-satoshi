no dude its fucking stupid. this is your family. only the -incredibly- desperate shill their family. 
typical bitcoiner. you don't care who you suck in, as long as you can cash out at a profit.

no, see I just implied that you follow a similar mindset to people who are dumb enough to get wrapped up in such schemes. I'll say it again: typical bitcoiner. you only read, see, and interpret what is convenient for you. 
also, bitcoin does follow those metrics you outlined. if you aren't constantly getting new money "cashing in" to bitcoin, you wouldn't have the liquidity as an early adopter to "cash out". I don't see how this is fundamentally different from any other "get rich quick" scheme that has come along in the past several thousand years.
good luck out there; you're going to need it.

good for you? you know powerball tickets are only 2 dollars but the upside potential is in the millions. maybe you should get in on that too.
also you don't need to respond to this. no one actually gives a shit.

the great thing about the market is it doesn't care what your "mindset" is. you're stuck on one track and you refuse to get off it despite the obvious flaws that have been exposed time and time again in your thinking. the great thing about the market is I don't even have to be reading the same book as you, I just have to be right, which, I probably am. 
time will tell of course. but nobody in their right mind is really worried about bitcoin in any way shape or form. its just entertainment.

lmao "bitcoin calculator". jesus christ and I'm supposed to be the moron. 
hey man, enjoy your mining rig and bitcoins. I'm sure someday you'll be able to idk use it to play WoW and farm a real currency.

well you obviously own bitcoin. if you don't plan on selling them and you don't plan on spending them then what exactly are you going to use them for?


of course it won't, but I'm sure you like to think you're still "making a difference". typical pyramid/ponzi scheme sucker's attitude to be quite honest. 
longer than you.

lmao dude you sound frustrated by last years price action. calm down little man. its just money, you can always go out and make more.

I think you're naive. 
people very frequently get robbed and killed over xbox craigslist postings. you want me to honestly hand any sizeable amount of cash over to a stranger I met minutes ago on the internet?
I can't believe you've lived as long as you have. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 05:15:04
woooooow. I can make up numbers too.

you know the funny thing is that whole "a pizza was sold for 10k bitcoins" really only shows how truly worthless these things are. a pizza sold for 10k coins once, and there is -no- reason whatsoever that it can't happen again. 
also, microsoft does -not- accept bitcoin. bitpay accepts bitcoin. microsoft only accepts dollars from established governments. just because microsoft allows bitpay to magically convert bitcoins into USD for them does -not- mean microsoft accepts bitcoin. 
good luck.

so what is this, a booth dedicated to showing people how they too can run hardware at a loss?
