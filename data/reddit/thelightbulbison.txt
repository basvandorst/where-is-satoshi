One where I'm not a victim of my surroundings.
You don't *have* to live in a market society. It's a big world, there are other options available. But let's be honest, you life a comfortable lifestyle, and you're willing to trade your labor to the bourgeoisie in order to maintain that lifestyle. And the self-loathing you feel for being too risk-averse to strike out on your own manifests itself in victimhood because god forbid your ego actually accept that niggling fact.

Your perception of what "options" are is stultifying, and truncated. You should work on that, or don't.

Having money is not necessary to survive, it just makes things easier.)

Aye. There's the rub. *Other people* (read: "the system") are responsible for your fate, not you?

Is proletariat your term for risk-averse, uncreative, submissive drones incapable of creating their own destiny? Your perception of humanity is a grim one.
You can call it victim-blaming. But by the same token you'd also have to classify someone who opts for consensual sex and, dissatisfied, retroactively cries rape, a victim.

Words mean things. It's a shame how quickly some folks are willing to forget that
