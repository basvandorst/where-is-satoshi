I buy all mine at litebit.eu via SEPA transfer, found them after having a nightmare trying to get onto coinbase and haven't had any problems with them so far :)

Shit my coins haven't left Exodus wallet since I first bought in back in early 2017, hell I don't even open it to check in months. Now I'm paranoid lol

I was proud of achieving 1 ETH and I think same week I fell for a phishing scam and had it yoinked lol, made me completely rage-quit crypto but I guess at least I learned a great lesson that day!

The scam was an exact duplicate of OmiseGo airdrop website. Of course I was still very new to crypto and didn't understand really the difference of my public and private key. If I had just done some quick research I would have realized the OMG would be added to my wallet automatically, but perhaps better to get scammed then instead of continuing to invest and lose a lot more! Here's the scammer's wallet (one of them at least) if you're curious, seems he got about 20 ETH on this one, though I don't doubt he scammed a lot more over multiple wallets and sites -  [
