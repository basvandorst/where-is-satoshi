Yes the issue is finally resolved. Definitely not a coincidence. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:57:34
Thanks man. Yeah I’ve been bugging them in every channel I could think of. I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt but 1 month is testing my patience. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:33:30
Yeah I was a fool. I’ve just never had a bad experience with gdax until now. I’m using Gemini until I can get ID verified on bitstamp. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:01:48
This is great advice, and generally I've always done so. The thing is, I'm no noob to crypto, and have held a gdax account since 2015. I was just conducting business as usual and this time around, the BTC was never credited to my account, just been stuck on pending for the last 30 days.

Frustrating because what else could I do?
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:06:14
Have you tried their phone line? It hasn't been helpful for me but it may be helpful for you.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:02:17
I’ve had good luck with Gemini and binance. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:36:55
tl;dr check out other exchanges because GDAX is currently a mess
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:45:50
Pending 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:05:52
Damn. sorry to hear that. Did you deposit fiat or crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:29:09
Thanks for the reply, Justin. It’s a relief to finally have this resolved. I hope that despite all of my frustration, you’ll agree that I tried my best to refrain from outright slandering you guys since I have had a great experience on CB/GDAX until this incident. 
I’m sure if you do some digging, you can see I reached out through EVERY CHANNEL possible (short of visiting the office in person). Like I’ve mentioned before in reply to others in this thread- everybody, incl myself, understands that you guys are overextended due to the unprecedented volume of interest in crypto this year. Despite that, what I felt was inexcusable were the dismissive responses- both on email and from the phone support staff. The “maybe you didn’t use high enough of a fee” or “pls be patient and just wait” type of response I received is perhaps more frustrating than not receiving a response at all. There’s more to building a successful support team and PR than just meeting KPIs like avg response time or number of interactions before a resolution. I’m sure you guys know this, and are doing your best to work it out. 
Despite this rough patch, you guys have played a tremendous role in making a hyper technical and inherently complex product accessible to the masses and in a lot of ways, the bitcoin/crypto  community owes a debt of gratitude to Coinbase for that. 
I hope you’ll agree it’s only fair that you DM me the next 3 coins and the corresponding dates launching on CB as compensation for missing the massive selling opportunity at 19.5k/BTC, I’ll look out for your response in my inbox (lol jk amirite)

Yeah I'm in the same boat.. No one actually helpful on the phone lines. It's just so irresponsible to esp given the amount of money we're dealing with
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:25:51
Yeah the deposit is still showing as pending T__T
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:25:07
looks like the 19k or the 25k guy is going to take the cake
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:43:27
Yeah no idea why it’s deleted 
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:31:31
They really are. Profiting, manipulating, and controlling as banks have always done. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:23:40
They state themselves that you’ll be credited after 3 confirmations (30 minutes on average). You’re telling me that 6 or 7 DAYS in a market as volatile as crypto is acceptable for one of the forerunner US exchanges? Wtf
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:34:02
What’s wrong with warning current and potential new users about poor experiences with one of the most visible exchanges in the crypto space?
@_date: 2017-12-30 12:39:26
Yes thank you to everyone!
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:49:36
Nope, all other transfers have gone through just fine. Just the one time it was a decent amount I get fucked. Just my luck right?
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:36:27
Good to hear. Yeah usually coinbase is great, but as soon as you need to reach their support team, different story.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:47:43
Yeah I hear you re: not being able to handle the volume of new users on-boarding onto the Coinbase platform. I’m trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but after missing so many good market opportunities, I’m starting to grow bitter. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:59:40
Whatever my Nano suggested at the time for “fast transaction”
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:00:32
I hope you and me both get our crypto back
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:17:36
You will be able to buy $10 us dollars very soon 
@_date: 2016-06-16 20:06:59
That's the million dollar question. The real answer is no one knows. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:45:50
lol, silly morgan.
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:52:36
I dare you OP
@_date: 2016-12-30 19:28:01
$1337 because hax
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:47:01
"Back in my day, bitcoin was $10,000 a pop..."
"What are dollars...?"
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:15:42
damn you're a good guy, OP
