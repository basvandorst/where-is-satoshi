The value of one btc is whatever someone is willing to pay you for it, which is the current price. Trying to look into the future is guesswork for anyone, but my guess is that it will continue to increase against the dollar with huge gains and huge dips along the way. I guess that early next decade you’ll be able to buy a house outright with 1 btc.

If shooting your own citizens dead as they desperately try to escape over the border is what you call progress then I guess you are right, the USA did tend to hamper the kind of regimes who would do that.

Eth has no upper coin limit, so if you buy one you don’t know whether it is ultimately going to be one of 100 million or one of 100 billion. That doesn’t undermine its usefulness but it undermines its value.

Bitcoin is more like gold than cash. It’s a finite digital asset which can be divided and securely sent quickly to anyone anywhere in the world with no middle man for almost nothing but cannot be copy and pasted, counterfeited or stolen.

Bitcoin could be updated to a level of security that would take a quantum computer millions of years to crack.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:20:14
I think the number of traders who want to bet on bitcoin is far smaller than the number of everyday people who want to actually invest in it and hold it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:23:35
So for every bet that it’s going to go down there must be someone on the other side of the trade who thinks it will go up.
I still don’t see how they can actually short it and cause large numbers of people who have no involvement with the markets at all to actually sell up by having silly bets with each other like this.
Any crashes will happen in exactly the same way they always did previously, with a bigger rise again afterwards.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:36:13
A quantum computer could break the cryptography that bitcoin uses in less than the 10 minutes it takes to mine a new block.
So someone could hack the blockchain and steal as many coins as they wanted.
I’m sure there are ways that the developers could prevent this happening though, as long as they had enough time to prepare for it without screwing up the way it currently works.

Gold can’t be easily divided and sent to anyone anywhere almost instantly though, and it’s bloody heavy.
Bitcoin can’t be stolen without the key, and the key can’t be stolen unless you fail to secure it properly.
Why is it better than all the other coins, it’s not.
The reason it’s worth more is because more people want it. The reason more people want it is because it’s worth more.

Yeah, and a reduced risk for miners will more often than not take a small chunk of their profit and hand it to those who went long. You pay to reduce your risk of exposure, that’s how it works.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:41:10
I get that, but everyone is saying that they are going to short bitcoin. That means artificially driving down the price, doesn’t it? To do that, you have to either increase supply or reduce demand. Demand is currently relentless, and they can’t increase the supply if they don’t actually hold a lot of coins to dump, so how can they possibly short it?
Sorry if I’m being really stupid here.
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:51:04
Nonsense. The west implemented any aspects of socialism which could be made to work: pensions, social housing, nationalised healthcare, trade unionism etc etc.
The Soviet Union had a lot going for it, but literally drove itself into the ground by stretching itself ever more desperately trying to get one over on the adversary without paying enough attention to its own internal functions.
Before that in the 1960s China decided that more internal reform and a more pragmatic relationship with the west was needed and in the following decades they had a bit of a divergence. The rest is history.

@_date: 2017-12-16 08:57:23
I don’t think it will increase by that much until the new supply of coins is much less than it is now, maybe two or three block halving events down the line.
Bitcoin is quite happy right with the daily injection of 50 million usd but I can’t see how it could sustain billions added every day, just not enough buyers to keep snapping them up that quickly.
Happy to be proved wrong though!
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:47:47
I think he is right that institutional demand is vastly overestimated, and also don’t doubt that it could very easily fall to $7000 in the short term.
However, zoom out and look at the bigger picture.
Bitcoin is pure evolving mathematics. There is no human construct which can do anything more efficiently than a 1 or a 0. That concept will ensure that bitcoin will always win in the end. The only thing that can stop it is redundancy by a better system which I can’t see happening before the age of quantum computing.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:17:04
Much of bitcoin history has been a complete shitshow, that’s part of what makes it so compelling IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:30:08
How does that even affect the price of bitcoin at all then, if none are actually bought?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:48:55
I see, so it’s just gambling fiat money and cannot actually influence the price of bitcoin at all if nobody who owns bitcoin pays any attention to the futures market?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:50:57
That reinforces my point, as it means that if you try to short it then it rises by a lot then your losses on the futures will outweigh your gains from the increased value of the coins themselves.
If it goes from 15k to 25k you might only be able to get it back down to 20k, and you’re facing a big loss, especially if your position was leveraged.

One thing to remember, at current prices the supply of new bitcoins is adding $50million to the market cap every day.
In order to reach 1 million usd in the next 3 years it would have to be able to sustain a DAILY injection of 3.6 billion usd to the market cap.
I think we’re looking at some time after the next halving event and mass adoption alongside collapsing fiat currency before that would be possible.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:56:00
In that case they would have to buy a lot to start with, causing the price to rise, and more publicity, more newbies buying 0.1 to hodl, and no guarantee that the crash would fall as low as they bought in at. Still seems risky to me.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:48:09
I wasn’t worried during the recent crash, I was just watching my net worth go down like “woooooow, this shit is crashing hard, hahahahaha omg! Oh well it will be back.”
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:20:35
I don’t disagree with that. ��
I think that going short on the futures is more risky though because of this. If your futures position is leveraged then there is more money at stake in the futures contract than in the asset itself. Therefore if you go long on the futures then you can buy a shit ton of btc to bump up the price if you really need to. This is only limited to how deep your pockets are. However if you need to sell btc in order to win on the futures then you can only sell what you had already acquired beforehand.
Bulls will win every time until the market cap is an order of magnitude higher.

USSR was not forced to take the actions they did, they took those actions because of the extreme paranoia of one man, Josef Stalin, in the late 1940s.
During those post war years there was absolutely zero desire anywhere in the west for any kind of antagonism towards the Soviet Union. We gave them the design of the jet engine as a good will gesture and tried many times to collaborate on the rebuilding of Europe, but he wasn’t having any of it, he wanted to be number one superpower and that was that. By the time of his death in the early 1950s he’d copied the nukes that we’d invented when we were allies with him and developed rockets with the nazi scientists he’d kidnapped, and the course of history was pretty much set by then.

Drug dealers and cyber criminals etc will be cashing out in anticipation of it becoming more difficult to do so, which will keep supply of coins high and prices low for a while, then as regulation takes hold legitimacy will increase driving more demand from people looking for a legitimate way to store their wealth and prices will start shooting up again.

Not sure about android but iOS is a very secure system with hardware protection built in to the cpu which keeps the keys protected on the device so no other app can see it. Even if you went on a dodgy porn site with malicious code that was running in your browser it still wouldn’t be able to see the private keys of another app.
If you were running jailbreak on iOS then it would surely be more risky but I don’t know a lot about that as I don’t use it.
I’m pretty sure it’s almost impossible to randomly guess someone else’s 12 word seed. All you have to do is keep it protected yourself.
Other than that the only risk I can see is if the developers turn bad and release an update for the wallet which steals your keys.

The irony is I think bcash actually sounds better than Bitcoin Cash. It’s more catchy. You wouldn’t hear a shopkeeper here in the uk say: that will be twelve great British pound sterling please.

If you look at the charts on GDAX you can see the volume of buy and sell orders currently in play.
If you were a whale looking to dump a large amount at once you wouldn’t put a sell order in, you would just sell.

I think what you are seeing as “bad” is just the end of the period when they are very very good, and returning to an overall neutral effect.
However, I think futures will also act as a stepping stone to ETFs which would be a new level of very very good.

I think our understanding of it now is probably like someone from the year 1800 trying to understand a computer. I think we just have to live in our own age and play the games that are in front of us right now. It’s cool to try and imagine though. ��

The more short term damage it gets, the more long term resilience it builds, that’s just the way it is. Nobody can kill it.

Yeah that’s not what happened at all.
I’m from Western Europe and my wife is from the former Soviet Union, it doesn’t appear that you have much understanding about either, sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:31:10
This is like two cars racing side by side, one driver is always looking sideways to the other one.
The Soviet Union would have survived if it had stopped obsessing about keeping up with the west and just chilled out and done its own thing.
Likewise bcash could carve out its own space in the crypto sphere but trying to hijack bitcoin will cripple it eventually. Sad.

I’m using it as a savings account, that’s a use. It’s natural to be talking about the value of your savings if it keeps increasing by itself. ��

Exactly. It doesn’t matter why people want it, the fact is they want it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:09:27
It wouldn’t have been taken down though would it? It would still be bitcoin, just with bigger blocks.
Bcash IS bitcoin right up until August this year. The first block of bcash is the block which Satoshi mined in 2009, the first transaction on their blockchain is the one to Hal Finney. If btc had died and everyone had switched to bch then the exchanges would have probably called that one btc and the newbies and the mass media wouldn’t know any different.
Whatever the outcome of the fork, bitcoin always has and always will survive in the form which suits it best.
It’s survival of the fittest and every time over and over again it adapts in the way it has to in order to survive any challenge that anyone has ever thrown at it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:15:21
Sell it then decide not to buy it back, ever.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:53:47
So the price is going to go up/down/stay the same in a far more or less volatile manner. Thanks for clearing that up. ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:34:30
So the futures will always be higher than spot price until demand runs out, would that be a fair assumption?
And then when a crash happens futures would be higher than the expected level of support?
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:24:03
I used to send money through western union regularly (UK) and they blocked my card every time, until I called them to confirm it then I had to send it again. This is not unique to bitcoin, it’s just because the bank often has to pay out if a customers account is compromised so they are cautious.
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:04:43
It would change the way finance works completely. I’m not convinced that it can replace the usd without a complete meltdown happening first. The only opportunity for it to rise is out of the ashes of the current system after a cataclysmic collapse.

Apparently he was a good match for writing style analytics in the white paper, until they analysed the emails that Satoshi sent to him which he still had, and those emails which he received were a much stronger match than he was, so I’m half inclined to believe him based on that.

I predict a major resistance point at 10k which will hover around there for a while, eventually smash through and go up over 25k, then fall back to mid teens by the end of next year, and then start rising again.

It’s not wrong if the coins were lost forever IMO. If it belongs to someone who holds the key for it then it’s simply stealing.

I think BTC would survive the things you describe above because the difficulty would increase in line with the ability to discover blocks. I would imagine that the majority of the world leading economies making it illegal and locking people up for using it, or the invention of a better idea that makes it redundant are the biggest potential threats.

If banks create their own crypto then it will be no different than just storing fiat money with them. The whole concept of bitcoin is that there is no bank.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:39:27
If you store it on Coinbase then you don’t get the key. That means if Coinbase gets hacked or if they have a rogue employee then your bitcoins could be stolen. My advice would be to use a wallet such as Bread on your phone as that gives you full control of your key. Write down the seed (12 words) and keep them in a very safe place and use all the security measures of your phone and Bread to protect your key. Don’t log in to it on public unsecured wifi or anything.

@_date: 2017-11-29 11:18:31
If you’re talking about how bitcoin works - Imagine a huge safe with loads of compartments in it. The walls are made of glass so everyone can see everything and are as thick as the distance from Earth to Jupiter. That’s also the length of the key to unlock each compartment so pretty hard to pick that lock. There are 21 million coins distributed between the compartments, and with your key to your compartment, you can send the coins to another one once everyone else has confirmed that your key fits into the lock and it turns. Moral of the story, look after your key!
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:12:45
Not exactly. Millions of coins are thought to be lost forever so it’s probably more like 12 million or something at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:59:17
The collection of tax on financial transactions would be a thing of the past. The only thing they could collect tax on is by providing services, such as nationalising the electricity grid, charging a fortune to everyone who uses electricity, and funding public services that way. Same with food, water, fuel, transport, etc etc

Miners also receive a small fee for verifying transactions so once all coins have been mined this would be the full incentive from there on.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:58:13
Yes you are right, but if you are talking about larger amounts then a hardware wallet is the best, that’s what I’ll be doing, with only a little bit kept in Bread.
