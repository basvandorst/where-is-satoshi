converting to alt coins is realizing capital gains lol
@_date: 2014-05-18 04:41:04
why dont u just write code to make better human brain that runs on LOGIC instead of simple childlike emotions or w/e. That would b good for bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-03 04:56:24
bruh im pretty sure bitcoin destroyed the image of bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-24 04:12:39
It's actually a pretty good store of value because it's massively liquid. An asset does not need to appreciate to be a store of value.

this guy hasnt earned the right to use a middle initial like that. gimme a break
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:09:51
Yes! More passive aggressive posts on r/bitcoin! That will show the doubters!
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:34:59
because bitcoin is a harebrained get rich quick scheme and dogecoin is actually cool + fun

For the wages of FUD is death; but the gift of Satoshi is eternal transactions through Bitcoin our Network.

welcome to r/bitcoin, where scams are promoted and protected up until the point where they are revealed as scams, at which point its your own damn fault you fucking moron
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:18:56
Yeah show them that it's a legitimate currency by never actually using it as a currency.
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:51:26
and that my friends is how we abolished slavery. no wait...
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:02:32
serious question, is there any incentive for them NOT to scam? i mean they're literally selling you machines that make 'money' out of electrons.
@_date: 2014-06-24 04:34:37
Yes, because simply sitting on money and never spending or investing it contributes nothing to economic growth.
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:04:28
no wait thats how women got voting rights. no wait...
@_date: 2014-03-26 06:02:06
its the natural reaction to fud (facts u dislike)
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:32:39
because those 99 ppl are idiot sheeple who will never inherit the kingdom of bitcoin. amen
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:44:50
no let them be willfully ignorant its funnier that way
@_date: 2014-03-19 20:42:43
Where does this business get its funding? They seem to take actual money for bitcoins but where is the actual money coming from? It would be really hard for them to sell their bitcoins for actual money on any public exchange since they all have the market depth of a kiddie pool. If it's all through private investors they must be praying for their bitcoins to appreciate and an exchange actually capable of handling large transactions, which seems a little risky to me.

anti money laundering regulations have nothing to do with the irs taxing capital gains on a wildly speculative investment. get a grip guys
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:10:44
Barter dollars or trade dollars are identical to real dollars for tax reporting purposes. If you conduct any direct barter – barter for another’s products or services – you must report the fair market value of the products or services you received on your tax return.
downvote me coiners
@_date: 2014-06-24 02:19:47
That's it, the US dollar is dead. It hasn't budged from $1 per $1 since we went off the gold standard to better manage times of economic crisis. What an embarrassing world reserve currency.
@_date: 2014-05-17 06:17:29
bitcoin's market cap has halved in 6 months. maybe market cap stats aren't all they hyped up to be especially when trade volume is so low
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:44:59
Correction: It's a major strength for people who want to take your money but terrible for consumers. While you may disagree, most people prefer having some form of recourse when someone steals from them.

Are you sure? He's talking about 'returns' and 'profit', things not normally associated with functional currencies.

Growth doesn't come from just the quantity of resources available but getting more productivity out of the resources we do have and ensuring that those resources are allocated efficiently.
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:54:55
are you buying or are you telling other ppl to buy so you can sell higher Lol
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:27:18
The ones who control the most gigahashes?
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:04:57
paypal is the one transmitting money in that case. they have a money transmitter license. they are the ones handling the actual transfer of funds between bank accounts. similarly, if you own and operate a bitcoin exchange you are responsible for transferring funds (usd) between bank accounts. you need a money transmitter license to do that. if you buy or sell bitcoin at a bitcoin exchange you are not a money transmitter. you do not need a money transmitter license to do that. the fact that bitcoin is taxed as property has nothing at all to do with the concept of a money transmitter. hth

I don't think you understand what an 'agent' is.

This is easily the best comment I've seen on this subreddit.

No worries, it's a great time to invest in falling knives!
