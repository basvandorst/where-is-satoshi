neutron absorption?

Increased merchant adoption also adds more credibility to BTC as a currency. Some people who would have otherwise not purchased coins now do, they spend some and keep a little extra just incase this whole thing takes off. Some merchants hold a portion of the coins. Some people spend "horizontally" meaning the replenish their supply whenever making a BTC purchase. Some people spend when they would otherwise be hoarding and don't rebuy. There isn't anyway to know the overall effects of merchant adoption but in the end mainstream adoption is unlikely to happen without merchants accepting BTC so it is a positive for the ecosystem.

one word, **remittance**, that several hundred billion dollar slice of pie is enough to stabilize the market.  No need to worry about "charge back" when you're sending money to family members. Stabilize the market and everything else falls in line.  Not saying its going to happen to BTC but cryptocurrency is a superior technology for moving money and its foolish to think that some form of it won't replace the traditional system sooner or later. Also from the paypal website the lowest fee's for receiving in the US is 2.9% if you're doing over 100K per month. I wouldn't say I'm sorely mistaken.  In addition why single out large retailers? You realize that small business accounts for billions of dollars a year as well right? The average CC fee is 2.5-3% for merchants. If that can be reduced to %1 I have a sneaking suspicion that merchants will jump at the chance to lower their overhead. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 10:35:36
You don't see any added value in a system that could save [over 200 billion dollars]( in fees? You don't see any added value in a system that solves one of the most challenging computer science problems of the last few decades?  A system that allows for unique digital files that could be used for a plethora of applications such as smart property and contracts, voting systems, efficient crowd funding platforms, unique digital art/music etc.  You don't see the value added in a system that is trust less for the user and cheaper for the merchant? You don't see the added value in the system that can send value around the globe regardless of boarders, faster and for pennies on the dollar compared to traditional wire transfers? I'm not saying BTC is the end all be all, it may be supplanted by a better iteration of the blockchain for sure, but to say it has no added value because its "just internet+money" is a bit short sighted.

Making up numbers is fun but so is actually taking the 30 seconds to google that shit.  [Flooz took 35-50 million]( Adjusted for inflation that's 56 million. [Beenz took less than 100 million](   Adjusted for inflation that's 140 million.  Total 196.  2013 saw over 100 million of bitcoin VC and 2014 has already seen 120 million.

Considering the point was to not have a cell phone, immediately pulling the BTC off the receipt might be tricky. The thing to do is print double wallets, one empty one full. They withdraw the full amount and deposit the change to your second wallet for which only you have the private key

@_date: 2014-12-03 12:54:54
I don't think the value could hit that in a decade but as to your point 


If BTC value shot up that high the system will be much more closed looped than it currently is.  If everyone is clamoring to get BTC, that includes merchants and their suppliers and so on.  The "little man" might exercise some of his new found purchasing power but that doesn't mean by definition that price would decrease.

That sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation to me. Imagine though if you could push a device small enough that people don't mind going below the cost of power.

Do you have a source for this because my math is saying you are incorect.  [This]( source puts average player gold at 302,593 per player.  [This]( tells me there are 7.8 million players. The best exchange rate [here]( is $32.75/50k gold or 0.00065$/gold.  Running the numbers You get 7.8M players * 302,593 gold/player * 0.00065 $/gold = 1,533,872,730 USD.

no the third party would control your coins.  You deposit them with Paypal and when the restaurant gets a transaction from a paypal verified wallet address they know you're good to go.

The drop in BTC value is **added on top of your losses** not instead of them.  You had 16 BTC, worth $10,400.  Had you held it you would be worth $7,800.  Instead you have 10.5 BTC worth $5,100.  You lost more not less.


Peta is not adding any new hardware and difficulty is about to take its [biggest jump in months]( while simultaneously taking a large price drop.  That price drop means Peta has to sell more coins in order to get the same amount of money to pay the power bills. Peta shares are worth what dividends they pay and those dividends are dropping like a rock.
Edit- here I did a little math for you.  Peta's farm is 1150 TH/s [Source](  Before this difficulty increase they should have been making about 30 coins a day and after the rise it will be about 25  [Source](  So that's a 17% decrease in available coins to split up.  In adition their power bills are about $5,000 a day(this number is found be multiplying the total hash rate by their stated hosting fee [here]( ). So now the problem is that a few weeks ago they only needed to sell about 8 coins to pay their electric bill but now because BTC value has gone down they will have to sell over 10 just to keep the lights on. So over the next few days the number of btc to split up is going to go from around 30 to around 23.  So your dividends will drop roughly 24%.  When the dividend drops the value of the share drops with it.

any non asic hardware is useless mining BTC.  Look for a cpu based coin, mine that, and trade it for BTC if you really want to mine.

Or possibly a system where instead of the developer %7 premine there could be a fixed value developer fee that is a minuscule percentage of total market cap to be paid yearly.  Then you make next to nothing for the actual work of development unless the market cap becomes particularly large in which case that nets you a salary.  If it becomes a globally used system of commerce sharing a significant percentage of Global GDP then you get paid handsomely, if it flops then you and the developers do not come out ahead.  You would still be capable of investing your own money and the ether you purchased with that would be liquid for you to do as you pleased.  If you consider this project to be revolutionary then investing your own money at the IPO would be a no brainer and you can net gains on that just like the rest of us
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:52:48
The last statement you've made is at best, pretty misleading. If I make a coin with a purported .1 coins produced per year for the next 100,000,000,000 years and premine 50 myself, then I can say "I will never own .000001% of all the coins that will exist" but my statement is utter nonsense.  I'm not accusing you of anything mind you i'm just pointing out the absurdity of claiming a percentage of something that has an undefined end. I don't know the exact numbers as to what your stake would be as the years progress and certainly if you play the major role in implementing a global system as impactful as has been claimed to be then obviously you should be handsomely rewarded.  The difference here is people don't think you or any small group should own a significant percentage of the wealth of the entire globe even if that share decreases over time

Sure a program could turn a small mistake into a big one but this requires the cold storage wallets be withdrawn from automatically, ie not cold storage at all.  It also includes "one guy" never taking the time to balance the books even at a pure glance. Also who on earth would write a program to not even generate some sort of message of "withdraw from cold wallet to hot wallet" every time it happened.  Also It's been said that Japanese regulators were doing monthly audits of Gox how was it not caught then? Whether its a small group or one guy I just can not imagine the vast amount of stupidity this would take.  I'm not saying it didn't happen and I have no way to assume what did.  At the end of the day though I think believing this "wallet leak" story isn't any more or less rational than, key left, losing the keys, or government seizure at this point.  Nothing makes sense in this.

If a rational argument as to why your eggs would be an improvement upon the current system could be made, then I would consider investing in them as well.

Because the thing is that even if developers owning large shares are a neccessity as you claim they still have a negative connotation from the outside and that could be the make or break factor in early addoption.  The problem is there are two scenarios here that can play out.  The first being Ethereum takes off and all the investors, early miners and adopters do very well monetarily. No one who is considering investing has a problem with that scenario.  The second ethereum fails and the developers sell their stake after a year netting them a positive gain, probably a good couple hundred thousand anyway.  This scenario is the problem.  Myself and a group of investors pay our money and a year later its gone and the 4 of you are richer.  This screams scam even if its not your intention or unavoidable as you say.  If you want more trust push your cashout period to 5 years(less maybe .1 percent to cover your living costs and the like)  You then have all the incentive in the world to make the system work and I would be much more comfortable with a 7% developer premine.  If this works you will be fabulously wealthy and good on you for that but if it doesn't you shouldn't get wealthier than you are now at the expense of your investors.

Here's what we've got.  You say no market.  I say here is your market.  You say other options to facilitate that need. My point to yours is people will gravitate to the cheaper option. You ignore what is easily the biggest part of the pie, money transfer.  Remittance alone was over [half a trillion]( in 2012. %10 of the money transfer market would be enough to smooth out those large value swings. At that point you lose the "people won't use it because of huge swings" argument.

you are certainly right.  However I will say that 15 million dollar figure makes no freaking sense. There are 3600 coins mined per day.  That means forbes is proposing that every day miners spend 15 million dollars to get 2.1 million dollars of currency.  Also consider additional overheads other than power (hardware costs, the cost of your building etc) and again this just makes no sense.  Who in their right mind would do this?  It would mean for every dollar the miner spends he gets back 14 cents. I'm not saying some miners aren't operating at a loss I'm just saying anyone who was getting that terrible of a ROI would stop mining.

Yeah there are conflicting numbers, coindesk says [here]( 2013 saw approximately 100 million of VC and [here]( they say the 88 million figure.  Regardless the more recent link still has total VC over 200 million so more then flooz and beenz combined.  I could also make the argument that the miners investments would be classified as venture capital and considering the electricity is at least 10 million a day I would say that money invested in so bitcoin is far and away greater than the two flops you mentioned combined.

The problem would be that when company X accepts BTC they would have to hold it until it is time to pay their employee or vendor.  This would expose them to a risk otherwise not present in their business model and would introduce a difficult bit of tax obligations (capital gains and such).  I'm sure some companies could be convinced to take on that risk and extra work however at present volatility and ambiguous tax status converting directly to fiat is still a much more practical option for most business'.
@_date: 2014-06-06 19:42:12


This is the problem with his calculations.  The amount of money spent on mining is going to chase the amount of money produced from it.  Plain and simple. Right now miners are making between [2-3 million dollars worth a day]( but if the price suddenly shot up to 6600 then 20-30 million a day is being created, it won't be long before that's what is being spent in power so what if the price was 60k like some say we are headed towards.  That's 200 million dollars a day in electricity or 72 billion a year. Orders of magnitude higher than gold mining.
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:53:24

If I'm spending $1500 a day on power and getting $200 in Bitcoin why wouldn't I just spend that money at coinbase and get $1500 of BTC a day? You then get a larger ticket to the 'million dollar bitcoin" party.

@_date: 2014-02-20 13:09:23
The authors idea of competition makes absolutely no sense in regards to a currency. If I have a choice between two identical cars and one is half the price then of course I buy the cheaper one.  If I have a choice between to identical currencies that are equally accepted and share the same utility the "price" of each doesn't matter because I retain the same purchasing power, I've exchanged a currency not bought a product.  IMO the difference that will set BTC above its competitors will be the infrastructure behind it. Will people entrust the bookkeeping of their lively hoods to a massive network of purpose built computers or hobbyists running video cards in their spare rooms?

Nope you misread it.  Then you ignored the more recent article with the +200 million figure.  Also I'm not sure how individuals who venture their capital to invest in mining hardware and facilities upkeep is stupid or wrong to be called venture capital but whatever that's an opinion.  As far as being dishonest I said the argument could be made not "BTC venture capital at 200 million plus 10 million a day", that would be dishonest.  Further more your original statement was name one shitty product and its had more VC than bitcion.  When I disagreed you named *TWO* combined.  When I rebutted with sources you ignored my more recent source and went with the lowest number to suit your bias.

So I can't find what processors their servers use but [xkcd]( thinks they have between 1.8 and 2.4 million servers. So even if they had the best bitcoin mining CPU, the [4x Opteron 6174]( then the would only have 2 million times 115MH which is 230TH.  So all of googles 2 million servers combined could make about [$5200]( a day or 8.59 bitcoins.  If anyone can find the information on what kind of GPU's they have or the number let me know but the best bitcoin mining GPU I see is a 7970 and that can do 825 MH/s.  So if you wanted 51% of network hashrate of even [100PH]( you would need a total of 1.2 billion 7970's.  Thats a 250 watt card so if you had 1.2 billion of them you are looking at  300,000 MW of power. If you are paying 12 c per KW it would cost you **864,000,000 dollars a day** to run these cards.
TLDR; don't worry about google "repurposing some of their hardware" to break bitcoin unless you think they would waste 864 million dollars a day to do it.

the fiat isn't supposed to come from the exchange its supposed to come from people who wish to buy. If everyone who has coins on an exchange decides to sell all at once the price drops hard.  If no one on an exchange wishes to sell at a given time the price drives up until someone does.  The money is not supposed to come from or go to Mtgox or any other exchange.  Properly executed Gox or any other exchange exists to facilitate the meeting and exchange of buyers (people with fiat) and sellers (people with bitcoin) they take a small percentage of that transaction every time and that's how they make money.  If bitcoin goes up to $10,000 on cryptsy, cryptsy doesn't owe me that money that money comes from someone willing to pay me for my bitcoin.

I'm sayin both. The transference of value is a necessary evil at this point to protect against volatility. I only have a few thousand dollars liquid at any time and a certainly don't want to watch my net worth halve or worse. Once adoption is more widespread value changes will not be nearly as rapid and people can see it as something worth holding. It's kind of a chicken and egg thing. Stability will come in time, and that let's you keep your money in crypto but for the time being we need to focus on volume because volume draws merchants. Bitcoin is a more efficient means of money transfer so eventually merchancts will offer discounts to pay in BTC and that's when even the naysayers will join the party, when they can save a buck.

Just a thought but if an appreciable percent of transactions are happening with BTC, behind the scenes or not, the value of BTC would explode and therefore be huge news.  If that happens to occur I bet 10% of people would have heard about the fact that they are using BTC even if its behind the scenes.  It would be like polling people and asking them if they had used HTTP in the last month, I bet it would be over 10%

What are you talking about?  Everyone here who is invested obviously thinks it will go up, with or without the help of "horizontal spending". That's the majority of bitcoin users at present.  I recognize the benefits that virtual currency can offer. I can preform the simple math needed to realize that if BTC is adopted as a global means of value transfer and storage then is price will increase significantly. That's why I own some, because if BTC becomes a staple of the global economy I will own my stake and greatly increase my purchasing power over the initial investment. 
 Also what is implausible about increasing the amount of commerce  in the bitcoin economy as a means of drawing further merchant adoption?  There are plenty of criticisms to be levied against BTC at its current stage but I don't think a push to spend more BTC is something that should make that list.

If you're in the US I would recommend coinbase. I use it and am quite fond of them. I opened a separate bank account with a local credit union, linked my coinbase account to it and bought coins all in an afternoon. The fee is %1 plus a few cents for your bank.  I would recommend after you get your coins you transfer then to cold storage rather than leave then on coinbase.

Ok I walk into a restaurant order and eat a meal.  I pay with BTC. I am using a modified wallet application that automatically double spends money to another wallet address I control.  If I leave before anyone realizes I've double spent, I win.  If the merchant catches me before I go it would be treated like a CC being declined, "I'm sorry sir your TX didn't go through would you like to try again" not "FREEZE MOTHER FUCKER SWATS ON THE WAY YOU DOUBLE SPENDING DOUCHEBAG".  If its a race attack and by chance the TX to my wallet doesn't go through then so be it, I've paid for my meal, I'm out a few bucks and no one is the wiser. I don't see the large associated risk or cost here, so what am I missing? I just want to note that this is me asking if any of this is correct not telling, I do not know the logistics of this one bit it just seems that the dismissive "read the wiki" answers are all I get and I have and not being particularly tech savvy I am unsatisfied.

This is just not true.  The price two weeks ago was [.002680 per share]( if you had spent 16 BTC you would have gained 5970 shares.  Lets round to 6000. So the following days your profits were 
* 8/3  dividend was .00002107/unit so profit was .12642
* 8/4  dividend was .00001467/unit so profit was .08802
* 8/5  dividend was .00001500/unit so profit was .09
* 8/6  dividend was .00001158/unit so profit was .06948
* 8/7  dividend was .00001357/unit so profit was .08142
* 8/8  dividend was .00001366/unit so profit was .08196
* 8/9  dividend was .00001145/unit so profit was .0687
* 8/10  dividend was .00001294/unit so profit was .07764
* 8/11  dividend was .00001244/unit so profit was .07464
* 8/12  dividend was .00001698/unit so profit was .10188
* 8/13  dividend was .00001195/unit so profit was .0717
* 8/14  dividend was .00000924/unit so profit was .05544
This is a total of .9863 Bitcoins of dividends, meanwhile your original investment of 16 BTC for 6000 shares is now worth .00160106/share meaning you have 9.60636 BTC worth of PETA shares for a grand total of 10.59266 Bitcoins.  So your two week investment has netted you a whoping -5.40734 bitcoins or about negative 2700 bucks.  Nice.

there will be 21 TRILLION satoshi (a denomination of bitcoin if you are unaware) if this number becomes inadequate the protocol can be updated to facilitate further divisions. The point being they can be divided infinitely. You are correct that trillions of alt coin units will be created and in fact they probably already have been.  However you are getting hung up on "supply" in an area that doesn't matter.  I can create nh3mechanicoins with 100 trillion units to be issued but if no place accepts them then they have 0 utility and I have therefore done nothing to dilute the demand for Bitcoins. Cryptocurrency isn't a product you buy and keep its a utility you use for goods a services. True that a few competing currencies may emerge and split demand in a visa vs mastercard type situation but when people consider transferring wealth to crypto their decision should be based upon a few characteristics, most namely merchant acceptance and security, "supply" or "price" plays no role in the decision.  In these areas Bitcoin far outpaces other cryptocurrencies and IMO is likely to continue to do so.

This problem isn't about what people rationally deduce, its about when faced with a situation such as this an unconscious irrational bias exists. There are plenty of times when your conscious rational knowledge comes up against the irrational unconscious.  If in those situations people are forced to see their bias they might make the right choice.  The problem is that it A) effects their preception of value even if the rational mind wins out and B) will often times happen when no one is around to correct them and because its UNCONSCIOUS they do not correct themselves.

Since a fixed value of coins exist price most certainly does matter.  At $10/mBit the market is far let volatile.

Ok so people are being rough on you and I'm going to give you the benifit of the doubt that you're not a troll. The vast majority of people who purchase Bitcoins currently are speculators. This whole deal carries with it a large inherent risk. However the price at the end of the year could be 4,000 or 4 a BTC. The price at the end of a decade could be 40,000 or .004.  There is a chance that bitcoins might be worth nothing, and a chance they would have orders of magnitude more purchasing power in the future. There will only ever be 21 million of them and if they play any size able role in the number of financial areas they could be applied to then their value will be significantly higher than today. Will this be the case? No one knows. Should you invest more money than you can lose? Absolutely not. Does 5% of your portfolio belong in a high risk high reward category? Sure. Are bitcoins among the highest/most attractive risk vs reward investments available? IDK probably. Make your own decisions on the last bit but don't think for a min $650 is necessarily "too high". I mean some crazy wealthy venture capitalist doesn't think so considering he dropped several millions of dollars around this price point just two days ago. Doesn't mean he's right but he makes a living placing bets like this.

I'm sorry but thats a bit silly.  BTC could replace all the wealth (not just money) on the entire planet and it would still be worth far far less than a billion per coin.  As for if it replaced all money we are talking closer to a million dollar coin, in which case I can certainly conceptualize the difference between 1 and 100 million. One means I could stop saving for retirement the other means I could retire and do pretty much anything I want. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 12:21:58
Nope. As I said before if they convert immediately as most do, then no capital gains or losses have occurred.

when you say wait for the transaction how long are you talking?  Also would it be possible for a larger mining pool to create their own wallet application that facilitated double spends via a finney attack and took say 10% as a transaction fee.  Criminals could use the app to buy things at essentially a 90% discount and less than scrupulous miners would flock to a pool paying %9 of every transaction 
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:00:21
Neither. I have a coin base account attached to my Bank account. At the beginning of the month I buy as much BTC as I need. Up to this point it's been a small amount for target gift cards to do my shopping (thanks to its also about to be $250 for gas and diesel as well). As soon as the BTC comes in it goes right back out insulating me from value changes pretty well. Over the course of the month I spend the gift cards and when they are gone I repeat the process. It's a workaround way to push volume through the system but if everyone did it merchant adoption would go through the roof considering we are talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of commerce a year.

Prohibitively expensive? For merchants that immediately convert to fiat (most of them) it is not any more expensive than it was prior to the announcement. For those that choose to hold they will just need to develop a tracking method for calculation of capital gains/losses, something I would think any half decent accounting department would be capable of doing.

how exactly do you determine the market for bitcoin is very small?  I would say that the porn industry (several billion dollars globally) alone is enough to double the market.  Money transfers are a muiltbillion dollar industry for which bitcoin seems to have an advantage.  Mirco-payments would certainly be another part of the overall market for a crypto-currency.  I can't see the future so I can't say what the market will be but to say there is a "relatively small **potential** market for BTC" is absolutely absurd

If you're not a believer then sell now @ $700 and take it as a $6000 lesson.  If you think you will panic again and sell on another drop this probably isn't the time for you to be owning bitcoins.  The price is volatile and your money will continue to dwindle with your current buy high sell low strategy.

The app would just track views and execute transactions at levels above dust. If it didn't track views accurately people would stop using it and start using one that does

Umm the front page this week has been dominated by Mtgox news that is certainly not pro bitcoin. Last week it was Mtgox and transaction maleability, again not pro bitcoin.

The thing is they didn't "have" that money they "held" that money. The BTC and cash we are talking about was owned by customers and guarded by Gox. They did not make 500 mil in 3 years they misplaced it

Those conversion fee's are still less than the %3-8 that paypal charges for international payments.  Hell on coinbase the first $1,000,000 is free for merchants meaning the process for both buyer and seller is %1 total.  Even after that point it would be 2% aka less than the alternatives.  Also that is today, as more players come into the space competition will drive that price down further meaning its reasonable to think that the entire process could remain at or below a %1 fee. Considering a difference of 2%-7% thats a pretty considerable advantage for BTC to be used for remittances, a 600 Billion dollar market.

My constant deflections, said the dude who started with one statement (tons of VC gets poured shitty products), to the next (look flooz and beenz got more money than BTC), to the next um um um pets.com and Boo.com failed because they had shitty products, to now they had shitty products because they had shitty management but they didn't fail because of their shitty management they failed because of their shitty product. You could have the greatest product in the freaking world and if you sold it for 1/3 what you bought it for you'd go out of business eventually.  At that point alone the product is entirely a moot point. So keep moving the goal posts I guess. Make deflections about my age all you want, you're obviously not too adept at making a sound argument.  At least this way maybe the blind squirrel that is your rationale will find a nut eventually.

But it's a shitty question.  Was there price inflation in gold between 1981-2000? Yes.  Was there between 2000 and 2012? No.  Obviously you question is insufficient.

Sure is. He just said no inflation so I mentioned the monetary inflation we are sure to have.

The argument I have made is that better technologies take the place of lesser ones. Yours is akin to living in the late 1800's asking why would people want to use cars when they could use horses(something many people did).  Cars are dangerous, inefficient, the break and do not heal, you cannot breed a car, they are expensive, the roads are not made for cars, horses don't catch fire or produce noxious fumes. Cars won the day because they are a better technology and it is demonstrable that the same is true of cryptocurrencies relative to the traditional financial system. Your entire premise is the price moves a lot therefore it will never function, my argument is as adoption increases the price will stabilize which will cause adoption to increase and so on an so fourth.  I think the chicken and egg analogy is spot on, because the answer is neither.  Its not a one happens and then the other, its a gradual increase in both scenarios

* No inflation - Except the new 3,600 coins a day
* Decentralization - Except the large mining farms/pools, trading platforms and brokerages
* No/few transaction fees - Volatility can cost you far more than the average CC fees
* store of purchasing power - Unless you tried to store your purchasing power in 2014 because then you lost most of it
* Secure from government sanctions to destroy other currencies - Not secure from large market manipulators though
* Money for the people -except the distribution of that money is overwhelmingly in the hands of few. Also the "money of the people" is being used by under .1% of the human population
* it´s the future (pay with smartphone) -Except the legacy financial system does this as well
* Money of the internet - That's a bit of a stretch considering e-commerce is in the trillions while the total value of all Bitcoins in the world rests under 5 billion
I'm not saying these as a charge against bitcoin.  I recognize that all of these things can change with increased adoption. I just find it disingenuous to claim these as advantages *now* rather than state that these would/could be the advantages in a world that had completely adopted BTC.  Currently there is a very short list of reasons you should own bitcoins, the primary of which is as a speculative bet that these aforementioned benefits will come to pass.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:21:15


The same could have been said about plenty of emerging technologies during their infancy.  This is a useless indictment of a technology as it is most often the case in large technological changes.  We are at adoption levels of where the internet was in 1993.  Then you could have said that people didn't care or were scared of it and your statement would bare just as much weight in relation to future adoption as saying that about Bitcoin today.


How do you know this? We have no idea what forms regulations will take so its impossible to tell how it will effect costs. As far as transfer rates go, those will remain constant despite regulation, so I'm not really getting your point there.
What this really boils down to is a "chicken and egg" argument.  You can't have widespread adoption without stability and you can't have stability without widespread adoption.  From the naysayers perspective it seems laughably impossible. Yet in the same way that chickens and eggs do exist so too could both widespread adoption and stability come about. Small incremental improvements. You have a group of people with a certain tolerance for risk get into the game, this lowers volatility (even if ever so slightly). In turn the people who were on the cusp before with a slightly lower tolerance for risk are now willing to enter a slightly less volatile market. Rinse, repeat.

Gold as a currency has always seen monetary inflation.  Were prices denoted in gold there would have been price inflation from the early 80's until the early 2000's.

Did I state that monetary inflation *guarantees* price inflation?
I wasn't saying anything other than the fact Bitcoin will see significant monetary inflation for several years to come.  However monetary inflation in the neighborhood of %10 seems like something that could very well cause price inflation.
