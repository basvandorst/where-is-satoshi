Here's one with [less napkin](

1. [Who Takes Coin]( and [Bitcoin Yellow Pages]( are some other Bitcoin directory websites
2. The fastest way to buy Bitcoin is with Coinbase. The safest, by far, would be Local Bitcoins
3. Coinbase provides a point of sale system for Android systems. Also see [CoinKite](
4. Word of mouth, putting up physical flyers, creating a venue on Coinmap, etc. Basically advertising, but Bitcoins!
5. Because it's an easy, secure, there are minimal fees, and there are no chargebacks.
6. NYC Bitcoin merchants will [*NOT* be subject to sales taxes]( Now, having said that, you should still check
7. I've never dealt with BitPay. Darn.
8. said [data.com](
9. You should see what kinds of licensing and certification you need, and be organized.

I used [ChunkHost]( for a Minecraft server way back when. If you scroll down, there's a monthly plan. Five dollars a month for 512mb of RAM-- but don't worry, you can download some more with Google Ultron.
