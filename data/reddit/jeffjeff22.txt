Hello Thank you for you response it helped a lot.  Heres where i am at right now
I have my new computer:
I have my trezor
I have my old USB with wallet file
My Next Step I am going to do is:
download electrum plug in trezor and create wallets.
does this sound right so far ?? do i also need to download core ?
after this step is what scares me because i do not know what to do.
Then I go offline with my computer. Then plug my USB stick in with my old wallet file.
I should be able to see my coins at this point ?
I have never sent or received coins on this address. It is synced up to last time I sent 6-7 years ago.
If cannot see cions What if I cannot ? Do i need to download block chain to sync ? do i download with my usb stick in the computer that my coins are on ?
"If you can see ALL of your coins, you will be able to create and sign a transaction that sends those coins to another address (ie. a receive address on your newly setup TREZOR)."
do i do this offline or do i have to go online to create this ? and how do i create this signed transaction.
Is there a way just to send a small amount of coins as a test ?
which way would be the lowest fees of moving 50-100 coins ?
So sorry about all these question I just want to learn as much as possible before I do something stupid and lose them......A small test would be great if that is possible to move a small amount.
I would like to keep my usb with my coins offline as much as possible until they go to my trezor.
