Yea, in the article I linked below it is $200 million over a period of 6 months.  They are buying over the counter and not on exchanges though.

Has it been discredited though?  
@_date: 2014-09-25 12:25:00
$400 will be worth nothing in 10 years at the rate of government printing

Wasn't everybody saying the opposite a few months ago?  That Bitcoin was not spreading because people were just saving it.

Have you made money mining?  It's a rhetorical question.

If Tim Draper had bought $18 million Bitcoins off a BitStamp I am pretty sure it would have pushed the price higher.

Guaranteed to lose money as the hash rate is too high, and the price is too low.  Just buy Bitcoin if you want to make an investment.

I have a 2 TH CoinTerra and about to take it offline as it's breaking even for power costs.  In addition, to the miner supplier being able to rip you off, there is no way it makes sense for any beginner to get into it.

A dividend would be a really cool idea for a Bitcoin ETF, especially if the dividend could be paid in fiat to your brokerage account.  
The investment by the Winklevoss to start the fund is $20 million dollars, so it already has a much better backing than anybody else out there.

Does this mean you can send Bitcoin without having the internet connection yourself?
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:25:58
Ahh okay, so it's the same coins/traders changing hands over and over on the Chinese exchanges?
@_date: 2014-09-13 22:12:32
Says here, that the fiscal date is 12/31.  How could they have a fiscal date, if their ETF is not existing yet?

Are there cafes there? I thought it was just a old castle house that was bought in Bitcoin there.

With which miner are you making money?
There are no "beginner" miners as any miner that is profitable is costing well over $1,000 right now.

You are right that it would be the same if a person sold their Bitcoin and then bought the computer with that cash.
However, most people with a lot of Bitcoins are not looking to sell them and have money go to their bank, because this is considered a taxable event by the law.  You should pay capital gains taxes for whatever money you made by the increase of the Bitcoin price.
It is a lot more likely that early holders of Bitcoin are using a small portion of their Bitcoins to get something like electronics which they would need anyways.
