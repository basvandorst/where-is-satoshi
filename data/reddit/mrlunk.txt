Real bubble not expected till we pass 1000 ;) ghehehe
neh seriously...
I think this is just quirks up and down...
I've had my BTC for 1.5 year now...
And I will hold on...
even if it drops below 10 bucks again ;)
Trust is what the BTC needs ;)

Buying in with a few will stimulate your interest. I speak from expierence ;)
Then you will learn and make decisions for yourself instead of relying on market advice from others ;)

Same position here :)
I bought BTC approx 1.5 years back because I thought it had potential...
Bought 20 BTC at something like 13 to 15 Euro I think...
Making that buy was a stimulus to myself to keep track of what would happen in the future...
Not selling b4 BTC hits 10k$ ghehehe ;)
And will hold on even if it dives under 10$ again (wich it won't ;) )
grtz, PL
