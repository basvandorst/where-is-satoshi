That would make sense then, thank you. Now I know to pay more attention to the exchange rates.

I chose the paypal option, it's the only one that's available to me.

That's really kind of you, thanks :)

Exchange rate of 300 odd pound and on localbitcoins

Mycelium is telling me it's 53 sat/byte

Right, but I've not even had the initial one. That's the point I was trying to get across.

I dont follow this sub nor do I keep up with bitcoin news. Not every poster here is a bitcoin/bit market enthusiast. I was just worried about my money. Hard to believe, right?

Thanks for the info. So I'm guessing even priority would have been slow?

They really put those few extra pennies to good use don't they? Almost 24 hours later and not even 1 confirmation.
 Shouldn't have let curiosity get the better of me.

I thought the same. Apparently there is a huge influx of unconfirmed transactions which is slowing everything down. Some are saying it's an attack on the block chain. 
I've been waiting 35 hours for mine to go through.

But a higher exchange rate than the *current* rate would give me less GBP to spend, right? I'm trying to figure out exactly how much GPB I have.

Thank you! Sorry if I never explained it well enough

I was simply curious as to how long it would actually take. Seems I picked the wrong time with the apparent overload of transactions
