I think it’s only a problem if you cashed them out for fiat. I forgot I even had BTC left in an old wallet - you could use that argument so long as you aren’t actively cashing out / trading for alt coins. More of a don’t ask don’t tell thing. 
If you took profit (I.e. withdrew USD/EU), then of course you’d have to report it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:40:01
What an idiot. Bitcoin cash is a temp solution to the saturated block chain and will be in the same boat as bitcoin in no time. Don’t invest. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:13:16
So if I transferred directly to ETH at a loss (I.e BTC was worth 1k, I transfer to ETH and it’s worth 900), I can claim a loss?  Even though that coin will continue to rise in value in the future?  It’s just if you  profit from the exchange directly, correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:43:39
Dollar cost average next time fam. Spread out that big of a purchase.

Maybe :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:50:33
So you have around .01 of a bitcoin. Most people are thinking around 100k but who knows. Not enough to retire on, that’s for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:01:23
Until I can use BTC as it’s supposed to be used. I’m never selling off all my BTC, but if it hits 100k I’d probably get rid of some to help buy a house. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:02:30
How would paying taxes on trading between coins go?  If I’m holding onto the new coin, how is the value determined? If the coin goes to shit, then I didn’t profit, so how would I pay taxes as if I gained any capital? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:08:22
Dude. Transfer to GDAX first then to your wallet. No fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:22:06
Get your coins the fuck off coinbase and into a private wallet. Anyone that leaves their coins in there to profit is a fool.  
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:03:46
Really? Where’d you send it to? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:40:15
TO THE MOON
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:51:59
Yeah it’s called arbitrage. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:06:47
Right, but who said I’m converting it to fiat? I’m just keeping it as a coin where the price fluctuates each day. No way anyone is keeping a daily tab on what the coin is worth since most of them are so volatile. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:16:58
Thanks for the info, much obliged!

Lol. Keep holding your breath for sub 6k. Not gonna happen. I’d bet on it if you’re interested. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:36:57
Go away dude you’re already invalidated. Over 10k on bithumb and hit 10001 on binance. You’re wrong. 
You were nowhere during the rally and now you’re back spewing your bs. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:45:19

Lmao this dude is back 
@_date: 2018-05-30 22:51:23
What drives the price of any other currency? Certainly there are some FA factosrs, same goes with BTC. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 06:17:03
Same could be said for those calling sub 6k. Nobody knows.

Portfolio 
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:00:05
Honestly, I think 10k is a safe bet. I’d be willing to cash out my initial investment there, and keep my profit in BTC/eth/alts. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:26:56
I don't know why anyone bothers to feed the troll.  Look at his comment history, it's like he responds to EVERY single comment on this thread.  What a pitiful life.  
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:16:15
Coinbase has funding for crypto projects, can’t remember what its under though 
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:16:07
Agree. Look at the indicators. Everything is signaling a reversal. Last time stoch double bounded we went up 3k ina very short amount of time. 
Good news for bulls: there is little to no resistance ahead. Most sellers in 8k are gone, aside from those looking to take some small profits along the way.  Path of least resistance is down. Everyone’s waiting for sub 8k, people will get impatient and we’ll take off. 
Bad news:  we might be trading within this range for a few weeks. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:18:19
Sounds like you need to do some more research my friend.
@_date: 2018-05-14 01:42:51
Someone missed the bottom at 6450 :(  nowhere to be found when we were rallying previously and now he’s back. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 22:43:47
Also FYI it hit 10k on binance, and Bithumb, so you’re wrong :) 
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:13:56
Not as easy as you think with everyone waiting for the dump. We’ll be sideways or up from here for quite some time. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:33:13
? I’m saying keep my profit In crypto and take back my initial investment. I’m almost to the point where profit &gt; initial investment, I think 10k would put me well over that. 
I’m buying a house next month so I’ll need all the fiat I have available. 
@_date: 2019-11-03 17:00:25
Interesting as Bulgaria was one of the few countries I spent BTC at during my time in Europe
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:28:46
Seriously. Dumped ~200 bucks in 20 minutes. This market is fucked.  It’s almost too easy to short the Bart’s. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 13:59:28
Yeah but most people have been onto this trend for awhile, and have been expecting it to do the opposite each time. It hasn’t yet. So, you could say just as many people are thinking the opposite of what is expected is going to happen. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:35:25
God go away, your analysis is invalid already! 
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:23:35
Not sure what you're getting at with the inverse graph, but I'm neither bear nor bull.  
I have a small amount of btc that I bought back in 2016 @ 454, so even if we hit 1k, I'll still be green.  
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:12:54
Don’t bother, this dude called 3k BTC in April and is salty he missed the run up to 10k. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:09:56
Is this a slow bottom? In comparison to decreasing, we haven’t increased much at all in quite some time.  It’s been a straight decline since we did not break 10k. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 04:07:43
I haven’t seen a better example of confirmation bias in quite some time. Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:53:14
You also have some reading to do :)
@_date: 2018-06-17 00:18:48
Anyone believing this is delusional. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:43:09
Huh?  You never said that, you said 10k never again. And we hit 10k. So, yes, you’re invalidated :) better luck next time! 
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:42:26
Where do you see this?  Not showing up on omniexplorer. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 00:33:05
it is?  When did btc hit 3k last month?  As that is what your 'analysis' shows.
edit:  Actually it shows that BTC @ 3k in April, so anyone listening to your analysis would have missed out on almost 60% gains from 6.4-10k.   Better luck next time :)
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:13:27
The price 4 years ago vs now...wow
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:53:42
As I said, you're invalidated.  Better luck next time :)
edit: lmfao he even edited his post from three months ago to now say bitfinex.  RIP
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:42:54
Don’t think this one will bart to be honest. Too predictable. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 04:35:47
Still wrong. 3k BTC in April ������ someone missed the run to 10k. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:18:30
Idk why anyone gives this dude the time of day. His analysis is invalidated. 
If you think BTC is going to 4K, I wanna see screens of 100x leverage or stfu. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:39:53
Yes, you said 10k never again. We hit 10k on binance. Then you added “bitfinex” to fit your agenda. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:13:52
So you’re comparing BTC to gold and the stock market? That sounds positive for crypto :) 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:22:43
Wow thank you!! Mine wasn’t $10 free of bitcoin, it was just $10. Totally forgot about it. Even saw the price i paid for bitcoin when I first got in. $403!
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:32:27
I bought BTC with mine as well, only reason I used circle in the first place. Maybe it was a different promotion. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:53:33
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:08:44
Buy a little bit at a time. Like if you want to buy one bitcoin, split it into 10 purchases of .1 BTC over an interval (like once a week). 
You add the cost of all those purchases together, divide by 10, and that’s the price you paid for your “full bitcoin”.  
Right now, you’d technically be paying more since all it is doing is increasing with very little pullback. But this is an odd case. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:08:18
I made the same mistake around $9500 and moved all my BTH to ETH. I bought in at 5700 so still profiting. 
Didn’t really lose much aside from the fees, but really missing that bitcoin balance. Will be purchasing some more soon, and happy to diversify my funds. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:15:24
Honestly, I don’t have an exact answer for you at this time. I don’t think anyone does. 
I’m sure some people are hoping for a dip so they can buy more, but at the same time, it has been bullish for more than a months time. I invested when it was 5700 mid October, and even then thought I was too late. 
With something so volatile and such uncertainty, I don’t think there is a right answer. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:29:20
I have my coins store on exodus. I like the interface, I’d never leave coins in Coinbase ever again to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:08:12
Good idea - Dollar cost average is a popular approach for things that are volatile like bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:41:51
Spending is taxable? That sounds difficult to control. My one bitcoin is still one bitcoin. They don’t tax me on USD I’m holding that may have appreciated (or depreciated) in value, so how can they tax spending crypto? 
Also, They are tracking how I’m spending my crypto how? I send it through a tumbler to my wallet. Whoops, lost the private key to that wallet so don’t know where that bitcoin went..  I use monero, etc. 
The whole policy is a mess right now, they will never be able to regulate a decentralized currency. Too difficult to keep up with. The more they try, the more loopholes and ways to evade the policies will come into play. 
Ps: I filed taxes and claimed my crypto so I’m doing everything as I should be, just playing devils advocate. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:18:51
BTC isn't a negative sum game.  It's not even a zero-sum game.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:45:56

@_date: 2018-03-09 01:52:40
I don't understand how everyone and their mother is shorting BTC right now.  There is some weird manipulation going on with the market.  We have never seen this many red candles on the daily with so much loss in volume.  Something is up.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:14:21
Serious question: I am very well off financially. I have invested about 1/20th of my annual income into BTC. Do you think it’s stupid to keep it in there right now? 
I’m okay with losing at least 50% of that, with the intention that it will go back up. Do we see bitcoin going to sub 4K honestly? 
I know none of you are financial advisors, but I’m curious how many people are in my situation.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:42:50

@_date: 2018-03-16 13:24:10
I don’t see it hitting that low. Last time, people who bought at 6k were able to DOUBLE their investment in less than a month.  Nobody is going to miss out on that opportunity, so we’ll see buys much before that. I think 7k is the lowest we’ll see. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:32:05

@_date: 2018-03-16 01:53:17
So essentially (if you're trying to evade taxes), by saying you lost your private key to a wallet, you could claim a capital loss?  Not really sure how this works for filing taxes as I've never claimed a loss before. 
I just see this whole regulation as a headache and I'm glad they are taking the time to figure it out.  I truly would love to see a decentralized p2p exchange of crypto.  No need for banks and instant transactions would be amazing - esp for those of us who do a ton of business outside of our residing country.
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:41:54
I've been doing the same since feb.  Scale your buys people!  Put weight on where you think it will get, and dont FOMO!
@_date: 2018-03-01 04:38:10
Then short it with 100x leverage if you are so sure. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:06:35

@_date: 2018-03-28 06:01:02
Me neither. I put 5 figures into crypto last time it dipped to 7300 and I’m holding it all. High risk high reward, be greedy when others are fearful. Sounds like reversal  time for me 
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:07:59

It’s a bot that tracks liquidated shorts / longs for gamblers who margin trade BTC. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:46:46
I think for me, it’s hard to believe that everything will go to shit.  Exchanges, teams, etc. 
Also, Think about all the People in tether/on the sidelines. I know I was until 7500. All these people are just waiting until the right opportunity. Last time it hit 6k, it skyrocketed to almost double your value in less than 2 weeks. Who would want to miss out on that opportunity?  Even if it doesn’t double, and only goes to 8k. Still quite a bit of profit to be made. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 18:53:33
I know polo in the US allows margin trading. I myself have no experience though, so can’t really help you much after the recommendation.  
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:02:47
I disagree, but that’s because I only want to invest what I have and not fear losing it. Even with a 5x a big market move could leave you with nothing. At least I’d still have my coins if they weren’t leveraged. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 15:44:10

@_date: 2018-02-07 20:55:40
use a stop loss and you will have no problem making money.  Don't buy at the top, be patient.  ETH just went from 560-860 in less than 24 hours.  Plenty of money to be made in crypto, just don't get greedy.
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:07:57
I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say. Still using money / BTC that you don’t own to gain more. Responsible gambling is still gambling.

Uh, no? It’s an investment and even if the USD price declines, I still have my BTC. Get liq’d and you’re left with your dick in your hands.  Simple as that.  
Not saying there is anything wrong with gambling, it’s a personal choice for me to not indulge.

Your chart doesn’t show anything. Look at your vertical axis, $100 differences in a volatile asset. It skews your results to show your “point”.
