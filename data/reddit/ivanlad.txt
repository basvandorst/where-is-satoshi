Yeah I understand.
I don't get why people are so butthurt. I literally only said what their website says. Put down your pitchfork please. Don't shoot the messenger.

Yes. That is way safer (financially) than any other option. The only problem with that is now you personal safety becomes a priority. Just be sure you take the proper precautions with that and you should be perfectly fine.

I mean I guess that's true man. 
In a world of what ifs you could always be right
@_date: 2014-08-06 21:46:24
Fair enough

You can purchase food with bitcoins almost anywhere that offers gift cards online. 
We may have to wait a little while for Mortgages though. :p

I don't see why people are so bitter about this. He didn't like the direction Ripple was headed, so he decided to make his own version of it.

I've seen your posts dude. All you do is call people trolls and generally troll back. 
You tried, I'll give it to you.
See you around @_date: 2014-08-06 19:20:21
I understand what a gag order is. But unless they are watching your specific traffic at the exact time you are using the internet it won't be an issue. 
So even if the government came to them and said, "give us all of this persons data" they wouldn't have anything.

It sounds pretty bitter when you call something worthless. 
Not to mention I just saw a post you made about Dogecoin owners being retarded. 
That being said, I understand why you made your comment. But If you take the time to look at it it's a pretty good thing they are doing.
@_date: 2014-09-07 07:12:53
Yes It is.
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:00:09
That's mostly correct. 
However, Just because something is not new and innovative doesn't mean it won't be successful or is retarded. 
Take Microsoft for example. They didn't invent computers, in fact they didn't invent the idea of operating systems. What they did was use an already existing operating system, made a few changes, and released it as their own. Innovation does not equal success.

I have read that article before, back when it happened. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:20:23
Good luck bro
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:31:10
Could be the case. 
@_date: 2014-07-31 18:46:35
This is true. But I believe that you can lock/unlock at any time.
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:24:25
Now I only watched the video that was posted here recently about the service, so I'm not incredibly familiar with it.
I thought that when you unlocked your coins you get coins equal to the dollar amount you locked in at. So it wouldn't matter what the price of btc was really. If that isn't the case, I don't see what the purpose of the whole thing is.
So as long as you would trade your coins as soon as you unlocked them you should be all set. Right?
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:05:00
I in no way shilled anything. 
You are just upset because someone has an opinion than differs from yours.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:30:06
The issue is just stubbornness. You have to expect backlash at something so new. Think of how the internet was viewed when it was invented.

The price of bitcoin in Russia would be higher not lower.
In all of these places where they are "banning" bitcoin the same is true. It just means it is harder to obtain, making it more expensive due to supply/demand
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:04:21
It would drive the price of bitcoin in Russia much higher than it is now that's for sure.

They are located in america, but they have stated on their website that they do not keep any records, and all logs are trashed when your session closes.
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:37:28
I would stay away from local bitcoins if I were you. That place is a shithole. 
Almost every trader there is out to scam you. Whatever you do, don't trade using paypal.
