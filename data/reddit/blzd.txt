They now teach in professional writing classes NOT to do this. So, yeah. It makes you look bad. Typographers have spoken on this.

You must not know what a synonym is... how else do you educate the public? hmm? commercials? pain compliance? what? lol... education is the process of collecting and transmitting factual information to those that don't possess it. It's what a teacher does, it's what a journalist does. Journalists are teachers for adults. Seriously, what alternative are you advocating? Journalism is the only career protected in the bill of rights. Media consolidation is the problem, not journalism. You're damning the whole bunch because of a few bad apples.

Wait, so you need to be a journalist? because educating the public is basically the definition of a journalist...
