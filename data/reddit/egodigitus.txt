The exact same way you generate a Bitcoin address, since it's a fork. But please be careful, don't send funds to a hot wallet that doesn't accept bitcoin or bitcoin cash.

Thanks alot :) was somehow skipping this chapter... didn't seem too relevant, feel guilty now.
Why would Satoshi pick this specific attack vector for discussion in the white paper?

Have any major ASIC manufacturers planned to integrate stratumV2 into their firmware natively?
@_date: 2019-08-09 08:48:59
Doesn't the firmware need to "speak" betterhash as well in order to mine on a betterhash pool?
@_date: 2019-08-08 20:43:45
Do they run antminers or halong miners?

! WARNING ! This will delete your private keys permanently !
You need to delete the bitcoin data directory.
For Mac the default location is
~/Library/Application Support/Bitcoin/
More info: 
If you don't want to delete your private keys (wallet) make a backup of .wallet.dat file

Really like your artworks :)
I've seen "Satoshi roundtable" images, which are protected. What's this about?

Feels like you don't have the right permissions. Try it with "sudo rm -rf /path/to/your/bitcoin/data/directory"
Edit: formatting
@_date: 2019-08-09 09:39:53
Is there any ASIC manufacturer / firmware available that supports betterhash?

Thank you! In order to verify the electrum release, they suggest to run "gpg --verify Electrum-3.3.4.tar.gz.asc". Unfortunately in the official bitcoin core github I can't find any signed binary. Only the release commit itself is "verified" by uploading the pgp key to github. Any suggestion how to verify the release by myself?

Great, thanks :) Was pretty that there is a good solution in place.

The block validation time reduces, because you are able to parallelize transaction validation. At least the independent UTXOs. That's the main reason why BCH changed the order of transactions in their blocks.
In an account based model (standard DB) every tx affects the global state, which is hard to parallelize.

Would you rebroadcast monero blocks? Or is this a Bitcoin only thing?
@_date: 2019-01-16 23:01:59
What kind of data would you're API NOT rebroadcast? Or is it open to ANY kind of data?
