I’m already read and you have to open a Chanel to make a transaction or I’m wrong ? So it’s like prepaying what you think you want to expend in certain amount of time , so if bitcoin goes to 1 million you will need to pay 1000$ to open a Chanel otherwise use ious from custodian services and not owning really bitcoin, and if you want to send to your address you have to pay the fee 14 like rigth now or 1000 whatever the price of bitcoin it’s so at the end LN it’s not solving any problem just making more problem

So what’s the problem I like others coins ? It’s prohibited? Or what ? Why you don’t give me a nice answer about the LN prices to open a Chanel on a future ? Do you see me shilling bcash.? So nobody can have concerns about bitcoin ? Who it’s worse the ones that stay in silence ?

Funny how you plan to buy a 5$ beer with a 20$ fee ? Maybe and only if you doing a expensive party or high price drinks ! Otherwise it’s not viable !
