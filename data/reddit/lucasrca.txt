Don't blame the Bitcoin or other cryptomarkets. Blame yourself. Sorry for your loss, but Bitcoin isn't "luck". 
It's like any other assets. We can get scammed everyday, with tomatoes or fiat.

I'm living on  the north region of the country. The number of people that never heard about Bitcoin is huge.
Unfortunately, when you begin to explain that Bitcoin is a virtual money and you can buy some with fiat money, store by yourself, just using your own PC/laptop, without taxes from banks and finance institutions, they start to think that you're trying to convince them to enter some sort of ponzi scheme.
It's sad. 
Two states of the northeast region are very receptive for Bitcoin, with shops, bookstores, etc.
States of the southeast and south regions are far better if compared to the north and northeast regions. I really don't know how is it on the midwest region, how they're dealing with.
I run two full nodes: one using a personal server and a VPS outside  Brazil, just to keep  the traffic flowing.

Don't forget Brazil.
Corruption, etc... BRL is falling hard.

One last question: electrum or multibit-hd? thanks
@_date: 2017-06-07 14:36:26
Thanks. How can I circumvent this on the next transaction? Higher fees?

What is **on-chain** capacity? What aspects define this capacity? Thanks.
