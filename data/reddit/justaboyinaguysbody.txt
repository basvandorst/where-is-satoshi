the thing about gold is that it has actual uses outside of being strictly valuable.  it's physical properties are what make it valuable and of course, the supply.  Say all but 1 kg of gold is left in the world.  That 1 kg can still be used to make extremely expensive jewelry and it's ability to conduct electricity still makes it useful. Now say only 1 BTC remains in the world...well then it's literally worthless at that point because it's ability to be used as a form of currency is now gone since very few people would be able to have any...

sure, but there will come a point where no bitcoin will be mined anymore...
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:00:13
Yeah exactly...

well if he's withdrawing it now then he isn't hodling...
also isn't the whole idea of hodling to NOT withdraw for USD ?

This is why DCA is such a good strategy.  If you bought at $7500, and then you bought more right now at $6800, then on avergae, you bought at $7150.

so if the exchange has my private keys, then even if I send the BTC to my trezor, the exchange can still take them back since they're always going to know the private key right?
@_date: 2019-12-09 18:18:53
ok thank you.  so as long as I have a balance on my trezor and no one else knows the private key, it's safe in there ?  thank you for your time, sorry for my ignorance.

Gemini is great

I've set my alert for if bitcoin hits $5000.  If this movements results in BTC price drop, I'll be swooping in.

My main concern is that I want to remove my btc from exchanges and put them on my trezor.  But I want to verify that I actually 'own' the BTC that's on the trezor and that it's all there.
@_date: 2019-12-09 17:47:35
Ok, so if I want to remove all my BTC from an exchange and put them on a hardware wallet like Trezor, I just simply withdraw from the exchange and sent to the wallet's address...but in the process, i'd never have to deal with the BTC's private keys right?  And if all you need is a bitcoin's private key in order to send/receive it, why does it need to sit in a wallet in the first place?

if BTC hits $1M USD, then that means the dollar has already lost virtually all of it's buying power anyway and we've already replaced it with something else.
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:08:03
This is how:
21M / 7.7B people =  0.00272727272 bitcoin per person
 0.00272727272 \* 100M Sats =  272727 Sats

why would anyone downvote you for this??
@_date: 2019-09-06 17:35:35
just curious-  why is this a big deal ?  or are people just turning this whole thing into a meme?  If its just going from one wallet to another, thats meaningless unless it's going to an exchange right?  Sorry i'm a bit ignorant here.  just trying to understand what exactly this means
