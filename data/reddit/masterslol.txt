This was gonna be the speculated problem with segwit 2x, because it didn't have replay protection.
 Replay protection means that the coins on the BTC chain can be spent independently of Bcash, and vice versa. 
The problem you have without using replay protection on a blockchain means that your transaction can be maliciously 'copied' on the sister chain and somebody pockets those coins.

Tried to buy some coins at 1:12pm but Lloyd's blocked the payment. Just confirmed with them and was about to try again when I saw the £200 jump. Fuck banks.

Unless the coinbase app on my phone gets its prices from coinfloor I'm not looking at coinfloor. But it did hit it 20 mins ago
