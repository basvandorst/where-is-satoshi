Not if they go through a money laundering site. The idea is that you send bitcoins to one of these sites, they transfer them in random sized amounts between all their internal wallets and spit them out in various random sized amounts to a number of external wallets (all of which you own). 
With enough users using the site it's basically impossible to see what money is going where even if you analyse every single sending path. 
Of course, you'd have to trust the site owners not to run off with your money, but that's a whole new issue.

This was discussed a while ago and basically to be able to double spend after a merchant has received 1 notification of the funds is very very hard to do. You'd need a lot of computing power and it would require a lot of effort and luck. It's basically less risky than someone paying on a credit card and doing a chargeback a day later. 
@_date: 2011-07-09 15:47:38
Yea as a vendor I MUCH prefer Bitcoins over Paypal, just the setting it up is still way too complex for most business owners. For users though there is little point in using Bitcoins over just using a credit card.

An online wallet is an awesome idea, just with so many hacks recently I don't think many people would go for it.

I think the core problem is that it screws with the risk/reward ratio in business / investing. When you are able to gain money by holding onto your cash then most people instinctively try and horde their money. This then means businesses find it harder to sell to people and get less money and collapse, which creates more unemployment etc. 
When money looses it's value over time people want to spend it or invest it because there is little point in holding onto it (it becomes a liability to horde)
Though it is 3am here so maybe that made no sense at all...

Yep I was thinking along these lines too, the recent bubble was just from a few sites talking about how it's gaining in price so rapidly, soon those people will cash out and we'll be back to the real bitcoin lovers who love it for the currency and not just future profits. I think ATM $10 - 15 is pretty realistic range of where it will settle provided there isn't too much more mass media hype then it will continually increase from there. 
@_date: 2011-10-15 06:06:46
This is so awesome! I've always thought the key to Bitcoins success is not in First world countries but developing countries or countries without such a stable economy. 
The main benefits of bitcoin (can't be taken by the government, easily traded without middle men, and are a global currency) are all much bigger benefits for those in the developing world. 
If Kiva got behind this it would be a massive boon for both Bitcoin and Kiva.

I'd say the most likely attack will be by stealth, someone who finds an exploit and manages to generate coins that the network validates without anyone noticing (or finds some way to take more coins than should be allowed for himself sent to random address so no one knows all those coins are going to the same wallet)
@_date: 2011-07-01 17:09:04
Though up until June the price of coins was increasing at about the same rate as difficulty which is why it was always profitable until then. However for the past month the price has remained pretty consistent while the difficulty has shot through the roof.

This app has some great ideas that could be integrated into the Bitcoin Mobile apps. Stuff like being able to sync with Facebook and easily send bitcoins to people by selecting them from your Facebook friends list, or just by entering their email / phone number would be awesome. 
Then it could easily notify that person if they don't yet have a bitcoin wallet linked to their account to create one and get started. 
I'd imagine it'd be run through a company so they can keep a database of emails -&gt; wallet ID's and the app just connects to them to retrieve the related wallet ID and send the money. If the person on the recieving end doesn't have a bitcoin account they'd get an email or sms asking them to either create an online wallet or just link their email / mobile number to the wallet ID. 
I'm trying to think of a way to make it decentralised but not really sure...

Bitcoin isn't a pyramid scheme, however in it's current state it resembles one. Let me explain:
A Pyramid scheme is basically a system where you earn money solely through being one of the first into the system. Generally there is no other value in taking part in the scheme other than to make money from those that come later than you. 
A simple example of this is a system where you have to pay $100 to join a 'group' and then you can begin selling memberships for $100 for this 'group' and the only incentive you have to joining is that you'll earn money recruiting others. 
These schemes always collapse at some point or another, those that get in early win and those that got in late lose. 
The reason why Bitcoin is currently very similar to a pyramid scheme is the vast majority of people buying are not buying because they want goods or services, they are buying because they want to profit off of reselling their Bitcoins in the future, and if everyone does this eventually someone (or a large group of people) will realize, start selling, others sell, currency crashes, and those that just invested lose out big time. 
Once Bitcoin starts becoming more stable and people are buying them in order to buy goods and services, not just as investments, then it is no longer a pyramid scheme and is essentially a normal currency. 
So basically at the moment most are waiting to see if Bitcoin will cross that threshold or crash. 
I believe it's going to cross that threshold because more and more businesses are starting to accept bitcoins, however outsiders don't see this, they just see the rapidly increasing value and immediately assume its going to crash soon. 
@_date: 2011-06-24 15:14:04
It is averaging 10 per hour at the moment, as it has been for the past few days. Basically after the difficulty goes up it goes back down to 6 per hour, then slowly increases as more computers come online until the next difficulty jump then it goes back down to 6 an hour again.

He really nailed it with the 4th paragraph, specifically this:
" I would convert my disposable part to Bitcoin, and use it to buy stuff over the course of the month. When I pay for something in the middle of the month, that means I have got two weeks of Bitcoin appreciation-deflation in my back when buying the geek toys."
This makes complete sense and completely destroys the argument that 'bitcoin is bad because it's deflationary'. As soon as you can buy most of what you normally buy in bitcoin then you might as well convert your earnings each week and just spend them instead of real cash, because anything left over (and all that cash just sitting in your account) will gain value much quicker than it would in USD. 
This is provided the market doesn't crash of course. 
@_date: 2011-06-24 14:09:05
Sort of, the rate of coins being produced will actually go down because currently there are 10.63 coins being produced per hour, while after the difficulty increase there will be 6 coins an hour (until more machines come on and it rises again). 
@_date: 2011-03-02 16:59:27
Exactly what I thought too. What's the point of loaning money to someone if you lose more than doing nothing?
EDIT: Actually if the economy is say deflating at 3% isntead of inflating at 3%, wouldn't it just means loans will be about 6% less than what they are currently and it'll all work out fine? (So you could get a home loan for 2% interest and it would be roughly the same as AUD)

You should have multiple pages one for each card where users can type in their own MH/s on a new row (and can add their flags / speed etc), then it averages all the MH/s together for the main page. That way it'll be more accurate than just the small amount of information in the wiki. 
@_date: 2011-07-11 13:27:52

Hell yes I would sign up to this. Having to keep your own coins secure is one of the biggest things holding Bitcoin back from going mainstream. I'm a huge geek but even I would rather store my Bitcoins with a bank rather than keep my wallet on my PC.  
Because there's always the thought that one day I may get a trojan or get hacked and all my coins could be stolen and there's nothing I can do about it.

The hardest challenge any new crypto currency is going to face is getting traction. It's kind of like trying to be the next hit search engine or social network, people really only need one so it's a massive uphill struggle if there is already an entrenched competitor. 
The only way I can see another crypto currency working is if a massive company (google/apple/microsoft/facebook) gets behind it and massively improves on bitcoin in some way.

Yep true, once bitcoin has been around for a few years and the deflation has leveled off so it's not as crazy as it is currently it'll be all good. 
The real test is if it can last the next few years. Because currently there seems to be a lot of people trying to sell goods in Bitcoins and not that many willing to spend their bitcoins (though that is simply based off what I've seen on Reddit recently).

Honestly I think it'd be better to build some software that helps Bitcoin as a currency rather than as an asset / trading. Perhaps something that can help businesses accept bitcoin easily (that you can then sell to larger companies). Or have you seen the 4 hurdles of bitcoin? ( there are some great ideas in that series.

Maybe if you learned all you know about business from the media. As anyone who as ever run a successful business will tell you 90% of the work is below the surface and once you have a good idea you're about 1% of the way there.

I think you need to read up on what a Pyramid scheme actually is... Whether it is open source or not has nothing to do with it.

@_date: 2011-06-07 13:44:08
I think this is more for getting mainstream adoption. If we want those outside the tech community to take part there should be much better security or we're going to have a lot of mass media hysterica as soon as a few non-techies get their wallets stolen. 
I definitely think the bitcoin client should encrypt the wallet by default and require a password upon starting up, that makes total sense and am amazed it hasn't been done yet.

Though there were quite a few that I didn't expect would be cracked so easily:
Would those have just been brute force? I remember reading that a 6 character rainbow table is ~1Tb in size, and 7 character would be ~60Tb so thought it would be unlikely they'd build a rainbow table for the above, and I thought it'd take a lot longer to brute force.
