Not zero. Some people panic sold when the price drops so they lose money.

I just stopped using Kraken for their withdrawal fees. Some exchanges don't even charge fees.
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:20:23
With the amount of fees they charge for withdrawal, I'm not.

I'm getting tons of ICO emails because my e-mail was in the BitcoinTalk database dump.

They have also been around for a very long time. Slush is one of the very few pools I recognize before the media gave a lot more attention to Bitcoin.

Nah. When I tried closing my account at CIBC, they tried convincing me to sign for a $50 account closing fee even after I told them I wanted to withdraw all my money before closing. 
They gave me all my money after I told then I didn't even sign the form yet. Lol fuck CIBC.

Absolutely not! You'll saturate our method and make Bitcoin crash.

Lower transaction fees. People were complaining about paying $50 transaction fees to send Bitcoin which is one of the reasons why Valve pulled Bitcoin support from Steam.

There's this new thing called Lightning Network.

London isn't a country but okay.

Yes. Then comes a couple days later where it turns 
Amazon wants their product back because it was purchased with a stolen CC and your Bitcoins have already been finalised.

It was a joke. I hope...

Is this the ancient Chinese vasectomy demonstration?
@_date: 2018-02-16 23:26:22
It works but there's always a small chance of being scammed.

Only a certain amount of transactions can fit into a block. A block is usually suppose to be 1MB of transactions which a new block is created approximately every 15 minutes. There's been some bad pools that are mining extremely small blocks though. The transactions that are lining up to be placed in a block are called unconfirmed transactions.

I HODL because of inflation in fiat currencies.

I paid 0.001BTC to withdraw from Kraken...
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:23:23
Panic sell and then post memes.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:57:42
Ah, PC Financial. I've got another bad story to tell about them. They charged me a fee to increase my daily chequing account ATM withdrawal limit because I had to pay my rent that day. It was under $1 but why do I need to pay to withdraw "my" money from PC Financial. PC Financial never again.
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:43:31
Bitcoin is an ever evolving technology. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:53:46
Well that's over 30% fee.

Blockonomics. Looking at the Bitcoin Wiki would've revealed answers too though.

Big 5 banks are shit anyways.
@_date: 2018-04-24 00:51:35
They're calling Bitcoin Cash "Bitcoin" and Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core"
@_date: 2018-04-25 23:21:22
Some people have been convinced to accidentally buy BCH because of things like this.
@_date: 2018-12-22 04:38:39
Should I do it with other cryptocurrencies exchanges as well?
