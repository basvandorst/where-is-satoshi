BTC has held at the 50day moving average for the last few days. LIKELY (according to technical analysis) to shoot up and test the $20k resistance. If it passes, expect a strong shoot up.

The drop is bigger than normal but drops are quiet normal in markets. Usually the market goes both up and down and considering that alt coins have gone up soooo much its reasonable to see it go down for a bit.
But it has dropped a bit hard sooo the other factors answered here probs contribute to the loss in market cap

Firstly that no one can REALLY say if it is with any certainty. But essentially that it shows a lot of the characteristics of a bubble (booming prices which MAY not be justified at this current point in time). Shows very similar signs to the dot com boom where there is huge excitement about its potential which causes heaps of speculative action, but this might be a bit too preemptive in bitcoins life cycle as it still has many issues with scaling/volatiltiy. 
So I am leaning more towards it is a bubble. Not saying that bitcoin isn't going to be revolutionary and be worth this much in the future, but similar to the dotcom bubble and the internet (which has drastically changed the world as well but still showed a bubble was possible) it is overextended currently. 
In any case if it is a bubble i believe this is only the start of its life cycle and once it pops will filter out all the junk ICOs. Bitcoin will likely  follow the same path as Amazon/Microsoft which had a huge crash during the dotcom boom but have now increased immensely in marketcap and is still revolutionary and recover thereafter and become huge.

My take on whether it is a bubble. Let me know what you think

Stocks are getting destroyed too. Will this make crypto more attractive?

It is all demand and supply. With volatile demand and supply it can shoot up and down super quick. Demand was booming in December (hence the crazy increase) now the demand is dying out (BTC is decreasing). Compared to other markets, the overall demand is tiny, thus even a relatively small change results in high price action movement

IS THE BULL MARKET FINALLY COMING? 
Did some technical analysis on the charts. I know TA can be unreliable at times but it does explain why there's an increase. I don't think it's a bull market though - just a temporary increase
Here's my full thoughts: 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:48:10
Agreed. Volume is still peanuts. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:45:47
I don't think TA can ever predict how much something is going to move. It's more of just a tool to see when the optimum time to buy/sell is (as opposed to randomly doing it). So no, you're right i dont think any TA could've predicted this. 
The vid discusses that I actually dont think we've bottomed out and think BTC will still continue to decrease
