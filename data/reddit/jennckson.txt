Nice. I keep decent amount of my funds in BTC, however my employer does not agree to pay me directly in BTC. Still i buy a bit more BTC from each paycheck.

According to the specs. Raspberry Pi2 is absolutely capable of handling the kind of tasks you are talking about... but I don't have any direct experience with that. Anyway, I used the Raspberry B platfrom (which is mush less performant than Raspberry Pi 2) and I was able to perform simple tasks without any issue...

I think this explains a lot

Finally, it wakes the gamer in me.
@_date: 2016-03-16 15:10:10

@_date: 2016-03-14 15:30:01
It works indeed. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 10:04:29
