I keep telling people we've already birthed Skynet...it's just getting better at manipulation of objects before it does like that Androids Dream where Amazon (or a company that closely resembles Amazon) destroys the planet to keep producing the things the humans buy.

In the US, LibertyX is creating thousands of locations for instant bitcoin purchase.  I personally just added 6 new cash retailer locations to the suburbs of Chicago in Naperville, Geneva, Streamwood, Glen Ellyn, Lombard, and Carol Stream.  Our fees are on top of a base rate that is much closer to the real price than most of the ATM's in my area.  More stores are rolling out daily across the country.  If you haven't tried LibertyX yet...you're going to love us.
Also if you own a retail store in America and want to sell real Bitcoin for cash like a prepaid card (but without the card and instant delivery via blockchain), please DM me here so I can set you up with an application.  Cheers.

Yea, since 2011 I've thought, so this is more secure than what the banks currently use and will likely be what they use in the future via natural selection.

Congratulations, and for those just entering this space trying to figure out how to buy bitcoin...download LibertyX, find a nearby location (we are rapidly adding locations nationwide), pay cash and watch it hit your bitcoin address before you walk out the door. 
If you own a business or know someone with a retail store that would like to add Bitcoin sales to their revenue stream, please direct message me.

My favorite thing about this is that the bottlenecks that presented themselves at that time have been replaced with bigger pipes.  We have a lot more runway for liftoff this time.
