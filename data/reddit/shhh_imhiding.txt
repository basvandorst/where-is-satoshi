Yeah, it doesn’t mean anything. Implementing Facebook login is as simple as something like Google or anything with connected services. They provide an API or SDKs and any developer can do it without Facebook personal permissions.

Damn, in that whole discussion I didn't read one single decent argument or thoughtful written comment, instead he(and everyone else who followed) focused on attacking him and calling him a shill. And people there just praise him for that. This is delusional levels of the_donald to me.

If it were me we would be on the moon already. Any sneeze comes with an extra 5 or 6 right after.

You’ll have issues installing an unsigned app and the dev key can be generated by the dev itself so the Play Store version and the GitHub version would most likely have the same signing key.

Already updated it seems. Full support, buy, sell, etc. All checks marked.

To be fair other exchanges show similar difference. Go to a website that aggregates data from several websites and the difference can sometimes reach that level.

I'm sure it might be, but never on the hands of Roger...

If you read further he indeed does that, as usual.

My head was not on the right place in that moment.

I laughed quite a bit more in the worldnews thread on nicehash hack with people calling it a pyramid scheme and some even directing people towards Bcash instead.

That’s exactly what is said in the quote.

Why is this still being said? There was no special treatment for NMS. If you go beyond 2 hours of gameplay you can still get a refund if you give a good reason for wanting one. There was no automated process, unless you played less than 2 hours as usual, and not everyone got refunded.

It was the top comment in the linked thread to when I replied.

Prebuilts are rarely cheaper, much less way cheaper. The price gap gets closer when you want to include everything from bluetooth to dvd/cd reader but most of the times you could build PCs for cheaper than prebuilt. Obviously that doesn’t mean it’s profitable, the gap might not be enough that you can profit from it.
Maybe software development? It’s a more long term thing when it comes to learning but it can lead to a good career or a hobby depending on what you do.

Apparently not kidding but also not as serious as he made it sound, even though it's serious it wasn't downright bombs and shit. He was selling "agricultural firecrackers", a product called Pest Control Report 2000.

Gets upset when people call it Bcash but calls Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core...

How knowledgeable can someone consider themselves when they say this: 


He's definitely not an engineer, I can guess that much. Sounds like "hey let's store user password as plain text, we currently don't have hackers attacking our network so it's fine!". There's a million other examples I could use here that shows that argument doesn't make sense to me. Sure, you could call this issue speculative and that it might never happen but what are they actually doing to stop it from ever happening? How many developers involved? Surely one can't believe that block size increases is a fully future proof solution.

If he made a bank transfer for a deposit in Coinbase he is probably limited to the international transfer times which will be one business day, so won’t work on the weekends but will be there monday morning if he does. Gdax or Gemini wouldn’t help here, only for lower fees or instant buy(that is if you don’t have that enabled in Coinbase).

It would either require miners to get a reward (like they currently do, but without necessarily existing a token or value involved in the “transactions”), to mine without reward(unrealistic) or most likely central authorities (centralized but not a bad thing depending on the application imo since in some scenarios we would value security/privacy over insurance/ownership which are critical for currencies). I also guess that depending on application there wouldn’t necessarily be a need for fighting over next block rights(as in no need for immediate or fast confirmation). I will admit, this is purely speculation on my part considering my knowledge of blockchain and cryptography. I’m in no way more knowledgeable in this area than many others so I could be mistaken

I don't know, they might have a reason for it like starting small and adding bit by bit going long term. No reason to judge them as 12 yo or as leaving in a third world country for whatever reason they might want to buy some btc.

Exactly, from what I understand the point of blockchain is to allow transactions to be trust-less, it doesn’t mean you need to transfer something of value. It could be used for many other areas where standard cryptography is used, from messages, validating personal info or whatever. It all depends on implementation which is why blockchain is an awesome tech and should not be solely restricted to currency. Obviously the first and most obvious use case is transactions of value where the value needs to be independently verified but it’s not the only one.

Definitely seems like it. Hopefully it's as a big of a deal as it sounds, specially seeing it as a web standard and the companies behind it.

It's at an all time high looking at the full year.

You have to start somewhere. It isn't always reasonable to invest a lot if someone's new and doesn't have a lot of disposable income.

This would be a web standard so it doesn't necessarily replace Apple Pay. Credit cards and online payment systems work yet Apple Pay can still be successful. Apple could also incorporate this into it and charge a fee like Apple Pay so I don't think there's anything wrong behind it. As for what's in it for them? Many tech companies like to contribute to open and/or universally used standards, for web or not, Apple included.

And their website still says replay protection is fully implemented, AFAIK since it went live... shame shame shame

I’m guessing people are getting ready for both forks(Bitcoin Gold and 2x) to make some money.
