Bitcoin is dead OP, sell now and cut your losses
@_date: 2014-05-20 08:09:38
HA. Nope. I honestly thought you guys would say something like 2030, but 6 years? HAHAHA! Alright, let's make this bet. PM me.

More people use Paypal than Bitcoin and it will always be that way, forever and ever. Want to make a bet?

Facebook. No contest. I bet you 500,000,000 BTC.

I'm proud. I remember 2006, everyone saying Nintendo was dead and now here we are. Sony and Microsoft got fucking dominated last gen in sales. It's perfect. And this gen PC is dominating consoles. It's like a dream come true. But of course people try and deny Wii Sports as the most sold game of all time. So it's a bit of both, actually.

Implying Paypal isn't beating Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:49:08
But it is still the most sold game of all time; deal with it.

If you're so confident, let's go. If Bitcoin eclipses Paypal in users by a certain date, I will give you 1BTC, as it is worth today. If they do not by that date, you give me $1000. If you disagree, then you accept that Paypal will always be bigger than BTC.

You're so fucking paranoid.

Bitcoiners don't tend to go outside. Or spend money.

Except PayPal works absolutely fine, I can connect my debit card to it and it works and there is no other service like it. I'm sure if the idiots on this subreddit made one it would be Bitcoin and credit card only and it would die in a week. Reddit has ADHD.

No, it isn't. People bought a console, and got the game by buying. Therefore, they bought the game. Deal. With. It.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:26:05
Tetris doesn't count because it isn't the same game people are buying, they buy different versions for different platforms. The most sold game of all time is Wii Sports.

What part of deal with it don't you understand?

It's a paywall you stupid piece of shit

Holy shit, I just realised we are in the future.

Congratulations, this is the post that makes me leave this POS subreddit.
