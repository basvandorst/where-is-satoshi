If I could get my 5.4 back I'd love you. I'll take 1000 but 5.4 would get me back where I was and be very much appreciated.

True, not all depression is chemical and it can very much be situational and if the situation lasts a long time it can make for a prolonged depression. I work at a mental health facility and I've seen it with people who have jobs that destroy them. The entire time they have the job they are suicidally depressed and they have no prior history or family history. Once the stressor is removed they magically get better. I've seen it a lot in highschool teachers in low income areas.

You just wait ten years until you make the minimum. I'm in the same boat. Two tiny tips. And by that I mean I have a small two-headed penis.

I have a question about the tracking a specific coin thing. Say a turquoise coin represents my car. What prevents someone from  just making another of the same color and say they own my car? Or is "color" just a term used to mean personalized, as in you can say this coin represents such and such? I haven't read anything about them so far so sorry if this is a basic question. I do own something like 0.000006 of a "penis" colored bitcoin. So if anyone wants to buy it let me know.

Behind what? Like it's not posting tips? Perhaps it's being used a lot and needs to catch up but I can't say that because I'm not sure what you are asking. What exactly is the question?

You may want to wait until it goes stable for a bit again if you plan on buying a good chunk.

Yeah, I was speaking of crypto. Everyone gets scammed somehow sometimes. Go to a comedy show, buy a ticket and the find out there's a two drink minimum at 15 buck for a gin and tonic. 2 dollars extra if you want a lime with it.

I'm interested in doing the same thing sometime soon. My friend said something about one that had a tamper-proof hologram sticker type thing hiding the private key. I'll ask him when I see him and reply to the thread if it doesn't get an answer before I post it.

Why thank you good sir. I hope it was good for you, too. I just read that when using too as a synonym for also it must be preceded with a comma. It's true because I heard someone say it like they meant it. There you go. I shared knowledge for bits.

Holy shit. I got a $3.05 tip and was walking on sunshine today. Have a nice week.
@_date: 2014-07-31 19:28:37
Yes I think people know. I figured other people use coinbase and have received the 5 dollars already since it's been a while since I've logged on. I'm not asking coinbase because they take too long to reply. Thanks for your response I really appreciate the input.

Haha, thanks man. A taco? That's a first. I've seen grams of silver, bits, ubits and mbtc but never a taco.

So you upvote anything related to bitcoin no matter the quality of the post or did I just miss the point completely?

The real question is why are Marty and the doc friends? Where did they meet and what does a teenager have in common with a physicist? Saw that earlier today.

I reserve Facebook for friends not people who I can remember their name if shown a picture (maybe) but know nothing about, excluding celebrities and public figures I'm interested in and want to know show dates (comedians). That's me personally and I know number of people who feel the same way. I also know people who consider it a weird type of popularity thing. But the number is almost double what normal people typically have as acquaintances which aren't even friends. It is nice to know you are considering different numbers, at least you are thoughtful.
@_date: 2014-05-04 20:49:46
This seems interesting. Tip me.
@_date: 2014-05-21 20:00:03
It has to be an actual credit card. They need to know you have a line of credit. If you can't get one I doubt there is a work around. There isn't anything pre-paid that can give them an indication that you have a in of credit. If there is a way around this I'd be surprised but not super surprised since humans are cleaver beings sometimes.
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:37:16
I like my hair but thanks anyway.

I'll post a picture of the 2oz's that I recently purchased later tonight or tomorrow afternoon. I might have a picture of it on my phone now.

Perhaps since it's being used in more places and there need to be something changed since it started getting more used than it was used to/designed for at current time? Maybe just some fluke. Good question.
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:27:03
I don't think prepaid is a line of credit. It's your own money.

I'll do that, thanks. I wasn't aware they had a sub.

There is also a place called bitcoin insanity that you can use but on buy 25 USD per day. I have no clue how reputable the company is though.

That's one of the few shows they have I dislike. That dude just rubs me the wrong way. Same with Hamilton Morris's voice but I let him slide because it's just the way he sounds not him personally.

30 bits verify. Also, rogan, Duncan Trussell, Brendon Walsh, Joey Diaz and all the deathsquad guys go to the ice house constantly and are much better. Or just go to the comedy store and you can probably just talk to Pauly. He does kinda own it or will when mitsy passes.

I've always bought from coinbase. I never claimed to know a lot about BTC. I'll just have some extra funds and would like suggestions as to best place to trade. No need to be a dick and if you didn't mean to come off that way I'm sorry but you very much did so maybe look into the way you communicate with people.
