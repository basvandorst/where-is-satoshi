Hey. Wonderful app. Thanks

Well, some words are encrypted in one file and others in another file with an order that I only can easily remember and mixed. So even if someone crack my 2fa and find the files and can decrypt there is another layer.

Buy tether coin instead.

I encrypted my seed (and not the full seed in one encrypted file) and sent it to a safe place protected with 2fa 
@_date: 2017-01-11 17:54:29
No more. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:36:17
Yeah. They are saying but clearly nobody is doing :)

So for those who are not aware of this, a short crash will be soon coming (or not, I am not God), since multiple Chinese BTC platforms offer free loan and it ends by January 7th Beijing time. A lot of Chinese BTC holders will have to sell their BTC to pay back the loan (or not, they might have already done that), so there will be a crash coming before this happens. I don't think this will perminantly tank the market, so prepare to buy once the price hit the bottom. Again this is only my prediction.

I had a buy order at 800. I'm really happy. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:21:31
He just said buy the dip and sell at top
@_date: 2017-01-14 17:15:19
Yeah you're right 
@_date: 2016-11-26 16:19:51
I will, thanks.

And yeah, I can use localbitcoins, I'm a system admin, but you know what? That takes 2 or more days to just add a receiver with my bank (if it's accepted), so if you read all my posts you can see that it's a week that I'm struggling with that.
And I'm someone that makes almost everything online, I'm not a noob. Moreover I left my county and opened many differents accounts in more than 2 countries and more than 3 languages.

The problem is that I had an account with kraken when the website opened (I still have their first mails) at the time it was only a nice idea so I never used it, I received mail from them for a long time.
Now I'm back to bitcoins and my kraken account ask me for a master password that at the time I never entered (I know for sure I keep all my differents password in a relly safe way). So I can't use my account and I can't open another account with my email. YEah I can create another mail, but...
I asked to the support, I'm waiting. I hope there will be no issue then.

Yes, 15 dollars after you realized that 20 other ways are impossible, it's too much for someone that want to start using BTC.
@_date: 2016-11-26 10:20:43
Look at my problems this week... (I'm in France)
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:43:55
From what I know glidera is kraken and swish is their new coin, there is an ico those days. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 09:13:23
Yeah I know, my post was only to show how fucking hard is for people (even those who have the knowledge) to access this money.
See the post below...

BTC-E has 15 euro of fees minimum.

Honestly I don't think dollar will become stronger, I think the opposite... 
@_date: 2016-11-26 09:13:27
Yeah I'm trying, struggling with them last 4 days, my accounts where activeted in 2013 and I'm still trying to retake my kraken account (was one of the firsts and everything has changed in the authentication system) and trying to find wihich one of my ID bitstamp wants (everytime I get a refusal take 2 days...). I tried every service, I was able to use circle for a bit but now I'm blocked (I think cause I'm in EU) it's a week... 
I found yesterday coinmate and they accepted my IDs, still waiting that my bank accept his IBAN after 2 days...
it took less hassle and time to leave my country and found another one...
I know it's not bitcoin fault, but it's really a fucking shit.
@_date: 2016-11-26 15:10:34
Thanks but locally there is nothing...
France is the hell of everything that is digital...
Btw I found some italian group I can ask to them.
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:54:05
I'm on your side...
Do you figured how to exit? I'm thinking of buying monero and eth, but I'm looking close to the tether coin exit...

Man, I feel you...
Read my post from yestarday...

appears to say Bitmain is using a flaw in Bitcoin's PoW to gain mining advantage and blocking SegWit because it fixes that advantage
