Oh? You are so sure, is there any back up to support your claim? I am not challenging you, I am just trying to figure out the truth.

Well yea in the case of aniner s9 yes.  I was thinking of the sucky alternatives because not everybody is lucky wnough to get their desired antminers.

Really? That address gets black listed.  Good luck doing anything with that address.  Unless he waits ten years and people forget it.  
Hacker is only temporarily on the loose, I hope..

I suggest you split 0/100 and invest all in BCH and stop telling people to invest in BCH.

You can’t blame her, she’s half right about calling it a pyramid scheme.  It does look like a pyramid scheme due to it increasing in value so fast thanks to the number of people joining in increased almost exponentially.  So yes, looks like one because pyramid scheme rely on people pouring in to increase the value of the stock or whatever the trading unit is.  Take time to explain to her by agreeing with her with what I stated above.  Then explain the other benefits of bitcoin which bring values that people buy because they recognized - besides the price gain expectations.

You are correct. My idea of black list means the investigators are on it.  Not saying exchange will immediately recognize the dirty money when it sees one.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:38
Maybe.. there might be loops around it.. who knows.  It would be safe to assume the hacker knows about this too.  But I think he will let the situation cools a little before he tries anything next.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:07:44
Here’s the idea, and I am not claiming that I am an expert at any of this.  But by common sense, any other addresses send and receive from this will be interrogated.  It DOES NOT mean that the moment there are new transactions of sends or receive from the blacklisted address the perpetrator will be caught immediately. What it means is that they just need to scan the database and logs on a schedule basis to see if the blacklisted address have a recent activity on any exchange platform which would allow him to cash out.  
The perpetrator would be lucky to find an idiot that wants to buy his bitcoin by cash and with no witness meaning without using an exchange.  If this is the case then the victim will be interrogated by FBI and will be suspected to be the perpetrator instead.  Either someone will be caught whether he is the true perpetrator or the scapegoat.  
My idea definitely have some flaws.  Feel free to point out if you find any.  I just hope that fker gets caught and all the victims gets their koney back.

The proper action is to listen to your grandpa and that professor.  They definitely have more experience about life.  Sell all your bitcoins to me!

I would set up a world disaster relieve fund.  Whenever there a natural disaster that devastate a region, they can request for an amount reasonable, enough to avoid unnecessary deaths due to hunger and lack of shelters.  
Then I would set up another animal shelter funding that would rigorously verify the good deeds of animal shelters around the world before giving them money.  
Then I would set up another save-the-future fund.  Any projects related to preserving the Earth for our future generations can request support from here.  Non-action projects such as Research projects will have to prove they’re making good progress in order to continue.  Otherwise things like planting new trees, saving endangered species, etc. gets approved easier.
Then finally, scholarships to students who are first or second generation, and demonstrate financial hardships but have good grades in school.  
All of that should only cost 10,000 bitcoins or less.  I split the 90,000 bitcoins up and SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS HAHAHAHAHAHA

Your concern is valid and possibility is definitely there.  My answer is I don’t know.  Bitcoin has enemies everywhere, left and right.  No worries though, throughout the whole decade no enemies were able to butt-fk bitcoin.  Excuse my language.  The real gold stands the test of time.
My personal opinion on government is that they would rather join it for the win-win by putting a license system in place and implement tax on crypto.  If they want the lose-lose scenario then all the exchanges in US (or whichever your country is) will close down but that’s is so not a problem for bitcoiners lol.  It’s the fking internet.  Good luck stopping anyone from continuing their bitcoin trading.  You can always move your bitcoins out to another reliable exchange that is still legal in a different country.  And even if all exchanges in the entire world get banned and closes down.  The you will still get the dark net - the black market of things.  My point is it’s costly trying to stop bitcoin where as it’s profitable joining it.

Agree, as long as it’s not stealing power lol.  5 cents per kwh or less is what you should aim for.  Else just buy btc on a consistent basis, like $500 a month or $125 a week for example.  Advantage is you won’t panic sell and willing to hold long term which is the best strategy so far for btc buyers.

Bitcoin’s value is in integrity and full security.  All transactions are verifiable and it would take $34 billions effort to fake a single bitcoin.  In combination with the above, it is not centralized.  No single group of people have control or the ability to create bitcoins out of thin air.  It is a breakthrough technology that few understands.  Did you know that there’s a bunch of other crypto currency similar to bitcoin (only several thousands of them!).  They all failed because they lack the combination of the good qualities bitcoin carry.  There are more to talk about such as the wallet and transferring money.  It’s free!  The only time someone pay a transfer fee is because the person is using an exchange platform and not a personal wallet.  There’s more, but just know that since 2009, every year, every month, day and minute, thousands of people call it “a bubble”.  Bubble that lasts 10 years? Okay, I dive into this bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:01:22
This is where I am also stuck.  But all you need is an expert who understand how to trace back just like how bitcoins do transaction verifications.  I am not technical enough to explain this. Sorry.

Another charity idea, how about give out scholarships based on criteria and qualifications that you think is best fit.  Because that is investing in the future which is not emphasized enough nowadays.  The future!

Good thinking, though.

It’s only hacker proof.  If all data entered are real and legit, then no one can hack it to tamper with the data.  
So after the point of data entry, it is safe.  But no one can guarantee what happens before the point of data entry.  That’s when foul play can still happen.

Yes, very likely.  Unless the HDD looks really old then there's a higher chance that the owner threw it out without transferring the 950 BTC because it has much lower worth back then.  However this drive looks pretty new (like good condition), so the owner probably did transfer the 950 BTC to a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-11 20:07:49
so.. as bitcoin prices going up the bitcoin comedic value goes down? Am I right or am I right?

Hello bitcoin community, There is a new breakthrough coming up.  I present to you - Bitcoin-Coin!!

Just use smaller units of btc.
.1 = deci-Bitcoin
.01 = centi-Bitcoin (that’s why it’s called cent in USD also - coicindence? No.)
.001 = milli-Bitcoin
.000001 = micro-Bitcoin
Just like gold you can’t just always have a whole 1 kg or 1 pound of gold!  You can have portions of it clarified in smaller units.

Because he’s buying bitcoin using credit card.  There’s a limit per account if you’re using credit card(cuz ur buying w/ the money u don’t have).  So unless you want log off and on constantly for multiple accounts..
Either way, he’s still an idiot.. :&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:27:09
The idea is they are centralized is what made it not ok.  The fork was a different issue.  The fork was to make people feels like they got a head start and also to help them (bch founders) at least get a nice pump and dump if bch fails.

I will report it to the police as it is definitely a trap.  If i try to move it to my wallet then it will serve as evidence that I was part of that.. OH WAIT THIS IS A TRAP!

Also, don’t forget that if bitcoin actually somehow crashes and will cause you to commit suicide - that either mean you’re investing too much or investing what you can’t afford to lose.  
Always have a back up plan.  Better be safe than sorry.  Play it safe.  Play it smart.  Play it both smart and safe.

Oh gotcha, very good point.  To elaborate your point further there are places where the national currency inflate like crazy so people rush to buy gold and precious rocks/metal.  
But the inflation of the national currency is caused by government, not so much of because bitcoin deflates.  
If 10 years into the future, $1000 can only buy a loaf of bread, bitcoin’s deflation didn’t cause that, it would be because of the printing of money and other causes.  
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:08:59
Yea I was agreeing and adding more not really arguing against you.
Edit:  ok but your last reply is incorrect - you’re stating bit coins deflates because all fiat inflates.  That’s not the main reason..

They make more money &amp; faster money selling the equipment.  Think about real life gold mine equipment.  You can ask the same question, why don't they keep the equipment and mine the gold themselves.  Same answer, there are so many buyers out there you get rich instantly just by making and selling the equipment.  Instant money, instant profit, less risks.
