Be careful you're not buying repeatedly. I am allotted 6 transfers from my savings each month. I went over on a few transactions and I ended up not getting those bitcoins at all, when the price was lower at that time. Also keep in mind coinbase charges $30 for an "insufficient funds" transaction.

I think you give the majority of this defective species on earth too much benefit of the doubt.

I prefer the visual aesthetic of keep key to trezor. I will probably be ordering one as well.

Please expand good sir. I desire to know the truth.

it will allow 401k's and hedge funds to diversify, adding bitcoin into their portfolios. I have no doubt there would be plenty of interest in it from the big leagues, which if I'm not mistaken could add billions to the market cap.

 is already in the works.
Def will become the ultimate tracking system by governments if it is to become globally adopted. Governments WILL collude once bitcoin takes off.
If it's globally adopted, fiat currencies are likely to have collapsed to a significant extent. my 2 cents.

web bot predicted &gt;$1000 in a a good few months paired with the rise of silver. bitcoin would consolidate down to about $800, silver would not go down. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:32:21
yup, it'll take a few months to get to another ATH for this year.

Because of events like in Dallas, obama is pushing his agenda to Federalize the police. 
Loretta Lynch is also going around doing the arrangements. 
We need to get the democrat party the hell away from the fucking white house. wake up. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:06:22
At least until 2020, and I will keep adding to my booty until then.

a LOT of americans don't even know why we celebrate 4th of july. you can't expect dumbed down zombies, breaking their necks looking down on their smart phones and talking selfies, to even desire to know these things.
