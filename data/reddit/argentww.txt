We are all hoping for a pump this year, or at least in January. The best time to invest is right now, so why not to get right into it ?

Hi. A good platform that could help you is [cryptocoin.pro]( . As far as I know, they accept Revolut card. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:51:25
Hi there...The price is pretty low, the fluctuations - smoth. Buy now, ultil it didn't reach 7-7,5k. This is going to happen soon, for we are waiting for a bull trap. Don't miss the moment. Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:52:08
We face the situation we are not sure what is going to happen next. Checking the news and predictions regarding bumping and dumping BTC, nobody has an exact answer. So, waiting, trusting and hoping is all we got at the moment.

Hello! There are lots of platforms you can buy from. What can I tell you is that there are many fake ones that would steal your money. The best one, so far, is [cryptocoin.pro]( . If you are looking for a platform you can start your tradings, it is one of the best choices. Easy to use and really safe. Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-09-19 17:12:01
A good platform where you can buy using your debit card is [cryptocoin.pro]( , where I am trading right now. It is really easy to buy using just your card. It has some low fees, but guys are working fast and you are sure you can stay safe and don't worry about your money. Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:47:42
A really trusted and good platform to invest in is [cryptocoin.pro]( . Since I discovered it, am trading with them. I am very impressed about how fast and safe they are working! Good luck

Probably he bought the car let's say with 50K BTC, hoping to buy the second Lamborghini in the Dec-Jan, after it's going to bullish :))) Just a hodling fan from Ca, nothing special =) 
@_date: 2018-09-12 07:48:02
Did you sell everything you own just to buy BTC so often? No matter that price you buy with is not the highest.
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:03:13
There are no safe platforms without fees. You better pay instead of being stolen or scammed. Trusted platforms usually ask for small fees, just for your own safety. For example, [bitstamp.net]( or [cryptocoin.pro]( will ask for small taxes. Good luck

I started to use this platform, and It seems to be totally good and safe. Thank you for your advice ;) 
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:28:53
I like the way you are doing this. We must support the cryptocurrency, for it is going to become an important economic step in the future. Being based on blockchain, this technology will give us a chance to start trading different, more wise, fast, safe.

I accidentally answered you 2 times, I just wanted to help, for I saw people waiting for help.

Good, good. So, It begins ;) The new era of currency
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:35:38
You have to look for a good trading platform. Personally, I was into Coinbase, since I found a new one named [cryptocion.pro]( If you live in Europe, you can use It. I hope It will help you ;) 
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:13:24
This is the right time to buy It now, for It's price should rise again. You should look for a good platform to invest in, but I personally suggest you an european platform named cryptocoin.pro , that helped me alot in investment process. I will invest in Bitcoin now, on this platform. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:11:24
He is not thinking professional. I asked somebody who really knows why,where,how. But, thank you ! 
@_date: 2018-08-01 12:06:43
Haha, No way :) 
@_date: 2018-08-28 13:09:18
Yup, a sign from God :) 
@_date: 2018-08-01 13:36:57
 Do you think Bitcoin will crash in the future or It has to become our daily currency? What are your thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:17:54
Hello! The first things you have to worry about are your data privacy and safety.  I am currently using a platform named [cryptocoin.pro]( , that is definitely one of the best from new platforms appearing on market now. If you are living in Europe, It will be really useful for you, as it is fast, simple and safe. I saw lots of people sharing this platform here on the web, so I decided to try it. And I can recommend you to do the same. Good luck to you ! 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:43:08
Coinbase I a good exchange platform, so you can thare there.But I recently found another good EU platform, where I plan to invest. It is named [cryptocoin.pro]( . I read their terms and I am really impressed about what they can do. Good luck ! ;) 
@_date: 2018-08-04 10:35:10
Hi. I heard the same troubles about Coinbase in Canada area, so you have to look for another platform that can help you to invest correctly, with low fees, to keep your money in safe. I have few friends using a platform called [ . They invested huge amounts of money and they told, It is a good deal, being truly impressed. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:12:28
Sounds good. Thank you ;) 
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:07:07
I started to use this platform and they have a very friendly custom support, so they solved few of my problems instantly. I'll continue to speak with them about investment ideas. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 17:02:54
You can tell about any other cryptocurrency the same thing, can't you ? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 12:27:12
Personally, I can recommend you a platform that becomes more and more trusted by people day by day. it is famous in Europe, and I think you can check it. The name of this platform is [cryptocoin.pro]( and it is really safe and good. Good luck !
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:03:23
Where and how can I start trading ? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:08:32

@_date: 2018-08-01 13:51:12
Appreciate this, thank you! 
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:50:15
Haha, funny. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:45:05
It is better for him to buy Bitcoin now, for It is the oldest currency and It became stable during the time. But where will he buy? I guess you already had suggestions to buy from Coinbase, But I really can not recomand you this platform. THere are many others you can choose from. I studied some of them, and I can definitely recommend you one named [cryptocoin.pro]( . So, If your dad is from Europe, he can take a look. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 08:12:21
Waiting, waiting and waiting are your friends here.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:41:23
You can not do this without your ID. You have to prove that you are the person buying bitcoin just for your own safety.  Good luck 
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:00:37
Hello! The best one so far is [cryptocoin.pro]( .I've been using the site for a few months, and it is a really good and trusted source. Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:38:12
Both of them are fluctuating. Nobody knows how much one or another will go up or down. But BTC's price will definitely spike. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:12:05
There is a good platform that has come out, but it is already trusted by community. The name is [cryptocoin.pro]( and the reasons why I can recommend you this platform is because of:
1. It is fast and easy to use
2. You have your own wallet, once you create an account there. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:37:46
[cryptocoin.pro]( Thea best one so far. Really a safe and a very good platform. Low fees and a very friendly customer support. Good luck! 
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:56:58
Hello! It is not a problem that you don't have a credit card. You can buy using bank transfer. There is a safe trading platform named [cryptocoin.pro]( . that accepts bank transfer. More than that, they have no fees if you pay by this method.  I am using it right now. Really satisfied. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:50:55
@_date: 2018-07-26 10:26:47
That is a great number ! ;) 
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:14:21
Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 09:57:05
It could be better if this is going to happen in many other countries around the world.  
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:10:36
Are you serious? How did bank comment this event? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:47:07

@_date: 2018-07-26 06:46:50
Unfortunately, I am from the USA :) 
@_date: 2018-07-27 04:15:12
Good joke :D 
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:39:58
Yes, USA. But somebody told me that coinbase is not so professional and they made lots of mistakes when It comes to custommer service .But anyway ,thank you ! 
@_date: 2018-07-26 06:52:50
Are they really fees-free ?
