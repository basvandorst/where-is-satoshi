That's not the case. You may be thinking of this:  
They used to allow you to send money to exchanges, sort of complementing the real btc exchanges, by giving you a decent fiat to fiat rate on the way in / avoiding a wire charge.

Unfortunately Mr Galloway is a pretty unsavoury character. He also is a publicity candidate who can't win in London. Regardless of that, let's play the ball and not the man here. 
He actually _can't_ do anything other than sign fiat transactions into the ledger. He's constrained by a fiat-in and fiat-out reality of government. That's not a horrible idea but isn't really that useful.

Britian is about to get a raft of new banks since the 2013 capital changes. My bet is one or more of these will be bitcoin friendly. If not, it will cost less than 2mm GBP to set one up that is.

If I'm not mistaken, the limit is in place to stop miners from producing blocks which are huge, for example by stuffing a block with essentially meaningless transactions which they are the source and recipient of. 
We cannot prove this would have been done had the limit not been in place, but I think it's reasonable to assume it would have been done in fairly short order after the ability to short bitcoin came about on exchanges a few years ago, and probably would have happened before that economic incentive, "just for the lols".

Unless they have taken a large short position on one of the exchanges that let you do that. You could easily make more money than the cost of equipment if you knew you could tank the price.

Basically, they let Mike Hearn of GmbH (bitcoin core developer), run an sql query which summed their user holdings, then they did a send to self transaction and he verified the numbers matched up.
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:36:17
The signed message is proof they had 183K coins, at that moment in time.
The verification of the accounts btc balances summing to 183K is a bit weaker, and they didn't verify the fiat balances. So, a good start, to be applauded, but only a good start, a long way from being a proof of solvency.

As long as the withdrawal fee is small, I don't think that's such a big issue. It's at least more transparent than some crazy anti-spam measure.

correct. if you make two transactions and sign both even though they conflict and you broadcast both, you've attempted a double spend. normal wallets won't let you do this, unless they have a deliberate "malicious mode" or something.

Ah, rational self interest. unless these guys are like The Joker from batman, “It’s not about the money, it’s about sending a message. Everything burns!”.  Personally, I don't see that though!
@_date: 2014-02-04 15:03:16
If they genuinely have BTC to cover all deposits, they need an auditor to step in and say so, like right fucking now. They could invite someone to inspect user accounts and BTC wallet balances no?
And, also, solve their technical issues, like right fucking now.
Because, frankly, it looks like they're insolvent. I'm 98% sure they're insolvent. I'm not sure the market really gets it though? Why isn't there more than a 15-20% price difference between them and bitstamp, if they genuinely are insolvent? People think they can just keep going and claw back enough from fees? WTF? I got out 8 months ago and was worried as hell back then!
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:57:02
It doesn't really prove bitcoin solvency though does it? Proof is a hard thing. It makes me believe it on balance maybe, but ultimately you're relying on assumptions: 
We don't know for sure that their uses account balances sum to 183K BTC - we have to trust Mike Hearn on this, and he could be being dishonest or could have been fooled (e.g. certain rows dropped from the database, temporarily). We have no reason to suspect either case there, but it is still an assumption.

bitstamp or btc-e. I think bitstamp is generally considered the the safest right now, just because of the lack of transparency about who/where btc-e really is incorporated/based.

He has a large personal investment in that fund. It's not just, "someone else's money", he's incentivised based on fund performance right, just like all VCs. 25MM is what, probably between 5-20% of that fund (didn't look it up, based on averages). So I'd assume the 1BTC thing is just him thinking, "I've already got enough skin in the game thank you very much".

"A useful improvement for future observed proofs would be for the observer to work in tandem with a third party, the identity of whom is kept secret from the exchange. The third party would open an account and deposit a small challenge amount. The observer could then request to view the database entries for that person’s account speciﬁcally, to make it harder to provide a substitute database that has some deposit amounts erased or lowered. Unfortunately there was insuﬃcient time to perform such a challenge in this review"
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:44:30
Yeah. Exactly, I'm just surprised the difference isn't greater than the existing 15-20% premium. I would say that a 20% risk premium on getting your *fiat* out of there, right now, is a dramatic understatement. I'd expect BTC prices to be at least 50% higher than market, perhaps even 100%, given no-one is seemingly able to withdraw.

By the time all the bitcoin has been mined, 800 USD will equal 43384.60 USD. (Yes, I know that misses the point.) 
(800*1.0322^126) 3.22% is last 100 years inflation average.

The APs can take physical delivery, no? That's how ETFs work in general. A retail customer can't, but an AP can, which is the main thing that will keep the price roughly in line.

They already say they'll halt creation/redemption for 48hrs or until the situation becomes clear. If an ETH/ETC situation arises, where a winner of 100% of the value of the original chain does not look likely to occur, they could auction off the smaller chain, buying the larger chain and adding the coins to each current basket in proportion. Then resume creation/redemption with an increased basket size. Done? I'd say it'd be cleaner to issue a dividend, and keep the basket size the same, but I don't know if that's allowed, plus it sucks to have to re-invest if the intention of people is to HODL the larger chain.

Because I've got 150Mb broadband it's hard to find a VPN that doesn't slow me down considerably, so I only use one intermittently. Basically if it's not work related. I know this is less than ideal, but I do use a separate browser profile as well to mitigate it a bit.
@_date: 2017-01-12 17:16:05
It lets people buy them in a tax sheltered way, in many cases. And they still do actually hold the bitcoins for you rather than just track the price, so it still affects supply and demand, so would have an effect on the price.

But where can I get a server which I can pay for with BTC for £5 a month? No use getting a VPN which is linked to me via a CC eh

The emails they sent were signed with the key, and you didn't send them, that's you losing control of your keys (albeit by trusting those keys to a third party).
@_date: 2015-04-10 02:14:56
They lost control of their own email identity (in that they lost control of their signing keys). They can't know what customer data has been lost, because they don't know what correspondence has gone on in their name. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 01:17:04
I'm not suggesting they write their own email service. I'm suggesting they simply host any number of the open source email servers themselves. There's quite a difference.


Exactly my point. DKIM signing *involves* a private key. If you are the only one holding the key, you are necessarily generating  the whole MIME message. Sending it is trivial.


Straw man nonsense.
Edit: I just clocked you're an employee. s/they/you/g. You're getting phished, which you wouldn't be if you owned your own DKIM key, so your snark about writing web browsers is stupid in this context. 
Edit edit: coinbase.com.		300	IN	TXT	"v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:mailgun.org include:amazonses.com ~all" - SOFTFAIL! Give me one good reason why that isn't -all? 3 includes is ridiculous. I can't be bothered to look your DKIM and dmark setup, but you should get a grip on this really.
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:28:10
I really don't think you should be using a third party at all to be honest, there's too much at stake here, and you're introducing another element in the chain of trust. It's not that hard at all to do dmark, DKIM, SPF &amp; get a few clean IPs and manage this yourself.

Very cool.
That said, I'm just looking at your website, could do with a little polish TBH, lots of small things but these things really matter:
I really dislike the inertial scrolling you've got going. 
The "making bitcoin easy" transition is nice, but you need to hide the text with css before the transition starts! it briefly appears before it flashes away and the transition starts.
If you click Personal or Business you can't get rid of the modal that pops up.
I'm sure there are lots more examples. My day rate is 3BTC if you want a full UX audit!
