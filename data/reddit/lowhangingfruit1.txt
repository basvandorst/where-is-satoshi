You're severely misinterpreting my post. I'm not talking about who is the bigger military power. I'm talking about who poses the bigger threat to my country. It makes little difference to the penguin if it's eaten by a tiger or leopard seal. But the penguin has excellent relations with the tiger, it lives far away and has never expressed any interest in the penguins other than open trade whereas the leopard seal lives close and has a habit of eating penguins like Georgia and Krim, and has made ill-concealed threats to continue doing so.  
US generals do not have publicly displayed maps on their walls where my country is annexed. The US has never occupied us, invaded us or waged war on us, nor have they even threatened to invade. US officials have never spoken publicly about the US future, where the buffer states are forcibly brought back in the fold.  
So yeah, I'm pretty fucking sure the US doesn't pose as much of a threat **to me** as Russia.

Coming from a country bordering Russia, they are scary as fuck. They constantly use intimidation tactics, they fund far-right parties across Europe to spur dissent, they fund newspapers that spread hatred, lies and ill-concealed pro-Russian propaganda in bordering countries.
They publicly repeat the old Russian motto, that anything that once belonged to Russia should belong to Russia.
They do big military exercises near the borders, they violate foreign airspace almost daily, they do close flybys on foreign military vessels and near-ramming maneuvers on international waters.
Russia is fucking scary. If things go Putins way, with Trump, Brexit, potentially Italeave and Fruckoff, right-wing racist bastards in power the help will be too little and too late to save the Baltics from becoming Russian buffer states. Again.
Fuck those guys.
