I bought mine even before I bought any coin... Better to be safe than sorry

I'm new to this whole situation and I'm not sure I'm cut out for it ... I've got just under 0.1 and I'm paranoid as hell... But at the same time I wouldn't second guess going out and spending it.
Trying to convince myself to hodl but I'm not sure I can

I just bought a little more just before this drop a little upsetting but gotta HODL

I'm 21... Seen this movie and haven't seen the Johnny Depp version.

Thank you good sir. This is my first experience of a continuous decline (if you want to call it that) I'm sure I'll get used to it... Maybe....I'll buy more? And cry myself to sleep in fear. I'm serious limbo right now.

Good observation

You telling me to buy more? Because I'm at my limit on coinbase and this drop although I want to sell I told myself to at the start not too and I'm still trying to convince myself not to sell but at the same time I want more!

Did the same... Not worrying too much as I'm confident it will go up again.... Hopefully
