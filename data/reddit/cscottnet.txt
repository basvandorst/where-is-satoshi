So I'm still wasting CPU time on this.  Here are the keyspaces I've exhausted:
1. 4 numeric digits
1. [4-letter words from `/usr/share/dict/american-english-large`, with all combinations of upper-and-lower case](
1. [a large number of variations on 'doge'](
1. a combination of 4 of the following characters: B⃦฿ɃᗸB⃫Ⓑⓑᴃⓢ0123456789. !
1. a combination of 4 of the following characters: 🐶🐕🐾💩☃✡✈🏢฿

The inputs would certainly be different: otherwise the network would reject it as a double-spend.  But as you say, the outputs would be identical, and the script code for the earlier transaction would deviate in one of a few well-known ways from what MtGox produces.

I agree that a better challenge would be to specify a smaller character set, chosen so that it can be brute forced in about a day of effort, but announce in advance that the challenges will be repeated on a regular basis (say once a month or once a week).
That rewards time spent improving the software, and hopefully would lead to some exciting races each month/week.  The sample size will be larger and so the results will be more reasonable to extrapolate to larger key lengths/character sets.
(Hand-waving:) That is, if I know with strong probability that a non-word "a-z only" password of length 5 is being regularly solved in ~1 day, then a password of length 6 should be solvable in ~26 days and I probably need a password of length 8 in order to be secure for ~1 decade.  You'd really want to factor in an exponential rate of hardware improvement as well, etc etc.

Having dabbled in the field academically, I will say that it's *very* unlikely that anyone who has published a single-author paper on "Provably Secure ... Signature Schemes" is the author of the bitcoin protocol.  Cryptographers who work on "provably secure" algorithms are mathematicians.  Bitcoin was created by an engineer.
Also -- note that many of these papers look alike because they are all typeset with LaTeX.  The Newsweek author made some crap claim about "2 spaces after a period" which happens to just be the LaTeX default style.

You don't know what you're talking about.  I suggest you read some of the recent papers on datamining the blockchain.
And you should probably watch  to understand how the police work as well.
Summary: change transactions are very revealing, and clustering techniques can also be used to infer groups of addresses under the same control.  Then the police don't need to "prove" anything, they'll use the suspicion to obtain a search warrant/pressure your supplier/trick you into a revealing statement. "Plausible deniability" is going to be a tough sell to a jury of your peers, who assume that you wouldn't be sitting in a courtroom if you were innocent.
As I wrote above, to be safe "you should still operate under the assumption that BTC transactions are traceable".

From reading the test case, it appears that the software had 20 50k coins in the wallet and was instructed to make a 500k payment.  Instead of spending exactly 10 of the coins to make 500k, a rounding error of some sort caused the wallet software to use 11 coins as input, creating the desired 500k output plus an additional 50k "change" output.  So the bug was that more coins than strictly necessary were used as input.

Wow.  Putting all the funds in one wallet, even temporarily, seems incredibly irresponsible.
That's opening up all the cold wallets, putting everything on-line, and then really really hoping that all your security ducks are in a row and your code is Bug Free (tm) and nothing goes wrong.
I personally would be a lot more confident in Bitstamp if they had performed the audit in reasonably-sized chunks.  It takes a little more blockchain work, but you could show possession of N cold wallets one at a time, and then show that none of them were used as inputs into another of the validating transactions.  That way if something goes wrong in the process you don't immediately lose 100% of your customers' funds.

And note that he's already under investigation by the FBI (for Silk Road) and by FinCEN, and those seized assets were listed in the leaked crisis doc (and in public FBI documents in the case of the FBI's Silk Road seizure) -- so no gag order there.  Any hypothetical gag order would have to be by a different investigation over some other case.  The only thing that comes close in US law is a National Security Letter ( -- but again, we know that the FBI did not use an NSL for the Silk Road stuff, because they've published information about their seizure.

No, they don't conflict with each other because Gox created them with different sending addresses (which is stupid, but that's how their wallet dealt with retransmission).  So they aren't double-spends, but they are transfers of the same amount to the same destination.  Depending on how the TM attack worked, the earlier one would probably have characteristics which "real" gox transactions never did -- for example, it would have a signature which is one byte shorter than normal for GOX, indicating that there was a leading zero which was 'corrected' by the attacker.  Or else it would have one of the 'strange' push operators in the bytecode, which gox never emits normally.
So it's not trivial to detect, but the evidence would be there.

They used the txid as the primary key in their database.  Any change to a transaction alters the txid.  So they queried the blockchain for the txid they authored, but never saw the "corrected" tx with a different txid.  This wouldn't be a problem if the reissued tx used the same inputs -- the blockchain would reject it as a double spend.  But when they automatically reissued the tx, it used different inputs, so *both* the 'corrected' original tx *and* the reissued tx could go through.

Furthermore, a recent paper shows that you can sometimes (not often, but occasionally) associate specific IP addresses with a bitcoin address if you watch the peer-to-peer traffic closely.  So, BTC is 100% traceable, and it is *pseudonymous* not *anonymous*.  You must be careful to protect your pseudonym, because once it is known (either by IP leak or because you got busted in the real world doing something shady), all of your transactions come home to roost.
(Bitcoin mixing services attempt to make transactions less traceable.  But they are not perfect; a government-size actor can probably infer quite a lot by the size and timing of the transactions.  For example, if you put 1BTC into the mixer, look at all transaction with (1BTC-mixer fees) out within (maximum mixer delay).  You can complicate this analysis by using multiple outputs, but there's a limit on how many outputs the mixer allows and they must still sum to your inputs.  With enough computing power some very good hypotheses can be made.  By all means use a mixing service, but you should still operate under the assumption that BTC transactions are traceable.  Protect your pseudonym!)

What if it's both lost *and* stolen?  That is, the admin-level hacker could have stolen 25k BTC in 2011 *plus* scrambled or deleted the wallet keys for ~700k more.  Perhaps this was even unintentional, as they wiped a hard disk to erase logs and cover their tracks.
Or they used the stolen user/password database in 2011 to obtain key material for various accounts, and then gradually exploited this material afterwards to siphon off ~500 BTC/day.  MtGox apparently automatically resends transactions which are faulty; perhaps the slow theft caused double-spends which were automatically 'fixed' by MtGox without fully realizing what was going on.
These could be combined; the attacker could have stolen the key material *and* scrambled what was recorded at MtGox.  So just because the coins are still sitting in "MtGox's" account, they are actually controlled by the thief.  It's not surprising they're still mostly sitting there; it's hard to liquidate 700k BTC (and what would you spend it on?).  In fact, since MtGox was probably monitoring the public addresses, the thief probably had a motive to not move the funds to avoid suspicion for as long as possible.  (Including up to the present time -- if we saw a bunch of those 424k bitcoins moving suddenly in late February we'd certainly start a massive effort to track where they go!)
Or there was a N-of-M secret sharing scheme going on, and the thief made off with/destroyed enough of the shares that neither MtGox *nor* the thief can move the funds without cooperating.  Probably neither of them would actually destroy the shares they control, in the vain hope that somehow they can obtain enough of the others...

Let's pretend the key was numeric.  I'm searching all the keys with largest character `0` first -- that's just 0000.  Then all the keys with largest character `1`: 1000 0100 0010 0001 1100 1010 1001 0110 0101 0011 1110 1101 1011 0111.  Then all the keys where `2` is the largest character: 2000 2001 2010 2011 2100 2101 2110 2111 0200 0201 etc.
That way I search exactly as much keyspace is required, based on the largest character present in the key.  Of course, this is all moot if the largest character present is 0xF15A (the bitcoin symbol), since that will take decades regardless.  But if the largest character is still is ISO-8859-1 I will get there eventually.

Well, TBI is now retracting his post and sitting on this documents.  So this leak might be the only accurate information we have about what's going on.
FWIW, there are at least a few things which check out here:
1. "a post came up on reddit, a user showed how he was able to use transaction mailability to receive more coins from mtgox than he was entitled to" -- see 
2. "Second, Teo-Bit Idiot is in the know and has known for years, he is one of us." -- which is a plausible explanation for why TBI folded and is going to sit on his documents.
3. "We do not plan to resign or shit down the foundation at this time."  ... certainly seems to be the case.
And what doesn't check out:
1. "Mark he let us know that he was now missing close to a million bitcoins." -- the recent leaked database dump doesn't really seem to confirm this number, although it's too early to be sure.  The listed "BTC balance" is 951,116 (which is "close to a million") so I guess this would check out if MtGox really had only ~2,000 BTC left as the earlier "strategy" leak said.  Recent events seem to indicate that Mark has control over more BTC than this.  Of course, Mark could have been lying to everyone...

"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't open my books for you at all because you might see the DPR account" is much more convenient than "I can show you details on every account but one; here, let me do a bunch of work to redact the smallest amount possible so you can see how stupid I was".

I'm curious about a protocol thing: there are a *lot* of transactions to this address now.  To move the funds from this donation address will require a bitcoin transaction with a huge number (~2000?) of inputs (since inputs reference a certain transaction, not an address).  Is there a precedent?  How large can bitcoin transactions typically get?
Having read the protocol, it seems like it is also possible to collect the funds in a tree of transactions, where each one collects M inputs from the previous set of transactions.  So I guess even if tx size is limited this won't "break bitcoin".
But I still wonder how usual this case is: thousands of transactions over the past month of protocol traffic.
