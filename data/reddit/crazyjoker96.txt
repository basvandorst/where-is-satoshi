Thanks so much, so I can put the QR on it and it's wallet address?
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:49:49
Ai, I'm sorry, I got so badly, thanks a lot

Ehi man, thanks for your Beautiful explanation
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:51:40
Thanks man, which the site explorer use the script for trace bitcoins? &lt;sig&gt; &lt;pubKeyHash&gt; in this example the public key hash is the hash256(hash256(publicKey)) right?
@_date: 2019-11-30 00:10:58
Yes man, thanks so much
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:34:42
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:56:17
Sorry, this is my error, yes this is a system for mixing, right?
@_date: 2019-11-29 12:52:21
What is the difference to coinbase-pro?
@_date: 2019-11-24 11:47:10


@_date: 2019-11-29 12:51:43
:) yes. No dugs YES liberty
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:04:52
I understand, but with an example.
If I buy the bitcoin on coinbase and I mixing these, the coinbase has a reference to me that I buy X bitcoin, and I don't want this
@_date: 2019-03-11 23:16:28
thanks so muck, tomorrow I will work on
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:07:24
I have the Bitcoin with bought on coinbase but now I want to buy the Bitcoin without my reference
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:31:38
Thanks for finding the method for me
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:27:34
Hi Pieter, thanks for your answer, so I can say that this enum class contains all actual transaction standard except for the TX\_NULL\_DATA and TX\_NONSTANDARD?
@_date: 2019-10-28 08:39:49
Yeah, the P2MS in the chart not is a script P2SH but is a script with OP\_CHECKMULTISIG how last OP\_CODE.
I will add the other script in this week and I will update the post
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:56:21
oh sorry now I understand the your idea, sorry my English, yes I will add the P2SH for moment the data of the script wasn't painted
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:52:29
Thanks so much
@_date: 2019-10-28 08:50:45
Oh good information, I was haven't know the information on the armony client.
But yes I had to add information on the form of the script.
In the many cases in the chart is noted used the blockchain for store data with OP\_RETUNR and with only hex data inside the script (cataloged how NO\_STANDARD).
I don't think in the past the script is more different and more person hasn't used the complex script.
Also for the actual script, NO\_STADARD (Not included in the chart) is more interesting to create an chart with the different type, an example:
* Script for peg-in/peg-out in the side blockchain.
* Script for lightning network.
@_date: 2019-10-28 08:55:51
Oh yes, this is an good chart for understanding the different.
For calculating the P2SH not spend with the parser of data BLK I need to implement the UTXO cache, for a moment not is a priority for me, but in interesting extract from data the information to utilizing of blockchain with the script.
An example if want to build a graph of  address, I a good not give the ScriptPubKey with the OP\_RETURN, but is necessary to create an complete parser of script
@_date: 2019-10-15 22:35:37
good news, thanks for this work
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:14:45
The multi-signature script
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:43:07
So, Is better Join the P2MS with P2SH?! when I increse the analysis,p this is only version alpha. Thanks for your help
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:01:48
Unfortunately, the money that should make with Bitcoin is more important of the progress of technology with blockchain.
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:57:07
This is a good question, so I'm cataloging the Script PubKey with these criteria:
* P2MS is a script that has last OP\_CODE how CHECKMULTISIG.
* P2SH is a script has the first OP\_CODE how OP\_HASH160.
The analysis of P2SH is interesting and I'm think for analysis it needs to analisis a Script Sig, [my question correlated with]( this argument on Bitcoin stackexchange](
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:56:29
Thank for your answer, I have read more documentation and the bitcoinbook also I have read the code bitcoin core and I have created a parser of the file blk for my thesis project.
So my question is only clarification on my definition.
@_date: 2019-10-03 10:03:10
Thie reasons can re-enter inside my second point, right?
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:04:20
Nice, thanks for your work
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:00:21
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:00:56
you are genius man :)
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:40:35
Thanks so much, if you want to build the project on the Linux or OSX you can use my answer on [this issue](
@_date: 2019-12-14 10:32:57
Thanks, with the serialization JSON, is possible to know all information inside the transaction; is possible to write the personal analisis with [AnalyticsPyBlock]( if you want to write a personal analysis with it, please send me the PR with this analisis or if you want to talk with me to create it.
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:06:35
there are two options:
\- Or you are a lucky man (for $82 for hours)
\- Or you are a man that likes to pay for your good work. (I think this! :-) )
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:35:47
Oh! I will see your project; I want implementation inside my parser a system for store transaction deserialized.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:50:14
What is mean?
@_date: 2019-12-14 10:28:14
Thanks so much :)
@_date: 2019-12-13 21:42:27
Thanks, if you want to test the SpyCBlock and you want more information on "how to configure it" can you sent me a message.
I'm thinking to open an IRC channel

@_date: 2019-01-08 22:52:42
Thanks, you've been very helpful, I am a new in this context, I'm learning
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:50:00
Thanks, now I will look
@_date: 2019-01-17 19:52:03
yes, I reading a that book
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:50:41
Thanks, you've been very helpful, I would create a parser for blockchain to creating a graf
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:49:30

@_date: 2019-09-02 13:56:11
Yea but are more util for learning, do can you give me a link for the cheap usb miner? also can you give me an reference for configure the bfgminer for mining on testnet in the local machine?
@_date: 2019-09-02 13:44:49
Thanks, so I can mining on test with the normal pc?
@_date: 2019-09-02 19:57:50
I also have the possibility to extract with the GPU, can you give me a reference to configure a software?
@_date: 2019-09-03 18:43:53
Thanks so much man :)
@_date: 2019-09-16 12:20:19
I too want the my Bitcoin QR murales :)
