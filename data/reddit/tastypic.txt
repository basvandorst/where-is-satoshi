Earning profits is not a bad thing, but the way in which GS has earned their profits has been immoral and illegal. Sec fraud, undervaluing ipos, insider trading. The list goes on and on.

To be fair, even though ASICS are prevalent, the creation of new coins are at the same rate.  About 25 every 10 minutes.  
Vinny @ Gyft had it right - there are more merchants who are accepting Bitcoin than people who are spending it. This creates selling pressure. Every purchase made through a payment processor like Gyft or bitpay, shorts Bitcoin slightly.  
It will take time to gain adopters, but we shouldn't pressure them with promises of wealth; rather convenience and application.  
I was shocked when bitcoin dipped below 650. That was the peak of the bubble before 1200. If bitcoin drops below 250 (the peak of the bubble prior), then I will panic. That would mean that many people who believed in Bitcoin before it was huge does no longer.  I truly hope that doesn't happen.

He claims he had a way to sell them. Even if he did, he'd be going against the very ideas he promotes in his speeches. If he's such a believer in Bitcoin, why would he be selling 550 btc, or as he claims it, majority of his btc wealth, at sub 300 prices?

I don't agree with returning in dollars. If a customer gives 1 btc for a purchase, and return the item, they should get 1 btc back, regardless of the value. 
This puts risk on the company, so, to reduce that risk, the company can cash out 50% of the Bitcoin immediately, and store the other 50% in a wallet for 30 days, or whatever the return policy allows for. If less than half of Bitcoin customers return their goods, there will be a large enough pool to cover returns. 
An advanced look at this would be to develop software (or use existing) that will keep track of Bitcoin 's value when a purchase is made, and once the return window expires AND the value of Bitcoin is &gt;= the value when the purchase is made, cash out. 
Risky for a business now due to volatility? Maybe, but the volume of Bitcoin transactions will be low enough that I don't think it will hurt the bottom line.

Apparently there's a lot of Coinbase fans.
The most important thing to realize is that Coinbase is neither an exchange nor a wallet.  They make money off everything you choose to do with them, and they control how you do it. They can cancel anything they want if it doesn't make sense to them financially. 
I'm based in the US, but I use bitstamp, or meet people in my community.  Depending on where you live, you might be surprised how much easier, and anonymous it is to trade with locals. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:23:39
That statement was really more of a conclusion to what I posted as a whole. 
The big picture is that this would be a temporary solution, that may not be the right fit as the volume of Bitcoin transactions increase significantly. 
The only way this could hurt the bottom line is if 1)Bitcoin value crashes and doesn't ever recover. Or takes a long time to recover. 2)Funds being held for the return window are technically looked at as loss due to interest on the company's 'loan'. (I don't know how to better explain this, but technically if Bitcoin are being held, the company is losing money on the cost of the materials/services provided.  Or they'll have to get a loan, with interest, to cover it). It can be combated partly with charging a restocking fee on applicable returns. This will also be reduced by the smaller fees associated with accepting Bitcoin. 
All of this just gave me a really good idea, but I think I'll save it for a more appropriate topic.

It look like people are still answering questions, so I'll take a stab about something that's been worrying me. 
I use multibit (old version like 2012) for my cold storage. I generated about 30 addresses for the wallet and I've only made about 10 transactions.  It is in an encrypted true crypt volume (old version as well) on a cold computer.  
When I try to move out of cold storage, multibit attempts to download months of the blockchain, but I don't want my system to be online that long. So... 
I reset the blockchain and transactions with multibit and I can send immediately, and I do. Then I close multibit, unmount the volume and go offline. 
By doing this am I putting my wallet at risk of corruption or something that would cause my wallet to be unusable? 
I would love to have armory and just sign offline, but I don't have the physical resources to do so. 
Any help would be appreciated.  
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:32:23
Depends on what you mean by secure. Coinbase is an exchange and payment processor, not a wallet. I only store my coins on blockchain and cold storage. Coinbase stores your private key, so that can be seen as a security flaw, or at the very least, requiring faith in them as a whole.

Statistically speaking a lone miner has the same probability of solving the block on the FIRST calculation as a pool, right? Now of course, that doesn't mean it's a good idea, and over time it's completely unrealistic, but technically true for the first calculation, right? 
Another question is do all miners start at the same calculation, or are they random until they find the solution? If not, could you program your software to start calculating at X calculations ahead of everyone else to get a head start? 
I know a good amount about Bitcoin, but mining is still extremely confusing. :(

For that amount you don't really need to wait for Confirmations. If they have a copy of that wallet on their drive, the moment you leave they can switch the funds to another wallet and you're out. Not to mention they might inject malware on the flash drive and wait to clear you out. 
Might as well just have them send it via the blockchain.

It is centralized.  The exchange and apps, however, are not.  POS is something cryptocurrency hasn't seen much of.  But when all of the units are pre-distributed to 73 people whose job it is to distribute it out, that is centralization and a big problem.  
Another big problem is their promotion that a built-in brain wallet is a positive. Time and time again it's been proven that it's not. 
Lastly, nxt is not fully open source, and they just don't have the community backing like bitcoin does. Flag after flag, no thanks.

I doubt the etf will go through. I could be wrong. But having seen the market for 6ish years, I can tell you that bitcoin will go lower than where we are now. I'm even willing to bet a bitcoin that it'll drop below $1k within 6 months. That's a costly bet if I'm wrong. I'm totally bullish on bitcoin long-term, but not short-term. 
When I say sell, I don't mean all your holdings, just a percentage. I will never sell all my bitcoin.

The thing is, no one is ever able to spot a bubble until it pops. But it always does. Btc might go up another hundred max, but it will fall again. It always does. Sell, take your gains and wait. Something something buy when others are fearful, sell when others are hopeful.

I appreciate where you're coming from, but if you can't recognize short-term trends, you haven't been paying attention. Analytics on the bitcoin market exists, and they're damn accurate. Don't buy the news, buy the trends. I have been watching the market since 2010 and it is mostly predictable. 
Let's say the etf goes through and bitcoin jumps to $1400-1500, then what? Do you know what is actually driving the price? It's not China, it's not an etf - those are distractions. You really have to look deep on what moves the price. I'm no oracle, but the bottom will fall out and it will be this year - etf or no.

Just an idea about 'investing' in btc. I bought 1k worth last week and it went up an astounding $100 since and I would only make $200 if I sold now (minus capital gains tax of 25%).

I've been in it since 2011 myself. I noted close to zero in my original post because I don't believe it will ever hit zero as long as people are still holding, like myself. 
But if someone asked me two years ago when bitcoin was at $1100+ if there were any risks involved, I'd say the same thing. It dropped below $400 shortly after. In op's case he'd be out $7k or more. Is that a drop to zero? No not technically, but I'm sure he'd be pretty pissed if I didn't warn him it could happen. 
@_date: 2016-12-21 08:27:12

Hmm let's say the cryptography bitcoin is based on has an NSA backdoor - sure it can be hard forked, but by then it will surely crash. Let's say Satoshi decides to dump his 1 million+ btc on an exchange. Let's say there is some fatal coding error that is found (see ethereum DAO). There are lots of hypothetical doomsday scenarios that are all pretty unlikely, until they happen.
I am quite the bitcoin fanboy but I don't like to advertise it without mentioning the inherent risks when someone is looking to buy more than they can afford to lose.

It depends over what timeline you sell. There is currently $2.5B of trading volume a day. And the price has been going exponentially up. As long as you don't attempt to sell them all at once you can keep the value stable. It's not like you suddenly created more bitcoin.

I have some questions about the upcoming potential hard fork. I am limited in understanding when it comes to the logistics of a hard fork. 
If the consensus is split 60/40 (or worse 50/50) what determines which chain my coins go to? Wallet software? Does it exist on both chains? Are they spendable on both chains? Can I go back and forth on chains? Does it invalidate my coins completely? What would I need to do if I thought the 40 chain is better and what I want to use? 
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:52:33
Yea that's how the scheme works. They expect you to test small transactions, and pay you out, then you send them 5 btc and bam you never hear from them again. I bet that's a hacked PP account and they probably use Google phone.

You may be new here, so before the trolls come and slaughter you, I'd recommend to search this sub for coinbase. There are a ton of threads that answer this question. 
The main point to know is that coinbase isn't designed as a wallet - it's an exchange. Only leave money and bitcoin that you can afford to lose, because coinbase holds your private keys. They also trace your transactions and have been known to shut down accounts for 'suspicious' activity. As an exchange, it's great, but as a wallet - look elsewhere.

Serious answer here - if you are familiar with bitcoin, you can send a very small amount to the public address with a note "please note that I have access to your funds - move your balance in 60 days or I will take it" or something like that. 
If you aren't that familiar with bitcoin, you can send me the *public key* and I'll do it for you. That'll give you 60 days at least to learn how to move the funds on your own.

All crypto price action reasons are a conspiracy then. There are no fundamentals. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:35:34
Ive had a few problems with Gyft, but overall a good experience. The one thing the app doesn't state until you buy is if the card is redeemable online, in store, or both. I bought a CVS only to find out it's online only. Support was great and refunded me. 
The app is meh on Android. When you first boot it, make sure to let it sync BEFORE you do anything, or it will crash. When paying, just copy paste the address into your wallet app - or it will crash. 
Other than that, I have easily bought close to 2k in gift cards. Amazon, red Robin, regal, Belk, sears, McCormick and schmicks, fandango. 
The only other problem I've had is retailers not knowing how to accept it-very YMMV. Red Robin needs a manager to approve it. McCormick and schmicks was a nightmare! My buddy and I had a $150 tab and they said they can only accept it if it's printed?! We had to use the manager's computer to print a copy - so dumb. 
Overall a little hassle is no big deal, you just have to stand firm when paying as many people dismiss it quickly.

Bitpay and Coinbase immediately exchanges the Bitcoin to dollars, so there's no risk to the merchant.

I want to be able to see charts for longer time frames. Most only do a week. Up to a year would help. Also like someone else said, having the ability to switch exchanges easily. Bitcoinity.org does this flawlessly.

Yea but I imagine prices will rise.

Hey, don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin, but if you're supporting a family, I'm not sure Bitcoin is a safe investment for 100% of your income. I would gladly take 25% of my take home pay in Bitcoin - that's what I can afford to lose.

There is a ton of circle-jerking going on in those comments. I'm not even going to spend my time arguing with them.

Thanks for the reply. 
I meant that CVS is in-store only. I wasn't able to use it online, and there are no B&amp;M locations in my state.

In a format that's watchable on mobile. I missed out on all the ones that weren't posted on youtube.

They have had 2fA for a long time. It's called a yubikey. There's no excuse for not having one.

It has to be a fresh install, preferably on a hard drive that has never been connected to the Internet, but a full wipe will generally suffice. You won't be connecting it to the Internet, and once you create the wallet you should encrypt the files, back up the volumes, and physically destroy the hard drives. 
Ideally.

That woman is such a cunt. Every single fucking day she says something sensationally stupid about Bitcoin.

The problem I've always had with Ubuntu is that it's Linux. I'm pretty God damned computer proficient, but when it comes to Linux, it's too much. I attempted cold storage on an old p4 with an Ubuntu boot disc, but even with research I couldn't do it. 
I ended up using a fresh Windows xp install, and it was fine. 
Tl;Dr Linux is hard if you haven't been taught it, but a fresh install of xp works fine for cold sto
rage.

I hate Walmart, but you can buy gift cards to it on eGifter. Too bad their app doesn't work on my s4.

Do I have to worry about my private keys that I encrypted with truecrypt?

I'm pretty sure there's a video where she drinks her own piss.
