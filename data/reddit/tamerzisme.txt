Yes, I thought exactly as you. I ran without the port open because I figured what could it hurt? At least it is something. After he posted that, I opened up the port or don't run it at all.
@_date: 2014-04-28 17:16:37
You don't think he thought of that before saying directly that it is part of the problem?

Been thinking of building a home ESXi server. This pushed me over the edge. Ordered!
EDIT: Of course they screwed it up. The BitPay receipt shows paid, but then I get two emails from NewEgg saying payment was declined.
Here is the helpful suggestion from support chat:


@_date: 2014-07-01 17:32:44
Possibly. However, the link on my order status page to BitPay's site shows "This invoice has been paid."
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:02:42
I sent a small amount to make sure everything is working:
It has been 4 confirmations yet my dashboard says I have 0 balance still:




EDIT: It ended up showing once I was at about 8 confirmations. Not sure why it says 3.

I'm going to go ahead and agree with the guy that actually writes the software instead of you.

Green Man Gaming is a legit company and they often have coupons that let you get Steam codes for less than Steam. So there probably is some truth in this. I'm not saying it is fine in this particular case.

Card companies charge the business high fees. Those then either get passed on to you, or the business doesn't stay open very long. $5 theaters aren't usually bringing in the big bucks.

I guess he is getting a free $5 since I'm not filling out forms to withdraw that much.

It is not helpful:

Thanks. I just sent an email. The person I talked to on the phone was very nice but she couldn't seem to get any answers. She told me she would email me when she heard back from accounting.

I've been holding for years but it was too hard not to sell at least some when it went over $1100.
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:13:28
I hope I am explaining this correctly. I'm sure I'll be corrected if wrong.
Each transaction takes up a certain amount of space that varies. When a transaction happens, it goes into a pool of every other new transaction. In a way, each transaction is waiting for a miner to put their transaction in a block, then solve that block. Since each block only has so much room, miners will take the transactions with the highest fees first since it is in their interest. They don't have to, it just makes financial sense.
So you could put a no fee transaction in, and if it wasn't competing with other transactions, it would probably get added to a block. But there are lots of transactions that have fees that will be chosen first.

I guess I wasn't clear. The idea is to buy it back lower. I'm just watching to see where this one bottoms.

Oh wow, this page still works: 
@_date: 2012-12-11 19:57:22
I bought knowing this is exactly what would happen. Not excusing it, but I went through the same thing with the FPGA Single and them. It took way longer than promised, but once it showed up, it worked great.
@_date: 2012-10-12 21:13:25
This article is a year old. Who knows how much the policies have changed since then.
@_date: 2012-10-05 21:59:11


That is assuming the price stays the same. It is also possible the price will double when the difficulty does. The truth is, nobody has any idea.
When I bought my BFL Single, I think 1 BTC was only worth about $6. Now it is double that.
@_date: 2011-10-28 00:58:48
The advantage is that it can't be inflated.
@_date: 2017-05-11 13:47:03
I sold some hoping to buy back at a dip. Instead it just keeps climbing. Sad for the few I sold, happy for the ones I didn't.
@_date: 2015-03-01 09:50:21
It did break even. I ended up mining as much in USD than I paid in USD. So in my case it broke even. Literally. Could I have made more if I just bought Bitcoin instead of the miner with my cash? Of course. But if I knew for a fact that would be the case, I'd be a billionaire.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:46:58
My BFL FPGA did really well, even after being late as all hell. The ASIC's however came so late they barely broke even.
I have no idea why anyone would have ordered the Monarch's after all the horrible delays with the other products.
@_date: 2015-02-17 04:40:23


Typical, blame the whistleblower, not the criminals.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:04:50
They said they are following the 1/3'rd plan but only for first month orders:
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:23:57
My FPGA BFL single has paid for itself twice over. ASIC's are delayed, but BFL is certainly legit.
@_date: 2013-06-18 21:50:36
Never waited eagerly for homework before.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:21:39
I wasn't aware you could do that. Excellent idea then.
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:18:11
For less than $1500, your only choice is BFL. Who knows how long it will take to actually get one.

I like how you censor out the IP address twice but leave the one at the bottom in the footer.
Cloudflare is who they are using to handle DDOS attacks. It is possible that they blocked your whole IP subnet due to attacks from other IP's on it.

What good would all the coins sitting in their account do? It doesn't really effect the market at all, people would just use the coins that are out there. The only way it would is if they started dumping them.
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:54:16
I know the feeling. I believe I could have built one as well, but I don't believe I could build a *secure* one. At least not secure enough for me to be comfortable.
@_date: 2013-03-06 16:06:42
They would print more money to do a 51% attack most likely.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:40:22
But it can go the other way too. Mining can be a safer bet. If the price of Bitcoin goes up, well at least you are mining them. If the price of Bitcoin goes down, difficulty should stay lower and you end up with more coins.
Buying and holding has been the winning strategy so far, but nobody can see the future.
@_date: 2013-03-09 01:48:00
Still have time before difficulty jumps.
@_date: 2013-03-08 17:52:43
I've been mining for a while now, and all of the hardware has more than paid for itself. Now it is pretty much pure profit. Not that I make a lot, but I'm mining about 0.2 BTC every day. At today's prices, that is not too shabby.

@_date: 2013-04-13 20:04:33
@_date: 2013-03-26 17:16:22
Why didn't they do that with FPGA's?
@_date: 2013-10-06 23:07:38
Today I learned. Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-01-31 00:25:37
Typically you just need to swap the power cable. Most computer PSU's can handle a range of 120 - 240 V.
@_date: 2013-03-08 23:15:10
I would not recommend GPU's now for the reason you mention. But if BFL really does get their act together, the Jalepeno's are only $150. It is only a matter of time before other companies come out with similar hardware and things start to become very competitive.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:08:08
The devices will get cheaper and cheaper so you will scale horizontally.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:59:01
You appear to trust an online site a lot more than I do. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the site, but there is no way to know if they are storing those created private keys or not. I doubt it, but why would you trust it?
@_date: 2013-02-16 01:18:46
I lost on the exact same bet.
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:54:58
I just have two HD6970 video cards which do about 750 - 775 MH/sec (total for both) and a Butterfly Labs Bitforce Single FPGA which does around 800 MH/sec.
@_date: 2013-10-08 16:21:38
Now double the length, add a few more PCIe connectors, and have a 4 slot leaf blower on it and you will know what the final product looks like.
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:07:17
Yes! Better than finding a $20 in your pocket.

I like how I'm down voted for this, yet I don't see anyone posting where I can get an ASIC for less. If there is another place I can get an ASIC for under $1500, please let me know.
@_date: 2013-09-15 04:04:59
I've bought one thing there before and overall it was a good experience.

But it is better to use the -datadir option in this situation.

They were only $1299 for the first batch. Second batch was $1500. Who knows how much the 3rd batch will be.

He is talking about the ordering site ( not the article site.

He is not CEO. I believe he may be COO though.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:02:23
Don't get me wrong, I am not defending the horrible way they have handled this. But I just know I went through the same thing with the FPGA. It shipped months after it was supposed to. But then it arrived, and it works perfectly. Churns out 800 MH/s all day long with hardly any power usage.
I think they will be successful. The question is... will they be successful any time soon?
EDIT: Also, it is a no brainer to do the trade in. If I didn't have that option, I may not have jumped on this.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:47:05
The bubbles are huge milestones that need to be included. No doubt they drew a lot of attention to Bitcoin.

Why wouldn't you do that? Oh... that didn't work out so well for most people.

I placed a trade-in preorder in October. Hoping they actually release by the end of next month. Looks like the Avalon orders are now going out in mass so hash rate should start jumping soon.

I'm in the same boat. I'm selling it as I'm mining it. Waiting for a crash to buy some up. Hopefully will actually have my ASIC before that point.
@_date: 2013-11-06 18:21:25
Yeah, I know the site is well regarded. Good to know it is as simple as running it offline.
