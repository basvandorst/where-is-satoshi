No, people with money are targets for bitcoin.

Okay, you want to make a bet that bitcoin will not be worth $6,000 by the end of this year? 
Someone doesn't understand that merchants selling Bitcoin are the cause for driving the price down. Bubble within the next few days? Keep dreaming.

So what makes this game relate to Bitcoin? 
All I see here is a tiny bitcoin logo on the side of the ship and the name of the website. Other than that the game needs  a lot of work if you plan to monetize it. 
You're better off posting your game on a website like  for more exposure.

Nobody cares if gays or straights invest. We just care that you invest. It's like asking "Do you black people invest? " Who cares.

Let's be real here, nothing indicates the price will reach that high this year. Previous performances are not indcators of what will happen in the future.  
Now if you gave me a number between $900-1,500 by the end of this year I'd be in the same boat as you.

Anytime there is a 10-15% spike in BTC price the BITCOINZ $1,000,000 BY THE END OF MONTHz crowd comes and fills the reddit with their silly post.

Since I can't find it anywhere using google, what would the fundamental problems be for Bitshare? Like what would stop it from gaining mass adoption or any serious flaws it may have? (like the 51% attack for bitcoin) 
If you have links or articles explaining any problems with it's system please share. I'm considering donating, it sounds like a promising idea.

The majority of those people are below the age of 18, don't have a bank account and most likely only have an understanding of economics based on a high school level or less.
They're not a target group for Bitcoin at the moment.  Maybe as they get older they'll understand the value Bitcoin has for society.

I've seen post with Fukpaypal saying some really stupid shit.  It's annoying and unrealistic but I guess it's okay to dream.  Perhaps we should create an r/BitcoinSpeculate to get them off the main reddit.

That's because Coinbase, a private company requires you to VERIFY your account before they allow you to use their services fully. If you don't like use another company, no one is forcing you to use Coinbase. You're spreading lies by making it seem as if Coinbase is trying to fuck their customers when they are actually looking out for their customers best interest.

Average Joe that knows nothing about Bitcoin: 
Get's to his front door, sees flyer. 
Thinks to himself "Glad I wasn't home when Jehova's witnesses knocked.." Throws flyer in the trash without looking at it.
Sadly, I think this is what's going to happen to most of them.

The interest these bitcoins have generated for me is higher than any fiat bank would ever hope to match. Regardless of what the bitcoin price will ultimately be.This form of lending is for people who are going long term and rather have their bitcoin doing something other than sitting in a wallet. 
Edit: Let's say the market value of bitcoin drops, and you invested 0.10/BTC and are set to gain 10% interest. You're still pegged to get 0.01 coins in interest. You "lost" if you decide to exchange your 0.01 for USD immediately. But for someone who has no intention of immediately selling their BTC for USD there is no lost. 
If your goal is to make USD off bitcoin lending now is not the time, come back in a few years.

I have bought all my Bitcoin from Coinbase, never had a problem. (I did get labeled high risk when I tried purchasing coins once. Contacted customer service, got white listed in less than 12 hours.)
@_date: 2014-08-26 23:43:02
I saw this comparison  and it makes me wonder, maybe there's a little more too it.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:31:11
The max you should ever put into one borrower is 0.10 BTC, and as Bitcoin gains value, less.

I hope we can opt out of this. As an investor, I deliberately keep my information on BtC JAM nonexistent for a reason.
@_date: 2014-08-17 08:57:36
You forgot a step (lending). 
Which has given me 40-50% returns on my coins. I'll be stuck on this step for a while.

I'm considering buying some bitshares..wait a little a longer or go in before it goes even higher?

Do what I did, place bets at BitBet.us. I doubled 0.5 BTC I use for play money. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 03:35:18
bitfinex returns consistenly stay below 15% for me..btcjam has given me the latter.

You don't lend 1 bitcoin to one person. You lend 0.05-0.10 bitcoin to 10 different people with ratings of C+ and above with a history of paying back their debt. This is how you make a profit.
The only people I see losing money are the greedy.

Hello, I've looked everywhere to understand how I can invest and understand Petamine but sadly all I find is a bit too complicated for me. Can anyone explain to me how Petamining works and how I can invest into it? 
Links and articles as well if you have them! Thanks
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:59:17
Greed plays a major role, and I think you're at fault for putting 0.30btc into one borrower. Spread your investment, if you're lending to people with ratings of C- just because they are offering 25% returns, it's pretty clear cut that the chances of them defaulting is high.
Try to avoid lending to people with new accounts or people with ratings of C and below. I always lend B- or above with the occasional C+(borrower whom has a history of paying back their debts), and to this day I've never had a person default on me.(Been with BTCJam since January.)
Yes people with higher ratings tend to give less interest, but keep in mind it's more than any bank or CD would give you and in the the long run it's less risk for you.

Not surprising that Bitcoin will attract these folks. As long as they're buying and selling BTC right?

The main reason it's trading volume comes from chinese exchanges(bter and btc38) is because they are the only two exchanges where BTSX is available at the moment. It will be available in other exchanges in September.

Totally agree with OP. I've been with Bitcoin for a couple months now, and I'm certainly no smart techy dude. But, every time I see an "I've lost X BTC thread", I check all my accounts out of sheer paranoia. 
Now imagine what it does to a new person browsing the forum.

What do you gain from open carry other than it being dick measuring contest? 
If I'm a bad guy and I see you open carrying, I'm going to wait until you're turned away and know exactly what to go for, and I'm sure as hell are going to able to take it because every single guy I've seeing open carrying is morbidly obese or look like they don't hit the gym at all. 
Concealed is the way to go. Don't make yourself a target.
