You didnt source anything or really say anything to rebut his view on technical analysis other than take a condescending tone and say plenty of people use it. Yes, every major financial institution has a department. But that only feeds into one of the major TA critiques (that it is a self-fufilling prophecy) and is an appeal to authority at best. They don't get better returns than those using fundamentals and neither them nor you can properly explain how those mathematics and analysis techniques tie into human behavior in any remotely scientific way

Watch the interview. He literally says it right after he is asked.

@_date: 2017-10-17 23:20:16
You're ignorant as fuck. And if you had followed WL before 2015 this would be blatantly clear. Read their last two AMAs. When was their last PGP signed release? Why is their twitter threatening journalists about russia releases? What happened to this huge juicy russia leak from 7 years ago?
How come most of the important and top voted questions (dealing with WL and Julian's integrity) on their last couple AMAs have been ignored? How come they refuse to release any important (not already publicly available and manicured for release) leaks about Russia? 
Remember this gilded and top voted question that was avoided on his AMA?
"Thanks for taking questions. Here's mine: 
Why did Wikileaks [omit]( an email from release detailing a transfer of &amp;gt;€2bn (~$2.4bn) from Assad's regime in Syria to a state-owned Russian bank in 2012?
Furthermore, why did Wikileaks threaten retaliation against journalists that reported on this omission?"
I am baffled at your confidence in Julian and WL. 
Oh, and to top things off Julian is a rapist. 'American values'. HA
I am disappointed as fuck in this sub. It has gone to absolute shit. 
edit: More American Values for you, kid. 
Another unanswered question to Julian:
In 2010 you [thanked]( people for donating money to help decrypt the "Collateral Murder" video after having [sollicited]( donations for "supercomputer time."
PFC Manning [claims]( that the video was "was never really encrypted." Her [court martial proceedings]( confirm that.
I know you can't confirm or deny anything regarding Manning, but do you stand by your claim that the video you received was encrypted and that you depended on donations to decript it? Secondly, how importantly do you value honesty when it comes to fundraising?
*Some additional light reading for you*

Not sure how that happened. Looks completely different on mobile.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:12:33
Just a gentle reminder:
Julian Assange is a rapist and WL is compromised and biased towards the Russian government. Read their last 2 AMAs. Look at the unanswered questions. Look for their last PGP signed release. Look at the unexplained hash mismatches. Look at Assange's personal incentives and why working with Russia might be beneficial to his well-being. Look at the change in their twitter habits from 2015-6 onward. Tweeting links to conspiracy websites. What happened to that huge Russia leak from 2010 that never came? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:08:25
lmao. I couldnt write this shit.
is a complete fraud of a subreddit. This is addressed in the AMA that you couldnt link me too (because what you claimed was on there actually wasnt) and backed up by Julian himself. You're digging your hole deeper. luckily for you almost no one will read this far down so your stupidity will be somewhat shielded.
I'm convinced you don't read the shit you link. Because that doesnt debunk anything. Your laziness is legendary. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:39:06
Sooo why did he mention journalists getting shot if he was mentioning the airstrike? 
One was a bombing. The other is not.
He tried to weasel of an answer.  
You're also trying to use leaked instant messenger messages to disprove something said under oath in a courtroom. Way to go. 
You've proven in other comments that you're new to this. Stop it. You thought I was making up the PGP release signatures when it was one of the biggest stories about WL last year. You know less than nothing about this.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:39:49
edit:   
Then the absolutely transparent "Russia Mass Surveillance" release where they revealed a 'trove' of largely publicly available information about Peter-Service and associated shit conventiently rightt when the Russia connection acusations were coming in. 
In addition to that, I also generally pay attention to these things and am not an idiot. So that contributes to making that assertion too. 
Something fundamentally changed about WL in the past several years. I think in time it will be discovered why and we will all look back and be able to point out the exact moment that their integrity was compromised. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:07:35
No he does not. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:43:23
early 2016 I believe. Wouldnt be surprised if they have intentionally removed legacy data though. And I'm still waiting to the link to that answer where he addressed the signatures. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:16:02
He's also a rapist that picks and chooses what information to release based on what is more likely to keep himself out of jail but let's overlook that.
What happened to this huge juicy russia release from 7 years ago Julian? Never came? hmmm...curious. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:19:21

 Perfect. 
soooo...whats your response now? is the hill reliable or not? maybe my original comment about examining content rather than reputation was on the money and you're just stubborn and dense? You tell me. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:07:46
Again. Your ignorance is showing. Read the fucking AMA I linked you. Read the fucking AMA YOU LINKED ME. This has been a concern for ages. Not from me but from anyone who has actually been following this shit since its inception. 
Remember when Julian claimed he was gonna release some steamy shit about Russia in 2010 and it never came? Pepperidge Farm remembers:
Try to learn to be less lazy and do proper research. You were upvoted in this thread by a bunch of people just as ignorant about this as you. It is irresponsible and idiotic for you to be making the assertions you're making with your blatant lack of knowledge on this. You're claiming they never signed releases? Please tell me you're kidding. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:02:19
You clearly havent been following WL very long. They took a VERY noticable turn in 2016 and suddenly their political bias (where they were previously neutral) started becoming much more apparent.
I genuinely don't know why I'm responding to you because it is clear you don't keep up with these things. This was the talk of the internet for several months when Julian's PoL was not being confirmed and his internet was shut off. The pivot WL made is obvious. You can even tell if you strictly look at their tweets over the past couple years. 
They also stopped cryptographically signing their releases during this time. 
MSM are barely catching up with the WL russia ties. People who follow this stuff have suspected it for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:32:17
Also, I think you're referring to the WL "staff" AMA. Where they dodged the most pressing and top voted questions (those that werent mysteriously deleted while at the top of the thread unanswered) Not fishy at all though. 
remember this gilded gem that went unanswered? 
"Thanks for taking questions. Here's mine: 
Why did Wikileaks [omit]( an email from release detailing a transfer of &amp;gt;€2bn (~$2.4bn) from Assad's regime in Syria to a state-owned Russian bank in 2012?

Let me know when you feel your opinion's ground is getting a little shaky. Promise I won't say "I told you so"
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:40:15
No. He wouldn't. You're wrong and in time you will come to see that. 
Not easy being right when you just learned about this stuff within the past few years, so I guess you have an excuse. Lack of context. It explains why you ignored the questions I asked you and went for ad-homs instead. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:49:13
analysis? 
Quoting someone and writing nonsense under it isnt an analysis. If he wrote anything worth responding to, I would have. 
He assumed I was taking John Mccain and Clapper's analysis when I knew this eas the case far before they came out about it. He also refuses to do additional research (and is ignorant) on additional information that the link I sent him doesnt include. If you follow WL even slightly you know where to find where these things were published. Like I said, If he presented any legitimate point I would have responded. None of that had any substance.
Nice dick tuck btw. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:07:28
Oh, so suddenly WL DID change now? 
That was my point the entire time. WL has been compromised. They are no longer neutral and they pick and choose what to release to their personal benefit/safety. They saw an opportunity where Russia might be able to help them against the US (the enemy of my enemy is my friend?) and now they've been sucked in. They can no longer be trusted. You can be a manipulative organization without ever lying. You just have to release some truths about people you don't like with perfect timing. 
Nice 2nd dick tuck not responding to my question again. I see a pattern. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:52:20

@_date: 2017-10-17 22:14:35
Do you speak Russian?
You want me to link you to 40+gigs of documents in a language you don't know?
Admit that you haven't been following this for very long. You're making me run in circles to locate things you could find yourself. Do you think the source lied about the cache? This cache was a well known release like 3-4 years ago. Again, if you have been involved with this stuff you wouldnt be questioning its very existance. That in itself is telling. Your lack of initiative shows both here, and in your opinion of the situation. That opinion is clearly only informed by lazy research and limited exposure to this scene. 
edit: 
that was the link several years ago when PB was hosted on a different domain. Go ahead and search for it (you won't, because you're lazy. and you don't speak russian either way, you just expected me to not find a link because you're ignorant enough about all this to think it didnt happen)
oh, and quick question since no one on here seems to want to address this. How come they stopped cryptographically signing their releases?

You clearly just started hearing about WL in the past couple years just like the other commenter because anyone who has been following them knows that things have clearly changed at WL outside of just "mainstream media coverage". When was the last time they signed a release with their private key?

and I hope you actually read that AMA and realized that it was just as fishy as the previous one. Top comment about hashes unanswered. You have to be one of two things to not see the writing on the wall:
1. Ignorant of the details of the situation and what the meaning behind him avoiding that question indicates
2. Malicious and have a vested interest in seeing Russia's will exerted through WL
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:35:53
That isn't an answer even remotely relating to the question. It's a blatant tangent and avoidance. Reading comprehension. What is it?
