dont mine btc it is not profitable anymore unless you have a mining farm... just buy it and hold until at least 2020

it should have an error and come back to your ltc wallet

bitcoin is not a physical currency? how could your toddler use a digital currency as a toy? bitcoin is stored in a wallet on a device or a paper wallet or hardware wallet (usb wallet)

"What should i do? I want money..., I just want easy money... " You sound very new to finance in general, never invest more than what you're willing to lose. It is to late to start mining imo. Your best option is to buy bitcoin during the dip happening now or buy weekly or monthly depending on your income. If you don't have a source of income I wouldn't be investing. Look up dollar cost averaging. And what do you mean break? a bitcoin cant break, the price fluctuates as any other market. There is no easy way to make money or get rich quick, you need to work hard like every other person, get a job !
