Much jealousy of getting in cheaper than someone at the beginning of the year!

Stuck at 3k for 10 years? WTF you clearly haven't been around for long. I heard this same shit just before it shot up to 9k

1k is the bottom that would kill Bitcoin? and 3-4k was a close call? But who owns how many miners and where are each located? The rumor is China has a lot but no specifics.
Does this mean anything?

So this is purely fear based theory or do you have any data to come to this conclusion?

Could you tell if the operation you were involved with at the time or after the cryptocurrency was seized had any significant impact on the change in market price or adoption?

If you are going to spent that much get a Trezor.

If you are going to try to make the voice of reason pitch at least be slightly realistic about the worst case scenario. Going to zero in a day, week or even a year is factually bullshit. How many shitcoins even go to zero (0.00000000) ? And how long does it take to crash compared to their volume?. In a major crash there is a transaction roadblock depending on the coin.

Let me guess, on jan 1 next year with the laws to "go crazy" with blockchain they are going to steal any and all things their people develop to integrate into their govdigitalmoney and then unban trading to onramp all of it to that shitcoin.

It's that time of the year to lock in losses to get tax refund for next year.
@_date: 2019-11-02 14:43:56
How does that compare to shorting it?

Yes, Trezor model T just has more features. FIDO2 instead of only FIDO1

What Zuck had to say wasn't much different than what Marcus said in Aug so it doesn't make sense it would have much affect

 And how many of you hated it just as much as you did after having watched it?
It was interesting though with the part with the friend talking about how banks hate bitcoin and want to destroy it by pumping and dumping to scare people away since they can't control it.

It's also a get learning about money quick scheme, get stressed quick scheme, get addicted quick scheme, and get paranoid quick scheme.

Wealth disparity won't allow you to be free though. I just don't want to become poorer (which means less free).

HELP ME!
I'm trying to find a comedy video that's like a fake news report on Bitcoin but it sounds like the guy is mumbling.

Why is nobody talking about theBitcoinPrivate fork tomorrow?

I sold at 6500 and bought back in at 7800. My excuse is I was so emotionally destroyed after hearing about a family member being very sick and not long to live and that I'll need to move out.
Threw away .57 btc fml.

Does anyone regret not selling a month ago to nearly double the amount of btc they have?

If they did you know they're trying to make 50x what they'd give you.
