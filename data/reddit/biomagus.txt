I speculate that most people don’t actually care who he really is. The public is more interested in the allure and mystery that surrounds his persona.
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:27:32
Even though the option exists, How was it confirmed that he used cash? Is this a presumption made through probabilities or is there hard evidence through investigation?
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:26:44
lol? Unless you want to back your first two points with references on why your statements are more true than mine then maybe you should take some time to think about that. As for 3, I think you’re jumping the gun. This post is just asking the public their thoughts on why something like this hasn’t happened. I’ve never implied that I personally want to seriously get involved in an official investigation. lol?
Your response is indicative of the nature of the mystery and those who speculate: serious questions and review result in backlash and resentment in defence of idol glorification.

I see you’re new to using Google? You can type in your full name and city and you’ll also get millions of unrelated results. If you want to reaffirm a previous point then it’s probably best you back it up with real examples instead of just inventing ideas, theories and references.

Yes, the option existed to pay in cash. How was it confirmed that he did versus PayPal? Is there any evidence as opposed to conjecture and presumptive motive?

The “we” in ‘important to secure bitcoin’ is for people who have a personal and/or financial investment in Bitcoin, which does not convert 100% of the people who are simply curious. 
Also, deducting that because of the mass attention by the public and private sectors around the world for a 10 year span doesn’t eliminate that something hasn’t been overlooked. It could also be a insanely deep and complex jurisdictional issue that no one has touched or cares to do so.

I can rationalize why someone would use one payment option over another given a set of circumstances but either way it’s irrelevant since we don’t actually know the circumstance. The advantage to PayPal is that it’s undoubtedly more convenient and faster to process. Also, why does anyone care? Almost next to zero people on this planet have a true and genuine investment in knowing his identity. The only reason we talk about him is curiosity and entertainment. However, that doesn’t preclude logic, facts and the truth.

Yeah, still not going to waste 7 hours watching a random interview.
Unfortunately, asking questions is not the same thing as sharing an opinion. However, interpreting questions as a statement (apparently an offensive one?) is a sign of serious fallacy in a discussion that revolves around fact and truth finding.

I think I hurt someone’s feelings? I suggest BetterHelp.com to help work these out. 
For the others reading this, let this comment signify the contrast between those with the fandom perception bias that obsessively defend and glorify a fictional idol and those that ask the questions that seek facts, the truth, and participate in reality (oh, also those that don’t watch 7 hour interviews about nothing).

Okay well, the FAQ specifically says it doesn’t accept money orders. Either way, yes okay the option to accept cash in the mail EXISTED but that doesn’t confirm the fact that he did use cash or not, it just means he could have. There’s a difference between probability and evidence, once is deducted through reasoning, logic and rationale and the other is through observation of physically tangible material. I’m leaning towards the latter as more conclusive.
@_date: 2019-09-10 23:24:16
Still waiting on that 5 minute investigation source that you cited. I’m really excited to see how I overlooked  something so ‘obvious’ when I figured everything was just conjecture.
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:13:30
How do you know this? Sources?
@_date: 2019-09-11 10:16:56
Hearsay and conjecture is not a display of intelligence. The discussion revolves around a simple question of whether he used a credit card or not. I didn’t state whether he did or did not use cash or credit but I did follow up with whether there was evidence of this. 
Since it’s apparent you’re unaware what evidence is, it’s a form of information that validates a belief. A belief can be a statement of observation or opinion from a person. Simply saying you heard it from someone else or a group of people doesn’t establish a fact beyond a reasonable doubt. At one time, everyone that ever lived thought the Sun revolved around the Earth and, as we know, that didn’t make it any more true. In the judicial system, where we look at more serious and pressing issues, eyewitness testimony is considered the absolute lowest form of evidence.
If you want to believe something you have no evidence of then so be it but if anyone is imposing it would be yourself. That is, unless you have something to offer that supports your claims?
Don’t worry, we got 5 minutes to spare. ;)

“We can find them”?? I didn’t encourage anyone to go and find him as it’s obvious there’s already enough existing interest that another voice wouldn’t make a difference.
However, I do find your insecure defensiveness amusing as it reveals how you want to protect your vision of who Satoshi Nakamoto is/was regardless of what may or may not be the truth. I think you need to slow down, take a deep breathe (albeit, pathetically), and move along.

In this article,
It describes and sources Sergio Lerner’s study and how he not only established that one miner mined 1M blocks but also presents evidence connecting them to Satoshi. I guess this isn’t conclusive either but it works as a motivator for interest.
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:34:39
Agreed lol
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:13:15
If this was true and there was hundreds if not thousands of threads about this topic (‘to a pulp’) then a reasonable person would expect 1.) no response at all 2.) links to similar discussion
If I Google “Did Satoshi Nakamoto pay for Bitcoin.org with cash” the only discussion I find is this exact Reddit thread. Ironic? ‘It must be a conspiracy!!!!!’

Also, don’t worry... your previous comment about a self proclaimed 5 minute investigation on ‘establishing’ that he used cash without any evidence or hard sources (even though I asked you to cite a source... like how hard could it be? it only took FIVE minutes right?) didn’t fly past me. Trust me, we noticed.
@_date: 2019-09-09 16:14:03
Oh a 7 hour podcast? No problem!
@_date: 2019-09-08 17:49:08
According to a 2007 version of AnonymousSpeech.con via archive.org in their FAQ section under Payment (Source:  it’s mentioned they offered PayPal as payment as well, so PayPal was an option back then.
See, I’m not flat out denying that Satoshi used cash as it seems to fit the established identity and culture of him and the community but probability alone cannot conclude fact. It’s obvious to me that an official and real world investigation hasn’t led to this and therefore we’re all left to speculate. Seems like an easy lead, although it still might lead to nowhere.
@_date: 2019-09-09 09:43:26
Lol Where does it say he paid with cash? Lack of reference/source implies you just presume he did. Stating things firmly as fact without evidence is definitively a troll.
