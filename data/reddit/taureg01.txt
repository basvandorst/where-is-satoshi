In my experience Cex.io was professional and when I was having issues with withdrawals to my credit card the issue was on my banks end not Cex.io.  I successfully wire transferred it and received it in 5 business days.

Focusing on past missed opportunity prevents you from recognizing future opportunity.

Let me explain, he bought the coins at an earlier point in time, so let's say he bought at $500 a coin.  Overtime as there value inflated they became a bigger percentage of his portfolio.  He probably only started with a 5% stake but because it has climbed so fast they now make up 50% of his portfolio.  He will probably re-balance soon.

Under 4 figures and you are worried about it?  It was speculation if you can't afford to lose a couple hundred dollars, stay out

Wow you bought at the absolutely top of a classic pump &amp; dump, when the speculation and hype is as high as that get in and get out on the way up for quick profit taking, you don't invest long term.  I bought at $1400 and sold at $2200 in less than 8 hours.  When it goes up that fast, get out of the way it's a falling knife.

I know but we have all been there and it definitely takes time to get over but what I said was true.  You end up losing money by only focusing on the past.
