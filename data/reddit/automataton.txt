Value comes later. People are only going to put their hard earned coin here ONLY IF BITCOIN IS  SUPER SUPER STABLE! I guess the original tweet should not be taken so literally. What matters is to understand the importance of paranoid level of obsession with stability of bitcoin software.
PS: stability = bug free, well tested bitcoin software.

I agree with everything. 
But my thing with hardware wallets is that they \*\*can\*\* have vulnerabilities. For me they are unknown black boxes that may have issues, with firmware updates, 0days.

Maybe  these hardware wallets are  good enough for most people, maybe not. I am no expert..
