What on earth are you talking about?  I *just* said i don't really like them.  I don't know why you brought Ripple and XRP up in the first place.  You're also wrong about the centralized nature of XRP.. I doubt you'll read this but [here]( that explains the road map to full decentralization for XRP, of which i own none, by the way. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:11:01
Nope.  Just a savvy investor and businessman who knows that launching a crypto hedge fund in the middle of a crypto market crash is a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:01
Probably cause they added Bitcoin Cash, or 'BCH'.

Haha, i think you have to be a bit more cautious when you're dealing with other peoples money.  It's not like he's canceling it, just delaying. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:09:28
I would say around zero.  He's not playing around here.  There are billions of dollars at stake in a venture like that. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:35:49
Did you ever consider that maybe people have genuine negative feelings about extremely high fees and slow transactions?  People trying to move smaller amounts literally can't anymore. Not everything is an attack, Bitcoin *users* are rightfully very frustrated.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:06:08
'In the past few months we've seen an increase in the volatility in the value of Bitcoin and a significant increase in the fees to process transactions on the Bitcoin network'.
- That's a damn shame.  I know the price is going up and up.. Which is great and all.. But the fees, volatility, and transaction times *are killing* any shot at this being used as a currency.  Is that idea officially dead?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:49:58
Something that's quicker and cheaper.  I'm not going to give you the answer you're angling for so you can jump down my throat. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:30:15
That may have been true in the past.  But i cannot pretend that the fees and slow transaction times aren't damaging Bitcoin.  It's losing market share on a daily basis as technologically superior coins gain stronger footholds.  The core development teams stalling and resistance to change *is* damaging Bitcoin.  Brand recognition can only sustain this for so long.   The community needs to wake up and realize this and start demanding action before it's too late, because believe me, that day is coming.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:54:25
Of course there are solutions.  You do know Bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency out there right?  Bitcoin is *the slowest and most expensive* out of all the top ones.  By far. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:34:36
If you had Bitcoin at the time of the fork you now have the equivalent of Bitcoin Cash.. It's worth more because the price of BCH is absolutely exploding now.  My advice is to buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:17:47
They would be more inclined to cover the fees if they were fractions of a cent, not well into the dollars.  The business play if you want Bitcoin to be a currency adopted by retailers is to put every effort into making it cheap and fast.  
Steam is a massive company that's ideal for payments with crypto.  It was a massive win when they started allowing purchases with Bitcoin, and it's a big loss now that they've stopped.  It's a lost opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:34
Coinbase/GDAX have officially added Bitcoin Cash as their 4th currency.  It's available to buy and sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:58:55
I'm not really a fan of Ripple or XRP but i'm not sure what you mean by printed more.. There can never be more than 100,000,000,000 XRP and some is destroyed with every transaction, making it deflationary. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:46:52
I don't have one.  I think the Bitcoin developers shit the bed on this big time.  It's a store of value now, and the price has never been higher, so that's great.. But something else will end up being used for quick cheap payments.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:01:46
You basically just agreed with my original comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:31:55
A lot of people do think bigger blocks are the solution actually, which is why things like BCH exist.  If everyone agreed there wouldn’t have been a fork.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:45:10
None of them.  That might be possible with Lightning Network in the future when it's been fully implemented.. When that's going to happen remains to be seen.  It's not ready, it may not be ready for some time, and neither you or i know exactly when it will be fully implemented.  I'm not criticizing it's potential, just pointing out that you can't rely on something that hasn't happened.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:36:13
The longer that takes the less likely it is to be successful.  There are already other projects doing the currency thing better than Bitcoin.  Lighting Network delays only serve to solidify those other currencies market share and adoption.  If Lightning Network takes another two years to be fully implemented it will likely be too late. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:40:28
It's in the alpha stage of development.. That can go on for quite some time.. Then they will do a closed beta and probably an open one before full implementation.. Given that this project has already been delayed and hit snags, it's not unreasonable to assume it could be another couple years away. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:52:21
Technically it was, they refused to do it with BTC on the original chain so it was forked and implemented with BCH. 
- You are downvoting what amounts to a historical fact.. You do know that right?   
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:22:13
Be more of a baby, wow.  Win by being the better tech.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:15:49
Haha yeah, i know all about that.  Mistakes cost you when you're dealing with huge sums of money.  Which is why proceeding with caution with this venture is the wise move.  I do think it's kind of ridiculous that you're calling a billionaire who made his billions investing, an "abysmal investor" though. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:23:18
Yeah, giant companies generally don't want to accept speculative assets as currency.  The ones that do/did accept Bitcoin were selling it for USD immediately anyway.. Not letting it sit in a wallet on the chance it increased in value.   They were dumping it to mitigate the chance of losses. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:53:57
Yeah I've heard that argument.  I'm not buying it.  It's been interesting to watch the narrative change over time.  It used to be the selling point of Bitcoin that it was fast, convenient, and cheap.  Then it was the message that it can be digital gold, a store of value *and* a payment system.  Finally, now that it's been stripped of it's utility and is being dropped by businesses like a hot potato (Steam, BitCart, Bitspark to name a few, Bitpay is adding BCH because no one is using BTC to pay for anything anymore), they have changed it again.. Now the narrative they are trying to sell is that insane fees are a good thing to fend off inflation which isn't even really an issue yet, and which other coins have solved with things like a burn rate.  So no, i'm not buying that argument.  It's just a delay tactic because *everything* is riding on the Lightning Network, which is still a question mark, and may come too late now.  
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:16:57
Miners can now use [Nexo]( to retain their Bitcoin while they pay operating expensive with crypto backed loans instead of having to sell it.  That way they don't have to lose the gains from the appreciation in value either.   So that problem is being solved as well. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 02:42:07
Coinbase is a shitty company.  
@_date: 2019-03-04 16:12:32
Lol going to Bitcoin cause you don’t like highs fees eh.  Oh dear.
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:34:31
So?  That one time would cut the risk down massively compared to just leaving it on an exchange all the time.
@_date: 2019-03-02 16:51:02
Well, they will track every single thing you do and give that information to the US government.  That's good enough reason for me not to use them.  But they also bought a company that has worked in the past to silence dissidents and journalists, and support human rights abuses around the world.  Basically Coinbase was already a terrible company with stupid fees, and now they're slanting off into evil company territory and people should stop using them. 
'For example, the Washington Post reported Hacking Team worked directly with the Saudi Arabian government, including the enforcement group that allegedly murdered dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The startup’s website touted a “hacking suite for governmental interception,” describing its wares as “offensive technology.” This spyware also aided surveillance and arrests of journalists in Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates,'
“This acquisition of Neutrino supports the idea of using bitcoin for surveillance capitalism.”
- Delete Coinbase, never look back.  They were an enemy of Bitcoin, privacy, and financial freedom before, but it's gotten worse.   This should be the final straw for most people.

Money is value though.  You can work all day and expel tons of energy for very little money.  I can do nothing all day and expel almost no energy and earn far more money.  This is because value does not equal energy spent.

But why?
@_date: 2019-10-06 16:15:25
They're pivoting to shitcoins.  You can see it in the narrative changing.  They're going to try and sell everyone on a centralized system they built called Liquid and the tokens they and their partners create on that network.
Watch it happen downvoters.   They’ll suddenly start marketing a slew of tokens they get a piece of, launching on their centralized network.  Bitcoiners on twitter with lap it up, noobs will buy them, and blockstream will have found a new revenue stream.  The same stream they and maximalists have been shitting on everyone else for doing.  Dumping shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:46:51
Lol, think this through for two seconds please... What would happen to the price of Bitcoin if someone tried to buy 1,000,000 of them?

Ehhh kind of.  I know what you're saying.. But they're not actually accepting Bitcoin.  At no point does the Mavericks organization hold Bitcoin.  They are being paid in USD.  That's what they end up accepting for their services.
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:21:33
Hm okay.  Well you know they're using BitPay right?  They're not actually accepting Bitcoin.  People can pay with BTC and the Mavericks get USD.
@_date: 2019-10-06 02:32:54
Dollar cost average.  Basically you buy over a period of time, say today, and then next Saturday, and the following two as well.  You'd get an average price over that time.. It's a way to hedge against volatility as you get into the market.  It can save you sats, or you might lose some if the price goes up.  But i think it's a decent strategy, cause buying in and having it tank right after is a shitty feeling..  This way you mitigate that a bit.
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:27:33

@_date: 2019-10-03 05:20:13
Keep in mind how few people actually have Bitcoin at this point out of the potential pool of investors and users.. We're going to need that blockspace, and the transaction fees will pick up as the network grows.  You can also get a 4TB hard drive for $100, so that's not really a compelling argument as this will only get cheaper too.

@_date: 2019-10-05 03:43:36
That's probably what's going to happen.  There's no volume, not much institutional interest, and practically zero new retail interest.  If there are buyers they're lurking at lower levels.  Long term it will probably go back up.. But maybe not!  This is an experiment, and if you go back a few years to where people thought Bitcoin would be today in terms of usability it's not even close.  So who the hell knows.  I'm personally long term bullish though.
@_date: 2019-10-03 20:10:46

You could try Kraken or LocalBitcoins.  The US is trying to ruin Bitcoin with overbearing regulations and taxes.  It's a shame.
It will cost you a bit more but you can always just take out cash from your bank account and go to a Bitcoin ATM and load up a mobile wallet directly.

@_date: 2019-10-02 15:53:39
Criminals were the first people after cypherpunks to use Bitcoin.  Governments looking to evade sanctions are just another evolution in that history.

I mean, you don't have to invest that much.  It's about profitability.   You could spend the money on 1 ASIC and then join a mining pool.  But it would take you years to even get an ROI, by which time the price of Bitcoin would likely have appreciated immensely, making simply buying Bitcoin with that money the better choice for you.

People are interested in the 'why' and 'how' because no one wants to watch Bitcoin tank and Bitcoin cash go up 1000% and beyond.  This is especially true for people holding large amounts long term.  People have long said Bitcoin is a dinosaur that will be replaced. Well, do you want to sit on a supply and watch the change happen while your investment disappears?  No.  I for one care deeply about the 'why' and the  'how' and whether or not this is manipulation or a new trend.  Anyone who isn't paying attention to what's going on in the market they're invested in is a fucking idiot.  The 'why' and 'how' are crucial to any risk management strategy. 
@_date: 2019-10-02 00:08:22
You can pay with Bitcoin sure, but it's converted to USD at the point of sale.  They're not accepting Bitcoin in lieu of dollars.

Miners save up their Bitcoin and dump into strong buying pressure and when the price of Bitcoin is higher than the cost of producing them.  They're some of the biggest sellers and they're not going to be dumping below a certain point.  It's counterproductive and detrimental to their long term business success.
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:27:17

Because someone literally pumped $100 million into it on 3 exchanges in 1 hour. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:53:57
If you can't spend them while the channel is open in case you need to close it, and when you close it you have to spend them.. Then it's not your money.  It is no longer yours to spend.  It's never available to you as a money, it's like a tax/fee that fluctuates and subtracts from your available balance. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:49:23
Except you are losing those funds.  If they are necessary to close the channel, then it's a reduction of your available balance.  That money is no longer yours to spend, and your available funds can fluctuate without your consent.  How can you not see that?  Your argument is just saying that some days less of your money will be available to you, and some days more will, but it's not in your control at all and whatever amount winds up being necessary to close the channel you lose, and all the while you keep it open you can't spend those funds.  
@_date: 2019-04-05 01:14:47
No the funds are lost when you open it.  Because they are always held incase you need to close it.   No need to insult me.  I hold both BTC and BCH.   I just don’t like the LN.
@_date: 2019-04-11 19:54:29
Why are you making high risk speculative investments if you and your family are that close to extreme poverty and starvation?  Priorities man.  Be more responsible.
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:11:47
Spending it implies you have a choice.  Which you don't.  You can have money sitting in your channel, and if the fee goes up less and less of your money is available to you. 
@_date: 2019-04-17 17:05:16
You guys have a bizarre obsession with Roger Ver, who is not a developer working on Bitcoin Cash.  Good luck with this petition i guess, it's not going to work.
@_date: 2019-04-03 00:27:55
This doesn't really work when you consider they won't accept Bitcoin at all though.. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:18:51
To me it means that early investors and people who can afford larger investments (the accredited type of investor) will get their digital gold.   Massive fees won’t matter to them, and it will be a great store of value.   But, this will close the door to BTC for quite literally *billions* of people globally.   This includes most of you if you weren’t already holding.   Coins like BCH will have a much much larger group of people able to cheaply and easily use it as money, and when something is used globally for commerce it becomes a store of value because of that widespread use.   You will have a bankers coin, the rest of the world will have Bitcoin as it was intended.   I’ll have both so I’m all set either way lol.
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:53:10
Well, to be completely honest.. In hindsight it seems like refusing to raise the block size caused all of these issues including BCH existing in the first place, for no good reason.  But whatever, what's done is done, we'll see how it plays out. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 22:04:14
Lol pick one. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:47:43
I'm not sure it can be fixed.  The whole thing seems flawed.  Even if it does work it will inevitably lead to large hubs (necessary for it to work properly) being controlled by large companies and financial institutions.  It's designed to make money, not to be a good user experience or a cheap payments system.  If you start thinking about it from that perspective then the lack of meaningful development of BTC makes a lot more sense.. If you want to force people onto a secondary layer you can profit from, you make settlement on chain slow and very expensive.  This is all plainly out in the open to see now, i just don't get it.  This isn't Bitcoin.  The fact that LN is being sold as basically the ONLY solution should tell you everything.  
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:25:20
Obviously I meant if I was using it.  I’m aware I have a choice.  For transacting there are better options already.  
@_date: 2019-04-04 21:39:57
Read how ridiculous what you just wrote is.  Hell, read any description of how this disaster of a network works and honestly tell me that's going to lead to mass adoption.  Please.  It's barely comprehensible to people already familiar with Bitcoin, let alone the general public.  This is a failure and it's high time the community admits it. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:05:55
How are you not understanding this.  If you ALWAYS need to have enough to close the channel, even if you want to leave it open forever, then that money is NEVER available to you to spend.  It's gone. 
With a fee market for LN, which is a terrible terrible idea.. You could actually end up with a situation where just to use your already open channel you have to move more funds in because the fee has gone up lol.  Enjoy that.  I have no need whatsoever to use the LN network in it's current form, and neither does anyone else. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:43:53
Stupid waste of time.  Was not necessary, is not necessary, still doesn't work properly and is not accessible or easy to use.  Ignore the price?  Should have ignored this foolishness and increased the blocksize and focused on adoption.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:51:30
Huh? You guys refused to increase the blocksize and have spent the last few years building the ever delayed and barely usable lighting network instead.. Going on about your 'store of value'.. Ringing any bells?  For fucks sake you people have goldfish like memories.  You gave up on adoption and 'spending bitcoin' a long time ago.   It's why we had that incredibly stupid fork. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:23:25
I don’t hold or like Bitcoin.  I hold other coins/tokens.  I saw this on and think it’s a very funny post.

Binance i think.
@_date: 2019-09-28 20:25:43
Well, it ignores the possible effects of regulation for one thing.  And past performance not being a good model for the future IS a pretty good thing to keep in mind.  Bitcoin has only existed for just over 10 years.  That means there's only been two halving events so far.  There's not that much data yet.  A lot of people thought Bitcoin would be a lot further ahead in terms of adoption by now too.. We'll just have to wait and see.  If the price really tanks and stays down, i'm pretty sure that's going to invalidate the model anyway isn't it?  Will decrease demand which must keep increasing for the model to work.  Since payments with Bitcoin are not cutting it, we basically have to hope demand comes from the price mooning.. If not it’s hard to see where it’s going to come from.  I'd love for it to be accurate personally.. I'll be epically rich in a couple of years if it is.
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:41:49

Unless you're an experienced trader, just buy some Bitcoin and hold onto it.  'Stack sats'.. Aka buy a bit of Bitcoin whenever you can.

They have collectively lost their minds now.  All they have are wild conspiracy theories.  
Epstein donates $1.7 mil to MIT Media Labs over several years, accounting for a small percentage of their $75 million annual operating budget.  They fund hundreds of researchers across many fields.. They have funded some Bitcoin Core devs as part of this.

Seems like some of you are incapable of admitting that liquidity does exist outside of BTC.  It does.  It's not as significant, or all that significant at all.. But it's there, and there's a not small amount of money tied up in alts like ETH and XRP that could, and probably will flow into Bitcoin at some point before that liquidity collapses completely.  I think we'll see more capitulation and a big flow into Bitcoin from some large bagholders around the Bitcoin ATH.

Please.  
Bitcoin’s first decade:
$1 billion has cumulatively been paid in transaction fees
Miners have cumulatively collected $14 billion in exchange for their services in securing the network
The average cost basis of all Bitcoin holders is approximately $100 billion
The market value of all outstanding bitcoins is approximately $190 billion
The network has settled roughly $2 trillion worth of transactions
The Bitcoin network now produces 80 exahashes per second (that’s 8 * 10¹⁹ hashes). These hashes cost about $19.8 million dollars a day on highly specialized equipment

I never said i'd found any bugs, i'm not a developer.  There have been issues with it, the most recent being the critical bug that's currently stickied at the top of this sub.  It's about the risks of there potentially being more..  The risk of that is obviously higher in something like LN which is still in beta and relatively untested vs something like Bitcoin which is battle tested.  Nothing is a sure thing, but i will not risk my hard earned Bitcoins on something i don't need to use for any reason at all right now.  That's how i minimize risk.. Honestly it's the same sort of logic that keeps me away from alt coins now.  I don't trust these experiments.  I do trust Bitcoin.

Where did they go online.  Further centralizing the mining in China?  The article says there's growing interest in Siberia, but doesn't say whether any of these ASICS went online there, or who they were operated by.  A lot of the mining in other countries is still Chinese miners.  It's a threat to Bitcoin due to the CCP's iron fisted control over businesses within the country, and also because the majority of Bitcoin mining should not fall under any one jurisdiction.  I'm glad Blockstream is launching two facilities in Canada and the US, but we need more.
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:18:10
Because if you trade without knowing what you're doing you will lose your money.  Bitcoin is likely to continue to appreciate in value in the long term.  There's a strong chance they could be worth over $100k+ each in a few years.  You're 17, you're young with a lot of life left ahead of you, there's no rush for you at all.  One of the best things you could do for your future is to start buying and holding Bitcoin.  You could find yourself very well set up by the time you're in your early twenties if you start doing this.

As such statements like this are dangerous and wrong: 'Are your bitcoins still locked up on the main chain? Set them free on the Lightning Network'.   That's all i'm saying.  Encouraging people to be guinea pigs with their coins instead of trusting the security of the main chain which has never been better doesn't strike me as very responsible.

I mean, you're basically just saying 'don't flaunt your wealth'.  People get robbed for their valuables all the time.  Bitcoin or no Bitcoin.  Not telling anyone you own Bitcoin is a good thing to practise.  But if you spend your Bitcoin on a ballin house, nice cars, and a bunch of jewelry, you increase your risk of getting robbed whether or not you have BTC.

Really curious what people think about this.  What would the advantages of lowering the block size be?  Is Veriblock not entitled to use a permissionless system like Bitcoin however they want if they're paying the fees (they are)?

You can use Kraken.  You can link your bank account to the exchange for deposits and withdrawals.  They're highly reputable.  
You can also buy via Coinbase.  But i personally don't recommend this because they're scum.  
You might be able to buy directly on Binance via card too, so have a look at that.
LocalBitcoins.com would be another option.
You can also take cash out of your bank account and feed it into a Bitcoin ATM if you prefer, this will cost you more though.
There's probably others i can't remember.  We have quite a few options is the point.

The main selling points of Bitcoin are decentralization, security, and scarcity.  Fuck any one of those things up and it's over.

“��Important security update��
Update your Lightning nodes immediately as we've confirmed instances of the CVE being exploited.”
“This is also a great time to remind folks that we have limits in place to mitigate widespread funds loss at this early stage. There will be bugs.
Don't put more money on Lightning than you're willing to lose!”
@_date: 2019-09-08 15:29:09
Lightning Network is experimental technology very much in beta.  There is no reason for anyone to lock their Bitcoin there at this time.  It's buggy with a lot of issues and nowhere near ready for primetime.  
Right now it's actually quite fast and cheap to transact on-chain anyway.  So there's even less point in risking your BTC on beta LN.

Kim Coin is an extremely lame and egotistical move.  I have a hard time seeing this as anything but a cash grab to pad his legal defense fund.  I'm sure Blockstream guys like Sampson will try to act like this isn't a shitcoin too because it's on their Liquid network.  Actually, i predict a lot of tokens get launched via Liquid and are promoted by the same people who have been shitting on every other shitcoin for years.
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:37:09
We're getting regulated too.  If regulators get their way it's just going to be a slower version of PayPal.  Regulation is the antithesis to Bitcoin.  Give them an inch, they will try to take a mile.  Fortunately they move slow and the tech moves fast.

Yeah i thought it was kind of fucked up that he was basically arguing against Bitcoin being a permissionless system, and arguing against it being used by a company who's paying the fees like everyone else.
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:57:27
For me the issue is not whether the hashrate fluctuated.  It's if a 30% drop was real, was it attributed to one mining farm?  Because that would not be ideal.  No one seems to really be able to pin down exactly how centralized, or not, mining really is.
@_date: 2019-09-29 20:34:56
Wow that’s a lot for how little it’s used for anything though.

The Bitcoin Genie.  You have to whisper 'Satoshi' three times in the mirror while stroking yourself for it to appear.
@_date: 2019-09-16 20:31:11
Haha, well the price of Bitcoin surged several hundred percent this year.. And now the hashrate is surging.  So the hashrate IS following the price..  You basically wrote the answer to your question.
@_date: 2019-09-16 00:56:52
For sure.  I look at incidents like Jameson being swatted and learn to just be quiet about my Bitcoin holdings IRL.  For a lot of these guys it's too late.. They're too public already.

Dude, relax.  It's going to be fine.

Perhaps.  It highlights the miner centralization issue.. Which IS an issue.  We can debate how bad of one, but pretending there's no problem seems foolish.

Oh cool.  Well my suggestion would be to find your local Bitcoin ATM:

Oh look, new vulnerabilities in LN that were exploited.  
@_date: 2019-09-18 22:08:09
Lol, you can’t expect them to actually do anything resembling research for these dogshit articles.  That would be way too hard.
@_date: 2019-09-17 03:07:37
Bitcoin isn’t left or right.  It flies in face of the entire system.   Bitcoin doesn’t care who you vote for.   Having these discussions is pointless, and trying to assign any particular political ideology to Bitcoin is counter productive and dangerously divisive.

Welcome to futures.  They fucked the gold market for years too.

Because Bitcoin is the only coin that actually matters in this market.

It's definitely something that happens a little slower than right away.  It makes sense if you think about the time it takes to acquire hardware, rent space, figure out your power situation etc.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:40:14
Have you heard the expression 'stacking sats'?  That seems like the path you should take.  You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin at once, or ever actually.. They are highly divisible.  The smaller units are referred to as 'sats'.. So basically you would just buy $100 or however much you want on an ongoing basis.. Use Bitcoin like a super long term savings account, and see what happens in a few years.

@_date: 2019-09-08 15:10:54
Uh no.  That's going to be a hard pass.  This guy should not be encouraging anyone to do this while it's in beta and they JUST found a bug that would have allowed for the loss of funds super recently.  Also 'setting them free' and locking them in a LN channel are contradictory.
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:15:19
Yup.  But so far their volume is nothing.  They're not a metric to judge anything by yet.

I like Kraken better than Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-09-28 02:13:30
Make an account on one of the exchanges, Coinbase, Kraken, Binance etc.  Buy via card or wire.  Or look up your local Bitcoin ATM and feed it some cash and put the Bitcoin in a mobile wallet.  Read the sidebar here too.

@_date: 2019-05-24 21:18:30
Yes, go find where CZ proposes doing a re org.. All you will find is him referencing the fact that they had some conversations about it after it was presented as a possibility... By a core dev no less... Before decisively saying it would never happen on twitter an hour later after everyone got their panties in a twist.

In no world is Bitcoin fast.  It's expensive and slow as dirt... But it's secure.

No he didn't.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:29:20
Well of course it's relative.  But if the end goal is p2p cash then it's clearly too slow for that.  If it's not, then yeah it's great for securely storing and sending large amounts of money, and it's an improvement on a bank wire.  Not sure why you're getting angry lol.
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:07:38
If we’re only talking speed for payments then no it’s not.  It’s faster than a wire though.
@_date: 2019-05-24 22:09:14
Yeah i was watching it live.  CZ does not propose doing a re org of the Bitcoin blockchain.  A core dev was the one who suggested it to them.  We're not debating whether or not it was discussed, just who proposed it.  Which was not CZ.
@_date: 2019-05-09 21:57:06
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:20:20
That's not fast.  It's miles too slow to be used for transacting out and about.  It's perfectly fine for moving large amounts in a very secure way though.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:22:49
If I had any money to spare I would.  It will go up again.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:34:50
You're calling me autistic for having a mild disagreement with you about what constitutes 'fast' in payments?  That's not very nice lol.
