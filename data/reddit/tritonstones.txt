You can if you want.  I haven't done it before so I'm not a good person to ask.

If I didn't want my transaction rebroadcasted, I personally wouldn't post it on reddit.  It costs nothing to broadcast a transaction, and there plenty of people around with nothing better to do.

Keepkey uses the Blockcypher blockchain explorer which doesn't show low fee transactions for very long.  If you put your transaction ID in blockchain.info, it should show up.

You think this is more profound than anybody else will think.

Self educate yourself my friend.  Look to the sidebar for basic knowledge, Google the rest to fill in the gaps.

We could always enact Transactionless Tuesdays.  If everyone took a day off, the mempool would clear pretty quick.

Congrats.  As someone who had about 7 txs stuck at the first of the year, I can relate.

My friend, as your trusted reddit associate and bitcoin friend,  I Googled "otc bitcoin" and highly recommend that you use Itbit.  It is a very trustworthy website that comes highly recommended.

Personally I'd just wait it out.

Hell yeah.  That drop is going parabolic.

I agree.  People have a short attention span.  It was on Fox news and CNN when it was going up and everybody wanted in.  The exchanges couldn't handle it and the blockchain got swamped.  Now the only coverage on the news is negative so the price is settling back down.  
It makes sense to me.

Keepkey pumps out a QR code for addresses on the device and its chrome extension.

It all depends on which blockchain explorer they use.  Doesn't mean that it's not still floating in the mempool waiting to be confirmed.

Metal etch your seed words into a knife that you keep in your toolbox.

You are just wasting money to send it now.  If it's not urgent, wait until fees go down.

I would probably pull some money out of crypto to invest in stocks at a discount if I needed the extra capital.
@_date: 2018-02-23 00:02:34
Good for you.  
Other people still need to find a friendly bank to buy BTC with their money.

Get a 6 inch putty knife.  Use a metal engraver to write seed words on it.  Cover seed words with some joint compound.  Hang on the wall  in your garage behind another putty knife.

Ok, how about metal etch the seed on the  backside of a metal outlet cover and then screw it back in place.  Bequeath the outlet cover to your next of kin in a will.  Easy.

Hmm...etch seed on the bottom of your metal mailbox.  Safe from house fires and painters and as far as I know, not a high value target for thieves.
