BTC the largest pyramid scheme the world has known with no real value but collection and people’s greed.

It’s not easy to block subs using a mobile unfortunately, this and Vegan sub would cease on my popular if so. I was around when this scam began and snubbed it. The Bitconnect con infuriated me reading how people lost large amounts. Banks blocking transactions in the aftermath and wish I could have vented then with hindsight.  BTC is worthless, requires new subscribers to elevate it’s value, brings huge burden on national grids to fill the vacuum of energy needed to solve the algorithms, restricts production to help grow value, is unregulated and lastly has no promise or insurance to pay the bearer. 
Costs 99p to make a £1. 
Sheep to the slaughter in what relies on human hoarding and greed to build the pyramid in which few prosper and many lose. It’s disgraceful this is championed as being “diverse” and “unregulated”.  Sure banks are scum but to create another beast is total immoral.

Absolutely ridiculous. Anyone thinking of investing in data currency is in no fit state to manage their own money.  The only ones pushing a mystical positive spin are those who have it to drive traction to inflate trade price. The key word is trade, it doesn’t hold purchase of goods value. Anybody researching BTC should stay away.  The only beneficiaries are those who got in early and need new investment to increase their stock value. This is typical of what is known as a pyramid scheme. YOU will be at the base feeding interest to those that hold. Do not waste your hard earned money. I have and never will invest in this scam.
