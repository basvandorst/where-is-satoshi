Some of it sounded like him though. It sounded like he got a rundown from someone and copied some of the sentences from said rundown and mixed it in with his own trumpisms.

Obviously not coinbase.

Words don't mean anything anymore.

Yeah, I've done the same thing with fiat too.

Did facebook ever respond to that congress letter asking for a moratorium?
@_date: 2019-07-12 15:35:34
Honestly the more I reread the tweets it sounds like, "I don't like bitcoin, etc, but don't really care about them. However, this Libra Facebook thing is a real issue that needs regulating."

Nice, you did a good job playing just dumb enough.

Top tier content.

No, it has to do with someone telling him that cryptocurrency doesn't help his investments.

Fiat money has been used for more crime than any cryptocurrency.

Does this idiot think social security is only one year?

It's a crap post.

This community can get behind some dumb shit sometimes.

Someone told him that this could hurt his interests and investments. This sounds like Trump after someone told him this.
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:24:56
Yeah, Libra seems to officially be the thing that is going to get cryptocurrency the attention of regulators.

It's been like one day, chill.

Trump said he was saying in a different tweet that perhaps they should play china's game and weaken the dollar.
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:48:29
Well, like I said in another post, it sounds more like he copy/pasted some sentences out of a report he received and then added his own comments (hence the exclamation mark, and some of the awkward, exuberant phrasing).

Just coinbase

How is it possible that you think that happened in the 90s?
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:16:09
How old are you?
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:41:10
It's bizarre that you would think that happened in the 90s. I'm truly curious how old you are that you have such a limited understanding of very recent technological history. 
It's akin to thinking there were smart phones in the 1980s.

My guess is it will hit $18k and then stay around there for a week at most before dropping back down to 8-10k for some time. 
What I'm wondering is if it will drop down below that or stay steady at that point.

Was that a quote out of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn?
