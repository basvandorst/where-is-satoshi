I'm no computer science nerd, but here's a scenario:  
In a world where BTC is the main, mass-adopted currency &amp; LN is widespread:  
You may be down to no coins, but let's assume that at some point you had a job, received a paycheck, and opened 3 or 4 (or 20) balanced channels with people connected to your rental company / utility company / grocery store for a total of $2500. You use these channels regularly to pay your bills and buy great value items at WalMart.  
When you paid for this month's rent/ electricity bill / food, these channels became entirely unbalanced, and since you're out of spendable funds on the lightning network (assuming LN is mass adopted and no one needs to close the channel), you now HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE $5K.  
amirite?  
Math check: $2500 x 2 = $5000

Did anyone else notice that the sign shows a picture of the same sign in front of the house. Literally a photo within a photo ..... and it's a fake scam  
Edit: it's a photo within a photo within a photo within a photo

Great news. Sadly, politicians don't tend to keep their promises ��
Hopefully this guy is different.
