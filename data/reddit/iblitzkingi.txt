I mean you can just say fuck it but I would recommend that only if you’re gambling and also only if you’re young like late teens or early 20s, you know, risk tolerance and all that Jazz.

It’s just pisses you off when someone is a just so “a matter of fact about something” but they’re completely wrong.

Don’t forget he also inherited ALL of the connections his father had.  Deals with contractors, banks, etc on top of inheriting the wealth.  The connections are invaluable.

Except if you say bitcoin is going up, you get a lot of upvotes.  Double standard though huh.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:15:21
But also is it hard to just not reply to them or just simply answer them?
As for the answer, yes trezor does support segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:58:46
And I gave you a fantastic solution guaranteed to reduce stress.  :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:02:30
Yeah if they suddenly came up and said they found the money they lost from their wallet, I would certainly ask how much.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:25:31
Except you don’t lock in the BTC price that way on purchase.

You’re a shill, he’s a shill, we’re all shills.  Shill shill shill shill. Yuuuge shill.
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:28:07
Then don't.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:00:10
Hey can you get the fuck out of here?  We don’t need people like you here either that just attack others for no reason.  It’s good to be skeptical of people and question, but you’re being an “arse wipe” in the process of your attempt.  He ask d a very simple question that didn’t seem negative in the slightest.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:25:46
I'm REALLY trying to understand the outrage.  I regularly see, oh they released it and didn't announce it.  Is that grounds for completely not doing business with them?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:18:31
Big maybe.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:17:52
You’re more childish than the 14 year old.  This is hilarious!
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:30:47
IF that is indeed what's happening, sure.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:37:45
It’s just the way it is done honestly that makes it seem very immature.  Name calling, repetitiveness, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:26:25
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:01:40
We should specifically do the roadster.  
@_date: 2018-05-07 00:51:56
Eh I'm not too fond of this guy that much anymore.  Seeing that documentary on netflix rubbed me the wrong way about his character and how he acts.  idk
I still believe Bitcoin can get up there though.
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:52:23
You can confiscate it but you can forcibly make it change hands to someone else.  Guess that’s not the same. :/
“take or seize (someone's property) with authority.”

I believe it was this, “Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee”
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:29:51
If it is court ordered and legal to do so in that country, then it is technically legal and would not be theft, it would indeed be confiscation.  Not arguing whether this is right or wrong morally, just saying how it is in a legal sense.
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:05:45
idk to me it seems super inconvenient to buy from people at localbitcoins.  Seems like you have to jump through even more hoops.
@_date: 2017-01-07 04:30:19
Well a lot of these sellers want you to go to physical banks and if they accept credit cards they want ID uploaded.  There's no way I'm giving my ID to an individual, I'm already a little apprehensive giving it to these companies like Coinbase.  I would just rather use coinbase tbh.  Sure it may be the same process with the company and an individual, but I'm going with a company 9 times out of 10 
@_date: 2017-01-02 17:01:43
Stop being so vague in the way you're typing. It's really fucking annoying
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:22:22
I mean your bank has all that stuff too.  And Coinbase is setup as a bank.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:42:49
Now I have to trust everyone.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:15:15
Yeah but would  you want to be the one to try to buy 500k worth of bitcoin at once or in a short time?
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:01:50
You call him an asshole and then call him names.  hmmmm
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:59:22
@_date: 2018-03-02 20:37:26
Shit do grocery stores fully accept bitcoin yet?
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:34:24
Moral of this interaction.  Don't be a cunt please.
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:38:08
hmm I would call a short term rapid downturn a DIP, but that's just me I guess?
@_date: 2018-03-26 09:41:15
I don’t think you’ve used a credit cards in a while.  They do give cash back and points and shit and don’t cost extra money unless you’re late to pay but in some cases they can be waived.  Unless you’re talking about the sales tax, in which case everyone pays that.  Idk I like bitcoin and credit cards, yesterday I had a transaction confirm in 20 minutes, that’s awesome.  But I also regularly use credit cards and get fraud protection and cash back, also phone insurance.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:11:03
I’m just calling out someone’s stupidity to actually believe this would be something integrated with PayPal.  If you believed it did, you are genuinely stupid. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:27:37
The hypocrisy.
@_date: 2017-09-28 01:36:23
He could have replied "Thanks Dad, but Bitcoins can get crazy and I've profited a lot already.  I want to see what happens.  Plus these JP Morgan guys are effin shady."  idk something like that?
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:45:03
This is a troll move along boys.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:14:20
I always think it’s funny when people complain about taxes.  Like ok, don’t use the roads, don’t go to the National parks, don’t receive any mail etc etc.  Regardless of how much goes to the military budget ( which perecentage wise, isn’t as much as I thought) you’re still using these services paid for by taxes, cunts.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:54:06
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:20:38
How is it confusing at all?  Take a few minutes to read the article or just look at the title.  idk maybe it could have been worded differently, but I wasn't confused at all.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:08:44
How do you pay for the roads if not for taxes?  Just one example because construction of buildings, medical, and social programs are all funded because of taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:52:33
I can see the reason why they worded it the way they did though.  It truly is like how PayPal integrates their buy buttons on different websites which makes it relatable to regular consumers.
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:11:51
Lol that guy who replied to this comment fucked off real quick.  But yeah this was a thought out response.  Just because you don’t like something to be called a certain way, doesn’t mean it’s wrong.  Like relax, there’s more important things to worry about.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:47:55
If you can show me proof of 90% then go right ahead.  EXACTLY 90%.  I know for sure we spend a lot of money on wars.
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:54:25
The price DOES affect stability though.  No one wants to set up a lending platform using bitcoin because it's too risky.  That's one example.
