Why didn't I give hundreds of people 4 dollars each for no reason?
Is.....is that the question here?

No. Go to [It's in the sidebar.

Awful site design. Everything under "music" and "ringtones" needs to be chopped off. The content down there isn't worth selling anyway. Focus and specialize, or nobody's gonna use your muddled mess of a service. Do you see TurboSquid selling music? No, you don't

But at least it's a private company with too much power fucking you around and not DA GUBMINT.

Wow, a site where people pay to see stuff other people found on Google Image Search. Brilliant.

Whenever whores get called whores they cry sex positivism.
We're not "closed minded", you're just a nasty skank
But thank you, keep it somewhere else and don't fucking flood us with it.
@_date: 2012-04-09 02:49:11
Oh, and "safe" means "circlejerk where we censor criticism"
You have no power to do that here, so we're gonna tell you to fuck off. Run and hide in your hole if you want that.
Fuck off.

Doesn't really bother me if his site continues to suck. The web is full of sites that suck. But if he wants to not suck, well, now he knows he sucks, and knowing is half the battle.

Well at least you're obviously not a retarded neckbeard who stole some photos like the last one
Still, this is pathetic, please fuck off. This is the beginning of a flood of this kind of desperate garbage. Let's NOT start this here. I mean, you're not even very good looking, so it'll be no time before every girl who's a 4 or 5 like you starts whoring for bitcoins. Just go away.

Tagged you in RES as "ponzi scheme operator" so I remember to downvote and report anything you ever post.

You don't have to be an advocate to be interested in the topic, any more than you have to be a "dollar advocate" to have USD in  your pocket. There's plenty of room for many opinions. We don't all have to circlejerk, and if you're too cowardly to suffer contrary opinions you should avoid contact with other people entirely (well, moreso than you do already)

Y'all *expert economists* should know the most fundamental economic principle: There's no such thing as a free lunch. You invested *something* in obtaining them, whether it's electricity or time.

Another exchange with equally amateurish security practices and no insurance or oversight
The fact that there's no trustworthy place to cash it out has **everything** to do with the security of bitcoin

Are people really that scientifically ignorant that you had to mention that?
@_date: 2011-08-29 18:54:21
Not really.  It's not like Zynga is doing this or something. Nobody plays his game to start with. Making Bitcoin "news" out of himself is a ploy.
@_date: 2011-09-10 01:49:29
Nobody can really be sure, what with Bitcoin being so unreliably unstable
