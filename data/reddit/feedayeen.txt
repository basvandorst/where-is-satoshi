A quick search says shows that any member of the Forbes 250 richest billionaires could buy the majority of Crypocurrency assets if they wanted too. Their combined net worth is smaller than a country like China buying these assets would amount to 0.1% increase in their debt, a few days worth.

No because you always have an analog layer. It's trivial to hook up the audio output jack to a receiver and camcorder releases of movies in theaters are almost DVD quality. They usually just need post processing and audio syncs but the piracy community does that for free. 
10 years from now consumer video cameras will be as good as current movie quality cameras and all you need is one good version to be released before all of your DRM is worthless.

That just means that when I sell my stolen goods, I can do so to a person who doesn't give a damn about how I acquired them. If I was selling locally, I'd be selling to the families I stole from causing problems. The western nations with our high ethical standards are perfectly willing to buy oil from dictatorships.

No. All it takes is 1 guy to set up screen capture software or a freakin' video camera to upload it to the Internet. DRM stops your typical consumer from duplicating the material, they weren't going to do it anyway.

That entire market is almost exclusively illegal activities and purchases. Cash, gift cards and PayPal provide 90% of that anonymity.

I imagine that people would start having a mild anxiety about using such a service too. Imagine one with a 5 hours timeout and a rate of 1 cent per song. Leaving your music running will cost as much as a coffee!
