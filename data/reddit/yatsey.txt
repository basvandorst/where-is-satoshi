What if I'm standing at the top?

I'm not saying socialism is the answer to global politics and happiness. Neither am I saying that what's happening in Venezuela is a disaster.
But to blame it on socialism in its entirety rather than laying some of the blame at the feet running the country is missing the point.

What the hell is your point? And when did I say it was free?

Why did you just link to the doctors strike? Famously executed by doctors not happy with the NHS was run, they were NOT advocating a change of health system. The NHS is  one of the most affordable health care systems in the world, even when it overspends.
Why don't you avoid these whataboutisms?

Alright, you've got me there. Still, free at the point of use is very different from charging people through the nose.

Andoby groups aren't powerful!?
How the hell else do you think they get contracts?

Should I look at America and its ludicrously powerful lobby groups?
The NHS doesn't *make* any of those things, nor does our school system in regards to school books, the awarding bodies for schools are independent, too.
 They all negotiate contracts, like other hopitals/insurers would.

It's free at the point of use. Socialist countries have taxes as well, you know. I don't see what your point is. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:04:26
What? There are plenty of counties out there practicing varying degrees of socialist systems. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 10:20:40
It would be rude just to ignore you completely. I'm British for christ's sake. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 22:39:18
Haha. Okay. There's no point continuing this conversation at all seeing as you can't see how badly your own country is for exactly the kind of behaviours you're trying to pin on mine.

You sound hell bent on bashing socialism and just used whataboutism to try and disparage it.
Just because people are starving doesn't mean free education and healthcare are bad things. The NHS is a huge success in the UK, no matter the state of it. The NHS is a product of socialist thinking.
Take your blinkers off, mate.

WHO rate it as one of the best suppliers of care in the world.
Doctors hate it? I have family members who are doctors, and I know a good few personally, none of whom hate the NHS. They may have a few issues with the way it is currently being run, but the wouldn't change it for an insurance based system in a million years. Quit your bullshit.

 Do Americans have a choice as to which hospitals they use through certain insurers?
How the hell else do you think the NHS gets contracts?
I'm giving up now, neither of us are going to chance minds, and you're so anti-government it's laughable. Yes, some governments are, and can be, bad. But not a of them, and not at everything. If you're so afraid of the government, do you support neo-anarchism?
