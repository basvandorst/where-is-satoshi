Yes, this post is illegal.
~~You're asking people to send .01 BTC to your wallet on the premise that you're running a lottery with no evidence of who you are or if you are legit. From a new blogger account and non-contributing reddit account nonetheless.~~
~~My advice, stick around for a bit, learn some more, and make a more legitimate site based on this idea.~~
~~Before you start, keep in mind that there are already dozens of BTC gambling sites, many of them legitimate, offering lotteries.~~

Hey Tabby, your favorite US pen pal here. Can't wait to finally get my hands on the poster! Hope you're enjoying the ride, going to love hanging that thing up in my living room so everyone who steps inside my house is like *BAM* BITCOIN! 
Keep up the good work man!
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:52:43
What other fee is there besides the default 7% for new users?
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:50:42
+1 for credit unions!
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:01:16
Working fine for me.

Coinbase has weird wait times sometimes. 
When sending from the website I've had to wait several hours for it to even send, never mind the wait from the block.
When sending from the app, the longest I've waited is 30mins.
Did it ask you if you wanted to pay a fee of .0005BTC? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:20:25
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:28:51
Where are you buying sans fees?
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:56:30
Perhaps you should spend less time pimping out Kenneth Parcel and more time reading sidebars:
"Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed...."
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:55:42
That's some nice work
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:30:38
What's the fee with this method?
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:23:50
Thanks for this write up. Yodaman.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:44:17
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:45:54
Gahh, that dreaded last step.
@_date: 2013-11-09 06:32:43
This reads like a scam, I think it's the blanket draped casually over your head. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:45:20
Glad you're excited, these are interesting times and BTC is a fascinating concept. It's also great that you are trying to come up with a more advanced way of earning BTC, please don't let my previous post thwart your ambition.
IMHO, using proper grammar and punctuation, changing that picture to something more professional, not using default template settings on blogger, and being more clear about the stipulations of this lottery in a visually digestible way (read: no walls of text) would be a solid start for today.
his is a great community with a bunch of very clever people hanging around. Perhaps you could post again, but this time from a place of learning and ask for input on how to best proceed with this idea.
Best of luck man!

That's the million dollar question omniVici.

Anyone paying attention to what happened with China doesn't want BTC to be a household name tomorrow. Coca Cola was built slow, steady, and with great insight and calculation. 
We're looking for linear growth, not exponential.
