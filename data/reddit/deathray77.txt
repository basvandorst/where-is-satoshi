Well done sir. 500 bits verify.

This would be great. Ruby or Python would be cool.

Awesome achievement. 1 beer

I do hear what you are saying. A lot of work still needs to happen in cryptocurrencies to hide a lot of what goes on 'under the hood' from everyday users. There is an old adage in Computer Security that says (I am paraphrasing here) that the more complex or inconvenient being secure is, the less likely people are to use it. Take for instance password policy rules that enforce a strong and easily forgot password. So what happens is that the password gets written down which defeats the object of the strong password in the first place. It has been said that, if you liken the evolution of cryptocurrencies to the evolution of the web browser, we are in the 'Netscape' era. Things will move along eventually to the point where it is accessible to all yet still secure. 
Now I have a couple of 'chump change' wallets hosted up in the cloud but they never have more than I am prepared to lose in one go in them. The price of a cup of coffee and a sandwich for instance. No more than 0.05 BTC at any one time. I have my wallet containing the bigger amount right here at home. Safely backed up in more than one place and encrypted. Also the backup is in more than one format. One paper and two electronic. Your wallet is akin to your private keys and I feel safer knowing mine are not stored on a server somewhere. 
Just lately Ebay got hacked and the user database was compromised. Same goes for Evernote and Adobe. All services that I use. I am not saying Coinbase is not secure but then again we thought Ebay was secure and happily linked our Paypal accounts to our Ebay account. So, if your Ebay password was obtained, the hacker could then get at your paypal account. Possibly buy themselves something nice on Ebay and pay with your Paypal. Have it shipped to a dropbox maybe? A nice Rolex perhaps? Something small but valuable... Easily shipped.... Big internet websites get breached like this on a daily basis through so called 'zero day' exploits that attackers use to break into the company website. Sometimes it is the fault of the web designer with some sloppy coding. Sometimes it's the fault of the web server coders. The point is you can't tell and it is hard to track down and fix. I work as a software engineer on big projects that have teams of 10 coders. Each with their own styles and bad coding habits. As software becomes more and more complex, the easier it is for insecure code to creep in.
Having a Coinbase or Blockchain.info wallet is great for everyday use but I would not put more than a few mBTC in it at a time. There are ways of 'having your cake and eating it' though. By that I mean having a good degree of security along with some convenience as well. But it takes some compromise on both sides. You can have super secure but a pain in the butt to use or easy to use but easy to crack. The middle ground is probably something *like* storing your private keys locally and making a paper copy.  I wouldn't consider storing them in the cloud to be near the 'secure' end of the spectrum. 
You are right though. More needs to be done to make security transparent to the user whilst still having the convenience. I am fascinated to see where the field of Cryptocurrencies will go in the next few years.

I flipped it round in photoshop and sent him something too.

That is absolutely disgusting. Have a few bits to start you off. Plenty of people here to give you advice on getting your tips in BTC if you need it.

It's the only flash drive I had to hand. It would fit on a 4GB if you use a thin client that doesn't download the whole blockchain. You can see a tutorial on how to create a bootable linux flash drive -&gt;&gt; [here.](

Install a Linux distro to a flash drive and install a wallet to it. Use full disk encryption on the drive. I use Linux Mint on a 128 GB Kingston Hyper X with Electrum on it. A watch only wallet on my main PC and the full wallet on the flash drive which goes everywhere with me. I can give you more details on how to do this if you like the idea?

I use this method as described on hak5 and store backups on dropbox.

Glad to see our Nepali friends are boarding the moon rocket. Thanks for the uplifting story.
