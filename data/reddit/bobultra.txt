No one makes it. It's just a scam, why would they audit it, and make it obvious to everyone!? They aren't going to shoot themselves in the foot.

Depends. I use beer money. In Norway 0.5L beer in a pub/restaurant costs 160NOK or$20. 
Instead of buying two beer in a pub, I spend $40 on crypto.

 Quote from Wiki: "There is no uniform convention for *bitcoin* capitalization. Some sources use *Bitcoin*, capitalized, to refer to the technology and [network]( and *bitcoin*, lowercase, to refer to the unit of account."
Bitcoin is the tech, and bitcoin is the coin. That's how some see it at least.

Great thinking. 
You get free money, if you work at a company. According to your logic. It's magic. 
Free money everywhere.

No. There is no free money. Your gain are someone's loss.
If you believe in free money, then you are literally an idiot.
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:54:37
Wow, that is amazing
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:53:26
This is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:55:44
Great you finally figured it out. So yeah, according to your definition and explanation it's not free money. 
You are selling goods, that's not free. If you work for it and get paid it's also not free. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 08:15:13
There is no free money, such does not exist. 
Don't be an idiot, don't fall for scams. If someone start talking about free money, run away, it's just scam.

That's literally what we just had. 
I think, you misunderstand many thing.

It's unregulated capitalism, that concept rewards the most fraudulent players.
The market did what it was supposed to do, make selfish people rich, at the cost of others. All is working as indented for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:09:38
The Blockchain is more encompassing than the internet and is the next phase in human evolution. To avoid its significance is complete ignorance.
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:29:04
Why don't you stay on topic.
What you try to do now is called deflection. People without arguments tend to do this. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:08:36
You have to be selfish + fraudulent.
But make sure you move to an unregulated island, before you go full fraud mode. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 13:59:58
Well, you have to be good at math to understand game theory. I think that's your problem.
It's just some simple game theory at play. Liberalism and especially unregulated\-capitalism rewards fraudulent people, as it has no consequences for fraudulent behavior. That's the game of liberalism simplified.
Or in other words, the game of liberalism is: No punishment for fraudulent behavior. No punishment for fraudulent behavior means fraudulent people succeed and take over control of the system. It's pretty simple, if you are good at some higher level math.

Who needs instant payments. That's not what Bitcoin was once about!

U nuts? Wtf did I just read.
Take off your tin foil hat, and think rational, think logical, be free of fear and paranoia.

Pretty  much all types of it have the same flaw. 
That flaw is, that fraudulent people are rewarded (game-theory). That's the problem with liberalism. 
 That very flaw results in fraudulent people getting more power and establishing a totalitarian system. 
Sidenode: The worst type are the so called ancaps or anarcho-capitalists. People who are into that and call themselves that, are 100% brain dead, just retarded. They have no clue of anything. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 12:44:16
That is a natural move of liberalism. (Game theory confirms this.)
In a state free of regulations and rules a totalitarian regime will rise and take all control. That's the true spirit, the final goal of liberatism.
In short: Liberalism is an efficient way to achieve a totalitarian regime, (as it's build upon rewarding the most fraudulent players).

FUD can do no harm to USDT as long as it is backed up 1:1 by USD. 
Whoever believes that that is the case should not worry and the rest shall not use it. It is that easy 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:11:56
Incredible accurate
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:23:58
There is loads of proof for the Tether claims. Seriously. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:33:13
Your account is new. If you are new to crypto. You should spend time and read up on what's wrong with tether , it will help you.

Google is your friend, try it. Spend some hours on it. I'm not going to do your research for you. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:37:44
That's tracking. If they take your data and use it for analytics... then you can call it tracking.

It's too early to say. After every top there is a down and up again. Before the price goes to the floor.
We could very likely be on the 2nd up, right before it drops hard. You don't know that, so don't make assumptions. BTC has shown the very same behavior before, that we do know.
