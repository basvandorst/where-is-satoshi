OP exercises the Fallacy of the excluded middle.  Most likely there is some true Machiavellian scheming, and some accusations are just FUD.
In fact, if there is ANY Machiavellian scheming, then BS would likely create some FUD simply to discredit other claims against them.  
If there is NOT ANY Machiavellian scheming, then they are naive.  Having grabbed so much power to not have any of it corrupted them they would have to be completely innocent babes in the woods.
So the obvious answer is both... leave it to you fine folks to sift through which part is which.

As a Californian, I was VERY displeased to see Jerry Brito advocating for regulating with a horrible assembly bill that Californians would then be subjected to and he wouldn't.  
Any regulation that at the very minimum does not require the regulator to accept bitcoin for its fees is going backwards.
When governments are required to use bitcoin for internal transactions and to have all governments wallets labled so the public can see where the corruption is happening is missing the point of bitcoin regulation.
Bitcoin is far better tool to regulate government than the other way 'round.

Apologies for the brevity.
Rather than rollover, consider whether it would be better to defer, as above.  It may be less risky to defer.  
The proof as suggested above would be the *additional risk of rollover in that it creates an incentive to not include transaction fees in a transaction, and pay the miners directly.*  
The effects of this additional incentive for miners to seek payment outside the protocol could very well be pernicious.  It may encourage cartels.
The "otherwise" is Rollover.  Is there a good reason to do it that outweighs this risk?  Is the inflation schedule as sacrosanct as the total coin amount limit?
With respect to proof.... working code, deployed, in an operational economic crypto-currency, for some years now.  This is a somewhat good standard of proof, possibly even better than an idea being just now being white-boarded.  It may make sense to take a look at it.

DNA hashing is a complicated problem due to the variance in DNA within an organism and the way that hashing works in its pure form (any tiny change, changes the hash)

We agree.  I think we both would like to see this issue fixed, and believe that may be possible to do.  A careful look at improvements rather than knee jerk crisis management is needed.  Its an old problem and one that isn't going to go away (and most of the current proposals aren't good fixes).
Where we ought be cautious is taking a pollyana view that everything will always be great and that nothing needs be done because, the market.   Be wary of short sighted views of folks concerned about the value of their coins today, rather than the protocol in 10 years.  
Good security depends on addressing such vulnerabilities.  Future generations will thank us for getting it right sooner rather than later.
Also concerning is the **lack** of concern of Bitfury/CEX/GHash in policing their hash rate until community uproar presses the issue.  Better would be avoiding even the appearance of impropriety.  The lack of concern of how their market position makes them vulnerable to coercive forces is a second cause of concern.
When this is combined with plausible allegations of block withholding attacks agains the other pools, double spends against gambling sites, and votes of no confidence by developers, it merits prioritization.

This seems more promoting a place to discuss, and filtering through the people is a part of that.  From what I've seen at the CryptoCrypt.org site, its a pretty civilized discussion.  No personal attacks, no trolls, just sharing ideas and developing them with folks that know more than most.

They could be signatures for some message sent out of band.
For example, if you are being watched, but someone else isn't, the non-watched person can take  a bunch of guesses at things and write out some sentences.
The watched person can respond by signing the correct ones with their private key, which you can verify with their public, and thus know which sentences are true.
If a predetermined nonce is also used, then it becomes very difficult for the watched person to be accused of conveying anything in particular.  Could be like a one time pad, say from a book.
I ran some things on this theory, but not come up with anything, so might as well share it.  I was guessing something from "The Little Prince" French version, as he retweeted it incongruously July 31.

The Castle itself is preserved and not fully opened as there are some renovations in progress, but all the meals were served within its chambers and the guests were all pleasant and very well informed on all matters of cryptocurrency.

Thank you for your insights on this.   Consider though that perhaps it might already have been done.
Agree completely that Point of Sale double spends will be swiftly discovered, however... If the counterparty in the 0/unconfirmed transaction is an automated blockchain based gambling dice site, where you can discover immediately whether you win or lose, and a double spend essentially removes the evidence of the original bet everywhere except on the gambling site's own system, this could be happening undetected on a regular basis.
Large banks don't like to publicize when they get scammed either.
But aside from this, the bad actor that gets away with it in the scenario presented earlier is the one that is coercing ghash.io (or any large mining management).  They neither care about ghash.io's reputation, nor are hurt when it falls.  They can do the same to other mine pool owners in turn.
Physical security risks should be an incentive to keep pool sizes proportionally smaller than they are currently, given the valuation.

That criticism is easily managed by limiting the variance.
The difficulty adjustment has the same flaw in that it can be gamed.
There is a non-zero cost to gaming the block size limit, just as there is to gaming the difficulty adjustment.
The difficulty adjustment variance is also limited.  These methods have served Bitcoin for some years now.
In fact I posted an adjustment algorithm that mimics the growth of Gavin's proposal even assuming it is being attacked, just to show that this criticism is silly.
To pick numbers based on an extrapolation means we will just have to keep doing that until we find a more permanent fix.  Using the block chain is the way to do that, because it will be there in the future and be responding to the environment of that time.
The way I see it, if it comes to a crisis, we will get a temporary patch, like  Gavin is suggesting.
If science happens, we will get a permanent fix.
Gavin's proposals are a technicians approach, or maybe an engineer's, what they aren't is science.  They are just the best guesses of the moment based on past data.  They tell us nothing of what the future data will be.  That data will be in the block chain.

With all due respect, this is a poor statement of the threat from a security perspective.  For good security, you do not merely consider what someone is doing, or what they have done in the past, you examine the capability and you do not limit the threat by simply the honor of the person with the capability.
Consider instead what could be done if the owners of ghash.io and a couple other large pools are under coercion.   Consider what might occur if they suddenly discover that their families have been abducted and unless they comply their loved ones will be executed?
Owning a large pool is increasingly subjecting anyone near you to physical threat due to this element of the protocol.  Ignoring it is not any kindness or accommodation to the pool managers, ignoring it may instead threaten their lives.

You have seen this?
(beating gambling sites by censoring the losing bets)
Yes under such circumstances Gyft, or any automatic payment merchant may have issues (though perhaps gyft cards could be centrally defunded?).
We rightly presume honest pool owners, but the threat of coercion against them is a risk both for the pool owners and for such types of merchants.  These risks are often ignored and discounted.  Good merchant behavior will help keep both them and the pool owners healthy and happy by derisking the economic ecosystem.  Pool owners also should do more for their own protection to keep pool size proportionally smaller

That would essentially slow commerce a bit, as more confirmations would be needed.  Point-of-Sale wouldn't work, for example.  Confidence would degrade.  If exchanges react as you predict, that may even degrade confidence further.
This loss of confidence may provide sufficient financial incentive to engage in such an attack of coercion, and so might also broaden the threat from those who wish Bitcoin harm to the merely greedy.
Gavin has some "use only in emergency" code for pool blacklisting/disqualification, but implementing it short of emergency would be worse than what it cures.

You admit to still being confused by bitcoin wikis as late as 2012, so maybe it might take you a while to provide this "basic understanding", but I can be patient.  How will **you** provide an incentive to full nodes, and have these nodes prove on chain that they are fully functional in a simpler manner?
The suggested proposition of lowering cost for nodes here is achieved only by also *lowering their value*.

Once Fees &gt; Coinbase reward, the sighash quadratic issue is no longer an economicly viable attack vector.
The answer for Core is a series of small block size increases until that is reached.
Segwit is orthogonal to the blocksize issue, it is for off-chain scaling.  Pretending otherwise is disingenuous and encourages all that conspiracy talk in the other community.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:36:45
Being outside all three groups (Core, BU, miners) gives some perspectives.
With some empathy from the miner perspective, LN and Coinbase are similar.  There are fees to send to and from Coinbase, just like opening and closing LN TX.
Coinbase increases overall users by creating services users like.
Suggesting that Miners can run LN businesses so they should be happy to move transactions to LN, is sort of like telling them that they can start any new business that cannibalizes their existing business.  They can also start Coinbase competitors, its just not their decision to do so.
Since miners agreement is needed to make LN easier, there is really zero negotiating power outside the miners.
If nothing substantial is offered, it won't move forward.
Just as if Coinbase came to the miners and asked for a protocol change that they wanted (and which the miners see as benefiting Coinbase at their expense), Coinbase would have to listen to what the miners wanted.
This is where BU found some success, it offered the miners some new power and authority, and didn't ask for any commitment from them to support businesses that cannibalize their own.  I'm not so pleased with EC shifting the balance of power, over even just this one parameter, but it should be easy to understand why it will work.  The custodianship of the blocksize parameter by developers has been inadequate from the miners' purposes.
Until that message is heard and understood and answered with something other than "but segwit...", one should not expect them to come to the table to discuss anything, it would just waste their time.
The inability to respect the position of the negotiating interlocutor as equally valid to ones own, ends many discussions without agreement.

False, as you have demonstrated effectively in your prior post.
You should understand that pseudonyms can be attacked ad hominem as it is an attack on the characteristics of the poster rather than the arguments within the post.  The benefit of using a pseudonym is that there is very little character to attack, which you managed to get around with your "Anyone with the most basic understanding" language, suggesting that does not understand at even a basic level.  It is not a statement against the argument, but against the proposer of the argument.  You should drop it from your methods, it is unbecoming for someone of your stature.
Would you like to take this opportunity to apologize for it?  Or if not, why do you think it is OK to talk to people like that?
Moving forward... We seem to agree on the reasons to run a full node.  We also might agree that it is getting ever more difficult to do so, and that this might become a problem.
You have correctly listed a way that a full node can malleate a transaction.  As I mentioned previously, this method would constitute a proof-of-full-node, and not just a pingable host with code on it claiming to be receiving and forwarding transactions, or without ports open to all connections.  Testing for a listening socket is not as adequate a test as would be a malleation proof.  Malleating by modifying the S-value can be done by a full node without the private key, *thus any full node*.  
In combination with an Oracle, this can provide a reward mechanism for running Bitcoin Core full nodes.  They can be paid by creators of transactions just as miners are paid, voluntarily. 
If a bitcoin client, (Such as Bitcoin Core), wanted to reward nodes running Bitcoin Core.  What mechanism would you choose to verify that these nodes are running core, with ports open, and that the node is actively forwarding transactions?
Malleability would be the obvious method.  The problem with an objective treatment of this method however is that the malleability feature is currently being maligned, because it is damaged by the SegWit proposal and the priority of SegWit outweighs everything else, because reasons.
Edit: I'm listening to the talk you gave in SF now.  There are some things you could learn/teach if you care to discuss that talk specifically in more depth.

Suggested by core supporters on IRC.
I do not see "just signal SegWit" as a compelling argument for a miner.  If they are paid to do so, or confused, or have some extra incentive somehow, perhaps they could be compelled.


Yes, and yet they are not slaves to users.  They are free humans that can work or not work as they choose, and work for which users they choose.  Give them better choices and they are likely to take it.
BU is a better choice for miners, that is very easy to see.  It shifts the balance of powers in the system of checks and balances that is bitcoin.


The power shift is over only one fundamental parameter (not properties plural), that in a few years will not matter at all (if it is managed responsibly in that time).  The evidence suggests that it has not been managed responsibly by the development groups, so moving that responsibility to a different authority is less crazy that it would be otherwise.  I am comforted by the fact that max block size will not matter at all, once TX fees per block have grown a bit more.
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:15:10
Or... the first step to incentivizing full nodes could be to incentivize full nodes.
Incentivising full nodes is best done using malleability.
Can't just ping them to see that they are operating, need a full stack method.  If a node can malleate, it is a full node.
Using an oracle, each of these full nodes can anonymously register itself and receive a P2SH payment, if no registered node malleates, the sender can reclaim it.
If this malleation reward mechanism is done by core, it can also create an additional incentive for miners to run core.
Without a direct incentive, eventually the barriers of entry will be too high for most anyhow, unless all scaling is off-chain, and then, why should anyone care about bitcoin full nodes anymore, when you can run an off-chain node and get compensated for that?

How does a node support the network if it does no work toward proof of work?
It isn't like a barrier or anything, to the 2x network, its just like any other computer not running bitcoin.  To the no2x network someone else's node just might get between my TX and a miner slowing down my TX.
So how exactly does a full node support anything?
@_date: 2017-10-05 07:50:10
OK, to restate the same question but using your reference material.... 
In particular this:


Full nodes do not stop the propagation of invalid blocks or transactions any more than inoculated people stop a plague from spreading.  It just protects the inoculated one, the plague still happens because it is so infectious.  Networks work the same way, the invalid TX and blocks just route around mine.  My node isn't a firewall that blocks or segments a network, its just a node.
As a tactic vs hard forks, it seems especially ineffective.  My full node isn't going to do anything at all to prevent 2x blocks or transactions from happening, nor from propagating, is it?   I am running my 0.15 node, and the miners are mining 2x, I just don't see the new 2x blocks and wait for the next 1x block instead.
It might be different if we were trying to do some sort of Distributed Denial of Service attack on 2x, where be take up all their open ports, but 0.15 doesn't do that, it drops the connection instead, right?

The mining subsidy is to bootstrap bitcoin for the first 100 years or so, transaction fees will support the network sometime prior to this.  At first fees were 0% of the mining reward, last year they were about 1-2%, now 3-4% and rising.

Wow Simon, thank you for the positive feedback.  I am not at all disappointed, and I deeply cherish all criticisms and listen to them carefully.  I learn so much from the folks that tell me how they disagree.
This is not a short term project for us.  We are in it for as long as Bitcoin is traded.  We see this as a necessary element of what will make Bitcoin succeed as a viable currency.  Bitcoin NEEDS a specie, a physical money product that can serve the need of the pocket change of the currency and we are dedicated to making the very best possible and making it affordable and useful for everyone that uses Bitcoin.  This is just the very beginning.  
Congratulations on scooping up one of the collectibles too.  The basic pieces are not profitable for us at all, we distribute them at our costs and the collectibles go to help support the expansion of the project.
We have seen folks selling the basic pieces on eBay for 100% profit already so it looks like there is a lot of demand for them.  
The Bitcoin protocol is very much like paper money, only better.  We think there MUST be coins for point of sale transactions, so we want to make those coins, only better than any government coin made today.
More useful, more valuable, more appealing, lower cost, better in any way that we can contemplate so getting any feedback good or bad helps us.
Currently we are looking for regional distributors that would like to assist in getting these into the hands of the people that can use them commercially, bitcoiners.
In addition to the online stores, the people that are organizing local Meet-up groups are an obvious starting point.  The folks doing the distribution will also be rewarded in several ways.
1) They get the better quantity purchase prices (so they make some money).
2) Special collectible editions which will be available to them.
3) A meaningful way to contribute to the success of the Bitcoin project.
4) It is really fun to see the light go on in the faces of people that see them for the first time.  This joy has to be experienced to be understood.

Do you imagine that this is not already occurring with many banks in many jurisdictions?
It is sadly tragic that this coinjoin is so necessary.
The "terrorism/they are out to get us" bugaboo has infected those that gain power from the fearful so much that getting your daily bread is a transaction that must be exposed to the highest levels of government?
One of the benefits of bitcoin is that there ought be no need ever for preemptive transaction prevention under the innocent-until-proven-guilty doctrine.  All the transactions are open in the block chain forever.  Wrongdoing can be traced after there is some wrong, but until then, all this tainting analysis ahead of time is a waste of taxes and unnecessary overhead.

"I only ever send to the first BTC address I ever gor from them"
I was meaning that the problem they were experiencing here is not trading and buying and selling bitcoins using coinbase, (which I agree works as described most often) the problem is from purchasing from a coinbase merchant, or having a coinbase merchant account.
If you only ever send to your own coinbase address (and not to merchant coinbase addresses) you can never have the problem experienced by the complainant here.

We all have both chains, it is not a matter of desire to stay on one or the other.

I wish I could change the name of a reddit post.  :)  I would have already.
I will likely start a new discussion thread at some point, but the darned things keep selling out as fast as we make them so we haven't bothered yet with any marketing much less any social media promotion, and are concentrating on production and quality.
It seems that there is a very strong need for a viable physical currency to accompany the virtual currency in the same way that silver dollars accompanied the dollar in days gone by.
We'll have the gold pieces available shortly as well, maybe after that is out in the market we will re-announce here on reddit.
If you have any particular suggestions for the dramatic rewording they will be taken to heart and likely implemented.  Confusion is our common enemy.  Unfortunately those that are reselling these on eBay seem are also using the word "physical" which seems to be the source of confusion for many.  Perhaps we should call them "tangible" instead?  Or "material"...
The word "Specie" is the proper term for it, but that has lost its meaning in common use so we are working on resuscitating that word into current nomenclature with some success. Likely we will settle on "Bitcoin Specie" and avoid any use of the word "physical" as it tends to capture folks that are looking for the Casasius pieces or one of the other coin shaped wallet type bitcoin containers that we know and love.
For what it is worth, this team is also working on some innovative security features to improve the Casasius pieces and other tamper-evident hologram protected private key containing coins so that they do not fall prey to the exploit demonstrated at the most recent DefCon in Vegas this past summer.  
Our solution for that should improve all "physical" crypto-currency solutions that adopt it henceforth.  We will not patent it nor protect it and make the solution well known and freely available once we have finished testing it.  The coin-making art is what we know best so we are happy to enhance the level of production for all of the others as well.

Bitcoin and paper currency are both serialized.
When they enter and exit institutions that report, those serial numbers are report-able  ATM machines can scan them, bank teller bill counting machines can scan them.  The serial numbers associated with a "know-your-customer" account when received or dispensed.  In this way Bitcoin very closely simulates the way physical paper currency is used.
Contrast this coins.
Coins have no serial numbers, they are not traceable in the same way.  They are not easily marked in non-obvious ways.
The coins-that-are-wallets and which contain crypto-currency within them are serialized and unique (non-fungible).  So we saw a need for a true [Bitcoin Specie piece (precious metal coins denominated in Bitcoin).](  
One problem was the variable nature of the exchange rates, we think [our solution]( for that is a pretty good one, but we would like to hear more about what you think, so that we can improve our solution.

Having a bitcoin value, as well as a date are both very important parts of what make it what it is.
Changing either of those would pretty much defeat the purpose of having gold and silver pieces denominated in bitcoin.  
We will have to work on crafting our messages instead.
In the large world around us, there are still many more people that value gold and silver than there are that value bitcoin.  You are seeing this from the perspective of someone that has already "gotten it", but most of the world is ignorant of what we know about bitcoin and what we see as its future.
In order to achieve that future, we do need to bring the rest of the folks into this understanding.  This piece is designed to be a way to do just that.  
@_date: 2013-10-05 20:07:54
I agree with all of this, except the claim that it isn't feasible.  It is easily within their power, and would be a minor effort.  Very feasible, just not having very desirable effects for them as you very well enumerated.
None of these issues would be any barrier at all to a motivated government entity, or central bank.  Central banks have, as part of their charter, the manipulation of currency rates.  It is part of their job to mess with currency exchange rates in the furtherance of the interests of the currency they are offering.
Bitcoin is a tiny fish, a plankton.  The central banks are baleen whales (the small ones) the big ones are leviathan and could crush the whales if they wanted to do so.
My point is that they don't want to, if they did, nothing we are doing would stop them.  They could end Bitcoin.  The cryptocurrency project could then support a new coin and start over.

The link to bitcoin is pervasive with this piece, as it should always hold some bitcoin value, *based on the silver spot market price in bitcoin*.  It does not contain bitcoins, in just the same way that all specie pieces worked back in the days when money had asset value.
Putting bitcoin inside the piece would pit it against the Casascius pieces which is something we are not going to do.  We are not making Casascius competitors, we are making bitcoin specie.
When looking through the focal lens of modern money, this may seem a bit weird, but it is the way it used to be.
@_date: 2013-09-03 18:46:20
We struggled with the name quite a bit, and this is a common and recurring criticism.  
Fundamentally, there is no such thing as a physical bitcoin.  The bitcoins exist in the block chain, which is only ever data.  The name we are settling on is COLD HARD CASH BITCOINS, but until folks hear that a few times, "physical bitcoin" seems to make more sense to them.
We do make it pretty clear that there aren't any bitcoins inside them.  They aren't wallets (which might be a more apt description of the peel-off one-time use tamper proof hologram physical bitcoin pieces that we know and love).
They are physical, and they are valued in Bitcoin, so while it is accurate, we absolutely do not want to be misleading in any way and we will make it very clear to any buyers so there is no confusion.
@_date: 2013-09-03 18:57:01
Thank you for this excellent feedback.  All criticism is highly valuable for us as we refine this offering, and the communication around it.
1) We do put a bitcoin denomination on them QUARTER BITCOIN) which is not at all misleading.  That is the nominal value of the piece at the time it was created, thus we also put a date on it.
We determined that in 5, 10, 50, 100 years from now it may be interesting for folks to look back at a 2013 piece and marvel at how an ounce of silver was a whole Quarter Bitcoin and not .25mBTC or 25 satoshis or whatever it may be by then.  If you have a US Silver Dollar from 1925, is it totally misleading that it has a one dollar denomination?  We think not, but certainly some people my be confused by this and spend it for one dollar today.  It happens.
2) Yes, the QR will show a mobile friendly page that will show the current value of silver spot price + premium in bitcoin, with also the ability to show it in any other common currency.  We run the site.  This is an ongoing enterprise by the makers of the New Liberty Dollar and we expect to be supporting it and the Bitcoin community in perpetuity.   We are not currently guaranteeing any uptime, and in fact, the value of the pieces really doesn't much depend on the site, but we really like that it is there and is working.  We are committed to bearing the burden of supporting this project indefinitely as our way of giving back to the Bitcoin community and supporting the adoption of Bitcoin worldwide.  If there are those seeking uptime guarantees and are interested in contributing toward that, please feel welcome to contact us.
3) The substantial difference is immediately apparent to anyone who has ever attempted to transact with silver rounds, medallions, silver pieces... well... silver coins.  That is what they are after all.
The first question you will always hear is "what is it worth".  By both putting a nominal value on it (in case you don't have service in the near area) as well as providing the QR link to the current spot market value, we hope to not only answer that for you in your transaction, but also to provide some confidence in the mind of the person receiving it that they will be able to also trade it forward to the next person.
@_date: 2013-09-03 20:44:51
As students of monetary history and the Bretton Woods problems, a "fixed" price for gold or silver only works for warehouse receipts but not for any currency.  What is needed is a flexible gold standard.  Bitcoin's potential to be this is unrivaled due to its nature.  It is uninflatable in the same way that gold and silver are.  
Bretton Woods taught the world the folly of pinning a currency to a fixed amount of a commodity and trying to maintain that when there will always be external factors to influence the pricing.
So by combining the flexible standard from "the market" via the QR linked exchange rate, and the value emblazoned on the pieces we achieve what Bretton Woods couldn't, a flexible standard.

You are referring to the US government shutdown?
The profiteers on the US government shutdown are the US politicians who get to be at the center of the news.  This is the "crisis de jure", such crisis are engineered in order to get donations from the political donation class.  
The government shutdown is not a big deal, it isn't saving much money for the US government, and not much is really shutdown, it is just window dressing... but it generates a LOT of donations for the politicians.
People outside the US are generally insufficiently cynical to understand this and mostly think that the US are goofy fools who can't even let their government decide who lives and who dies without shuttering the parks first.  Who knows, maybe they are right.
Bitcoin is an innocent bystander in this.
@_date: 2013-10-05 11:05:00
The power of government is vastly underestimated here.  If a government wanted to 70% the Bitcoin network it would not be a big project for them.  About the same as building a few kilometers of railroad or so.
A chip fab plant within their geography may find their business license depending on their delivering new ASICs designed for the purpose, assembled onto cards and distributed into government offices.
In many geographies, the government employs 20% of the population or more (like USA).  Today less than 0.01% of people mine.  The network would be swamped.
A billion dollars is practically a round-off error in the national budget.  The scale of difference is being ignored.
It is VERY clear that governments are not trying to stop Bitcoin today.  If they were, it would be stopped.

It is interesting from a technical perspective, and well done for your researching effort, but there is the question:  Why would anyone even want to do this?
Bitcoin is an innocent bystander, until it does this sort of weird activity against its own self interest for a minor political action.

This would be bad ethically, even if you believe it right politically, the end ought not justify the means.

Yes, apps can be made.
We may do that at some point.  I believe there are some already that do almost this (check out shire silver!)
The swiftest way to support all platforms is with a site.
We have contemplated doing this and marketing it to other communities, but the Bitcoin community is the savviest, hard money community that can find their way around a QR code.  The Bitcoin community should be the first to have this capability.  When we were asked to create this when we attended the first Bitcoin Foundation conference, we did some soul searching to see how to do it in the best way possible, worthy of the Bitcoin community.  This is our initial effort at that.
Also we think it is a good way to introduce folks to bitcoins that don't have any yet, but are already familiar with silver and gold.
@_date: 2013-09-03 20:01:38
They are bullion, valued in bitcoin.  But they are not just intended to be ornamental, or commemorative or merely celebrating bitcoin.  They are those things, but that is not the primary purpose of them, and describing them in that way would not be helpful.
They are intended as bitcoin specie.  They are not to sit in drawers or on shelves or display cases, but to live in pockets, as the "small change" of bitcoin.
Buying them is not "investing in bitcoin" but using them, in a way is doing so because it can help to expand the bitcoin economy, to make it more common.  There are a lot of folks that use silver and gold for tranactions because it is easily recognizable in person.
Nothing will ever be as good as bitcoin for internet transactions, but at point of sale transactions, bitcoin needs help and this is our offering to make that easier while both avoiding fiat currencies as well as bridging the divide to those that are only familiar with them and "think in dollars/euros/etc".

When you put money inside of something, that thing that you put the money in is usually called a wallet, rather than a coin.  We could do better and list more of the things that this isn't, but we risk confusion in doing that as well.  Confusion is always a risk, and it is one that we take very seriously.

That was sort of a nonsense question, they should have responded:  "THERE IS NO ENCRYPTION IN THE BITCOIN PROTOCOL."
Importantly, the general ledger is not encrypted at all, it is public, and readable (requiring no subpoena) and it is also hashed (it has forensically verifiable integrity).

By increasing the trade volume of bitcoin transactions using specie, in the same way that a floor value is created by high volume sales of a stock at a particular price.  
That these transactions happen off the block chain is of additional benefit to bitcoin (the benefit of avoiding block chain bloat).
Bitcoin value is likely to rise over time but by expanding the economic activity that transacts in bitcoin, that rise can be smoothed.
Fundamentally, the more things that are primarily "priced in bitcoin", the more the bitcoin economy grows.

We have other pieces that are selling well enough.  It wasn't until we were asked to do this by the bitcoin folks that we considered it.  It is a significant effort to bring out new pieces.  Our concern is that there just aren't enough Bitcoin users to make this worth while, and with the hostility toward doing it we are receiving, it makes us wonder if we are better off making an Obama commemorative or something equally banal that will sell more.  
But thick skin and asbestos underwear for the flames may carry us through the hard days because it looks likely we will lose money from doing this for quite some time to come. 
@_date: 2013-09-03 20:28:23
Thank you again for this feedback, very useful!
Yes, specie.  These pieces are linked to a current spot value of silver in bitcoin through the use of the QR, so that you will always know their value in bitcoin.
By a floor value, if these were in wide circulation, they would help keep the bitcoin value at or above 4x the silver price in 2013.
No so farfetched...Many many transactions are done with silver and gold coins.  This has been done for many centuries.  Personally, I've done more transactions with coins than with bitcoins, but that may change someday.
By anonymous, I mean true anonymity, not the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin which is stored in the block chain forever and tied to a particular address.  Bullion is perfectly anonymous, each piece is exactly like all the others.  Paper currency has serial numbers, bitcoin is also cryptographically unique, bullion is not at all unique, it is entirely fungible in a way that neither fiat nor bitcoin are fungible.  The Casascius pieces are also serialized and unique, and we do not want to compete with them in that, we like what they are doing and hope for their continued success.  We are doing something different.
Serialization makes a thing unique and trackable, so yes, bullion is by nature more anonymous than bitcoin.
We will take your feedback to heart and continue to refine the messages.

As a bonus, your boss can start paying you in bitcoin now too.
Buying more company t-shirts soon, do you do custom?

Yes, this one was an awesome segment.
He stumbles over the terms, but he captures the essentials, and the spirit.
He shows what it is like to "get it" for the first time.  It is heart warming.

Is is interesting that even though the LEOs were on the Silk Road Server they didn't bother to intervene when there was a conspiracy to commit a murder, so long as the captain of the silk road was busily accumulating bitcoin (for them).  They waited until what was the last possible minute for them to profit from the Silk Road enterprise and get the most possible bitcoins from it in the seizure.  They waited until DPR ordered and received counterfeit travel documents before making their bust, as then he would have been outside the jurisdiction and they wouldn't have their 180K bitcoin.

Thanks for that

Small difference: CC needs one party (payee) with an asynch connection vs BTC needs two party (payer + payee) with internet access.

Premiums are reduced today due to the rise in bitcoin/silver.  For Details:

Matt Miller was the right person to pick for this assignment.  His open mind, curious enthusiasm tempered with reasoned analysis, a cool head and the ability to think outside the box have made him a bitcoin hero.

More than a few, myself, but this is a pretty temporary effect, buy some more while you can get them.  When viewed in the historical context of the effect this sort of thing would have had previously, it is almost a non-event....  And that is a gold lining.
Now that Bitcoin is in no way dependent on some nefarious darkweb clusterbuggering, it can step into the light fearlessly.
Once this is blown over, it will be more legitimate than ever and increasingly acceptable.

They are professionals at the law.  Having a professional on your side when they are gathering evidence against you from what you are saying is not really a bad idea.

You are helping us be "Up Front" with your comments, that is our goal.  
You are helping to refine our message so that we include "what it isn't" as well as "what is is".
We would not be able to do this effectively were it not for the helpful criticisms from you and folks like you.

Yes, this is possibly a dirty tactic by that mint to cloak itself in Bitcoin when they had almost nothing to do with Bitcoin, and didn´t even accept Bitcoin payments.
Don´t need to take any action against Capital One for this. 
BUT... If you are looking for Silver Bitcoin currency pieces (specie) you can get some that look a lot better from Bitgild.com who are selling the ColdHardCa.sh pieces.

I thought they had finally made it through the backlog and were now shipping almost immediately?
Has anyone made a recent order?
Though mining now is not so lucrative as it once was.

My guess was Doro Wat, an Angolan dish (the lat-long coordinates point to Angola)

Bitcoin is in beta.  These are the early days.  It will get much easier and more robust over time.  Welcome to the outer ring of the inner circle :)

There is an appropriate level of caution.  Having someone well versed in local law on your side is not bad advice.  Consider:  On which side of that trial would the police be on, the prosecution or the defense?
In some places there are people that lie when there is money at stake.  Some of these people might wear uniforms.

A few other ideas for "Bitcoin Health"
Number and geographic diversity of full nodes running in hardened facilities.
Strength of cryptocurrency competition (no competition is bad, too much may also be bad too)
Diversity and independence of development resources.
Diversity and independence of infrastructure (this is part of what you are getting at with the concern about mining cartels)
Amount of "use" vs amount of "investment"
Defense scenarios, and war-gaming.  What does it look like when it is under attack, what options are likely to work/fail.
People can be bought, idealists can be slain, many are anonymous and so there is little "authority", this is a strength as well as a weakness.  How is this exploitable for us and for TPTB?
Is there a better reward system than awarding blocks to pools, can a cryptocurrency be designed that is "pool-proof"?
Some thoughts to consider if you are going down the road of long term thinking and currency maturation.

The transactions are confirmed in the public block chain by the "miners" along with the transactions of everyone.  Nothing special.  People can pay you without revealing their identity, but those transactions are in the public block chain forever so there is a permanent record of them.
Soundbyte for you:
The block chain is like a giant public general ledger that you connect to and move your ledger entries to the control of other folks.

Tom Keene will come around.  Everyone does eventually.  Bitcoin just too much fun.

The ATM is easier to use than their video camera, apparently.

You are just peeking in to the rabbit hole.  It goes very deep.
Thanks for choosing the red pill.  It is going to be a fun adventure.

And network effects.  There used to be very few people with whom to exchange email.
(Where do you spend your bitcoin?)

This has nothing to do with bitcoin.  The company Mulligan Mint filed bankruptcy and is involved in fraud cases.  Capital One is just protecting itself against more fraud or the mint not paying its debt.  It is a reporting fail by CoinDesk, but I don´t blame them, the fault is likely with this mint.

Decentralized, P2P, on .onion.
Thank you for organizing this.

One of the folks that bought some of these early is selling them on eBay.  It looks like he is doing well there, they are selling for upwards of US$50 ea.
I like that the [photographs he took]( are scannable from a QR reader.
We are looking for additional regional distribution globally.  So if you are outside the USA and would like to make money, do some good for Bitcoin, and have some fun, please feel welcome to contact us.
