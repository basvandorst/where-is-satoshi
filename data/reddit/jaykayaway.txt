Yes, it is great on one side, but not so great on the other (when you make silly mistakes). 
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:13:13


OK, will do so. I have several backups of my multibit wallets. None of them show a second wallet. But I will look anyway.


The transaction came straight from my localbitcoins wallet.

Creating an account from mobile does not work. Need to visit coinjar.io

Unless something/someone messed with my machine and the address pasted was not the one copied. But that is pretty unlikely I guess. Also, I (believe) I always double check at least the first 2 and the last 2 digits of the address.
@_date: 2014-07-13 09:30:59
And when you pay they charge you easily a 14% fee. E.g. loading up your mobile card or paying your TV. Sorry, what is so great about those Qiwi ATMs again?
@_date: 2014-07-02 18:50:25
Looking forward to finally putting my bitcoins to use. Felt kind of miserable hearing about all the companies accepting BTC in the US, and no opportunity to participate here in Russia. Keep those good news coming. ;-)
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:50:52
The only thing that gets me thinking is: Is it actually a good idea that we rather have merchants pay us back in the USD amount than in the BTC amount?  If we want the amount in USD, then we really do not accept BTC as a means of value, but simply as a medium of exchange.  If we paid a merchant in Europe in EUR, we would also get EUR back, and not the equivalent in USD. So why do we rather want to get the USD amount back when we actually pay in BTC?
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:24:56
I have to say that it feels darn good to hear such educated words out of a politicians mouth. This gives me a lot of hope.
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:08:51
It is exactly as you point out. It should all be about going through all services and checking the balances. This is what I did. This is why I am confused myself. But the transaction was sent directly from localbitcoins to the mentioned address. And from localbitcoins I never sent any btc to anyone, but to my own wallets. Should make things easier to locate them one would think. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:55:20
Just saw your reasoning in a comment you made below: THAT would indeed be a wired concept charging VAT for the bitcoins you use to pay for other goods. :-(
@_date: 2014-11-19 08:16:50










OK, I checked this. The paper wallets were imported to blockchain and then transferred to mytrezor much later than that transaction occurred. And I never used paper wallet btc for purchases or other transactions. :-( Got to keep thinking. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 06:10:26
I will keep that thought. Maybe by the time btc hits 1,000,000 that possibility exists. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:49:11
You do not sound patronizing. I take any advice, as patronizing as it might be. :-) 
@_date: 2014-07-08 05:11:25
Why did you have to beg Overstock?
@_date: 2014-07-07 09:25:37
If he/she was reading any of this here, he/she would have never posted this article on your shop window. :(
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:17:25
Or it will incentivize merchants to not exchange BTC into fiat anymore, but to use BTC to purchase other goods in return. As a consequence it will motivate merchants to hodl and drive the value of BTC up. (OK, not super likely but I like the sound of this :-))
@_date: 2014-07-15 12:45:27
Man, accepting bitcoin was the best investment you ever made for your company. Without it you would have never received any of the advice that you got from the comments in this reddit. 
How many orders did you get in total in the past 8 months? I would not be surprised if your bitcoin sales would total 20% of your total volume. AND THAT would not be such a bad result after all. :-)
@_date: 2014-06-08 17:31:29
May I ask, what you do not have the time to check for? What piece of information would you want to read in order to make a buy or sell decision? At this point we all understand the risks in holding bitcoins (having them stolen, not getting into the mainstream payment method, 51% attack, etc.) This will not change in the short run. So, there is no need to follow up daily or even multiple times during the day on bitcoin and its development. Keep them, or sell them. At this point it is in any case a gut feeling proposition, and not one based on daily news. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:49:54
Well, could be, indeed. Checked it on blockchain and nothing has happened with that amount after I sent it to that address.
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:36:53
Well, the problem is rather that if you have savings, you need to find a fungible store of value. If you do not have any savings, well, then you need rubles to pay your daily bills. Dollars will not help you when you go to buy food. The tanking of the ruble against other currencies is currently not a problem for Russians in their daily life. It will start becoming a problem once companies will start hiking prices to not sell below costs. Which will start in Jan/Feb 2015 for the most part.
@_date: 2014-07-07 12:57:35
So, then I guess we will actually be seeing the $10/BTC soon. Prof. Williams will be right after all.
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:43:07


Well, with time based release of assets, like nlocktime, you could pre-sign a transaction. You could be reminded about this and if you do not respond any more, the transaction would be executed. The same you could probably do with the specific distribution you are referring too. Unfortunately I am not so deep into the tech of bitcoin, but I see similar concepts currently being deployed for consumers in the bitcoin as a currency space.
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:06:10
In the end you have to take it one step at a time. An increase in transactions means that we are on the right track. Moreover, individuals transacting in bitcoin also means that they will hodl a few more then they spend, maybe for the next purchase, or for speculation. Although the current charts look like we are already in the growth phase, my personal feeling is that we are still quite some time away from the hockey stick phenomenon. The steep growth bit is only to start in the future.

True, but if I finally decided to offer it to the public I would put it on my donation page. Otherwise what would be the purpose of offering it at all. 
It is of course their choice but it simply does not make sense to me to hide such a feature. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 09:23:48
And: The headline of the newspaper article is not correct. The correct phrase would be: The European Banking Authority (EBA) has published an ‘opinion’ warning financial institutions to stay away from digital currencies **until the industry is regulated.**
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:23:51
I guess that is what I will do. In total I thought this should not be too difficult as I keep all my access information stored. So a) I would be able to easily identify the services I tried, and b) have all the access data readily available. But I guess taking a pen and paper might invoke a different thought process. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-11-04 16:26:18
And what is your point??
Great Blockbuster is better in a dying business model (DVDs), Facebook is recording record sales and profitability with still more than 1 billion users. Uber is pushing taxis services to innovate and offer consumers a better service and experience, Apple has a smaller market share in hardware, but kills all other manufacturers (Microsoft, Android, etc.) on profitability on each single device and with their revenues from apps. 
If you focus on the wrong metrics no wonder that you do not understand the potential of Bitcoin vs. WesternUnion. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 08:24:32
Not showing in the German App Store so far. I will keep rechecking.
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:52:36
The strange thing is that I (believe) that I always checked that amounts that I sent between wallets also arrived to the receiving address. So, I am still left with the hope that I simply forgot to check one of the wallets that I tested. On the other hand, the amount is too big that I would have sent it to a hot wallet. Which would leave me with the more trustworthy online wallets like blockchain or coinbase. But those wallets are virtually empty. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:57:56
Sorry, I WAS saying RUB 2000 (confusion because of . vs ,).

Until yesterday you could withdraw dollars and euros from the ATMs in Moscow. Not sure they will allow this much longer. At Sberbank people were queuing to withdraw dollars.
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:59:09
Good idea. will check this, maybe it will ring a bell. (Hopefully!) All this anonymity works great, too great, in this case. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:25:58


I was afraid to hear just that, but it is good to know, finally! Thx.
The rest of your recommendation I will follow. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:48:17
Yes, it does make a difference. Only when they convert bitcoin to fiat they incur the additional 19% tax that you talk about. If the hodl and buy other goods or pay suppliers with bitcoin they only have to pay regular VAT without the additional tax for converting. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 12:16:21
Totally support your argument. I currently live in Russia and the Ruble devalued more than 50% in the last year. Not sure if Putin will accept my recourse. Or Mastercard, which is my payment processor in Russia.
@_date: 2014-12-01 06:50:54
I have to disagree. This is not about promoting bitcoin, it is about making it easy for donors to contribute. I also expected them to list bitcoin on their donation page. I could not find it, so I did not donate. 
It is not up to me to google for how to donate properly but for Mozilla to make it easy for me. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:35:14
Seriously agree. I would not go through the hassle to drag this anywhere. They will find a way to pick this up.
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:53:26
... but I liked the sound of it :-)
@_date: 2014-07-08 12:56:02
True, I do see those issues. But like jrm2007 stated, it would be great if some products would really show BTC prices. At the current market volatility it is almost a stable price.
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:34:39
Hi gets it, but he is trying to save his job. What a dilemma. I even believe that he is privately investing a ton of money into bitcoin to benefit from the upcoming tsunami, which will hit his business and his entire industry.
@_date: 2014-08-13 05:12:39
Pretty bad piece of lobbyism IMHO. The only good sign about this is, that apparently some people are seriously getting scared by the traction bitcoin is showing and they see the need to take drastic counter actions.
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:32:43
When I listen to this, it provides me with the pleasant sensation, that we are winning the battle against the established financial system. The arguments get weaker and weaker and the screams (interviews, articles, etc.) become more frequent. Those are all good signs for bitcoin. 
Keep those videos coming. It is a sign of a times! 
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:57:36
Well, I do not think that I was still so much in the testing mode when I moved 10.09. Such amounts I would only between paper, mytrezor, blockchain, or localbitcoins. Another good point: If they are not in any of those wallets, then u/xzclusiv3 is probably right, that the address was probably generated when I sent it.
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:55:28


Well, it is the address to which I sent the btc from my localbitcoins account. It is recorded in my transaction log from my account.
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:45:36
You should save that screen and look at it again in 3 years. It will be hilarious to review those "fake money", "nobody needs them" comments in hindsight.  
@_date: 2014-12-04 17:48:57
In general you are right. In German most words ending in "e" require the particle "die" (e.g. Katze, Brille, Sonne, Welle, etc. ).
In this particular case Germans mean "the Mastercard card", where card (German: Karte) has the particle "die". 
If we were to refer to the company Mastercard, there would be no particle. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 14:07:02
Agreed: User to User works. But paying for services is an incredible rip off. Here bitcoin would be a much preferred option for me. 
Qiwi is fast and anonymous: but is it worth paying such high premiums for this antiquated system. I rather make my service payments through other means (ATMs for topping up mobile phone cards, or bank transfer for TV) as those payment options carry no surcharge. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:03:56
Thanks. Have been doing so for the past two days. Even reconciling transaction addresses from the various wallets. So far to no avail. :-) 
@_date: 2014-08-23 15:53:44
Just saw your reasoning in a comment you made below: THAT would indeed be a wired concept charging VAT for the bitcoins you use to pay for other goods. :-(
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:49:43
True. shouldn't rule anything out.
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:27:04
In addition: I somehow believe that I created a second wallet with Multibit besides the Main wallet. But in all my backup files there is no such second wallet backed up. I guess all that thinking about where I screwed up is playing with my memory. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:47:45
Fully agree. Partially I am still spoiled by the old banking system, where every transaction is recorded and even sent to you on paper at the end of the month.
@_date: 2014-07-15 12:18:42
Simply top up your MTS mobile phone via a Qiwi ATM. RUB 2.000 paid, around 1.750 arrive. The rest goes to fees. 
Try the same with AKADO for your TV. Around 10% fee taken by Qiwi. 
I am not arguing with you about user-2-user I am just arguing that bitcoin needs to disrupt this mafia style robbery for cash payments.
@_date: 2014-11-19 08:23:08
Be careful here: Nowadays CC companies might refuse your payment order. Knowing that most of your transactions recently were made 8.000 miles away from that location, they might assume that someone is illegally using your card and will simply block this. Happens to me regularly as I currently live in Russia and sometimes I want to pay for something in Germany, they refuse the transaction as most of my purchases are done 2.000 miles away. In that sense btc is more reliable. 
Also: I am not sure if you could just tell your girlfriend your cc details on the phone, which she then tells to the cashier, will do the trick as swiftly as sending a QR code and receiving payment.
