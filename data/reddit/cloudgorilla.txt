Shhh what are you doing? BCashers are going to throw a fit again. "But but big bloxxs"

Bitcoin does currently not protect our privacy. Unfortunately.
On the other hand I reckon that with the privacy property it would have already be banned because of "evil drug dealer/tax evader/terrorist money" myth. And this would prolong it's adoption right now. We need fiat ramps at the moment.
I hope there is going to be a protocol update after bitcoin has established itself to fix this issue.
Bitcoin is the hardest currency on the planet and it's digital and global and every bull run pulls in more people. I'm not worried at all.

Yes, I also assume the possible combinations of colors, facial features, hats, items, etc will never be enough to cover all combinations of a bitcoin address.
But it helps tremendously to get a first impression if an address might be the right one (getting coins from a recurring sender or sending coins to somebody from the address book).
For reaching a bigger (non-tech savvy) crowd stuff like this has to be done ihmo. This 1Nh7uHdvY6fNwtQtM1G5EZAFPLC33B59rB is even worse than a 1234 5567 3332 2222 creditcard or 12-1233-12 bank account number.

Sometimes I also have this moments of thinking; this technology is so absolutely amazing and cool! Now we have micro-payments enabled by Bitcoin. It's still in its infancy, but we can see where it is going. Give it a few years and this technology is going to be used everywhere.

Good point. Maybe a combination of a visual representation and the last couple of characters might be a solution. I'm also lazy to check the whole address. I copy&amp;paste it and then I check the first few and last few letters but not much in between. If something malicious changes the middle letters I would send the coins into the abyss.

Why did Roger become so frustrated and narrow minded? He was the opposite when he made his investment in Bitcoin years ago. Now he just clings to the past.﻿ Sure LN has problems, sure it's not ready yet. Give it time. Mass adoption in a decentralised way is not possible with Gigabyte blocks.

1.) No you're not in possession of a "cold or hard" wallet. The App on your phone is a hot wallet because it's exposed to the internet. A cold wallet is not exposed to the internet (paper wallet, disconnected computer that never gets connected again). A hard wallet is a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano, or Trezor or BitBox.
2.) It depends on the amount. The most secure option is a hardware wallet but they come with a price ~$80. For smaller amounts a wallet on your phone is good enough. 
Have fun exploring bitcoin. The most you learn is playing with the technology. Enjoy!

Nimiq uses a clever simplification similar to Chernoff Faces. It's so easy to validate an address like this:

Sacrificing decentralisation to be able to pay coffee on-chain is so stupid. Increasing the block size is the simple solution of simple minded people.

This is a reality which is far far far away. 
Miners decide every day if it’s worth mining bitcoin. At the moment it looks like that mining is profitable the hash rate is growing. 
Every halving (the next is in a couple of months) the miners will evaluate again if it’s worth mining bitcoin or not.
So instead of asking what’s going to happen in 120 years, focus on what’s happening now.

They are making business with bitcoin but working against it. Then crying around about high fees. Hypocrites they are.

Roger Ver is the owner of bitcoin(dot)com and he is scamming people by selling them BCash instead of Bitcoin.

I also did it and received my Bitcoins. Amazing and so easy to get rich quick!

Everything or as much that you worry all the time.

Just buy a hardware wallet if you have an amount that's worth to be protected by spending $50.
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:25:37
Does it matter? Bitcoin is the hardest money mankind ever invented and going to be much more expensive in the future.
@_date: 2019-09-22 17:30:23
Okay I stay corrected :-)
It's a good feeling to know unless you lose the seed nobody can steal your coins while doing a transaction (unless you send them to a wrong address). 
With using a mobile wallet or even worse paper wallets you have to trust a third party or yourself (that you don't mess up).

There's also BitBox2, a Swiss engineered wallet:

Install this version of the Desktop app:
(you'll find the download links to the executables below)
Then upgrade your Ledger Firmware 1.3.1 to 1.5.x with it.
@_date: 2019-05-05 10:42:06
 From the v1.8.0 release notes:
firmware 1.3.1 needs Ledger Live 1.7.0 to upgrade.
Ledger Nano S that are still on firmware 1.3.1 will not be able to upgrade in this Ledger Live 1.8.0. Please rollback on Ledger Live 1.7.0 to apply the firmware update.

Peter Schiff will never turn around. Members of older generations need to die, their mind is set and cannot be changed by arguments. Maybe when Schiff gets robbed at home
and his Gold in bank accounts gets confiscated his opinion will get changed. So far he has to protect his business and being controversial is free marketing for him. Stop
arguing with dinosaurs (although I really appreciated the clever arguments of Ammous).
