Hi there, thanks for leaving this message. I have been speaking with Ryan, cool guy, he's helping where he can. Thanks again for helping :)

Yep, exactly what it is. 
I grabbed all the dotcoms associated with the address that [currently holds the coins]( as a way of hoping one day it might attract his attention.
This post, that website, it's about all I can think of. After today, until those coins are moved on to another address I don't own, I'll keep those dotcoms active in the hope he might see them and communicate with me.

I really believe he might, they are our coins. He did reach out once before back in July 2015 and I just missed it. This post, the website etc. it's just a frustrating game of trying to attract his attention. 
If he wants to keep them, fine, move them onto another address and I'll take down the webpage and move on... But while they sit on that address I still have hope and would love to chat to the guy.
Anyway this post is done, the website is done, I've got email notifications on all the addresses etc so if he does contact me I'll be straight on it... That's just about everything I can think of... I'll go back to obscurity and write a nice thank you post if they ever do get returned.

Hehe, I was literally trying to keep them from myself! I had a thing for satoshidice which was very unhealthy.

Yeah, it may be wasted effort, but I have to try. 
Oh and I don't blame my wife mate, she's awesome. All I asked her to do was think of a phrase so she knew the password and not me. I was in the habit of gambling all my btc (I drank a lot at the time) and wanted to keep some safe.

That's the point mate, they haven't. They sit exactly in the same place they were first moved four years ago. 
Also if you read the website linked at the top, you'll see in 2015, 2 years after taking them he reached out and tried to give them back, I just missed the messages!
If the coins move on, dissolve etc. I'll also move on with my life. In the meantime, this post and the website will hopefully act as a way to grab this chaps attention again.

thanks for the tip, I didn't know about this guy and it does fit his profile!!!
@_date: 2017-10-07 13:19:50
I was the one who couldn't be trusted! Hence the reason I was trying the give her control. 
My biggest mistake was not explaining to her enough about what makes a decent passphrase. I tried explaining "correct horse battery staple" but should have asked her to show me her first attempt at making a phrase.

I'll show the full story on 23/10/17 in a new thread, but basically, the coins were swept, I left a message using blockchain public notes within 10 mins. Then in July 2015 he sent back a few satoshis saying something similar to "do you still control the original address? if so I'll return the coins". I didn't notice this message for well over a year and by this point the messaging system in blockchain info has been removed. A few months after this they even removed all the old messages. I need to find a way to contact blockchain.info and ask for an archive or something.
Anyway, I plan to tell the whole story on 23/10/17 - exactly four years since I lost them. This first message was really just to set up the throwaway reddit account.

I would be more than happy with whatever stipulations he has.
This post today and that website will live on now, I've done everything I can think of to contact him after I missed his communication in 07/2015. So he's got my email etc.
If I get a resolution, I'll happily post an update. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:28:41
thanks for this, I've messaged him via Reddit a couple of weeks back but heard nothing. I didn't know about his bitcoin talk profile. A quick five mins look (I'm at work now) shows there is quite a rabbit hole of info I could look into via that account. 
Thanks again for the tip @_date: 2017-10-24 20:54:27
Yep, and now I'm just trying to attract his attention. Without that public note system on blockchain.info, this post and the website linked will hopefully open up a means of communication if and when he sees it again.
