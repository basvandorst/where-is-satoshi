BITCOIN CASH IS NOTTA BCASH OKAY?

Lol, he's such a moron.

I think it's realistically 0.5 - 1% of the Western population.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:16:10
That's nothing yet.

Too hard for you to read a metastudy? Poor little sheep.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:59:40
I just did. Worked quite well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:06:21
That's irrelevant cause the profits are not enough to make a difference. What makes a difference is dependant on the average costs of living in your country. If all you had was 1 Cent and someone gives you 9 Cent, you could call it a miracle, but the truth is that it's just irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:32:23
Probably not gonna happen anymore. And it was USD 3000 down. The next years will probably have exytreme growth when multiple fiat systems fail.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:33:28
The bubble will definately pop when 21 million bitcoins are minted.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:33:44
It's legit but I think it sucks. I only use it when a coin is nowhere else.

Do your reasearch, there's no correlation historically, not before 1958, and no longer since a couple of years. It's all lies to get money and control economies, the population, the birth rates and even where your car may drive to in the future.

Don't kid yourself. If you have 10$ and it goes 10x, then that's still just 100$. You can buy yourself 10 Happy Meals then. The truth is that investing really just makes sense if you have some money.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:14:44
Funny thing is that BCH is also just bought to make money, noone is using any crypto whatsoever to make real life payments at this point. And when that time comes lightning will be ready for btc making bch obsolete before it could even be used a single time.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:58:39
Sure it is. Fiat money from the whole world is flowing into it. We've seen nothing so far in terms of volume. You don't need 60% dips for a correction. This "testing the resistance" is bullshit from Noob Vays and so on.

Dude, you're stupid as fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:45:31
Wouldn't matter much because W. Europe has such a low investment in cryptos. And it'll never happen under Trump in the US. If the powerful people in the world really wanted BTC to go away it would be long gone by now.

You can find the answer to that question in the metastudy that Obummer got his 97% from.

I still don't believe you, but NEVER share any funds info on reddit, unless your reddit account has an email address separated from your other stuff or you become a target.

@_date: 2017-12-16 22:42:05
Nah, almost no real scientist believes that. Just those who get paid to for positive climate change "research". Go on a funny adventure on the internets and find out how that 97% number came to be.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:04:31
Use bitstamp for EUR buys. Kraken should have their new interface however this month, maybe things will work better then.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:22:11
How did you get the idea it's 5%. It should be far less than that.

Low volume at Hitbtc - Those numbers can EASILY be manipulated if you had an interest in doing so and just invested like 100k USD for pushing it up. Doesn't say anything. Ask yourself if anybody would do that and how likely it is :)

If China doesn't get back into bitcoin, the next crash may be hacking of exchanges in epic proportions. If other governments want to damage cryptos the same.

@_date: 2017-11-18 10:46:06
You should learn some Dutch and then get back onto the website. You can do it.

Maybe that's where Bitconnect sits.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:00:31
Nah, another 60% to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:41:15
Not possible. Once they'll start readin into it they'll figure it out for themselves. At the latest when their coins drop to shit.

It was a joke. Never fork your stocks. And DON'T buy Bitcoin Gold.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:59:58
It's derived from special interest buying into the futures and pushing the price up, so that folks out there think the actual coin will be worth a lot, while in reality it'll be in the shitter.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:00:54
It's a bug or some penny trade, it shows no volume.
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:54:12
And what did the message say?
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:09:27
And just simultaniously open an account elsewhere, bitstamp.net for example if you want to buy in EUR. Maybe that works quicker.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:32:59
By default 4x faster block time and there's already consensus that block size gets increased whenever needed. The rest of the scaling will be same as btc (LN etc) to keep it one ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:37:08
My bet is after the CME decision many Americans wanted to buy themselves some nice bitcoins, read about it on bitcoin.com and thought this is the real deal. Coinbase alone had 100k new users yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:55:05
It's like that since months. They don't seem to care too much. Just move to a better exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:35:20
"lately"? Good joke.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:47:14
I don't know if this is good publicity for btc.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:16:55
Really good. I'll try it out in the coming days. Looks better than CMC. But why such a long name? Go for something shorter - that's more catchy and better for marketing.

@_date: 2017-11-19 12:56:00
Looks like it, but that's no problem. You've got LTC as the payment layer and BTC as the storage then and don't even need to hold any LTC cause it'll be done via Atomic Swaps on the LN, whenever you want to pay with your BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:30:43
That's how it works. A lightning channel only has a certain amount in it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:00:20
Maybe they will some day, but I wouldn't bet on it. Have you seen any exchange granting the OMG tokens after the drop on the ETH chain? Exchanges can make huuuge money with not paying out the tokens to the holders. On the other hand it's a lot of work for the exchanges to do this, which they don't get paid for.
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:05:33
I don't think there will be major dips anymore due to fud. But the market can always correct.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:08:24
If you've uploaded your ID correctly then there's nothing you can do but wait. They have a huge influx of new customers so their support probably just takes long. If you don't get response in 1 week from now, I'd write another mail.

Most good technical analysts think 700-850 and then rise again big time unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:46:28
I hope so, cause I'm not planning to invest.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:54:42
Litecoin will still have cheaper transactions on LN, cause you constantly need to open and close LN channels, which will cost on-chain fees. So even with LN activated on btc, it's highly doubtful that it'll be used as the payment layer then. I think it'll be only for large transactions such as cars, houses, settlements etc. and your main store of your wealth.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:04:13
I only use vpns with exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:16:31
Who knows what the real power structures in the world are and who controls what. But I think it's safe to say that this "anonymous hero creating the new money" story is bullshit. I guess we'll see if it was from the NSA if China and Russia won't allow btc as currency in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:09:29
Fork the Apple stock and sell half for Bitcoin Gold.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:51:12
Expect this to be true for all exchanges worldwide very soon with international laws demanding access to all transaction data backdated. It's a stupid idea not to pay taxes when all your transaction data is getting stored together with your id forever, and many people will get heavily burned in the coming years. Legislation will move quickly on this.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:45:55
Put it back to BTC quickly, then watch LTC rise.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:17:10
as low as 13k

@_date: 2018-02-03 21:38:59
Yes, in a perfect society you will have to pay for what you want, else you don't get it. "surely there are very few people who would rather pay taxes than have the money come from elsewhere." - That's the problem. Most people are parasites, they just vote for stuff that serves them while others have to pay. That's why no democracy will ever work, people simply vote more money into their own pockets than can be paid for.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:41:01
And the funniest thing in all this is - I really haven't worked a day in my life :DDD But you keep enjoying your full time job :DDD
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:58:55
So you're saying government is bad because it's a monopoly?
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:18:11
No, that's pretty easy. All bigger wars in recorded history are due to governments and wouldn't have been possible without taxes. And most of them were fought by mindless orks who didn't even know what they were fighting for.
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:17:14
Nope, you're just another dumb ass socialist who couldn't formulate an argument if he had his whole life to do so :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:12:57
I'm not American, but I happily pay for every service I want and use. Just not for the 80% I don't.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:38:53
HAHAHA "i have a full time job and two kids." - that was you literally 12 hours ago in your history. It's all bullshit from you socialists :DDD Your life must be so miserable ahahaha.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:47:32
Nope, Chinese BTC volume is lower today than yesterday and keeps dropping to insignificant levels.
The recent volume is USA + Japan and Korea.
The only coin the Chinese still have some relevant volume in is LTC, but that's dropping by the day, too.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:18:13
Hahaha, the only people who feel the need to tell the world how "good" their life is have a miserable life. Look up "projection" on the internets. You're probably an old grumpy guy who can't deal with his age and is too dumb for any serious conversation. And you're somehow reliant on tax money for yourself. You moronic socialists are so funny :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:44:43
Thanks for showing everyone the level of your arguments again :)
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:46:49
Using it to avoid taxes is.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:36:45
For which country? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:37:36
I'm capable of planning and investing for changes in my circumstances. There's also tons of private insurances for everything. I can also donate to things I find meaningful. Most tax money is used for destructive and parasitic things and we're already having a very bad time as a species because of this.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:07:53
He meant Bitcoin Cash. And I agree, it's almost 390 USD.
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:22:27
Doesn't matter, you're not anonymous either way.
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:48:19
Didn't happen on any exchange i follow. CNBC , Reuters and JPMorgan seem to be of the same clique. They're pushing fud like noone else.
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:53:13
No, but I can tell by your question that you're a leftist and socialist. All your thinking and arguments revolve around social proof :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:59:53
Don't know if you should put your expectations so high man. Triple digit figures are a goal that even professional traders are unlikely to achieve.
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:48:02
I don't think it's going to be a major problem, because there's already quantum-resistant cryptography out there.
The thing is, quantum computing will at first be available to governments and very rich individuals - and I'm not sure how much calculation is needed in that kind of cryptography. So it might cost quite alot in terms of transaction fees, if a regular computer network would try to protect itself against quantum computers during a transition period. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:33:29
Where was it?
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:32:06
Hm, I've thrown some ETH into it. The idea sounds good. If they are quick to add new tokens that you have to get on sucky exchanges like etherdelta they might get some market share.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:22:04
the ones i use from subjective good to bad:
bitfinex &gt; bittrex &gt; gdax &gt; binance &gt; bitstamp &gt; kraken &gt; hitbtc &gt; etherdelta
@_date: 2017-10-10 07:41:13
That's very wrong, and if people trade on exchanges with verified names the history is kept there. Better inform yourselves, who knows how that data is handled in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:57:42
still taxable.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:30:51
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:52:28
Treating BTC in the USA as a commodity would keep ISIS and North Korea from transacting in BTC???
Because they're afraid of having to pay taxes then or what?

@_date: 2017-10-10 09:29:39
Who cares about Russia? Their share is irrelevant.

What exchange(s) do they get their data from?
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:13:24
That's the shittiest of all coins. Can't wait to finally see it burst.
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:15:16
I really wouldn't bet on it going much lower than it's now.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:00:28
By that definition nothing would have an intrinsic value.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:59:21
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:00:52
So a scissor would have no intrinsic value?
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:29:43
Lol. Can you tell the name of the bank?
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:01:57
Sold everything I had at 5150. I'll buy back in at 5600.
@_date: 2017-09-27 08:48:03
You're still in the middle of a dip.
But the China fud is gone now and attempts to talk btc down don't show much of an effect anymore. So I wouldn't wait too long.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:54:39
It's ok. Plus you have to be aware of what can happen in the future. In Germany since beginning of this year our government can install spyware on your pc or phone if they suspect you avoid taxes. The law even allows them to install spyware on someones devices who is just in contact with a person they suspect to avoid taxes. In this case Monero is useless. I'm certain this is/was planned in all Western countries at least. You're lucky you're having Trump right now who seems to be with a different group within the elite.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:31:40
Maybe they've already paid back whatever funds they've used from other people?
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:25:08
I think ~4150 is the lowest it can dip, if no fud happens for any reason, then up.
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:27:53
I wouldn't use Kraken during heavy load times. You can't even place orders there without being sure they went through, if they have the slightest bit of traffic.
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:50:01
"i could make double what i make now, but i have all the time in the world to make money later in life..." - This keeps getting better and better, you're poor as well. HAHAHAH. You're such a moron. Thanks for the laugh loser.
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:59:53
It rises cause it's their own exchange. They can put any value they want on that fucking scamcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:59:06
1. you don't know who the richest people are and how much they have. - 
2. Should the cryptos be wanted as a future currency, you can be sure that they already bought into more than Sat has, or that these people are in fact behind whoever Sat is.
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:46:43
57,34%. This is a reliable number.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:35:06
I would suggest you watch a good youtube video about the fiat money system, how money is made and its consequences. Unfortunately I can't give you any English videos on that topic, but someone else here probably can.
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:26:04
Data from Coinbase doesn't seem to get refreshed, use a chart from a different exchange. All others work fine.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:31:43
You could leave your sealed paper private keys with a notary. And there has been an ICO some time ago exactly for leaving your cryptos to someone, but I forgot the name. Maybe someone else here knows.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:33:43
Agreed, the speed of LTC + limited supply + smart contracts is bigger than people realize at this point.

Yes, right now invest in cheap altcoins.

Been like that for months, and they don't seem particular keen on fixing it. Just use other exchanges.

1,000,000 Satoshis are 0.857 Litecoins = 857 Lites.
Try figuring out the answer from here.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:35:56
Well if they can be so easily printed, how do you guys expect it to stay at max. 21 million coins?
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:22:38
You better do a search on google on taxes, cause trading on Gdax is not anonymous.

Sounds like solid investment advise.

Everyone uses USD as reference here. I think cryptos are securities in the US, right? Then in any case a security is taxable as soon as it get liquidated. Same in every western country. So the ruling concerning holding it for longer than one year would apply, too.

buy eth or btc at kraken with eur, then send to bitfinex or bittrex.

The only way for it to collapse at this point would be government bans on trading or posession from major entities like the US and Korea at once.
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:38:15
Yea, but its like 95% Muslim countries. Wouldn't be suprised if the people affected that come from NL or USA have middle Eastern roots.

I'd leave it on Coinbase. Activate F2A.

IT'S THE EXCHANGES WALLETS. THANK YOU FOR READING.

I have no idea what they will do, but I suspect that the currency coins like BTC, LTC, ZEC and so on might legally fall under that "virtual goods" thing, while some other tokens might be handled as securities. But I don't know, it's just speculation.
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:18:52
I agree. And I expect the day will come where most people won't hold a full Litecoin either, only some Lites.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:44:04
Why do something illegal when you can do it legally?
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:15:31
This "harmony" thing sounds good, but it's toxic. 
Cryptos are about freedom, not centralized thinking. Let everyone do what they want and let the market decide.

So if China comes back, what coins are likely to pump?
If they allow all kinds of tokens probably Neo, Qtum, LTC, if they just allow currencies then LTC - and what else?
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:41:40
Even if you can just invest Friday - *IF* China comes back into the market after their meeting thing you'll still have huge gains in a short time even if it spikes now.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:18:46
That's still 2800 Lites dude.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:32:09
That's extremely wrong. A BTC has an intrinsic value, and that's its encryption.
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:36:20
It's basically affecting people from countries like Syria, Iran, Turkey, India etc. with few exceptions. I suspect it has something to do with US anti terror regulations. Sucks for them I guess, but I'm not concerned until there are people from Western states affected.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:55:49
Now I finally know why BTC appreciated during the last years. Thanks man.
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:04:50
sent you 0.5 btc
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:37:04
I suggest you learn the basics about cryptos first. Watch some videos on youtube.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:29:57
Well, they might take an approach where utility tokens fall under different laws then just plain currency coins. From what I read out of their statements they seem to have a problem with classifying certain tokens as securities, while for others they have this term "virtual goods" or something like that. Who knows what they come up with in the end.
@_date: 2017-10-05 12:18:53
Well, you have to give him credit for his TA though.
The thing is, at this stage and probably for the next 3-5 years, all that really matters for cryptos is fundamentals.
TA is useful to estimate how far a coin probably dips during fud times, but the rest is just rumors and news.

That's nothing. In Germany you already have to pay 42% income tax above USD 60k.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:04:53
Putin already ordered to regulate and license the exchanges and probably mining one day after he made the remarks about potential dangers. Banning BTC is old news from "journalists" who are not capable of researching.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:25:26
Wouldn't wait too long, it'll pump heavily during the next days and weeks.

Anyone with half a brain wants to pay for safety, firemen etc. and invest in a good education of their own children (that excludes public schools).

Not everyone wants socialism. But those who want it should have no problem paying for it themselves.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:14:17
As soon as you exchange one crypto for another it's taxable.
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:17:35
Still taxable though.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:24:47
Yea. If all major countries banned it, the price would drop to USD 10. We're only this high because governments aren't trying to stop it.
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:24:33
You can only sell the news if there are any. But there won't be.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:28:00
He actually told them to regulate and license the exchanges and keep up with the technology.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:45:02
Only on small exchanges. Trading volume on their own exchange is 22 times larger than all others combined. They can do whatever they want with the price.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:02:43
You got the 70% from CNN?
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:07:31
There you have your answer for bitcoin. Its encryption and its properties for transactions are its intrinsic values. That's btc's usefulness.
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:06:17
How could you answer this with another question?

Damn, the bubble will burst once again. I knew it. Was too good to be true I guess.
