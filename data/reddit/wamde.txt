Lightning network maybe?

Yes but the point really is that in case you can't do it, someone else does it for you (eg. if you lose your phone or something).

Right, but that is not user friendly at all especially if the time lock negotiated during channel opening is short. Also, if your node runs on a desktop at your home, DDOSing it for weeks is easy, hence my previous point regarding watch towers.

I think that the idea that launching a DDoS attack is expensive is ill-conceived, to take out a home server or a mobile node at least. And again, the amount of time you would need to do that for depends on the time lock negotiated when opening the channel. 
I think that the use case is not to have someone who dislikes you steal your fund. I am thinking of something like:
- advertise negative fees so that nodes open channels with you, or wait for normal channel creation
- wait for transactions to happen on that channel
- save a state of that channel which is favorable to you
- broadcast it on the blockchain
- at the same time, take out the node you had a channel with to prevent them from challenging your blockchain channel closure 
Maybe the size of the channels and atomic multi path payments will make such attacks economically unsound, but if there are big channels out there and the tx fees are low, I think that it could be lucrative. That is until a robust watch towers service exists.

Maybe, but the security of your funds shouldn't rely on your ISP doing the right thing.

Someone actually read the article. Upvote.

It's successful because it works as intended. Note that this is a use case in the protocol itself, so not really an attack. Nodes being DDOSed and incapable of calling out such an attempt sounds like more of an attack. 
Watch towers will have to be implemented in a reliable, distributed way to fend these off.

Scam alert.

You can also cost average and hedge your bets ��‍♂️
