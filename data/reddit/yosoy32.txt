I'm interested in buying some discounted GoxBTC with BTC from my coinbase account.  I understand the process except for one thing..  I've recently read articles that mention how Gox has recently disabled internal transfers of BTC within Gox (happened ~ 5 days ago).  It was supposed to be temporary for about 6 hrs while they worked on some technical difficulties.  I've searched but have found no mention of Gox resuming internal transfers of BTC.  Does this mean that BitcoinBuilder cannot transfer GoxBTC that is purchased to our Gox accounts?

I just heard back...bitstamp should be back online shortly.  Apparently, the site owner's grandmother was vacuuming and accidentally knocked the server down.  From the looks of it, there isn't any physical drive damage...so all of your account balance information will likely be ok.  Site owner will need to get a new power supply though and has headed off to Best Buy. We should be up and running soon.

The bitcoin market, like other markets is pretty complex.  There is a lot going on at the same time.  While that aspect may be true, their are other reactions that take place as a direct result.  Imagine you planned on selling at a higher price (~$1000) then you see a sudden drop once Mt. Gox reports a price of ~$900...down to $815 and rapidly dropping..  Of course the thought of firing up a quick sell order would cross your mind.  So many people panic sell in reaction to large sell orders that were planned as you say.  The new panic sell orders further bring the price down.  In short, there's no rhyme or reason to any of this.  The coin price could recover and shoot back up to $900 or it could just as easily crash once some multi-millionaire sells tens of thousands of coins causing panic sales in a chain reaction.  
It's gambling :)

I was kidding.  I really hope bitstamp isn't running their operation from the basement of grandma's house.
Just trying to inject a little bit of humor into all of this.

Lol USPS!  Seriously though..it's the performance of the market maker/exchange during times of high volume trading that matter most!  Imagine not being able to log in to cash out and watching your coins plummet for hours...  Mt.Gox all over again
