This is a gray area. Until now sites in other countries have not been targeted. But the law doesn't specifically state what is considered as "doing business in Estonia". Does it apply to serving Estonian customers from outside of Estonia?. I've tried to find out but never got a clear answer, other than, we see from case to case.

The police is seeking information from me, to determine if they can charge me. They've said so much in an e-mail to me and charged another trader for trading 2,000 Euros. In my view this makes it a right to silence situation.
Furthermore I believe in fundamental rights and I believe they are worth fighting for, if we don't, our rights are going to be trampled upon (they already are).

LHV recently hired the cop responsible for starting Estonia's anti-Bitcoin policies... he's a very rigid bureaucrat who applies rules as narrowly as possible. This doesn't bode well considering he's leading their AML department.

I'd say it's unfairly restricted. In the OP I explained the special restrictions they now apply to Bitcoin - some comments even quote the laws where that's written (so you don't have to take my word for it). I didn't use the word "banned", I countered the claim that it's being treated "just like any other economic activity", when it is clearly not.
While my case was about exchanging, the law as I read it suggests that whenever more than 1,000 Euros worth of Bitcoin is "mediated" in a month these restrictions apply. So in theory it should also apply when buying something for bitcoin other than Euros, for instance expensive jewelry.
If in doubt, you can write the appropriate ministry or agency in Estonia and file a request for information (teabnõue in Estonian) and ask them this question. Tell them I sent you ;-)

That's also what I thought until about 2 years ago, unfortunately I acted on that belief and you can see the result today.
The problem in Estonia is that they hype up the e-whatever thing of the moment, but no-one outside of Estonia really knows the country, and with no-one taking them down a notch they get to project this idyllic version of what Estonia is.

Create as many problems as you can while you are a regulator, then get hired to solve them.

I used that fact in court to show that the law is being applied arbitrarily. IMHO laws should either be applied to everyone or to no-one. But apparently that's not an issue in Estonia, police can just apply the law selectively when then feel like it - maybe this creates some "income opportunities" somewhere, who knows?
Nice to hear that about India, I would say that's a good sign. India is a country that could benefit tremendously from Bitcoin, which can greatly facilitate and reduce the costs of remittance. I hope Indian government agencies are wise enough to see the benefits and not blindly focus on the risks as Estonian government agencies do.
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:03:44
Basically the Indian government expresses the usual concerns but doesn't act to try to hamper it, at least not at this time. As time goes by it's going to get more and more difficult to stop Bitcoin, so every day that nothing happens is a good sign.
Thanks for the kind words!
I am continuing the fight that's for sure.

It puts Bitcoin at a disadvantage to the legacy financial services industry. This regulation exists to protect incumbents' business model and state control over people.

Funny that, I am irked that they picked me to make an example off and test the law on (costing me nearly 10k Euro), that they threatened me with 3 years in prison and now deny me my right to not incriminate myself.
I am also upset that I used to love the country and was fooled into believing the Estonian e-hype. I feel cheated and lied to.
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:16:53
I did not trade large amounts. Lots of traders on Localbitcoins traded far more than I ever did and in far larger amounts.
So as far as I can tell, they just picked me, because I didn't hide my identity. They probably just needed 1 or 2 people to set an example and I was the low hanging fruit.

No. I don't go to Estonia for this, I just do everything via my lawyer.

Estonia likes to portray itself as a forward looking "e-country", yet when the first truly disruptive innovation comes along, they do everything they can to stop it. (Besides my case, they also imposed VAT on the whole value of Bitcoin trades and then argued for this policy to be applied EU wide - which thankfully failed.)

I can not take it to the CJEU, you have to be referred by a local court - so the ruling on the status and treatment of Bitcoin, blockchain tokens and assets is final for Estonia.
But I can take it to the ECHR on the count of violating my human rights (in particular the right against self-incrimination), and I will do that.
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:00:12
Until now this law has only been applied to me. Something else I find particularly unfair. Maybe they'll now expand to tackle other people?
What entities exactly it applies to? I tried to find that out and never got a clear answer. From the Supreme Court ruling I gather anyone who sells bitcoins for a higher price than he/she buys them for, so I guess anyone who has a listing on Localbitcoins is now fair game. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 10:27:25
The purpose of restricting trade is to hamper Bitcoin and other blockchain tokens and assets
Also see what Andreas had to say about this:
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:46:24
The way I read it 24 says the police can ask (ok fine), and 6.7 says I cannot use that right to not answer because the risk is "distant" and "hypothetical" (in their words). And as I said, the Appeals court was much more explicit (see below) in denying me this right.
Also I don't know how not answering the request can be construed as if I did not decline to answer.


@_date: 2016-04-13 14:21:08
I try. But my wife is from Estonia so she has family there. My children have their grand parents and some aunts and uncles in Estonia. So I might go in summer with them, depending on how I feel. But yeah, I'd rather stay away and go on vacation somewhere else.
@_date: 2016-04-14 08:49:46


No they haven't. The state's first reflexive reaction to Bitcoin was to try to hamper it as much as possible. Find some people to make an example of and impose VAT on the whole value of a Bitcoin.


Yes it did, the regulation is excessive and also totally over the top for the stated objective (AML). It's clearly regulation aimed at hindering and hampering the development of Bitcoin, it discriminates against Bitcoin and other alternative means of payments vis a vis traditional currencies - all while claiming these things are similar in their function.
In my view these regulations violate EU AML law and other EU principles on several counts. We will be filing a complaint against Estonia at the European Commission - I will publish that when it happens (probably quite soon).
It's also interesting to note that there was no VAT on alternative means of payment until Bitcoin came along and they reinterpreted VAT regulation to the detriment of Bitcoin.

Do you use a bank account in Estonia?

Your website does not mention Estonia, and gives the following address:

As a foreigner who lived in Estonia for 9 years, I'd say Estonian authorities are quite obsessed with control.
Example: The state has direct access to all communication networks by law. It does not need to present a telecom operator with a warrant to tap someone. A law like this would be the NSA's wet dream.
Electronic Communications Act § 113:
"(1) A communications undertaking must grant a surveillance agency or security authority access to the communications network for the conduct of surveillance activities or for the restriction of the right to confidentiality of messages, correspondingly."﻿
There's also the requirement for every company to report each invoice or bill over 1,000 Euros to the tax office separately.
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:03:46
Here's the actual section about the right to silence, that I was referring to:


I also need to point out that I actually declined to answer. If you didn't want to answer the request, the law required that I turn to the court to explain why I didn't want to answer or else I'd get a fine. So I turned to the courts, and this was one of the reasons I advanced for not wanting to answer it.
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:07:48
You don't need to be guilty to use your right of silence, even getting charged doesn't mean you're guilty. Learn a thing or two before making wild statements.
You clearly don't know anything about the claim I made or what I was attempting to do, unfortunately I don't have the time to explain the intricate details to every Reddit commentor. Especially not to people whose main purpose seems to be to have an argument.
Fortunately I don't work for you, so you can use google to search for the story of the other victim yourself. There are even references in the court documents my lawyer filed - I've posted them all.
Also I'll decide myself where I post about my case, thank you very much. I know Estonia much better than you do and what they are sensitive to, and it's not what you suggest.
Estonia is supposed to be a small dynamic country, fixing this stupid law could have been done in the last two years, they've changed other things much faster, they chose not to do anything about this. Now they reap the consequences of their willful inaction.
There is quite a difference between VAT on the whole value of a financial asset or just the service fee. So yeah it was Estonia being extremely unreasonable vs the rest of the EU being reasonable.
I gave specific examples. You are even discussing them, so let's not pretend I didn't give any examples please.
@_date: 2016-04-12 12:51:09
It did not rule that it's a currency, but an alternative method of payment. It ruled that the extra tight regulations that the state wants to impose on Bitcoin can be applied. Regulations that are NOT applied on other currencies.
It's btw interesting that in the VAT case before the ECJ Estonia argued that it was not a currency.
@_date: 2016-04-12 22:35:32
There is this thing called disagreement about the interpretation of the law - and that's tested in courts. So for instance the EU requires that a member state justify any extension of AML law and register that extension with the EC, and it's written black on white as you say. Estonia however failed to do these things, Estonia broke the law, yet the Supreme Court does not hold the state accountable for this failure.
@_date: 2016-04-12 17:25:15
From the website, it doesn't look like paxful trades on its own account, it just points you to other traders (not in Estonia).
@_date: 2016-04-15 11:59:08
You file a tax form in order to determine how much tax you have to pay. The questions I was asked are for the purpose to determine if they can charge me. Totally different purpose. BTW, par 22 doesn't list any exceptions to the privilege against self-incrimination.
No country in the EU has more restrictive rules that apply to Bitcoin, blockchain tokens and assets. Some outside the EU do, but not in the EU. It's a verifiable claim, and if you think it's not true, it's simple you can supply evidence of another EU country with more restrictive rules. I haven't seen anyone do that, most likely because they can't.
@_date: 2016-04-12 11:37:33
That's what I thought until Feb 2014, I was wrong and it was (still is) an expensive mistake.
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:31:10
Actually the court copied the ruling from the Appeals court on this, which was much more explicit that I don't have this right. The Supreme Court did not correct the Appeals Court on this point, simply repeated part of the Appeals court conclusion.
As I explained I declined to answer and was told that if I do not want to answer I have to turn to the courts and argue why. And that I did.
We argued many things, incl. my right to silence, and also that the request was not valid, etc, etc.... these are not mutually exclusive things. Part of the case was to determine which law applies to Bitcoin.
But it's interesting, and I may test your theory, as now I have to answer their request I could write as an answer that I decline to answer.... I'll discuss this with my lawyer tomorrow.
@_date: 2016-04-12 11:30:20
I certainly feel misled by Estonia. Of course they like the government's own technology, they are just not really open towards disruptive innovation from the outside. A kind of "not invented here" syndrome.
@_date: 2016-04-12 12:03:00
The ruling states explicitly that the right does not apply because according to them the risk of self-incrimination is distant and theoretical. You should read the whole ruling.

There are many things I find unfair.
But at this point it doesn't matter, all that matters is that they have irrevocably ruled what Bitcoin is in Estonia. The consequences of that are what I posted (and the law quotes you posted confirm that).
And that means that Estonia is the worst country in the EU for Bitcoin, blockchain tokens and assets.
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:26:34
Maybe he thinks that blockchain is just a datastructure, and doesn't know the importance of rewarding hashing power for the security model to work well?
It's a typical example of the grand statements one always hears in Estonia, and I've heard over the 9 years that I lived there. I've grown quite tired of the Estonian e-hype.

The police is seeking information from me, not to fight terrorism, but to determine if they can charge me. They've said so much and charged another trader for trading 2,000 Euros. This is a basic right to silence situation, I do not have to testify against myself, it even says so in the Estonian constitution. In paragraph 22 I believe. The constitution does not list any exception to the rule.
It's probably the best thing to complain on Reddit. This is exactly the kind of publicity that can get the government of Estonia to change it's attitude.
Two years ago when this started I was one of the founding members of the Estonian Cryptocurrency Foundation. The head of the foundation spent countless hours lobbying for a change in the law.
The Estonian government has done nothing in all that time, they chose to let it come this ruling by the Supreme Court, in other words they chose to let this bad publicity happen by doing nothing for more than 2 years.
I'll also note that over these 2 years, Estonia (alone) argued strongly to the ECJ to impose VAT on the entire value of a Bitcoin trade - the other two countries argued for VAT on the service fee only. Had Estonia gotten it's way Bitcoin would have been severely hampered in the entire EU. Thankfully the ECJ is not a rubber stamp court for the Estonian government and it ruled against the position of Estonia.
The Estonian state has over the last two years systematically done everything it could to hamper Bitcoin, and by extension blockchain tokens and assets.
The only thing that can change things now, is a bit of bad publicity for the government.
@_date: 2016-04-12 15:20:08


The Supreme Court just confirmed extremely rigid laws that apply to everyone, and you call it an "isolated case", or is Estonia the kind of country where the law is applied selectively?

Yes, this means it's going to take another year or two.

Estonia is as anti-Bitcoin as you can get in a democratic country. It was the only EU country to impose VAT on the full amount of Bitcoin sales, and it is the only EU country with extremely rigid rules on trading Bitcoin. In order to hamper the trade of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, customers must be met in person (face to face) for identification (of course they claim this is for KYC purposes, but the same is not required for fiat currencies).

Some years ago I was attacked by a person wielding two knives. There was even a witness. I filed a complaint with the police. The attacker claimed that he was in his kitchen and had forgotten to put the knives down when he went outside.
The Estonian police actually bought this crap and said there was not enough evidence. Strange as the guy admitted having two knives in his hands and a witness saw that he threatened me with them.
I guess that for the Estonian police trading Bitcoins is a big crime while threatening to kill someone is not important at all.

In the end the prosecutor dropped the charges against him.
His "crime" was trading Bitcoins without a license, and violating Estonian AML law that requires meeting customers in person.
In my case I had my own website while he used localbitcoins (I think), even though our trades are in the same order of magnitude and we both did bank transfers.
I think that it is an attempt by the police to criminalize the exchange of cryptocurrency between private individuals. They are testing the law trying to see how far they can push it and how much they can restrict our freedom.
Europe consists of many countries, Estonia is the former Soviet Union, the state's behavior, and that of its agents, doesn't magically change by removing a label - it requires a cultural change.
I would not expect anything like this to happen in countries like the Netherlands for example, in fact I am pretty sure that it doesn't, since lots of people in the Netherlands have done the same and were never harassed. So I moved the Netherlands, and opened a similar site there, I still have not been harassed by the Dutch government and probably never will - which shows the difference well enough I think.
@_date: 2016-03-02 22:48:13
Yes and no. The legality issue is about how heavily restricted bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in Estonia (not a binary legal/illegal question).
With the state's current restrictive interpretation, Bitcoins are as legal in Estonia as blogging is in Russia (i.e. so heavily restricted that you'd better do it somewhere else).
@_date: 2016-03-02 22:42:24
The other guy, who wants to remain anonymous (but I do know him), was indeed charged for 2 trades worth around 2000 Euros.
I (owner of btc.ee) was not charged, because they had no information on my trades.
Instead they are trying to compel me to give them information about my trades, but since they charged the other guy for what is really a small amount, I am not exactly inclined to want to give them any information.
So I sued the police to have their warrant nullified and the case is currently at the Estonian Supreme Court. If I lose I will go to the European Court of Human Rights.
My trades, were also tiny (I can't publish the exact details, because I don't want to give the police any exact information), but I can say that the total of my trades in 1 year were below the EU AML reporting limit of a single transaction (i.e. less than 15,000 in one year).
There was some modest KYC in place, I identified people through bank transactions and secondly the maximum transaction was 500 Euros well below KYC limits.
My guess is that Estonia wanted (and still wants) to discourage the use of cryptocurrencies and picked two random people to make an example of (Soviet habits die hard).
All the laws they are trying to apply are still on the books, and Estonian agencies have expressed strong support for the restrictive interpretation of the laws, in their filings to the Supreme Court this January.
Most of the documentation is available on btc.ee, unfortunately a lot of the official documents are in Estonian, but all my commentary is in English.
