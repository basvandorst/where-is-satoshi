how long you think it'll be before we see 20k again?
that was pure speculation bursting

on the fear of putting my foot in my mouth I bet we don't see a stable 20k at all
I bet we see a bit more dropping 6-8k until we see a stable back around 10k for a few months before the roller-coaster starts again
our own little mini boom and bust cycle based purely on speculation and our lack of short term memory
I can't wait to see when the automated bots start trading BTC and someone fucks it up and we get one of those recursive loops because there's no freezing like with the stock market...
can you imagine the shit fest of the whole thing bottoming out? but enough would have to be owned by the few to see it, so it won't be for a while

Fair enough and it would not have been the first time someone has done something out of stupidity instead of malice

The IMF controls the monetary policy on all these countries one way or another. The IMF is not a federal institution but private. It has controllers.

you assume this outcome wasn't the intent
physical assets are much more desirable then fiat currency that can be made to go up and down at will
better yet if the private banks can get, say Germany to foot the bill for their private acquisitions
so Greece cant pay everyone and 90% get shafted, the 10% steering this just got physical returns in Greece 
think factory store on a larger scale

That just reinforces my point, which isn't just mine, there is much better proof in the tread. Ask yourself why the EU wants Greece to take on more loans instead of restructuring the debt they already have to something Greece can actually pay.
