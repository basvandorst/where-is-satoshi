Unfortunately, it seems to me that although the global markets are unraveling and the conditions have been dire in places such as Greece and Venezuela, for some reason people arent utilizing plan B(itcoin).

Well said, that's how I feel as well. Just happen to be bearish looking into the next 6 months.

THANKS EVERYONE WHO POSTED
Good opinions given here. Altered my perspective on the halvening.

What I'm saying here is.... I think the post-halvening demand has already been supplied.

My rationale is citing the lack of exuberance and tangible progress/innovation/developers on this particular chain. I've been here (not here,here) since 13' and the air just feels stale at this point. I've been a bag holder for quite some time, and I'm not sure bitcoin relies on a high price. We could ultimately see a succesful BTC operating at around $100 coin for a period of time and there's nothing wrong with that. I'm just not convinced, given the surrounding issues on this chain that cutting the block reward in half is necessarily 'bullish' right now. ( yea,yea, supply/demand)

Those markets have not been rational in years, that shits manipulated and rigged. There are big banks paying Billions in fines for that very reason. Shits bunk.

True, thanks for your insight. I hope you're right. With that logic we would hope for a snowball effect hinged on a increase beginning with pumping in 1$ mil a day?

I don't mean to belittle blockchain.info's 'Thunder' settlement network, but it's not sexy or exciting to me. Do you have a reason why it is?

HODL, pop bottles. I hear you player.

Well said, dude. "needs to play out" I agree. But don't want to gamble my nut and the well being of my future family on this scenario.
@_date: 2016-05-19 14:46:30
Haha dude! that's part of the reason were all here in the first place.

You're giving me some food for thought, nice post fella.
