Harborly has two tiers of verification, both of which take under 3 minutes (even for our most robust KYC requirement), and our main payment method hooks directly into your bank account for buying and selling. I'm also excited to announce that we will soon have full support for Interac, wire transfers and credit cards!
Here's a guide from our site that explains it in more detail:

Harborly initially started out as a purely Litecoin service, but we have expanded to product to include Bitcoin too!

We have spent that last months in Canada running our beta, building out the Harborly platform and working closely with our users. And while we've been doing that we have also been working with banking partners to launch operations in multiple regions over the course of 2015.
To give you a better sense, our key targets for the near future include Europe, Latin America, the United States and India.
