That's a good article. Thank you.

Thank you. I think you answered a good bit of my question. 
So what is needed to get China or other nations to accept Bitcoin? I saw Denmark and Finland announce that Bitcoin is not currency in their country.
Edited: spelling.

Thanks again!
I see China only banned financial institutions from dealing with Bitcoins. So in theory citizens can still purchase and convert them elsewhere. What's to stop that?
Is Bitcoin truly untraceable? For money laundering and or terrorist activities can't the exchanges just report suspicious activities? Since governments can't regulate the currency at least they can regulate the business that use them. I see New York plans to do that already.
With money equals power thing, if people start moving mass amounts of money to Bitcoin, banks would start to lose their power. Right?

As I read more and more I understand that. I think Bitcoin has it's place, but what will happen if no government accepts Bitcoin as a currency?

I was thinking in order for Bitcoin to gain ground again with the public opinion and become adopted as a commonly used currency, the exchanges need to adopt some kind of solution to the theft of Bitcoins.
Edit: using Swype

Can you enlighten me?

Thank you for the reply and the link.
I have another question. Can there be something to back the Bitcoin like the federal reserve? 
Let's say people who produce Bitcoin use it to purchase gold. So essentially Bitcoin can go off the price of gold and the demand of the coin. 
Sorry, I'm not an economist and I don't understand much about how governments regulate money.

Hahaha. Thank you for your reply!

Thank you. I think all my questions are answered now.

So how do you spread the use and adoption of Bitcoin when governments forbid financial institutions with dealing with it?
