I am going long, but there’s money to be made both ways. Traders take an active role in their profits where as hodlers take the passive income route.
Most people are not great traders and will miss out on money by not simply hodling; however, if you are a good trader and can recognize the best times to enter and exit, you will make money on the volatility. 
Futures entering a market is not a magic wand causing price to sky rocket. It’s the emotional component of normal people buying and selling based on news and feeling.

Good company, sounds business, with Tesla building storage grids over there, it’s a done deal. Smart buy, imo.

Same here!

That’s a lot of speculation. Even more than normal crypto speculation. Not saying you’re wrong or right, since the future is mostly unknowable, but I will say that the more SPECIFIC ideas you have, the more unlikely the guess to be true.

It’s alright man. Shit sucks sometimes. Life’s full of things that are awesome and shitty. Part of the emotional roller coaster through being optimistic and being let down and then lifted up again is part of the ride, should you choose to see it that way.
I’m deeply sorry this has not been a good experience for you, but please try to focus on solutions rather than what’s broken, so we can make our future selves proud of our choices and actions.
Bitcoin can be a great thing, you just have to stare issues in  the face and decide to be the person who fixes or provides constructive feedback to those who will.
I’d like to believe that deep down, this is the spirit of Bitcoin. Community coming together to get rid of bad or corrupt systems and try our best to put in place a more equitable and accepting one. As humanity hopefully has tried to do since the enlargement of our Neo Cortex.
Thank you for your time.

Same, and my life hasn’t really even changed. I just understand the technology now and have finally made some investments. 
For you super early adopters, please spare some coin my future overlords. :P

Haha I have a similar screen shot. That dip last night was fun. Couldn’t go to sleep. ��

I don’t know how much you know, but if you’re seriously interested in blockchain I would also take a look at the other cryptos that are doing neat things to invest in. Find something that resonates with you and hold on

That’s where I got it from and then got the bitcoin logo slapped on. Both the artist can have all of what we make for all I care, they deserve it!

Coinbase is a good wallet, if you want more security you can actually install a wallet on your PC or even buy a physical crypto wallet.  But Coinbase is what I recommend to new or casual users.
I don’t think you can go wrong with any of those 3 long term. I like ETH and Litecoin for 2018 gains, probably ETH. and bitcoin always.

Make a 100 at Christmas or something, buy BTC, hold until 23 at least.

Start with being the reason people have faith in other people. After that it all just falls  into place.

Can’t blame them. Probably getting lit up right now.

Man, it’s still nice to see people answer this way.

We have definitely reached the point where technology is magic and any effort to explain it falls on deaf, uncaring ears. 
It’s not anybody’s fault, after all, who can be an expert on EVERYTHING. 
Still, the media sure does suck at representing cryptos appropriately. There is a MINIMUM amount of education that should be present in every article until the reader base has sufficient understanding of the technology to at least have a good idea of what’s true and what’s not.

It’s all just logical conclusions.  Bitcoin is a runaway train at the speed of light. Governments and banks can’t catch it themselves. They’ll be forced to grab and hold on like the rest of us. This is a case where he market MUST adapt to us.
