Because up to this point, you were probably one of these smug assholes that thought that they were going to be trillionaires for doing nothing.
Turns out that a speculative investment with astronomical returns WAS too good to be true.

So where are the stolen bitcoins?

Why are you getting pissed that you are trying to do something illegal and then got a visit from the cops?
If anything, she should be pissed at you for placing her in jeopardy by your own retardation.

Pretty sure people were calling bitcoin a bubble before it popped. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:12:48
What are the fundamentals of bitcoin?
A wildly unstable currency that can't be used for most things, and wouldn't be used anyway since the value fluctuates so much?
If bitcoin can jump from 10000 to 19000 to 6000USD, it doesn't bode well as an alternative currency.

Why would bitcoin be worth 5K?
The current volatility makes it unsuitable as currency, and the amount of people who actually need digital currency vs the people who were only looking at it as a way to get more FIAT is miniscule.

What most people are laughing at is the throngs of Bitcoiners who think that they are the smart people, and not the ones having their money liberated.

Let this post on 4/3/13 be a monument to your greed. After the bubble has fully inflated, and fully popped, you will be left having made a terrible financial decision that will profoundly effect your life, and will have missed an opportunity that you will never have again.
Remember this day that you had the opportunity to retire the entirety of your student debt and chose not to, blinded by the bubble.

The safety net is to catch people that are falling or have fallen, not provide a hammock (however spartan) for people that don't want to be productive.
If you CAN'T work, then yes, society should step in and provide your sustenance/shelter. If you WON'T work, society owes you nothing. I don't hate the safety net, I hate a system that lets people shirk the basic responsibility of supporting themselves (or even honestly attempting to).
The truth is, these guys need to figure out how to live, and that doesn't include sitting in a park all day playing video games or watching youtube videos for bit-cents.
These guys are clearly technologically capable, and given that they have fucking cellphones and laptops, they have better access to the job market than many people.
Finally, it isn't very useful to offer excuses because it really doesn't matter. These guys clearly don't apply their efforts towards being productive, and the govt. assistance they get alleviates much of the pressure to do so. See how long they sit around the park playing video games when they don't have free meals and have an empty stomach.

You know whats better than feeling that way for a day? Cashing out your fucking bitcoins and collecting those gains.
@_date: 2013-09-20 16:18:33
Even if we discount the volatility of bitcoins (which would also counter the point about inflation), you still haven't addressed the most obvious flaw.
Where are you going to use bitcoins? Are you going to order things online with no delivery address? Are you going to go into 7/11 for a pack of smokes and a chili-dog and pay with bitcoins?
Ask the homeless what they think about a currency that isn't universally accepted, and requires an internet connection to use. Hell, ask them if they've even heard of Bitcoins. Then give em a buck or two and apologize for wasting their time.

I saw this article on Digg this morning and it left me burning.
These guys are pieces of shit, end of story. Taking foodstamps, only having the drive to scrape together a few bit-cents at a time.
Seriously, fuck those guys.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:13:33
Enjoy the bubble. If you can get out before it crashes, you will have done very well for yourself.
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:38:42
I begrudge them foodstamps and any other govt. assistance. If you want to subsist on watching YouTube videos for bit-cents, you can do it on your own fucking dime.
I despise them for the fact that they clearly COULD work, clearly SHOULD work, and clearly DON'T work; all while collecting govt. funds forcibly collected from people that do work.

I'm saying that supporting yourself is the basic foundation by which all things function. If you are an animal, you hunt or graze for food. If you were an early human, you hunted game or gathered edible food, and built shelter. Later, we improved to raising crops or livestock. As civilization advanced we specialized and no longer focused all of our effort on subsistence, but the principle remained the same; people figuring out how to provide for their own needs. For most people in the present day it takes the form of doing a job in exchange for monetary compensation.
Now we come to these guys. Their plan seems to be to watch YouTube videos, and do an occasional odd job. Since this is a shitty plan it doesn't provide them with everything needed for survival. Where we obviously disagree is in the response to their shortfall. Some people believe that society should step in and provide their needs. I'm not sure I agree.
I think in the case that people CAN'T cover their own basic needs (disability) society is obligated to help them. In the case that people DON'T/WON't cover their own basic needs society is not obligated to provide for those needs. Its clear from the article that the men in question could work (no obvious physical disabilities, clearly technically skilled) but do not. 
Offering excuses for why they can't provide for their own needs isn't useful because ultimately, it would be silly to expect that we have a plan/answer for how everyone should live (freedom is deciding that for yourself). That doesn't mean that a satisfactory answer is to bum wifi in the park, live off foodstamps, and watch Youtube videos for pennies.

Umm no. Bitcoins are terrible for the poor because they aren't widely accepted, require computer/internet access to function, and the value of Bitcoins fluctuates too much to be a safe store of value (6 month high/low of $266 &amp; $50, 2 month high/low of $150 and $50).
