tether news is old 
from 3 days ago
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:57:55
that is smart. broadcast a vulnerability to public so that the hackers will be able to implement it 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:44:25
bitcoin is worth $160 billion. tether only $2 billion 
the number of tethers has doubled since bitcoin's peak in dec 2017, which refutes the argument that tether is propping up bitcoin
tether a drop in the bucket here 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:30:40
so a 50% gain more probable than a 10% drop
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:07:42
no it's dick cheney lol 
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:17:58
they call it shitbase for a reason 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:10:01
I don't know what the big deal about bitcoin futures is. they will be thinly traded and only available to a few funds. Noting abnormal will happen 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:10:56
bitcoin has been down for the past 2 days
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:04
two words: fuck coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:05
you can technically mine bitcoin on a 486. will you make anything? no 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:09:01
no. you will make nothing 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:32
coinbase has long delays for everything and high fees. they profit from these delays at customer  expense . rotten company 
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:39:26
but TrueCrypt is discontinued according to the website 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:51:30
if it hasn't been debited already, empty your bank account and it will bounce. but you can kiss your coinbase account goodbye though 
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:11:41
You cannot compare 10% returns from an index fund to bitcoin return. way more volatility and risk with bitcoin. table scraps compared to the 2009-2013 returns 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:35:04
yeah but it was much smaller back then. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:23:22
no big buyers left  . just whales dumping and small-time dip buyers . really ugly situation, tbh. I dunno how low this has to go before confirmation times slow due to mining issues.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:25:01
spammer this guy is posting this spam everywhere.  [
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:24:50
and its gone 
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:08:16
but a ton of volatility and risk to get that 300% . if you just plot the log returns of bitcoin one easily sees that the bulk of the gains were made from 2009 to 2013. table scraps compared to the 2009-2013 returns . that's my point. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:41:20
ill be happy to buy some at 30 , 150, and maybe 300. and then maybe in 15 years we'll get back to 15k again and i'll make a  nice profit. everyone acts like $30 bitcoin will never happen again. it could. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:00:42
Had you bought bitcoin at the peak in 2013 you would now only be up 300% after 5 years, which is not that impressive relative to earlier bitcoin rallies and comparable to returns of individual stocks. 2009- (early) 2013 was when all the easy money was made. now we're fighting for the table scraps
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:26:55
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:06:09
that is the worst period over an 5 year period of bitcoin's history.  there is a ton of volatility and risk to get that 300% . you have to not lose your private key and or get hacked in those 5 years. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:15:16
yea like 5 whole bitcoins 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:32:25
it can be opened as a txt file
 
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:06:57
how would the private keys work? Or is like bitcoin futures
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:37:42
You would need all the old exchange tick data to show bitfinix were the first to initiate these large buys 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:31:56
open it as a txt file 
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:26:39
sentiment already over  
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:50:35
How is that possible if it only fell 20% unless you are using leverage. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:34:26
the private key would be in there 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:28:33
too bad there are a ton of Asian exchanges that do bigger volume than gdax 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:11:40
this is going sub 7600 again 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:23:30
  trading bitcoin on margin? foolish
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:41:30
1  bitcoin is 50% less than it was a month ago, so don't feel too bad.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:02:46
odds are it will drop big again 
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:02:26
there will likely be plenty of red soon 
dont buy now. wait until sunday nightmonday morning.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:42:41
support levels are meaningless 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:52:06
C'mon bitcoin. let's go 
@_date: 2018-12-08 12:19:19
 arrogant comment. given that it is down 85%, most people are in the "buy high" crowd 
@_date: 2018-12-08 08:59:54
i dunno why or how so many ppl are still optimistic. the chart is terrible. no meaningful bounce despite the price being down 85%. Bitcoin is now only 200% higher than its 2013 peak. this makes it by far the worst 5-year interval of performance in bitcoin's history. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 16:19:43
amazing how quickly the price falls when hit resistance 3400
