Sorry for your loss. This exact scenario is why cryptocurrencies are not yet ready for mainstream adoption. It is too easy for someone to lose their money via phishing or send errors.

Not apples to apples. Stocks are investment vehicles, not currency for transactions.

I think we’re making the same point. As it stands it’s more attractive to hold crypto as an investment vehicle, such as a stock, but I think proving the use case is essential for the next level of adoption.

Yes, but the process of recording every transaction is very cumbersome. I have doubts the average normie beyond us nerds would take the time or bother to try, and revert to traditional transaction methods.

I would say $7-9k range is reasonable. We're heading towards oversold, though not there yet.

At the end of 2013 BTC went from a peak of about 1000 to a trough of about 215 on January 2015, representing a 1 year bear market and a drawdown of ~78.5%. The volatility in cryptocurrencies is to be expected for such a new asset class.

That’s a good point.
I think the use case is essential for widespread public adoption, but I haven’t found a clear explanation as to why this would happen.

Agreed! The use case is essential for long-term cryptocurrency growth and survival.
