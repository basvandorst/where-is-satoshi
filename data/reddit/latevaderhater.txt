Credibility lost, I agree.

Bitcoin IS the digital gold. Bch is an altcoin. Fact; there are Much faster and cheaper altcoins than bch out there.

Thank you Santa.

Hard to take any information serious from someone with "impeach45" in their name.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:27
These bch tools are being played. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. And why the heck would I use bch when other altcoins are better in every aspect. 
Bch= price manipulation

Bitcoin is my best friend.
Bcash is my unwanted friend.

Where I live we have Bitcoin atm's. Just walk up, stick your cash in, scan your wallet and walk away.
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:08:57
Read up and coin up son.

Check out coinsquare.io 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:25:00
There are fees everywhere. 
We have bitcoin atm's all over Canada. Just google locations.
My favorite Canadian exchange is coinsquare.io 
Very simple to use, fees are fairly low and they have a great team. The Btc price is abit higher then what coinmarketcap says but hey, it is what it is.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:28:02
The fees are abit high. It's the cost you have to pay for some quick btc with fiat in hand.

When I see red, I invest.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:40:20
I've tried telling my friends about so I'd have actual people to talk crypto, none of them seemed interested. Back to reddit for me. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:34:55
As far as Canadian exchanges Coinsquare and quadrigacx seem to have similar price. 
I dont know much about preev or why they're a few 100 lower.

The great thing about cryptocurrencies is regular people Can be traders. Don't be a hater. These *pretend* traders are making all of us rich. Get off your high horse.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:04:52
That was an amazing response. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:11:33
Lol true.
@_date: 2019-08-12 16:10:28
I have many btc regrets.
@_date: 2018-06-09 00:22:42
I like your enthusiasm. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:58:28
Favorite part is Ethereum watching in disbelief.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:55:41
If im paying for my electricity, I could do what I want with it. I want to mine!

Who knows if this is real but if it is. The problem your grandmother has is YOU.
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:26:05
2 months feels like 2 years in crypto time.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:36:13
At least there's some action. F this stable coin sh1t.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:43:38
Stfu with your fake news.

Lets get rdy for the next fork!

Welcome to crypto! Work out your hands, weak hands tend to drop goods.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:05:30
I'd say stay with legacy, for now. See how things play out in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:56:38
Don't buy at an all time high. Buy the dips.

Nice vid, but I have a feeling btc cash is going to be worthless and btc will prevail.
