Not true sir. My friend holds only 1 BTC which he bought it in 2015 and is just sitting on it. Airdrops not withstanding. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:37:14
no worries

thanks for participating
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:05:35
yes, but 34% are also older than 31 and about 50% of investors earn over 40K, so it's not that bad
One question I should have asked was how much money you have invested in crypto
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:32:04
yes. I'm writing a paper on cryptocurrency demographics and needed some hard statistics. I also find these results very interesting.
I will continue to post this survey for a week or thereabouts

I still need more people to participate in the cryptocurrency survey
please take a few minutes to fill out (completely anonymous)

good to hear that you get something from the results
Early adoption is an interesting one, because if we apply our perspective glasses, I think still within the next couple of years to 2020, everything before will be seen as early adoption
i always find it amusing when people ask about price and if it's too late to invest in a certain crypto. In 10 years time when crypto goes mainstream, they can look back and laugh at their lack of foresight

what's everyone's opinion regarding greenaddress wallet? Is it secure? Any hacks? 
I know everyone will say buy trezor etc hardware key, but....i'd rather not lose it if you know what i mean. 
So Greenaddress wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:33:35
but why? for the sake of a few hundred dollars? why not help the price of Btc go higher still and then take a profit
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:45:13
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:00:08
not at all
if anything, people might sell their DOW stocks and buy into crypto, but that should push the crypto market up, not down

pure market manipulation by people/whales/institutions with deep pockets trying to achieve their own financial agenda

there;s nothing happening on ETC. The only reason people are buying into it is because of the low price and the name. 
List to me the projects using ETC?
