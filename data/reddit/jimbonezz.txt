No need or interest. Just want to confirm we don't need permission to build an app per my own information.
Thanks for all the responses!

Thanks. Being completely new to economic models, I think I'm stepping on some kind of landmine today. You got and recommended sources to sift through the different points of view? eg someone mentioned the Bitcoin Standard.

It has to be ruled a currency by CFTC to really do it right, if I'm understanding correctly. These dollar limits seem like they would turn into a tax and accounting nightmare.
I have been saying the same thing as you all year by the way on this topic: If you spend BTC for a coffee you pay 40% tax on top of the coffee cost, if you're otherwise in the max gains category which was easy to do last year. 
We need it to be currency not commodity otherwise we need to realize that we are indeed luckier than 99% who down own this precious asset. One we get to hyperbitcoinization, you will still be rich even after dumping 40% for whatever you spent/traded. That, or go to jail or get hounded for years.

Good question.

Thanks! What did you mean by production above? What is production in this case?
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:34:14
Yeah but Americans are fat dumb and happy do we really want that
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:00:09
@_date: 2018-09-02 22:42:25
Thanks. So then what's the point? And where is all of this going?
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:09:58
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:38:18
That's where I'm going with this. How would this be fixed with Bitcoin, or is it simply a SoV and medium of wealth transfer, and that's it?
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:09:08
I think I can see what you mean now. What are we looking at here? Fundamentals of two different economic schools of thought?
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:19:21
But why buy a Toyota for 3 BTC today when there's a decent chance you could buy one for 1 BTC a month from now (for example)?
How is price stability established when everything is paid for via a deflationary asset (let's just say one coin to rule them all in this example)?
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:09:47
Very cool thanks for the response
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:42:02
Good points. What about multiple deflationary currencies, though? And regulators can choose which ones, eg BTC + LTC for starters.

Actually, I'm one of the only people I've seen post knowingly about the ICE strategy. I get the premise, I just think that little blurb attempting to connect the recent dip to this story. It has nothing to do with it and if anything this is bullish news for BTC and has been the entire time. BCH is a solid hedge to hold as they are going in opposite but equally important directions.

When you have two options, free/cheap and instant payments off chain (probably insured as well), or expensive, slow payments on chain, why would anyone use the latter? I think the goal is to incentivized off chain for maximum visibility into the system because most off chain methods will likely require KYC. 
I don't know about you, but I'm not so sure people are going to want to choose between intrusive KYC or slow, expensive transactions, longer term. 
Wish I could get one of the big hitters like Szabo to weigh in here.

Here's a couple pros/cons to consider with off-chain scaling approach:
1) Pros
\-On-chain scaling only needs to increase when absolutely necessary
\-Reduced energy costs, as well as storage costs; better for the environment
\-Makes it easier for people to run their own non-mining lightweight BTC validator nodes if they desire
\-More regulator friendly; easier to control, better for environment, forced KYC for the most part
2) Cons
\-Generally anything off-chain will probably require more KYC and thus provide less economic freedom if all transactions can be traced (ultimately this seems likely, even with onion routing and other forms of obfuscation)
\-Mining is less incentivized (correct?)
\-You will get centralized, government-backed mining pools/centers that will be responsible for preventing attacks on the core network
\-BTC will be primarily stored by trusted third parties with insurance similar to FDIC in US-held bank accounts today. This is like the Fort Knox model of gold storage. This is technically okay unless some large entity decides to run off with all the money and screw everyone over, although this is not likely.
\-What about trading? BTC is a poor medium of exchange \*with other assets\* if the on-chain scaling is slow and/or expensive.
Any thoughts? Am I generally thinking about all of this correctly?

I'm going to be the voice of dissent on this one
@_date: 2018-11-13 22:20:20
I will watch this later and reserve judgment for now

Sick and tired of people dumping on him. He's not a pedo. The dude is married and trying to change the world for the better and you are probably single and complaining on Reddit. Have you researched these claims? And mind you if anyone was molested it was probably him on the cast of mighty ducks.

This is just pseudo scientific Adam Back material to feed the digital gold narrative imo

5G will have zero effect on Bitcoin.
