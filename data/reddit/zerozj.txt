Great question! BCH was set up so that it could support BTC's level of transactions . Raising block sizes again is a solution but we're a long ways away from that level of usage and maybe we'll need some 2nd layer solutions later on (maybe LN? when its fully developed?) Point is BCH scales better as a platform because it can clear transactions now as is. For people who want to use their currency instead of just holding right now BCH is the better option. The fear of raising block sizes is that if blocks are bigger then nodes will need more (internet) bandwidth to run their nodes and stay on the network. But the counter argument is that with tech improving all the time and internet speeds increasing all the time this is a non-issue. Really both sides are hoping for something that doesn't exist. One side for LN and one for better internet and cheaper storage. But the other difference is that one works NOW and the other works-- but costs a bit more to use.

Segwit adoption hasn't changed all that much and has infact been higher in the past so I'm not sure that's what you should credit for the clearing. Also transaction volume has absolutely dropped I think you should consult other charts.

I had the same issue when I first discovered that site but if you let it load for something like 60 seconds then all the data will pop up. I haven't been able to find another source like it so for now I just put up with the long load time. But if you do wait for the data to load it's actually pretty fun graph to play with!

Really need to clarify this post. The reason Bitcoin Cash supports 0-conf is because the blocks are not full and so ALL transactions will confirm regardless of the fee paid. The lower the fee the longer it can take to confirm but with BCH the transaction always confirms.  0 conf is the only way to accomplish "instant" transactions on the current BTC and BCH infrastructure. However because BTC blocks are full some transactions don't ever confirm and actually bounce back but on BCH the transaction always confirms so this isn't an issue b cause there is full confidence the transaction will clear. Please read up on mempools and unconfirmed transactions. 0 conf is a feature not a flaw of BCH. 
The fact that you can cancel a transaction with BTC and the fact that some transactions never clear open up the gateway for double-spending and therefore 0-conf doesn't with with BTC as it is now.

This isn't an aggressive post. Don't take it there.

That's the beauty of it. BCH just works! And it works in the same way that BTC did before the congestion got so high. With rising fees and and congestion I'm afraid that BTC will tank the entire crpyto market when people finally realize that this digital currency is painfully slow and expensive to use. I'm curious why you think BCH needs further development at the moment anyway? What issues are there I nthe BCH network (other than misinformation) that need a resolution?

Should you really be so concerned by the voice of one individual? Research yourself and then decide which is best. Keep hoping for imaginary tech and you regret this day

I don't get it. Where's the collusion? There's no evidence in that article. We just post random stuff now?
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:47:31
You're ranting which makes you're arguments very uncompelling. Any solutions or suggestions to follow? Or just the rant? What crypto do you think is so far advanced to have left us in the dust?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:51:26
You're really missing the point of the entire crypto currency space if you believe this. Regardless of your affiliation we are not talking about a tide here. This is peoples money and the only reason anyone of us entered this market was to eliminate the inefficiencies of the modern money market. Now BTC is becoming even more inefficient than the fiat currency market. People will find alternatives. Thats why they came to BTC and they'll move on for the same reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:25
The aggression is really unwarranted. I really don't understand the reaction that the network is getting for choosing the cryptocurrency with lower fees and faster confirmation times. Right now bch justworks can you blame the market for wanting to use the currency that works over the one that's currently unusable. That's not to say they won't come back once BTC finally works again.

Coinomi doesnt handle your transaction that's all done by the BTC network itself. The mempool is very full right now (meaning unless you pay a high fee there simply isn't a miners that will add your transaction times a block) this means that your transaction stays in limbo (in the mempool) until it gets picked up by a miner. Or if a miner never picks it up then the balance just goes back to your account. Not sure of the time frame but I think at most 2 weeks? Could be wrong. BTC isn't very good at moving around right now. If you really need to move funds from Coinomi consider converting to BCH first with the built in Shapeshift exchange and then sent that instead. At the moment BCH has the lowest fees so that's your best bet of getting your money moves safely.

You have to remember that not everyone is holding BTC as the money of the future. Some people just want to make peer to peer payments right now and you have to admit that it's not very practical to use BTC at this time. I use BCH right now for most txs because it has the lowest fees but who knows in the future when BTC is more functional I'll come right back haha. It's not really about picking sides but more about what people can get more utility out of at this moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:45:47
YES! Someone who gets it! Everyone is usually so defensive haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:00:14
To the best of my knowledge there's no way to accelerate. If it doesn't confirm then the transaction will simply be cleared from the mempool and the balance will return to your wallet (I've heard up to 3 days or two weeks). Best of luck!

Wow this is actually touching. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:52:26
That's just how the system works. Fees are a function of congestion and so because there are so many transactions and blocks are too small to store them all you need to pay high fee to make it worthwhile for a miners to finally confirm your transaction. The actual "amount" you're moving doesn't affect the fee. 
Let me know if that was clear enough :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:28:49
This was bound to happen. BTC is just totally unsustainable right now. It's unprofitable to mine (check out fork.lol) impossible to get a confirmation ( I'm confirm transactions are over 190,000) and fees are over $30. At the moment it's just simply unusable. Therefore people will flock to the currency that just works. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:15:36
Fees buddy fees. Right now BTC's profitability is 44 percent reliant on fees. Even as the price falls the congestion on the network is rising and fees are rising with it as more people transaction try to move their BTC around the profitability goes up because they're making more money and fees than with the price alone.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:18:05
The Fees are a function of network congestion and at this point that is expected and the norm for BTC. Might be worthwhile exploring other coins if you want lower fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:34:07
And when that doesn't decrease fees or congestion will you use bch then? What will convince you?
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:18:01
But then it sounds like you never really fully believed in the vision of Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. I think we should all aspire to be innovators in this space and push for adoption and education even when it isn't convenient. I suppose we just have different views and tolerances (which I totally respect). This market can be very scary at times but I think that I can stay buoyed by my optimism about the market. I think you've already said it but I hope you'll keep what you atleast still have and check back in a few years on!
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:53:37
Hm it's a shame you feel that way but if you were so inclined you'd find that it's a lot easier to use crypto than you think. You've said the equivalent of "I bought a car but it doesn't take me places so it just sits there. I hate this car. It was a waste of money." 
Yeah the car doesn't move because you have to DRIVE the damn thing! You can very easily use a Bitpay card to make purchases with BTC or BCH and there's plenty other services like it. If your intention was to use your Bitcoin then you have to at least make an EFFORT to USE your Bitcoin.
