You have to make a transaction on the main BTC blockchain to fund an account on a specific lightning network - to "open a channel". Then, transactions within that network are very cheap.

Well... I don't disagree. But once you open that channel you can make many transactions within it. So if you're paying 1 or 2 satoshi per transaction, and you use the channel 100 times, you're paying like 2.5c per transaction.

Yeah but what I'm describing, when you make trades over weeks/months based on projects' value and events, isn't really day trading, which relies on bots and quantitative analysis, making very short term trades usually based on market stochasticity, and which I doubt this guy was doing. You don't have to be a pro to find some undervalued project to park your BTC in for a few weeks or a month, and win some extra sats.
Edit: Just to be clear I agree with you that most people should stay away from trying to day trade unless they're willing to invest the significant amount of effort it takes to do it properly, and learn all the maths and programming. I just doubt this guy 3x'd his money by trying to day trade by hand, and probably just got in some good alts cheap and didn't get too greedy when it came time to sell. Most people are capable of that if they're willing to do some reading and not just blindly buy into memes.

Just be careful what you read and believe. There's a strong case to be made that *every* current version of bitcoin (2x, 1mb with segwit, cash) is a scam. There's also a *lot* of shilling, paid and otherwise, for each of them. There's too much money involved on all sides now for people not to try to fuck with the original vision of a peer-to-peer currency.

"Day trading" might not be advisable for most people but it's nonsense that you can't trade your way up just with some good old fundamentals. For example, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that SALT was way undervalued last week, when we know it can be used for $25 worth of services when their platform launches next month, or that dropping down to 400 sats was *too* low for XLM with everything it has going on in the near future.
Making calls like that is never set in stone, of course it's possible that some crazy news comes out that find everything, but it's a far cry from roulette.

Actually they mostly have it held by an exchange...

Yeah totally, I get your point overall. But I think the better comparison for people who buy physical gold is already the crypto-owners who prefer to be in control of their own security. Most people buy (gold or crypto) and leave it on an exchange, some people like to store it themselves.

Yeah except normal people actually give a shit about watching GoT. They could, for example ban exchanges in the EU. Imagine the massive adoption when the only way to get any cryptocurrency is with cash on LBC, except if it's a big amount, the cops are waiting for you instead. Of course I don't think this will happen, but you're crazy if you don't think they could stop people from using it. What's stopping that from happening is IMO that some corporations and wealthy people are interested in using crypto for whatever purposes they might have.

What? Nintento stopped being the "only" console when the PS was better/more in the public mind than the N64. The Wii was somewhat of a recovery for Nintendo.
