7% is maximum premium. Depending on actual amount, we can scale down to 5%, but not lower.
You cannot find such automatic hardware anywhere. If you agree to manually send  cleared funds to us, then handling your order is feasible.
You should understand that a card issuing bank moves client's funds from card account to a clearing center not on same day client makes payment, but within 3 - 5 days. So the hardware you need is practically impossible to find now.

Daily, Weekly and Monthly are "powerful trends". After all the noises on M1, M5, M15, M30, H1 and H4, market follows these powerful  trends.

None. Bitcoin is the God / King of all altcoins.

7% is maximum premium. Depending on order amount we scale down premium to 5% or even lower for volume orders.

Estimate time is December 2018 to hit US$20k again, or earlier. But it won't fall back again! Price will eye US$25k from Jan - Feb 2019.

Yes, you should. Bitcoin is the Mother of all altcoins.

Investing in Bitcoins "now" has more sense than investing in anything else.
Certain speculators have voiced US$1mln price per Bitcoin. Although such value surely won't be seen in next five years (if am not mistaken), but in about 15 to 20 years from now US$500k+ per Bitcoin is a great reality.

They must have invested at the wrong moments.
Now is a good moment to buy and hold Bitcoins. Price will go back to US$20k+.
And in 15 to 20 years from now one Bitcoin shall be valued at no less than US$500k.
