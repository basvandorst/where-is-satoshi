There is no difference between it and a piece of paper, other than it’s accepted as money. Like others have said, there’s nothing to compensate you with other than another bill they can print
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:11:58
Damn that’s awesome! Glad to hear you found value in it. Actually just a tip from a buddy who knows way more than I do about the sector, he’s been all over it for years actually
@_date: 2019-07-05 04:18:22
I do ach right from my checking, no fees. Wire is different
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:25:21
If there's less supply and more demand the price would skyrocket. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:16:26
Why not just deposit right into CBP? You’re adding a whole step for nothing in this example. Only reason to use regular coinbase is if you’re in so much of a hurry you want to pay fees and lock in the current price.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:07:43
Agreed. I’ve got a large stake in crypto and also in small cap gold mining stocks, specifically k92 which has been having a hell of a year with major upside still.
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:56:07
You can just deposit on CBP directly instead of coinbase and then sending
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:14:42
Most of the time there’s a 50/50 chance bitcoin will be lower in 3-5 days- I’d say you’re better off depositing directly into CBP and avoiding those fees.

Making dough and stackin bread. 
@_date: 2019-07-02 02:51:02
Love this, haha
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:04:39
Via donations. Doesn’t make it obvious by just straight up asking. Idk I could be wrong but I’ve just seen a major influx lately in these type of posts from brand new accounts
@_date: 2019-07-05 02:57:26
Yeah but if it goes down $1k you’re super happy. The delay can probably help you from bad fomo buys
@_date: 2019-07-06 19:24:22
These type of scams have been all over here recently. I don’t believe a word of this
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:59:55
So far seems like no one cares
@_date: 2019-11-18 01:14:44
Wtf are you talking about? Based on the past halvenings we won’t break 20k until the end of 2020. What effect are you looking for exactly?
@_date: 2019-11-19 00:11:47
I don’t think so. Currently there’s double the bitcoin created everyday than there will be a year from now. That’s less selling pressure and more scarcity.
We haven’t historically spiked at the halving, but months after because of this.
@_date: 2019-11-30 14:58:35
Dec. 2020 = 32,000
@_date: 2019-11-22 03:03:05
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:44:41
Just deposit directly to coinbase pro...
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:41:11
Yes. Usually changing by like $1000 per day
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:54:29
Almost done with it myself, loving it!
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:49:19
This seems huge!!!
@_date: 2019-08-02 03:43:35
Accurate for many
@_date: 2019-08-19 00:12:15
Just buy what you can afford to lose each week. It’s riskier to just buy in one lump sum, and more stressful if it dropped after.
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:52:07
Reading it now, game changer
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:08:59
Ohhhhhhhh snap
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:04:25
Research what money is and all of the looming issues with our current situation. Bitcoin and gold for me
The bitcoin Standard is one book that stands out for me right now. First like 6 hours don’t even talk about bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:54:10
This is extremely interesting! Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:45:07
True about survivor and the burger lol. I think slowly more people are waking up and paying attention to what’s going on. 
You do make good points that most of the community does chant those things probably with little to no solid understanding of it
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:31:36
I agree. I feel like if you’re buying now it should be for a run in late 2020 up to and after the halving. Can’t stress too much over the day to day fluctuations
@_date: 2019-08-03 20:22:52
Sent you a pm. I’m reading the bitcoin standard rn
@_date: 2019-08-03 19:34:56
Because they think it’s worthless, and a scheme to make money. To sucker other people in to buy something worthless at a higher price than you bought it for. 
Of course it’s because they don’t understand it, as others have said.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:32:07
Agreed with other sentiment.. not selling at 20k. As more accumulate and share similar mindset, supply and demand sets in especially after halving
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:29:30
Damn wouldn’t this be nice lol
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:39:56
Haha, right!
@_date: 2019-12-29 18:33:03
To be honest this seems pretty spot on and likely, at least compared to the last halving
@_date: 2019-12-17 13:15:58
Yes the miners are selling the 12.5 bitcoin that are created every block. Once that’s cut in half, there’s much less selling pressure per day
@_date: 2019-12-06 04:16:34
If you buy 100k worth now, how will you feel if we’re sitting at 3k in March? 
If that doesn’t worry you much, maybe just go all in now. Otherwise do some sort of DCA weekly.
@_date: 2019-12-18 01:16:00
Because they have half as much bitcoin to sell
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:55:33
25-35% dips are quite normal for bitcoin. It’s an insane, 24/7 market
@_date: 2019-12-26 04:22:36
Lol right
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:08:07
I’m with it. Haha
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:05:51
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:20:53
Similar boat as you but not quite as much. It's insane looking back how much I was up and the fact I didn't secure any profits is unreal. I'm down overall now a few grand but I've been buying the last few months to DCA and have moved out of some alts to just cut my loses
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:42:09
I bet some of those people will buy again when it's in a major bull run and every article that's out is saying it's going to $250k a coin and people are dreaming of a 10x return. Things can turn quickly
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:44:52
Buy order went thru coinbase pro at 4050, lets see what happens
@_date: 2018-11-16 13:17:22
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:51:23
I’m buying
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:49:07
Bought some at 5.6k, I've got no problem buying more at 5, 4, or 3k over the next few months if this continues
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:56:42
Bought some with fiat today at 5.6k. Gunna keep a close eye and keep buying a bit each month
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:40:49
Long term mind set. No point to try to time the market with these crazy entries and exits. Not everyone is following it that closely on a weekly basis either. I went 6 months this year without looking at or thinking about crypto once, it was nice
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:22:49
Bought at 5617 lets see what happens
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:42:56
I'm pretty sure they said trading would be suspended because of the hard fork? Could be wrong but I've seen this clearly stated on several exchanges the last few days
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:44:36
Cheers to that. It's hard not to keep an eye but yeah certainly many people are way over invested and way too emotionally attached which is a recipe for disaster. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:09:39
Lol good point
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:12:21
So we shouldn't break 20k until roughly 2021. From now through summer 2020 is basically time to buy if this trend continues
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:29:35
Been buying every week but I bought extra below 9
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:36:24
I’ve had one around there for a bit now. This is a marathon not a sprint. Many expecting a drop down and then slow climb up over next 12 months, so who knows maybe the big drop will never come.
@_date: 2018-12-04 03:27:07
Who the hell knows - I just bought at 3830. The doom and gloom on here is unreal though, soon I will stop coming on here again
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:22:15
Haha. Woohoo. Lets see if we hold and can break up 4.5 or so
