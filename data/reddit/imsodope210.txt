I think it is because even if people know this shit is stupid they don't downvote. Most users only downvote stuff that conflicts with their beliefs, whereas this is just retarded nonsense. So it gets upvoted by conspiritards but most non crazy people just ignore it and move on.
@_date: 2014-12-09 19:36:37
It is embarrassing that this got as many upvotes as it did. This kind of retarded conspiracy theory shit should not be on @_date: 2014-01-31 23:26:31
Im a huge believer in BTC, and by no means a hater (I own a fair amount of BTC). 
That being said this seems like an awful idea.
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:02:27
Fuck you caught me.
@_date: 2015-04-09 02:18:57
Does this in any way compromise coinbase wallet safety?
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:12:50
"don't worry it'll correct down to 100 again it can't possibly stay at $200 for long."
@_date: 2013-05-02 13:02:29
Oh damn. I'm sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:57:46
Reference to another thread
@_date: 2013-05-05 03:48:35
Don't let the greedy downvoters get you down, this is an awesome idea :D
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:24:45
You wanT someone to build all of something for a piece of it?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:34:40
But...but I like it when it says verified...
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:06:14
Is that a joke or are you serious?
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:23:37
Wow that's sooooo interesting and not pretentious.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:26:54
If you're serious I'm down. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:29:36
This.. It's a ducking match made in heaven.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:19:19
Nobody seems to get this
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:15:51
I'm worried that this investing attitude will be harmful to bitcoin In the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:04:32
Fuck your stupid ass laws and constants.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:36:32
Um what?

@_date: 2013-11-09 15:27:50
trillion, what is this a currency for ants? Quadrillion by sunday, I say!
@_date: 2013-05-01 04:18:56
Are you 100% sure this is on the up and up? If so should I be keeping all my coins in coinbase?
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:53:55
Is it worth buying these? Or will the difficulty rise make them unprofitable. Also if i buy now when will it ship?
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:04:09
  bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:01:58
