Just because you sent funds to that address doesn't mean that anyone owns or created the corresponding wallet

We'll see. I think if they were random people this wouldn't work but I have 3 friends so far that have verbally commited, 2 of which have already downloaded a mobile wallet so that's something at least to start

Looks to me like you momentarily may have seen a bad gateway message but then were able to receive the funds and play within about 2 minutes. Apologies for that brief interruption

Sent you a DM trying to figure out what happened

I also was having similar issues and getting a more powerful power supply eliminated the issue (had 2 incidents and now have been tuning for 3 months so issues).
