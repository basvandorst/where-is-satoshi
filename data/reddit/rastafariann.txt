I'm going to buy, the drop is only temporary

I'm right there with you brother.  As soon as I saw the dip under 600, I started buying.

Yep, I completely agree.  CoinBase is a joke.  I will never use them again, and I'm pretty sure I've lost out on my wallet there as well.  They closed my account without explanation and refused to respond to my questions and appeal.  Their customer service is so bad, I wouldn't receive a response for days, even during the work week.  I'm using Circle now and haven't had a problem since I've started, and that just goes to show there are better alternatives out there than a morally bankrupt company such as Cb.  Fuck CoinBase.

Yeah, it's ridiculous that processing takes so long.  This type of business behavior would not be acceptable for any business in person.  That's why I've been so frustrated and annoyed at using BTC, because there doesn't seem to be a company that's reliable.  Almost every trade site I've used doesn't have real-time customer service.  They all use email based customer service and it's hard to get anything accomplished with that method.  Not only that, but I haven't found a single company that I can walk into an office.  While BTC is still at an early stage and hasn't received quite the popularity other currencies have, there should still be a company willing to invest for the long term.  Coinbase and Circle are the two frontrunners, I'd say, and even then, look at the situation we've gotten into by using Cb.  I'm glad to hear your situation is resolved and I'm sure we both learned a lesson from this.  Mine is still tied up in my account and I haven't received a response in weeks.  I'm going to hopefully transfer the remaining funds to a personal wallet and forget Coinbase ever existed.  Why isn't there an easier, better, more efficient option yet??? I think this is one of the only barriers BTC has before it takes off. Also, I agree 100% I hope this is an anomaly and it gets better from here out.  I'll definitely keep you posted brother, and I hope you get it taken care of.

I am in the same position as you.  My money is still tied up in my CoinBase account too.  Their customer service no longer replies to my messages or emails, so I've all but given up.  It's a horrible business practice to do so, and I encourage everyone and anyone else to find an alternative (circle) before they end up in the same position as us.

Yeah, I was like wtf? What's the point in even transferring $5 per day if that's my limit over credit/debit card transfers.  It's been much, much more difficult buying bitcoin than I imagined initially.  I've tried getting verified to increase my limit, to no avail.

Thank you, I think cex.io is going to work out for me, I appreciate your help, friend.
@_date: 2016-07-29 18:30:58
Just let me know where, and I'll be there.

Did you link your bank account or debit/credit card?  I put my debit card information in, and it says it only allows lower limits, and for whatever reason, it's at $5 a day.  I figured that's pointless, so I use cex.io and transfer my funds to my personal wallet.  Cex.io doesn't have a limit as far as I'm concerned.
