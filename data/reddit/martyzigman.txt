Looks like they cancelled the transaction.  I took the advice to turn off the email confirmation.  Sent a new transaction.  After about an hour, the bits arrived.  Then I turned back on email confirmation.  I never heard from my support request.

Yes, I too am having problems.  I was able to initiate the process, then it wanted an email confirmation.  No problem, clicked it through when the email came.  But the transaction still thinks I need an email confirmation.

I too am having issues.  It's now been about 20 hours.  Sent a request to Bitstamp support and have heard nothing.  Will report again after 24 hours to see if it resets.

I laughed with Trace when he told the German bank story. Trace, keep advocating!

I too am having the same challenge with the 64 characters too long hashing issue.  The encrypted wallet was generated in 2013.  Some have suggested that it has to do with an old wallet format.
If I run a getwalletinfo on the bitcoind client (version 12.01), I get a walletversion of 60000.  I don't think the walletversion has changed.

In doing more research, I found what appears to be the solution.  It has to do with wallet.dat key compression.

It's real.  We have been targeting existing NetSuite customers, 16,000 worldwide, to enable Bitcoin in their businesses.
NetSuite has made their software free to Startups, and now we can  suggest to Bitcoin startups they can avoid tools like QuickBooks and properly account for Bitcoin transactions.
