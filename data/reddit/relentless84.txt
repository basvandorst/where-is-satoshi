Those that are panic selling fail to understand that bitcoin is bigger this slight correction. If you knew how btc is changing the world, these dips represent a discount.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:58:39
Bitcoin will be $0 or $100k +, there is no inbetween. I'm betting these growth pains btc is experiencing will be fixed.

The best way to influence is to tell everyone about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:52:43
Bitcoin has only started, invest an amount bars on your knowledge of bitcoin. Study anton antonopolous for a whole day and then decide.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:50:09
Excuse my ignorance but o keep seeing tethers and they are releasing coins. What are the implications? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:38:35
How can you watch btc for a year and not invest? You clearly literally just watched the price. 
Did you not watch any anton antonopolous video, or read about the financial crash. You'd be 9x this year if you really understood bitcoin. You wasted time is the bottom line. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:24:15
There will be lots of buying and increases of a few multiples. Plenty of time to play on house money. The ones that will get burnt are the ones that buy just before the crash. What that means for the people that have bitcoin now there is no reason not to protect your earnings.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:09:43
Read up the history of money and how bad banking is, then you will have new belief in crypto

I will stop thinking in 1.0 and think more about what possible percentage return if a BTC as $1 Million. From this point its 125X or 12,500%

You will pay with lossed gains if you try to time the market. DCA. Save the stress and hassle and buy now. Get on with life.

We DONT need to find utility, the market will speak for itself and currently, bitcoiners and buying for pure speculation and that is bringing in droves of people. Years down the line when you're buying food with 0.00000090 = to $0.90 is when the utility comes. Follow the technology adoption curve.

Go read bitcoin, spend one whole day, study anton antonopolous.

The easiest way to make a purchase is to have faith in the tech.
Faith = Research, understanding of the history of money.
I would love a temporary crash, so I could buy in cheaper. You make your money when you buy low.

This is how you do it, pay yourself first. Once you pay yourself first you are then forced to take care of your loved ones. Doesn't mean you don't care because if you cant take care of yourself, how can you take care of your parents. Once you pay yourself first, you then need to be creative on how to make more money. You will need a side hustle if you have a day job.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:54:41
What I would do if I was in technology. Tech guys are clever and will see btc for what it is.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:59:55
Cant wait for the day it fluctuates 10k a day!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:12


The more you read about bitcoin and its history, the more numb you get to corrections. I experienced the bitcoin cash supposed flippening. i saw bitcoin drop from a high of $7k to $5k and watched bitcoin cash rise rapidly all the way up to $2.8k.
Now I know the history of the bubbles etc it doesn't scare me no more. If and when it crashes, it will be due to some massive whale cashing out. The weak hands will panic and sell but the hardcore will be ready to buy cheap again.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:34:55
who knows what number but what it means is acceptance and the public will feel safer about btc
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:49:30
I watched a video that said that wouldn't happen so easily, the exchanges would fuck people over and it's price difference. Can you imagine coinbase naming bcash as btc with a value of 1300. When real btc is 8000 on another exchange. Would be chaos and confusion, lost money and bad trades. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:33:58
The more I read the more I believe it's possible. Read up when Germany has massive inflation 1 gold mark was 1 trillion paper marks. Look at venuszuela situation. The world's governments print money like there's no tomorrow.
Put your money in the bank and in 1 years time, you'll lose 2% spending power or whatever amount that is.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:21:53
Local bitcoins,  there are big traders there.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:34:57


I agree the number is psychological but the feeling is real for people because they don't know they can buy fractions. It puts them off. I have a friend just like this when I told him when btc was under $5k. Said it was too late, too expensive, told him to buy fractions blah blah blah....
He just text me today about btc being $10k, FOMO will kick in sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:16:04
Cme future will take bitcoin past 10k, will be some time before a crash. More mass adoption needed before the crash.
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:52:59
You've will regret waiting. DCA
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:55:11
Get back in, still tons of life in btc

At least you're alive. You can still  be part of the 0.28% that will ever own a full bitcoin

@_date: 2017-11-17 12:40:46
I remember selling my index funds and stocks, took 11 days to clear and there I was, watching btc grow in value over those 11 days. I will not be using the financial system for a long time.

@_date: 2017-11-16 00:10:52
If you feel you MUST own a full bitcoin then obviously now is the best time but if you want to own fractions of a bitcoin then it doesn't matter when you buy in, the curve is still likely to go up.

Difficult to say but even if new coins are getting circulated, it means at some point they start to dry up. This whole reddit board is full of hodlers
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:10:09
but is it really circulating though?, I know someone that is hodling them, so his stash is not circulating.

Watch the anton antonopolous video on bitcoin scaling. why the right thing to do (bigger blocks) is not always the right thing to do. 
Bch scaling is a short term fix, what happens when you have giga / tera / peta blocks to process every 10 minutes? Only the biggest machinery will be able to handle that ie bitmain and co. Off chain scaling at least tries to level the playing field and reduce decentralisation 
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:16:44
Ive been in crypto since August but this is what I know so far:
MTgox crash, Silk Road, (Probably other forks along the way), Bcash fork, China ICO Ban, BTG Fork, SegWit2x which got cancelled, Bcash war, Segwit2x supposedly back on, Bcash is still there, Bitcoin Futures coming ahead.
I did not experience the Bcash fork but I experienced the Bcash pump and that scared me to hell! So much FUD, then I studied more and now I've picked the side, original BTC.
I literally feel if there was another fork, it would be nothing. BTC is too large to be taken down. The only thing I fear is governments and if they allied together which is unlikely.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:42:06
Bitcoin futures maybe
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:27:28
We'd just by the dip! News will spread that bitcoin has crashed, but then we buy the dip and it starts to recover, CME will then go long and then it hits $10k and those people that said it was too late, then start to pile in. The network effect just increases, there is NO stopping btc 
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:53:32
Where you get the 0.5% from? What measure,  is that wallets to population?
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:27:59
They have purchased and have written it off as marketing expenses! Not that anyone will know about it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:13:40
if there is going to be a crash, it will be due to weak hands but we'll be waiting for a dip, if that comes and mass adoption happens all over again.
The dotcom boom resulted in a crash but few companies surived. Amazon was one of them and BTC will still be there. The smaller alt coins will probably die. If a crash happens, ETC and BTC, LTC  are likely to still be here.

The value of bitcoin goes back to the financial crash. Once you understand how the banking system is fcked up, you will understand why bitcoin is the asnwer to part of the systems money problems. I cant see it ever replacing fiat but as store of value yes. The ONLY thing that can stop btc now is a hack that breaks the code or ALL countries coming together to ban BTC completely. Japan has now recognised btc as legal tender, the SEC approved coinbase as an exchange which are clear signs the gov needs to work with crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:28:10
Its the network effect of bitcoin, everyone wants in, FOMO is real. Bitcoin has a long way to go before it crashes before resuming service etc. I'll start getting worried about crash when 1 in 5 people own some bitcoin by then.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:25:43
Why the need? You've made a great decision investing in bitcoin, what could an advisor tell you apart from investing in an index fund? Talk to an accountant instead. Cash out and buy real estate or some dividend stocks to live off.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:22:15
Don't day trade or trying to time the market. Not worth the stress to gain some btc. Get a side hustle and help someone and get paid. Use that to buy more btc. That will guarantee you increase your btc stash. Trust your work ethic more than your trading ability. Trust me I know, the feeling of bad emotional trades. I came out better overall but I feel my luck has run out so I now hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:01:25
The bar has been raised, it's actually 21 btc
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:28:46
Quantum computing is my fear aswell but we'd all be fcked in the grand scheme of things. Power grids will get hacked, Russia hacking the US etc, crypto will be the least of our worries, still too small.
