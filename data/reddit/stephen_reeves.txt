I wouldn't trust keeping my money with any US regulated company. The US government regularly seizes assets from citizens bank accounts without warrants and expects you to defend yourself without your funds. Keep YOUR money in YOUR wallet and use multisig. Problem solved.

The media is implying you can separate the currency from the blockchain technology. It's the next wave of negative Bitcoin press; a form of divide and conquer. Almost every article I've seen in this format takes a piss on the currency aspect; which is a really nonsensical argument since anyone who understands the technology knows you can't separate the two. 
This would apply to Bitcoin and any type of altcoin.

One of the most underrated aspects of bitcoin is that the money supply is completely transparent; all users on the network have the ability to find the exact amount that are in circulation. This allows you to do valuations that you can do with assets like stocks, but that you can't do with fiat currencies, commodities, etc. How many other currencies do you know that have a market cap?

The media has always been in a coordinated effort to smear Bitcoin; the "Blockchain not Bitcoin" propaganda is just the next phase of the smear. Anyone who understands the technology knows that this is all nonsense.

Depends on your rep. I have dozens of positive reviews and no neutral/negative reports. I now get 35% to 40% on a regular basis.

Just some tips from someone that uses the site fairly often
1.) Buyers have a tiered system based on number of purchases or verifying their identity. Based on the level you can only buy things of a certain price level. Every buyer on the site can purchase something under 50$ regardless of their level, so start off by posting wish lists of less than 50$, you'll be able to capture the buying power of more of the users on the site. 
2.) Gift cards can't be purchased with Amazon Credit, so if you get your gift card purchased it's most likely by someone with a credit card. These transactions get cancelled by administrators and relisted a lot. I'm assuming it's because they're looking out for credit card fraud from buyers. 
3.) The better quality and more numerous your seller rating, the quicker it is to get items purchased and the bigger the discount you can expect. It's much easier for me to get my wish list bought today than it was when I started.

Very true. I should have specified that I'm speaking to newbies. If you're an experienced user with a good reputation the game changes a bit.

I've done over two dozen purchases on purse. Very positive experience. Nothing close to being as complicated as OP has outlined. Then again I've only bought Amazon items (sold Bitcoin) on Purse.

 - Super easy to use Bitcoin sports  betting
 - What cryptsy should have been. Buy altcoins with no account
 - I use it nearly every week. I get 30 to 35% off on the regular for small ticket items.

I think that number shows you why the % discount is so high. The sellers are really few and far between. The higher the spending goes over time the discount will get lower/more competitive. It will actually be a much better site for affiliates spending their amazon money in the future.
