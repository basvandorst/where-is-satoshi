Yeah, I actually have never had a transfer take over 2 hours, I guess I'm lucky in that sense. This exchange has a fixed fee of 0.001 BTC, do you think with that amount the 7.67 is going to get rejected?
I feel like they should have a warning about this at the very least

CEX replied to a ticket literally with one character:

Update: It has been 4 days without me getting the BTC. CEX is unresponsive.

Lol, of course I'm not letting this go. They're trying to ignore all of my emails. Haven't responded in days. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:36:19
I did! A confirmation to the *exact* address I intended it to send to, and have successfully deposited to this address after the fact.

Day 8: Absolutely no reply from CEX, BTC is in the nether.

Thanks man, I have, I have screenshots of just about everything from the withdrawal address to confirmation to even it being on the blockchain for the correct address.

You own the private id, thus you CAN speed up the tx. I authorize you to do so. I am on day 4 without money which I need for trading. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:53:32
Yes. CEX is unresponsive.

CEX has not done its part; it has essentially sent bitcoins into a pool that will *never* be confirmed. That is not proper for an exchange. I have emailed multiple times and received no response. I need the coins to trade. Like I've said multiple times, I will PAY you to speed up the tx. I would do it myself but don't have the private key.

People I've consulted already do show that this would in effect be taking the money. In this case, they threw my BTC into oblivion without doing a simple task which would cause it to go through; they essentially took what is mine. I don't see how this isn't a black and white example? Are you implying the law does not apply to exchanges? Confused by your sardonic statement.

It's neither in my CEX account nor my deposit wallet. Before it showed it as unconfirmed at least.

I'm meeting with a lawyer tomorrow to review legal options, and if they don't respond soon I'm gonna publicize this so that people know. I've documented everything. I don't know why they think they can just ignore this.

Everyone I've spoken to says the transaction will be rejected. I am willing to pay more to expedite it but you don't offer the option, and there was no warning that sending a voluminous transaction would mean it getting rejected. I am now on day 4 of not having my money. This is insane. You only respond here, but not to several support tickets. Your withdrawal method is broken; fix it, and return the money to my cex account or have it go through. How can you expect someone to wait weeks before a transaction either processes or gets rejected?

Yes, yes, and yes. But that was for two hours. I just refreshed several times and it reappeared on blockcypher, with 0/6 confirmations. Will update the post.
