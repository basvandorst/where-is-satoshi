In the US for tax purposes at least cryptos are treated like assets rather than currencies.

You could always do Linux with a windows VM it's pretty usable especially if you use seamless mode. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:09:36
You get to use FOSS most of the time but if you have a few essential applications that only run on windows you dont have to make a huge sacrifice. It also reduces the switching cost if you find/ someone makes a really great linux solution.

Bitfinex issues tether and holds one USD for every USDT

except miners can choose to not include your transaction even if the block isnt full. they can set a min fee they'll mine ( nodes even have a setting to drop any transaction today). just because there's more space in the block does not mean that space is free. miners still have to work to make the block and want to be compensated for it. As block rewards decrease miners will start to drop transactions that dont pay a high enough fee just like they do today, the difference is there wont be a completely arbitrary number in the code to stop them from including as many transactions as they can.

Fun Fact: The Glass–Steagall Act was never actually repealed only 2 of the 4 sections of the Banking Act of 1933 that dealt with the separation of commercial and investment banks were repealed in the Financial Services Modernization Act of 199. The 2 sections that where repealed where the ones baning interlocking boards of derectors between commercial and investment banks, and bans on Commercial / Investment bank holding more that a 30% stake in an Investment / Commercial bank ( called an affiliate).

How about Germany or more recently venazelua? Obviously there won't be a perfect example but that doesn't mean hyperinflation isn't a threat.
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:29:00
The size of an economy doesn't change how the fundamental laws of economics work. Printing money causes inflation. It may not show up for a while but it will come. Right now most dollars are held out side of the US, what would happen if those started to trickle back into the US economy?

That's literally impossible. If the landlord source of income is the tenents rent then the money for the tax is going to come out of the rent. If you try to make the landlords margin 0% there you either going to miss asses the value or destroy the rental market.
@_date: 2017-07-09 18:04:23
and you've just indirectly taxed the poor more (as a % of income)

Except there not valid until segwit activates. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:46:34
Thats not exactly true segwit uses anyone-can-spend transactions which require extra rules to be enforced to make sure the bitcoins go to the intended dress (because it moves all of the witness data outside of the main block). without those rules you just be throwing bitcoins into the air for anyone to snatch them up as quickly as possible. The whole point of the activation threshold is to make sure there's engough hash power on the side of segwit to make sure no can steal the money from the any-one-can-spend transactions.

looks like you discovered the FEDs secret QE strategy. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:43:26
They wont be enforceable as intend, if some tries to UASF segwit without enough support and sends a segwit transaction they run the risk of having there coins stolen.
