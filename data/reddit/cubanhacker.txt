Errata:"Jihan Wu is the proprietor of Antmain"
Nope, the company name is Bitmain 
Antminers are the miner's name, not the company name

Buy the antminer S9, so far has been a great investment f, you should expect to make about anywhere between 21 USD a day to 25 USD a day depending on that you mine between bitcoin (18 today) , nicehash(21 today) , bitcoin cash (25 today) per miner.
Be careful, not having electricity costs implies that maybe someone pays it for you ? They will realize, those units are quite high on the electric  bill

Currently you can make about 350 USD/month if your electricity costs are about 0.12 KW/h. You can use a calculator like:
to get a rough idea of how much you would be making/losing as complexity, bitcoin price or energy costs fluctuate

Bitmain Antminer S9's do not come with an on/off switch.
If you have a regular power supply unit to power the miner their default state is off. The motherboard controls the on/off button for a regular PC. 
Since the Antminer lacks that functionality .... you must setup the Power Supply unit to be on at all times and operate the on/off switch on the back of the Power Supply Unit.
Shorting the pins on the connector sets the Power Supply Unit to always on as if the circuit was closed by the motherboard.

It will not make you rich overnight , but you can pay a car lease with it, prices will continue to go up for sure.

yay ! 
2)have your own local wallet is the safest or a paper wallet
3)to stay "more" anonymous" , yes. but you don't have to
4) get enough , more
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:00:20
more like 13.5 THs,  It should bring a bit more than that, $610, making you $350 a month, the miner is more like $1415 + $150=1510.00 . You make it back in 4-5 months, leaving you the rest of the year and on into the future. 
In my experience, bitcoin price is rising faster than difficulty...so far I've never made less than that, actually more sometimes switching coins to a more profitable SHA-256 coin.

oh wow, why did it got deleted? for accessing it from a terrorist country ? I could set it up there, by transferring to my friends dollars and getting BTC here. However I do not see a lot of market for it....
