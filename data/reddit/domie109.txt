@_date: 2018-05-16 16:12:03

@_date: 2018-05-20 05:44:25
Bank of America has never caused me issues 
@_date: 2018-05-01 10:24:51
HELL to the YA!!
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:44:40
LTC also some good news coming from Twitter 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:23:21
Litecoin has many pros tbh. It's only a matter of time when it will truly take off. Until then I will stay 50/50
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:46:53
LTC will be doing the new easier method in 2 weeks I believe.  
Possible boom may happen for BTC &amp; LTC if it goes well. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 02:10:08
What you guys think? BTC will hit 3k? LTC 50 maybe?
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:08:26
those are too pricy 
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:06:50
USDT added. Many more pairs added! LTC is now a quote currency to show how much we love it!    
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:07:26
So LTC and BTC looking good for me right now
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:42:38
the cigarette is a nice touch. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:14:12
this guy is delusional.  Say a lie until its true. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:16:26
May hit 12k in 12hrs
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:25:59
share this on r/cryptocurrency 
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:27:54
What's happening right now?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:54:51
This is the future of transactions!
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:42:05
was it really a "small" amount though?
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:55:18
Split my dic and call me Caitlyn. I'm all in now. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:30:25
can someone cross post to r/btc please
@_date: 2018-04-27 05:14:18
I simply replied that a certain post belonged in r/bitcoincash. 
I will occasionally visit and downvote bcash posts..
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:27:14
...are fake
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:14:54
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:14:47
I donated to "Exploding Kittens" while it was still starting on Go Fund Me. Still have the original cards. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 04:59:50
they blocked me from commenting....  I was referring some posts to r/bitcoincash... And P0W!!! I got the ban post/commenting hammer.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:19:36
What if I make multiple transactions?  Like selling items from Craigslist? Will I get a confirmation email for the transaction? 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:02:15
Sure man I'm actually not trolling tbh. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:28:30
So chances are any transaction will go through no matter what it will just be different times for each transactions? As you can tell I'm still learning..
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:23:20
Bitcoin community team. Are you getting agitated over my post?
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:42:59
Bought a sht  ton of LTC everyone transferred under a day.  I'm assuming it's all the cash ppl will get from the new coin.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:41:51
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:50:20
Interesting.. why would that happen?   Thank you for the insight. I'm sure others are wondering the answers to these questions too. You are a great help.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:30:36
So if I just use my QR code and he pays will I get an instant email notification if I use my coin base account?
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:38:31
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:39:26
When is it the right time to take action then? What needs to happen for us to take action? I'm thinking about the future of bitcoin and how one news agency is blackmailing a person over a meme.... One day something similar with bitcoin might happen.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:41:31
Great question.  I will wait for a veteran to answer.  
@_date: 2017-07-11 03:39:18
Lite coin seems undervalued 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:41:01
Is there any instances where it's possible to not be safe?
@_date: 2017-07-05 15:59:33
It's a team effort.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:39:10
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:04:37
Close, 2844 
Then again at 2600 
Then again at 2400 
And now today again at 2300....  
Looks like ham and cheese sandwiches for awhile... and knock off soda.......
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:41:37
Which is the winning team guys? 
I'm like KD I will go to the winning team to get the ring. 
So which side of this civil bitcoin war is going to win?  Honest opinions please?...
 
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:09:27
More like I feel like jumping off the mountain.  
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:28:16
