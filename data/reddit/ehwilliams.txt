12% rise hardly means Fiat Faith Faltering?
Yeah, don't know about that.

asked for it...
Got it.

This is great, how far away can you get before it washes out and doesn't pick up the signal?

Are you guys associated with CubeSpawn.com?

This is what mainstream financial news looks like too,  with the small difference being Coindesk actually does occasionally have compelling, slightly unorthodox stories.

Showing what we learn in use cases, with the actual code shown with it to illustrate what's going on.
little vague I guess, but that's what I'd ask for!

Ok cool.  Met James when he was up in SF for a bitcoin project.  Good guy, clever too.  Look forward to hearing more about your operation in Georgia, good luck man!
@_date: 2014-08-19 01:26:58
Wait, so how much do we get per submitted correction?  
Are we talking 1 beer per correction?  And one beer in, say SF is 0.0174 BTC, while a college town beer might be 0.00435 BTC....
Cool idea, cool library!  :)

What security precautions do you take?  Do you have anyone on the team dedicated to security, or is it ad hoc?
Thanks, Jaron!

Are you guys from Isle of Man or locate there specifically for BTC?  I'm kind of expecting you located there, so followup, how has the experience been, are there a lot of advantages compared to say London or Berlin?
Thanks and good luck!

In order of interest: 
What is the biggest order (cost not actual size) that you have facilitated?
Do you personally buy anything outside of Purse.io?
How do the growth numbers look month/month?

Also my bet.  Now to go confirm...

Glad I hopped on today. A few more of these and I'll be rich!

His FB post is a lot more informative than the tweet.  Look, his big beef from my reading, is that any change or slight criticism of crypto is treated as sacrilege and met with vicious trolling and outcry of fraud/crook/non-believer. "Toxic Environment" is used a lot.  There are many problems in bitcoin with little honest discussions to be had on the forums and subreddits about it.  And they don't get fixed magically :).
I think it takes some balls to call the community out like this.  It's not what I think, but it's his perspective, and I respect it a lot.  Hopefully, with someone like him saying this will bring some positive changes.  Worst case he's wrong, and he can always hop right back in.  No big deal, for us.  Pride swallowing for him (I think he'd do that too).
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:13:17
"with the community it has."
That's a really important part of the tweet, that the title leaves out... regardless of how true the community finds it.

I heard that they did a backpay deal, where developers working on the project full time got paid "x" amount of money but it payment for the majority of "x" was delayed until after the crowdsale.  So active pay was just to keep the lights on.
@_date: 2015-04-24 09:21:23
Agreed.  Also, this colors everything quite differently:  
I still hold his critique as valid, but yeah, little too well timed for my taste.
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:58:01
Frightening and genius.  The guy also wrote a book called "Nahe Null" (only available in Russian and German... means "Almost Zero") that basically tells a "fictional" story of how a PR guy creates confusion and power for the highest bidders.  
He wrote it pseudonymously (with the male version of his wife's name) but wrote the forward.  Then he denies he wrote it at all and says the books is probably just fairy tales..... meta.

Anyone notice that, despite it going against his general view of the world he was willing to admit he could be wrong?
That's called open-mindedness.  We could all do with a little more of that.

Well now I'm going to go try this!
But it seems the gold has run out.  Insert joke about gold and bitcoin being limited resources.
