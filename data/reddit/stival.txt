I replied on your later comment, but I would wish for that too. Still don't see it happening, and I think in 2x is better than keeping the status quo. I am very confident that segwit will not really improve the situation bitcoin is in now or in a few weeks/months. A blocksize increase will.
They have been opposing a blocksize increase for years, and from what they are saying continue to do so for years to come. There is no benefit in waiting.
edit: And THANK YOU for this discussion! I am really interested in your (and other people's) thoughts on this and I am trying hard to not come across as some sort of troll, as I am not.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:36:30
ehm, I don't see that. They will not immediately follow 2x (fork), but will follow the market. November is going to be interesting.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:42:19
You probably have around one hundred unused addresses and private keys in your wallet.dat (they are created for possible future use), you need to find the ones that actually hold your coins, then you can import them in electron. I did the same, got every single bch-satoshi ;)
I manually added the private keys by just dumping the complete wallet into a textfile and copying the private keys out. Yes I did move my BTC first and also immediately moved my BCH after importing them
I kept the wallet file, but neither chain has any coins on any addresses that are in it.

"technical reason"?
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:52:06
that may very well be the case, but it is damaging bitcoin in the meantime. Time to act has simply run out. In any scenario, I do think 1MB is too small for on-chain transactions. Bitcoin has been running at or near capacity for far too long.
Any system running near capacity (70% or more as a ballpark number) needs an upgrade to be able to handle the occasional spikes. We have reached that a long time ago!
I doubt segwit (w/o LN) will reduce on-chain transactions in any significant number. It may INCREASE overall transaction number, but not redcude on-chain transactions... Despite any argument for/against 2nd layer solutions, on-chain does need to scale for the moment.

@_date: 2017-08-22 16:34:00
neither. They want 2x, they want core to go along with it, but they will ultimately follow the market. For now "core" is bitcoin for them (and following 2x they would probably cement that for years to come) - as it is for nearly everybody else who uses bitcoin. What happens in november still remains to be seen...
2x - if you agree with it or not - is not "attacking" bitcoin, if anything it is "attacking" core.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:47:15
I disagree. It is not for bitcoin to decide what a "microtransaction" is and what isn't. 60$ steam game? may be a microtransaction for some or a month's salary for others.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:46:45
You can get that site here: 
It does everything locally, your keys are not transferred anywhere.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:00:10


What statement are you reading? They would very much like for core to implement 2x, but if they do not they will simply follow the market ... Which basically means that they will wait to support the "winning side".
Where do you see them "following core"?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:43:57
oh sorry, I did not get that.
They say they are against a hardfork w/o "consensus". There are core devs that believe even 1MB is too big. There probably are core devs who think/know an increase has be made sometime. There have been no communications I know of that outline the circumstances when/how this will happen (for core)
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:03:19


Then you are a supporter of Core and NOT Bitcoin. I am sorry, but core is not bitcoin (the iterate this point themselves), nor any other group. Bitcoin is the network with its rules. You seem to support a change in those rules, but still support a "team" that opposes those changes. I really am confused. [serious]


I support that - replay protection is NOT out of the picture though, and there are still many weeks until 2x activation. This can still be done is MUCH more likely than core supporting 2x or adding replay protection themselves.


Why? They do not support your position. [serious]


yeah, well ... 


they won't either, this whole debate has been going on for far too long ... the dice have fallen so to say, the market and users will decide


Worst case is keeping the status quo, which would mean 1MB blocks on-chain for years to come. (Core has stated this often enough) or worse someone like getting his way of reducing block size


That is kind of one of the root problems. There may be a few fringe elements that wish for that to happen, probably people who put all their money into BCH, as there are people on the "BTC" side that wish the same for BCH. Both are here to stay, both are NOT inheritly bad, as they are simple technology. ("simple" does not mean "easy code" or anything in that manner) I would like to see both to succeed, but I fear BTC will fail if it keeps from adapting. Adapting does NOT mean giving up any kind of "principle" or giving up being "the original".
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:10:20


They are - they are going to follow the market, which basically means supporting the "winning side". AND they still would like to see 2x happening.


yeah well ... they never said WHEN or under what circumstances this would happen. What and when is sane? I have never seen a statement from core outlining ANY plans. I am not asking for a date, I am asking for circumstances and reasons for a "sane" blocksize increase. Meanwhile there is someone like luke-jr, who is actively opposing any blocksize increase in any "sane" timeframe.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:59:26
I for one think that the system is operating near capacity (even if you discard any "spam" transactions), which is bad. We are already too late imho.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:25:53
I just wanted to submit that tweet, but you already did.
My title would have been tagged with [serious] and I really want to know the reasoning behind this proposal. What are the arguments? What would this achieve? (short and long term!) What would be "goal"?
Oh - why is nobody talking about this!?
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:53:40
When starting a full node from scratch why not use bootstrapping? That is what I don't get, the bitcoin network of nodes is not as good in distributing all the data as downloading a bootstrap file - no matter if you download from a "centralized" server or via torrent for example.
I downloaded the bootstrap.dat (shy of about 2 weeks of blocks) and then started my node, whole process took less than 12h. (I have 100mbit down, still even with much slower speeds it can be done in 2-3 days)
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:55:18
That is why I am running a btc1 (full) node. You are right, BUT it would be good for bitcoin if we could just adapt the 2x part
bitcoin has more of a chance to fail if we don't
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:39:00
you could try to find a bootstrap.dat (they exist), this will speed up the process. I did that a few days ago after a HDD failure, took about 12 hours to be in sync. (I have 150mbps down though... still significantly faster than letting it sync via the network) I don't understand why bootstrapping is not used more, there are superior ways of downloading 120gb than with a full node.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:58:29
I'm in the same boat ... definitely FOR.
I really think that keeping the status quo (including segwit) is WORSE than doubling blocksize. We have been operating bitcoin at or near capacity for quite some time now (wether or not you count "spam" transactions - we undeniably are at least near capacity!) which is very very bad imo. Something should have been done months (years!) ago. I am NOT pointing fingers (core blocking blocksize increase or "bigblockers" blocking segwit - choose your foe if you'd like), but something has to be done and segwit alone is simply not enough.
I simply don't get what is sooo wrong about a blocksize increase (I don't believe it will centralize nodes in any significant way), that is why I am for it.
I honestly think NOT doing the blocksize increase (and discussing it for years to come on how to do it right) is worse than simply doing it now. It has been discussed - it's enough. We most likely will have three bitcoin chains in november, we will see which one(s) prevail.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:06:39
We are already seeing what is happening. If there is no need for a bigger on-chain blocksize after LN it will not be used. But it should be the choice of the users, not a development team "forcing" them to use something by limiting something else. Technology (in internet speeds, CPU power and storage capabilities) as increased more than enough since bitcoin was created to facilitate the change, so there is no downside, other than finding out what works best.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:51:13
thank you! The only good thing erupting from the 2x debate/issue may be that not everybody is running the same software. (66% core at the moment - which also means 33% NOT core). This is in and of itself a GOOD thing. There is no "one" group or entity controlling bitcoin (or its development).
Nonetheless ... I would really like to NOT see a chainsplit :-(
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:50:11


I get that argument, and you are right. BUT (yes there is a but) - can you please show how a blocksize increase to 2MB would cripple decentralization? That part I just don't get. We are not talking 8GB, not 8MB (even with segwit) and certainly not "unlimited". The network is at or near capacity way too often, I seriously doubt this will be changed by ONLY segwit. It may give us a few better months, but that is NOT going to change the problem. segwit (as I understand) is not about blocksize increase at all - that is just a side-effect
I have yet to encounter an argument that shows that a 2MB blocksize in a few months is WORSE than keeping the status quo for years to come. That is my main problem ... I really think the state the network is in right now is bad and about to become worse the more people use bitcoin. How is a (that number is pure speculation and just a number I pick right now) 25% decrease in full nodes WORSE?
Also how in the world will a 2MB blocksize increase miner centralization? ASIC and the way power is prized around the world is doing that on its own?
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:18:49
I for one think that the current blocksize limit is damaging bitcoin far worse than increasing it (fast). My argument is USABILITY - for current and new users. I don't see the centralization with 2MB blocks (4MB to 8MB with segwit transactions, though 8MB are highly unlikely, 4MB is more probable for blocks)
THAT is what hinders adoption at the moment. Bitcoin is for ALL people, even those transferring small dollar amounts (no matter if those "few dollars" are for buying a coffee or transferring their weeks salary!)
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:09:06
I am also annoyed ... but still not ranting.
I think that bitcoin has been operating near (or at) capacity for far too long and segwit alone will not be enough. My full node is uploading multiple GB/day. (up 44 hours, 57GB uploaded). There already are a multitude of people around the globe that would not be able to do that. That does not change the fact, that there are many that CAN do this - and much more. I don't see the centralization. I really don't. I only see the downside of a system not scaling effectively and in time.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:15:32
The same arguments have been used against BCH. I don't care if you like/dislike BCH, but nothing of the like has happened and I really doubt it will happen after a contentious hardfork.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:12:51


What is bad about a short term relief AND meanwhile giving bitcoin the chance to prove segwit/LN works? on-chain scaling is badly needed imho, whatever your stance on off-chain solutions may be. 2MB (on-chain) is not "crazy" and if off-chain solutions work (as in: cheaper, faster, same security) they will be used
@_date: 2017-08-11 12:46:52
this, find a rar bruteforcer first, if you have the wallet (I am guessing it is simply a password protected wallet.dat?) maybe someone can suggest a programm to run a bruteforce on that too?
You can save yourself some time if you have SOME idea how long the password could be and what type of characters you used. (small, BIG,  numbers, special, ...)
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:57:36
I do - I really think bitcoin can benefit from segwit AND a 2MB blocksize for a few years.

filename of the PDF linked: "Ledger Receive Address Attack.pdf", content of PDF never talks about what you are talking about. that is a completely different topic that should be discussed (definitely) in another context
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:03:31
nope, the device can not be manipulated to show an address it does not control. That is the whole point of a hardware device.
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:23:32
I am talking about a device that has its own screen, no other layer than the device's display matters. There is no known attack on the ledger device itself. (Not saying one is not possible, but the device makes an attack really really hard to do, especially w/o hardware modifications)
The security of the current ledger devices comes from the hardware design, client software is not an issue, you should only ever trust the DEVICE (display).
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:21:12
it tells the ledger device to show the address of a specific derivation path on its display, the device calculates the address itself (which can not be tampered with), making sure the display only shows addresses it controls
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:01:57










sorry, but you are completely wrong. The software on your computer (client software) is NOT telling the device to show "ABCDEF" as the address, it is asking the device to show the address of key derivation path 1/2/3/4, the address is calculated on the device, and every single address it shows to you is definitely controlled by it. The client software should do the same (calculate the address) and therefor it should be the same ... a malware can not get the device to show an address it does not control.

@_date: 2018-02-03 13:02:53
yes you can do it for most coins. (ethereum included if you use MEW)
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:16:18


yes it is, you will need to enable Browser Support on your ledger device's ETH app to use it with MEW instead of the chrome app
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:05:21
you could look at the Volume (24h) part of that website and eg. compare the historical data of said volume to other coins?
@_date: 2018-02-03 14:02:57
well ... that may be the title of the post, but that kind of attack is not specific to ledger or hardware wallets ... not at all, so basically spreading FUD about ledger/hardware wallets instead of trying to educate people about possible attacks/malware/phishing on websites that show receiving addresses.
The linked article is a pdf which is named "Ledger Receive Address Attack.pdf", and the pdf itself only talks about the ledger receive address.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:09:26
yes it does, if you use MEW.
granted, the quality/features of the chrome applications is far from "optimal", but there are alternatives. And especially for ETH - checking once should be enough as there is only one (or few) address(es)
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:07:18
ehm yes it can ... simply by showing you a complete receive address to give out?
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:19:38
yes you can ... any software can tell the ledger device to display a specific derivation path's address, the DEVICE will calculate the address itself and show it on its display, making absolutely sure it can not be altered.
@_date: 2018-02-03 13:05:50
stop spreading FUD ... being cautious is good, knowing and accepting that there is no such thing as 100% security is good. spreading completely false information is not good.
There is no known attack (vector) for the current ledger devices - the HARDWARE DEVICE. you can get the device to show you receive addresses, those CAN NOT BE FAKED/PHISHED/INSERTED, as they are computed on and by the device.
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:03:56


Definitely not, no way. NO. sorry
@_date: 2018-02-03 05:18:46
wtf ...
the security of the ledger device stems from the device itself and NOT the software you are using.
I am agreeing that the ledger software could be more user friendly, even encourage the use of the display to check receive addresses, but that is all that could be done.
security flaws of the client software are irrelevant (as they should be!)

@_date: 2017-07-19 21:07:25
yes. You can watch the current period here: 
336 blocks means 3360 minutes (about 10 minutes per block), which means 2 days and 8 hours.
We know the block creation is not THAT precise, so the periods can be off by a few minutes to maybe a few hours, but the lockin needs to activate by july 29th from what I understand (my understanding of bitcoin is limited though) to not cause foo ^^
And to though it seems to be unlikely, it is still very much possible that BIP91 activates during this very period.

@_date: 2017-07-21 02:13:26
but can't we (users) enforce segwit activation now and worry about the 2MB hardfork later? I for one think these are separate issues, and there is more than enough time to decide what to do about the 2MB part during the coming months

@_date: 2017-07-21 01:57:57
I am no expert either, but I think after reading on this for days, I get it ^^ - I urge any users that understand this better than me to correct anything if I am wrong!
BIP-91 does not enforce segwit, it enforces miners to signal their support for segwit. This is only useful if the users (full nodes) enforce it. (Start to reject blocks that do not signal segwit). The current Core software does not do that - even after activation of BIP91 they will accept any block without segwit signaling
tbh I think the lockin of BIP91 is the MINERS testing the USERS if they will go through with it
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:11:20
I for one think I am not going to wait with my node ... I want to hold miners accountable.
The 2MB hardfork (that is part of BIP-91) will come at a much later date, and until I have an educated opinion about that, I do want segwit activated asap

@_date: 2017-07-21 01:42:42
This question is serious - no sarcasm here:
I really thought the consensus in bitcoin is about the protocol and enforcing the protocol, NOT about the software that is being used to take part in the network?
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:13:15
no it is not - as it currently stands there will be likely 76.4% of blocks in the current period that signal for BIP91, that would mean about 256-257 blocks for this period. 269 blocks are needed. Just a small shift, some statistical anomalies in block creation (pools that mine "for" BIP91 having luck) and the 80% are not out of reach.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:00:33
if it is basically the same - why would BIP148 be better?
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:38:57
