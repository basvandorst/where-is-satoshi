Haha yes this! All of this! Speed and scalability for BTC is just poxy

thats a great gift.

Capital Gains Tax on every transaction?
No fucking thanks 
@_date: 2018-10-07 06:45:26
You said decentralised. HahhahaahhahahahahahahahaahhahHahahahahAhhahHahahHhahHhHhHhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahHHaaahahahahahahaa
Whenever I hear or read the words Bitcoin and decentralised in the same sentence I laugh my ass off. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 06:31:11
Nope and nope. Unless you buy btc to spend as btc (and hold, never trade ANYTHING) the ATO will Fuck You In Your Ass)

No need to get cunty because I interrupted the BTC circle jerk! I love Satoshi’s vision; but the reality is that balance of mining power and node distribution is Far From Decentralised (as it is today). 
Nothing you can type here changes that reality so you can both mung the sweat off my plums!

Maximalist will shriek FUD but this is clear manipulation in line with gox

The point you seem to miss: it’s meant to be decentralised *and it’s not*. This is the claim of every btc hodler and it’s purported “advantage” over fiat. 
I call bollocks on “how easily” you claim it will be to make it more decentralised in the future. 1) because it’s meant to be decentralised now and it’s not and more importantly 2) PoW alone dictates the computational power required to hash is proportional to complexity, this relationship is not linear. The continual rise In difficulty also means the majority players in the network stand the greatest chance of rising to meet running costs vs. difficulty and smaller entries into the industry won’t be able to balance against their growth. (Don’t insult me, prove me wrong, please)
We aren’t talking about the future, we are talking about right now, the state of distribution on the network is skewed, btc is prone to market manipulation and PoW is not sustainable for the long term. (Again prove me wrong though I don’t believe you can) 
You’re gonna need more than 3 insults to my intelligence in your reply, maybe a reasonable argument to refute the findings of the study I posted in my previous. Pretty clear you’re experiencing cognitive dissonance. But that’s okay, if you’re a prawn who likes to throw insults when you’re holding nothing but your own ass.

I clearly had it wrong; ATO ruling was “because you have traded btc then all your btc is derived from profit making, therefore personal use classification doesn’t apply” (fisting ensued)
Everyone saying I’m wrong can’t have dealt with the ATO like I have. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 14:38:14
I hope I can bring them around to that, but two accountants and the ATO have told me it’s not exempt. 
For context, I used LRoS to pay council rates and car Rego, and CoinJar to buy groceries etc. up to the 10k because that’s what the ato stated before updating the website in dec 2017. They say because I’ve held and traded and made gains during that period they will not discriminate between trades and personal use.. the argue those transactions are not exempt because of the the increase in btc through 2017, regardless of their advice on the ato website pre dec 17 saying to refer to the 10k personal use exemption. 
Between gst on sales, cgt on these transactions, exchange fees and the resulting tax debt I think the only winners here are institutions like the ato.
Also, last time I’m honest with the bastards!

But then it won’t be bitcoin. It will be a fork or a variant.  And it will be pumped to the fuck or demoralised like futures was.

Said no-one ever once they look at sustainability of the environment, transaction throughput and scalability. BTC is not efficient enough for day to day transactions when at the scale of visa, MasterCard transactions 
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:12:05
Technically bitcoin (as it stands) is weaker than many Alts out there as far as performance or security is concerned. And it took much longer than 20 mins to draw that conclusion. Cheers!

if your'e on iOS, have 2FA enabled on your iCloud account, use iCloud or iTunes backup and enable touch ID with a complex alpha numeric passcode you should be fine for even moderate amounts. store passphrase for app somewhere physically safe
