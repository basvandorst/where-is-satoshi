It seems like you are being purposefully obtuse, given that you regularly post to several crypto subreddits, but I will help explain it in simple terms for the benefit of other readers.
    
Bitcoin has all the utility of any currency: 1. It is a medium of exchange 2. It is a store of value 3. It is a valuation tool. I'm not going to explain why currencies exist because you are capable of researching that on your own.
    
There are fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, which are backed by nothing but the government behind them. The US dollar is not a commodity-backed currency and it has not been since the 70s. The downside of traditional currency is that you MUST go through an intermediary in order to use it on a large scale. 
    
This is where banks come in. Massive infrastructure is required to enable high volumes of transactions across large geographical areas. People don't feel safe keeping large quantities of money at home, so they store it in a bank. This requires all of us to trust that the bank will behave fairly and impartially, but we know from experience that they do not. Insider trading, the housing market crash of 2008, and other such issues are caused by banks abusing their trust in an attempt to profit.
    
Bitcoin has value because it has all of the properties of currency, without the need to trust any government or corporate entity. I can transact anonymously with anyone in the world without trusting anyone else in the network. 
    
Bitcoin is also censorship resistant. A bank can freeze your accounts. A government can seize your funds. A company can deny you an account for any reason. Anyone can make a bitcoin wallet anonymously. There is no governing entity to freeze your accounts.
    
You cite high transaction fees as a reason why this 'cannot work', but you are not considering any of the coming developments. Payment channels and the lightning network will allow exponentially more transactions with fees considerably lower than traditional banking systems. Atomic swap with LTC allows even more processing to occur off-chain. These developments, along with other layer 2 solutions, will one day allow Bitcoin transactions to be processed just as easily as swiping your credit card at the gas station.
    
I suggest you spend more time reading up on this technology if you are interested in it. Comparing BTC or cryptocurrencies to lottery tickets is like comparing e-mail to an invisible mailman. It is not a fair comparison because it in no way represents reality.

What happens when the legitimate organization that you donate is branded a "terrorist organization" because your government entity wants to silence them? If you think a government entity has never used their power unjustly, you need to read some history.

Banks thrive on exploitation and unethical business practices, but they are so ingrained into society that it is hard to bypass them. Even of you transact 100% in cash, you need a bank to deposit your paycheck.
    
Bitcoin makes every person into their own banker. You dont need an ID to open a bitcoin wallet. No one can "freeze your accounts" or block payments.
    
Additionally, Bitcoin has a set volume, so it is deflationary, as opposed to Government notes which can be continuously printed. Fiat currency inflates over time. The price of BTC goes up.
    
As more people adopt cryptocurrencies, banks will be completely unecessary for what we think of as traditional banking. Without our money, they have nothing, because banks generate no value.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:54:35
Account hacked or blocked? If you keep your BTC in an exchange like Coinbase which functions as a bank, then maybe. Just like JP Morgan could freeze your account or get hacked.
    
People who truly own BTC control their own private keys. You can make as many anonymous wallets as you want. There is no "account" to hack or block.
    
Bitcoin is a trustless, easily transferable currency, that cant be frozen or seized by a government entity or bank. That is what gives it value.

You are lucky that it takes time to get your currency, because it sounds like its keeping you from panic selling

There are several issues with the assumptions that you are making. "Fueling the drug trade" is a gross oversimplification. First, any currency is used to by drugs. In fact, many USD notes contain traces of cocaine. In some neighborhoods, Tide detergent is traded for drugs. 
    
Additionally, there are many thing that people want to use their money for without government interference that has nothing to do with drugs or other illicit purchases. African citizens want a way to store wealth that can't be forcefully obtained by the local warlords. Chinese citizens want to be able to transfer funds to family members abroad, or to bring money home from working outside the country, but cannot because of tight restrictions on currency by the Chinese government. People who support organizations that go against the public narrative, such as Iraqi and Afghani citizens who want equal rights for women, live in constant fear of being jailed or even killed for supporting what they believe is right. Even when governments aren't being purposefully malicious, Greeks and Venezualans had to watch the value of their currency, and therefore their ability to buy necessities like food, plummet to nothing because of economic uncertainty. Bitcoin gives people the freedom to protect and transfer their wealth. 
    
Bitcoin is not about "undermining the government", just like separation of church and state in the US is not about "undermining religion". It's about protecting everyone's interests by keeping them separate.
    
I would suggest watching 'Money as a system of control' by Andreas Antonopolis. Being a Greek during the world economic crisis, he can give you real, firsthand examples of why a currency without government intervention or interference is a necessity.

Black Americans and women who wanted to vote were branded as criminals. It was literally illegal to vote as a person of color or as a woman for most of our nation's history.
    
Donating funds to an organization that wants to change the laws can easily be construed as "funding criminal activity" or "supporting terrorism". 
    
From your posts, I can tell you are afraid of violent terrorists, and that is fair. You should also be afraid of the people who try to control you by using your own emotions against you.

A lot of us don't voluntarily pick up the bill for people who aren't willing to work and survive because we are busy using our time to feed our families.
    
I understand there are some people who are developmentally disabled, which prevents them from fully supporting themselves. Unfortunately, in the US, there are vastly more entitled assholes who believe they have a right to a place to live, food to eat, and clothes to wear, without the willingness to learn a skill or trade or to take a job that they consider "beneath them".

There are several flaws in your argument.
    
It is narrow. You are only addressing homelessness, while I am addressing aid in general. 
    


    
The very source you are citing actually goes against this. It states many things: Homelessness in general is on the decline, homelessness among veterans and children is on the decline, the vast majority of  homeless (more than 3 quarters) are ages 18 or older.
    
The part I find most disturbing about your argument is the grossly disproportionate weight you place on feelings:
    


     
No, they need some form of sustainable income. If that is unattainable, they need food, clothing, shelter, and medical care. What I am arguing for is that providing these things should be voluntary. 
    
I have worked since I was 15. I held 2 jobs while attending college to put myself through school. I am just now beginning my career that I worked and fought hard for, and even though I am now making enough money to sustain myself and pay the amount of loans I have left, what little extra I have left goes directly into my savings so that I can one day have a family and home for them. Paying to sustain even 1 additional person would be more than I could handle at this point in my life. Whereas your average pro athelete, movie star, rock star, CEO, successful investment banker could probably afford to put up 100 or 1,000, or even 10,000 suffering individuals and still live a lifestyle that is well above average for the US, let alone the world, or even a life of luxury. 


Yeah, I'm glad you'll be able to feel good that you felt sorry for some folks you never helped. At least "your heart was in the right place". Your feelings never fed anyone, got them a job, gave them a place to sleep or provided medical care for them, but they sure made you feel good.
    
Conversely, the company I work for collects and matches an abundance of funds (all voluntarily) to provide food and shelter for the needy. I, personally, have donated my time because I could afford to do so. At this point in my life and also when I was in highschool. I could not afford to donate my time or money when I was in college because I went to school and worked two jobs. I cannot afford to donate my money now because of the reasons I just described.
However, the taxes that are ripped from me every paycheck for social security benefits that I will never be able to collect and social welfare programs that I never volunteered to support, I do feel every two weeks. It has a real and tangible negative effect on my life. These are more years that I have to wait before I can start a family, because, frugal and responsible as I am, I can only save so much. That means less time I will get to spend with my children because I will have them later in life. That means greater risk of healthcare problems such as autism because I am forced financially to choose between having my offspring well after my physical prime and being able to support them fully, or having them now while I am at my most healthy but risk not having the funds to provide them the tools for a healthy lifestyle and the chance to succeed in life.
    
Dream. Feel bad. Empathize all you want. It is not helping anyone. I am choosing to devote my time and resources, my very life, to providing for my family. I will make a tangible difference in their lives. And if I did not have the government breathing down my neck, ripping my wages from me to pay for bloated, inefficient social welfare programs that line the pockets of corrupt government officials, where only a small fraction of the funds collected ever actually make it to someone in need, I might then have the spare resources to help needy people outside of my own family, too.

I'm sorry, but I don't consider "good vibes" to be a valid argument. 
    
Before an individial can take care of others, they need to be able to take care of themselves. If you choose to start a family, your first priority is to guarentee that they are provided for. Once you can afford quality child care, health care, and education for your family and can house them in a safe environment, then you can start looking to improve the lives of others.
    
The mistake a lot of people make is to try and be altruistic without securing their own position. Your children wont care that you got some internet stranger invested in cryptocurrencies when they are stuck in a shitty entry-level job with student loan payments that eat an entire paycheck every month.
    
So, to answer your original question, this is the reason for all of the negativity and downvotes. Telling another person what to do with their money is considered rude, and blind altruism can even be considered irresponsible, especially for people who do not feel financially secure--which is the overwhelming majority of human beings.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:54:06
You need to realize the inherent prejudice in your words. If someone said hateful things about Jewish people, you would not say "dude, relax". Nor would you do the same for any other group except white people. The average white person isn't a Trump or a Rockefeller or a Kennedy, they are a flesh and blood human being just like you. To excuse racism against one group is wrong, just like it would be wrong to encourage racism against one group.

Its easy to throw labels around. I could just as easily call you a hippie or whatever. 
    
The truth is that you dont know my financial situation and I dont know yours, but I'd argue that the person giving money away willy-nilly either has so much money to spare that they can afford to, or they are making an unwise financial decision. Either of those things can be offensive to your average workaday person, hence all the negativity toward that commentor.

Theres a difference between censorship and mitigation of spam. I dont support censorship, either, because it inhibits discussion rather than encouraging it.
    
At the same time, users abuse the system by creating throwaway accounta for spam, begging, trolling, and spreading of misinformation.
    
I do not support censoring ideas. But if you habe a statement to make, and you believe in it, then why arent you willing to have that statement associated with your main account?

There are some variables you are not considering. Bitcoin is not a product, it is a protocol. Any changes that another open source coin comes up with that make it better can be implemented into Bitcoin. Thats what Segwit was, an upgrade.
    
As you mentioned, Bitcoin has the brand recognition. I think you undervalue what that means. Do you know why every movie coming out today is a remake or reboot? Its because trusted brands sell to the masses.
    
There are better coins for day to day transactions than bitcoin. See LTC, see ETH. Bitcoin outperforms them as a store of value. Not just a speculative asset, but as a form of self-controlled savings account that appreciates over time. This is *because* of the overwhelming advantage it has in brand recognition and adoption.
    
You can do what your average Joe does. You can parrot what you read in the news about "bubbles" and "tulip bulbs". Or, you can research this technology and make an informed desicion for yourself.

Buying a 350k house is a mistake, even with your investment.
    
 I live in a suburb of a major US city, and my house was only 60k. It is a three bedroom, 2 full bath, 2 story home with finished basement but no attic. For 350k, what you are paying for is location and status.
