ELI5: How and why the fees began and became so high. It seems counter to the idea of BTC.

You'd think "This is literally money. Treat it like money. Seriously." would be enough. Sheesh.

Wasn't the ATH around 19.5k? GDAX has it at $17.4k.

I haven't even broached the subject with my mom. I can't imagine how that conversation will go. Let's just say she's terminally analog. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:15:14
So, hypothetically if it were to soar to 15k overnight would that be cause for celebration or concern? What constitutes healthy growth, and what's scary?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:55:46
I want that.

Thanks for the explanation. Why is it limited to 1mb/10min? That seems really low. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:49:58
That's actually adorable.

Maybe forcing users to download a random file on a forum full of people who stand to lose a lot of money from spyware perhaps isn't a super awesome idea?

That's like having cheat codes for life. Unbelievable.

Can confirm, am noob. Bought from Coinbase. Honestly, I've been reading about exchanges for weeks before buying, and it's a shitshow trying to get information. People only post when they've been screwed or have a question about a problem, so much of the info on the exchanges is super negative. It's frustrating.

No, it's "all of *A* sudden" 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:39:18
Oh I'm aware of that, which is why I'm not selling when I break even, haha.

I just bought into BTC when it was 7300, lol. Then it dropped 2k the next day, then it came back, sorta, now there's good news on the horizon...Unless it's not. 
It's a good thing I don't have a heart condition.

Well I hope my $500 makes some wealthy guy very happy, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:12:42
$100 richer.
