Like omnipoo said, it's only a loss if you sell. Hodling since 2010! You think I haven't seen ups and downs. :) Only Hodlin is the answer to change the worlds financial systems.

Apparently your not a troll so I'll elaborate, got to pay rent and eat so sometimes I got to cash out bitcoin but otherwise I hold. I don't trade.

Respect for making the effort. I personally never used either site. But I did use Kraken, which cost me some money, in double orders.��

Bitstamp works fine for the UK and are a far superior option to coinbase.

I don't short bitcoin it's against my believes. I only go long. Shorting is just  a short term thing to make money not to change the world. So that's not for me. If you want to go for it. But you're saying if I shorted in 2010 then I'd have 8 times more money than I have now. LOL. No bro I went long and now look. ✌

Always and forever, bitcoin is more than just making a profit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:13:49
I use it. Not only as a store of value but as a means to transact.

Good publicity but I haven't eaten KFC in 15 years. Lol

But you an trade in both dollar and Euro. There are no problems depositing and withdrawing to  GBP. It was only few years ago that only USD/BTC was available worldwide. Its minimal extra effort.

Sums it up perfectly. ��☺

Lol man I feel you exactly, but they'll be jumping on board when it hits 50k. ��
