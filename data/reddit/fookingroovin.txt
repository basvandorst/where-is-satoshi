Just because it follows the white paper doesn't make it so. At bitcoin core we have *the* smartest developers anywhere, and we have lightning network which will onboard the entire world

So you prefer to assume there are no possible attack vectors?

Thank you.

I'm happy to discuss these things ina reasonable manner, though apparently we can't do that here. Come over to the other subreddit if you want. Everything can be discussed there without any censorship. BTW I'm going to book mark your reply. So I can show everyone if it ever happens.
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:30:53
Thank you for that answer
@_date: 2018-07-10 00:34:51
Thank you for a thoughtful reply. I appreciate it

I mean hacked by a real adversary not someone imitating one.
@_date: 2018-07-09 07:23:24


However if an adversary was to attack they would surely wait until there was a worthwhile bounty. Why attack the network and disclose your attack vector when hardly anything is to be gained?

That's the thing. People far more one eyed than me will be spreading fear about LN. It's interesting to see the defensiveness here. Though it's only a minority who are defensive.

I think we will only know whether it is hackable if larger amounts are deposited in channels.A hacker won't bother for $5 worth or even a few BTC. So will probably be un hacked if it stays with small amounts though this will make it un economic for many as opening and closing a channel will be too expensive with any popularity.  Might work for those doing lots of small transactions who don't leave too much online.

There are no "real" risks

So is he saying you loan out your bitcoin to someone who leaves it online in a "hot wallet", and pays you. I imagine it could work, but it would be a while I think before people had confidence in the LN. For someone to do it today would require a very big risk premium I suspect. Maybe in years to come once LN is being used enough and it has been shown to be secure it could work.

Apparently lightning network will be used globally but no one will ever ask this question....do you really believe that?
@_date: 2018-07-09 07:20:52
So do you think they will get hacked?  Don't you think every person on the planet who might use LN will ask that question?  People will not aks or what to know? they will just cross their fingers and hope for the best?

I am writing an article on how bitcoin is "digital gold". So I wanted oms help from the members here. I am interested in what "bitcoin as digital gold" will look like. Firstly I assume it wont be on chain, as it would require huge blocks to accommodate the volume of gold contacts traded. So the volume would I assume happen on a lightning network. Is that right? settlement would then take place on the bitcoin blockchain? How would this be different to the current gold market? Thanks

Some of the evidence points to someone else. I can't imagine why Joseph Vaughn Perling would lie.

Bitcoin is clearly the best. We have the smartest developers!
Lightning network will destroy all others! We must make sure we keep the blocksize small.
@_date: 2018-04-21 10:49:39
I'm sure that bitcoin core and Blockstream have said it is. Are you saying they are wrong?
@_date: 2018-04-21 22:01:11
What did I say that was wrong? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:43:58
Bitcoin has the smartest developers by far, and lightning and segwit. It will win. Why are you even questioning this?

Can anyone here tell how Bitcoin will be digital gold?
