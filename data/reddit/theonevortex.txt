"People have a hard time grasping Bitcoin"
People have a hard time grasping http as well, which is why those people don't write software and instead just use the protocol, in the case of http, with a web browser.
We don't need regular people to understand bitcoin.

More than likely, their local bank.
People don't realize how much regular banks will embrace &amp; use bitcoin to give themselves competitive advantage by giving their users more power &amp; more options through running their systems over bitcoin.
Look, the entirety of telephony now runs over IP, when the banking system finally switches to blockchain, most of it's systems will run over bitcoin or something like it, when that happens, the people will be using bitcoin without even knowing it.

This is why you can't stop bitcoin from spreading because even when a nation state fails, we can roll out a few of these things and still have access to the global payment network that is bitcoin with mobile devices. The same mobile devices that will be in the hands of 90% of the world over the age of 6 by the year 2020.

The problem with one time url's is they can be claimed by the first user who visits them, this is not ideal as I would only like the official recipient to receive the tip. 
So to get around this I was going to request the stack username of the tip  recipient, so once the recipient visits the tip url I would use the stack api to log them in and if they login as the username the tip was sent to, then the tip would send via the changetip api and only send to them.

"Tipping companies have existed on the internet for a long time."
This statement is laughable.
"ChangeTip isn't even the most well funded of them and certainly not the first."
This statement is irrelevant.
"They all fail though because outside of niche communities tipping each other like this one no one does it."
This is complete BS. There was just a reddit post here this morning about how people are getting tipped via soundcloud now. Tipping is happening all over the internet and is being used by tons of communities out side of r/bitcoin and is continuing to see growth as awareness widens.
"Pretty sure more than half of the tips ChangeTip processes are from their own employees too."
This is just pure speculation and isn't even CLOSE to being a good speculation at that.

"The discussion centered on finding ways to emphasize the positive role banks play in the economy and the changes big firms have made since the 2008 crisis"
Banks have only gotten larger and larger since 2008, nothing has changed. They have more money and more power than ever before.
What has changed is technology and with this new technology we will eventually render the banks useless and irrelevant as the fax machine and put the power of money back into the hands of the people.

"Was the world a better place before the petrodollar?"
Strawman argument, the world is obviously a far better place than it used to be, less murders, less poverty, more leisure time, and it's only getting better ect...However this is not due to the petrodollar.
"...consider what would happen in the power vacuum if the "evils"..."
There will be no vacuum, like the internet freed information and allowed anyone in the world to be a publisher and share information at will, so too will bitcoin set finance free. The vacuum will be filled by truly free markets transacting in real time across the globe and I'm not even talking about machine to machine transactions yet.
"Perhaps you think we could survive without any government, and that decentralized systems would make authority obsolete."
No, you are like many who think people who want smaller decentralized governments want no government at all, this is far from the fact. What we want is a government that is for and by the people. This cannot happen with centralized systems as they inevitably get corrupted as history as shown time and time again. However through cryptographically enforced policies we can begin to truly build a government by and for the people. See 
"... but I think you need to share your plan and do some convincing."
Indeed there are developers all over the world providing white papers and programming code in this direction. If you search for them you will find them.

False again. SoV, currency (bitcoin's token) &amp; and it's payment network are all one and intertwined. You cannot have one without the other therefore if you have one you have all (even though technically it does not yet have capacity to be a currency for entire planet, though in time it will)

No , not arbitrary at all. Did you even study economics ever in your lifetime? In order for something to be propagated globally it must have an extremely large amount of value.

No it can't. No one will want to use it if it does not have value. This is what people don't understand. Maintaining it's decentralization is what maintains it's value. Without it it's just another paypal 2.0 or some worthless alt coin that no one will ever use or take seriously because it does not have the security, which again is derived through decentralization.
Taking it slow and steady is the only way to further bitcoin. Developers understand this, regular people do not.

There was a study done on silk road back in 2013 (2014?) that concluded at the time that the silk road was doing billions in transactions when the price of bitcoin was a mere $35.
Today the biggest usecases for bitcoin are speculation, and a means of value transfer outside the state (drugs, gambling, prostitution, ect...). Charity and remittance are also use cases but are much smaller at the moment.
This is not a bad thing as bitcoin will go where it's needed most first. And these are the places it was needed first at least according to the market. The internet too was first used by criminals because these type of people are the ones to use the latest and greatest technologies first.

"Don't you get that first it is Germany and NY and then other states, nations, etc will just do the same thing? "
Of course some states/nations will stick to the status quo, but only for so long, as bitcoin grows and continues to create new services/jobs/economies, people will have no choice in the end to start supporting bitcoin.
Your analogy is very far off from how this will play out.

"Look at how disconnected our financial establishment is from the new crypto reality in which we live. That is THE biggest drawback of Bitcoin."
This is quite the opposite of a drawback for many, many people. Bitcoin is designed to create a new financial system, not prop up the old dieing one that only lives off of greed and theft. 
Bitcoin will trim the fat of the financial system wherever it needs to, and where it needs to is a huge percentage of wallstreet.

The problem is, a bitcoin address is not a wallet, it's a keychain. An address doesn't actually store any funds, it merely allows access to those funds.

I do think that companies like circle/coinbase are the new banks and I think that they are needed in the beginning phases to onboard people into bitcoin. However, security technology is coming along and could be very ready for mainstream by the time mainstream is ready for bitcoin.
Once enough people start using bitcoin and have secure enough technology to easily protect it (hardware protection built into everything) people will realize more and more they don't really need coinbase at all. Also, in the next 5-10 years coinbase/circle will have a whole hell of alot of competition from people trying to do things better then they did with more focus on decentralization. 
One thing is for sure, bitcoin is here to stay.

People still tend to forget how early we are in bitcoin. To prove this point just go up to your local starbucks/dunkin donuts teller and ask them if they have heard of bitcoin. Shit, go up to your local bank teller and ask them if they have heard of bitcoin, the answer to both cases will most likely be No.
Again, there are reasons for this, namely, it is far too early, we are basically at the internet in 1996 stage. Aol only setup a couple years ago, Jeff Goldblum doesn't do an iMac ad until 1999 4 more years from now.

"what governing body made the internet's main store of value bitcoin"
What made tcp/ip be the main protocol for the internet? There were plenty of other choices, but tcp/ip was one of the first and it was good enough, so the industry chose it and evolved it. No governing body chose tcp/ip because no government body had the right to decide such a thing on an open free network. 
The same concept is applying to the bitcoin protocol. The industry/free market/internet is choosing bitcoin to be the main store of value on the internet evidenced by it having the most liquidity/value/vc funding/exposure than any other crypto currency.
"why must alt coins convert back to bitcoin"
So since bitcoin is the main protocol to transfer value, it would behoove any software developer/hardware manufacturer to work with bitcoin.

Well obviously there are already better coins out there than bitcoin technically, but the world has already bought into bitcoin because it was the first and it was good enough, similar to tcp/ip. V1 was quite terrible and did not support video/audio/streaming any of that. But the world had bought into it via hardware and software so there was incentive to evolve it and make it better. Rest assured, bitcoin will never stay the same, it will continue to evolve, we are only in beta right now.

To think if bitcoin is going to be a fad you simply have to understand bitcoin in one sentence. 
Bitcoin will do for money/banking what the internet did for publishing/journalism. In short, it will set it free. 
So you have to ask yourself, what is more important, email or money? Well for most, it's money, and if money is more important then that very much suggests bitcoin could become bigger and more valuable than the internet itself.

This is an old way of thinking. We now have the power and technology to govern ourselves thanks to the internet and blockchain technology. It will take a while for this paradigm shift to come about, for a sneak peak at the future you can checkout bitnation.

It was taken from his most recent interview 
@_date: 2015-09-10 22:56:11
"Bitcoin remains more difficult to get in 2015 than a few years ago when Bitinstant was in operation."
So you have never used/heard of coinbase/circle? You can buy bitcoins far more easily than ever before with these services by simply attaching a bank account instead of having to wire transfer money overseas to an exchange. Oh you want to exchange your btc for other coins? Shapeshift.io can do it in literally seconds, far easier than using an exchange like the old days.
"The price has gone nowhere but down during the entire VC era."
Of course the price was going to come down from $1200 when there was literally no where to use your bitcoin. It's now where it should be between 200 and 300, and it's been this way this entire year making it far more stable than in the past. There are also now over 100k merchants accepting bitcoin making it far easier to spend.
"Let's start talking reality here."

"email is not secure. it is inherently insecure because it is modeled after UUCP."
"If you say GPG or PGP, then you are just layering a secure messaging system ontop of an insecure transport."
Exactly. And we can do the same with bitcoin. Layer protocols and application layers above it to make it do all sorts of things, including side chains and beyond.
"...if we use bitcoin and take control of money away from the government, how can projects like the internet even exist (remember it required heavy subsidization from the government)"
Yes of course in the beginning the government funded darpa and made the web possible, but we don't live in the 80s any more. We now have the technology like the web to be able to do things that were not possible before, like have blockchain technology crowd funding. The internet provided an ENTIRELY NEW ECONOMY to arise, and now that it has it's own currency (bitcoin) that can provide entirely new things to arise on top of that economy, like government and all the services it provides, including healthcare, certificates, law, and more, and all the services wallstreet provides like ipo's, stocks, dividends and so so much more. 
Remember in the beginning of the internet, people thought it would just compete with fax machines. In the beginning of the bitcoin, people think it will just compete with banks. Oh how naive we are.

They predict that roughly 10% of the world's GDP will reside on the bitcoin blockchain by 2027. 10% of today's gdp is 7.5 trillion. So if you divide 7.5 trillion by 21 million, that would make each bitcoin worth over $300,000 per bitcoin by 2027.

"when others who are not part of that governance structure create problems. "
Not in the least. Everything will be by global consensus, including wars, or the lack their of. With a decentralized autonomous government structure similar to bitnation, many nations can work things out in ways we can't even imagine yet using blockchain technology. Remember in just a few more years live streaming video will become ubiquitous, over a billion more people will be on the internet, the internet is allowing us to share information like never before and it's that information that will (and already is) allow people to make better and more informed choices.

"Yea after I hand all my info over to shady startups that exist one day and are gone the next."
Umm coinbase and circle are funded by the likes of andreessen horowitz and google, and even federally insure your bitcoin, these are not shady startups...
"Bitcoin was easier to obtain 4 years ago. That is fact. You could walk into any Walmart and have bitcoins on your cellphone before you got back to your car."
WTF are you smoking dude, you could never buy bitcoin at a fucking walmart? 4 years ago there was only one exchange to buy bitcoin from and that was mtgox...Not only that but there wasn't even any mobile wallets available for phones back then, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.
"There aren't 100k merchants accepting Bitcoin, they are accepting dollars through Bitpay."
Many of these merchants keep small percentages of their bitcoin. Large merchants like overstock are keeping up to 10+% of their bitcoin and even offering bonuses in bitcoin. As the price of bitcoin rises over the years and has more utility, merchants will keep more and more bitcoin, this is basic economics...
"Bitcoin has no use cases outside of illegal activities."
So you've never heard of timestamping with proofofexistence.com, remittances, smart contracts or online gambling? I'm pretty sure wallstreet will disagree with you on this. I haven't even mentioned industry changing companies like ethereum and augur yet.

I don't understand why everyone is getting so crazy. All of these companies still support bitcoin and pledged to continue to support of bitcoin. Of course they were going to expand into fiat, these are companies after all looking to continuously make profit. 
I would even argue that this move is needed because the average person doesn't understand bitcoin, they understand their local fiat currency. These companies have the opportunity to onboard new people into the system by making it even easier to dip their toes in the water. "What's this bitcoin option?" is what most people will say.
The true driver of course will be when the bail ins come and they can no longer pull more than $50 out of their traditional bank account per day. But for all the people using coinbase/circle/uphold ect... they will have the option of using bitcoin and that, is a very very good thing.

Basically first we let the kings/royalty create/handle our money. They abused their power. 
So we gave the power to churches thinking they would serve us better, they didn't, they abused their power. 
Then we gave came up with the idea of modern banks and lending taking away the monetary power from churches and kings to private individuals and companies. Guess what they did the power?
You guessed it, they eventually began to abuse the power as well.

It's also about being more secure then credit cards. I'm sure you have read about the constant hacking and stealing of credit cards by the millions. Each time you use your credit card it is either stored somewhere or can be easily copied via a magnet strip posing as a regular swipe reader. Whereas if I used a bitcoin wallet and did a quick qr scan, none of my private credentials (private keys) were given out which in turn not only makes me more safe, but also makes the merchant more safe as they no longer have to store private credentials like credit cards (steam, amazon, ect...)

There is no way a first world government would do any of these things. No government wants to stifle innovation on a technology that could possibly be bigger than the internet itself, for if they did, it would simply drive innovation to a competing country.

So you don't understand how lending works then? Do you not understand how countries around the world hold dollars with the promise that they will have greater and greater value? Do you not understand that dollars are created from NOTHING? What would you call it, just a terrible, horrible, global scheme?

"It should not make anyone "angry" to hear people directly quote Satoshi when decisions are being made "
No one is angered when Satoshi is quoted, however when one attempts to claim that their vision is more aligned with Satoshi than the opposing vision, that's a problem.
Bitcoin doesn't need an oracle.

It only took a month after partnering with bitmain to change their tune, observe 
@_date: 2015-10-17 14:33:01
Well litecoin went up aprox 3 months prior to having, we should expect similar price increases for bitcoin prior to the halving, followed by a retrace of course.

"I don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon..."
Oops. 
Satoshi made many mistakes, he also wasn't that great of a programmer leaving many vulnerabilities to be fixed once he left. Satoshi is not perfect and cannot foresee everything that was going to happen in the future. He left the project up to the community to decide it's fate.
@_date: 2015-03-20 16:48:44
Completely agree. I think this was a terrible move on BTCJam's part, using already corrupted centralized FOR PROFIT institutions to set rates is ridiculous. Bitcoin is about open markets determining price.

Of course millennials don't want to use banks any more. I mean why can I send an email instantly anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world, and even have real time audio/video communication via skype, but if I want to send $1000 to Germany from the US I have to pay 20% fee and wait 2 weeks. It's because the legacy banking system was not built for the internet and has no hope of ever competing with crypto currency.

Incorrect and wrong on almost every single point. Great job on drinking Wu/Ver/Wright's kool aid though.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:28:40
It's very fair, to change course this drastically after immediately being bought by bitmain is clearly corrupt.

"To some of us that vision still holds true..."
His vision was to give up his project to community. So his vision involves you no longer listening to his vision.
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:09:44
I stand corrected but clearly there was no mention of pools or asics in the white paper. 1 cpu was supposed to be 1 vote. My point was two fold, 1 that Bitcoin has not been acting exactly as described in the white paper for some time now and 2 that Satoshi left it up to us to decide what to do with bitcoin and to follow what we the community feel is best for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:22:36
What's most likely going to happen is that over time (within the next decade) most banks of the world will adopt bitcoin by providing their financial services over it and we will rely on fiat less and less. Similar to how all telephone communication now runs over tcp/ip and we rely on fax machines &amp; snail mail less and less. Because the banks monopoly over money will be severely diminished, most banks simply won't be able to compete with the free market once the world adopts bitcoin (for example silicon valley vs the private banking sector, I'd bet on silicon valley every time).

Some Core devs have already come forward and said that if segwit2x is successful they will stop working on the project all together.

"Without a pool, it would take you on average 175 days to find one block."
Only because difficulty has been turned up due to ASICs. Had it only been increasing with CPUs it would continue to reach equilibrium with CPUs.
"And if you don't find it early on, and your competition has already deployed more powerful equipment in the meantime "
This is true no matter if it's CPU, GPU or ASIC.
"Pools spread the risk far more evenly across a broader set of participants."
Not arguing that.

"the original vision of bitcoin"
There is no such thing as the original vision. The original vision is gone. The original vision was 1 cpu 1 vote, no mining pools, no asics, that world is gone. Satoshi left the project up to us to create a new vision.

Most likely Rogers recent flip flop of forever complaining about high fees and how segwit can't solve it, then recently tweeting about how he believes segwit will reduce fees too much and not provide enough profit for miners.

"A block size update has happened before,"
False, first we had no blocksize limit, and then we put a 1mb on. There has not been ANY increases since that time.
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:30:34
Bigger blocks have not been tested at all, or have you just not been paying attention?
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:49:31


LOL something can't be proven until it's tested.
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:07:32
Most small blockers don't mind a push up to around ~2mb. 
"The only change is bandwidth and storage (mempool). Please tell me you understand that concept."
Complete BS, this could open up all sorts of attack vectors in the code that we may not realize. There is no way to know without proper testing. And if you are not a developer you have no business saying "the only thing that will change".
"Block size is FAR more well tested"
Ahahahahah. Not even close. Please point me to the test cases I can see for myself. Segwit has been on test net for over a year and was peer reviewed for months before being merged. Please tell me you understand that?
@_date: 2016-07-13 19:47:53


Hence segwit, schnorr, ln, thunder, falcon ect...

Absolutely sickening, but let them try. If they push innovation out of U.S. it will happen elsewhere eventually coming back around anyway. This is a technology that cannot be stopped by design. Even if it was outlawed, we all know any and all commodities that get outlawed immediately increase in value.

Except together they create more criminal activity annually than bitcoin has ever generated in it's entire existence.

Blocks beyond 1mb have not been tested, what part of that do you not understand?

It's not useful for $5 transactions currently due to miners stalling segwit. Once segwit is in place we can implement better payment channels with lightning and then you can make your $5 tx's on the cheap.

Think long term. Think the next halving in 2019-2020 area, and the one after that in 2024.

2/The truth is that  progress has been stalled by a cartel of miners for years now &amp;  only has a few million users.
3/I prefer  to be a great SoV over a coffee currency but w/o 2nd layer tech it will only be a SoV for early adopters &amp; 1st world.
4/I support  b/c I believe  needs to upgrade &amp; evolve &amp; eliminate  in order to be used by as many people as possible.
