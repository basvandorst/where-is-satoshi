When I get a job, I plan to invest 25% of my money in the stock market, and 20% of my money in Bitcoin. My incoming BFL ASIC wont impact that percentage, and will only be side money that won't ever be converted back to dollars possibly. The US Federal Govt will take 28% of my money, and the state I live in will take 5%, leaving me with 22% of my money. I think I can live off of that based on the average income of the job I want to get a degree in.

Just to clarify, the method is **SECURE** because I use **Split-Key Generation**. (Article here:  This prevents me from ever having your private key!
@_date: 2013-03-06 01:34:52
I would value Bitcoin short-term at around $125. I think comparing it to Silver and Gold are a little far fetched, since you can't technically hold a Bitcoin like you can with an American quarter. However currency valuation is more of a fair idea. If people were to ask what gives Bitcoin value, counter that with the question of what gives value to any currency off of the Gold standard? Bitcoin as a currency could only reach a valuation similar to the Dollar only if its use was widely accepted to about 50% of the dollar's acceptance. Fiat parity is highly unlikely, as there is no true competition with Bitcoin currently. All currencies compete with each other based on a government standard. There is no competition with Bitcoin currently. I don't think it is fair to say Bitcoin is competing with the dollar though too.

Okok, my example was a bad one. Let me give another one.
Say Gold is currently trading at $1600. Say I started an Over/Under statement setting a date of April 1st, 2013, and a strike of $1600.
The under pot would win if gold is at 1600 or under by April 1st.
The over pot would win if gold is over 1600 by April 1st.
winnings would be proportionally distributed.

I use split-key generation so I actually never have your private key. I generate a key based off a public key you provide to me, and produce a private key. You combine my private key with your private key that was paired to the public key (this private key is never provided to me), and you get a new private key that leads to your address. I never have your half of the key, or the completed private key (which isn't just the two keys added together). I can never get to your bitcoins, and such a process is explained in my post.
@_date: 2013-05-11 15:29:08
ELI5 explanation.
You will generate a public key using a service like  You give me that key, and I will use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (basically, 100% secure, I will explain) to generate a Private Key from that address. I will then send you that private key. When you would have generated the PUBLIC key you would give me, you also would have generated a private key with it. I would never have that private key. You then take your private key, and the key I gave you, and would enter them both in  and you would get the final private key for your wallet with whatever prefix you want. Because I never had the first private key, I can never generate the final.
The vanity address would end up looking like
1**CodyFP**lq23l4hljsdhf0283hlasdjhkq24308fah23 instead of
Vanity generation basically allows you to set whatever characters you want after the 1.

However, what would you do if you sold before a crash happened, BUT, on a long term (3 to 6 months) recorrection, the value of Bitcoin was double of that at what you sold it. Clearly holding onto them longer would pay off. Selling at $45 and buying at $10, hoping for an increase to $45 will only give you a return of 450%. Holding one bitcoin that you purchased at $40, and purchased another at $10, and waited until a recorrection to $60, your return would be 650%. Your comment explicitly expresses a speculative viewpoint. Try to avoid that SELL emotional mentality when a price drops. Instead, celebrate the fact that bitcoin's value became CHEAPER, and not that it CRASHED.

Have you read the discussion on the thread? When I first started the business, I used direct key generation which was totally insecure. As described in the further comments, such a method has been fixed and I know use the secure split-key generation, which is secure.

@_date: 2013-03-23 22:07:16
The concept of this idea goes against the economical definition of a short sell. Currently, LTC fluctuates proportionally with BTC because LTC isn't "strong enough" to determine its own value. BTC goes up, LTC goes down. BTC goes down, LTC goes up. Also if you are talking about short selling using the LTC/USD rate, you would also be trading AGAINST the realistic "idea" of what a short sell is. The LTC/USD value always fluctuates with people's emotions and faith toward LTC. When the LTC/BTC rate goes down because Bitcoin goes up, you typically have people who don't have an economic value, and all they see is the "dropping" value. Therefore, they lose faith in LTC, and sell, driving the value down. Now back to the idea of short selling LTC. For those who don't know what a short sell is, it is where you receive a credit for X amount of whatever you are short selling, with the expectation of the value of that item falling. Once it falls the expected amount, you then buy it back at the lower price, and it goes back to the broker you short sold it from. In this situation, you aren't short selling thinking LTC is going to go down. You in fact are predicting that Bitcoin is going to go UP! Therefore, such a method is theoretically flawed because plenty of people think BTC will continue to rise. You would be able to make profit, but you technically aren't short selling LTC. You are basically buying a call option for BTC.

I've chosen to join CampBX.com because of the features it soon chooses to provide, such as short selling, margin trading, and hopefully even options. They test everything on a testNet server to prevent any major bugs from going through. Their security, and the fact that they are based out of Georgia, USA is important for me. The only things I'm not digging with CampBX yet are the fact that they have low volume (can be remedied by promoting them), and the fact that their servers aren't based out of their own office. They pay someone for hosting, but it is dedicated and powerful. They also have daily security checks.

Thank you for your opinion change. I encourage you to now upvote this thread, if you will. My split-key system works by you including your chosen prefix, generated public key, and email in the order comments box. I then take that public key and prefix and generate private key(s) and then email them to you. You then combine those private keys to generate your address. I'm surprised I hadn't learned of that system sooner, but I'm glad I had early on.
@_date: 2013-02-22 21:06:44
It's nice to see Bitcoin to be that large, but you're looking at its valuation incorrectly. Bitcoin isn't to be regarded as a stock or share in anything, it's supposed to be viewed as a currency. To have a larger value than most companies is great, but try comparing the cap of the bitcoin to the cap of our dollar. Big division there. Bitcoin will never be as big as the dollar, which is one of the reasons that will slow (not stop) its expansion as a globally spendable currency.

The private code is private, as I never have the private key associated with the public key you generate, nor do I ask for it. The private key i generate is combined with the private key associated with the public key you generate to make a whole new private key for the address with your prefix. Its perfectly secure.

If Bitcoin were to crash, you should technically celebrate. Think of it from Graham's perspective in his book, The Intelligent Investor.
Don't see a potential price drop as a crash or something of a bad nature. See it instead as Bitcoin becoming cheaper, and easier to obtain. Therefore, as it falls, I would encourage you to to continually buy Bitcoin at whatever rate you wish as it falls to always be prepared for an upwards value correction. If Bitcoin fell to $2 a coin, I would throw a party lol. I'd probably buy $500 worth of Bitcoin, and hold onto it relentlessly, with spending on a low level of course in order to prevent against having something like 2000 Bitcoin Days Destroyed on my coins. 
Also, don't speculate when it comes to Bitcoin. Speculative interest would involve buying high and then selling low if Bitcoin were to crash to prevent further loss of Cash Value. From an investment approach, if the value were to plummet, you would buy more in some type of investment strategy such as Dollar-Cost Averaging.
