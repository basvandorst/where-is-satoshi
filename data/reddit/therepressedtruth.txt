I looked at it, and I notice everyone nearby is selling higher than the market standard. I also do not have as much cash, if I withdraw money from the checking too aggressively I will need receipts to explain where the money had gone. I can go and buy what I can, but it would be much more efficient if I can just do it online

Well, I can buy an antique baseball card and it will not affect me. How do you define investment and value? There are people who choose to simply buy things they do not need for the sake of not going over that horribly inflexible 2,000 dollar limit, and you could argue that this is a method of flipping items for off the books cash. There is no reason that me buying BTC is more evil and cheating the system.
I am looking for a way to be financially independent while I struggle with going away to college in a market where nobody wants to hire an atypical worker for seasonal work. I have worked before non seasonal for 6 total years in the past, some of which in high school and some of which afterwords full time.
Ultimately, you should desire to see me get off of SSI so it is no longer being drawn from taxpayer dollars. Only 2 things can change that. I need to make 2x what SSI pays me a month since every 2 dollars earned from work means 1 less dollar from SSI. The other way is if my savings exceed 2,000 which is so far from safe since that 2,000 has not accounted for inflation for more than 10 years.
I am too late to get rich off of BTC, or at least with the money I have available. But when the time comes that I fall off of SSI, I do not want to be coming back onto it in 3 months after.

I unfortunately wasted time on some random fake merchant before and had to wait on my credit card provider to complete a chargeback, and having trolls accusing me of being a troll over using km instead of miles. I'm just frustrated and this whole use search thing is a petpeve because I quite honestly used search for many things just to read that exact answer.
I'm looking at Kraken. And now looking at everyhting else in this thread

If you believe in cryptocurrency, you would be happy to see major exchanges making it more accessible to purchase these coins. This is just crypto politics and your opinion. Ethereum has features unique but it does not make BTC obsolete as we know that BTC is much more secure and time proven. You should be more concerned if Coinbase makes it easy to purchase Dash or Monero.

Well mycellium wallet uses km. Mycellium and local bitcoins is the same thing far as available traders. I could be a scientific person who prefers metric too although that isn't the case.
I could show you Pokemon Go reporting NY location
Here is a post from me in the past in LG G4. You can see my particular model of the G4 is a LS991. This is Sprint in the U.S.

I guess when they are the first name given to new BTC buyers they got some guaranteed sales.

First time trying that lead me to a bunch of scam sites. Or I find a bunch of other forum or reddit results telling me the same exact answer you just gave me repeating an endless circle. Also due to volatility of crypto currency I am hesitant to trust some thread that is 3 years old. So that is why I am asking, and dealing with you wasting everyone's time who will find this thread in google, as you suggest.
