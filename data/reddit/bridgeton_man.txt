Although I agree that badecon does indeed have the more dense population of actual economists (probably the most in all of reddit), it should be noted that there is much overlap between the mods and senior users of both subs. They actually share the same backroom. 
The readership are slightly different tho.

Although that is true, it's also not total economic illiteracy. 
They also have lots of senior users who are actual practicing economists. That's what their whole Bureau Member thing is all about. 


I mean....it's still reddit tho. A certain amount of shitposting is gonna happen no matter what.

Economist here, 
False. 
I actually have been able to ask about the results of their current poll in that sub's backroom. 
Turns out that nearly half the readership has a bach. degree in econ. And their mods are all actually employed as economists. 


There isn't actually ANY sub where actual econ research gets traction though. Not even @_date: 2018-01-17 18:00:22
Agreed. It is an absurdly wide gap.

Neoclassical economist here, 
I think that I may have found the problem:


Basically, markets, and market-economics is **amoral**. Markets don't have feelings and they don't deal in subjective concepts. There isn't any such thing as "good" or "bad", or "warm and fuzzy" within econ. 
It's just the study of the mechanics of how markets work.
So, most actual economists tend to view any attempt to insert any kind of subjective warm-fuzzies as pure fakery. 
And they tend to treat it that way.

Differences in unemployment rates between rich countries that are seeing deflation and ones that aren't seeing deflation may  account for why it doesn't crumble faster.

No, but YOU might be.

Agreed. 
Still....With the amount of tin-foil-grade nonsense, it usually takes people a long while to figure that out. Can't stop people from having opinions. No matter how nonsensical.
