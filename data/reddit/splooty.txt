Thanks for the reply. Should I just try to stop gambling completely? I enjoy it, and want to be able to have fun and gamble. I just don't want to keep feeling the need to bet more and more until I eventually lose it all. Would it even be worth trying, or should I just stop completely?

They've proven(almost) that it's a fair site, but sometimes unlucky streaks happen. I've lost 20 70% bets in a row before, the odds of that happening crazy small. I know I shouldn't go back, but it's just so tempting. Just now I placed two 90% bets and made a quick $80. And I  want to go back and do it again already, and I know I'll probably just keep going back until I've lost the entire bitcoin that I just gained.

But I'm just one little tiny 95% bet away. Only a 5% chance that I'll lose it all. I'm so close. Just this one last little bet. But then I'll just keep saying that over and over again to justify continued bets until I lose the whole $500. A vicious cycle haha.

I will try. I want to, but then I will start daydreaming about hitting a big winning streak and making thousands. I need a gamblers anonymous sponsor.

Yeah nobody knows for sure if it's fair or not. It seems fair enough for me, although the random selection is strange. 
I CAN'T haha. Okay maybe I'll just try to make $20 to make it an even hundred for the day and then stop. I could be satisfied with a nice round number like that, and hopefully not be tempted to make more and end up losing it all. It's realllllly addictive after a winning streak.

I don't see much advice... haha I try not to lose, but I guess trying doesn't do much to your luck.

I know in the long run I'll always lose money. I gamble for the fun of it, and not to make money. I just want to figure out a way that I can have some fun gambling and then stop. As of now, I just keep going and going until I lose it all. Which is fine, I don't mind losing money. I just don't like playing for longer and with more money than I had wanted to originally.

I could do that if things get bad, but I want to be able to learn how to control my gambling and still enjoy it. If I have my IP address banned, I feel like I'll just be ignoring the problem and I'll probably just end up on Satoshi.

I put the odds to 50%, got lucky and doubled up 4 times in a row to .25 btc and then just bet at 90% and 95% odds over and over again with the occasional 70% bet.
