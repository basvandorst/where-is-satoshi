It's impossible to perform meaningful statistical analysis on a dataset with n&lt;5. Preferably n should be at least 30.

You do know banks pay you money to use them. You don't pay the bank.

1 USD = 1 USD. 1 Bolivar = 1 Bolivar. 1 banana = 1 banana.

So idiot spouts idiocy. For real world examples that should have prevented the idiot spouting idiocy see Japan.

Everyone needs oil. If you try to buy oil with anything but USD the US government will bomb you into the stone age.

I'm sure people thought Enron and Lehman Brothers were too big to fail too.

Even most of the legitimate companies that survived like AMD, Intel, IBM, Qualcomm and Xerox haven't actually recovered from their all time high in 2000 especially when inflation is factored in.

No. If you think that you'd have to be extremely ignorant. Countries with large armed groups are generally extremely unstable such as Sudan, Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia.

Don't tell the all the anacaps here that. You don't want to shatter their dreams do you?

Because any asset without an underlying fundamental is functionally equivalent to tulips. The people who buy bitcoin are the same ones that fall for ponzi schemes and multilevel marketing schemes.

LMAO. You think subsistence farmers in Africa have access to telephones. In South Sudan only 4.5% of people have access to electricity. They live on $50 a month. There's literally no need for banking because they don't have any money.

LMAO. Bulls make money; bears make money, but pigs get slaughtered, and hodlers are pigs getting slaughtered by whales.

Dutch people are from the Netherlands. Danes are from Denmark.

Third world countries without banking infrastructure lack internet and electricity.

Have you never heard of cash or checks?

Good comparison. Diamonds are actually worthless which you'd know if you ever try to pawn them. New Diamond jewelry is expensive because of artificial scarcity created by the De Beers cartel.

Exactly. I haven't lost a cent on my Enron shares.

No. In fractional reserve banking the bank is completely upfront with how much money they have on hand and should the bank turn insolvent deposits are guaranteed by the government.

Did you even read those? The last time cisco stock split was march 23 2000. The all time high is march 24th 2000 with a price of $79.56. The current price is $42.51 and it's paid out about $5 in dividends. So you're right you'd "only" be down about 35% before adjusting for inflation.

Cisco stock is down 50% over the last 20 years before factoring in inflation.

You're obviously an idiot. The lottery is a coinflip. 50-50 chance. You either win or you lose. That's how probability works right?.
