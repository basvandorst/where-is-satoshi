The way the moving averages have played out over the last few months would indicate that now is a good time to buy. I'm very tempted.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:48:24
Oh wow. I just checked and it's been trading since Nov. Thanks for the update!

I do love a bit of class A Hopium on a Friday night.

Im sorry if this in a faq somewhere already but I thought I would ask anyway.
Blockchain.info is saying it's been 32 minutes since the last block was generated and the one before that was 34 minutes ago. Why is there so much difference between the amount of time it takes to generate a block?

@_date: 2017-12-28 18:06:19
So it hasn't happened yet. I see. Thank you for your help.

Has anybody received b2x from bittrex or binance? I haven't received any, does anybody know if they plan to Give out?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:44:34
Somebody mentioned that after all the hype that 2018 could be as shitty as 2014. It could also go all the way to $40k
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:58:22
They do but I am being told elsewhere tbat b2x is something different. The supposed fork was a scam that never happened I am now being told.

Mother, father.... gentleman?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:47:17
It's listed on world coin index as trading at $400. It was trading as high as $1000 earlier.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:59:27
Wow. No need for that. Only asking a question mate.
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:54:19
It's NEO

You have been discriminated against. But I would call that positive discrimination!
@_date: 2019-08-02 05:50:05
Yup. Thought BTC was shooting up. Nope. GBP falling through the floor. How can a whole nation collectively turn stupid.
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:58:41
Not at all. It's completely unrelated.
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:37:45
I don't think you know what a dead cat bounce is.
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:35:30
I can't stop checking the price again.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:27:51
I still don't think you get it. A dead cat bounce is something dropping very quickly, in a matter of days, to just above 0 (usually following incredibly damaging news (see Thomas Cook on the London stock exchange for an example)). Then regaining to 10 or 15 percent of its previous value through huge volume. Then after no more interest is seen it gradually dries up and the value falls back down. That is not what we have or are seeing play out with btc over the last 18 month's. If you are looking at that time scale. If you are looking at a shorter time then it's even more wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:43:49
It's still 5 percent up on the last 24 hours. This 'dip' will be forgotten about in a week.
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:57:09
Wouldn't it be absolutely amazing if this dip was the same as the dip in June 2017 and then we followed that pattern by a magnitude of scales. Shit... is that my alarm going off.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:41:39
I've enjoyed reading some of your comments and posts from a couple of years ago when Bitcoin was 700. I agree. This dip is exactly that, consolidation.
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:24:28
Tea and crumpets

The difference in 2013 was no one, save a few, thought it would ever get to 1,000.
The difference in 2017 was no one, save a few, thought it would ever get to 10,000.
Now it seems like every man and his dog is banking on it getting to 100,000.   
I'm not trying to de ramp and I really believe in the blockchain as the future of money and the financial industry but I do feel there's a lot of hopium flying around.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:53:37
ITS OVER £9000
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:35:06
I have to get ready for work... The price is at £8900. I'm going to miss the UK joining the Vegeta party.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:32:22
It's not even a 2
@_date: 2019-04-20 21:53:00
I dont know, even r/cryptocurrency is firing up. For the amount of posts there are in the subreddits one would assume there would be more commenters in the daily thread.
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:39:24
Can somebody please explain why the amount of comments is so low here. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:03:53
Why is it so quiet in here?
@_date: 2019-08-05 17:40:26
Hey thanks!
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:39:51
All over the country, apparently.
@_date: 2019-05-05 07:01:40
I wonder what today has in store
@_date: 2019-05-02 05:32:01
I watched a program on Venezuela last night. I visited the country twice once in 2002 and once in 2003.
I remember being in the Andes and bought an empanada for 20 bolivares and thinking wow, this is a really good snack for around a penny. The exchange rate was 2000 bolivares to the pound.
Since then the currency has been changed twice, pretending that the currency was the same and accounting for inflation that same 20 bolivar that empanadas for 20 bolivares would now cost 2,000,000,000 bolivares. Yeah, that's 2 billion! Still worth a penny to any one from outside Venezuela.

You f***** genius
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:38:56
It will until it gets broken. This is a massive hurdle. It might not make it through for months. I'm glad it it doesn't. This is how legitimate markets work.
