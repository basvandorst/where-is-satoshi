You're looking at it from a western viewpoint. For all we know, Bitmain and all those mining pools they run are owned by the government of China, and the PRC doesn't give a shit about chickenscratch like a few million. 
Even if the PRC doesn't own/run/pull-the-strings of Bitmain, they could literally march in there tomorrow, seize control, and there isn't a thing anyone can do. It'd be perfectly legal.  **They do it all the time**. They usually just ask for control, and its given. People forget; While China has become more capitalistic over these past 20 years, they're still one of the most authoritarian governments on the planet.

Doubtful, 2:1 odds he was fronted by the Chinese government. At the very least, he was under their control to *some* extent. He *had* to have been under their control given he was operating in China, and the government there has their finger in every pie and subsidized all his electricity. People forget; China might be more capitalistic than they were 2-3 decades ago, they are still not a democracy.

This is a bit hyperbolic. China didn't attack bitcoin, it was *always* going to ban it. The only question was when. China has ridiculously strict fiscal controls on its citizens. Cryptos allowed them to bypass these controls and do so anonymously. Anyone who thought bitcoin had a future in China was a complete fucking moron. 
Many, *many* people have said this here in this subreddit; that China would be banning bitcoin. And they were downvoted for their troubles because people didn't want to hear it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:38:36


Yes you can; if they were never playing to begin with. China has over a billion people. Less than 0.00001% of them were involved with bitcoin. I doubt the majority of Chinese have even heard of cryptocurrency. Keep in mine the state runs the media there. All news has to be "approved". If they don't want their citizens learning about bitcoin, then they don't. End of story.

So? We're not here for them, bitcoin wasn't created for them. It wasn't created for the billions you say will be lost.
Read the whitepaper as it will tell you *exactly* what bitcoin was created for. We need to do what's best for bitcoin, not what's best for AMD/Intel/NVidia, etc who may or may not even be working on something for bitcoin. I don't give a shit about them, and neither should you. We need to look long term.

You may have not said that word for word, but your company did say:
"*Any transactions made through ShapeShift can not be hidden or obscured and are thus 100 percent transparent, making laundering of any digital tokens impossible.*"
While money laundering isn't in my interests, the fact that you can make it 100% transparent ruins the trust of privacy. Your service isn't private. End of story, really. Actions speak louder than words and on your first test, you didn't just fold, you bent over backwards for law enforcement.
Ninja Edit: And I'm sorry, but I will spread this word high and low to make an example of you and dis-incentivize this behavior for future services.

What racism? There's literally no racism in his comment. I'm pretty sure you meant xenophobia which is something *entirely* different than racism, though there can be overlap. Make no mistake, they're two separate things. But even then, there's no xenophobia or racism there or that would mean any time some European makes a nasty remark about the U.S government over in they're being racist and "hateful". 
You can hate a government of a country and not be a racist. If I hate Ireland's government, am I racist against caucasians?

["Any transactions made through ShapeShift can not be hidden or obscured and are thus 100 percent transparent, making laundering of any digital tokens impossible."](
This means, with shapeshift, you have no privacy.

Because you're ignorant. I don't mean that as an insult, but that you lack the relevant knowledge or information. 
Bitcoin and China was never going to work. Anyone who thought otherwise was naive or a moron. China banning bitcoin was inevitable. Why? Because China has incredibly strict fiscal controls on its citizens and business. For example, you cannot move money out of the country without government approval. They have among the tightest fiscal controls on the planet for its citizens.
What Bitcoin (and crypto) did, was allow its citizens to circumvent these controls. Not only that, but do so relatively anonymously. Given that this is a country which censors its citizens via a great firewall, how anyone could think bitcoin was going to last is a complete buffoon or ignorant about China's economic policies. 
So this isn't an attack, this is them doing what they should have done a few years ago. The fact they allowed it to persist this long is what concerned me. I honestly believed the PRC was attempting to seize control of bitcoin via 51% attack, or through state-sanctioned mining operations fronted by companies like bitmain. 
Perhaps they tried, and failed. Now they're closing up shop. Either way, it was inevitable and it's better to happen now then months or years down the road.

I see it as more that people have "teams" and that people on the "bitcoin team" are rooting against all the other 'pretenders' as they believe them to be. They may not hold any of the others, or very little, or just haven't made any money off the others like they have off bitcoin, and thus are Pro-Bitcoin. They have a vested interest in it. 
Therefor, to them, it's black and white. Go bitcoin, fuck everything and everyone else. They believe, incorrectly, that one will "win". I don't think this is a game, or that there can be a winner -- at least not how they see it. I believe there's plenty of room for more than one cryptocurrency to exist simultaneously. In fact, in the future, far future, I expect there to be many different cryptocurrencies that will have intertwined themselves into our daily lives. I honestly believe there can't and won't be just one cryptocurrency. So even though I hold both BTC and ETH, I don't see my feelings towards one or the other conflicting with each other. I don't see it as a competition because I don't think it is.

4 out of the 5 points are based on speculation and conjecture while another is a straight up ad hominem. You link to them as if they are facts, however.

Not one mention of smart contracts? Hell, Microsoft, ING, Goldman Sachs and many other companies seemed to have jumped onto the Ethereum train for that alone.

That's not a negative point, at least not yet.
Any new currency in its infancy and starting to gain some traction with regards to global adoption would be incredibly volatile. There's no escaping it. That's just what's going to happen, it's entirely expected. In fact, a new currency cannot *not* have uncertainty and volatility. It's a requirement to grow from early adoption to widespread use. It's like pointing out that a baby is in pain from teething then saying "well, maybe it shouldn't have teeth." That pain, much like bitcoin's current volatility, is a fundamental part of the growing process and cannot be avoided.

I think underestimates China. They have a great firewall, internet traffic isn't going inbound/outbound unless they allow it. And China can just storm the mining facilities, or just storm every house with a node. You people underestimate China's willingness to keep control. I've seen first hand China's control obsession, I lived in China for over a year. Bitcoin is currently *tolerated* in China because they're studying it. They know it's the future and they're not dumb enough to outright ban it. They're going to learn the system first before taking any action, so they know what they'll be dealing with when they do move forward with any actions.

Did those other coins have Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, ING and a whole host of other companies buying into them? I doubt they would buy into an obvious "scam".

Serious question: Could there be a political reasons China put a halt to bitcoins? 
I know some people have been trotting out "the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing" excuse, but I don't think China would be that ignorant, especially in financial matters. They appeared to initially support bitcoins (e.g, letting exchanges operate, as well as accepting it as payment for services on their largest search engine which is government run) and did nothing to combat bitcoins popularity within the country. Now, just a week before Christmas, they decide to put a stop to it all thereby tanking the value of bitcoins. Mt.Gox (the largest exchange) is based in Japan and China has been extremely hawkish to Japan over these last few months (if not year). It almost seems like China did this on purpose to poke Japan &amp; westerners in the eye.
People loved to say that China would embrace bitcoins because it could be competitive to the US dollar as the world's currency reserve. "Sticking it to the US" as it were. But that doesn't really hold up. China's biggest priority is on controlling their own currency. Bitcoin seems to run polar opposite of their goals.
