He is saying a small group of people have the keys and can implement change if they want to. You need to keep it simple if you want to understand. This has been a debate about bitcoin for a long time. Are you new?

Me too!

What is funny is how much time you wasted writing that. You must live in your grandma's basement. Literally even being on this forum with your opinion towards bitcoin shows how small and bored you are.

Sorry dude....Monero isn't very popular.

You can pay your taxes in Ohio with Bitcoin and I believe Wyoming and N.H. soon! It will spread state to state just like pot is.

Not true at all. The big banking dynasties are getting in and the CFTC, the IMF boss and almost everyone I talk to are excited about Bitcoin and altcoins. Weak hands are leaving and it is being created by large investors who want to buy when there is blood in the street. You should move out of your mother's basement and get a real job.

No true at all. In times of crisis Bitcoin shoots up in it's limited history. It is liquid unlike gold and silver and no one knows you have it or can take it from you(for the most part). People in emerging markets have a hard time getting their money out of their countries when crisis hits but it is very easy for them to move it into Bitcoin. Look at China they ban their citizens from investing in gold whenever their economy goes down because they don't want money flowing out of China. Governments can try and ban anything they want but certain things are much harder to ban such as Bitcoin. Gold is much easier to ban.

Stop being a dumb(*&amp;^. Money is just what the masses agree to use as a medium of exchange. Gold was money for way longer than the toilet paper fiat we use today. Gold is also just something we agree has value. Sea shells, tulips, silver, grains have all been used as money.

Yep that doesn't help your argument. I think someone nailed it...... 14 years old....you need to learn to articulate your point if you want to effectively be relevant. You sound pathetic:)

Dude it has to be easy to become mainstream. Is that better?

The English language has changed over the eons. Old slang words are now LEGIT English words. Old English would not be excepted as modern English. All new accepted words that make it into the dictionary start out as slang...that is how they become excepted words... through mass adoption. It is a lot like money. Nothing is money unless it is excepted by a group of people that hold it in good faith to be used as a medium of exchange between goods and services.
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:36:20
LOL. This makes for the biggest d*&amp;bs*&amp;t award I have seen in a while. U know absolutely nothing about how things really work in life. A very very small percentage of the rich produce things that are valuable. The rest of the rich just manipulate governments and financial markets to exploit labor and move debt around. The major western markets where hijaked hundreds of years ago. For you SIR/Women? U live in a very conditioned matrix that has been created for you....but do continue to enjoy that fatty steak....

You sound like a complete dumb Most of history precious metals were used that had fiat attached to them. Not in today's world and most fiat currencies don't last a couple hundred years the average is 27 years. Holy wow!

It was coined by lord Rothschild. Head of the most influential banking dynasty to ever walk this earth. Not a fan of him but it is definitely a financial truth of the rich.

You need to learn history. People tend to only make big money when they buy into bear markets and hold. The last 8 to 10 year bull market was only because of the multiple QE's. Anybody who made money in stocks and thinks they are brilliant are fooling themselves. My 5 year old nephew could have made money in the stock market by throwing a dart at list of companies and buying into that one.
