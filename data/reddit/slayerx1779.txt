I read your statements, and it makes way more sense (at least, with the low adoption we have now) to think of Bitcoin as more of a financial commodity or investment than a currency; it's more comparable to gold than the dollar.
And, like any other investment, it has the potential to go up or down in the short term, but as more people discover it and choose to tuck away a little bit in it, it will tend to go up over time.
I agree with your beef over how the word ponzi is being abused.

I just checked, and they have a "troll detector" bot that points out accounts with "low karma on this subreddit".
Not sure they realize it actually just points out "low groupthink" levels.

Probably harder to transport than bottle caps, though.

I love how they compared crypto to one thing: electric cars. How do they rank compared to the number 1-10 spots? To my knowledge, electric cars don't have a lot of widespread use. Are they even in the top 100? 1000? How am I supposed to draw any meaningful conclusions when I don't have the entirety of the data?
I mean, let's not forget the fact that we've been told for decades that all we need to do to curb pollution is changing our habits, meanwhile huge corporations collectively contribute far more to pollution than individuals collectively do.
Tl;Dr I've been lied to by megacorps before. If they want me to believe crypto is the scum of the earth, I need more than two cherry picked data points.

Also, in a truly apocalyptic scenario, no currency would hold any value.
Medicine keeps you healthy; food keeps you alive; bullets keep you safe. But paper money, gold. That just sits there in a pile while the dead eat you alive.

I rewatched it since you pointed it out, but if you look closely, his hand isn't actually touching anything.
