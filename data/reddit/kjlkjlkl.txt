uhm SEPA is entirely free in germany and so far i assumed this was the case everywhere.
but it is fucking slow (2 days!) and it isn't *free* as the bank plays with your money for two days, that's why it's free. also they get their fees elsewhere, e.g. higher debit interest rate, bailouts, whatever. german banks also use a tax loophole to get some deductible tax paid back **twice**! 
bank of england was found to be manipulating the gold price.
**of course banks can offer "free" service to increase their volume if they rob you elsewhere lol**

which currency are you talking about? this is lol.
&lt;conspiracy&gt; oh you mean some guys who trademarked some ugly deformation and are now trying to get us to use it after their first attempt at trademarking the original bitcoin logo didn't work disagree with us not using their version and thus keep spamming here? &lt;/conspiracy&gt;

this is bullshit, you are spammers (your account history and that of your alts contains nothing of value) and it is not a good idea to use zero-day fake accounts for support posts and to downvote criticism instead of replying to it.
you are scammers or retarded, the patent system is a scam and broken and shouldn't be supported and everyone who gives you money deserves to lose it.
just my 2 satoshis.

it's okay that you guys are stupid, but I thought at least the person creating your talking points would have given it two minutes of thought.
are you sure you want to include block rewards in your calculations? because if you add cost of inflation to the transaction fee...
then every bitcoin transaction i make is earning me shitloads of cash which obviously isn't true.
don't believe me? check the 2 year graph on bitcoinity.
so maybe bring that up on the next meeting so you guys don't come across like complete morons.

[you, sir, are and idiot.](
seriously, if you are not an idiot why are you working a shitty paid dead end job as a shill/astroturfer that achieves nothing but hurt mankind?
i hope for your own sake that you never have kids for you probably would kill yourself out of shame rather than tell them that you used to support the NSA or whatever the name of your country's major fascist terrorist organization is.

you are wrong.
banks can transact money within seconds. but they use your money to gamble with it and earn money for themselves.
basically you (or the person you are sending money to) are giving them an interest free loan for two days.
it used to be even longer than two days, before the time banks were allowed to gamble with other people's money was reduced by law.
**this is why transactions in china take 15 minutes**

i see you have never used SEPA and don't know how banks work.
oh i see, you are trolling. damn, i shouldn't post before breakfast.

...but at least we know what's going on :)

even if that conspiracy theory is wrong your point makes no sense, QuasiSteve.
there is only no consensus because the official bitcoin sign doesn't exist in unicode yet. once we add it there won't be a reason to discuss what symbol to use.

he said he knows what he's doing. maybe he put some *real* linux on his phone.
