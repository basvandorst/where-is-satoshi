@_date: 2018-08-21 03:32:31
u invested in Bitcoin for the wrong reasons u thought to get rich quick didn't work out now u hate speeching it ... if u had done ur research u wouldn't be so emotionaly mad now u would take the lose as it is and accept it and eventually double down at lower prices later becouse that is what one would do who is fully aware of what Bitcoin is all about. The fact that u are thinking in fiat and that you are so mad about being 60% down even tho u can afford it proves this point.

@_date: 2018-05-30 12:44:42
that's not true the real catalyst event for the 2017 run up was the greece banking crisis in 2015, that's where Bitcoin turned into full bull market all following events like the hype on ETF approvals and future markets were fuel pushing it higher, media attention was just a follow up event at the peak. 
The next catalyst event may probably be a potential euro banking / currency crisis, starting with italy declaring bankcrupcy near future. Which might change peoples perceptions towards fiat paper money around the globe in such a way feuling a global crisis where all fiat begin to tumble, that would set the ground for hyperbitcoinization and a stable pricing within the 6\-7 digit area.
@_date: 2018-05-13 20:55:04
Paper can not and never will be a Store of Value, ridiculous to belief that governments will not abuse the system by printing more out of thin air, you can actually see exact this everywhere always taking place, if there is a way to abuse something it will always get abused!

I use paper to wash shit off my ass .. it is off value true but still a red cross despite.

remember when it went to 1 million and crashed to 500k?
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:24:04
It's obviously a typo and means $87,000 otherwise he would just have typed $78 cuz cents wouldn't matter at this point at all also if BTC was to crash into hell like say $78 it more or less is the equivalent of it going to $0.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:09:13
I fact checked on Facebook this is not even made up lol, it's actually written this way
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:23:06
maybe one should buy some BCH and then once Ver dumps his BTC for BCH cousing BTC to dip while BCH pumps u sell the pump and buy the dip. I mean BTC needs attacks anyway always remember it still needs to proof it's immutability cuz that is where the true value is comming from! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:07:41
"Bcash CEO not happy" this headline rly cracked me up haha 
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:15:08


ok let's think this further out, Bitcoin Cash has 8x the capacity of Bitcoin currently, 8mb vs. 1mb simple. 
let's just for the sake of the math assume these mempool stats on BTC, which are cousing that backlog and with that high fees of +$50 like in ur case, were actually result of adoption based transactions volume (not spam)! Would we replay that exact same szenario on BCH we would end up with +$6.25 which is less sure, 8x less to be exact however that would be still way too expensive to be used as a currency I think we can all agree on that. You could and most likely would now argure that further increasing the block size from there would scale and keep the fees low but you cannot go on with this forever!! at one point the block size will end up at a 1 petaByte eventually ... now imagine your node needs to sync this every 10 minutes it'd be impossible even 1 GigaByte would be hell already ... scaling Bitcoin this way is not sustainable it's beyond nuts this will only lead to centralisation it is simple the more you increas the block size the less people gonna be able to run a node and particepate keeping the network dezentralized. period!

are you sure? I'm pretty sure we had a spamed mempool back when they were pushing for BitcoinUnlimited and they had spamed it there is no doubt in my mind. We had some pretty quiet weeks recently with quite low fews and dry mempool up untill now, that just doesn't smell organic just saying

you ain't wrong with that, the lapps thing is silly very true .. Jimmy also said that it's an engineering term what makes total sense since a graph theory always is made of edges and nodes and the reason why it's the same simply comes from the fact that both LN and BTC are graphs. whatever :)

He is far too busy to trade crypto he is always on the go giving seminars here, doing interviews there .. also he is not intrested trading crypto he once used to do but stoped it becouse of the lack of professionalism of exchanges the risk to him isn't worth it! What makes total sense giving his Wall Street background .. I can't specifically proof it too you, how would that even work? however I've been following Tone for a year now when Bitcoin fell to $900 after that ETF rejection early 2017 I have seen almost every video ever since, I purchased his TI indicator had few chats on Telegram this guy is real, he is as honest as the day with lot of demand that just doesn't slow down .. 
He trades no crypto just take it. If you believe otherwise that's you making up conspiracies!
@_date: 2018-03-11 23:43:11
There is a lot of time for that .. things come and go others stay and evolve get adopted and go mainstream. Bitcoin stayed and now it's evolving .. all the infrastructure get's built now! Idealy we don't want adoption just yet becouse it's far better to have a solid fundation layed which is why a price correction is not only healthy but also almost necessarie to get sentiments back to the ground .. it's the task that makes you deserve the gains when not getting scared away / shaken out. 
There is no doubt in mind that your mom is right!

as far as I understand the bigger the block size the less decentralized is the network. By increasing block size further and further, less and fewer people would go be able to download the whole ledger and run a node, at some point there would be a fliping point where the blockchain is growing faster in size than someone's download may keep up with, the bigger the worst and more significant of a problem! 
It would move Bitcoin towards centralisation.. we have to approach this scalling issue the right way, as Andreas A. would say, which is the more complicated and time consuming way, part of that is to take eventually high fees into account while these solutions whit their infrastructures are being built and adopted, it's a shortterm downside which however would lead to huge upsite once done right.
