You should transfer to GDAX then withdraw from there. Much much cheaper. I stopped using coinbase directly for this reason.

it’s my nightmare waking up to the fact that bitcoin price DID NOT tank to zero. I would Love to buy 10,000 bitcoins for $1.

This is why I have made myself promise that I will hold all my crypto unless I was in dire financial straits. Even if I do become a crypto millionaire, I won’t spend it all. I will hodl forever and it’s part of my retirement nest egg plan and even when I die, it’s getting passed to my kids. I am a firm true believer in this technology. It is world changing and amazing.

Yes but people will stop investing in the stock markets which are the banks bread and butter. It feels like crypto currencies is all the rage now.

Yes I do and bitcoin is killing the banks because investors are putting their savings and retirements and money into bitcoin instead of the banks
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:54:44
But i really want disruptive panic so I can buy bitcoin at $1k a pop again. I really miss those good ol days earlier this year. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:39:49
Crazy how short of a memory people have. Recall the china ban earlier this year actually didn’t hurt bitcoin as a whole. Bitcoin climbed instead. HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:43:31
No. I’m saying that people will use crypto currency in order to transact money. Banks are third parties and we don’t need em anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:48:14
I don’t see a problem with this at all. Bitcoin’s purpose is to replace banks and wall street, who fucked us over with their shitty CDOs and sub prime loans that taxpayers ended up paying for before its creation. 
The tables have totally turned and I am LOVING the grassroots uprising against Big Evil Banks. Fuck you Jamie Dimon and give me an equity line of credit! TO THE MOON!
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:52:11
Indeed. HODL and BTD. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:26:31
A client of mine forgot he invested 1 BTC back in January and I asked his Alexa how much bitcoin price was at in July and he lost his mind. He’s been buying more and following it all on Blockfolio and keeping it all in his Ledger Nano. I guess I am his paid crypto consultant nowadays ��
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:33:05
Bitcoin is supposed to be anti bank and yet here we are storing private keys in banks. What’s wrong with this picture? Do we need a decentralized private block chain for private keys now?

It sucks when we’re IN the bear market and seeing all the blood red but this will be behind us eventually. We just don’t know when. bear markets are always followed by bull markets. 
Personally I’m HODLing until I can use 1 btc to legit pay off all my debts. And of course keeping the rest to infinity lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 02:41:10
deeeeeeez nuuuuuuuts
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:39:57
But the lesson learned is Invaluable. You and me now know to HODL the fuck onto Bitcoin like there is no tomorrow. Been religiously buying weekly since early 2017 and have spot-bought whenever there is a huge tanking. 
The market will always have cycles and bitcoin has died so many times that i really just grow more and more in confidence that some serious gains are yet to be seen. Just a matter of time. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:13:12
invalid comment. you’re talking about corporate companies. bitcoin is in an asset class of its own unprecedented in the world. it’s like comparing apples and oranges. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:13:04
Yes exactly and right now bitcoin is still small enough to where whales and bankers can manipulate the shit out of it but the coins are getting diluted more and more and it’s gonna get very expensive to even grab 1 full BTC. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:33:19
I am in agreement. Seems whenever we are IN a bear market all the gains from just a 12 month period have a totally dark/negative perspective and the sky is falling and people chicken out and sell low. 
I think it’s all about perception. 2017 saw a crazy bull run because it was hitting new ATHs monthly then December was absolutely insane. Now it’s like the bouncing ball is slowly reducing the bounces until it flat lines. Something will eventually pick up that ball and attach it to a rocket then we will hit ATHs again. Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere. It’s still growing in popularity and adoption. Just wait until $20K is breached...
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:36:36
I agree that better apps need to make the usability easier and better for the non techie masses to use. Venmo and Zelle, et al, are pretty damn slick. Send money for free to an email address or phone number. 
Someone needs to build a dApp that does just this. Ties an email address to a bitcoin address and helps facilitates this all the while helping that user back up their seed with maybe another dApp for security. While Coinbase does this to some extent it’s still not a decentralized entity. I think we are on the cusp of a MAJOR revolution tech-wise with all of this and its for sure got banks scared. The writing is on the wall - we eventually will not need banks at all.

I had a dream that coinbase had some huge glitch that priced bitcoin at $2 each so I was in a huge hurry trying to sell my house and sell my cars so I can buy thousands of bitcoin. I managed to only be able to buy 1100 due to their site being slow and them not being able to clear my fiat transactions fast enough. I managed to suck down 800 bitcoin into my ledger but coinbase seized the rest due to the fact it was a huge price glitch. The next day I wake up and look at the bitcoin price and it was $1.25. fml.

You probably look at bitcoin as "oh its 10 BTC still, and i am growing it weekly by buying more regularly". I personally look at it this way and always want to increase BTC and not worry about trading pairs like BTC/USD. this i believe is the ultimate view of the super long HODLer. I want more BTC EVERY WEEK. I don't care what it trades for in USD. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:41:33
Dude just hodl the one BTC. Some analysts have said it will hit half a mil in like 5-10 years so if that happens you'll be glad you have a nest egg. If BTC crashes to zero then who cares at least you cashed out when you could. Congrats and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:38:11
Me too! But remember, a Satoshi is still mad cheap. Buy Satoshis and not worry about a whole Bitcoin. This is STILL nothing! $5500 a BTC IS CHEAP!!!

I wish I didn't have so many bills so I could just buy bitcoin all day every day and just keep on hoarding and buying. If I didn't have kids or a wife I would just drink ramen noodles and eat water everyday and buy moar bitcoin. I would buy bitcoin and then take some shots of natty ice and BUY MORE BITCOIN!!!

Adding to this I think a LOT more people have gotten smarter about their coin security - myself included - I have to wait for my Nano S to come after sept. 30 but I am not the only one taking my coin portfolio security a hell of a lot more seriously by getting them off the exchanges.

Yes kids are awesome. I have two - and I am going to get them Ledger wallets when they come of age and teach them the value of money via BTC and not fiat checking or savings account with banks. Dimon and Company should be obsolete by then.

The higher the risk the higher the reward. VCs and big banks make bad investments way more than you think. A LOT of investments are total flops. You just only hear about the big wins and unicorns because otherwise it’s an embarrassment.

@_date: 2018-04-28 23:01:18
I concur because this is mostly a supply and demand economics situation. Bitcoin is fixed at 21 million coins and the demand keeps exponentially rising. How much do you think the very last barrel of oil will be worth when it’s all pumped out completely in a few hundred years? Priceless.
