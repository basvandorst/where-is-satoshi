Which ever way Bros. I don't care. It's gonna get messy.

Interesting to see it unfold is all I'm saying.

OR......... I am a billionaire, long or short the contract.  Now because I can move the market myself i obtain a personal ( private) account on an exchange and manipulate the shit out of it and collect my reward on the short or long position I made through the firm. Hahahahaha. This gonna be wild.

If you have it coins on exhange, sell like 30 bucks to another coin and that the nano supports to see how it works if you want to test it right away.  I say just wait for the water to calm and try in a week or so

I agree about the most dominant, but maybe not so much consensus. Too much censorship for a true consensus.

Just minor ripples in the water. This ship can handle a tsunami.
