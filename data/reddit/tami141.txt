I posted this as my question in the thread Brainstorming post for Ben  Lawskys MA 
about 2 hours ago
His answer will be very interesting

I was astonished too,that other exchanges got problems or checked wether they have problems with the malleability issue Gox reported first.
But anyway,Gox is not the Exchange I can trust because of a lot of other and past problems she got.

Hi dblcross121, as a foreigner I ask you:Is this a final  IRS decision?Could it be revised?What are the chances and the conditions for Revision? Thanks 
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:28:49

@_date: 2014-02-18 20:00:11
I will submit this article: Bizarre Shadowy Paper-Based Payment System Being Rolled Out Worldwide 
and he should comment.
 Will he  apply double Standards to bitcoin ?
edit: people,please do not steal this subject
@_date: 2014-08-20 10:04:56
Thanks alot.
I alway go to the Big Picture as well and then into more recent timeframe
Very good article !
I only have a Little critique: a bit too much about altcoins
Edit: I read the altcoin part again and have now to say:it is ok
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:28:41
are you sure bitadress.org has no backdoor or a Master Private -key for adresses generated by bitadress.org?
if you use Armory you get adresses absolute private since the generation is only yours. in Armory you need only one backup for each wallet,you can restore every adress generated for this wallet.

yes ,being repectful is the best way to help bitcoins issue.
I hope eveyone will do like that
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:31:38
thanks for your Information.
I hope everything will play out very well for you.
As a german I am reading DER SPIEGEL and now I am very interested about your "leaks" to it.

only 2 weeks away.The Regulation will be decisive for bitcoin
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:03:08
Hi Michael
though I do not understand all those technical things (I am not tech savvy)I appreciate your comments very much.
So I get an "Idea" of the whole issue.
@_date: 2014-07-23 12:51:47
Very good.
I think most of the naysayers are not affected by the proposal though.
In our Society it is impossible to live without any rules,though hardcore libertariens want it.
Ideology meets reality !
@_date: 2014-08-17 10:54:31
These are my considerations as well.
I think Overstock will beginn first paying its employees ,at least partial ,with bitcoin.Did it already with the bonus-payment.
We have to have patience,patience and patience again until Bitcoin is really mainstream

do you know by Chance what MA or EMA he is using  for the longterm line,mid-term line and short term line?

The Headline says enough 
Mt.Gox down- so what?
@_date: 2014-05-30 17:51:46
for small amounts of BTC 1 confirmation will do. It is very unlikely you don`t get the other confirmations

Hi dblcross121,
as a foreigner I ask you:Is this a final decision?Could it be revised?What are the chances and the conditions for Revision? Thanks 
@_date: 2014-08-18 22:27:43
this is one of the best comments about the Bitlicense Proposal I have read so far
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:41:59
did you try rebuild and rescan databases (Help Tab)?
Take note, there is a bug in the "Rebuild and Rescan" operation, which will fail if the database is badly corrupted. If you use the "Rebuild and Rescan Databases" operation, but Armory still crashes shortly after starting up, you will need to manually remove the databases. Close Armory, then navigate to the Armory home direcotry in a file browser:

well,but what kind of reserve do they have to hold?
If they have to hold the same type and amount they need to have bitcoins as a reseve and they have to acquire it

a great wish to everyone here:
please be Kind,not agressive.
This is a big Chance for bitcoin. Do not destroy it,please
@_date: 2014-07-20 07:06:32
I was`nt aware of the fractional reserve issue. 
I thought ,the section 2oo9 b means,they have to buy additional bitcoins to cover/secure the assets of the customers (as kind of "reserve")
Thanks for your information
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:54:55
it is not a guess,Ben Lawsky told and announced so
The department also announced ...that it intends to propose the regulatory framework under which these applications will be processed no later than the end of the second quarter of 2014. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 09:32:28
I posted already a comment and suggested an update without Gox-Prices. Because then the Situation is quite different as described in the analysis
@_date: 2014-02-17 18:09:10
yes,I think it is very important to be polite and not rude.
The bitcoin is at stake.
Not our personal attitude to Regulators and other authorities.
Please, Keep cool and calm !
