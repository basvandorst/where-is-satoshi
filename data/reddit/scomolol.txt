A better way than this specifically for Bitcoin is to buy more when it goes up and adjust your stop loss so you never lose (except for a massive crash). But hard with small amounts of money, and it kinda relies on it at least going up substantially for a first time before it hits your initial stop loss. I'm not going to make as much as throwing all my money down at once but I can go to sleep without a worry in the world.

I agree, when the volume peters off the selling will begin. Short term traders beware. But it's just a taste of the future for those who are long.

This is because we are heading into a recession though. That's why I'm in both atm. I'll try to sell my gold at the bottom if the Iran thing fizzles out.

Harder to manipulate? You know it's a completely unregulated market, on the share market people go to jail for years for pumping and dumping. Everyone here jacks off over celebrities pumping coins because we hold we love manipulation we can ride off. It's not the grubs that create crashes, it's the 1% whales, all we can do is hope to grab the falling knife.
