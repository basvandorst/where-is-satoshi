This comment is odd to me because according to your post history you may very well be a pro Russian troll yourself.

What's the best solution in the US for crypto to debit card ATM?
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:50:57
People refuse to believe this is true for some reason. It’s blatantly obvious.

No shit. So is crossing the street.

Bold statement but he’s not trading it, so how convinced is he really? Looks like a typical old man that’s afraid of something he doesn’t know anything about to me.

Ride is over man. Find some alt coins that have exponentially more upside. Read some Taleb, take a break from watching prices. Buy some coins and forget about them, that’s how the original bitcoin investors got rich. It’s more interesting and engaging to learn about new projects instead of watching prices and looking at a bunch of bull shit technical analysis.

This dude has predicted the price several times previously, so your comment is gratuitous garbage.

Nice lunch time sale.

This headline is “massively” overblown. There’s no empirical evidence presented to gauge the magnitude of the short interest.

Bought the dip at lunch and I feel like Gordon fucking Gekko right now.

This crazy motherfucker got me into crypto. God bless you sweet prince. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:06:45
There are too many people asking this question for it to happen. There’s so much new money and sideline money getting in that a serious dip won’t be happening anytime soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:10:47
Prob had life insurance anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:19:16
Do you have any links for those top economists opinions? Sounds like an interesting read.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:45:19
Could be. I’m suggesting trading using instinct and intellect rather than fear and greed. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:58:03
Then sell. There’s no reason to be concerned, just follow your gut and do what you need to do. You don’t make money being emotional.

Japan is waking up now. Sale is over soon.

Nor does he call for it to “pop” any time soon. Actually, he says it’s likely to continue to expand and contract like we’ve seen for the past several years now. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:38:36
Dude, no. Just buy Bitcoin and keep your ETH. You should be holding both anyway. Don’t sell anything until you’re standing on the moon looking at earth.

Thanks! I’m actually pretty familiar with Shiller’s work and commentary. Surprisingly, he’s actually not that bearish on Bitcoin. Also, remember he called the housing bubble 4 years before prices actually dropped, and in 2013 he predicted the S&amp;P  would correct once it passed 1,600 - it’s now at 2,600 and rising. 
As someone who has pegged his career on predicting bubbles, he’s the guy you go to when you want to hear that message. He always calls bubbles, so he’s bound to be right some of the time. Bubbles are a natural part of the financial system, it doesn’t mean you can’t make money. 
If you bought a house in 2005 and held through today, most likely it has appreciated significantly. There were times along the way where the bubble expanded and contracted, but over time they smoothed out. 
Bitcoin is no different, except that there is a finite supply, a concept that no modern economist has really wrapped their head around yet.

I would guess most of the posters in these threads don’t even own 1 whole bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:29:45
I would. I made a big buy at a high before dips, knew I should have bout the dip also, but didn’t, only to watch it rise more later. People do t make this trade because it doesn’t feel right to do but your future self will thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:06:45
Good work. Took me several missed dips to learn to make this trade.
