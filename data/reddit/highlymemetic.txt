The currency of the system is inseparable from the system itself - each one enables the other: no one would use fiat if not for legal tender laws forcing them to.
Coincidentally, Bitcoin the protocol is also inseparable from bitcoin the currency; and what a happy marriage that is! :)

Yes! TotalBiscuit and Axiom are great guys, with a large reach.  Do it :)

This thread makes me happy. Behind all the speculation and FUD, Bitcoin really is revolutionary.
Now to buy some more...

Really love these guys

I changed my BitcoinQT password - will my old backups still open with the previous password?

Why on earth hasn't arbitrage driven the UK spread down on localbitcoins? I'm still seeing 5-6% above spot at best - which is about what it costs in fees and bad exchange rates to get GBP to Stamp :(

I registered on Reddit just to post: love your site, particularly the articles on the Regression Theorem.
More content please!

It fills me with great joy seeing altcoins tank
@_date: 2014-04-26 18:38:01
Buy and holders
@_date: 2014-03-15 13:35:24
No. Buy and hold.

Nice beg thread
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:12:08
Still US-centric. When will the UK get easy access to bitcoin without absurd spreads :(

Another great article from the guys over at the Mises Circle. Check out their other articles, if you haven't already.

Everyone needs to read, re-read and read again the content over at the Nakamoto Institute:

Stop referring to Gox malinvestment in terms of victimhood - the risk premium was reflected in the price spread: anyone putting money in knew this was a possibility. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 03:04:09
Yup, without hoarders, Bitcoin would have no value.

It's only inconvenient because of government regulations - you don't think the market is ready and waiting to provide US exchanges, if only they were allowed?

If you want Bitcoin to succeed, don't spend it; hoard: 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:36:27
wow, that is a terrible security oversight that isn't well-known.

Banking is probably the most heavily regulated industry in the world: because of this, there is no competition to drive down costs, such as the one you've mentioned.
No regulation is the answer, not more.

No altcoin can succeed. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:37:32
It's been said before: if you want bitcoin to succeed, hoard!
