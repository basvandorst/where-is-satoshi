When I read this, I immediately thought of a slate.com article I read back in 2010 where they teach you how to make your own television commercials, and broadcast them, for as little as $100.  Here's the blurb and the video:
Slate ad critic Seth Stevenson tries out a Google service that allows you to run your own commercial on national TV for as little as $100.

the two main reasons I don't like the sunlot plan:
1) we the mtgox customers are only getting 16.5% of the new mtgox, and we don't actually get equity, we are treated **as if** we get equity, as indicated here:
"Importantly, it should be noted that contrary to what has been reported in the media, customers will not automatically receive an actual interest in New Mt. Gox, but rather will be treated “as if they hold … a stake in New Mt. Gox” and will receive their proportional, potential upside accordingly, but they will not automatically be equity holders of New Mt. Gox."
2) We know for certain mtgox only has 202,000 btc, and assuming no other btc are found, that means we the mtgox customers get back about 20% of what we lost, and we trade 80% of what we lost, or about 650,000 btc, for 16.5% of the new company that we are treated as if we own.  That means Sunlot believes the new mtgox is worth about 3,939,393 btc.  Given today's rate of $440 for 1 bitcoin, Sunlot has a rather high valuation of the new mtgox: $1,733,333,333 USD!  Phoenix gox, with its 127,000 person customer list, worth more than $1.7 billion dollars?!  That's about 30% of the market capitalization value of bitcoin itself.

do you think there is a connection between this bitcoin conspiracy and the murders of JFK, Lee Harvey Oswald, and I believe the murder of Jack Ruby and the 9/11 truthers who believe the US Government destroyed the twin towers?

I know right?  Ross Ulbricht and Charlie Shrem are facing major charges and potential decades, maybe a lifetime, in prison, and the crooked British bank HSBC, which got its start helping to run opium into China, pays a small percentage of its net worth in fines (about 11.4% of its **profits** in 2011).  The Justice Department decides the bank is too big to fail, and so its entire chief executive staff, who admitted to laundering actual drug profits from actual multinational drug cartels for a decade, do not spend a single day in jail or pay a single dollar in fines, which means of course the people running the bank are too big to jail.

First of all, we don't even know if you are who you say you are.  You haven't been verified by reddit yet.  And even if you are who you say you are, the advice you are dispensing could all be designed to spread FUD and drum up business for yourself and your law practice, so you can start charging clients billable hours for your "services".  FinCEN only recently stated that virtual currency miners and investors aren't subject to money transmitting laws, and the fact is no one really knows yet whether FinCEN will consider bitcoin currency.  If FinCEN does, it would be in direct collision with the IRS ruling that bitcoin should be treated as property for federal tax purposes.  Right now this is only **your** interpretation, not backed up by any applicable regulation or law.  For people who have real questions, get it straight from the horse's mouth, and not from some guy who may be trying to profit off your fear, as many people are attempting to do.  If you have concerns, call FinCEN’s Regulatory Helpline at (800) 949-2732
