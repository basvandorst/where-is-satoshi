It's clearly a bubble. Such a fast growth is totally unstable.

70.000€ for a bitcoin sounds like march or april

blog.unocoin. Are you serious? That's your source?
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:27:01
Because banks have already enough employees. You can't compare those to exchanges.

Get your currencies straight and then try again. There's no need to throw all the different dollars around. And just round to 0.002.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:02:56
The worst thing is that nobody knows what the fuck is going on. There's no flippening, no Mt Gox or whatever. Kraken is back online, LN is making progress, korea isn't banning anything, so it should go up instead. It's just confusing. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 14:17:34
You are tearing me apart, roger
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:17:14
Wouldn't be their best strategy to take turns in longing and  shorting? Doubling it in december, halfing in january, doubling again next month. Bringing down the price too much would kill the market and they would lose their playground.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:33:46
The euro market went down the last days. It was 12-13k the last week, but 11-12k this week. But you're right, it went up to 12600 in the last minutes. My fault.

No. 9500 was the all time high before the little dip and until yesterday it was about 9680. At least on kraken.

Pls respond

No. Only the the first few coins to sell are worth the current price. Try selling 10 Million BTC für 12k. No chance. That's why market caps are utter bullshit and totally pointles.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:31:56
I don't think so. 13th salary, money gifted from the elderly to the bitcoin buying younglings. Whoever needed money for presents should have sold some weeks ago. Maybe before the black friday madness. Now it's too late.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:50:00
Every dip dips to the last all time high. The next dip will go down to 11k.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:43:50
Like everyday.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:56:55
I hope you are right
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:51
That's it. The bubble did burst. Bitcoin is dead. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:18:59
So we are gonna stay below or above 10k?
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:20:23

Why not posting a real source instead of this? If the group has anything to say, let them say it.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:26:22
Let's be honest: Bull wins. If they fuck the market, nobody would be interested in buying anything that is related to bitcoin. But if we see 30% every month they can make a lot of money, as well as their clients.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:54:19
So what? That's still more than a hundred times your initial investment.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:06:13
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:58:34
Am I the only one who doesn't care about this? Why should they fuck the market when the market's rapid growth is the only reason people are interested in buying their futures? That's like selling cars but burning down gas stations.

decentralize.today sounds like a real objectice and neutral source. The article is just a bad copy of the "Bitcoin crashes all the time" video.

@_date: 2017-12-16 21:07:34
We don't have any new memes. Vegeta at 9k, moon at 10k, that's it. Now it's just reposting with new numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:01:24
Because it tells us that we are doing something wrong without giving any explanation. If we are so wrong, shouldn't we just sell and leave the elitists here behind? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:52:14
Oh boy

The market is moving sideways and no money is entering the market due to the holidays and the weekend. Wait until wednesday or thursday to see it rise again.

While you spend your time hodling, I studied the fork

Doesn't this translate to "11k W"?

Lightning network is nearly ready. This is huge and a real reason for people to be more confident in btc.

Negative. There's a preview in which they talk about btc being worth 5000 dollars. Which is utterly disgusting.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:08
Thanks. You just created a 2000 dollar dip.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:41:45
And while others forked, you studied the blade.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:10:46
It drives me mad. Seriously. It feels so wrong. Like a trap. Like the truman show perhaps. Winning the lottery every single day is just fucked up.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:45:40
Just remember: Market caps involve all ever mined bitcoins, but most of them are lost forever.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:48
It crashed 4 weeks ago when segwit2x was canceled. And in the end of september. And a little bit after the btg fork.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:19:59
Why do you call it purchased? It's still for sale. And probably a scam, too.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:56:38
It is just a big fuck you to my bank.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:21:20

What happened to the Mt Gox wallets? Yesterday they went down to 75 wallets containing about 2000 btc each and today they are up to 80 * 2000btc
@_date: 2018-03-11 16:14:04
In december they said it will rise in january because everybody sold to buy christmas presents. In january they said the whales will long bitcoin in february. Then they said nothing because it turned into a bloody mess.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:09:51
When will the long futures start to pump? It feels like someone is driving the price down so they can buy in cheaper.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:25:26
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:16:13
I didn't buy after 10k, but there was a dip every month before. Segwit2x, Roger's attacks, JP Morgans manipulation. Most people thought this bullshit was over and btc can mature now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:58:09
Why are you so sure?
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:22:18
Why not? Yesterday was some movement but it's back to normal now.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:19:18
Do you like Rick and Morty?
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:49:29
Then we can wait for the weekend dip as well.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:42:06
But seriously: It won't change anything. So many good news and we are still falling.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:55:00
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:32:51
Below the last ATH should be clear enough.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:21:30
Becaus selling now and buying tomorrow is how you get more btc.

@_date: 2018-02-06 04:07:36
Why do you want to buy? It goes down by 10 to 20% per day.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:18:42
How does this affect bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:08:02
I didn't have any problems sending my coins yesterday
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:35:59

I'm a 27 year old and I think you're right
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:26:25
I could lose my initial investment. And I don't want to, to be honest.
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:59:58
Why is everybody so confident that the dip is over?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:44:32
Why should the market care?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:12:41
What's the problem saving the last remaining gains and waiting for the dip to end? I hodled but it's getting harder every day.
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:01:14
What a cringeworthy circle jerk
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:59:50

@_date: 2018-02-25 20:45:41
Millions of people believed in the endsieg, too. It didn't help.
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:33:37

@_date: 2018-02-01 23:02:27
Now. The futures are going long in february, so someone will pump the price steadily over the next 4 weeks.
