I want one but can't afford one. Congrats!

All good. I'm glad some people are about keeping this place a good community. Keep up the hard work (calling out dumb people)! Thanks!

Uh, I never begged.... I was asked to write my wallet out. Post was removed (or deleted, probably from the amount of other people begging). I wouldn't beg anyways since people worked for their money to put into crypto (like their crypto wasn't free) but thanks for checking! 
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

Oh wow it was almost half off. I don't know if I want to wait that long for a deal again though...maybe I shall see. Thank you and Happy Holidays!

This was the exact list I was looking for! I'll be picking up myself the nano S as well sometime soon!
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:45:39
Yeah this should solve the issue! Do you know where I can get a list of the Alt coins the Nano S can hold or can it hold any of them?

How does your day to day look like?
Are you guys day trading or what kind of strategy do you guys employ?
Thanks for the AMA!

I mean I didnt own a lot (probably like half a coin).... but it was my savings I was trying to cash out. 
People say being rich isnt the best... but it beats being poor lol
And thanks man! Hopefully they can sort it out and maybe I can get something back. Just a bummer that me not being able to withdraw wasn't some customer service problem but the company going under.. which still baffles me :'(

Well I'm sad. I transferred my bitcoins to QCX and was in the process and this happened. I didn't even leave my coins parked there. Just bad timing on my part... RIP life
