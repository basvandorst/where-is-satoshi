investing money in loan is a HORRIBLE idea
PLEASE cease with this process

Investing is always always always a risk. There is zero guarantee that I won wake up tomorrow to see that my investment portfolio and bitcoin now equal 5 dollars. Save about 4-6 months of income and put the rest into bitcoin or diversify with stocks. If you do not know about stocks learn and in the meantime place the money in bitcoin.

How have you been managing the transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:16:52
if the loan is co-signed then yes upon your death the person who co-signed has to pay

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:53

Why is he a hero? I do not see anything that he has done which gives him that merit

There are totally new different levels of opsec that are opened up when you are the founder and head operator of a massive drug market on the dark net which do not apply to the rest of the general population. Using windows and tor is definitely not advisable  for privacy however,  for the average joe it does not matter and just using a VPN provides enough cover.

Hire him for what reason? He was a horrible owner of an underground market and had 0 opsec. Not every criminal that the government arrests can fit in the fantasy of being released after 3-5 years and landing a job working for the government. These are left reserved for this who have value and bring valuable skills to the table.

Well thats just one very small fraction of what was on SR...general consensus was that he wanted people to have freedom to put in whatever they want into them without having government tell them what to do and he wanted to make money off of it.
There was not any robin hood aspect of him doing it to help people who needed drugs to cure their illness and etc.
