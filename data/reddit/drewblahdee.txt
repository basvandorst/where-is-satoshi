We found the cause of the spike!
@_date: 2017-02-09 09:02:15
A good compromise would be SegWit/bocksize increase hard fork. 
I'm pro-SegWit and pro-block size increase.  
A hard fork is in our future eventually, I'd say do it now and join forces instead of staying divided. 
Another concern is weather or not miners would vote on SegWit at all. 
Any thoughts?

No worries.  There's a lot of good info in this sub. Just ignore the abrasive comments and keep learning.  The tech is a game changer and your small investment could provide all you'll need in retirement... or you could be out the 10 coins.  No biggie if you lose it, huge potential for astronomical gains. 
Some of the comments suggesting a hardware wallet like Trezor are highly advised.  Even though it's just 10 coins could turn into something quite tempting for a hacker to target if not secured correctly.  Bitcoin exchanges hold your coins for you and are subject to attack.  The Trezor is about $100usd. 
Once you learn enough to truly understand what Bitcoin is and its potential you'll know if you should invest more or not.  Good luck and get educated my friend.

I tell all my friend to "just buy 1 for retirement" if I'm right it doesn't matter what the price does or if it's a good buy right now.  If I'm wrong they lose $1125... that's play money in my world. 
What your post says about you, are you ready cuz this is gonna hurt your feelings a little...
[insert your self esteem and financial profile here]
Your opinions are your right to have but it also says a lot about who you are as a person.  You might read this comment and think I'm an asshole but I'm ok with people thinking that, I am an asshole.  The question is am I okay with posting something that makes me sound like my disapproval of others personal opinions should be considered everyone.  Personally I'm surprised ppl aren't throwing every expletive in the book at you.  
My personal experience has been every traditional investor in my life has begged me to sell starting back when a Bitcoin was very small and I don't ask them to stop I simply say back, "just buy one" because if I'm right they'll thank me later, if I'm wrong they're out $1125. 
I hope you have an opposing view to draw from here.  Let ppl have their opinion.

Turns out 1 Bitcoin is a lot... 0.0001% (approx 700,000 holders, I may be wrong) of the population has some right?  In comparison, if every person on earth owned an equal amount of BTC with current supply that would be approx 0.0025btc so 1 is a fuckin lot man!  Most people here have much more than that and the rest of the world is clueless right now.

With that kind of purchase I'd sign up on a BTC exchange b/c their fees are by far cheaper than say Coinbase, then transfer the coin to a hardware wallet like Trezor.  Note: this isn't the easiest way but it's not really hard either, it's just time consuming. 
More info at 
Cost is $99usd + shipping.  Only buy from this site.  They are backlogged, it'll take about a month to get it. 
Alternatively, buy another hardware wallet for cold storage but I won't recommend one as I've only used Trezor. 
Hope this helps in your search.  Good luck.

Nope.  Depends on which exchange you buy it from and what fiat you use.  Last week a Brazilian exchange was selling 1 btc = R2,800 Brazil = $950 usd but buying in usd from different exchange was $1020.

Your 1st reason is spot on, the second is where it gets tricky.  There are a few things to take into consideration... 
1. It's still an experiment (it's never going away), governments could find it threatening and impose regulation making it difficult to trade for fiat, note the recent crack down in China.  If something similar happened in the US it could significantly impact price and drive it "underground" so to speak. There are ways around regulation but without mass adoption there's no guarantee it will continue to outpace other stores of value. 
2. I agree with you that Bitcoin is low risk if you hold your private keys securely but that's only applicable right now, technology moves fast so you'll have to stay up to date on new threats that present themselves, much more so than a traditional investment. 
3. Right now Bitcoin has the largest network effect but as we've seen over the last couple of months it could be dethroned by another alt coin or (long term it's more likely) one that hasn't even been developed yet which ties into my  you have to stay up to date more so than any other investment. 
These are just a few of the things I chew on when thinking about Bitcoin long term. The list could go on about all the things to consider but for now I HODL. I have high hopes for this wild ride!

I previously commented that Coinbase takes a premium + % but I may be wrong about that. I am playing around on an exchange for the 1st time and noticed the same thing but it's pegged to the highest buy order and the lowest sell order. Coinbase may very well be doing this because they need to guarantee themselves that your buy/sell will be bought/sold simultaneously on the open market. This makes the most sense and when I called it a premium it suggests that Coinbase is taking profit above their advertised % which may not be the case. I still could be wrong about this but until today I thought they were weaselling more $$$ out of their users. Coinbase, I apologize if the latter is true because I've talked some shit about you. If anyone knows for sure please chime in.

All of you have good points here.  If banks are involved it "could" be bad news.  It's up to the one asking the question to find the answer.  Instead of arguing with how ridiculous you sound I did some research.  I could have trolled the shit outta you but a simple google search revealed: 
 
The answer you're looking for. 
It turns out venture capital firms invested in blockstream which is what Roger was specifically referring to when he said $75m (or close to that  in funding from banks.  I'd like to point out that Blockstream isn't Bitcoin core tho.  That's where Roger got it wrong.  It's a separate company that contributes a lot to core dev to further their business.  The VC's invest in them in hopes of utilizing the technology they create. The VC's want Blockstream's sidechain tech to work so they can transfer digital assets and save a lot of money doing it.  Yes VC's are invested in Blockstream, yes Blockstream contributes to Core and no it's not a bad thing.  VC investment in the BTC space is what's creating all this cool shit you'll be able to enjoy in the near future.

It takes a lot of work to use Bitcoin anonymously. Don't use Bitcoin for illegal transactions.  Use a different coin that works for things like that. 
Also, if you have any part of your identity (ie buying with debit card) attached to your wallet it will be easy for authorities to find out where the Bitcoin went.  Most darkweb darknet wallet addresses are tracked. Someone even made an artistic graph that shows this data. 
If you're confused about the process of buying on darknet/web then do more research but I can't help you with that because I've never done it.

They charge a premium when you buy or sell. The total fee + premium is approx. 2.25%. I've purchased a lot of btc thru Coinbase and don't mind the fee because it's convenient.  Localbitcoin sellers (usually) charge charge a bit more than this so for me it's worth it.  I recently looked into trading accounts which have a lower fee if you buy in large enough quantity.  If you're not happy with the premium + fees I'd look somewhere else.  In my neck of the woods they have Bitcoin meetups and someone there is usually willing to sell for spot, no fees.  Although I haven't done this yet it's an option worth looking into.  Good luck
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:59:56
You did clarify 
@_date: 2017-02-06 06:09:10
It's called arbitrage and it happens daily. It helps even the price out thru all exchanges. This seems like a shameless click-bait add to get ppl to the exchange. 
I just check the exchange rate and they're selling 1btc for $915usd. If you had active accounts at multiple exchanges you could make a lot of money right now but I don't and I'd have to have an establish (trusted) relationship with them. I also don't know their rules like withdrawal times etc. 
Liquidity could be a major issue as well.  Their trading value is very low.
Only take the risk if you can lose the btc. Seems to good to be true and you know what they say about that
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:06:37

@_date: 2017-03-14 07:23:00
 It's extremely hard to make the right call trading especially if you have a lot of skin in the game.  Do not trade with $$$ your emotionally connected to, that leads to mistakes.  I was 90% sure the ETF would get denied but that 10% kept me in hoping for a miracle (I couldn't get past the great feeling if it got approved) so I made a mistake.  Only trade with play money that you're not afraid to lose. 
 Stop lose has caused many a heartache.  Do a lot of research about when to use them. Read the horror stories about them too. 
 Poloniex has USDT which is pegged to the dollar and is very useful to get in and out. 
 Do a lot of research on all aspects of trading and start small... or not.  
Have fun with it, good luck. Also, checkout r/bitcoinmarkets, you'll find a lot of trader experience there.

I'm open to learn as much as I can. Been sucked down the rabbit hole for a while now.  Apparently I must reread the white paper.  My theory was based on the blocksize debate and Unlimited's stance on that rather than the white paper maybe.  My understanding of Satoshi's view is do create bigger and bigger blocks... maybe I'm wrong there too. Personally I'd be in favor of a 2mb block if mining was more distributed but for now SegWit w/ LN seems the right direction
@_date: 2017-03-27 06:25:02
What does "lost" really mean tho? Admitting defeat and giving into SegWit or that they're beat and moving to plan B, the fork?  Is choppy water still ahead?
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:48:36
I've listened to both sides of the argument.  My understanding is Ver wants an immediate solution to high tx fees which is vital to his interests and doesn't see SW as an immediate solution bc the scaling benefits would happen over a period of time rather than immediately. That being said, if Ver would have supported SW from the beginning we'd already have the scaling issue solved giving Core time to finish lightning, nimble wimble, etc.

Do a bigger buy monthly or quarterly and transfer them then.  Once ppl stop using btc for small purchases due to rising fees the blocks will clear up and fees will come down (maybe) then you can buy daily or weekly

I see your concern but there's nothing wrong with making profit.  There's a lot of investors who are counting on it... if I had the means I'd be one of em!  Have you seen the lineup at Blockstream?  Reads like a fuckin dream team dude.  If there was a Fantasy Dev league I know who I'd pick.  As far as them killing Bitcoin... it doesn't make much sense.  I'm more interested in learning about their financial roadmap... What their capital expenditures will be, operating income, net profit potential, intelectual property development, ipo outlook, etc.  Ya kind of come across like a conspiracy nut but the 12year old thing made it clear you're not one to listen to.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:26:33
In that case shouldn't others have their signaling count.  If so I'll start a node right now and signal SW.  It seems to me too that the majority are in favor except the miners which begs the question, were you guys under the impression it was going to pass and something changed for the miners along the way?  I know you can't speak for all devs, just looking for your personal experience on the matter.

The fees suck.  1st they attach a premium, approx. $5usd, then they charge 1.49% on top. 
My last purchase thru Coinbase was 2.15% over spot price. 
Find someone in your area that will take cash.  Local Bitcoin is good or go to a MeetUp if there's one close to you. Meet people who are willing to sell.  I met someone who mines ETH and sells me btc for 0.5% above spot.

I'd still like to know if the dev work was done w/o miner support.  My objective is to understand why they are, in your words, sabotaging.  Were you guys mislead into thinking you had majority support?  Was it that SW isn't what the miners expected?

Looks like 102 are active/planning, do you know enough to estimate the % of these groups of miners/wallets/etc and how that correlates to needed %.  My understanding is the only % that matters for implementation is miners and wallet adoption benefits end user is enough miners actually push this thru.  How far off base am I here?
Note: I've only been into btc for 1.5yrs and I'm not super tech so understanding the % or what % to pay attention to is out of my league.  I'm just learning as I go and HODLing :)

Meet in a public place with wifi like a coffee shop.  When he transfers the coins wait for confirmations and you should be good to go.  Many mobile apps have this feature like breadwallet, mycelium, etc.  how are you going to receive the coins?  App wallet, hardware wallet, exchange wallet?
If not:
Go to 
Enter the transaction # in the search and wait for confirmation that it's in the next block
Boom pow!  You got ur bitcoin. 
Good questions to ask:
-Make sure he's willing to wait around for confirmation.  This can take a while sometimes. 
-What network fee did he add to the transaction?  If you know about network fees you can judge the priority it has.

My buddy &amp; I have had long discussions about this and we think it's plausible but not likely.  
It makes sense that an AI could have figured out how to use all the available crypto tech to design something that worked but we would expect the outcome to be more developed in a shorter amount of time. The AI would have run the program millions of times to find a better solution. It would have caught the early bugs and worked them out. It would have produced something, from the beginning, that could handle the worlds transactions. Or not. These are just cliff notes of our discussions 
@_date: 2017-04-12 05:40:12

I've noticed a trend in the scaling debate that seems to directly affect the btc price (yes, I know a lot of different things affect price and I shouldn't single out 1 thing but it's too much fun thinking it.) Every time news comes out that's bad for Jihan/Ver (antbleed/BU nodes going down) the btc price goes up, when the news is good for Jihan/Ver the price trends down. I believe the vast majority are in favor of SW.

Charlie's analogy is easy to understand and seems plausible.  Unfortunately, SW is stalled out on LTC right now, seems it can't break the 75% threshold it needs even though it's darn close. UASF has gained momentum as a solution but I was hoping for quick implementation which is why I diversified awhile back. I'd like to see LTC &amp; BTC work together but with the crazy amount of side chains that'll be possible someone will create an even easier solution. That's my 2 cents. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:50:10
The ant bleed thing is definitely helping the price. Every time there's bad news for BU the price goes up
@_date: 2017-04-23 21:39:01
Bitfinex uses USDt to trade Bitcoin, not actual USD. Tether isn't worth $1usd right now so it takes more of it to buy a Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 04:59:21
I'm aware of the fee structure. What I'm wondering is what's the best merchant service that auto transfers to fiat as soon as payment is received and the tx time from payment to convert.  I saw a movie where Roger Ver talks to a grocery store about receiving btc payments that auto transfer to fiat.  
@_date: 2017-04-12 07:52:35
For the time being LTC has advantages like speed of tx and lower fees. All you can do is trade it tho. There's currently very little network effect
@_date: 2017-04-12 02:47:14
I hope Charlie can work some magic with BW, that'd be awesome to see SW on LTC and the innovation that follows. I don't want to wait around for UASF

I steer clear of fork discussions because I don't have enough knowledge to give an opinion. This sub is filled with qualified individuals and there's a ton of posts on the subject. What I do know is if you hold btc in a wallet that you hold the private keys to you'll end up with coins on both chains. I had ETH during the fork so I also have the same amount of ETC :)

@_date: 2017-05-04 23:39:35
I knew someone would take this too literal.  The real problem in Bitcoin is governance issues and a way for the whole community to be heard. If governance methods (not like DASH fucker) were in the protocol we'd already have a firm answer on SegWit or blocksize.  So imo our immediate problem of blockspace is small in comparison to the underlying issue which is goverance. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:57:19
That's a laundry list my friend. To many to list.  As for your purpose, it'll take years of learning before you understand the "why."  Ya might want to set the bar a little lower.  Start with the basics then move on from there. In a year or 2 you'll have enough knowledge to realize you don't know shit.  Most importantly... HODL.  I have friends that cashed out when the price went from $30 to $3.  Yep, he sold 300 coins for $900 bucks :( we laugh about it now but I can see an ulcer forming every time I bring it up.  Just buy, HODL and learn.

I like ur analysis. The prob I see with it is ppl are going from btc to usd or USDt, not banks transfers (to avoid tax implications.)  
To be clear, I think ur right about the timing. This is shaking out weak hands so they can set new long positions but I can see more downward pressure to $1,800.  Either way I'm solid cuz I'm in sub $700.  I HODL HARD regardless. 
There's so much stupid $ in this space right now. Ppl don't realize this is the Wild Wild West.  Welcome to Bitcoin Bitches!!!  Enjoy the ride if ur in for the long haul... if ur a short term'er beat it
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:50:49
Coinbase has the keys but they have an option to store them in their Bitcoin Vault which is more secure (note: takes 3 days to transfer from vault.) Personally, I like Electrum and BreadWallet for iOS but my fav is Tezor (cold storage, not on phone). Good luck OP, you're in for a wild ride!

Yep, fucked up on my verbiage. Thx for straightening that out
Edit: API is over my head
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:19:42
Tx = transaction. The weekends there's less traffic. My example is a good point. My fee was 6 cents!  But it came from a wallet with large tx so it didn't take a lot of data to mine. 
My understanding of how it works: Say you have a wallet that received 100, 1 cent inputs. Then you send a dollar from it, the mining process has to confirm all 100 input or UTXOs to verify that your wallet indeed has 1 dollar in it. I could be completely off base here but it's what I've come to understand over the last 3 years.

@_date: 2017-05-28 10:38:37
Doubled the coins, the value took awhile to come back. That's the same thing that'll happen if Bitcoin forks. You'll have coins on both chains as long as you hold the private keys where your coins are kept. There might be an exchange or 2 that'll honor the coin split but from what I've heard is most of em will only use 1 chain. So basically they'll sell off the other coin and keep the profit
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:05:42
I think they're missing a BIP or 2. No sure on exact deets. Remember reading something that explained the differences in code. It had to do with the algorithm and whatnot. There's got to be someone in this sub that can elaborate on the level of protocol implementation. I'm no coder. 
This isn't the article but it's a good read on the differences.

Some of the prices might be in Tether (USDt) which use to be pegged to the US dollar be has lost value recently so it takes more to buy a Bitcoin with it.  Poloniex is at $1605 and priced in USDt. 
This might explain some of the fluctuations or maybe the arb bots are broken hahaha
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:46:58
Have u checked the address you sent them from?  It may have been sent back.  I've heard after a certain amount of time it gets refunded.  Have u searched the tx on   Enter the tx # in the search to locate it. I've never heard of it taking this long.  Add the tx id # to your post or in a comment.

OP's question is about LN.  It's my understanding SW effectively double the block size so your calc's refer to on-chain txs, maybe consider doubling them. LN is a whole new ballgame. I've heard capacity estimates more than all major cc company txs/sec combine. I've also read once LN is fully functional with an optimal node network running it could handle million to billions of txs/sec but I'm no mathematician.  I don't know how many on-chain txs that capacity requires.

You should be able to locate the addy the deposit was suppose to go into. If you haven't used the deposit addy yet I think it comes up again on Bittrex. If that doesn't work for you I'd submit a support ticket and try to locate them on social media too. I once had a support ticket open at Polo for over a month and it wasn't until I mentioned it on Reddit that they saw it. It was dealt with in less than 3 minutes! My point is support is outsourced and they're all extremely busy so it helps to get their attention. Feel free to upvote me :)

Yes, there's a ton of stupid money in crypto right now. 
As far as being played... this is the Wild West homes, get use to it. It's also the way the world works, do u understand what the FED has done to the value of our precious USD? Do u understand how long the media has socially engineered our population? I knew the roller coaster I was getting onto and I've used it to my advantage. Every coin I buy/trade etc I've done research on and I've made more BTC by trading than I can afford with USD. Plus I've successfully forecast what the stupid $ will do. Trading BTC pairs is the easiest thing I've ever done.

The point is to hold the private keys (or seed as it's sometimes referred to) to your account. I prefer hardware wallets for the added security. Online wallets work fine too, I have a few but don't hold anything on them. Jaxx is buggy I'd steer clear of it. I've heard good things about electum but don't have it. I've used Breadwallet and Coinbase app, I like those.  If Nano is $80 I'd spring for the Trezor instead it's just a bit more and their PIN system is more secure.

Don't touch USDt my friend, use an exchange that uses your fiat. For me that's GDAX. Happy trading
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:55:15
I use to use Litecoin too.  No other options besides fiat from my prospective. That's the only reason I use GDAX, wish Polo or Bittrex offered fiat. 
I like your idea of have a metal pegged coin... get on it would ya, Hahahaha. Good luck!

Good luck to ya!  My offer still stands!  Your proposal has most of the $ going back to investor.  I can make you rich by giving you a % of my winnings. This is a win-win for you. You can help out the community by investing their Bitcoin and I'll pay you a % on your calls. I can make you rich by the middle of June!!!
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:39:29
But the ones deep in BTC have deep pockets now and when they dump others follow. There's no way I can afford the 1 btc I have. Imagine if I started collecting in 2010 and HODLed the whole time. How many coins would I have?  Could that amount affect market swings?  Probably :)
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:11:13
Also, GDAX just got ride of "limit orders" which fuckin blows!  You have to be logged on and place a sell order if you want to sell for lower than the going rate. 
Example: The current price is $1550 and I'm thinking the price might drop in a correction in the middle of the night and I want to lock in my profits.  On Poloniex I can place a limit sell order for $1500 so if a major downturn comes I won't wake with significant losses. You can't do this on GDAX anymore. 
The downside of limit orders: let's say a small correction happens and my sell order activates but the price spikes back up.  I've lost on those gains but I have the protection of locking in profits.  
Get educated in trading if you want to go that route or just use GDAX to buy and sell cheaper than Coinbase. 
Another consideration: if coinbase value is $1550 they sell your coin for you at a lower market rate to ensure the sale so your $1550 coin gets sold for say $1540 plus they tack on 1.5% so your true effective rate is approx 2.25% against Coinbases advertised market rate.  They do this with each buy as well. 
Good luck dude!

Read up on Litecoin. SW is coming soon. It's a close repica of Bitcoin except blocks get created 4x faster and 4x the total supply of coins will be mined. 
And I think they're running an older version of the Bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:56:25
I edited the post. I should have clarified fiat to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 02:41:46
Yep! It's called Decred
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:11:21
This guy told me trading BTC pairs was arbitrage or any other currency. I'm not into forex so I just took his word for it
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:47:22
Coinbase has an exchange called GDAX if you didn't know. Sign up for an account there. You can send str8 from ur bank and I think they have bigger limits than $50 but u have to go thru their KYC bullshit. Alternatively, go to Localbitcoins and find a local seller. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:09:23
I really doesn't make any fuckin sense that RV doesn't want SW.  The only thing I can think is his business was hurting from tx fees and he wanted an immediate solution.  SW not quick enough for him? Or Wu is paying him and/or he's retarded.

Well you just got an upvote from me brother. I agree, new users spew bullshit left and right. I was fortunate enough to work with the guy that introduced me to Bitcoin and I didn't buy until I had researched for a year and was confident in what I was buying. My guess is the noobs aren't as lucky as me and don't really understand what they're looking at or investing in. When I see posts that scream noob I want to puke. My hope is i can say something that will "ground" them as you put it. Not sure this post is reaching out to those in need of education but I hope some of them see it. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:32:15
AFAIK, Yes. You have to move them out of the vault b4 you can transfer anywhere else. It takes about 3 days to gain access to the coins tho so plan ahead. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 09:17:13
�� THIS
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:11:50
That's the downside of exchanges, you don't own your coins anymore you essentially give them to the exchange (in return for an IOU, for the benefit of trading) 
I've said it before but it's worth mentioning again. You only own the coin if you hold the private keys. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:20:06
Disclaimer: I'm not a tax specialist, do not take my advise as being correct, seek tax advisement from a qualified professional.  
USDt is a crypto pegged to usd so ur not in fiat. I highly suggest staying away from it tho. The company that created it has no obligation to pay you usd for it and the exchange that is the custodian of it has been experiencing problems. Use an exchange that trades in your fiat currency, for me that's GDAX.  I don't claim gains until I transfer to my bank because until then my $ is vulnerable and I could experience unexpected losses like an exchange hack.  I will only pay taxes on actual gains when I transfer back to my bank because those are locked in. I also have never transferred anything out because I see this as a growth industry and have a day job to pay the bills.  I'm in this long term, I'm what ppl refer to as a HODL'er. 
Something else you should be aware of: if you don't hold the private keys to your account you really don't own your crypto. All the coins on an exchange are held by them which creates a centralized location that's prone to attack. If your planning on holding long term store your coins in a hardware wallet like Trezor, KeepKey or Nano Ledger.  
As for the wire transfer I don't see any problems with that it's a good way to get in.  The cheapest way to buy is through an exchange.  I have a Coinbase account but I buy on their exchange GDAX because Coinbase charges 1.49%.  Good luck to ya and happy investing!

@_date: 2017-07-29 03:15:42
Most exchanges will still work internally, you can buy/sell btc pairs. You won't be able to deposit or withdrawal tho. To hedge I have some on my Trezor and some in an exchange account. That way no matter what happens I'll have options. :)
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:41:19
Maybe Coinbase
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:36:33
Destinia.com is the shit!!!  Super easy to use, flawless integration! 
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:08:34
Disagree, I got together with that bitch LTC at $3.83 and ETH at $12, and DCR at $14. They're waaaaay cooler now
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:28:56
Copy/paste the sent to addy into a block chain explorer. Verify the addy you entered is the right addy for Polo deposits. If that's the case you need to wait longer. Some exchanges wait for a ton of confirmations before they'll give you access and/or are freezing deposits/withdrawals especially being so close to Aug 1st. It's highly unlikely ur being fuct over. If you put the right address in you'll be fine
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:37:59
Agreed!  It's really cool!  Only downside from what I've seen is no btc option on the mobile app for iOS. Everything else is flawless my friend!  Thanks for the lead

@_date: 2017-06-08 15:56:12
1st of all, congrats on getting in and HODLing. I think you're making the right move. 2nd, for long term storage get a Trezor or another hardware wallet.  3rd, get you coins to a wallet that you hold the private keys to cuz if there's a split you'll get coin on both chains. I have both ETH &amp; etc bc that very reason. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:10:14

Amen brother!  Miner will have to shape up... they're service providers and that's it. What they do with the mining reward determines if they're an actual user or not. 
Correct me if I'm wrong: What's commonly referred to as "miner vote" is really the miners signaling that their software/hardware is ready to implement a protocol upgrade. My point is, come Aug 1st miners will fall inline or get replaced :)

I'm absolutely sure there's a market for this. If you're well educated, have linguistic skills and look sharp people tend to trust you more. I don't know what you look like but from the fb page and your comments you may be lacking the portrayal of trust, I don't know.  The marketing needs an overhaul.  Website? Easy to do business with?  Payments accepted?  Mission statement that stands out?
I hope you see this as constructive criticism. If I really wanted to buy Bitcoin and didn't want the hassle of doing it myself, I'd be hard pressed to give you $10k based on what I've seen. 
I love the concept though!  
P.S. posting your trading track record or show gains you've personally made would help. Good luck.

Tried them 1st, someone said btc just for hotel res. not sure tho. My experience wasn't good enough to keep me on the site.  Destinia.com on the other hand was completely painless, streamlined and very easy to do business with. Have you made a successful Bitcoin purchase through Expedia?
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:27:34

Hmmmm. Have u located the transaction on blockchain.info?
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:53:05
Have you checked out what Decred is doing?  They have some really cool stuff in the works where consensus is community based and give the collective a voice. In btc it's basically the devs and miners, up until the blocksize debate this worked pretty well.  UASF is a governance solution for btc because the community is overwhelmingly in favor of SW but 1 particular miner is blocking it and I believe this is the underlying issue, not the actual block congestion.  That's why I referred to PO's wait time as a small problem in the 1st place.  With Decred the proposals will get implemented or discarded rather quick and progress moves at a fast pace. I love btc and want to use it for the rest of my life but if something does change, like SW getting implemented, another coin could easily take its place... Litecoin for instance is almost an exact replica of btc but has 4x block capacity and on top of that it's getting SW.  They have the same potential governance issue but we might see a rise in network affect from them.

@_date: 2017-06-10 19:06:41
I've been HODLing long enough, at some point I need to take profit right!?!  Let's say you buy coin at current prices and by 2020 the price is up to $20,000+, would you be worried about booking a flight!?!  Probably not. And there's ppl that bought in at 100x less than me and ppl 100x less than them. My point is I understand where you're coming from but try to understand a point of view that's been around a while. Sometimes it's about having a little fun!!!  Enjoy the ride dude.

Ya. Why doesn't anyone talk about miner fees. If you look at the mining reward as a subsidy to miners and the fee as their revenue stream and add them together divided by the # of tx in that block you'll get to true cost of doing business right now. 
Block 470020
Mining reward 12.5btc  + Tx fees 1.789btc = 14.289btc / # of tx 1981 = 0.007213btc per tx
Current subsidy + fee = $20.72usd per fucking transaction at current GDAX pricing of $2,872.00
Luckily this subsidy will be around for 100 more years
