[Localbitcoins VEF-BTC](
It's pretty hefty.
Edit: The current exchange rate is 595m VEF for one BTC, there are a couple of deals for small amounts that seem "reasonable" &lt;100% markup. The normal exchange rate on localbitcoins seems to be a 2000% markup.

Of course but I am talking about the fork. There clearly are some people for the fork and other people against the fork.

I appreciate your response, except for the last part. I don't want anybody to shut up and I'm not taking any side in this, I'm not going to keep bitcoin of any variety during the fork.

I don't like how the 2X fork is happening but it's hard to take this article seriously.
It talks about the other side being an "attack" on bitcoin, complains about names of things "block size" vs "block weight", calls the other side clueless CEOs, says people can't have an opinion because they like ethereum, talks about his personal view of bitcoin hodling as if that has any relevance on what the population as a whole does.
If anything this sort of emotional drivel will drive people to see the 2X side as the more mature one, even if they don't say anything at all.
This sort of tribalism and refusal to approach the other side rationally will just create bigger divides in the community and create distrust in bitcoin.

To me it seems like both sides are irrational as they have decided that some minor technical change that won't mean anything either way long term is a hill worth dying for.
Irrespective of what side "wins" this battle it will be a phyrric victory for bitcoin as a whole. I think bitcoin will soldier on just fine though but if these kind of things keep happening in the future I think we will have to ask ourselves if maybe there is a fundamental  crowd psychology flaw in bitcoin.
I don't want to be all doom and gloom just yet though, hopefully this is all just a small speed bump that people will learn from and bitcoin will be stronger in the future.

I do think we should worry about what's going on, it's very bad for bitcoin to have forks that threaten to split significant chunks of the network, especially for a technological change that at least to me does not seem warrant two separate chains. 
As for trying to invalidate my opinion by painting me as an outsider, that's just ridiculous. I'm sure you agree that we should promote reasonable discussion here with anyone as long as it is kept civil.
edit: What makes you think I am not interested in learning more? The reason I read this subreddit is to learn. I'm not really sure what I could take with me from your post though. That I have to currently own bitcoin to be allowed to come here and learn about it? I have owned bitcoin before the fork and I intend to own it after the fork, I just don't want to deal with the uncertainty during it.

I'm not proposing anything, I just gave my opinion on what I am observing. 
Yes Satoshi did not intend for bitcoin to be forked randomly to some arbitrary weight, but that is what is happening right now and with bitcoin being decentralized there is nobody to petition about "what should be happening".
Bitcoin is based on decentralized consensus and a strong technical basis. We are seeing that being tested right now. I'm hopeful that the technological underpinning can grow stronger over time, the decentralized community aspect will probably always be a continual effort to uphold.

Couldn't the same be said for something like pets.com during the dotcom bubble? The internet was obviously a revolutionary technology and internet companies were seeing a constantly increasing value. The bubble wasn't about the internet being a fad, it was about some of the internet companies not working just because they were the first movers.
Blockchain technology might be the way of the future but specifically bitcoin as *the* currency might not.

Those are some good points about the internet!
I think there is a high likelyhood that we will see a lot of different things tried with blockchains in the near future and odds are that bitcoins will not be the ultimate implementation in the end. 
For most of us that will just be seen as technological progress but I'm sure there are a lot of very (literally) invested people who would not be very happy to see anything else take its place too.
@_date: 2017-09-27 14:51:46
But bitcoin is clearly not the only implementation of blockchain technology, while the internet is clearly the only public global computer network.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:18:05
I'd say Ethereum is a blockchain system that matters too today. But the point is that we can't be sure it will be the only one that matters in the future.
I'm not saying there is anything specifically wrong with bitcoin but then again I didn't see anything wrong with my flip up phone back before smartphones existed.

How exactly does goods produced increase by people stashing gold in their mattress?
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:05:17
What you are saying is essentially that it is a good thing if people get poorer because they will buy less unnecessary things?
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:40:46
And what "solid science" would that be?
