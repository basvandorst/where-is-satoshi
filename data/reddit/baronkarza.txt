This is good news to those that want to use a local service to buy/sell BTC in Texas.  It basically says that they will NOT be considered money transmitters.

I signed up for a solo 401K with broad financial:
Set up the trust account at wells fargo, then rolled over a few stray 401k's from previous employers. (I don't last long working for others on account of a low tolerance for bullshit, and do better working for myself.) After that I just set up a coinbase account and purchased through them using the trust checking account.  Message me if you want more details.  It's a pretty sweet deal.

I just mined my first complete BTC last week. I'm proud as can be!  I also set up a solo 401K so I could invest in BTC for my retirement tax free.  I now have a few in my investment trust as well.  Might grab a few more before the price fully recovers.

Yeah, so far so good on clevermining, but their profit margin has dropped from .01 to .007 per MHS per day.  Going to try Tom's Pool -  and see what it can do!

up to 0.99378072 BTC after my last clevermining payout...

Basically, what has happened has no bearing on the ability to buy and sell things with bitcoin. In fact, the tax treatment of bitcoin as an asset may be better than bitcoin as a currency thanks to the special case of capital gains.
The IRS made this ruling because companies are paying their employees in bitcoin (yes, people who work at some ups are choosing to be paid in digital currencies). If bitcoin is considered an asset, those people have to note the price of bitcoin at which they were paid and calculate the capital gains on that bitcoin. This is better than if bitcoin were taxed as ordinary income, because if bitcoin is held for more than a year the taxes paid will be significantly lower since the IRS taxes capital gains at a lower rate.
As for buying and selling things with bitcoin, this should have no bearing since the bitcoins being exchanged for goods would have an equal value to the goods that are being bought. While there are many ways to interpret "fair market value", since there is no central and single rate at which bitcoins are exchanged the easiest way to calculate "Fair market value" is the price of the object that was bought/sold.
Nothing significant has happened. This IRS ruling will have no effect on the bitcoin marketplace.

Yeah, the exact mention was actually a reference to a BITCOIN ATM!
