This exact comment was posted on a penny stock investor's forum as I lost $3500 in a scam . It wasn't the reason I didn't sell sooner but it was there. lol

If he cashed out his initial investment then he can't lose. Gains are only realized when they are in your pocket. IE potential money lost doesn't count. 
Backing your cash investment out of your holdings and riding profit shares or BTC is the smartest thing to do when investing in emerging volatile markets.

Catch that falling knife. lol 
Treat Bitcoin like a penny stock if you are in it for the money. Don't Buy. If you are in it gamble, I think this looks like a return to Pre-China prices if the Chinese can't find another deposit method. IMHO I expect it to stabilize $180-$190.

You are on the right track. China has publicly not made trading in Bitcoin illegal however the government pressuring banks to cut ties. If there is no Bank to exchange BTC to Yuan to BTC then there is no way to trade. Since no other exchange option has surfaced then people are getting out while they still can and crashing prices.

Here is Alex's last article on Bitcoin. He doesn't predict shit. He actually ponders what news will make the prices correct back above $800. 
"Bitcoin has fallen from over $1,200 since the Chinese news cycle broke. That’s a steep decline — about 30 percent — in a few days. The question now becomes what will bring upside back to Bitcoin?"
