They're super expensive but I guess they can be since it's risky accepting paypal for btc.

It shows you how volatile bitcoin is. It was around $14,300 - $14,750 range when I initially commented.

It's down like 5%. This isn't a dip it's just a sign of more selling then buying.

I just checked and it's 16800 USD / BTC right now compared to the market price of $14,600. Also, you have to commonly send in a picture of yourself and what not which is a hassle.

What sorry? Of course there is still people buying but it the price of bitcoin changes based of supply/demand. It just shows how there is an increase of supply (people selling) which is driving the price down. The opposite occurred after thanksgiving where there was a huge increase in demand (people buying) and the price sky rocketed.

It peaked at $19,500 but it didn't stay there long. I was referencing the $15,000-$16,000 range it's been holding.

Could be one after 10k. There was a dip after 5k when people sold off.

You picked the crappiest bank of them all for you example. You're also excluding new online banking and credit unions. In my opinion, you're going to see new adaption into using Bitcoin in non-developed / less developed areas and/or if a conflict arrises (such as South America, Africa, Asia and the area around Russia)
