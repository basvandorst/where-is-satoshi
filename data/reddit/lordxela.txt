This. This is what I don't get. Maybe I'm just clueless, but I now have double the money I had. Do I hodl this BCash? Do I drop it? People just keep acting butthurt.

What are you talking about? I donated all my Bitcoin to Venezuela. That's why I got it in the first place, of course.

The government.

What prevents Bitcoin from being copied, or the same coin being generated twice?
There is a network involved? Are there certain computers we can turn off to mess this whole thing up?

Does cold storage take an absurd amount of memory?

Why do transactions cost anything? Why can't you tell me your wallet address and I tell you mine and we're good? Provided we both created new wallets just for the purpose of this transaction.

I feel pretty bad, because I remember watching Bitcoin at $600 a few months ago. And I feel worse, because I remember seeing it at $300 a few years ago. I don't think Bitcoin is going to drop, so even if I only ever make $100 profit off of Bitcoin's entire existence, it'll be worth it.

How is sales' tax done with BC? Is it done at all?

One of my friends works at a credit union, so he considers himself a financial expert, and to his credit, (haha) he is. But when I mention that Bitcoin has the advantage of avoiding these kinds of shenanigans, he responds by asking if I actually think the US government will ever interfere in my financial affairs.
I honestly don't think they ever will, or that banks will unfairly freeze or take my money, but damn it must be nice to be that carefree.

I did something similar, but I'm jumping back in. I can still have confidence that I still have more money than I started with, unless the price plummets.
