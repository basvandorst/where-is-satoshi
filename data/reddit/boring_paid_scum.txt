Technically, the merchant's credit card agreements don't allow them to set minimums for using cards or add a surcharge. But I always keep some cash on me to be nice.
I really don't get why so many people here want bitcoin at point-of-sale. It's entirely unsuited for that use. No one wants to mess around with their phone and scan QR codes at checkout. (CurrentC is doomed for the same reason.) If your payment method takes more than ten seconds from "your total is" to "thank you," it's not going to catch on with retailers of any size these days.
The best outcome for bitcoin at POS is for someone to abstract the payment behind a swipe/EMV card or a one-tap NFC solution like ApplePay. And of course that removes most of the reason to use bitcoin in the first place.

What if -- and I'm just throwing out ideas here -- a bitcoin company sponsored a whole bowl game and named it after bitcoin instead of using their company name? Wouldn't that be crazy?

I don't get it. Why add those extra steps instead of just handing over some cash?

None of that is because of fiat -- if we were on a gold standard you'd still have to create, distribute, and manage physical currency. Also, the finance sector of the world is millions of times bigger than bitcoin. Probably billions or more if you include HFT. Somehow I doubt bitcoin would come out on top in terms of energy per transaction. Decentralization is expensive.

I have never paid for drinks with video games.
Unless the food bank accepts bitcoins, the friend is either buying them himself or going through a bunch of steps to convert to cash before he can donate it.
Assuming this actually happened and isn't a staircase-wit retelling, it sounds like benperrin was looking for any excuse to shoehorn bitcoin into the party at the expense of others.

What special permission is this? A quick search shows Moneygram, Moneypak, Ria, and a bunch of smaller services like Payoneer, Paysera, Xoom, and even smaller ones that specialize in pairs of countries.
