I can get behind that, but what "catch" will come along with it. If it doesn't effect it's use, why are they doing it in the first place.

No, I definitely do. I just think you have made the decision that if someone presents a fact or realism that doesn't agree with your worldview, they become dumb in your mind. Which is a form of rationalizing.

That comment hit me in the feels. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:56:20
I don’t think that’s true at all. Although, when pressed about religion he does do this. But if you watch/read more, it’s because he doesn’t exactly believe in god (as many people in the US do). But in every other argument I’ve never seen him do this, so unless you have links I think your just making shit up. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:41:55
Yeah while I understand where you are coming from, you are incorrect. You can say whatever you want, but if you slander or libel, you can be sued by the other side. It’s then up to a judge. His argument is deeper than what you suggest. All those reports were not speaking critically, they were straight up lying.

This comment. I’m gonna get it framed. Not for the reasons you think, I’m sure. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:44:38
You sound like an idiot.

Security now is a podcast about internet security. Their last episode they talked about bitcoin and Steve Gibson explained in this exact fashion how its near impossible to get the same address. Here is a link.

I probably shouldn't of said "will." I really really believe that it will crash like it did not too long ago. But, when I say crash, I mean it will be go down in value by a large percentage... but then it will work its way back up.
It seems like everyone in here is so sure that bitcoin will never falter again. I just can't believe that at all. People also are the most defensive in this sub than most others that I have seen.
I believe in bitcoin 100%, but it has a very long and difficult road ahead (at least I think so).

An investment is an investment is an investment. Commodity or stock, they somewhat behave the same.
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:58:46
True, but the saying is the same. Nothing is as good as it seams. It will fall, it is just a question of when. Doesn't mean it has to crash, but bitcoin will have its ups and downs.  Bitcoin has a rocky road ahead of it, but... I believe in it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:09:47
Look I agree with you, but we all have to accept that there will be huge ups and downs. I was trying to talk about upcoming crashes that would most likely happen and I was blasted with hate. People basically telling me that I didn't believe in bitcoin. Look, I get that you want this to work, bit blind  faith never ever works.

If people bought at that time, they didn't do their homework.

Calling them specifically corrupt is wrong. Most fortune 500 companies have corruption. Constantly bitching about one company just because you like android better than iOS. Fucking pathetic.
They all suck. But we keep buyen em. Consumerism at its finest.
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:52:33
And it crashed then as well. And no, I don't know "shit". Sounds like you don't either. I am not claiming to know anything. I think it will crash again. Stock - Commodity - whatever... this is a very very young technological thing... it is subject to rash changes.
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:56:55
As someone who has been part of the stock market for a long time.... Trust me... The crash is coming.
