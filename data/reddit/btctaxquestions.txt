I don't do this any more. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure act of 2009 basically killed this opportunity. Before the CARD act of 2009, there were tons of offers that were 0% balance transfer offers for 12 to 18 month terms and no balance transfer fees. After the CARD act of 2009, most offers have a transfer fee which killed the opportunity.

Hahaha. It's so interesting how different patterns come in and out of vogue. Cup and handle was all the rage for a while, then head and shoulders, now everything is a Bart. Just today, I learned about the Mr. Burns 137°.

Pretty much every major corporation is a study on how to build wealth through taking lots of loans.

You don't need to be a corporation to employ the same strategy. I found a nearly risk-free strategy that returned a lot more than the interest on loans. So, I took out the max that I could borrow. That strategy makes me more than my salary.
I've been taking loans out to make moneys for a very long time. Another example was when the market was flooded with 0% interest credit card deals. I built up 6 figures in card card debt at 0% interest. The credit card companies was basically giving us free money. I put that money into low risk vehicles and made 3% a year on it. $3000 per $100,000 a year adds up quickly for doing about a few hours a work a year.

I see why you are confused. When i said vehicles, I meant investment vehicles(stocks, bonds, loans, mutual funds,...).
I don't do this any more. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure act of 2009 basically killed this opportunity. I was definitely bummed since at that point I was making over $20k a year at it. Though, the act prevented a lot of people from being exploited.
Basically, here's how it worked:
1. Apply for a bunch of credit cards with 0% balance transfer on the same day. (It took up to 2 weeks for these lines of credits to show up on your credit report)
2. Once you got approved for the cards, initiate a balance transfer where they sent you a check.
3. Deposit check
4. Buy a mix of investments(I would normally do bonds and low risk mutual funds which consistently returned about 3%)
5. After year or however long the 0% balance transfer deal was for, sell the investments
6. Pay off credit cards
7. Wait two weeks
8. Go to step 1.

Has anyone try this seed yet? Might have some coins on it.

Or... People learned that you can't be taxed if you don't sell. Creating more hodlers.
