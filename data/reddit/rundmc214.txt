BCH icon then?
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:39:45
I understand the identity verification but not having instant access to something I pay for is not ok with me.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:24:43
Yeah, pizza, french fries. Haha

The ATM machine is owned/operated by "GetCoins" and it was located on Tate Street on the campus of The University of North Carolina at Greensboro. (In Greensboro, NC in case you didn't infer that from the name lol).

For sure. Can't wait until more people adopt crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:31:02
Yeah but if you factor in what they quoted the current BTC price at, the final fee was over 30 percent. Not the $2.50 just they initially stated. It was predatory is my point. I understand they aren't a charity and the machine is meant to make money for the owner but 30+ percent is messed up. Maybe read my original post again? Otherwise I'm not sure what your point is.
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:48:28
I'll def keep that in mind and 8% isn't terrible for those who require pseudonymous transactions.

Love it, however wish will sell literally any damn thing made in China. They don't give a f**k. There should be a sketchy shit from wish subreddit if it doesn't already exist.

I may have missed it, but it surely wasn't prominently displayed enough for me to catch (until after the transaction). I also wonde if the owner can inflate the current rate of BTC by certain percentages in the superuser setup menus. I'm sure there are plenty of adjustable settings for the purveyor to be fair or greedy AF depending on who programs it. It's only human nature I guess. If we can only write a digital contract for that, we could see some serious epochal change. ��
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:46:28
Yeah I'm definitely going to try this. It does usually work, just makes me mad.
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:43:52
Yeah I guess all in all I've made plenty on crypto. I killed it 2 years ago.
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:06:36
Thats prob an OG cypherpunk,  crypto God from back in the day with that kind of forethought.
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:03:10
So just to be crystal clear, those figures are millions right? I'd do my research but im not a troll with no life. 
@_date: 2019-09-16 02:37:35
Look inside the cartridge slot,  thats where your meth should be otherwise your gonna have to get a set of torx drivers and go inside to the motherboard.  Opsec is getting hardcore these days on the deepweb

But you cant SELL that pen for a grand.  People pay a dollar for it because we allbthe person who buys it agrees with the price.  Try to sell a pen on ebay for a $g my homie.
