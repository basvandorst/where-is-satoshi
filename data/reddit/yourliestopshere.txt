Goldman sacks ladled the greeks with hundreds of billions of dollars that the greeks did not owe in debt, then the banks took over many greek assets, now they have let the country be destroyed and they call it austerity.  All by a witch who takes her cues from the cycles of the moon.  This is not a joke.  Patently ridiculous.  The greeks need there own currency.  Bitcoin would be a great start, but an elastic currency would serve them best.

I know, I agree, I would prefer and the greek people should prefer a sound currency, but currently the heads in greece are doing some pretty silly things, so i doubt using someone elses currency could suit them better than one they control, even if it is elastic.

No fees, first international currency/money/cryptocurrency/capitalasset, depending on where you stand and who classifies it.  USA, its a capital asset, other places, currency.  Deflationary as this is a good thing, purchasing power increases.  Each bitcoin is divisible up to 100 million "satoshi's", the smallest unit.(.00000001)  Nicknamed after the creator, who ever he is, Satoshi Nakamoto, who put the paper out, the program out, a brilliant invention in math, and walked away.  His name is a pseudonym, as in not real, no one knows who he is, but a great gift I would say.  Its peer 2 peer electronic cash, as in you the user, can run the network (mining) and be rewarded for your participation in bitcoins, or use it as a payment method, and send your coin to whom ever you wish, almost instantly, across the world, very cool.

you have got to be the most uninformed of the intention of the bitcoin.  ITS INTENT is to be an ALTERNATIVE to fiat.  ONE LOSES VALUE OVER TIME, the other, bitcoin, will gain value.  One you can wipe your ass with, and the other is secure.  ITS A P2P Electronic Cash system.  for you and "ur family member" who blatantly doesnt know what he/she is doing. its intent is so "ur family" member doesnt have to do anything but let it be, STOP RUINING IT!  Well keep trying, I canat wait for the free coin thaat will be created by ur efforts.   Thanks.  AAlso the NY Exchange wont get my business unless it follows the protocol of the system.  No one wants anyone damaging its image, the media has done enough, as for regulation, go get utorrent and piratebay, or dont.

you need to type that as a reply to a tip comment.  Then you will be credited the dogecoin and a wallet will be created for you, the bot is a bit slow so the confirmation reply message will take a bit, the dogetipbot works very hard....  ;)
This should automatically register you, if nothing happens in a couple hrs, send a message to dogetipbot, subject register, +register as the comment to ensure registration.  If still no response because the tip expires  in 48 hrs, send another reddit message to dogetipbot, subject accept, +accept.
Again, by typing +accept in a reply to a tip comment, your wallet should be created and credited, but it takes about an hr or so.  In case you dont get the message reply that you accepted the doge, proceed to the later steps above.  Let me know how I can help, btw, i learned yesterday how to use the tip bot.

Money is time, place, value and many other sensitive contributing factors that go into REAL money or the medium for transfer.  The idea of a government employing Sound Money, a currency backed by something is a great start.  Fiat, (govt decreed money,) is just that.  You need to have price discovery, real money comes into existance in a natural way, in prisons, cigarettes are the means for exchange, years ago the native americans used sea shells, now people are using bitcoins an online safe currency.  The article starts off by saying "Think of each person as a production unit." "And I want one unit of productivity to equal one unit of someone else's productivity over time."  This is the antithesis to price discovery, because that same dollar is worth more to one person at any given time than to another as seen in the different prices of btc on many exchanges.  A million dollars is useless on an island by yourself whilst stranded, but 20 bucks is much more useful at a kfc whilst your saying, "I'll take the chicken".  The value of a currency, a free peoples currency, should have price discovery and that value should change often, and in the honeybadger's case, the algo assumes a deflationary position, which means one thing.  "To the moon Alice"  I mean no avenue for credit?...  The word extreme is a dead give away, thats what the bankers said to Ron Paul, your too extreme!!!  That doesnt work here on reddit, because you need to be semi knowledgabe to read and use a pc, once you hit that level knowledge, like a 10th grader, you can question your way to understanding.  Using google is important, and if that doesnt work use another or them all, or none, thats what will occur, freedom dictates these fluctuations.

Of Course they can suppress the price, Also they can currently buy all the btc they want and create a drought can't they?..  Your talking marketcap of 8 billion, thats like 1 day of what the fed spends, its silly priced this low, especially for int trade reasons and liquidity, this price will most likely need to rise if the boys in wall street and silicon valley have they're way, which they will.  MORE MONEY THAN YOU CAN BELIEVE WILL ENSURE THIS!  Making it a law to ban anything WILL ADVERSELY EFFECT my exchanges that don't even trade in Fiat junk bonds.  I promise if this happens I will only trade on p2p exchanges, and basically everyone else will.  You had your chances at mucking it up and YOU DESTROYED THE DOLLAR!  LET THEM DRIVE THE PRICE DOWN, you wont get price discovery, you will get a NEW BITCOIN, and It can be replaced like that, I would suppose Satoshi already thought of that.  Also that is fraud and those who engage in fraud just like MK will end up front page on redditSo let them try.  You guys act like price matters.  If it matters so much sell out now.

Solved - Offer the product for sale at a discount.  Oh, thats a good idea yourlies(me), but lets see if someone would guess that with a free mind, oh probably not.  (&lt;--- sarcasm)  Most prices are discounted if you buy in BTC, like free shipping and i think it was Overstock is giving a 1% discount if you use btc.  I think the company was Overstock.  Crappy products and products in general are already selling at a discount.  deflaation is not an issue with the btc protocol, a satoshi could be worth an infinite amount.  A little inflation is so dumb.

When you sell it into cash, then you pay a fee, so it is exchange side, das it! And I do mean you file the tax at the end of the year for the coins you sold, treat it as capital gains, at a lesser rate.   if you read Satoshi's pdf, you would know the answers to your questions.  
1. dude stop talking about taxing the miners, its ignorant.
2. anon trans are fine but you will have most of that on the exchange side anyway, but the coin will out pace you, so keep it the way it is.
The bankers had their go at it and so a magical japanese created a very well put response to ur fiat in lines of code, now its worth 7b and counting and by the most acute eyes, is a much more valuable medium for transfer.
Didnt the navy fund the tor browser so journalists could report back information from battlefields in countries with oppressive governments?  Why dont you like the navy?  Did you say fair tax? liek we all pay 1000 dollars a year, your you mean a fair tax where we pay 10% of each of our salaries, cause that isnt fair obviously because your taxing one person more than another.  Taxes were meant to be small so everyone would pay a fair share or tax, not a fair percentage or tax, or it would have been called the percentage tax.  DUH!

Okay, sorry for being fresh.  ;)
1.  Laws are essential with money, because I think its more about a way of thinking, a mode to convey that individuals thought, than it is used to "just" pay someone.  Bitcoin is not fiat unfortunately for the statists so the law with bitcoin IS the protocol, any other attempt is feeble and ill minded.  Try offering someone some satoshi's($20 dollars worth), an ounce of silver, or twenty bucks, I think you'd find some interesting conclusions.  In my life the silver ounce ALWAYS wins over 20 dollars.  Information N/A on the latter.
2.  Protect contract rights, deter fraud, punish crime!!!  Constitution maybe?  Bill of rights?  A couple other important amendments....  To say some jagoff is not going to attempt to stick his touthbrush up his bum bum is not logical, but as a means for payment, then yes, there will be a numbskull or two, but no where near the amount of rampant government abuses that should be put on the blockchain to avoid the transparency issue when they commit crimes.  Sure there are going to be criminals as well involved.  Hierarchical institutions are challenged by decentralization, if not blatantly inefficient and clumsy institutions as a system in the now, but they don't want an efficient market, it might interfere with an election or something, not on my watch they cower.
3.  DON'T TOUCH IT!!! DON'T DESTROY YOUR OWN FUTURE!!! Bitcoin is a technology not a currency, the first app "just" is, lol.  Like the main thing about the internet was the email app in the 90's.  The statement is simply irrelevant and suggest a massive misunderstanding of the innovation, at the least 30 years in the making.  He solved the double spend, and walked away, hey, maybe someone could offer him some sort of prize or recognition and he'll poof magically appear, "just" as he came...  But I bet not.
4.  It should be treated as the new "IT" thing!  Everyone and everyone should run with it, allowing for competetion for christs sake.  It blatanly is the best option of them all, but most are slow to catch on and by that time price won't be an issue, nor stability.  One of the fed chairs were quoted "the ATM was the last banking innovation"..  WE NEEEEEED COMPETITION!!!  That means you have to look at all the failed horrible, destructive, decemating REGULATIONS WITH YOUR LEGAL CODES AND ENFORCEMENTS, and allow the PRIVATE bankers to reassume risk!!!  You think it would be obvious right?  But sadly most are entrenched subsidized statists that are not independently wealthy, they rely solely on watching washington stumble and receive instant success's, then come on tv with an actor and explain without knowing how they have lasted for the last ten years at least.  Hamilton was wrong and central planning has failed world wide, don't you think?  The fed currently fights to keep purchasing power down, in the name of "fighting deflation" they clamor, could only really appeal to a numbskull.  Anyway, it should be incorporated as a choice, an option for a free human anywhere, thats the humanitarian thing to do and its what I would suppose a free American would do.  
Until you show some example of how Nafta and ttp are some sort of free trade zone than I would assume you would need alternate means for paying or interacting with the larger half of the world.  Hopefully this unlocks all the bad policies by allowing a free people to interact unmolested.  Sicking the IRS on the Taxed Enough Already (TEA) Party, was not the intellectually pertinent thing to do.  You happen to see any CD stores anymore?..  What about a blockbuster?...  Now how long will the others be able to compete with bitcoin the NETWORK?..  Plus the Fiat system is a finite one by design.  Sound money, gold as an example, stands the test of time.  Bitcoin is sound money and has extremely obvious benefits that are very long to list..  Hope this helps.  Again sorry if I am fresh but it seems as though bitcoin replaces your most recent accomplishments, but I am proud none the less.  Graduating from college is a grand accomplishment that merit should be noted, its what you do with your knowledge that sets each and everyone of us apart.  I like to read and regurgitate, how am I doing?  Don't hate me too much please, just aiming for a chuckle and a good read, with out sparing a bit of truth.

Bitcoin is a general ledger on the blockchain(the P2P group of computers that secure the network for operation) where only 21 million coins will ever be created. The blockchain is the mining, all of the computers mining attempt to solve a block, once one miner finds it, all the other people mining confirm that block and it gets added to the ledger on all the computers and goes on to work on the next block.  With bitcoin or math problems, they are very hard to figure out or calculate, but easy to check with a calculater, thats what mining does, hard to compute, easy to verify.  
So you want to start getting some bitcoins, 3 ways.  You can buy from a friend, buy from an exchange (coinbase.com) or mine it.  For mining there is only 1 type of gpu available on the market, AMD aka Radeon.  AMD is mining GPU's for alt coins, to mine bitcoin you need to buy ASIC's (application specific integrated circuit) which are more expensive, not out of reach, just more expensive, with a slightly less payout.  GPU mining is now being phased out a bit as the ASIC's are now starting to come out for the altcoins, or specifically for scrypt mining.  Most coins are S-Cryptography, or Scrypt, and bitcoin uses an encryption method called SHA-256.  The mining started on CPU's back in '09, then someone starting mining with their video cards because they were faster and now we are at ASIC's, chips designed to mine crypto and mine crypto only.  &lt;---  Now if you want to start understanding that, than by all means.  Or you could buy it, mining can be very tedious, settings and overclocking computers is quite time consuming and can be very difficult.  As per your questions:
1.  Yes
2.  Not printed money, but encrypted, decentralized, p2p electronic cash, that is created at a specified rate akin to that of mining for precious metals.  When you first arrive at a mine, there is a lot of gold, but as you mine the big veins your are left with a predictable diminishing return, this is how bitcoin works.  Every 4 years, the amount of coins in a block is cut in half, in 2009, every block had 50 bitcoins for whoever was mining it, now the block has 25, and in about 3 years there will be only 12.5 in a block.  Bitcoin is 10 minutes difficult, so If one person mines, it takes ten minutes to verify  the last ten minutes of transactions, and if many people mine it is still ten minutes difficult.  Remember, if one person is mining then they get the block reward and fees on the transactions every ten minutes as the block is solved and added to the chain and a new block is started.  But the truth is there is has not been one miner since Satoshi himself, so there are a lot of miners and a lot of professional miners who have big outfits making lots of coin, so you are sharing with all these people mining, the block reward and the transaction fees, and this is the incentive based model of bitcoin and the crypto currencies in general.  As coin price goes up, then there is no problem if the block rewards cut in half every 4 years.  Its not printed money, the mining secures the network and the miners are compensated with the block reward and transaction fees.
3.  Have to mine with a pool, unless you start a very large mining farm.
4.  The new ASIC's are probably not that hard to setup.
5.  Yep, A/C definitely and enough electricity to run it.
6.  Any pc will do fine.  Rasberry Pi is what most pro's use.
7.  Military Grade, actually the best in the world.  You know, until someone tries to crack it, but all the top computer techs say it can not be done.  There are some scenarios where bad things could happen to other crypto currencies, but most see bitcoin as too advanced due to the very large number of people mining.  The technology is called proof of work, the hard to compute or calculate and easy to verify, now there are other techs that have sprung up called proof of existence or proof of stake, which is a total other conversation.
8.  Hope not, let me know if i miss anything too.  Thanks
9.  EWwww, won't touch that one except, do your own research.
10.  Very risky, when you download the software wallet it says that the software is still experimental, so don't break the bank unless you can afford to or have balls of steal to bet big on a experimental form of monetary medium, where there is absolutely no one available to arbitrate, it's electronic cash, once you give it up, it is no longer yours.  p2p electronic cash that is experimental software, buyer beware!
Hope it helps!!! Feel free to ask anything.  Peace and dont forget to check out the other innovations crypto-currency communitites have to offer.

Magic, The Gatherings Online Exchange, MTGOX, is an online exchange where bitcoins were being traded.  Something became amiss and some coins were lost, stolen or misplaced(LOL).  Plus the guy doesnt talk to anyone publicly about whats going on like a normal company would.  Withdrawals, cash and coin went missing from the once largest exchange , and some speculate most recently running in a FRACTIONAL RESERVE MANNER LIKE OUR BANKS as he attempted to correct these losses.  The guy may be a crook or a bumbling idiot, or just a poor example of circumstance, ie Taking a shit on FIAT currency like real money is supposed to and gov's dont like that.  Show them a picture of him and his cat?!

Lol, okay!  I never said MK was a good guy, listen up, you still seem confused.  In our country, USA, you have to have evidence and it must be proven in a court of law before you defame, convict or HANG em, metaphorically speaking of course.
You still havent provided proof for your witch hunt that he was in fact involved in CRIMINAL behavior.
So blockchain evidence or go sit and spin.  ;)  KK pumpkin?
I dont know what your talking about looney this and that, follow the conversation...
The fact that YOU SAY he ran it illegally in another country DOES NOT HELP YOUR argument.  He may have been engaged in fraud but it was available to all and was open in the PUBLIC VIEW!!  THAT MEANS OPEN AND HOSTILE, IN YOUR FACE!  SO IF THEY WANT TO TAKE HIM DOWN AT ANY TIME THEY CAN!!!  YOU GET IT?

Well considering technology and moore's law, most schools I would assume can not keep up with innovations in their respective fields, simply put, by the time you get out your degree is basically worth less than the time you started your continued ed.  From a business purview, one with limited resources plagued by a horrendous behemoth style monetary policy that directly and adversely affects the poorest and most vulnerable among us, small business' feel the hit first.  My point about the degree is, what job does a lawyer acquire after they graduate and receive their degree?  Do you suppose all lawyers get a job and about what percentage of them even use their degree after schooling?  I am hoping the counterparty, smartcontract, proof of existance devs are hard at work to provide us with lawyerless contracts, broker less exchanges and really focus on scope looking forward rather than scale.  I couldn't be happier or sadder for you, as the job market is basically nil.

Dude, you addressed me and gave up.  Its really silly..
The worst thing you can do is call someone crazy, its dismissive.  Next time you try and talk at the adult table, read into what your talking about before hand.  I'm having trouble understanding why you call them a shadow bank?  Is an exchange a bank?  If it is, then I stand corrected.  So it took the good govt guys 5 years to stop a "Bank" engaged in fraud publicly out in the open, open and hostile, for all to see?....  Major investors engaged in this behavior?....  Seems odd, do you not think?
Why is it if this was so illegal did it take 5 years to find out about this?  
-edit: added last question
@_date: 2014-03-15 05:01:58
1.  If you get a small farm of mining going, say over 100mh/s, which will cost you over and around 50k, you can solo mine, most that i know still mine in a pool.  Just find a pool that is stable and has the vardiff strat servers..
2.  Equipment will pay back, it just takes  a long time, as difficulty rises your shares of each block decreases, thus less rewards (coin), so you will get paid back, question is when.  Its taking me about 14 weeks for full return on investment.  Also you can hasten this method by switching which coin you mine and if you sell them at their highs on an exchange, you could potentially buy back more later.  So it is worthwhile. 
3.  Which equipment to buy is up to you, also it depends if your talking about altcoin mining or btc mining.  You have to purchase expensive btc mining equipment to get into that game.  On the other hand, gpu mining altcoins is a great idea.

Going out on a trip to a plant is not proof of reserve, you either have the bitcoins for withdrawal or you dont, and your insolvent.  With Fiat, you can rework it, with bitcoin, your screwed if you mess up.  Proof of reserves is a subtle comfort and I would prefer it.  Proof of reserve on btc and fiat, but btc IS mandatory, and fiat attempts at POR are futile and laughable at best.  Keep it coming, prove me wrong.

If you read some of the acct rules, you would know, its a HUGE FUCKING JOKE.

Just spent 50 cents on a 40 dollar transaction.  Core has failed miserably.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:09:33
As far as I can tell, it's the protocol bribing the miners to follow core.  Transaction fees should be zilch, core is  really screwing the pooch, they fucked us.
@_date: 2017-03-17 01:29:05
The fees are way too high.  Core is essentially bribing miners.
@_date: 2014-03-26 08:20:35
no, its money.

They have failed and its obvious.  Avoiding the elephant in the room much?..  No need to act like an economist, they should not have steered the transaction fees.

Financial crimes need to be addressed, until you hang a banker or put them in jail, like lawless needs to be, you will have rampant disparities.  First Hillary, then Lawsky, then Bush, in that order.

@_date: 2015-08-12 06:47:05
Bitcoin is simply the best currency out there, the best!!!  There is a bit of a fungibility problem which can be cured with mixing, so pseudo anonymity is not a problem, essentially.  Also, a relevant price, i don't think matters.  Currently the price is too low in my opinion, but I do not see it staying where it is for long, it most likely will go lower before it goes much higher.  It hands down is a superior currency, but thats only the first app.  Wait until its super easy to do things with it, like fill up your car with gas, or recharge it.  What about crypto asset stock exchange, you will need bitcoin.  What about crypto asset hedgefund that all you need is bitcoin to control/benefit/profit from your btc, these things, the IOT, the Internet of Things, with dry up supply, and demand will force the price up.
@_date: 2015-08-01 16:41:33

There's a reason why people in their 30's aren't starting to have families yet in NY, only those who work for the state.  Most of my guy friends work for the state,  there's no other business in NY.  Almost everyone works for the state one way or another.  With Uber specifically, the second the state opens their mouth, they effect business, now with bitcoin, the only boon sector.  How fail they are.

And thats why he failed.  Great job, on not being elected, no representation from the people he served.  His license is a blatant example why his position should cease to exist.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:14:40
This is an excellent subreddit, but it is true, I would liked to have heard a bit more about the option to switch to XT, on the other hand I must say the mods have done an excellent job in being fair.  The downvoting is sad, especially late at night when there is not many people on, it basically seems extremely scammy.
@_date: 2015-08-13 23:58:09

The vote manipulation is obvious.  Most people in here do not understand the difference between tx and core specifically, nor does it matter.  But if you think complaining about it and posting the same old story for a year long will help, your kidding yourself and degrading this sub-reddit.  Democracy is for dumb fucks.  Don't be a dumb fuck.  Free speech means move somewhere else.  And the voting manipulation in the wee hours in the night here wreak like pathetic butt hurt.

check this article linked by drudge. [wsj.com/china pushes to rewrite rules of global internet]( 
It says this 
"SHANGHAI—As social media helped topple regimes in the Middle East and northern Africa, a senior colonel in the People’s Liberation Army publicly warned that an Internet dominated by the U.S. threatened to overthrow China’s Communist Party."  
When it clearly should say this 
"SHANGHAI—As governement controlled social media helped topple regimes in the Middle East and northern Africa, a senior colonel in the People’s Liberation Army publicly warned that an Internet dominated by the U.S. threatened to overthrow China’s Communist Party."
Start telling the truth wsj!  Its pathetic! 
Instead of demanding freedom of speech here on the internet like not censoring facebook and twitter you point at china, its hard to fail more.

Taxes are not stolen!  They do serve a purpose!  Income taxes though are akin to slavery, even still I am not against them to a lessor degree.  But to make arbitrary laws in favor of the rich, is not cool.  Its sad and pathetic.  The job of the state is to protect our rights, maximize liberties, not to cater to one group over another.  The federal gov't as well, the are purporting to create a more perfect union, yet the legal code is not legible.  Rand Paul is right, 14% flat tax, 1 page tax return, less failing from the state and the fed.  Also, dump ben lawsky into the free market, force him to compete on an even keel.  I mean, if you like freedom and that sort of thing.

Well it clearly is the best invention of our time.  Philanthropic is the best light for it, the fact that you subsidize poor people who own bitcoin by just buying one yourself.  If people in Africa own bitcoin and people in America buy the price up, they benefit.  I know its quite simple minded, but thats how I look at it.  Seriously though, there is no place in the world for monarchs or Oligarchs, or Democracies, ehem cough (England/U.S./France/Spain/Germany mostly), and the best way to bring power back to the people would be sound money.

It's the greatest money hands down, its programmable.  What I would like is an app that allows for escrow, payment scheduling, token channels (ie, iou's, multiwallet to hold all of my coins and debits/credits, essentially my own hyperledger on blockchain mostly, mostly.  Maybe even create my own coin/token basically to manage my online finances, an all in one so I won't need anyone else)  A cold storage wallet that I would send multiple coins to, not just btc. These types of innovations make the use case unable for legacy to compete.  Best way to brand?.. MAKE IT SEXY!!!  Cool, ahead of the curve, trendy, smart "cryptocurrency, financially savvy", make it a necessity for certain tasks, drug buying not one of them!!!!

Yes there are some nice places in NJ.
Yes I've had water in Jersey and it is horrible.  They drink bottled water, which is way worse.
And your last comment is laughable.  You think before a business offers their services, Chris Christy should sign off on it.  Unions are that of a soviet era, No?...

It is if you like living in the middle of no where, in a development where everyones house is the same, on a super small lot, at the lowest prices, with the lowest taxes, very low quality water, so yeah, really sought after.  A small part of it can be construed as beautiful.  Hey, ever drive there?  65 dollars in tolls round trip sound pleasant from anywhere in ny?..  Can you possibly tell me where all that money is going?  Also, isn't it illegal to charge a free person to travel?  We have paid for the roads already, so whats this ezpass scam?  This is grossly negligent in leadership and from a lawful pov.  Jail time please.  Start with Chris!

So this in fact tarnishes the new guys rep.   FUCK BEN LAWLESS, WHAT A FAILURE!
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:36:06
I wouldn't go there even if i knew the way.  The place is basically a dump, literally.  Also, Chris Christie is a disaster case for a free people.  Do you agree?

Can you please tell me how he is better than the previous governors, comparing him to John the swine is not what I'm looking for.  Can you tell me somethings that he has done to help out in such economically difficult times?
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:05:05
sounds like fedspeak, illusory language.

A positive step would be to make crypto legal currency like CA.

How does his cozy relationship with the limebags help btc?
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:52:54
we funded the nazi's and crushed europe for years!!  This is a huge misrepresentation.  Goldman sachs saddle these countries with debt, and in the vid it said germany was responsible with their money, lols, considering their current predicament.  This has to be the biggest boondoggle, the whole of the eu parliament were never elected and dont pay taxes, as they spend day and night finding ways to tax ordinary citizens.

And I do want to thank you for your participation in this conversation, it means a lot to me.

This couldn't possibly be more draconian aside from banning it.  How disastrous.
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:51:03
Verazanno or something has a 15 dollar toll, back and forth for Christmas break cost me 65 bucks from ny to nj.  The tolls are rediculous.  I know tolls are not a nj thing, but oil wells are a sight for sore eyes.  Seemingly uneducated, maybe.  NJ water SUCKS HUGE DONKEY BALLS.  Also there is no easy access to Philadelphia and NY, sitting in traffic til your back gives out is not a reasonable tradeoff for the "big city experience".

This is the sloppiest explanation/excuse/fairytale I have ever heard of.  What a joke.
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:58:13
grats on the math bro, did you take out the calculator?  I said from ny to nj, 65 bucks in tolls, no need to be mean.  It is simply a fact. *edit: its a return trip, not one way.

I understand your point, but I do not see how it helps.  Please explain the benefits of his bio, I understand what he's saying, although I do not see the benefits.  His first sentence means he knows about btc and blockchain tech, great.  The second sentence means nothing.  Third sentence, he's a lawyer, is that a benefit for bitcoin or blockchain tech?  Fourth sentence, hes a good lawyer.  Wheres the benefit of that to btc?  How does any of that help the technology?
