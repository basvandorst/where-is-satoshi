Really?  So the 416 million non-Apple, NFC enabled phones in circulation have NFC for *no reason*?
[Apple was campaigned against for their lack of NFC]( over 2 years ago.
But even if ApplePay truly is the only possible reason for a phone to have NFC, you still have to consider Apple's lack of forward compatibility... and intentionally omitting forward compatibility is a textbook case of planned obsolescence.

That would explain why they didn't introduce apple pay until now, which makes total sense.
But it doesn't explain why they didn't add NFC to generations of phones previous, which would make them capable of using apple pay once they did iron out the contracts, not to mention the myriad benefits of NFC for non-payment uses in the mean time.
Android phones have had NFC for years, it's not that large of an engineering challenge in general, and certainly not a challenge that a company like Apple couldn't have figured it out at least as early as handset manu's like HTC, Acer, Asus, LG, and Huawei.
No, the only reason to introduce NFC in the 6 and no earlier is [planned obsolescence](

ZTE managed to make a phone with NFC 7.0mm thick (nearly 10% thinner than the iPhone 5/5s).  In 2012.  Sony and Motorola also managed the same feat over a year ago.
Shoot, Apple put NFC in a *watch*.  You're telling me they couldn't manage to fit it in the iPhone 5?  If you believe Apple left NFC out of the iPhone 5/5s for technological reasons, you're delusional.

It's probably not... I agree that bitcoin derives a lot of value as a currency from the frictionless nature of a cash equivalent.
Just pointing out that Bitcoins can in fact be exchanged off chain.  In theory, you could have a physical currency based market with 'note' denominations etc. (a la Casascius coins) without actually involving the chain.

If you're talking about the "secure element", this is an industry standard feature of NFC, not some radical new design of Apple's...  Most phones with NFC have this same feature, including any phone with NFC enabled Google Wallet (which is pretty much, if not all Android phones with NFC).
In other words, nothing prevented Apple from putting NFC in a phone as early as the 4s that would be technologically compatible with the payment system in the 6/6+.


Not only is this not required for payments, but the 5s already has the fingerprint scanner... yet they specifically chose not to put NFC in the 5/5s.
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:58:47


Being the operative word.  Why did Apple *just* add NFC?  Because now they can obsolete 270 million phones.
A: Want to pay for stuff with your phone?  
C: Sure, that sounds cool.  
A: Great.  Now give us $800 and you can!
@_date: 2014-09-12 20:02:17
Oh, there you go, reason  for why Apple didn't put NFC in the iPhone 5/5s...
You know what you call that?  Waiting until a piece of technology is in popular use before supporting it in order to force your customers to buy new hardware so they can use the new feature... You know what that's called?  It's called **planned obsolescence**.
You know who's going to benefit most from Apple Pay?  The users of the 416 million **non-Apple phones** with NFC, because, unlike iPhone owners, *they won't have to buy a new phone to be able to pay with it*.  Because the manufactures of those phones thought ahead instead of designing their phones with the explicit purpose of forcing existing customers to buy new ones.  Think about that: Owners of the *4 year old* Nexus S benefit more from Apple Pay than iPhone 5/5s owners.  How can you *possibly* call that anything but planned obsolescence?
  
So which reason is it... Why did Apple wait until the end of 2014 to finally add an industry standard technology that's been in phones since before the iPhone existed?
1) They didn't have the retail payment deals until now  
2) It was just too damn much of a technologically challenge for Apple (until now)  
3) It isn't/wasn't useful  (until now)  
4) Nobody uses it  (until now)
Because I have refuted every single one of those reasons.
You know what?  Maybe, just... maybe the reason the iPhone 5s didn't have NFC was, \*gasp\*, planned obsolescence.

It does seem a bit disingenuous to make this statement immediately after starting to accept bitcoin (and in only one, albeit their main, country).  Either the market has been ready for a while and they didn't join it, or they think they're the only ones who picked the exact millisecond it matured enough to make a statement like that.
I think the exposure is great, but this particular tweet sounds like Dell is sticking their collective tongues out and saying "Nanny nanny boo-boo"
@_date: 2014-09-12 17:43:54
You're not getting it.
Apple introducing **Apple Pay** now makes total sense.
Apple waiting until the iPhone 6 **to *finally* implement NFC** does not.  NFC has been in every high end Android phone for over two years.  Yes, payments processors are just coming on board with NFC, but while one can use a 4 year old Nexus S for NFC payments, one *can't* use a barely year-old iPhone 5s.  Nothing explains that except for planned obsolescence.

From my understanding (at least in the US), it still has to be denominated in dollars, even if a different *method* of payment is specified.

As far as I'm aware, there hasn't been an independent audit of Lastpass's code... not in the same way as a large open source project.
KeePass's "Trust" page proposes the assumption that port/plugin developers would have discovered errors or malicious code in KeePass's codebase.  IMHO, you could ask the same question of it.  Did you download binaries, or did you compile the code from source yourself?  Ultimately, you're trusting the code's authors there as well.


I did not know this, but that is cool.  I'll have to research this a bit further.
Just to be clear, I don't have anything against KeePass.  I'd have no qualms about using it myself.  **IMHO, anyone who doesn't have an eidetic memory should use some kind of password manager**

While I agree with you, 16 characters still allows you to use strong passwords... Something like "OYeX%z9XOP8$X7iQ" has a search space of 95^16 (which is equivalent to 105 bits).
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:43:03
That gives a search space of (2^1 * 64^7 )+(2^1 * 64^6 ) or 8,933,531,975,680 total possible passwords.  [This rig]( could brute force every NTLM password in that search space in 27 seconds.

Thanks for the lengthy response!
So the motivation was purely economics?  Or was self-reliance part of that thought-process?  Was the array/battery bank professionally installed, or DIY?  Are you using inverters, or does everything run off DC?  w/ 3.5kw, I assume you're using fuel (propane?) for heat and cooking?  I assume your farm implements are still fuel as well?  No A/C in NH?  How often do you use the generator?  What does your electricity consumption look like (CFLs/LEDs, laptops, farm eq, etc.)?  Do you have a clothes dryer?
Off-the-grid seems like a great way to go given adequate solutions to the first-world problems it can pose.  At the very least it's a fascinating engineering challenge.

KeePass is available on *one* platform.  There are unofficial ports for other platforms, but unless you're going to audit the code for every one you intend on using, you're not really gaining any security over LastPass's well trusted codebase.  As far as I can tell, there aren't any open source iOS ports, so if you're going to use it on that platform, you're actually much worse off.  LastPass also supports two factor authentication (multiple types), syncs between devices automatically, has very good browser and mobile device integration, has official clients/plugins for 'a shitload' of platforms, and is generally much easier to use.
Open source is great and all, but "Keepass2Android" isn't TrueCrypt... it's not going to get the same kind of code audit/independent verification.

I don't disagree with your statement, but it is a counterpoint to bitcoins "failing as a currency".  As a vendor, accepting only bitcoins without USD/fiat pricing (which postalrat is implying) is simply not feasible or even legal the vast majority of the time.
