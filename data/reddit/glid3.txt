I apologise for my ignorance but, what use is splitting the total sum? I understand that having multiple accounts is safer if you are holding a lot of bitcoin, but it  wouldn't make it any harder to track would it?

That's the most ignorant and informed comment I have read all week. "Until you lose." lose what, when and how much...

I hope your shorting then :)

Interesting. However isn't there an issue with this. With your given example of rabbits mating wouldn't the current situation be like lots of sex and a stagnation in birthrate?
I'm sure you can appreciate my incredibly accurate 50 day moving average indicated by the baby blue line.
My point is the hashrate increase makes sense or *can be rationalized* but it doesn't seen to coincide with the other half, the price.
I do know the bitcoin is potentially being suppressed however I feel this is slightly beside the pint.

In essence I am questioning the validity of bitcoin as an investment. It is much easier for a micro (troll) currency like dogecoin to increase in value by 50 fold than bitcoin and the argument that its only a matter of time till people get to know about bitcoin is somewhat of a non-argument as this publicity will shine a light on the entire system. (Other coins have better fundamentals)
Sorry if its a re-post, simply wanted to know what people thought in a little more detail.

Fools and their bitcoin are easily parted

It's ironic how we believe in a free society in almost a anarchic manner and yet when your daughter gets raped we scream "gov't help me" put him in prison to keep our children safe.
this is down right sickening.
the rape was wrong but so are the people who want laws to govern a free society.
this is freedom.

New to this, am afraid my sarcasm detector has not yet been synced with the natives.

Sorry for my ignorance but, how can you lose coins in cold storage
@_date: 2014-03-08 10:53:37
To costumers?
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:25:13
Odd. no one replys to that. Potentially Billions of anonymous dollars at your finger tips? How fast can you say problem.
@_date: 2014-02-20 09:13:40
That sounds a little apocalyptic

Glad there is some sanity out there! I shall see you again amongst the sea potential delusion ;o

You can make a meta wallet, over watch, over lord our whatever you want to call it wallet. Where you can watch the assets and transactions of multiple wallets within a single one. Theoretically all it would take would be to glance at the cold storage wallet once a day and make sure there were no outgoings. Is this a simplification?
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:22:14
And then get tortured for the keys
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:59:14
Could you please explain
