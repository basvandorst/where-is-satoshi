Shermy mentioned pajamas.


That's good advice. I've given to WikiLeaks before, but maybe it's time to give a bit more. They really have had a very positive impact on the world and I hope they continue to do so.


Good luck with that. Max Plank's quote is probably more realistic: "Science progresses one funeral at a time." I have no problem with older people being pro-bitcoin, and it shows a certain openness many older people don't have. But let's be real. Brad Sherman will never accept the rise of cryptocurrency, but he is mortal.


Bitcoin is for people who want financial sovereignty. That's a very small number of people.

In case Shermy drops by, I'd like him to know he's partly right about bitcoiners. In my case, I can confirm that I am sitting here in front of my computer in my pajamas. It's quite comfortable. I'm not telling my wife about how I'm going to be a millionaire though. First, I don't have a wife. Second, bitcoin already made me a millionaire. And I'm not the only one. And Shermy and his kind playing make-believe with their fiat are only going to make more and more people millionaires, if only because more and more people will realize the trash Shermy and his friends push as "money" has no value. Thank you for your "service," Shermy!
I wonder if Shermy is comfortable wearing that suit. Sad to be that old and have to play dress up like that.
