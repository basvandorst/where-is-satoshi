It might have the most potential, but it hasn't actually done anything yet.
The most recent freakonomics episode has Al roth, the 2012 winner who as a part of his contributions to economics has helped save 100s of lives. It has actually done something.
Bitcoin might do something significant, but hasn't yet.

It's not really schadenfreude though is it? 
YOu're not happy about their misfortune. YOu're happy that their misfortune is literally your fortune.

But really, if there was a rule to follow on reddit it might be "if the commenter is supremely confident, then they're probably talking out of their ass". Or at least doing so because it benefits them (financially in this case).

Bank loans have pretty low interest because the interest rate at the fed is like 1.25%
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:30:03
Morgages loans are also extremely low.
All interest payments are linked.

it might. it might not though. 
And actually to be a bit more accurate, demand needs to go up a bit for the price to stay the same. 
What might also happen is another currency might take its place.

if demand stays the same

Where the hell are you banking?
I deposit all my checks from my house with an app.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:36:47
seriously. I don't know of a single person that has a security lock box. Let alone one that has had the contents stolen.

I think it also has to do with your region and overall wealth of the area. 
I live in a middle class area in NC. Our post offices are pretty damn big and there's never a line of more than 5 people and it rarely takes more then 10 min. 
Yes, longer wait times happen during the holidays, but that makes sense. The demand surges.

okay but why?
THey're providing you a service in which money from someone across the world is given to you safely. They just want to check the validity of it because foreign checks are more likely to be fraud. 
There's way more things to be mad at banks for. Don't get mad when they provide a legitimate service. Or ask your grandma in EUrope to pay you in bitcoin and never get anything.

The benefit of gold is that it has material value and therefore has a floor. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:51:01
No, it's actually very convenient. You open the app and basically take a picture of the front and back. Make sure the number is correct and it gets submitted. 
They do ask you to hold on to the check to make sure that it's correct. But i've never had one be sent back. ANd my GF has awful handwriting so they've seen it all.

Gold's material value for manufacturing is the absolute floor.
but it also has value from being pretty.

That's why credit card companies guarantee that the transaction is correct though. If there's weird transactions on my CC i get notified. If i lose my CC and someone makes a purchase i'm not liable for it. 
So while you're correct, there is safeguards in play to stop that from happening.
