How is it trolling?

lol they've been saying this since the great depression, I see no indications of that happening soon.

For me, it's the communities. People who like bitcoin seem almost cultish and unrealistic with their ideas. People who like dogecoin treat it like a joke and are way more fun. I'm sure that's because bitcoins are way more expensive, but both seem like a joke to me regardless.

The price of mining is too ridiculously high now, which it wasn't in the past. People are losing tens of thousands of dollars compared to hundreds.

Have you watched the Daily Show before, because most of his jokes make good points.

Mining costs are way, way to high now if the price is this low.

Gold as a raw material, has a lot of manufacturing uses, and has intrinsic value. Bitcoins do not.

Sorry I'm in way over my head here. I honestly feel like an idiot and I am just now trying to uninstall everything I just installed.
This may sound extremely dumb, but how would I go into the directory to type make uninstall.
Thanks and sorry for the dumb questions I honestly don't know what I was thinking trying to do this.

Yes I did use homebrew, and I believe I just fixed it by uninstalling homebrew.
