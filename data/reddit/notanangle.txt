noob here...what is this?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:55:00
how much is it, right now I got 500$ to invest in crypto (sort of big deal for me) but  I cannot get to it I am getting ridiculously high purchase rates :( 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:33:43
deal, I am a Nigerian prince so that is not at all a problem do you accept payment in cows and goat worth more than $90000000

They are massive ripoff.

OMG! THAT WOULD BE AMAZING!!! Do you have pay-pal? i could do that or another and do multiple small transactions to be safe? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:56:45
yeap I realised it, any other place to buy bitcoin other than coin base they have ridiculous prices too.

Oh thats just a snap of some other guys post who was victim too, I found it on google to confirm my suspicion. 
but in all honesty, I just want ppl to be aware of doing paypal transactions.

how generous of you 
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:46:06
Where will you buy it from? you will be paying nasty amount of fees per transaction on almost all bitcoin exchange websites.
