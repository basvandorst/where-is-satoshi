It is us vs them, bitcoin is war
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:23:12
You don't have to be hostile to random people on the internet sure, but this isn't my little pony adventures. Bitcoin by its very nature is explicitly about people fighting for resources. The space itself is rife with scammers and they are all trying to take your money, and your mum's money. There are armies of altcoin developers working overtime, doing everything they can to take bitcoin's crown. The currency itself is only useful in conflict scenarios, where censorship resistance is important. Everything about bitcoin is war.

Depends on whether the reason for the crash was good or bad for bitcoin

There was a run up in the week / two before the ETF announcement, and then that speculation retraced. More or less a non-event.

Bitcoin is just digital cash. So the government would tax in the same way they tax people who mostly use cash day to day. The whole system won't change because people use bitcoin. I think you may be looking for for a community looking for a tax free world.
