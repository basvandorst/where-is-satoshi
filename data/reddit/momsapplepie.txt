Have been trying to verify a CC with Coinbase for weeks.  Still getting "Error2: Address did not match"
Have tried all sorts of variations of my address.  Tried 3 different cards and am looking directly at the statements for the address.  Even called the bank to verify address.
No luck.  Emailed support a number of times without response.
Anyone have any tips on how to get my CC verified?

yes, it does.  thanks again.

Yah.. I tried just now to add a CC.  I get "Error2: Address did not match"
Not sure what that means.  I buy a ton of shit every day with my credit cards and have to enter the address on many purchases.  Tried two different cards just now - no go.
Moreover,  I have verified my identity so even more frustrating (they know so really obscure info about me to verify my identity but can't even verify a stupid CC).
I guess we all have to hang in there until they figure their shit out.

Funny as fook!

Thanks for the explanation.   So... I don't remember seeing this "acknowledge future prices, etc." the other night when I bought.  Does that mean Coinbase will honor the price at that time when the ACH xfer clears?

Thanks.  I tried ave and avenue.  No luck on either.  Thanks for the suggestion about calling my bank - will give it a try tomorrow.

yah.. i've been trying to verify a CC for the last three days.  coinbase keeps saying that the address is invalid yet it is the registered address for the account and i tried it with three different CC.
there were even a couple times when i received some strange erorr (random computer code on a white screen).  they are def experiencing some growing pains.
