No because people will think they can buy a milli Bitcoin. Which they could but it'll cost 2 milli Bitcoin in fees to buy that 1 milli Bitcoin. 
This is where Dogecoin comes in ;)  I moved £8000 worth of Doge for a fee of 1 Doge (0.02¢) in about 2 mins

Not before I do!!!! Don't be put off by the rain

I know I shouldn't but it made me chuckle

but the Dogecoin mining network hashrate is shared better than the Bitcoin mining network hashrate

It is nice to get away for a few days without having to receive emails all the time. I did last week in Paris for 3 days....bliss!

not too far wrong....

Why are you on here posting that?
@_date: 2014-03-18 13:03:56
but people are using Bitcoins for 'personal' use at present. It's hard enough finding people who use Bitcoins in the UK - but even harder to find ones who own their own company too!
Wouldn't it be beneficial to offer a residential package?

He's doing this while everyone is talking about Satoshi in the news

Yup every stand I've seen seems to be Bitcoin + Dogecoin.

Why does Bitcoin need a 'foundation'? Surely it goes against its 'decentralized' nature?

ii) please make it more obvious that you can only link US bank accounts (I hope you can do UK bank accounts soon!).
iii) I deposited a nice round 1 BTC, was charged $11 or so fees (which I understand) and that was added to my total cost charged to my card, but my balance is showing 0.9948.... Why is this?
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:22:32
do you even think before you type!? of course it can!

How does he control 51% of the bitcoin mining power?

Wouldn't it make more sense to have the email send a link to confirm the transaction within 24 hours instead of having 24 hours to cancel? What happens if I don't have access to my emails and my PC was hacked?

The sign-up questions are very US-related. Try make them more international e.g. less of the 'Third Grade' or 'Sixth Grade' etc

Yep, that's the youth of today. I think we have a bright future ahead 
Wasn't there a thread last week where a teacher asked her class about Bitcoin and 90% had heard of it. Not even 1% of people at my work have heard of it
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:30:17
yep - Scan.co.uk accept bitcoin
