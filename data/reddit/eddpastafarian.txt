Due to American KYC/AML regulations, I doubt any exchange would allow you to withdraw to a third party account. Your best option is to have your supplier open an account with their preferred exchange and immediately convert incoming BTC to their local currency to limit volatility exposure. The hard part will be convincing them this is a better alternative to the current setup, especially with the recent Bitfinex hack.

I don't buy or sell bitcoins often, but when I do the transaction invariably ends up in a block that takes much longer than normal. I usually don't mind but when the buyer is new to cryptocurrencies, more often than not, I've just finished explaining that it's safe to assume the transaction is good as long as it shows up on the network but you can wait for at least one confirmation just to be sure. :/
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:56:27
There is no easy answer. Until your suppliers are willing to accept bitcoins as payment and assume the responsibility for exchanging them for other goods and services, it will be easier to continue as you currently are.

The blockchain is a public record of the location of every bitcoin ever created and all the stops it has made along the way. The "address" of each bitcoin is the public version of a public/private key pair. Changes to the record can only be made when one has access to the "private key." These keys are very long and impossible to guess.
To send a bitcoin from one home to another, the owner basically makes an entry into the blockchain stating that control of the bitcoin is moving from one public/private key pair to another. Once the bitcoin is assigned a new public/private key pair, only the new key pair is recognized by the network as the legitimate owner of the bitcoin.
Edit: minor clarification

Let me see if I've got this straight: You're looking for an app that creates a temporary multi-sig bitcoin wallet?  seems to be working on it.
An easier solution is just to have the house generate a new address on an existing wallet app like Mycelium, as long as the house can be trusted. I believe Mycelium is also working on integrating multisig capabilities so even if you don't want to trust the house, it might be better to wait for them instead of starting from scratch.

Bitcoin is just like any other currency in that most people earn it, trade goods or services or other currencies for it, or have others give it to them.
The term "online wallet" sometimes refers to a third party that accepts your bitcoins and promises to let you withdraw them upon request. Some services like blockchain.info actually allow you to access their website in an encrypted manner to generate your own wallet and store the keys, also in an encrypted manner. Again, there is some trust required, as seen with the very recent loss of BTC due to vulnerable addresses being generated: 
"Offline wallets" usually refers to keys stored somewhere inaccessible via the internet. Spending BTC stored offline typically requires transferring them to a wallet that is connected to the internet.

I bought my first bitcoins for a dollar each back in early 2011 but they weren't an investment, I spent them almost as fast as I bought them. After starting BitBrew, I've purchased very few, instead focusing on different projects that contribute to the cryptocurrency economy as well as earning BTC. As a result, I've had thousands of bitcoins pass through my wallets over the years but only a handful tucked away for the future.
Would I have saved a few more if I knew then what I know now? Sure. Do I have any regrets? None whatsoever.

Some would have questions, others wouldn't.

Bitcoin is a tool so how you "get started" will depend on what your intentions are and how tech savvy you are.
Just investing for the future? Go cold wallet. (Don't forget to back it up. Remember, you are now 100% responsible for your own money.)
Plan to day trade? Open accounts at reputable exchanges. (Do your due diligence. Once you transfer bitcoins to an online service, you no longer have control over them, just a promise from the exchange.)
Want to purchase goods or services? Choose the wallet option that best suits your needs regarding convenience versus security.

The other addresses are change addresses. If they were sent to an exchange or some other site that controlled your bitcoins but created an "account" for you, the BTC wouldn't have sat at the first address. They would have been swept to the site's wallet. The fact that such a significant sum hasn't moved implies the original receiver hasn't voluntarily relinquished control.

I am by no means an expert in this area but I did run a small business for ten years and believe I have a pretty good handle on this. If your company uses a third party processor like BitPay or Coinbase, their role should be spelled out in detail in any arrangement between them and would probably put them as the merchant of record. Bitcoin allows you to eliminate this middleman, however, which is what I've done. Consequently, I am the merchant of record in my Bitcoin transactions since I process the payments myself.

Here's a slightly better analogy (IMHO): you find an envelope ready to be mailed, addressed, stamped, etc, and it has come unsealed, revealing some cash inside. I wouldn't be surprised if reactions ran a spectrum. Some may keep the cash, some may seal the envelope properly and mail it, some may return it in person hoping for a reward, some may even take their own "finder's fee" out before returning it. Personally, I like to think I'd do the honorable thing.

Ahh, so it *could* have been sent to some type of cold storage.
If so, that unfortunately increases the number of possibilities to consider.
Edit: If you have this transaction recorded in your LocalBitcoins account, then a lot of the questions you ask don't make sense. You couldn't possibly have imported them using a private key because the only option LocalBitcoins offers is a simple withdrawal and they haven't moved from wherever it is you withdrew them to.
You mention more than once that you "believe" you made this transaction but there shouldn't be any doubt unless you think your LocalBitcoins account was hacked.

I see, this would be more of a "organize your home game more effectively and transparently" app than a "create a multisig address" app.
I'm beginning to see a lot more potential. The app could handle a lot of the math, like determining how much each chip should be worth in BTC and how much should be deducted for miners' fees. I wonder how difficult it would be to incorporate the ability to generate new addresses for the same wallet to accommodate players who join later or choose to buy more chips.

If you are registered and a secular, non-political organization that hasn't previously accepted Bitcoin donations, Bitcoin100.org would be happy to send you $1000 worth of BTC once you have a Bitcoin donation option posted on your website.
I see some posters are recommending payment processors over static BTC addresses and vice versa but this really depends on how you plan to utilize the bitcoins you receive. If you will need to immediately convert some or all of them into USD in order to operate (and most NPOs do), a payment processor is the way to go. The most popular payment processors are currently waiving their fees for charities.
I don't believe any reputable payment processor is handling other cryptocurrencies at the moment. Your best option for those would be to post the static LTC or Dogecoin address and then exchange them for BTC, which means you would need to set up wallets for them, as well.

As others have said, most of the time it isn't even necessary to wait for one confirmation as long as you can verify the tx has been broadcast and the appropriate miners' fee is included.
What you have to ask yourself is, "Is it worth the time, effort and resources for someone to commit a double spend for this item?" Maybe someday someone will do the math and determine how much it would cost monetarily to perpetrate a double spend after one confirmation but I'd say your safe assuming it would be AT LEAST as difficult as breaking into a bank vault.

I like this idea. Manufacturers would, in essence, become miners of their own coins (I see an alt or sidechain as the optimal way to take advantage of this). Each coin represents one unit of their product and is generated right before packaging (hmmm, need to work on Proof of Production model). Receiving merchants would necessarily have to install "wallets" (PoS/inventory software) compatible with the manufacturers coin. Instead of the merchant scanning bar codes and adding them to his store's inventory, the manufacturer would send a "metacode" along with the physical merchandise. After scanning the metacode, the manufacturer knows it's been received and the merchant's system is updated with all the information contained within it (coins are added to his wallet). If there is some loss in shipping, the merchant (or his employees) can then update the blockchain with the new info resulting in the coins being sent to a black hole. (Proof of Loss necessary? I wonder how businesses handle this now.)

Can you be more specific?
The initial method of determining the value of a bitcoin, back in the days when only a handful of early adopters were generating thousands a day, someone calculated how much electricity was consumed by the hardware used to solve each block and this was the first widely (relatively speaking) accepted basis of attributing value that ad hoc exchanges used.

There are a few reasons I use Bitcoin:
1) It's completely transparent. No other entity - no bank, no company, no government - can corrupt it without leaving very obvious signs and the network would probably bounce right back, in any case.
2) Bitcoin provides me with the option of exercising complete control over how I receive, store and spend it. I can use a third party service to help with the tricky things, or I can spend a little time and effort to learn how to do them myself.
3) The technology that allows this decentralized, peer-to-peer network to flourish has so many possible applications that were practically inconceivable before...it truly is mind-boggling.

If something comes along that is so much better that Bitcoin hodlers abandon their holdings, it would only make sense to incorporate those improvements into Bitcoin. In addition, even just a few users would prevent a slide all the way to $0.00, so it may become the new litecoin to some future cryptocurrency, but I highly doubt it would disappear.

Sweeping means moving bitcoins from one address outside of your wallet to one that **is** in your wallet.

If you import a private key that belonged to someone else, you run the risk of them moving the bitcoins later without your permission.

How much time will you have? Are they primarily interested in "investing" or do you think some of them might actually use cryptocurrencies to buy/sell goods and/or services?
Focus on answering the questions you think your audience will have. Analogies can be useful but they also sometimes confuse people so choose yours carefully.
Here are a few FAQs I've gotten over the years.
Q: Who created Bitcoin? Can't he manipulate/control/create bitcoins since he wrote the code?
A: At its core, Bitcoin is just math. Satoshi was the first to write a program that utilizes a peer-to-peer network secured by strong cryptography to store a shared ledger but he did not change how math works to do it. He can no more change the fundamentals of Bitcoin than Pythagoras can change triangles.
Q: What if someone hacks Bitcoin?
A: The cryptography that protects the network is currently unbreakable. It's exponentially easier for a hacker to break into every bank simultaneously than to "hack" into Bitcoin. Your passwords and keys that give you control of your own bitcoins, however, are only as safe as *you* make them.
Q: What if the government makes Bitcoin illegal?
A: The US government has tacitly endorsed Bitcoin by auctioning off those seized from illegal activities. If they were considered contraband, they would have just destroyed them. Governments worldwide are only now trying to understand cryptocurrencies and how they work so it is very difficult to predict how they will attempt to regulate them but they seem to be accepting the fact that they are here to stay.
@_date: 2016-12-08 22:40:58
Miners also collect transaction fees. The hope is that by the time all bitcoins have been created, there will be enough transactions (and fees) to support miners.

I was just talking to someone about that this past weekend. If one thinks of the supply of Bitcoin as 21 million, some of which are in circulation and some of which have yet to be mined, then one could say it is already a deflationary product. If speculators are keeping this in mind, it's possible that it is one of the factors fueling growth, much the same way as the halvenings seemed to have been anticipated and factored into the market prior to them actually occurring.

@_date: 2017-11-17 00:44:12
A wallet is just a collection of private keys and the receiving addresses associated with them. The addresses are "public" and can be shared safely. Any transactions that involve the public addresses need to be broadcast to the network in order for the blockchain to record the movement of funds. Private keys can be generated offline and never need to be shared with anyone or anything.

The purpose of an offline wallet is to avoid exposing your private keys to anything connected to the internet.
The Bitcoin network is a distributed, transparent **ledger**. Your "balance" is just the sum total of bitcoins sent to your collection of addresses. If a transaction (which, by necessity, must include your receiving address) is not broadcast to the network in order to update the shared ledger then *it doesn't happen*.

Being "computationally impractical to reverse" means that, once a valid transaction has been broadcast to the network, the computing power required to convince the network that another, conflicting transaction should override the first is cost prohibitive.
Bitcoin protects the seller because all the seller has to do is watch the network for the "send" transaction and then they can release the product, confident that the transaction is extremely unlikely to be reversed or negated.
Bitcoin does nothing to correct human nature and cannot prevent people from lying to you.

Keeping your bitcoins on Coinbase is similar to keeping your cash in the bank: your options are limited if they decide to do something with your funds that you disapprove of.
Transacting with bitcoin operates on a "push" basis as opposed to the "pull" method employed by more conventional types of electronic payments. Someone can request a payment but not initiate it without access to the private keys.

A bitcoin address is a bitcoin address no matter how it is generated.
The wallet is just a collection of public addresses and their private keys. The addresses and the transactions associated with them are part of the public blockchain held in every node on the network, only the private keys are kept offline.

Recent forks are simply similar but completely separate versions of a cryptocurrency. Since advocates of both sides hope theirs will be the prevailing option, they both allow you to carry your balance of "old" coins onto the new blockchain. This has resulted in coin owners holding equal amounts of both coins. The last fork surprisingly created coins with significant value or, in other words, money out of thin air. Future forks may or may not yield similar windfalls.

Most online services that create wallets on your behalf will immediately transfer the BTC to their own wallet and "credit" your account. Unless you've generated the keys yourself, you do not control any BTC received, you trust the site to follow through on their promise to do what they say they will do. Fortunately, Bitcoin allows you to prove that you sent the BTC to the address they instructed you to send it to. Contact the site and provide the TX ID.

The ideas behind bitcoins are sound - decentralization being the most important, IMO. While some individuals, sites, and businesses have made some bad decisions or suffered some unfortunate attacks, I believe it's because bitcoin exposure grew a little too fast since the beginning of this year; projects were launched and trust was given without enough careful consideration or proper precautions in place. The exchange rate will most likely remain volatile for the foreseeable future due to the majority of users treating it as an "investment" rather than a currency. I started BitBrew.net because I believe bitcoin use will grow but I wouldn't look at them as a way to turn USD into more USD, but rather as a way to spend my money without having to pay someone else for the privilege of doing so.

Interesting idea but there's no need to bloat the blockchain or create a sidechain. The manufacturer simply first engraves a public key specific to the item in the most appropriate area and includes a message signed with said key indicating that the item now can be sold by the distributor/new owner and records their public key (again, created specifically for this item). Once the distributor sells the item, they sign another message including the latest owner's public key.
This method requires keeping a copy of all signed messages but allows for transfer of ownership without transferring private keys. In essence, it's creating a unique Proof Of Ownership blockchain for each item that only needs to be recorded and accessible in one location.

I believe Coinbase and BitPay waive processing fees for donations to non-profits. In addition, anyone *already* immersed in the Bitcoin economy (earning and spending BTC on a regular basis) won't have to use an exchange like localbitcoins to obtain them.

Okay, it turns out it's very difficult to determine the possible permutations of snowflakes.

While I couldn't find a definitive answer on how to even mathematically determine the likelihood of identical snowflakes existing, even the lower bound seems to be magnitudes greater than what is possible for Bitcoin addresses, public keys, and private keys. (source:

Receive addresses can be used over and over again as many times as you wish. Your wallet never loses the ability to control the bitcoins sent to any Bitcoin receiving address within it as long as you retain control of the associated private keys. As others have mentioned, just about every wallet handles change addresses in the background, out of sight.

To answer your second question first: There are thousands of Bitcoin enthusiasts willing to use it around the globe no matter what the price. The utility remains whether they are valued at 0.000001 USD each or 1,000,000 USD.
In response to your first question: Personally, I believe the price has been artificially inflated by speculators (whether this was intentional or not is up for debate). It's possible that it is just now finding a reasonable value or it may drop again. If it does drop, I doubt it will fall below 100 USD each, mostly due to the fact that I know plenty of individuals who would be selling everything they own and taking on as much debt as possible to snatch up cheap bitcoins, myself included.

In the US, bitcoins shouldn't be considered better because they make the average consumer's life easier, they should be considered better because they are more efficient (on the back-end), they eliminate much of the risk of identity theft, and they help re-distribute the economic power with a bias toward the individual.

My opinion? You must mean my interpretation of the OP's title. No, I was aware of Radio Shack's policy of collecting customers' data on any  types of sale when I posted my reply.
Credit card users were releasing data by *just using their cards*. Cash users have the option of declining to release identifying information but had to give up the convenience that comes along with credit cards. Bitcoin users get the best of both worlds.

Moving the decimal place doesn't increase the value of existing bitcoins, it just makes them easier to divide into smaller units. Removing bitcoins from the economy is was makes remaining bitcoins more valuable.
@_date: 2015-03-26 15:14:40
I think OP's point is that companies like Radio Shack would have no legitimate reason to collect ANY personal data if customers were allowed to pay with Bitcoin and, therefore, would have nothing to sell.

If your coins are confirmed in the blockchain then they haven't disappeared. If the receiving address is correct, then the issue has to be on your end.

Would incoming donations be used solely for 3D printed coin and the tech department? How many students will be participating?
Have you considered creating an asset on a platform like Counterparty? Let's say 30 kids sign up for the hangout. You could issue 50,000 RamCoins via Counterparty,  distribute 1000 per student and encourage them to "tip" their favorite contributors. The remaining 20,000 RamCoins could be offered via a crowdsale to raise funds for the 3D printed version.
I'd be more than happy to participate, too. I've been active in the Bitocin community since early 2011 with the launch of BitBrew.net and I've spoken at several Bitcoin conferences/conventions.
Edit: Just read the google doc and I see the donations are to be utilized for the tech dept. You should have a contingency plan for funds received above and beyond what the dept needs. Charities are nice but there's no reason the school/students shouldn't benefit from it, either.

How's your local bitcoin community? Could you find supplies of any kind nearby available for BTC? Would you be able to count on bitcoiners in the area to support your business?
Seems that your best bet would involve assembling a finished product from resources sold for BTC. Are you creative in any way? Unique, artistic items allow a higher markup.

Even if your company is not billed for their electricity use, it doesn't mean the building owner completely ignores the monthly usage. If the utility bill suddenly skyrockets, they'll definitely notice and it won't be free much longer.

Even then you'll probably have expenses that can't be paid for with bitcoins directly, like fuel, vehicle maintenance, etc.
If you want to be successful (i.e. make a profit), you'll have to compromise on that aspect since limiting yourself to local sales only greatly reduces your pool of potential customers.
I'm happy to discuss business models with you if you want to PM me. T-shirts, for example, would most likely be the easiest to break into. I've created and sold a few shirts paying a graphic designer and a silk screener with BTC.

1. The transaction is immediately broadcast to the network and anyone with internet access can view it. The "validation" you are referring to is more commonly known as "confirmations." On average, a confirmation of a typical transaction takes about ten minutes, although they have been known to take up to an hour or two.
2. The most likely reasons for transactions not being confirmed are low (or non-existent) fees or double-spends. One can easily check the blockchain to see if the appropriate fees are included and/or simply wait for the first confirmation. Double-spends are extremely infrequent and rarely malicious; the amount of computing power and luck required to successfully bamboozle the network is prohibitive in most cases. If you feel that your transaction is so large that the other party may be tempted to cheat, again, the simplest solution is to just wait for the confirmations.
3. Bitcoin is often referred to as "programmable money."

There is a checksum built into each BTC address so it's likely Coinbase will recognize it as invalid.

Very common. Many times the first question people ask me is "Can I buy $X amount of Bitcoin?"
I usually explain that it's just like gold, you don't have to buy an entire bar of gold, you can get an ounce or even a fraction of an ounce.
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:35:22
You should clarify your question.
Do you mean, "How well could Bitcoin handle 50,000+ transactions per second?"
A: It can't at the moment. Theoretical max transactions per second is currently 7 (reality is more in the 2 - 4 range, I believe). Gavin has a proposal that will increase the maximum block size 20X, however, and there's no reason to believe more tx/sec can't be achieved.

It would still be easier and more cost effective to use virtual chips instead of microtransactions. You could still use a throwaway wallet to hold the buy-ins, the house would simply cash everyone out at the end based on the number of virtual chips each player holds.

Those sites keep the majority of the sale and just pay the designer a royalty fee. I've sold a few shirts for bitcoins but it's hard to be profitable without a lot of exposure. If you're interested, I wouldn't mind discussing some of the details, possibly partnering up. I have a few designs and some experience on the retail side of it.
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:29:02
Hypothetically, yes. Of course, if all bitcoins were irretrievable except for one satoshi, that would mean that only one individual would hold all the usable wealth in the Bitcoin economy, a situation I believe extremely unlikely to occur.

LBC waits for three confirmations. The *average* time for blocks is 10 minutes but I've seen them take up to an hour and a half for just one confirmation.

Anyone remember when paying by check was an option and before it was possible to electronically verify the customer had the funds to cover it? At the time, a merchant didn't know if it would bounce until the bank sent a letter via snail mail. In effect, this was like waiting *a week* for a "confirmation" **and businesses still accepted them** because it was what their customers expected/desired from the shops they frequented.
If we continue to ask our favorite merchants to accept our payments in the form of bitcoins, they eventually will even if it means risking a(n extremely unlikely) double spend attack.

Shipping costs could be prohibitive if you couldn't negotiate good rates with a shipping company. Fifty pounds of paper to one customer = expensive. Fifty pounds of paper to 500 customers = much cheaper per package rates.
