Do you honestly believe you are the only person who did research, and whoever spoke against BitShares-x must be ill-informed?
I have contacts who attended the very "WeChat" group chat that signaled the start of a pump about 30 days ago.  It has since become a game of dare, reflecting the pump pattern that every other pump has exhibited.
Yesterday, core members of the 3i-gang cautioned its friends to stop pumping, and to switch narrative to words of caution: "invest at your own risk!" "don't put in more than you can afford to lose!" "I will be more glad if you don't follow my advice and not invest it Btsx!" Classic ass-wiping before a dump.
Now, truth triumphs everything.  The dump has **in fact** started, whether you want to believe it or not.
And a product being an actual Blockchain 2.0 product does not mean it is not **also** the subject of a pump-and-dump scheme.

If you are a victim, write complaint to the Federal Trade Commission, the CFPB and your state's consumer protection agency.

LOL, you are right!  How did they miss that?
