I mean if you have been following it for awhile, why did you buy during a pump knowing that there are always corrections that follow? This is nothing new, it seems like a newbie mistake tbh. Definitely don’t sell now, we are seeing the start of a bull run.

Wow $30. You just made a post about buying $30 worth of bitcoin. Now. If you had bought $30 worth of bitcoin 10 years ago you might have been rich. But instead you waited until it hit $11000. And you’re excited about it. This might be the most depressing thing I’ve ever heard.

The fact that you even posted this is a lil cringey

Why thank you, I was honestly wondering if it was a pump and dump instead of a bull run.... now I know for sure.
