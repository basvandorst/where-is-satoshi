...And the more likely our coins will go from $2200 to $22.20.

You leave out the entire other side of the equation though; Since we're giving the enemy a giant target date to say that we'll be harming his business, if he thinks for one minute that we'll succeed, he'll simply hard fork first.
We could end up with three chains, in fact.

Great article! 
I wish it didn't promote a risky UASF plan at the end, but it is a timeless reminder of history, nonetheless.

This will be huge!

Simple... But don't forget that bandwidth and RAM would be huge factors even before hard disk space. I wish ppl would stop talking about disk space entirely.

Oh he can though, at least for a few minutes or hours... He can make that third chain even if it's going to be merged later, or economically fail, right?
If he does, investors will have a shit fit. I could easily see prices dropping 100 fold. Maybe sub-$10
This wasn't the "digital scarcity" that satoshi had promised them.

Which investors will deem as worth far less since this bitcoin thing is so much more screwy than they thought.
I can just here them now: 'Some USERS decide if the blockchain should fork into a stock split?' How is this digital scarcity??? 
$2,200 - &gt; $22.20. 
Thank you for your recklessness.

That last part will be tough, won't it?
Imagine not being sure which coin will win on flag day... many will be extremely tempted to go over to Shapeshift and wait the fight out as litecoin or ethereum... Certainaly some kind of dip will happen at the fork.
This could be a major, major mess.

They aren't scammers, per se. 
It would be much more accurate to refer to them as idiots who are so dumb that they harm their own self-interests.
Is there a word for that?

Agreed. It's like some folks don't see the downside of a failure.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:01:21
It's OK if it fails?
Non-hodler spotted.
This isn't the place to promote your altcoins.
