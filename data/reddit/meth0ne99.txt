Bitfinex is a metatrading site offering leveraged positions and shorting. Meaning they will route orders through Bitstamp along with their own orderbook. At some point orders could not be routed through Bitstamp causing margin calls to be routed through the Bitfinex orderbook which isnt as deep. This caused prices to internally fall quickly causing a cascade of margin calls. If the site admins had not halted trading the lenders that provide the liquidity used in margin positions would have been wiped out. Without the liquidity provided by lenders the main function of the site (margin trading and shorting) would not be possible. Use this referal code U8I7anGJ6K for 10% off their already low (0.15%) fees when signing up. Disclaimer: I have been using this site for over a year and along with day trading I also lend dollars. This is hands down the best tradng platform IMO.

It can be seen a different way also. Theres now an incentive for them to only spend coins on absolutely necessary things. The temptation to spend coins on alcohol or drugs is greatly reduced due to the perceived cost of the activity. Disclaimer: IM NOT SAYING ALL HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE DRUNKS AND DRUGGIES.

Not really. That was due to something called slippage. When an exchange doesn't have a lot of liquidity a big order will cause the price to rise rapidly because there arent that many people selling at one price.

The exchange has a lending section that allows you to borrow and lend Dollars and Bitcoins from other users. To short Bitcoins you borrow Bitcoins from another person on the exchange using their interface. You then turn around and sell those coins on the maket. You wait for a drop then buy them back cheaper than what you sold them for. This will return the coins to the original person with interest while you pocket the difference of what you sold at and bought back in at.
This is called trading on Margin. You can also borrow Dollars to buy Bitcoins if you think the market will rise. Giving you "leverage".

Bitfinex.com if you give my affiliate code when you sign up i would appreciate it U8I7anGJ6K

I would check out Electrum. You can freeze change address so they are not active and also prioritize which sending address is used. You can even turn off change addresses altogether.
