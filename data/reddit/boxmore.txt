I get that, but my problem is that I lost my passport and I don't have any utility bills in my name at my address. I do have some mail from the government that was addressed to me and my driver's license. 
Before I send my funds through Western Union/Moneygram to Coinmama, it *appears* that all they're asking for is my driver's license number. That I can do. 
But if I send my money and discover later that they **require** a passport and/or utility bill, then my funds will be locked on their site and I'd have to go through an enormous and lengthy hassle to satisfy their verification. I don't want to have my money locked away for weeks while I scramble to get everything in order. I simply do not have that kind of time. 
I just don't want to be surprised by any new, additional demands *after* I've sent my money. If they need more than my driver's license, I will want to get my money back and go somewhere else. I'm nervous that I might not be able to get my money back *or* that it will take them a long time to send me back my money (if they do that at all). As you can see, I'm worried that if anything goes wrong with Coinmama, I'll have to wait weeks before I can spend my money again. 
If I had my passport and utility bills in my name, I wouldn't be bothered by this at all. **It's not that I don't want to verify myself, it's that it will take too much time for me to do so.**

I'm learning more toward localbitcoin now, because I really don't want to deal with their verification bullshit.

So coinmama is not returning anytime soon. That sounds like a lot of work.
