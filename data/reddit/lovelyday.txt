This is a quote from someone who did the maths a while back. Obviously fees are not static, but you can see that blockchain space is not cheap. No-one in their right mind would consider it for storing Lady Gaga videos, so this is just FUD.

All my banks get their fees somehow, even if transactions are sometimes free.
ATM fees, account charges etc. etc. They have fancy, expensive buildings and employees, ... and big bonuses for managers.
Bitcoin transactions __can be__ competitive with that imo.
No, I don't think anyone should decide what is spam other then the nodes of the network and the miners, who are free to relay / mine what they choose. Whether we as the community can keep them "honest" and working "for us" is another problem which we might need to test real soon.

The price is probably falling because a big Bitcoin exchange (BitFinex) got hacked.
A hardfork is a split-up of Bitcoin into two coins. It may result in two long-lived currencies, or one of them may die off slowly over time.
If you have Bitcoins now, you will have them on each side of the split. The value of each coin may be different though, according to how the market sees them, and this will change over time too.

On-chain scaling is NOT a silver bullet. Payment channels have their place.
I'm just saying cutting off user adoption by limiting transaction rates while there's no need to is the wrong way to go.
If you think boosting fees is necessary to incentivize people to move to 2nd layer solutions, I think that's wrong too, but some people firmly believe it.
@_date: 2016-08-13 13:11:51
Well ok, but this highlights an important difference between banks and p2p cash. Banks will certainly start charging you fees if you really start spamming their system. And they can - because accounts.

@_date: 2016-08-13 12:46:08
If you want to prevent other parties from spamming you rapidly with useless shit, you use proof-of-work to limit the rate at which they can spam you / connect to you etc.
As realized by Adam Back with HashCash (for email / list spam originally) and others already a long time ago. Yet to be applied to bitcoin transactions...
The basic idea is you make the other party do a little bit of work, sending you a proof of that with their tx. Removes the profitability of spam.
Other ways of dealing with DDOS involve coming up measures of the usefulness of your peers, and rate limiting them according to that, at least on the relay network.
You might be able to pay a miner to get around that though, but then if the miner risks his reputation and others will try to punish him/her.
@_date: 2016-08-13 12:44:32
Well, I guess self-promotion is something that rich insane people will spend money on. If they speed up the scaling of Bitcoin (like multimedia and VOIP did for the internet) by spending their money then I think Bitcoin will become better for it. If anything we'll find a way to excise useless crap from the blockchain later on, just like adblockers cut out the crap from most of the web.
@_date: 2016-08-13 09:04:34
Yes, sure I have.
@_date: 2016-08-13 12:41:49
Well, I agree with you (and Satoshi) that fees need to take over from block rewards as mining incentive.
That *is* the long term. If Bitcoin keeps becoming more useful, the price can continue to rise without damaging its reputation, and volume can increase, hence the low fees X large volume will result in handsome miner revenues - adequate to cover cost of running nodes.
@_date: 2016-08-13 09:08:10
What use do other nodes have from storing transactions that they didn't mine (and hence didn't collect a fee on?)


They should never be. This is impossible if Bitcoin remains at 1,2 or even 4MB block size while gaining more users and remaining top dog of the cryptocurrency competition.
If you believe otherwise, I have a bridge to sell you.
If you agree, it means your only argument against on-chain scaling is "when" it must happen.

It hurts Bitcoin adoption if it is not competitive enough w.r.t. fees so that people have to think a lot about using it.
You do understand that nodes and miners can protect themselves against 0-fee transactions?
They're not obliged to relay / mine all (or any) of them, although it actually helps encourage Bitcoin adoption if they do allow a few freebies.
The general problem you mention - DDOS - needs to and can be solved in other ways, not by raising fees.

There is a long way to go from "Lightning transactions are just Bitcoin transactions" to "LN is blockchain agnostic".
Sure, in theory it could be (*), and in marketing it already is. 
But when it comes to LN, let's first see the agnostic implementation, based on a proper released layer-1 agnostic specification and design (or better yet: an accepted industry standard).
(*) until that theory has been at least validated by a well-scrutinized design, I wouldn't put all my faith in it.
Also, some folks on the Core supporter side like Nicolas Dorier are claiming that it's not agnostic:
@_date: 2015-12-27 13:11:36
Ultimately, I think cryptocurrencies with PoW algorithms that are more resistant to ASIC mining and therefore centralization pressure will be more profitable mining areas in the future. Unless there is a revolt (PoW) change by the non-mining parties in Bitcoin's ecosystem, I don't see it decentralizing, esp. not if growth is artificially capped.
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:07:37

Yes, in such a way you'd be able arrive at a set of important community figures pretty quickly. Probably 500 quite well-known people easily, including all the developers to date, miners, CEOs of Bitcoin related companies.
As you say, enough to form a good, relatively objective quorum.
Offer them the chance to be part of an initial circle of "initially trusted" Bitcoin voters (meaning they get voting rights by virtue of their roles in the Bitcoin economy). To accept, they submit a public key which will later be used to issue them voting credentials at a voting session. And they can each nominate further two initial voters who will get such an invitation, but these then join the general public in a process to join the voting circle.
Members of the public can join the circle of voters by a one-time registration of their public key. The key should be verified to belong to the applicant by a random selection chosen from the existing voters (e.g. 2 or 3 others).
I don't think the verification needs to be any more strict than e.g. what traders do on Localbitcoins or AMAs on reddit.. The problematic part here is that invariably, it might result in some sharing of personal data over insecure channels. So maybe some more thought needs to be put in to how to make this as safe and secure as possible for the participants.
A further idea would be that these applicant also have to tie a minimal symbolic  amount (e.g. $1 in BTC) to "activate" their voting right, i.e. a minimal proof of stake. It should be low enough that it basically doesn't exclude anyone.
Only the backed registered voters get issued voting credentials at a voting session. Proof of correct voting can be done by publishing a hash of a document containing the voting results on the blockchain. The document will contain the tallied results as well as an audit trail - each vote encrypted to its respective caster's public key.

What nonsense, it's trivial to construct a counterexample:
A critical bug is found to affect Bitcoin Core's software, but no-one in the team can agree on an adequate solution.
Meanwhile, another team forks, proves and releases a fix that would split the chain. Core is unwilling to include the fix. Meanwhile, the majority switches to the new fork and transfers their coins to safety.
The fork &amp; fix would not be considered an attack on Bitcoin, even though the blockchain needed to be split.

No, while the word "untraceable" is bandied about a bit too much, the front page of its website does not state "without possibly being traced".
It states "extremely unlikely that a transaction could be linked to particular user."
I'd argue that if you're wanting to abuse the difficulty of tracing transactions and don't bother to read more than the large-font blurbs, you deserve to be traceable.
One could ask why the FAQ at bitcoin.org claims "Bitcoin users have exclusive control over their funds" when it's so easy to provide counterexamples.

I know this is not a democracy, but waiting for a SW soft-fork does not get my vote.
It's not considered a scaling solution even by Jeff, a member of the Core dev team.
Soft-fork reduces the security of the network because not all nodes are validating to the same standard anymore.
I don't see how the other improvements you mention are critical in the short term, but I do see how block space starvation __can__ occur in the short term.

Let's say I have opened a channel with a website to pay using some microtransactions.
I would have to close that channel down when I switch off my computer - unless that channel is to an intermediary which somehow remains connected on my behalf, no?
When I shut a channel down on my end, if I'm connected directly to the content producer, I'd want to settle to the main chain when I do so. It seems I have to settle much more often than I would have imagined in this case.
If I was connected to a hub, I could choose to pay for a year (or until my funds are exhausted whichever comes first) and I wouldn't worry about the channel breaking down.
So in real terms, I'm still not sure I understand how the direct P2P LN channels would be practical if settlement fees on the main chain were high.

It's important to keep in mind that the above appears to be Gregory Maxwell's personal view on ongoing development from here on, and nothing more.
I wouldn't call it "the plan" prematurely - the discussion in ongoing and even livelier after the conference.
His posting summarizes the options, but it is not comprehensive and he does not claim that it represent any consensus reached after the conference.
I think we would be in a much clearer position if the conference had managed to hammer these (and other) options into a clear list of proposed actions which could have then been subjected to voting by major stakeholders.
Instead, all we have up to now is our own impressions of the conference proceedings and surrounding discussions, a vague statement by way of interview of Blockstream's CEO, and Greg's opinion piece above, which may or may not express the intentions of the Blockstream company to some extent. He left this point unclear and did not disclaim anything.

Using common sense: it's finished once users can download a version approved for production environments.
Until users have not validated a candidate for a finished version, testing is incomplete.
I can't really speculate about how many parts of it still need revision and polishing up, I can only deduce from what I keep hearing from BS statements that a proper release of SW is weeks or months away, that implementation and therefore testing is indeed unfinished.
I certainly hope BS will release a detailed roadmap with firm dates imminently.

Not really. You should be able to hold on to them and see how this plays out.
In the unlikely event that the blockchain forks due to competing implementations, you will end up with your 50+ Gigajigs on both forks. However, it's likely one of them will end up being worth much less than the other. You should then wait and see which one this is, and spend it on the side that "wins" (ie. making sure you're running the "winner" software, send your coins to yourself at a new address on the winner chain to make sure they are recorded as spent).
Then you continue as normal on the new chain with the coins in your new address.

Nothing is untraceable. Nothing affords exclusive control.
If we use this measuring stick, one can call everything a scam, including Bitcoin.

I was going to write "Mommy and daddy are arguing, but it's gonna be alright" but your question certainly deserves an attempt at explanation.
There is a parameter in the Bitcoin Core implementation which is called the "max block size". Since blocks are issued roughly every 10 minutes, their size effectively determines how many peer to peer transactions can be performed in the Bitcoin system within that time period.
This parameter was introduced to deter an overly large amount of spam transactions from bloating the block size and crippling the performance of the network.
As the number of Bitcoin adopters is steadily growing, the demand on the system is growing naturally too. 
Some people have been looking at this and saying: "Soon, the blocks are going to be nearly full of legitimate transactions. To prevent an ever-growing backlog of transactions which have not made it into a block, we have to increase the max block size."
This has been opposed by another group with a different philosophy, which believes that blocks becoming full is not so bad, because users could simply pay more to get their transactions included quicker, and this would lead to a healthier market for transaction fees developing. Something which needs to also happen over time, since Bitcoin is designed in such a way that transaction fees become an ever-more important part of how the system is kept ticking.
There is a third group, who contend that Satoshi, the mythical creator of Bitcoin, never intended for this parameter to stick around, and that it should be removed altogether, letting the size of blocks be entirely freely determined by the market.
Bitcoin Core, the second group, have just released this statement to demonstrate unity behind a controversial roadmap they suggested after the last conference on this matter.
The other groups (bigger blocks and unlimited blocks) do not currently support this plan.
Expect lively debate and perhaps the first, but not last, major hard fork of the Bitcoin software and blockchain.

Honest mistakes can already be avoided by wallet software. I routinely get asked if I think my fee is enough, and I have time to reconsider and change the transaction before signing it. This would also happen at a point of sale.
As someone pointed out already in another thread, once we get to a fee bidding war, there is no good strategy a user can follow to ensure their transaction is included in a certain number of blocks.
The question should be whether we want to allow access to Bitcoin to devolve into a game of "who's got the deeper pockets". I suggest that if we're seriously contemplating that in the face of ever cheaper processing and bandwidth costs, we are dooming Bitcoin to lose against its competition (altcoins).
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:15:09
Sure, it's a nice wallet feature, but it should always come with a hefty "we cannot guarantee it" disclaimer, because it's essentially a lottery.

So this makes RBF useless if the network is congested. Right?
@_date: 2015-12-03 10:26:15
I'm not arguing that blocks need to be faster than 10 minutes.
Until now, you could transact practically instantaneously with a low level of risk using zero-conf. Now that core has accepted RBF this will become more difficult.
While I like the theoretical make-up of Lightning, it is too early to tell if the economic environment in Bitcoin will be likeable once it arrives. We might be faced with huge fees on the blockchain, and non-negligible fees for using Lightning.
So while I hope Lightning comes to fruition, I can only see something good coming out of it if it does not become a forced solution. I hope Bitcoin's block size will rise, regardless of Lightning, so that there will not be congestion.
This still leaves valuable use cases for Lightning.

Based on the suggestion of the software and my ability and willingness to increase the fee.


It's not about charity, it's about the kind of thinking that wants to make block space a scarce resource. Here's a little thought experiment.
Miners would be subsidized by large corporations to reduce the nominal fees that their customers have to pay to get confirmed quickly. A transaction with a higher nominal fee will be left out to dry in favor of a low-fee payment to a corporation that compensates the miner in return.
The concept of "increasing your fee through RBF" becomes totally useless.
It will be a matter of "buying from the right shop", i.e. the corporation with the bigger pockets.
Fostering the well known capitalist condition: "the rich get richer".

How can someone steal your coins without getting hold of your private key?
And if they have your private key, they will try to steal your coins again and again until they either succeed or you have successfully transferred your coins to a different wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-21 08:09:29
Let's think this through.
There are many people (miners could consider them "customers") who think zero-conf is a useful feature to have in Bitcoin.
Miners who implement full RBF can correctly be seen as destroying this feature.
I could see this result in them being blacklisted by nodes (full nodes as well as other miners) who want to stand up to protect this feature.
So, it does matter. To their own mining business.

If I was a miner, I would be interested in ensuring that with each halving, the block size at least doubles, actually more because there are additional real-world costs like fiat inflation, costs to keep equipment running and competitive etc.
I recently read a claim that a burger from McDonalds costs the equivalent of 16 US cents in Venezuela. Not sure if true, but it illustrates that your 4c is a very relative number in terms of what people in the world might be able to afford.
Plus, your statement "more than 4c" is open-ended, no upper limit. 
Let's say you pick some minimum fee X &gt; 4c.
All transactions &lt; X would be revenue lost to mining immediately. Are you able to speak for all miners in implying that mining transactions &lt; X makes no economic sense  them? For how long, in the face of rising transaction volumes, rising price of Bitcoin, rising capability in technological terms, do you think your assertion would remain valid?


A callous and uninviting attitude.
You are disenfranchising a portion of humanity who would be able to transact if the minimum were &lt; X. This does nothing but cause them to move to other, perhaps less secure but cheaper currencies. Perhaps revenue lost for a long time to Bitcoin's ecosystem.

Miners know that the value of Bitcoin depends on whether users are satisfied with the experience of using it, and this in turn determines whether they can continue mining or have to go look for another job.
Therefore they should manage their resources in such a way to get the best possible experience for their customers, both in terms of transaction fee and transaction time.

IMO: 
Do not use a wallet that gives you no choice about the fee. It's ok for the wallet to recommend levels of fees based on network conditions.
But if you want to send your transaction with a minimal fee, you should be able to exercise your RIGHT to do this, as long as you are aware it might take longer for your transaction to be confirmed.

While the idea has some appeal, in practical terms it means no-one will use anything except the last advised size, which is practically defeating the dynamic aspect of the algorithm (it will be nearly inert as long as there are competing miners, since there is a clear "winner" block size that will always get preference and no-one would risk mining other block sizes as long as there is even just one other miner who is following the advice strictly).
I even think it would lead to a long delay (until the next "advice adjustment") where a transaction backlog would not really be corrected because the incentive for any miner to "up the ante" has been removed. The miners would all have to agree to play nice and simultaneously start mining equal but bigger-than-the-advice blocks - something that will never happen!

A switch which enables Full RBF presumably causes the flag which disables RBF in the transaction when sending your coins to be ignored.
Only one miner has to enable this and the respect for the "Disable" switch will be destroyed sufficiently so that it cannot be considered a working mechanism anymore.
However, enabling this patch is something a miner could do anyway, that is why RBF - opt-in or not - destroys the relative safety of the existing zero-conf.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it would need to be in practice.
And I agree that reddit, github, bct, news sites etc. can get a lot of persons for a  good start, and the rest is basically word of mouth to get more people to sign up and be vouched for.
The assurance around the voting process could be automated to a large extent. 
However, I would be a little uncomfortable if the voting results didn't come in the form of dependable, tangible numbers, so that requires a little infrastructure and process.
Personally, I like the concept of delegation voting as implemented in [LiquidFeedback]( If we could get something like that going with some kind of user vetting, that could go far.
@_date: 2015-12-22 13:31:19
There's something to add to this: there are limits to the block size which arise naturally due to qualities of the network, e.g. how long does it take to propagate 1MB of data across, and the bigger the block the longer it takes and thus more likely to be "outdone" by other blocks, and thus orphaned (thrown away by the network).
One argument is that there is room for a healthy fee market to develop freely within the natural boundaries of miners being able to choose to mine anything from very small to very large blocks, depending on what strategy suits them best (and this might depend on their local environment, e.g. network bandwidth and connectedness to other nodes etc.) This is where my preference also lies : let the miner decide the size of his blocks, taking the risk and reward of doing so into his own hands. Will this lead to more centralization of mining (something which is also a philosophical hot potato in Bitcoin)? There are many arguments around this, and the best we can do is study them ourselves and arrive at our own conclusions. One thing I am persuaded of is that it is early days in the Bitcoin adoption phase, and technologically the capability exists to increase the max blocksize quite a bit, keeping fees low for the time being. I think this will spur interest and adoption in Bitcoin by the general public and of businesses, raising the price and paying for gradual improvements of the and decentralization of the infrastructure. Enough of my opinion though...

Right now, yes. Why? Because there is a limit commonly enforced by Bitcoin software. Let's ignore for a moment whether that is a good thing or bad thing, and whether it has consensus or not, it's a fact that it's an artifice.
Over time, as humans strive to increase bandwidth and processing power for their other computing and communication ventures, the block size absolutely need not remain a scarce resource, even in the short term. Bitcoin computing resource needs are pithy in comparison to those of our other computational needs as a species.

Thanks. My description of the third group was perhaps a bit too unclear because I was trying to simplify. To be clear, I am referring to the Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) proponents. They don't want __any__ blocksize limit (perhaps short of what the protocol can maximally provide -- for all intents and purposes there would be no practical limit if their wish came true). As far as I understand it, most of their argument centres around a belief (unsure how well founded) that concerns about too large blocks would be mostly taken care of by the market (e.g. to simplify: "block too big?" "it would usually be orphaned, thus causing a natural incentive against too-big blocks").
Of course the first group, in general, are "large blockists" who agree with the BU folks that the current limit was always meant to be temporary, but don't subscribe to the view of removing it completely (e.g. to preserve anti-spam function). So they are in favour of raising the limit in various ways or making it a dynamically computed value, but not entirely abolishing it. They are concerned about certain pathological cases that can occur if there is no limit at all, or if the limit is too large for the current physical infrastructure to handle (e.g. Gigabyte-sized blocks). I am not yet familiar enough with arguments/solutions, if any, which the BU group has advanced to mitigate these fears.

IMHO the best they could do is implement their own crypto-currency based on Bitcoin's design, but with some of the limitations removed to make it feasible for their country. Not sure if that's practical though, given that they basically need the solution *now*. They probably should have been working on that since a while ago, to have it ready for the tough times that are now upon them.

What can be said about the effective blocksize in that case is that it is the minimum size which a majority of nodes and miners will accept and relay.

He already sent emails to miners informing them of the voting process.
It is no more unethical to distribute the pool hashpower according to the expressed will of miners as it is to allocate the non voters to a particular client.
Either they don't care, then they will not mind now, or they do care, in which case they can express their vote or re-register in case they lost their access details, or move to a new pool if they are not happy.
You have only proclaimed that you find it unethical, yet you have not really given any solid reason why it would be.

You're not listening to what the street is telling you.
If you're selling very expensive stuff - sure, wait for confirmation.
Otherwise, merchants are fine with the risk of 0-conf due to the majority of customers being honest, and the increased volume that it brings.

Of course it's emergent, there is no one entity in the network deciding on what the maximum block size should be. It is left for miners AND node operators to decide what size of blocks to produce and relay - and this in turn depends on the economic incentives.

Ok, there must be &gt; 1 nodes for Bitcoin to work at all.
So then by your definition it is always decentralized . Surely that's not going to move the debate forward. We can accept that there is something like centralization that could happen, even though no-one's given a very good definition.

If they want to sell those bitcoins, which is what the whole Chinese Bitcoin industry is about, then they had better be comfortable with transferring them to an address to which they do not hold the keys.
I think that Bitcoin mining is too centralized in China, but if they carry on processing transactions (and hopefully scaling the capacity soon), they are doing an honest miner's job.

You are correct.

This is interesting. You are painting a world where signalling happens before a change in Core software is actually implemented. However, BIP9 doesn't work like that.
You avoid my question about what makes it into Core software.
It's only relevant in the context of a majority of hashpower (and I would argue Bitcoin users too) wanting a block size upgrade, but not getting that from Core. Even it if were something straightforward like a base block size increase to 2MB or 4MB.

The article, despite starting out in a relatively objective way by summarizing the pro and con views, thereafter affords much time to discussion why the pro's could actually work, but does not spend time even trying to debunk the counterarguments that have been made.
There is zero mention of the systemic impact of accepting RBF as a Bitcoin feature.
That is to say, as RBF is introduced, merchant acceptance of 0-conf must fall, because it makes it much easier - basically default under the mentioned "competitive fee market" (*) to double-spend.
So many use cases that are possible today then become [nightmare scenarios for customers and merchants](
\* which is referring to a fee market where block size space is capped so that blocks are routinely full, i.e. transactions then *have* to use RBF to obtain satisfactory confirmation times

This __is now an election__, and there is no time left for lengthy mediation.
You know that Satoshi is widely presumed to hold ~1M Bitcoins? Even if there is a minority fork, those 1M coins moving could send an unmistakeable signal, a "vote" if you will, that Satoshi endorses one or the other of the forks...

Sometimes in life you have to do what's best for the greater good (Bitcoin) and not just for your short-term interests (Lightning).
2MB will not decentralize Bitcoin mining any further, nor make Bitcoin unsafe.
It might mean you need to postpone SW a little to wait until the network has upgraded in capacity, or change the discount structure, or ... you'll think of something smart.
It's not the end of the world, not for Bitcoin. It's a new beginning for companies that right now are going out of business because they believed in Bitcoin, they believed in Core.

I'll quote the full text from that [great post](
I want to see RBF protagonists argue it again (who knows, maybe they have finally come up with better counterarguments):
The cashier says excuse me sir you have paid with an RBF transaction and we do not accept RBF transactions.
OK says the man refund me and I'll pay with cash. Sorry says the cashier but I can not refund you. You'll have to send another transaction but make it non-RBF and then send another transaction to bump up the fee on the first transaction and change the destination to yourself thus refunding yourself.
How do I do that says the man shaking his head in disbelief. Well says the cashier it depends on which wallet you are using and as I am not familiar with your wallet I can't really help you.
I'll just pay in cash says the man this bitcoin stuff is just to complicated. The cashier says OK but your first transaction will go through as well if you don't bump the fee and change the outputs. So if it is going to go through says the man why don't you just accept it.
Well says the cashier if I did that you could leave the shop and then do a double spend and the boss would be mad at me because we would lose out. I have another idea though, you could wait for the transaction to confirm in 10 minutes or so and then I can accept it because it will be too late by then for you to so a double spend.
OK says the man, this is crazy but I'll wait 10 minutes to keep the peace.
Ten minutes pass . . . . . . .
OK, says the man, I am going now. Sorry sir, says the cashier but your transaction has not confirmed yet. Because bitcoin is limited in how many transactions can fit in a block, you transaction did not make it this time. You will have to wait another 10 minutes.
Look, says the man, I have played this game enough I have to go now. OK says the cashier but you need to pay me in cash. If you come back later I'll check to see if your transaction has confirmed and I will refund you.
F*&amp;&amp;# hell says the man. This bitcoin shit is really weird and f'd up. You can be sure I won't be using it again.
Man exits and tells all his friends that unless they are computer scientist with hours of free time they should forget about bitcoin.
Cashier talks to boss and tells him another pissed off customer just abused her over bitcoin and asks why the hell they accept this crappy payment method that no one can understands and which pisses off their customers.
Boss says OK then we will stop accepting it, I don't need more strife in my life.
Rinse and repeat enough times and we will never have to increase the blocksize because nobody will be using bitcoin.

The solution is simple: increase the blocksize.
Transmitting larger blocks is much more efficient with Xthin, and it would reduce the proportional amount of transactions that need to be flooded around the network all the time because they didn't get mined.
The only reason we're stuck with inefficiency is because Core refuses to do the logical thing and scale the basic protocol.

That's what I mean by : the receiver doesn't have effective opt-in.
There would need to be a way for the merchant to ensure that the transaction is not broadcast to miners with RBF enabled from somewhere else while the merchant sees a non-RBF transaction (which ends up not getting mined).
I don't think that's possible, for the same reason that double-spend attacks are.
@_date: 2016-03-09 09:57:07
I wouldn't call it a departure from Bitcoin principles.
They have got a fair share of mining power, they have got an exchange... and they are including their own transactions with priority.
Every miner has the right to choose which transactions to include.
They are not violating that principle.
They have to somehow pay for providing that service (no doubt by charging their customers or sacrificing a bit of profit they would have made in other ways, e.g. through the block reward).
It's optimizing the service for *their* customers.
If there's anything to be concerned about, it's the centralization of mining power that has taken place.
If you don't like that degree of centralization, then you should vote with your feet by supporting other miners, pools and exchanges.
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:38:14
The gist of insurance (a topic which I first heard floated by Adam Back btw):
Since either party in a LN payment channel can settle to the blockchain at any time, the other party can effectively run off with your money.
So honest parties will need to insure themselves against this risk.
This insurance could be provided as a service by hubs (much like banks and VISA protect you from fraudulent charges), or maybe transacting parties would get their insurance from specialized insurers, who knows.
Regulation should be there to protect people. If you are transacting with Bitcoin, you assume a higher degree of financial responsibility for your money, in my view. That could be argued to require less "baby-sitting" by regulation.
The free market allows for other types of payment systems which might be much more highly regulated "as a feature", and might cost more to transact across.
So depending on level of safety I require, I could choose how to transact - Bitcoin or "BankCoin".

Opt-in transactions are specifically marked with an “RBF flag”.
The software that receives them can decide how it wants to process them, including the option of ignoring / not relaying them.
I already acknowledged that *some* may get through, but only if all the full nodes the transaction passes through relay it until it hits a willing miner.
Miners can and do decide which transactions to include, and they can very well decide their own policy on RBF. 
Are you unfamiliar with [what happened at F2Pool when they implemented RBF](

As long as it remains opt-in only on the receiver side, the door to double-spending with it is open, no?
As for "trivial to detect" - I've heard experts say it requires a wide network of monitoring nodes to detect.
Who except major business can affort that - certainly not a mom&amp;pop store.

People don't seem to understand that there are a lot of users who want a more permanent solution to the scaling issue.

2. in your December post on SegWit [2] you pointed out how it changes the economics. As a Classic developer, how do you view the impact of SegWit's impending soft-fork release and possible activation upon Classic's elective hard fork strategy?

The above example assumes both parties are just honestly trying to do business.
Under that same assumption:
If my transaction as a customer never confirms, the honest merchant will just ask me to retransmit it, which I will gladly do, and hopefully the network will process it this time round.
The merchant might ask me to add a little on top for his inconvenience, which I as an honest customer might be inclined to pay for him being a good merchant (because he doesn't refuse to do further business with me but instead wants to resolve the matter).
I might end up slightly peeved at the Bitcoin network for failing to confirm my initial transaction. And perhaps I would next time choose a payment method that might be less prone to failure. But that's all hypothetical.

The pool operator is not imposing his own opinion on the process at all.
He has received a lot of input from the community requesting him to use a fairer way to distribute the non-voting hashpower, rather than allocate them all to one particular implementation purely due to inertia.
Following the input of his customers is not unethical.
Perhaps the remaining non-votes are an AI that is unable to comprehend what voting is (yet). /s
@_date: 2016-03-07 22:09:57


Tru dat.
The correct response is to raise the limit so that it's safely above peak transaction volume, and not engage in central planning economics by distorting the fee market through a severe software limit that is technically not needed anymore.

Personally I don't care if miners around the world "cartel" and set a fee floor of the order of what Bitcoin transaction fees used to be back when blocks weren't full.
Oh yeah, why were blocks not full most of the time?
As long as the floor is low enough to attract more users, miners will be spoilt for TX choice and able to discover the balance of which block size is right to optimize their revenue.


There is probably an element of truth to this and the intuition that the future is a bit of a crapshoot.
However, there will be counterpressures against a too-decentralized Bitcoin. If it exhibits flaws (anything users don't like) due to that centralization, users will take their traffic elsewhere. Who knows, maybe decentralized payment channels will be a reality by then. I would hope so. I think other cryptocurrencies will stick around and provide impetus not to centralize, or Bitcoin will bleed users.


I'm vaguely hopeful that the larger the mining operation, the more sensible and experienced the miner, including knowledge of what makes Bitcoin valuable and what sort of actions are to be avoided.


They take risks, and may get burnt.

Small block chain miners are also in control of what transactions they include in blocks. How can it get 'clogged up'?

That imaginary 0.001 is leaving out a lot:
- the charge to set up the payment channel
- the loss of interest on your money while it is locked up in said channel, unusable to you
- the cost of insurance (though perhaps factored into the setup costs)
- costs imposed by regulators on hubs (surely passed on to consumers)

I must disappoint you, Satoshi is not going to sell over a little dispute like this which will resolve itself quickly anyhow.
Besides, just like AntPool mining a couple of BU blocks got Core's panties in a tight bunch, if Satoshi as much as sold a few coins on any fork, I think you would see a stampede for the doors. Even a signed message from Satoshi indicating intent to do so would be enough, I guess :-)

Untick the box in your (future) wallet that says "Enable RBF for your transactions" (or something similar).
Disable the setting in your future node software that says "Allow relaying of RBF transactions" (if you're using sensible node software then hopefully it will be disabled by default).
If you're mining, enable whatever setting you need to reject detected RBF transactions.
True, it won't stop all RBF from getting through to the blockchain. But it will help a great deal and if enough people do it, 0-conf remains as usable as today.

Empty blocks have been mined by miners practically since the dawn of time.

It's an arms race, for sure. But it's entirely possible to make the POW very expensive for ASICs (*), effectively not making it worth for ASIC manufacturers to keep up this race.

Not able to read Swedish - can you TL;DR ?
@_date: 2016-03-08 01:48:29
No, it wouldn't.
Let's say there are two miners - both want to maximize their profits like you say.
It is not a reliable assumption in today's network environment that both of them have access to the same transaction at the same time.
This is the basis of your claim that 0-conf is inherently unreliable.
The same applies to an RBF transaction - it is not guaranteed that both miners have received it at the time on of them finds next block.
The relaying node network is important too here. As you say, RBF is not a part of the consensus protocol. Therefore relaying nodes are free to implement their own policy w.r.t. RBF transactions. Which could see the relaying network split up into an "RBF-supporting" faction and an "RBF-resistant" faction. 
This in itself will lead to increased unreliability of RBF transactions.
@_date: 2016-03-19 10:29:06
Relaying nodes are relatively free to choose what they consider spam. (*)
Miners likewise are free to include what they want in their blocks.
There should be no top-down economic policy decisions.
If you are unhappy with the amount of spam, get involved in the parameters that your node allows you to configure, and express your preferences directly on the network.
\* (plus it's open source, you can in theory configure your node to follow exactly the policy you wish)
@_date: 2017-03-03 11:39:34
a) right now the money is dropping off the table as fee-paying transactions age out of the mempool which is at 80K+ . There's every reason to assume people will use every way they can to avoid paying fees - if it is appropriate to their situation. E.g. they will use payment channels and the upcoming LN to avoid mainchain fees, or move to cheaper, less secure alts if their use cases allow. The miners who want to "clean up" low-paying transactions once in a while are also doing the system a valuable service, and there's nothing wrong with being rewarded for it. There is no incentive to consistently produce bigger blocks out of the lowest-paying transactions, because THAT would be leaving money on the table. Miners are free to establish their fee floor, and the economy will respond accordingly as I've said. This does not presume total collusion or a cartel.
b) Bitcoin is built upon a presumption of a majority of honest in the sense of rational miners. Centralization pressure exerted by big miners would not go unnoticed. Not sure if your 'mining cartel' is referring to current situation or a hypothetical future, but if they were to actively destroying the potential for other participants in the network to fully validate, they'd be destroying the economic base that gives value to the coin, and they would be the ones to suffer next. I don't think a majority of miners that are successful enough to participate at today's levels of required investment are so short-sighted. Technological advances such as parallel validation provide a disincentive towards bloating blocks - your orphan rates would increase compared to your competition who don't produce bloated blocks.
In short, it's a fallacy that bloated blocks would result due to "infinite demand" - this would require miners to go against their own interests.
@_date: 2017-02-26 05:01:57


How would they know whether the block they're mining on top of is valid or invalid according to the new rules?
They can't ascertain that unless they run behind a 'filter' / 'border' node, which is effectively "switching to the new software".
Therefore they have to effectively switch to the new rules - it is not optional. No miner would mine on top of blocks they couldn't validate fully.
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:19:02

When you receive them, you can reject (ignore) them.
Nodes can refuse to relay them.
Miners can drop them.
Wallet software can refuse to support (send) them.
RBF is not needed right now, and if enough participants in the Bitcoin network refuse to support it, it will not take off and 0-conf will remain usable.

Big block chain miners could incentivize the use of their chain - that makes sense competitively.
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:00:19
That would be trivial to detect iff the transaction passes through YOUR (merchant) system before it is allowed onto the network.
In practice, there is no reasonable way to enforce that, is there?
So it's back to "monitor the rest of the network to see if the RBF "feature" gets used against me in an attempted double spend."
@_date: 2016-03-06 16:26:50
Your analysis is interesting. Yes, flight of capital to altcoins is happening - it's (a) an escape valve for those confused by the volatility and uncertainty caused by this schism and (b) a way to hedge against the risk of ongoing internal strife.
Altcoins, incl. Ethereum, are just as good an alternative for small-block supporters as they are for big-block supporters and any other investors looking to spread their risk.
The misunderstanding is to think that both schools of thought can "get what they want" - in the end there will be only one *significant* "Bitcoin" surviving this difference of opinion. The forks that claim to be the better "Bitcoin" will split off and have to prove themselves in the marketplace. They will either wither or die, or one of them will eclipse the existing "Bitcoin". Unless they rename entirely, in which case they place themselves into the existing field of altcoin contenders and will have to establish their new brand at the same time.
Of course it may be that another cryptocurrency eats Bitcoin's lunch entirely in the meantime, and that Bitcoin in its entirety becomes irrelevant. This could happen if it fails to scale and keep up with features that are important to the market.

People __want__ to use it at their own risk - not have someone tell them that 0-conf is "too risky" for them.
I used 0-conf to buy software on the Humble Bundle. It worked great.
It was the first time in a long time I felt that a merchant actually trusted me - an honest customer.
It also made me feel the true power of Bitcoin as a payment method. I was downloading within 30 secs.

Show me an analysis of the network security impacts caused by SegWit's soft-fork deployment strategy which means non-upgraded nodes don't fully validate anymore. Where are the uptake projections and commitments by the community to ensure that successful adoption even happens?

Sometimes it's not the big corps that are doing things most effectively, remember that. Calling other coin supporters "bagholders" isn't going to make you right automatically either. But as long as you feel superior, keep at it, pride comes before the fall.


Wake up, full blocks are disturbing the ecosystem in terms of average confirmation times and rising fees. Good job!


Like I said, show some real evidence. It seems if there is any analysis done @ Core / Blockstream, these are not made public, otherwise you could point me to them.


Holders are in it for the long run, so is Bitcoin's competition. Wake up, fast - the coin's value depends on successful mass adoption and increased utility, not hoarders. Those $5 purchases are what's going to prove to people that Bitcoin is useful. No-one goes and spends $1M on something they've not tried out with small amounts.

Consider the hardforks in Monero. Litecoin. Ethereum. And most other cryptos of your choice. Smooth as butter. Point is, the spectre of calamitous hardforks has been vastly overdrawn. We should take advantage of Bitcoin's young age to show a successful precedent. If anyone has the best strategic position to do so, it's Core + the current miners. Pity you folks want to waste that opportunity.


Consult the recent Cornell position paper which has shown that upgrades to 4MB would be safe for the majority of the network. Based on real measurements of block propagation across the Bitcoin network, the authors calculated that at an average block size of 4.1 MB, 10% of the network nodes would be unable to keep up, while at an average block size of 37 MB, half of the network nodes would be left behind. They suggested that the size of blocks should not exceed 4 MB.


Money is being lost right now due to missed growth opportunities. If a major world crisis happens, Bitcoin is not ready to absorb the influx. Who's fault?
Take a good look at the comments from business leaders who are saying they want to, but can't invest right now in Bitcoin because it's not fit for the scale of their businesses.
Just the other day Steam dropped 0-conf support again. Does that tell you anything?


Why would we want to force nodes to upgrade? It may be that they want to run on a &lt; 1MB chain forever. At that point they can fork off hard and preserve their small block utopia. Luke-jr has the Keccak code ready (thanks to him for trying the PR stunt, it was good for lulz).

I think you should be allowed to contribute and defend yourself anywhere you post. Rate-limiting has never substantially impacted this, indeed as a feature of Reddit you should be petitioning the admins to abolish it entirely otherwise you are using a site which does not support a free and open discussion, by your own logic.
If you think rate-limiting is censorship - can I ask you: is rate-limiting deactivated for everyone who posts in this sub?
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:09:11

The bitcoin address above sent coins that were seized which were implicated as coming from DPR -- Dread Pirate Roberts of the Silk Road.
You can see the blockchain.info transaction data mentioning "DPR Seized Coins" on the target address.
EDIT: I messed up interpreting the amounts tied to the address. Looks to me like the LOL bit is the implication that this 5.11 BTC donation stems from a shady source.
EDIT2: the leaked mails and the bitcointalk.org thread show that "John Dillon" (john.dillon892 requested to borrow 5.1 BTC from Peter Todd, and the mail above has a good signature from John Dillon. He also describes himself

I'm not a US citizen. Perhaps the answer depends on that, but regardless of what the law says, the law does not always play fair.
As a non-citizen, I'd have no significant rights to deny a search, so I could not ensure that any wallet has not been copied.
Any wallet so compromised must be considered lost, and its contents transferred to a new, secure wallet lest someone else, who now has access to the keys with reasonable probability, steals your coins.

UDP based, so quicker and can go through firewalls easier.
Can mitigate packet loss (e.g. such as caused on Great Firewall) if used in conjunction with some forward error correction (essentially send duplicates and hope something gets through even if others get lost).
Also, you'd be talking to all your peers to get your missing transactions -&gt; that's why it's 'torrent'-like compared to xthin where you are still receiving the txns from the peer that told you about the block. Like xthin can co-exist with the existing standard p2p protocol, depending on whether a peer supports it or not.
Probably none of these block propagation methods should strictly be seen as replacing the other - they could coexist and will certainly perform with varying degrees of efficiency depending on circumstances.
In future there could be some adaptive algorithm to evaluate protocol performance and adapt on the fly.

How do we know the price will not tank in the meantime so as to make Bitcoin mining entirely unattractive vis a vis altcoins?

1) Bitcoin was never advertised for micro-transactions - it's not exactly suitable for that due to it's 10-minute block period. That's partly why Lightning was conceived, and it was always advertised to solve the micro-transaction problem for Bitcoin. For that use case, I support Lightning as a value added on top of Bitcoin.
2) agreed - low fees have traditionally been part of the formula for Bitcoin success
I agree that raising fees artificially by keeping the blocksize restricted is bad for Bitcoin's success as a payment alternative to existing methods.
But I do acknowledge that the fee market per se is not a bad idea - it is a crucial component of the incentives that sustain Bitcoin in the long run. Bitcoin just does not need central policy to force fees artificially when it is in the phase where it should be enjoying rapid growth.

Bitcoin fees do not remain negligible in real-world terms as the Bitcoin price itself rises.
The miners pay their infrastructure costs in local currency - not Bitcoin, so for them a rising Bitcoin price and large volume of low fees can perfectly well sustain their costs.
Perhaps not quite as low as today when the block subsidy is still large, but still there is no need to dramatically increase fees right now.

You are right about the danger of linking your information in a central place.
Bitcoin was not designed from the outset to be anonymous, rather it is pseudonymous through its use of cryptic addresses.
However, all transactions are currently linkable and traceable through public information in the global ledger known as the blockchain.
Most exchanges where you can buy Bitcoins comply with whatever regulations such as Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer* (KYC) exist in your country. That usually means they have to identify you, and that establishes your identity on the blockchain pretty easily.
Unless you are very careful to protect your identity when obtaining and transacting with Bitcoin, it is very difficult to transact in a way that preserves your anonymity.
There are some cryptocurrencies which do more to protect the anonymity of transacting parties and the details of transactions (amounts). 
Some argue that it is a good thing that Bitcoin does not attempt to provide strong anonymity, because that would bring down the hammer of regulators.

In terms of attack potential, change of POW has been referred to in the past as 'the nuclear option'.
Recently, legal opinions have been voiced on the potential liability of hard forks, and POW change would seem to fall squarely into that category. It seems that keeping POW in sync would be the natural course of trying to prevent such a hard fork.
I really don't see it being pulled off successfully though unless development on one side turns closed source, because of the amount of element of surprise necessary to pull off such a 'POW attack' in the face of the other party not wanting a divorce of that kind.

That's a bold assertion which contradicts a fundamental idea in Satoshi's whitepaper.

@_date: 2016-02-10 19:24:37
Not everyone has to upgrade simultaneously (and as you point out, this is a pipe dream). It is enough that a sufficient majority do, and the laggards will follow.
Successful hard forks have been done before many times by other cryptocurrencies. There is no need to over-dramatize them to the extent of pretending they are unrealistic.
There is no need to build something ugly to solve the current problems of Bitcoin. If you are referring to a Segwit soft fork as envisaged by the core roadmap, this imposes more software development work on the downstream users than a simple bump of the block size ever would.
I get that SW comes with additional benefits, but staring at the abyss of full blocks as users and businesses wanting to adopt Bitcoin currently do, and refusing to acknowledge the simple solution is just harebrained, and does not endorse one as being a good steward of the project.

Tom's point was that even SPV wallets can be made intelligent enough to not require network comms just for creating a transaction.

You can sign a transaction offline and cast it out to the network later :-)
A full node (even with an outdated copy of the blockchain) has the information to determine how much its wallet holds. If its state is inaccurate (because the user spent those inputs already from another location) the network will simply reject the tx.

There is no intrinsic reason that all the transactions you mentioned could not be made in bitcoin. Yes, banks do have good reasons to exist (growing businesses).
In this case, we see them discontinuing accounts for existing business customers apparently because they changed their mind halfway through. Having the power over businesses that they do, and often colluding, makes this at least appear not above board from the businesses put into existential crisis due to it.
Same goes for the individuals who have their accounts closed because they wanted to buy some bitcoins e.g. through LBC.
It sends a clear message from the banks that they will decide what you or I are allowed to spend our money on.
And to businesses, what payment methods are acceptable (those that go through the existing institutions).

Wouldn't getting DDOS protection from your upstreams be more valuable for your business in the long run?
@_date: 2015-04-02 15:53:48
To operate it usually requires secure entry of a user-customisable PIN.
As in, the device displays a keypad (digits 0-9) in a random grid pattern, and the browser app displays buttons in a grid. You press the buttons corresponding to your PIN and matching the grid displayed by the Trezor.
The Trezor's display is fairly small, so this method offers quite a good protection against visual snooping, as the actual numbers are not displayed on the computer monitor.
EDIT: There is an additional mechanism which allows to protect the seed with a passphrase. If you forget that passphrase though, you'll have to accept the loss of the wallet - it is thus covered under Advanced and not recommended without caution.
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:37:43
The "backup" is a seed of 20 words that can be used to re-generate the wallet.
This seed is created the first time you set up the device, and you write these words down and keep them secure.
If you lose the device (breakage, theft, loss whatever) you buy a new one, and re-initialise it with your previous seed, and you're back in business.
For more info read the [Trezor User Manual]( read up in  ... and the [Bitcoin Wiki]( which is an excellent resource btw. Avoid brain wallets, and cheap knockoffs of real hardware wallets.

Ok, I have not needed to do this myself, but the [Trezor User Manual]( covers your situation.
First thing that's good to know is that since you have your 24 word phrase, you can always recover access to your coins.
You will need to follow the procedures outlined in the User Manual section.
1. [Wipe your Trezor](
I think you do NOT need to do the lengthy section entitled "Changing your TREZOR recovery seed" on that page, because what you want to do next is RECOVER you previous seed as below.
2. [Go through the Recovery Process]( to configure the trezor with your 24 word seed as you wrote it down previously. Don't configure/change any of the advanced settings. You will probably need to change the PIN (although it doesn't hurt to try if you can configure the same PIN again)
You should then have full access to your account again.

Yup, never saw such posts from him before the XT fork. Really weird and seemingly out of character, but either way, I'd like these tweets to be vetted by him or other reliable sources through another medium.

I would not be too sure. Corporations migrate to where they can extract profit.
Bitcoin empowers people like the Internet once did. Ultimately, those nations who suppress it will find themselves at a disadvantage compared to those who embrace it.

It's not patenting mining per se, just an optimization to the process.
And a 10-20% speedup in mining does seem like an innovation.
Patents can be licensed non-exclusively. I don't think we've heard enough details to assess the implications of this venture.
Another sticky point is whether the patent would cover software changes to Bitcoin as well - if so there would need to be clauses so that no fees would arise for duplicating the software (because Bitcoin is free).

I'm all for supporting musicians who release their music independently, but this just sounds like some jukebox / "insert another quarter" BS:


I want to *BUY* your music, not rent it. This would be a step back from existing media and an erosion of consumer rights.
Embed your Bitcoin address in the MP3 that I can buy and download.
Music player software can be set up to auto-pay if the listener feels like doing so.

Being able to transact, in a way that we see fit, is a fundamental human freedom comparable to freedom of thought and speech, even if it's not written in our charters yet.

Thing is, there isn't even a leak here for WL to get involved.
At least, the leak is not Satoshi's identity, which CSW is trying to claim anyway, and it's not like anyone is trying to stop him from releasing that truth (or not) to the world.
So WL, please use your twitter for leak-related stuff, why dontcha?
@_date: 2016-05-07 22:46:00


Agreed, everyone decides for themselves. It is good that Core has come to this realization, because many of us have reached it for a while now.
I hope this means they will stop calling forks like XT, Classic, etc. "attacks".


Now you're exaggerating just a little. Notice all the different full nodes in the network? This is due to Core not listening to a substantial segment of the Bitcoin user base. It's their right to do so, but you should not deny the reality.


This is exactly the wrong attitude to take as stewards of a free software development project (imo), and what lead us to the present situation. But the good thing is that Bitcoin is ~~open source~~free software.
@_date: 2016-05-31 20:08:58
It would be great to see similar data comparing CB and standard protocol on a different selection of nodes, incl. some connected to the relay network.
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:00:21


The irony is strong in this post, the tired old painting of any alternatives to Core as an attack of some sort, the attempt at besmirching by association.
Core has simply failed to listen to the community, and as a result we now have good alternatives, and more to come.
And the ultimate irony perhaps is that due to the myopic outlook of the Bitcoin maximalists, the altcoins have only gained in strength more than they would have if Bitcoin were allowed to grow freely.

Wladimir is the one who could remove Gavin. It's probable that he did it himself (otherwise his account was hacked, right?)

Though we are in Bitcoin, we should always still consider ourselves as part of the wider cryptocurrency community, and help to lift up other innovative currencies as well. There is no need to put all our eggs in one basket.

I guess it's because I was here before the censorship started, and I quite liked it.
Also, because I don't like people telling me where I should or should not go.

If you want the public to be able to truly follow a proof attentively, it could make sense to string it out.
Reserving judgment here.
EDIT: the major flaws (undisclosed Sartre file, obvious bug in script)  in Wright's post today are not exactly inspiring confidence. He should either correct / explain or not be surprised that people don't take him seriously.
@_date: 2016-05-07 20:09:43
I think you have one thing right - there will be competition, and I also think it's healthy.
You don't need to follow whatever projects Gavin works on, he is not forcing anyone, he has shown no inclination to making Bitcoin more permissioned.


This is your personal opinion, it would serve to preface it as such.
@_date: 2016-05-09 21:02:20


This might have tripped some alarms ;-)
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:41:28
Then you say 'the facts don't support...'
Otherwise it's shoddy.
It sounds to me like Wikileaks is a bit miffed that they weren't invited, because there's good reason to assume these organizations they are dissing here have MORE facts than WL. And of course, never miss a good drama to dish out some side swipes.

So, no Venn diagram?


I conclude that your recent angry actions were attempts to garner "the indignation which they naturally call forth in that of the impartial spectator". Much like a little child throws a temper tantrum.


Perhaps you should consider the extent of your benevolence. It seems you do not call for transparency and openness in this sub, for example. And if you learn to command your passions a little better, I would say it would stand you in good stead.

The line between troll and non-troll is a fine one, and sometimes temporary.

On the contrary. By raising Bitcoin fees you decrease the amount of custom for businesses, making it necessary for them to raise their fees in turn.
