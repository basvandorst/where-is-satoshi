Then why don't I get insurance on my mutual funds, stocks, bonds, T-Bills, Safe deposit box, and anything else that a bank holds for me and insurance isn't mandated by law?
EDIT: See MF Global, where they literally stole assets from customer's segregated accounts.  No insurance there.

Note that the only reason banks have FDIC insurance is because they're REQUIRED BY LAW, not because they want to protect their customer's.

What percentage of thefts are due to someone compromising your phone?  I'd bet it's less than 0.001%.  At that point, you might as well say the withdrawal limit is **useless** if someone kidnaps your family.

Then bitpay sells the coins on exchanges where people are buying in.  Assuming they're not all day-trading specuators, I don't think it matters if the merchant keeps bitcoins, or someone else gets to keep the bitcoins.  Someone is always 'buying in' when someone else is 'selling out'.

Imagine you create a altcoin where it's agreed that each coin is worth one dollar.  I'm a miner.  I have 1000 coins and it's time to pay rent.  Nobody wants to buy my coins, but I need rent.  So I sell them for 75 cents on the dollar to a savvy investor.  Now the price isn't pegged anymore.
Unless you have someone who's willing to guarantee the value and give you dollars whenever you want, people will just start trading based on unofficial values.  This actually happens in countries where there is an official and unofficial exchange rate between the local currency and the USD.
In addition, there's not much motivation to speculate, bucause there's a cap on the profit you can make.  Some one might buy coins for 50 cents on the dollar, but no one ever anywhere will pay $1.50 for a coin worth a dollar.  It's not a very good deal for speculators.

Fees vs. hassle.  If it's 0.5 BTC, I'd just juse coinbase because it's easy.  If it was 12,000 BTC, it would probably be worth my time and effort to see how I can get international wire transfers, etc, to minimize fees.

Analogy time:
You're paying for the DHL international overnight express rate from New York to Japan with arrival by noon.
Would you say "It costs me just as much to overnight a penny to Japan as it does a new computer, and that's STUPID."?
I think the problem with everyone yelling about the tx fee is people are using clients like multibit.  Bitcoin-qt won't ask for a fee on a tx like that, assuming the coins are reasonably old.

Waht does ripple add?  I'm being serious, not just talking shit.  It seems ripple is trying to be electronic hawala.  Hawala solves the problem that an average person can't send money long distances easily.  But I can easily send bitcoin long distances as an average person.  So what do I need ripple for? No ripple advocates have ever given me an answer on this one.

No offense, but who are you people?
* Both this account and the bitcointalk account were setup just a month ago, have no established history, and only exist to promote easycoin.  They have no history in the bitcoin community.
* The prospectus throws out a few names, but I have no way to know if these are real people.
* The slick video doesn't show any faces of the founders.
* Comments disabled on video.
* You say you'll only break even or possibly lose money in this venture.
*  just has a stock "It works!" page.
Does beta testing involve actually sending you money? Why should I trust you since with such little info about you and history?

That banks only insure to fulfill regulatory requirements, and when they don't have to they don't.  They don't insure as a service for their customers.
So it's a bit unfair to say "Well banks insure up to a quarter of a milion dollars, it's a no brainer that coinbase should do that" when the banks only do so due to regulatory requirements.

That's market depth.  You can see a better visualization here:
The chart on the bottom of the page shows exactly how far the price will drop if you sell X coins on bitstamp.

The owner is a huuuge libertarian who is always appearing on shows like Stossel and Judge Napilitano (wearing a nehru jacket like a James Bond villian.)  Watch some of his appearances:
I have no doubt that he's interested in bitcoins for ideological reasons and not just to make easy money.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:02:35
Actually that was the Navy.

How many coins? 0.5? 20? 12,000?
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:37:30
That's fair enough.  But what I was trying to say is that he's doing it because he sees fundimental value in bitcoin.  He's not doing it because "OMG All these stupid people are caught up in a silly bubble and I can exploit the idoits to make even more money."

If I said a tank you might have a point.  A computer doesn't weigh *that* much more than a penny, or require that much more space or fuel.  You're paying for the speed of delivery in this case.
You're paying out the ears because DHL rushes a delivery van to your house, and then flies a freaking jumbo jet to China.  You could put that same penny in an envelope and mail it via USPS and it would be cheaper than the overnight service.  But it would take a couple weeks because it'll go via freight ship.  And it might get lost in the mail.
There are two reasons you need to pay a fee:
1. To get the transaction in the block chain **now**.
2. To get your **large** transaction in the block before many small transactions, where **large** is defined as a complex transaction, not the number of bitcoins.
In the case of 0.01 BTC, you don't have a large transaction.  You're paying for speed.

Also, the free-market solution would require either raising fees, or allowing coinbase to keep fractional reserves so they can invest money to pay for insurance premiums.  Worded like that, it becomes even less appealing to most people.

But once again, why do I need ripple?  Why don't I just deposit bitcoin/cash into an exchange that supports multiple currencies? What value does XRP add to the process?
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:18:25
Bitcoin is money.  Money exists to eliminate the double coincidence of wants problem.  Why do I want to convert bitcoin to ripple to X, instead of just bitcoin to X?

2014 will hopefully be the year Wall Steet gets involved, causing an order of magnitude increase in price.
Things I hope will happen, but probably won't.
* Iran agrees to accept bitcoins for oil.
* A South American Central Bank announces that it has purchased bitcoins.

The fed is a central bank.  The PBC is a central bank.  The fact that the fed is a private corporation is irrelevant for this discussion.
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:10:20
That's what I was going to say.  Any exchange, any currency, bitcoin is up over 30 days ago.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:53:07
That's the central bank that controls the money supply and sets policy, like the Fed here in the US, not a commercial bank like Chase of Wells Fargo.

JP Mogran, whenever he was asked where the market was going, had the stock reply "The market fluctuates."
