I’d personally take a Bentley over a Lambo. I don’t get why everyone wants a Lambo with their profits.

The only issue I see with mainstream BTC adoption is the time of transaction and unstable value. If BTC was stable at a fixed value then It can move forward. Imagining buying a soda-  one second it’s $1.50 then when you swipe your card it’s $1.53 then by the time you leave the store it’s $1.32. The public wont understand bitcoin until it’s at one stable point.

I don’t trust anything this man has to say after what he did with BCH in the past.

Nothing crypto is sound to me. I can withdraw at anytime now and I’ve made a decent amount of money. That’s all I can judge it off of.

There isn’t much you can do with $80. Your best bet is just keep it in Coinbase.
The minimum on bitconnect is $100 and other like sites have minimums.

It’s sort of like the founders of The US were from the UK or something.
