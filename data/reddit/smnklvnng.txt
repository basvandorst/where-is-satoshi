I'm curious about this too. I have my coins stored somewhere else than Coinbase. But wouldn't it be clever to move them to my Coinbase BTC wallet before the fork, just to get the B2X coins? Or could this be some kind of set up, to have all the users fill up their wallets, before making all the BTC magically disappear, like what happened with Mt. Gox..? 
Owning 5 BTC in an offline wallet if B2X is the real deal would suck. Owning 5 BTC and 5 B2X would be prett sweet, or what?

Cheers. I'm on holiday overseas, and had to reset my phone earlier this week, making me unable to trade at all during these last crazy days. Before that I followd my own protocol, buying on the way down. Bought at 7300, and 6800. Would have bought at sub 6k if I could, but I won't be able to trade again until I get back home tomorrow. Fingers crossed, but kind of happy that I had to force hodl, so I didn't make any bad decisions during this madness.

That's what I thought. Clever bastards.

False. It's a Model S. Model X is SUV-style.

Sweet, thank you all

Oh, that makes sense. Didn’t read all the comments. I’ll watch out next time

Are you just messing around? It's a Model S. I live in Norway, both Model S and X are seriously everywhere. A quick search on Swedish number plates also proves it's a Model S.
