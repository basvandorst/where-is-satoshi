There are a couple of ways to interpret your question. Did you mean why are there merchants willing to accept bitcoin the same as they would a dollar or euro? Or did you mean how is the price of bitcoin (currently about $330 USD = 1 BTC) determined? 
The latter is simple and there is only 1 correct answer. Supply and demand determines the price (to purchase/sell on an open market).  Of course there are factors that affect supply and demand but, in the end, the market supply and demand are what determine the price bitcoin is bought/sold for on exchanges. 
The former, which is a benefit value in contrast to the latter, which is a price value, is much more open to opinion. If you live in the US and have no reason to send money internationally the fact that it provides instant transfer of funds at little to no cost is of little benefit to you. 
This is where bitcoin can become more personal and the benefit values can change or be similar or dissimilar from 1 bitcoin user to the next. 
Some examples:
For a long term investor the fact that there is a hard limit of ~21MM
For a merchant the fact that fraud is removed from all transactions
For the international traveller the fact that they can have a form of payment that can be accepted internationally
For the gamer the fact that they can buy games instantly online without a credit card. 
For the philanthropist the fact that it is extremely easy to tip someone money online as easily as you would a taxi driver or server. 
For the sports bettor the fact that you can play without depositing money into a sportsbook account and payouts are near instant. 
For the internet user that visits online sites with paid content the fact that you can pay for this content without exposing any of your personal information. 
The are many more reasons and the statements that apply to bitcoin users can change from person to person. 
In about 18 months the daily supply added to the market will be halved. The next 24 months could provide a very interesting chapter for the story of bitcoin.

Why is a licensed money transmitter not currently working with Casascius to supplement their product offerings? By adding funded bitcoin to their inventory a licensed money transmitter can quickly and easily transmit bitcoin in addition to currency. Can you imagine if you could walk in to Western Union or Moneygram and buy bitcoin in the form of Casascius coins?

It sounds like he has an idea and he wants to see if it has interest. My guess is this is not an altruistic endeavor but rather one that leaves a profit trail. To the OP - I think your idea has merit and it looks like it shows some support/interest. Best of luck.

Hey baller, keep paying it forward.

This is plausible. Most merchants are charged a fee, typically at least $15, any time a customer disputes a charge. This fee is charged to the merchant whether they win or lose the chargeback. If they win they still lose that chargeback fee. If the cardmember or issuing bank wants to see a sale receipt to substantiate a charge there is another fee called a retrieval fee. It is not too difficult for a low margin online business to lose money with a merchant account if they receive many chargeback or retrieval notices. A 10:1 ratio could spell disaster in some cases.

If you assign Bob a trust score of 80% (a statistical failure rate of 1 in 5) he probably wouldn't be a candidate to hold private keys or seeds, or at least not more than 4 of them. Also, if you distrust your laptop as much as you trust it you probably should not be working with any sensitive data on it. 
To answer your question, no, there is no rigorously defined formula that is going to protect you. Protect 100% of the private keys and seeds in an "approved" method (e.g., offline generated cold storage) and protect it the same as you would a large amount of cash (don't let anyone see it, touch it, or even know you have it).
