ETHiots have that oh so special quality where they’re both ignorant AND arrogant. Watching them tread water while Bitcoin continues surging has been great and this is just the beginning.

B-b-but when sharting plasma comes out in 2 weeks you’ll see
@_date: 2019-07-25 19:39:57
Funny, when ETH price was rising they
cared so much about a supposed flippentarding.

Dash is a scam instamined shitcoin that needs to go fuck itself
@_date: 2019-11-03 23:18:57
How many BTC approximately?
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:56:58
You don’t trade, you never used a crypto trading platform but you’re an expert on the subject. Okay then
@_date: 2019-10-05 22:56:07
So much bullshit, the scam is coming right back around and they can start over again. See you in 4 years for Eth 3.0 (which will DEFINITELY be PoS)
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:52:03
Sure sure, you’re the best and the smartest. Best of luck regrouping after that forced liquidation, you’ll get there champ.
@_date: 2019-08-24 10:39:55
Check out mr. r/iamverysmart over here. He gets it and no one else does
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:49:39
Lol, because it is? Just visit their subreddit’s and it’s pretty fucking obvious. Eth cult is mostly laggards that missed BTC and were stupidly fooled by Eth’s dishonest marketing hype, blindly believing anything their cult leaders Vitalik “80% premine” Buterin and Joe “Weeks not months” Lubin tell them. Not to mention how they rolled back the blockchain because Vitalik and other insiders lost money in the DAO hack. Eth is a disgusting project full of disgusting scammers, all backed by a circlejerk cult community.
@_date: 2019-08-24 11:02:29
Sure you do. Check out r/iamcringeaf you’ll fit right in. Genius gets liquidated and thinks everything is a conspiracy lol
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:16:53
Cryptopia hacked, Quadrigacx hacked.. Poloniex hacked, the list goes on and on
@_date: 2019-10-03 18:39:43
Someone inevitably says exactly what you’re saying at every halving.
@_date: 2019-10-06 18:15:48
Eth had 5 years to learn from BTC and other cryptos that came before. They didn’t. Why?  Because they’re a group of children that can’t code, led by a malnourished autist. Again, you’ll never get it and you’re making excuses like the typical ETh cult apologist. Now back to your circle jerk echo chambers you go!
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:03:38
2013 lol, and you think that’s early? Lucky for you you’re delusional enough to “win” regardless of the facts so it’s pointless to continue.
@_date: 2019-08-24 10:45:16
You don’t understand a fraction of what you think you do and it’s cringe af
@_date: 2019-10-05 21:51:20
Ew, why would you hold those instead over BTC? Especially Eth, jesus f christ what a shitshow that cult project is. And litecoin is the most pointless of all.
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:29:55
True they probably “hacked” themselves
@_date: 2019-10-16 21:35:10
Dunno man maybe a service that helps people with their crypto questions and help them get set up? But honestly i wouldnt mix in person and crypto at all, the less people that know you have crypto the better
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:47:33
Lol what a fucking idiot you are for making such a comparison. Bitcoin was brand new at that time, the first cryptocurrency ever. You are clearly out of arguments if that’s all you can come up, you don’t get it and never will. Back to your cult!
@_date: 2019-10-16 11:21:33
Why would you go through the trouble of loaning people crypto? You actually expect people to pay you back? Do you have an army of thugs to collect payments for you? Sorry but you can surely come up with a better business idea than lending people things and hoping they return them
@_date: 2019-10-28 10:47:39
This u/podcastsandpot is a clueless ignorant that goes around spamming the same garbage  in every crypto sub. He is clearly a subhuman degenerate and pathetic Nano bagholder
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:52:52
They liquidated because they were hacked.
@_date: 2019-08-23 11:56:58
Don’t use the mycelium wallet they created for you. I hope this goes without saying
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:01:56
True enough!
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:46:01
He’s right but you’re still going to keep it up there aren’t you. Because to you what’s important is not that you have 3 BTC, you want OTHERS to know you have 3 BTC. You want people visiting your house to ask you about it and tell you how cool and important you are. You need outside validation.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:51:59
No response from OP because this never happened.
@_date: 2019-10-30 22:29:38
Lol you again - i’m nice to those that deserve it. Not useless delusional ignorants like you. Blocked
@_date: 2019-12-17 17:44:58
Nicely done. They realized there is only one true immaculate conception cryptocurrency, everything else is simply a shitcoin copycat designed to enrich the founders
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:50:48
Txid or this didn’t happen. Most likely you just want to keep the 6 BTC - and let me guess, none of the BTC you moved to the void was your, and you’re not going to use any of your own money to cover this supposed fuckup. How lucky they are to have a friend like you
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:09:51
Most people trading BTC in Canada traded on Quadriga. There were no “better” services as Quadriga was by far the most liquid. 
Every fucking time something like this happens there are inevitably people like you r/iamverysmart patting themselves on the back for not losing money and 99% of the time it’s because you have NO MONEY. You stand on the sidelines with 0.001 BTC talking r/iamverysmart. So fuck you and your holier than thou attitude
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:15:41
Evil prevails when good people do nothing. When you see greedy bags of shit creating shitcoin projects like Ethereum to enrich themselves it’s your responsibility to say something and call attention to it. Meanwhile bagholders, Vitalik apologists and paid shills will argue tirelessly trying to perpetuate and legitimize the fraud. So yes all of this is pretty unavoidable.

This can be simple variance. Network speed is calculated by how fast the network is solving blocks, a few longer than usual blocks might show up as a lower network hash.

So you’ve been saying for years how BTC dominance will fall yet it’s been going up for well over a year? Tell us more about your super enlightened Bitcoin theories.
@_date: 2019-09-05 23:41:20
It’s a good thing because all the pointless premined shitcoins like mEth are falling to zero where they belong, while their arrogant delusional bag holders continue talking about a flippening ��

Travala.com recently announced they accept a few crypto
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:45:20
Fake site trying to steal your info. the correct site is travala.com

This degenerate has to be one of u/aminok alt accounts. Same arrogant delusion in both cases.

Have you checked the public btc address? Are the 5 btc still there?

More than likely what happened is your “partner” changed the password when you weren’t around, now he can empty it once you give it up as lost. Sorry this happened - never trust anyone when it comes to your money or bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:53:05
Good to know - don’t rule out that he’s testing it on the smaller wallet before doing the same on the bigger one - maybe claim how he was “hacked”.  It might be a genuine thing right now, but trust me if those coins inflate to a much higher value you will almost certainly get scammed by your partner. You will want your coins under your control exclusively, which is really not complicated, just regularly transfer your share out of the shared wallet to your own. Heed this advice and thank yourself later
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:07:28
Gotcha - thanks for clarifying. Still a good idea to have your own wallet imho. Really hope you manage to access the wallet
