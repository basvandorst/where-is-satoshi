Whats your point?

1. US makes transacting in Bitcoin and trading Bitcoin illegal, including mining. Banks stop working with exchanges and other companies working with Bitcoin. 
2. Bitcoin liquidity drops.
3. Bitcoin price drops.
4. Miners can't sell their Bitcoin even at low prices.
5. Miners shut down.
6. Hashrate drops.
7. US government buys or seizes abandoned mining operations.
8. US controls the majority hashrate and censors transactions.

Except is illegal to trade and mine bitcoin in the USA.
But lets assume miners join in other countries where it is still legal. So its just an arms race between private capital and Fed's money printing machine.
Who is going to transact on Bitcoin if there is no guarantee your transaction goes through. Who would buy Bitcoin if you cant send it with any degree of certainty?

If you have the majority of hashpower, you control the entire chain. Longest chain wins, and yours will always be longest
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:08:30
Speculate! Why did you stop? If you think of the possible next steps, that will greatly help you in predicting the future. And frankly, you understand that would be the end of bitcoin as a common currency
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:31:46
And what happens next? What does the government do?
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:43:29
The current Bitcoin consensus is "the chain with the most PoW is the only valid chain". If you have majority of hashing power your chain will have more PoW. Miners choose which valid  transactions are included in the block, so effectively with 51% you can censor everything on the network. No need to change consensus.
I am not getting what you are talking about. Why do the Feds need to change consensus?

And where does the blockchain physically reside from which thw wallet directly requests balances of the addresses it controlls?
@_date: 2019-10-10 06:36:43
Why so much noise if its about nothing?
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:08:32
Who do those hardware wallets share all your addrrsses with? They need to pull up your balances from somewhere.
Also, how do you know the device is genuine or the software it runs is genuine or a seed they generate is random enough?
@_date: 2019-10-17 23:30:39
The narrative of low merchant adoption is wrong
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:51:05
Actually. People receiving a transaction from you know which address your change goes, since it's in the same transaction recorded on the public ledger.
@_date: 2019-10-18 00:11:39
This is not the best comparison. I dont know which country you're in, but PayPal is much more convenient, faster and safer. Online bank transfers are more or less instant (maybe with the exception of US).
Being an email for money is not the value proposition of Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-16 12:52:02
I dont know. Amd i dont care - my credit is insured.
@_date: 2019-10-17 20:49:22
Done. Please share your knowledge

They will spend bitcoin only after they run out of fiat, or in the cases where fiat is not accepted

Here is an easy question for you: when moon?
@_date: 2019-10-17 23:36:23
Can you elaborate? Instructions not clear
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:10:34
What do yo mean by the "premium is driven by miners"? Miners are the sellers not buyers.
Also, the cost of bitcoin production depends not only on the block reward, but the difficulty (we assume  ASIC efficiency amd electricity cost is the same)
@_date: 2019-10-18 04:48:08
You got it from Szabo's Shilling point? Saifedin Ammous has a different view on money. Economics is not a hard science, moe, sov - is just semantics. It only makes a difference if you prediction of the future is right or wrong.
Bitcoin is accepted in more countries than any currency, and by more people than most currencies (probably top 20). And still not a moe? Or you mean you need to add a subjective opinion - i most people i transact with dont accept it, its not moe?

There are a bunch of bitcoin meetups in canada, why dont you join an existing one
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:43:39
Oh. Are you implying this is a wrong subreddit? What kind of questions am I supposed to ask here?
@_date: 2019-10-17 20:22:20
We are all waiting for your explanation

Do you trust that the maintenance guy won't take a picture of your metal plate in that safety deposit  box?
Isnt the ethos of bitcoin "dont trust, verify"?
By investing in security you mean buy a hardware wallet and rent a deposit box.
How do you know your hardware wallet is not going to steal your bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-10 06:26:08
Wallet clustering.
You can't definitely say if they can or cannot deduct your other addresses. It depends on your previous and future transactions, how you organize them.

Gold is easily exchangable to any other currency. For something to be a store of value it needs to be in demand, which makes it a medium of exchange. Whether it is a widly acceptable medium of exchange or not is a different question. USD is not accepted in 99.5% of the world, will you argue its not a medium of exchange?
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:40:06
Are you arguing that there is no difference to move from 10 to 1000 and from 10M to 1B?
Its possible to come up with some marginal scenario where there is no difference, but I dont think it really represents whats happening
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:05:18
As long as the conpany comfortable using it, anything can be money.
Oh. Ok.

I host a weekly crypto meetup in Toronto. We also stream all our presentations on YouTube. Maybe you can learn something or give me a feedback. Id appreciate that.

Whats my level of knowledge, and what would be the right level of knowledge?
@_date: 2019-10-18 09:45:31
Telling people about your bitcoin is bad OpSec
@_date: 2019-10-10 18:39:19
You dont make sense. The right level of knowledge to ask the question what Bakkt is, would be knowing what Bakkt is?

How can a miner charge more? Its a free market with free floating price discovery based on supply and demand. No one can decide to charge more

Do you have problems paying for coffee or online with traditional tools?
Bitcoin transactions are not fast and not cheap. And it has a tendency to apprciate over time.

ROI is the highest. However, how do you adjust for the risks, the biggest of which is private key management?
@_date: 2019-10-12 19:25:51
How many have you sold so far?

AFAIK there are no open source chips. Am i wrong?

How do you use 1 cent? The lowest price I can come up with is 25 cents for a pay phone. Then again, pay phones don't exist anymore.
You know they stopped making 1 cent coins in Canada
So 1 sat = 1 usd is good, but then there is this dusting problem. The smallest tx now is 152 bytes, and the lowest tx fee is 1 sat per byte. Anything less than $152 in your UTXO cant be spent.
And probably by then tx fee of 1 sat per byte wont  be feasible. Even now on a good day for the next block confirmarion tx fee can be 100 sats per byte. So your $15, 000 are stuck.
Think about it before investing in Bitcoin.
In Bitcoin, anywhere you look far enough, there is a mindfuck.

You still didn't answer the question. The manufacturer can be compromised or the device can be compromised while in transit. How do I know it disnt happen?

You won't need bitcoin on Uranus. It wont have any value, money is a myth.

As i said by your definition USD is not a medium of exchange since its not accepted in 99.5% of the world.
Anything that you acquire notbfor consumption but for further exchange is money with a function of store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account.
If someone takes a chicken sandwich as a payment it makes it a medium of exchange, if it is not widely accepted as a payment, then its just not a widely accepted medium of exchange.
And that is why you dont understand the value proposition of bitcoin, as 99.9999% of bitcoin users

What made you think $1300 is the fee?

The best investment is in your education about crypto. You will get burned again if you concentrate on feeling the touch of BTC. 
Back up your 2FA, before its too late
