That's called being a money transmitter and you will need to register as a business and pay taxes. If you are not going to collect profit you are taking a substantial amount of risk for no reason other than to help people - which is noble but will cause horrendous problems for you *AND* them if things don't go perfectly smoothly.  
 You should consider starting a business. If you are, go read and learn about entrepreneurship and maybe even take a light business course. There are free ones available online  and although they are not going to garner any sort of credentials upon their completion they are still a great place to learn.

hitBTC has never done me wrong. I sent $40k USD of bitcoin there and withdrew it 3 days later. They confirmed my withdrawal and released the funds within 20 mins of my request to withdrawal and the coins confirmed on a slow / clogged mempool within 10 mins. Fee was only about $5 USD which is still somewhat high but acceptable in my opinion.

Bitcoin has been actively developed and supported for over 9 years being the first blockchain and the only recognizable name in crypto to the average Joe. Nobody knows what an altcoin is outside 'our little community' now 8 figures strong. The people who aren't using crypto but sitting on the sidelines are not even remotely interested in anything other than bitcoin *if* they are interested to begin with.
 Segwit, LN and RSK were developed for bitcoin. Not a single alt dev team or community would have been capable of building working second layers in the time bitcoin has.
 I've seen alts come and go. The only two that have staying power right now are LTC and ETH. Eventually if smaller coins like VERT can grow their community organically there may be some competition but nothing will dethrone bitcoin in the near future.
Why don't you go ask the primecoin devs or terracoin devs how their project is going? Oh wait, you can't because Sunny King disappeared after running them both into the ground.

Thing is, this cycle repeated all through 2017. It was in the 3k range in Sept after the first PBoC 'ban' rumors. It builds up support and explodes up then consolidates to find a floor. The floor is never permanent and never moves in a single direction consistently but it has always risen periodically never to return to previous floors. It just takes time. 
 This exact pattern has repeated at least four times since Jan 2017.

The user base is growing faster than exchanges can maintain. Hundreds of thousands of people signing up that have to wait for verification then set up their wire transfer info and wait possibly weeks for that to be verified then up to 14 business days to wire the funds because banks are slow as fuck. The number of OTC transactions on localbitcoins and via bitcoin ATM's is skyrocketing and shows no signs of slowing. Velocity seems limitless right now.

That's a waste of 10 BTC for any attacker. The goal is to drive up the price of fees not spam the pool with minuscule tx and no fees.

I'm not saying people shouldn't try to learn how to secure their own keys, but people who can't or won't or are incapable of doing so can benefit from market exposure without having to risk their capital be lost by their own lack of experience or understanding. I see it as positive for anyone looking to enter the market in a custodial manner. Might as well be an ICE backed product than say Coinbase or some such.
@_date: 2018-09-30 23:23:23
you have no clue what BAKKT is up to. If you think they can offer asset deliverable 1 day futures without stockpiling the asset first you need to think a little harder. the fact that they are offering these services custodially is a tell. once they open for business you can expect prices to fly.

If the money gets pulled from ATMs quickly enough, someome loses. Wheher it's the bank or their insurance provider. If coinbase loses your bitcoin they will replace it and make an insurance claim just like a bank would. If *you* lose your bitcoin you are completely fucked. That's true even with coinbase if the loss is your fault. If you get scammed they aren't responsible.  
 At least they have serious counter measures and billions of dollars worh of capital to protect. 
  
 But I'm sure the average person who can't even figure out what a private key does can rely on themselves for the same protections.. After all they want to be their own bank right?
@_date: 2018-09-30 19:07:11

@_date: 2018-09-25 19:19:18
The point is the money is insured. Also, you should watch trainspotting 2 because ATM fraud is a huge problem to this day. They clone bank cards then move en masse at around 11:00 PM so they can withdraw max amounts from the cards. They empty out the ATMs across a whole area using multiple operatives and hundreds or thousands of cards. Then at midnight they can do it again because the max daily withdraw limit resets. 
 People have stolen millions in one shot doing this. It happened a couple months ago in India, the largest operation of it's kind in history. 
 No matter what, insurance covers loss. They will "make you whole" in no uncertain terms which means restoring your bitcoin holding not based on fiat but actual bitcoin. Doesn't matter if they lose a lot of money in doing so should anything happen, because that's how insurance works.
@_date: 2018-09-30 23:19:43
It costs a certain amount of money to mine a bitcoin, you can assume the miners wouldn't be around for long if they were losing money. Bitmain probably keeps prices strong by bidding them up or holding back from selling too much if the market is dropping. Obviously they can't control prices completely or indefinitely but when your business depends on a certain minimum price to sustain you're very likely to take active steps to ensure that price point remains stable. It serves to say a miner like Bitmain probably has deals with exchange(s) to supply liquidity in the form of bitcoin, as the exchange is a market maker. They can help each other exist in harmony. In return the exchange will maintain the market as best they can and supply liquidity in the form of fiat to the miner if and when necessary to keep the miner's lights on. The largest and most liquid exchange can keep the price within a threshold regardless of free market influence.

Exactly - serious breaches are difficult to accomplish against a giant like Coinbase and if they lose your capital they have safeguards in place to replace it. If you get scammed or hacked for credentials it's not their problem. It's much more likely the average person would be targeted and hacked or scammed than a billion plus dollar corporation who's business is to facilitate the buying and selling of bitcoin. 
 People try to hack Coinbase all day every day. When was the last *serious* breach?

If they omit you 'by accident' and your lack of awareness due to their mistake caused loss you should be able to sue them for the loss. Find lawyers in their (IG) operating jurisdiction and negotiate a potential lawsuit. Some lawyers might offer to work pro bono or take compensation only if you win the suit. You can also include the expense of attorney(s) as damages and compound loss. 
 It goes without saying the fine print alway applies. Make sure to read your contract and agreement with IG to ensure they had the explicit obligation to warn you of the changes. If they somehow managed a clause in the agreement that they don't *need* to warn you, all of what Inhave suggested becomes moot.
@_date: 2018-09-20 02:16:44

Yes, use an ATM with no KYC requirement. As soon as you pay the machine and it sends you the BTC you will only need one confirmation before you can spend the BTC.

A lot of people are literally incapable of holding their own keys.. If they participate in bitcoin via custodial products I personally have no problem with it and neither should you. Do you bother people about a Roth IRA or a Vanguard target fund?? No. So mind your own damn business and maybe the business of your close friends and family. Telling people they're wrong for using a product or service if it's the only entrance to the market they are capable of is a dick move even if you think you're helping them. If theyr're either going custodoal or nocoiner, custodial should be the obvious choice and we should support that.

Those coins will be backed by ICE and their near infinite appetite for risk, secured by insurance policies and the very high profile nature of the exchange itself. It will be safer than holding your own coins because if *you* manage to lose them they are gone forever. If BAKKT loses them you receive an insurance settlement. It's win-win.
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:24:37
Not certain but I assume WU will only send $$$ to Iranian banks from the US. I don't think there are options for transferring Toman or Rial to a local bank. WU would only process your money order to Iran.. You want them to process the Iranian citizen's order but I don't think WU is a thing there. 
TLDR: You can send $$ *to* Iran... Iranian buying your BTC can't send you $$ because no bilateral agreement in place. Also, local bank won't touch Rial / Tomen.

Not really though, we just get scammed or have our info stolen somewhere else down the pipeline. If you lose money the bank basically decides whether it's your fault or not based on how it happened and will reimburse you for the loss if you qualify. After that, the bank makes a claim to their insurance corp based on the size of loss. They always claim anything they can prove easily (to insurance) and the large losses but stuff below say $1000 gets ignored and written off.

Decentral is a cool spot. I picked up $3000 worth of bitcoin there last year in May, purchased from the bitcoin ATM.
 The machine was running a little low so the man in charge decided to offer a private transaction which went through very smoothly. I would recommend Decentral to anyone looking for a place to safely and comfortably buy bitcoin. The staff are friendly and the environment was cool. (Both literally and figuratively. It was hot outside that day, but the place was neat, tidy, clean and both kinds of cool.).

You're a trader, it all makes sense now. Hodlers don't trade, we invest and hodl. Investing means buying an asset and keeping it through downturns if you truly beleive in it and it's underlying potential, not speaking solely in terms of value or return. In fact many investors continue buying the asset even when value erodes in earnest. That's something even Warren "I don't get bitcoin" Buffet will tell you.  
  
I've done the whole trading thing and while I made gains initially, eventually mistakes caught up to me and I made compound losses. I could have stopped when I was ahead but many do not. By far, and many people even outside the sub will tell you, the easiest and most risk free way to gain profit is to buy and hodl. I'm glad you're making profit, hopefully you can continue to preserve it and earn more on top. It's very easy to lose quickly even with stop losses though and sometimes the market can run away on you VERY quickly. But you probably know that.

Again, you're making it seem like the ICO ends after the pre sale stage when in reality and according to many of the roadmaps of these startups they are still very much an ICO when trading at exchange level. While in the world of IPO stocks you might be correct, crypto and the term ICO are not limited to pre sale. The exchanges even list ERC20 tokens as 'ICO' tokens. If the company has nothing but promises to offer and has not materialized beyond the funding stage it's still very much consodered an ICO.

The insanity of Dec 2017 has warped your mind. In Sept 2017, $6k was unheard of. In Jan of 2017 $6k was a pipe dream. This is still considered massive growth. The movement caused by media hype surrounding the first break over $10k was the catalyst, along with insane amounts of inward velocity due to people chasing the ICO 'gold rush'. There was so much money floating through exchanges that offered ICO trading it caused a massive boom in the price of bitcoin. Everyone piled into bitcoin when the Vegeta meme and $10k caused the massive breakout. It was a confirmation bias.. A domino effect.

Are you under the assumption ATH is somehow a standard set in stone that must be reclaimed and held to cement value? It was clearly fluke events that led to ~$20k.. The fact you're using TA and trying to make assumptions about the future of bitcoin speaks volumes. Two of the largest faux pas in cryptocurrency. 
 The price was comfortable around $6k-$8k before anticipation of the Vegeta meme took hold and caused $9k Vegeta. The fact it went semi viral and hit front page helped it breach $10k, not manipulation via tether as many have claimed. $10k caused media hype induced FOMO and everyone on the sidelines including people riding the ICO wave jumped in. 
It was akin to the $1200+ Gox era high of 2013, which I witnessed in full from the rise to the epic crash and ~100% swings @ BTCe. 
 This is a typical retracement, a correction. ATH is not a relevant indicator of value or performance; especially when the majority of price action happened in a roughly 24h timeframe.

I'm aware of their settlement protocol, it's the majority of investors on the exchange end trying to pull assets extremely quickly that I'm worried about. If they can't honor deposits or have to sell a lot of assets to cover customer withdrawal requests they will hit the market hard in a bad way... As described in the article, loss of faith can mean more than just temporary damages to individuals or suffered as a whole. If the exchange goes bankrupt or cannot honor debts to their customers quickly enough... I mean you understand this is crypto and bad news travels. An exchange closure is never good. I'm sure they have an insurance policy but even allowing such behavior by the largest contract holder is irresponsible and negligent.

Whatever you define the exchange traded product to be - the added revenue of investors swelling into bitcoin exchanges and the fact that exchanges themselves are market makers means the addition of ICO tokens causes the exchange to 'swell'. The rapid influx of new capital for exchanges was largely conducted in bitcoin. It's the easiest and most universal pount of access to crypto markets. If people who had never heard or crypto before or were just getting into it learn of an ICO, do you really think they're even going to be capable (skilled enough) to purchase pre sale tokens?  
 Call them whatever you want but the sudden arrival of massive amounts of fresh USD capital into crypto will surely *always* cause a relevant bump in the price of bitcoin. The definition of the actual token / product is more or less an aside to the point.

Not sure who she is and I have never heard the podcast but I've been saying for a long time now that most of these exchanges are either fractional reserve or they are straight up manipulating books and numbers.

The proof is in trustworthy audits which should be mandatory one day if governments are going to allow exchanges to run on a fractional reserve system..

ERC20 is an ETH token but does not require ETH to purchase.. If individual ICOs were taking ETH at pre sale that's a totally different condition than claiming "ICOs require ETH". The creation of the token using ETH is irrelevant to the volume the token creates when it's traded actively on an open exchange. USDT is technically bitcoin by your definition then, because it's issued using coloured coins. The importance of what I said in my initial comment lies in the fact that the added patronage and revenue bump / the hype surrounding bitcoin trade at the apex of last years run to ATH was caused by the ICO fervor and the hundreds of billions of dollars that poured in to follow.  
 Even if the tether theory proves true, it was technically an altcoin (USDT) and a few walled garden exchanges that managed to push the market so far. It's telling when you consider the same thing happened with Gox in a way based on pure bitcoin - fiat speculation alone. The ATH of the Gox era could've been part of an exit scam by the thief(s) who stole from the exchange or exchange employees themselves as market makers fearing a collapse when word got out about the (Gox) situation.
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:13:22
The run to $19k was artificial and based on the shitload of ppl buying bitcoin to trade for some shitty ICO coin(s). That's why bitcoin dominance fell so hard last year, too many shitcoins and even with BTC getting pumped by the ppl using it to get shitcoins, there were still too many shitcoins to overcome (dominance). Now that the ICOs are all dying and getting banned and shit things are returning to normal. $6k is basically where it was before the ridiculous fuckery of last Dec.

It definitely caused ETH to spike. There's no doubt about that but I see the so called 'dumb' money being the real uptick to bitcoin reaching ATH. That's the hundreds of billions of dollars worth of USD to bitcoin moving through the exchanges causing massive generation of fees and new capital. The proof is in your conclusion, the growth in price of ETH ended abruptly while the rise in price of bitcoin to ATH was delayed. The few days that caused ~$19k were probably not part of this series of events but the run up to $10k and the further attention it caused. The price of bitcoin was around $6k highs when the majority of this 'ICO' money and crypto was coming in (to exchanges). The exchanges have the most interest in the price of bitcoin obviously.. They are not in it for the ICOs, only the revenue they generate. They are also however the most prolific of market makers. Again - see Gox.. The ultimate market maker of it's day.

Again, settlements are not what causes the bank run.. Irresponsible actions by the exchange causing losses means customers leave and withdrawal whatever holdings they have on exchange, that's the bank run. The action causing loss of faith has more or less to do with it than the actual event itself and it's consequences. If they can't fulfill demand they will begin doing what Poloniex is doing - freezing accounts and demanding the investors prove their identity further, stalling and taking long periods of time to respond to requests and tickets... This is not just about the liquidation at settlement. Damage can be far reaching into the actual exchange itself and if they have major issues.. It can have effects on the *whole* bitcoin market outside the exchange and futures market. FUD is already swirling and the price correction was swift.

One needs to ask themself how much trouble it would be worth to double spend successfully on a transaction small enough to be considered low risk. I mean maybe it might present a problem to a merchant or business being constantly scammed by 'customers' but for the average user / business this would be such a rare occurence I think it's a non issue. I understand the mechanics of how and why there *could* be potential to double spend but I think it would be less of a problem to bitcoin as a network than chargebacks and fraud are to say a credit network like VISA. Anyone taking a payment over a certain threshold would of course be advised to wait for a confirmation or two before accepting the transaction as complete but for a micropayment or someone buying say a pack of gum or eggs.. The average merchant loses more in shoplifting and shrink on any given day.

 If you can't see the threat a loss of faith causes to the investor base of the exchange you're blind, deaf and dumb in the sense of exchange operation. The consequences of such culminating in the worst case a large scale exodus impacting the market price as the exchange itself works to cover the spread.  
I'll make it simple for you to understand: Angry customers leave and take their money with them. If the exchange is a fractional reserve model they will default *VERY* quickly should they happen to be unable to cover customer / investor withdrawal requests. If they have an uneven spread (exchange owns a lot of bitcoin but has low cash reserve) they must sell assets (bitcoin) on the open market to cover the customers who wish to exit via other means. If they do this rapidly the market price can drop on illiquid bitcoin / USD volumes globally..

Being an ERC20 token doesn't automatically mean it's going to be an ETH - ERC20 exchange nor a fiat - ERC20 exchange. The majority of investors had already been bitcoin owners or were actively holding or trading at the time. Regardless of the means of onramp the main benefactors of these trades of any currency into an ERC20 token are the exchanges acting as host to them. The increase in business and the boom that followed in bitcoin price were causal. I doubt the USDT theory is correct because the unicorn prices of a single exchange should not impact the entire ecosystem. A closed garden has no effect on the outside world without collusion from the forces beyond their wall. Unless it's a planetary size one like Gox was but that was a much more vulnerable time in crypto history.

That's what the neighborhood dealer is for. As far as selling to 'kids' goes only the dirtiest scumbag would sell to a child, whereas teens whether one considers them 'children' or not are known to experiment with drugs as a demographic. A dealer who actually does sell to kids is not accepted by general society or the law obviously, but even within ranks of criminality. A gang on the street or in prison would murder someone they knew was selling to actual children. They do exist but are few and far between. Even most criminals have a conscience. This is why child molesters are regularly murdered in prison and must be kept separate from the general prisoner population. It's almost a self regulating industry.

That makes little sense, the majority of price activity can *only* occur on an exchange. Are you assuming or trying to say that once the pre sale is complete that's where the ICO ends? How do you think the valuation changes? The investors who bought tokens to profit can only sell at exchange level or private sale (good luck). A huge number of these ICOs, the majority actually, were just veiled altcoins based on ERC20 with big promises attached to them. The majority were either scams or failed projects within months of release to public sale.

A trustworthy USD peg crypto backed by actual USD. Not sure if you understand how many hoops someone must jump through to send a bank wire but this will mean basically if you have a circle account you can I am assuming turn any of the crypto in your circle wallet into this USD coin and then send it as crypto. Why is this important? Until now tether has been the only 'stable' crypto alternative to USD. The benefit of crypto itself is sidelined by the near universal volitility of basically every token in the space with at least marginal velocity. This new USD token will be trustworthy and stable and provide all the utility of crypto without having the worry of volitity. If it's used heavily it will help lower wait times to fund accounts at exchanges and offer the entire world the promises of fast, cheap and secure transfers which crypto offer that the traditional banking sector could not (until now or in the near future a la circle and Goldman Sachs). 
 The only problem per se is that it's a centralized token like an ICO. It's bank coin.

If you get robbed at gunpoint for cryptocurrency that's obviously a crime and unfortunate, but you are not supposed to have all your money in crypto. I agree, that would be dangerous for someone in a high crime area or with little to no police support. There are plenty of counter measures anyone can take to protect themselves. You can keep your holdings private (secret) and use hot wallets if you choose to use any of it as a day to day currency. If someone robs you at gunpoint you can lie and send them whatever you have in a hot spending wallet. If they are not going to harm you for only having some cash this is no different.  
 It actually is accessible to *EVERYONE* on earth and you do not need an internet connection to access the bitcoin network. It cannot be stopped or blocked. You can create an offline wallet and other people can send coin to your wallet even if you have no internet access. There are currently satellites in orbit broadcasting the network publicly for free and you can sign transactions offline then upload them when you have access to the network. In the future it can become more ubiquitous than public utilites like electricity and water. It is *globally* accessible by anyone.  
  Obviously villages in West Africa need to be introduced to technology slowly and gradually but the principle of ownership and use of crypto can again, benefit these people massively. Your personal opinion does not negate that. Custodial holding by trusted members of the community or entrepreneurs could provide defacto banks to  these villages by that standard alone. Nobody is saying any of this can nor will happen overnight but they are indeed possible. Africa already has MPESA and cryptocurency is much better for many reasons. In fact cryptocurrency use in many African countries is rising dramatically.

Depends on how one interprets the concept of ownership - legally speaking and by definition you can certainly own something and rely on others to hold, protect and control it. The absolute nature of a bitcoin transaction once confirmed definitely means anyone and everyone capable of securing their own keys *should* be doing that but obviously that's not going to be the case for a huge number of people whether you or I like it or not.. There are people who simply can't or won't. There are banks who will offer products that will sell like hotcakes as long as they contain the word bitcoin in any capacity. Once a mainstream singularity is achieved it will be the majority way of doing business - custodial ownership; which solves *some* problems certain people might have with bitcoin ownership but also introduces other new problems.. Potential for denial of access to your funds and oversight of your asset(s) in holding etc..

If you open a store front and invite anyone and everyone to sell narcotics anonymously without refrain, skimming fees off every sale then you are running a criminal enterprise and are complicit and implicated in any ill the enterprise facilitates. You can flout your opinion about it all you want, luckily for the rest of us we live in a modern structured society that pursues and apprehends said criminals. Accessibility to kids is only *one* reason this type of shit will never be accepted by society and will be actively persecuted and dismantled on a case by case basis.

Shorting will not continue to depress prices for long if demand continues to rise... If the short is cash settled it has no impact on price once sentiment is driven out and overrun by real demand. If the short is asset based then the individual selling the contract will eventually run out of bitcoin to sell on short contracts. When scarcity begins making it literally impossible to find large sums of coin readily for sale (not the fractional reserve IOU of exchanges or hosted wallets) these short contracts - real or imagined (cash settled / exchange IOU = not your coin, especially with exchanges) will be at the mercy of actual (bitcoin) prices. Currently I beleive the opposite is true.. The 'shorts' and FUD are impacting (bitcoin) prices..

We could go back and forth with this all day. If you plan on storing something generally it's understood to be long term. In the short term there are obviously much more stable alternatives but historically speaking nothing has ever come close to being as powerful a long term investment as bitcoin. In the frame of reference it has only ever outperformed ever other asset. It has *always* been high risk but that does not mean it has not been an excellent store of value year over year for the majority of it's existence. More so in terms of calendar years than fiscal but all the same..

That's been my point the whole time, bitcoin isn't and never was intended to be completely anon. Being immutable has nothing to do with breaking laws or facilitating that sort of activity. It means if I send bitcoin to a bitcoin address it will get there guaranteed so long as I place the correct fee. Nothing can stop it once the transfer has completed. Nobody controls my bitcoin unless I allow it. In terms of digital assets this is a first, and changes everything completely. The very defenition of money is at stake and changing rapidly.

I think it might imply there was a speculative boost to the price leading up to the conference and the money has retracted on shaky feelings that the conference was poorly planned and mishandled. A lot of investors expected the conference itself to cause a boost but it was those expectations themselves that pushed the market price up. As the article stated the perceived boost *usually* comes in the weeks and months after the conference. So basically the hype of a potential rise due to consensus caused a real increase and those investors are pulling out because they *think* the conference was a disaster. It was almost a placebo effect in a metaphorical sense. Maybe we are seeing natural sell pressure (would have been there with or without the existence of consensus) and the hype of the conference was the only thing propping prices up.

In terms of accessibility to my own assets and the freedom that access allows me it's crucial to omit third party handlers to completely remove the possibility of mishandling or denial of services. This access alone should be a fundamental right. In countries where the government is not in control or there literally is no government (Libya) being able to personally control assets digitally would offer protection from any manner of ill loss. In places where banks practically do not exist (villages in West Africa or rural farm regions in South China) a viable crypto means the difference between being banked or not at all. These are only a few obscure examples of why a functioning decentral public asset on a blockchain (ledger) is invaluable.

That's the point, if you want complete anonymity you use something other than bitcoin even if that means using said anon chain as your primary transactional chain. Bitcoin doesn't need to be anonymous anymore - the majority of users are not darknet sellers or buyers and thus most of us don't care about anonymous transactions. It's just not necessary for bitcoin.

Nope, central reserve banks are not legally allowed to provide lender of last resort coverage on anything except fiat they produce themselves or underwritten contracts based on that fiat. You will *never* see legal fractional reserve bitcoin banking. Maybe with a FED coin but anybody even commenting in this sub should already know that isn't really cryptocurrency. 
And FDIC is mandatory for any bank making loans based on customer reserves held in their custody or the custody of the central bank providing the (commercial bank) coverage. Since FDIC valued in crypto (not fiat) isn't possible, there thus cannot be a bitcoin fractional reserve of any sort whatsoever .

Exactly. Reserves in USD being inflationary fiat are not only held by the commercial bank itself but insured by the central bank in accounts registered to the commercial bank acting as a fractional reserve. FDIC is impossible with crypto reserves because the central bank cannot provide any support at all for a currency they do not control the creation of (new supply). Without FDIC, fractional reserves offered to commercial bank customers are not possible or legal. The only reason fractional reserve banking is even possible is because the central bank can and does guarantee the money supply of both hard currency and underwritten loans in all forms which the commercial bank writes to it's customers.. 
 The individual claiming the bitcoin supply can be inflated has no idea what they are talking about. It's literally only possible with inflationary fiat money controlled by (the) central bank providing oversight to a commercial bank.. As lender of last resort the central bank can *only* provide oversight to fiat currencies because they control (fiat).

A lot of people did that when it hit $1200 in 2013. Investing is believing, not buying for a quick buck. Warren Buffet although he dislikes crypto and has weird ideas and habits to do with technology, actually advocates buying more of any given asset when it's 'crashing' (if you believe in the asset and it's worth.).. At the very least if they truly believe in the investment then selling at a loss makes little sense. It goes without saying only invest what you are willing to lose. 
If they're considering themself a trader then yeah, holding from 18k down to 6k makes them a terrible trader. But most of us are not trading, just buying as an investment. 'Hodl' itself is very symbolic for that reason.

It's seriously amazing and amusing that you still don't get this.. The average customer doesn't care *why* the clawback occurs. They only care about their investment and the profit it generates. To pay for the mistakes of a wealthy fool because the exchange allowed that person to leverage a nearly half a billion USD futures bet is unacceptable. The exchange is very much to blame and customers who choose to leave take their money and / or crypto out of the exchange. If the exchange is running books based on a fractional reserve system and they can't cover customer withdrawal requests eventually they must stop honoring the requests or go into default. This could have been catastrophic for the exchange and potentially the bitcoin market if they had to sell assets to cover debts quickly. Same effect as the Mt Gox trustee coin sale if the exchange goes bust on wonky books.

Nah, if the world falls apart the Americans have all the firepower. They are a massive target too but as long as a potential WW3 is non-nuclear they will survive and come out on top. The Americas are a giant island of aligned forces... Literally the most indestructable bastion of so called 'freedom' in the world. That goes back to the war of independance and the fact that an expeditionary war against an enemy force with a massive home advantage is nary impossible. The smallest and seemingly easiest to overcome countries become overpowering fortresses when given that sort of advantage. Look how powerful Germany and Japan, two very small countries became when they had the advantage of home ground.  
 There are only two ways to defeat such an advantage. You can overcome this enemy with pure brute strength, using technology and numbers, tactics and the necessary time it will take to grind them down. Or you divide and conquer. You break their civil will to wage war as what happened to the Americans during the late stages of 'nam and Nixon's failures and fuckups or make them fight multiple fronts until the weakest links fail a la the defeat of the Afrika Korps or the USMC island hopping campaign against Japan.  
 My point being no matter what happens the elitists in the US and their friends in Europe will never lose control. Humanity will end before the most powerful people on this planet lose their grip on society. That is not to say we are all doomed or we can't live great fulfilling lives while we're here. It just means your aspirations to change the power vacuum even as a whole community will never bear fruit. If there truly is a serious threat posed to current order on any level by cryptocurrency or decentralizing all the things, someone in some ivory tower somewhere worth tens of billions of dollars is already in majority control of it. Thus the power might shift slightly and a few dinosaurs might die, fall out of the loop or lose themselves in their mistakes (of casting doubt or non participation in cryptocurrency) but no matter what someone or ones will always hold the keys.  
 
 The problem with society is not money alone. Power, corruption and greed are terms thrown around a lot lately, often all together as I've just written.. And maybe for good reason. But there will never be a reversal of roles. Powerful families remain powerful for a reason, even civil unrest and the complete change of power or rulers cannot change that. Elites and their extended groups of friends and families will always be able to overpower commoners.

As long as it's stable we have society. When inflation becomes rampant you have serious problems and when the supply dries up the elite corner all markets and the average people refuse to spend outside necessities. A stable form of currency is actually the only thing holding society together right now. Every government on earth is thankful that USD exists in it's current form, even the ones that supposedly hate America and capitalism. The powerful ex-communist bastions are now more open than ever.. Look at how close Trump is to opening proper trade with China. I don't like the guy much and don't particularly support his regime but this is amazing. History is being written if American foreign interest is allowed to purchase and own stake in Chinese corporations. This is unprecedented. The Chinese are actually embracing America in ways they never have. Even if the trade deals fall apart he would have been closer than anyone ever has. 
 The world needs a stable fiat currency *right now* more than ever. If it were not USD it would need to be *something* and definitely not deflationary.

In the legal sense all that needs to be satisfied is burden of proof. A government will recognize court decisions based on that and anyone found to be in contention of the law is subject to the actions and punishments of law enforcement. If you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that you own the coins associated to a certain address then you are protected to whatever extent your government / bitcoin custodian / insurer will cover. The concept of ownership does not work without proof in the form of a trusted registry that (the majority of) people and organisations reference to obtain the information of what belongs to who. That's why credit networks are possible in the first place. So to actually prove owneship of bitcoin in a *legal* reference you need to follow certain paths and procedures to ensure you have a trustworthy custodian (like an exchange with KYC /AML) which provides court credible witness evidence to support any claim of ownership you might have to or want to make in the future. 
 
 In terms of what constitutes the ideological 'ownership' of the balance of an address... That's more of a moral concern. Your ownership of anything physical or digital inherently relies on who recognizes that you own it legally or otherwise. Just because the ledger is public does not mean it isn't covered by the same property rights whether civil / legal justice is concerned *and* on moral grounds. You can rob a private ledger (bank / VISA) by hacking into the system controlling it and maliciously changing inputs.. This is virtually the same.

Same ownership rights as property. If I drop my gold by accident and you find it you don't automatically own it. Finders keepers is not going to fly in respect to property laws and the justice system. Proving ownership however can be difficult. That's why insurance companies and banks offer protection by documenting your ownership of an insured item and buying you a new one if something bad happens to it or paying you the value of your loss. That's part of why FDIC makes saving money in a bank an attractive proposition for someone not looking to invest it. The reason most 'savings' accounts offer ~2% interest is to convince the person depositing money that their funds are not only secure with the bank but earning enough compound interest to shield the customer from the effects of inflation, as long as inflation remains stable.  
 Which brings us to the reasoning as to why a bitcoin bank is a good idea for a lot of ordinary people. If the bank insures your bitcoin deposit and protects it by documenting it's existance and that you are the declared owner. If it's stolen already (by you) that complicates things but people launder money through banks too so this is not a new problem. When you own bitcoin you literally are your own bank unless you let someone else protect it for you, but you need to trust the entity protecting it too.

 If you're buying to hodl you should learn how to secure your own keys and keep them in a hardware wallet or strong offline cold storage. A lot of people will tell you never leave it in an exchange but many will say it has advantages too. It's all perspective. If you really want in like *now* just go ahead and start the process of opening an exchange account because it can be a lengthy process but worth it if you want custodial storage and ability to sell and trade quickly during rapid price movements. Otherwise you could find a  reasonably low fee bitcoin ATM or use Localbitcoins or other OTC markets and just hold it in your own wallet.

Again, it's the only crypto with real support and use. There is nowhere to spend alts aside from random places and unless it's a top 5 alt it is difficult to find on multiple exchanges even if it does have support. I mean if you want a metaphor Bitcoin is like Coca Cola and alts are random soda brands from China that you have never heard of. Literally. Coke is sold allover the world. You can sell it as a beverage anywhere because it's recognizable and bought (used) in mass volume. Bitcoin has the same mass appeal.  
 
 It's the only crypto accepted widely by merchants and the largest gateway to the alts. It's also considered a store of value.

No, we should find and dismantle terrorist organisations and try to limit and control funding of them via crypto or any other pathway for that matter. And I know it's easy to say that but there is most definitely a worldwide hate against terrorism and extremism globally, so the funding and access of these groups is already limited as it is. It's not possible to eradicate terrorism completely but society must try anyway and so it does. We don't all just say fuckit this is impossible and give up, which is basically what you're implying we should do. Children should be supervised in general, yes, but that in no way shape or form impacts our willingness to fight terrorism or similarly the unfettered, unrestricted and anonymous online purchase / sale of literally any drug controlled or otherwise.

Bruh when I say 99% I am talking about the number of people who even really look at the ad and check the site, of that 99% the number of people who will actually use the exchange will likely be below 1% so realistically speaking let's say on any given day less than 0.1% of anyone who sees it *might* use the exchange. You are assuming a lot of people will even care enough to look at it and consciously engage the graphic to begin with. Most people see and hear a Lambo and get excited but could care less about the paint or graphic. For a recognizable brand like Coca Cola this might have an impact but for Einstein exchange it's just a poorly executed publicity stunt. Whether the person who owns it (Lambo) has ownership stake in the exchange or not, the investment could be much better spent on ads elsewhere. 
 If however the owner spent his personal funds on the car and graphic just to self promote his brand, the loss or gain is personal and in that case it might make sense...

Yes I understand that but the seller is always the one who must report income. The only thing missing is a standard system of calculation and reporting so far.
 Doesn't matter whether you are selling a bitcoin for cash or using the bitcoin itself to buy items from a merchant or pay for services, the person selling the object is the one whom onus is on to report the income for tax purposes. The appreciation of a sold bitcoin is also taxable but when you are trading a bitcoin for a good or a service deflationary rise in the value of a bitcoin as a medium of exchange is absolutely nil. Its the equivalent of the US dollar gaining 5% , ( or 50% ) overnight, and you purchasing milk for whatever market rate is vs a US dollar. Even if the milk is sold to you without an adjusted rate, the gain in value of that dollar is not taxable against someone holding the dollar the day before.
 Therefore if a bitcoin rises in value 500% overnight and you make a purchase with the bitcoin at an adjusted or NON-adjusted rate, the only person whom has onus to report tax is the seller of the good or service receiving the bitcoin as payment. Standard or barter sales tax apply..
@_date: 2018-05-09 20:47:38
Doesn't matter, eventually people realize where the bad shit is coming from and avoid it. Sometimes the 'bad' dealer is caught by authorities or killed by rivals / as revenge or whatever. With total anonymity even if the trail leads to a seller they can disappear and return under a different identity if they are not operating multiple to begin with. Similarly an anon review system will not catch the dealer selling fakes if the fakes are mass killing his customers. They can't write a review and the people next in line will never be the wiser. At least putting a name and a face on a bad actor cannot be undone by simply starting a new account and rebuilding feedback - which can easily be faked and manipulated anyway.

Actually yes. Children under say 13 will generally be off limits. Gangs self regulate and target people who break rules whether you are a member of the gang, a rival gang or not a gang member at all. Aside from that the average person may overlook a dealer selling to adults in their neighbor(hood) but if that someone is selling to children that person is effectively outcast on a persnal level from their community. Police will act with extra pregidous against such a dealer and even other criminals in prison will target them if word gets out. You might as well be a child murderer or child rapist if you sell any sort of narcotic to a child.

I'm not as much supportive of the government as I am understanding that this is basically how things have become and without some sort of overnight flash civil war or actual WW3 scenario, nothing can change. Watching Trump take office was terrifying enough, now he's fragging trade deals and making friends with dictators while he steps on the toes of their friends.. It's practically Nixon 2016. I am not part of the warband nor a hippie protesting it. I try to look at everything with balanced contrast. I might not like how things are but I am in no way standing by either extreme. I prefer to attempt to understand why from every point of view with an almost empathetic outlook. I was actually a silkroad user once upon a time. 
  
 As for the post, yes, many societies are working toward cashlessness as a way to (attempt) to gain more insight, oversight and control of peoples finances. They would all love us to use plastic over cash. This is nothing new though. I know a guy who still has a stack of $1000 USD bills. For a long time after they stopped being legal tender they were still used and traded between cartels and the major gangs and mafia. I don't think they are used much anymore by criminals but when they were 'circulating' out of circulation the criminals couldn't ever even dream of trading them for clean cash or assets outside laundering it. Why did they use those bills if they couldn't trade them legitimately? Aside from being easy to carry, they were worth just as much to those closed societies as when they were legal tender.  
 The governments and central banks are just afraid they are being closed out of general society. If they control the only access points and have eyes literally everywhere they can't be shut out. It's no lie when they say they are clamping down on money laundering and corruption though. Their ability to monitor our every move is just a convenient side effect. Crypto is basically Neo at the end of the Matrix. The last scene when he tells the architect over the phone that he is about to turn their shit upside down then blasts off out of there like Superman to Rage Against the Machine.

What the fuck are you talking about, cynical is assuming it's actually important and necessary to the extent it's pursued and sought after. The actual market price has more to do with the cost of mining than real demand or usage. If gold was truly scarce and there was a possibility that industrial uses would completely deplete reserves any time soon it woud be far more valuable and jewelry made of it uncommon, like platinum ore. Even platinum is relatively abundant though, as are diamonds. The industry is not as saturated as oil or gas so the price is much more reflective of the material and labor costs of mining than supply and demand. Demand is still not incredible but industrial uses take a back seat to jewelry so it's pretty clear we have more gold than we *need* as a global society. If all countries were equal and consumed the same amount of gold for industry it might be different but the world is very uneven in that sense.

The problem is you're questioning what implies ownership on a personal individual level. It's pretty clear there are recognized laws to protect information and data.. You cannot for instance lie and pretend to be me using my personal information without breaking information security laws. You can try to use my social insurance number if you know the numbers, *but that does not make it yours*. Ownership is defined in more than one sense. You can own digital rights to a song which is just noise, encoded digitally. Literally. So to claim ownership cannot be applied to digital information is nonsensical.

Whether that's true or not, real institutional level buying is going to proliferate soon. Eventually liquidity on the bitcoin side will dry up and supply will be extremely limited but demand will continue to grow. That's why there are 100 million satoshi in a single bitcoin. If bitcoin becomes massively successful there no reason why a satoshi cannot be worth a US penny or more. As it stands with Lightning Network already active, a satoshi is infinitely more useful than a penny. What can you do with a penny? Nothing you do with it will be worth the time and energy cost. Not even melting it unless you have a few dozen pounds of them to melt but even then there is no copper in them anyway and the fuel to melt them will cost more than the scrap value is worth. 100+ satoshi for a penny is a damn good deal.

Their FAQ is a little obscure and doesn't really mention any specific countries other than ghana lol , heres the info : 
 Can we ship to your country?
 
Our web-store is primarily intended to service the needs of Canadians who aren't close enough to us for a convenient in-store visit, but we are happy to try to help folks who are outside of Canada as well. We will not ship anything anywhere where the item is forbidden or otherwise could create a problem for us. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone or any country as we so choose (please don't bother asking us to ship to Ghana for example). If we are unable to ship to you, we will refund any payment and inform you as soon as possible. If we CAN ship to you outside of Canada, your shipping charges may have to be sorted out (any amount we have to pay over and above what the web-store calculates for you, we will have to add as a separate charge - we will never intentionally charge substantially more than the shipper charges us).

You can trade things for bitcoin or work and earn bitcoin. Villages in West Africa could provide unskilled labor and sell anything they can make to earn a little and help the entire village start out. Charities could educate and help unbanked people start out with some seed satoshis. As someone else mentioned, MPESA exists so this is not going to be as difficult as it seems.

Wow you really do think the most important caveat is anonymity don't you.. Satoshi Nakamoto himself declared anonymity was not specifically important to bitcoin. The immutable aspect comes from it's statelessness and the fact that bitcoin sent to a bitcoin address will be delivered without input from anyone except the user and miner he is paying to include his or her transaction in a block. The decentral aspect is thus that no central authority can command over an individuals bitcoin, protected mathematically by the alogrithm and the consensus of nodes.. The guarantee of volume comes from the fact that it is the most widely used, accepted and developed blockchain with the most all around support. It is literally used as a reserve currency for all the alts..  
   
 The least important aspect of the Bitcoin network is anonymity. Time has proven so and will continue to. 99% of all participants are not interested in nor do they require anonymity in their transactions *at any level* whatsoever.

Dude who sold defective airbags broke laws and goes to prison re: modern society.. The unsuspecting victim who died as a result of his illegal sale of an unsafe car has no recourse.. Unacceptable actions have consequences. The only variable is the person committing said crimes. Responsibility is shared and trust is leveraged in all aspects of any transaction. Bad actors are recognized and weeded out. It doesn't make any of what they did okay or acceptable nor does their failure to get away with their crime somehow shift responsibility onto the buyer or their guardian...

Techically it already is in many ways.. Money laundering is illegal in all countries and using anonymous crypto doesn't somehow make it legal. People use Monero for that reason. Did you think the most important part of Bitcoin was anonymity? It never really was. If someone does not want to provide you service you shouldn't be trying to trick them into it or bypassing their ability to stop you anyway. If you need to though you can use an anon chain. Bitcoin will never be fully anonymous without sidechains and at that point you honestly might as well just use a full blown purpose built anon chain. 
 The benefit right now is a near flawlessly operating decentral p2p token exchange system. The first and most trusted of it's kind. The only one with guaranteed organic volume and velocity.

It's more like there is no such thing as stability in a country like Libya. Being robbed is one small personal fear that having a safe or a stash can mitigate.. Much more worrisome is the lack of a central authority to control the stability of the economy through proper inflationary measures and taxation. Without these pillars you have no society and chaos is rampant. Stable money is really important to maintaining order.. Ideally you need a slowly inflating fiat money to spend and a deflationary decentralized public money to support sustained growth and promote savings and building toward retirement. For centuries we have existed *without* both but things have progressed too far to do away with the inflation model, and up until recently the deflationary model did not exist outside of theory or ideology. The founder(s) of Liberty Reserve tried to create a stateless money but were thrown under the full weight of the United States justice system because their network was technically 'private' and they were knowingly complicit in money laundering.. The US justice system has no power over bitcoin transactions though aside from pursuing criminals who have used it to commit crime. That says a lot. Nobody can say "no" or stop your transaction. It's more or less up to you to protect your identity or the fact that you own bitcoin, just like cash. But I would much rather have a brainwallet / seed that nobody knows about than money in a state run or private bank if I were in a shithole like Libya. It's certainly safer than carrying money or gold in such a place. Even having significant amounts of gold or money in Libya would be dangerous as a private citizen.

Paying the fee itself is impressive though. But I digress, buying gum is kinda cool and I guess relative to my next point, you can own gum obviously but.. A satoshi is digital property / money that you actually own. *You* own it. Money is government property and you have certain rights over your personal holdings but those rights are insofar superceded universally by the backing government and their rights over said money. With bitcoin, not so much. And you can't really ask "What can x number of satoshi do that x number of dollars can't?", because that's a rhetorical question which relies solely on bitcoin market price alone.

Advertising and data harvesting by third parties doesn't bother me at all, the very nature of society is shifting and having a digital fingerprint is impossible to avoid. It's warped individuals like yourself to blame for perpetuating the falsehood that anonymity is an almighty and important facet to being a functioning member of society. In reality you actually can't function anonymously whatsoever unless you have an extensive support system wherein other people are doing literally everything for you, similar to what Osama Bin Laden or Joaquin Guzman had to accomplish. I am talking about owning the payroll of people on levels of corruption unheard of in modern society. The fact is a law abiding and functioning member of any society *literally* cannot survive in the current world without being on a galaxy of registry databases both public and private since the day they were born. You're the oblivious one to think any level of anonymity is achievable for the average person in the first place. If a first world nation government agency or Google want to know everything about you the only way to evade them is to have been born into a tribal society with a self governing regional structure. That's why religious radical extremists in Pakistan are often extremely hard to track... Anyone born in a hospital is automatically on a list though obviously. Nobody is disputing the existence of 'lists' (registry databases). 
 You seem to to be confusing my declaration that they largely do not matter for some sort of lack of awareness in regard to said databases.. Which is actually directly contradicted within the text of the comment you replied to. Some kind of false conjecture when I clearly mentioned that even if you end up on lists, unless you are a criminal or terrorist it doesn't really matter to the average person. We already have a galaxy of stops in place to protect people from the effects of identity theft and fraud so unless you are a criminal I say again; anonymity is not even a factor in the lives of the average individual. If you aren't breaking laws you have nothing to worry about plain and simple. Unless you're for some reason afraid of targeted ads or third party data collection which makes you not only paranoid but *stupid* in so many ways.

Only the lowest level of scum attempt to run their business unrestricted. They are oft junkies themselves or hardened lone wolf types and they never fare well, not even among their own kind.

What are you not getting here? This is apalling and hilarious fr. Did you even read the article? The whole point of my initial comment had everything to do with the failure scenario in which the guarantor system itself spread losses and the exchange ends up losing (mass) customers as a result. I will ask you again, *do you even get what a bank run is?*... It's like you literally didn't read the article or you're ignoring the context. Do you understand what happens to a fractional reserve in the event of a bank run?  Exchanges can go bankrupt very quickly if they cannot balance the ratio of inflow / outflow or maintain assets. If the price doesn't rise by liquidation there will be a mass exodus and likely the exhange defaults unless it has assets near to or greater than customer deposits.

Anon transactions are not required for the majority of users. Decentral p2p assets in general do not exist outside crypto. If you can't see why an immutable stateless form of money is valuable that's your shortcoming, not anyone elses.

It's not important and for a while most of us thought bitcoin actually was fully anon, hence the darknet black market bazaar run by a kid and a shitload of tech savvy drug dealers / users. But yeah, it's not really a make or break feature of (any) blockchain unless that blockchain makes a specific point of being anonymous. The fact that bitcoin is not fully anonymous itself was discovered years ago yet we still see mass use and volume.

You don't need to collect that data in regular cash purchases because it is already collected on the sale itself by the seller. Unless it is a private sale, but the onus is still always on those selling goods to receive ( money ). Add the income tax already payed on the money in hand being used for the purchase and you find your actual dollar doesn't go nearly as far as the friendly banks and govts would like you to think...
 The same applies to bitcoin, it's just there is more responsibility in the hands of buyer and seller...

You should really figure out whether you want to let Coinbase be custodian of your bitcoin vs being your own bank and holding your keys.

I've never had a problem but some people have told me to get a hardware wallet / offline generated keys or such.  
 As for Coinbase I'm no expert, but people do complain about service during serious price movements along with their response times or lack of response to support tickets during high volume periods.

That would be stupid no doubt. But if you have ten million in assets producing income it more or less becomes a question of how much enjoyment can this vehicle bring me over the void of said enjoyment I would suffer by not buying a Lambo (if it's really that important to me) vs the perceived loss of value I would suffer as it depreciates. Matters become even more complicated if we bring sentimentality and one's potential desire to keep the car if they buy it into play, because a lot of people would simply say renting or leasing is a better option. It might be for someone who sees the car as a disposable fun toy of sorts but there are a huge number of people who also feel a passion towards cars and might be trying to attain their grail. If it's a limited edition or a sought after model you might even be able to flip it for significantly more money as was the case with the Challenger Hellcat for months after they first released for public sale. Or contrary to that you can find cars like the Carerra 911 R which was sold only to select clients and measures are put in place to identify whether owners are using their vehicle or holding it for future resale or a flip. Porsche has made it clear if they catch an owner who purchased the car brand new from the recipient list selling it for profit they will be denied the access to purchase any and all future limited edition models new from Porsche and it's dealer network. It's an invitation only sort of thing like the Ferrari Enzo and more recently the Ford GT.

At this point you are just playing with semantics. Unfortunately you seem to have a sixth grade understanding of what you are writing. The very word 'synonymous' most accurately describes the relationship that the Bitcoin network holds with the underlying technology the protocol facilitates. Just as you cannot say a Mercedes C350 is not a car, because it is. You cannot say the Bitcoin network and protocol are not open ledger technology, because they are. Just as a 'processor' chip is the most literal and physical manifestation of processor technology in computing, as is the Bitcoin network to open ledger technology.

This is how big banks and funds operate though. During accumulation phases (none of the big brokerages have opened cryptocurrency exchanges yet) they will actively try to supress the market price for obvious reasons. With the amount of leverage and capital these giants control along with the fact that exchanges like Coinbase / GDAX are likely in bed with them... This is bound to persist until the floating supply starts drying up. Since Coinbase is a market maker and many people use bots to trade the price is not entirely difficult to manipulate for a Goldman Sachs or NYSE level participant. I suspect it's only a matter of time before the dam breaks and the flood of capital overcomes all negative price action. This can only happen when the major players entering the space have acquired what they need to run their operation(s).

You can muddle with semantics all you want. The 7.62x51 mm round was replaced for a reason. It's considered battle rifle ammunition, used in weapons like the FN FAL and the Springfield M14. The devastation seen in wounds from some of the first examples of the 5.56x45 mm ( 55 grain m193 round ) were considered to be 'inhumane'. They would yaw on impact with the target and cause hydrostatic shock beyond what the US military was seeking. For this very reason they opted to field the Belgian developed 62 grain SS109 round. The reason being the US military had a specific requirement that the round penetrate one side of a steel helmet at 600 meter range. The design of the round SS109 itself is much less capable of fragmentation than the M193 and therefore considered more humane. The effect of fragmentation on impact has a lot more to do with velocity than it does with anything else like weight or kinetic 'energy'. 
The article you used as a reference cites the SAS and their specific opinion of the round but fails to mention they are using this round almost exclusively in short barrel CQB style weapons like the M4 or the SA80. Shorter barrels provide significantly lower velocity than a long barrel with which this round was designed for. Therefore it would make sense for the SAS to convert to a larger round with more weight and lower velocity since they are essentially a covert operations and rapid deployment force and mostly prefer carbine rifles or even SMG's to full size battle rifles or long barrel assault rifles. Maybe if you had read Bravo Two Zero or Immediate Action you might have understood that and produced a more intelligent response.
 Keep coming with these replies though, I am enjoying this.

I am not going to say you are outright wrong, but at this point the infrastructure is already proliferating beyond the expectation of many who felt a similar stance at the beginning of last year, prior to the first peak at $266. The comparisons being made to the internet of 1994 or the early era stock markets are roughly in line with the standpoint I am trying to convey. That the technology in and of itself is really the point of value and whether monetary deflation keeps the price rising or not is subsequent.
 Private ownership of the units of exhange in a global distributed digital ledger equates to a technical leap the size of putting a man on the moon in terms of handling money and assets. There was never a way to do it without a middle man that charged for their service and controlled everything from behind a curtain. The real jewel is the fact that we have a proven system of trust based holding and exchange, worldwide, in a world that is still by and large growing to use the internet itself as a whole. The majority of people on this planet are un-banked and do not have a cellphone or access to the internet. When the internet proliferates far enough into cultures it has yet to impact we shall see the true value of a privately held and trusted asset on a public , open source, globally distributed ledger.

I really enjoyed your post here, but you started a sentence with 'Because'. And unfortunately , in English , you are never supposed to start a sentence with 'because'. ...
You also fail to grasp the common fact that in economics it does not matter what an individual values their holding at. It is the MAJORITY census that ends up giving this object value. No matter what YOU think, there MUST be at LEAST one person willing to value your object at the same level that you are placing onto it. Without this , economics is just a guessing game of he said , she said,. Commodity prices are what they are because there is a legitimate need for said commodity, and a market full of willing participants whom trade it. Not just because you place imaginary 'value' on it.

It's actually a public ledger system and the coins itself are just units of exchange... Valuation is only based on market demand which right now is around $433...

All I am saying is the US Army has been trying to find something better for 50 years and they still haven't decided anything is much better. They still field 7.62x51 mm but it is mainly used as a designated marksman rifle or a light sniper round as opposed to a pure assault rifle. Of course , when you have a squad size force there will likely be at least a designated marksman if not a sniper amongst them, and depending on the mission they are tasked with there should also be a light machine gun and a mix of close and medium range assault rifles present. Results may vary.
 I understand your personal choice and I am not saying you are wrong. I would certainly want to be able to put a bigger hole in a target if I could, but there are always benefits to both sides of the situation. If you have more ammo, and a long ( 20 inch ) barrel, an M16 usually does the job for the jack of all trades role. When the infantry need more firepower they just call up the sniper / marksman if he isn't already engaging the threat(s) since it is his job to find them first anyway.. But sometimes even the marksman is equipped with a 5.56 mm round or a .223 Remington. Albeit the cartridge will be larger and meant for engaging a target at longer distances, heavier and possibly with a hot powder load as opposed to a normal cartridge.
 To each his own I guess..

Your money is government property. You have some rights in relation to it but you do not own it. When you hold bitcoin you own it. *You* own it. Nobody can stop or roll back your transaction. Guess what? If your bank has a problem with you or someone you are sending your money to, they can stop you from sending the money or accessing it at all.  
 All fiat money you 'own' is inflating at a guaranteed (minimum) rate thus always loses value. It is a terrible store of value by nature. Cryptocurrency like bitcoin can be limited and therefore deflationary by principle. This means there's a reasonable chance that if bitcoin continues to see widespread exponential rises in adoption and growth it has the ability to be a strong store of value and even an investment. It does come with great risk as it's an unprecedented and never before seen emerging technology and a new form of truly universal public currency. The public ledger is unchangeable, immutable and accessible to everyone. 
 There are infinite reasons one might come up with as to *why* bitcoin might be preferable over fiat money for various applications but it can and should always strive to co-exist with a stable form of slowly inflating fiat currency. Stable money is extremely important to all commerce and trade.  
 Cryptocurrency like bitcoin depending on how popular and common it becomes among normal, average people seems like an incredible way to save and invest for those unfortunate enough to lack the ability to open a bank account in the first place whether due to financial restrictions, geographic location or other burdens. It might be easy for *you* to send  and receive money but not so much for someone living in a village in West Africa or a tribal region in Pakistan.. Do you see where I am going here? 
 Anyone can have reasons to own and use cryptocurrency, it's a personal matter and largely depends in your preferences in a variety of capacities within your day to day life as well as the intermediate and long term. If you can't find a reason to own or use cryptocurrency, then don't...

WOW man , I thought it was bad when I traded 12 of them for 10 oxycontin hahaha
 they were only worth $17 though and it was my first ever BTC purchase.
I guess if it's worth anything though it ran up to $60 within months of that first purchase and I bought a bunch when the first true blockchain fork happened in march of last year. Inadvertantly and unknowingly bought right at the bottom of the drop when the fork spooked everyone. It hit $80+ again that day if I'm not mistaken..

For the application itself it's actually considered an intermediate round. You wouldn't want to use something like a .300 Winchester magnum or a .375 H&amp;H for an 'assault-style' weapon. The disadvantages at close quarters are all but too obvious..
 The cartridge itself and the projectile have been in use since the 60's , there are some much newer rounds like the 6.5 mm Grendel, the .50 caliber Beowulf or the 6.8 mm Remington SPC to name a few but they are all being shelved because it's much easier to keep using a working standard than try to field something new. There have been US military trials to replace the .556 mm for decades...

@_date: 2014-12-21 17:01:01
Mis quote you? I lifted that text directly from your reply. "Secondly, the reason they moved over is purely economical and convenience."
 
Actually the round was specifically chosen to replace the 7.62x51 mm NATO because the 7.62 could not put down a sufficient rate of fire. The British had developed the 7 mm .280 inch intermediate round to replace the .30-06 Springfield. Unfortunately the US govt overruled NATO partners and the 7.62x51 mm was chosen as the standard round. This is NOT the same as the 7.62x39 mm round fired by a Russian Kalashnikov in said caliber. A 7.62x39 mm round only weighs 1.5 times as much as a 5.56x45 mm. When fired from a 20 inch barrel as designed , a 5.56x45 mm NATO round produces the muzzle energy and velocity to penetrate common type 3A class body armor. You will also note that class 3 ( not 3A ) body armor will stop a 7.62x51 mm round so you have no argument there either. 
As I said , go back to your call of duty.

I beleive what you are referring to is typically considered a 'race attack', or a variation of such an attack. In which the person who has control of the fork sends 2 conflicting transactions in such rapid succession that they both go through but one is false...
In terms of a 51% , you would actually be able to REVERSE transactions on the fork. So in essence you could send bitcoin and then rollback the chain and send the same coin to someone else. In that case, both transactions were legit but the one that was rolled back loses the consensus and therefore no longer has the coin(s).

Nay, that doesn't accurately convey the meaning of what I said,. I chose the correct word. They are not explicitly admitting to the notion that undesirables are being killed in this policy 'experiment' but the ideology exist as such on the face of it. As such they are basically saying go out and kill drug dealers and users if you can, but they are allowing the policy to stretch much further than drug crimes and usage. As in pretty much anyone they or their supporters don't really like as long as they can somehow 'prove' they were committing a crime. Then all they have to do is use the drug policy as a cover and you have paramilitary hit squads and vigilante groups going around committing genocide on a civil service level...

I plan on buying a safe large enough to be non theft-able and putting detailed instructions on accessing my bitcoin inside. The code numbers for the safe will be given to an estate lawyer who will then give it to the executor of my will if I pass away. 
 I know the lawyer could make an attempt to steal from the safe somehow but A) they are a lawyer so highly unlikely and B) if the safe is opened with the pass code and the contents stolen there can only be two culprits. Me or the lawyer. It makes the most sense to me in the case that my coins become extremely valuable.

If you think exchange operators don't manipulate prices I'm not sure what to tell you. The exchange facilitates trade on their own internal engine and the books are only actually moved when the end user either deposits or cashes out. Do you really think they run balanced books like a brokered exchange? If anything the majority of these exchanges likely operate on fractional reserve basis and expect to be able to balance books on a time scale in relation to their fee collection.. That is to say they are not all liquid and could be 'bank run' so to speak if majority investors begin pulling stake. 
 If you think Bitmain doesn't supply liqudity to a partner exchange in return for readily available fiat without having to actually participate in the trade aspect of the exchange engine then you're naive. The ongoing daily injection of bitcoin means a lot to afforementioned exchange(s) should they need to balance books on the crypto side of operations.

I've been saying so too, can't just up and open a deliverable 1 day futures market without accumulating what you expect to sell. and why wouldn't they? the whole point of the exchange is profit and they won't be satisfied with just fees alone. if they expect to be able to deliver within 24 hours they won't be buying a la carte in hopes of meeting quota by the next day.. they will mass buy prior to open. if they don't, the risk lies entirely on BAKKT unless they plan on crashing price after close so they can buy what (bitcoin) they owe customers for less fiat. if this were the case the amount of risk inherently increases because they need to effectively crash the market on a daily basis. it would never work that way for long and ICE wouldn't consider it whatsoever. so then it has to be stockpiled assets purchased prior to launch and sold accordingly as next-day deliverable futures.

Depends on what you consider a shady exhange. Don't you wonder why Coinbase suddenly has outages every time bitcoin price starts moving quickly up or down? Aren't you concerned about the manipulation accusations aimed at OKcoin and Bittrex (futures)?. If they manipate futures surely they might try to manipulate bitcoin itself given the opportunity.

The use of the consumer price index itself is unusual to say the least but also does not adequately reflect the growth of the money supply nor does it take into account (properly) fluctuations of prices in certain markets like say the food industry which saw fruit prices rise 13% and meat prices rise 4.5% last year.

It's a node but it's not explicitly 'the internet'. It's a raw connection to the blockchain. The internet can 'go down' and this will still work. All you need is a power source (gas generator) and a satellite setup (not extremely expensive).

If he goes to school or gets a job there's still a damn good chance he will end up having to live with his parents in the foreseeable future anyway, being that a lot of millennials are faced with that situation already. I'm not saying being proactive about earning and saving is a bad choice or anything like that but he won't be striking it rich or supporting himself independently (at least any time soon) with either a load of student debt to pay off or no debt but a shitty ass min wage job. At least with a gamble of a risk like bitcoin he has a chance of becoming wealthy without having to work his body into the floor. You do that with a min wage job *AND / OR* schooling to get a good job, as I mentioned, so unless you are born rich there is no way out. You will literally ruin your body no matter which route you take. You can't win the lottery if you don't play. The odds argument doesn't work either because people *DO* win lotteries and risky investments *DO* make people rich, often. It's not an easy win but it's a possibility, unless you don't play or invest. Then you're just guaranteed to sit and rot (or ruin your body trying to make whatever constitutes 'enough' money for you personally).

Everything is controlled by suits. If they wanted to break into your house right now and kill you there isn't really any way to stop them, whoever they are... I mean we can all get rich and hide our secret Swiss bank accounts or bitcoins or whatever but the governments and their business lobby basically draft and enforce laws that you can't break without consequences rising incrementally in severity depending on what you did.
 I don't think it's a great system, far from perfect. But what you have in an uncontrolled environment is either total anarchy, which at it's most basic form is just chaos and at best becomes something even worse than you had prior (dictatorship?). Pick and choose your battles I guess is all I am trying to say. Losing this one might end up costing core and their supporters more than it's worth.

Someone made a post titled 'First 5 people to comment get 1 free bitcoin' back in 2013 and I was the first person to randomly see it and comment. Didn't leave an address and got called out by OP for it but edited the address in and managed to still beat the 5th person who commented. No word of a lie I got that full coin and it was worth about $80 at the time. It was Easter weekend when the price pumped up above $80 for the first time ever.
 Whoever you are I will never forget your generosity. I ended up losing that coin by trying to day trade bitcoin through the mayhem that was 2013. But I learned a lot from it all and I am a proud HODLer now. Invested my own $$$ in mid '14 and never looked back. Thank you again if you ever see this.

World GDP is just a measure of how many dollars were made (earned) in the given year, spread across all sectors and industries. It in no way denominates the actual value of products, services or theoretical upper limits on what can be valued in terms of material cost and monetary worth,. That is to say the value of all the goods and services in the world to date far exceeds the (world) GDP of any given year and is actually impossible to calculate granted the scale of an ever changing system where products and services are produced and sold hundreds of thousands of times a second globally.
 For instance, the notional value of the derivatives market at large as a whole is estimated to be worth roughly $1.2 quadrillion dollars.

Came here to say it now so I can say "I told you so" later and be the first to say it before anyone else does. 
 Since we are all pretty much in agreement that this rise is organic and due to supply / demand or scarcity , whichever you choose, I think things are about to get very real very quickly. All this to the moon jargon is funny and nostalgic but notwithstanding a crash for whatever reason (exchange hack or a random fork or something) I think it really is going to the moon this time. How fast is open for debate but the bitcoin for sale @ Bitfinex is looking very thin ( $3.28m USD for sale until price reaches $1500 but *ONLY* $3.38M USD for sale until price reaches $5000 ) and also bitstamp ( $4m USD until price reaches $7540 )

I had $20k in the bank, was about to buy 1000 coins at $17 a piece after observing them rise from $15 to $17 shortly after first learning about bitcoin. I was excited until some unforeseen circumstances cost me $10k and I was afraid to spend the remaining $10k because "something might happen and I might need the money". Well, later that year I was kicking myself for not going in and spending the whole $20k. I could have accumulated some debt to pay for my unforeseen circumstances and would have been a millionaire but hindsight is 20/20. I was blinded by fear and uncertainty back then. 
 I have since reinvested but at 30x the price. I still have a chance to be a millionaire but bitcoin will need to be valued around $200k, which is possible but unlikely. And even if they do get there I will be thinking about how I came so close to having $200m if I had only bought those 1000 coins...

Any profit reinvested at that point ($160) on top of the initial investment is compounding. Since profit is inherently impossible without aforementioned 'price action before their purchase', anyone whom purchased more bitcoin or invested any portion or all of said profit in bitcoin at that point ($160) is inherently still profiting from the initial short.

Someone is definitely squeezing the market, you can tell cause the price drops on a near daily basis every day before the Chinese banks open for business allowing the backlog of wire transfers from the previous session to clear. It's an obvious bear trap every time. Someone is trying to scare the bots and weak hands into selling more bitcoin below whatever the current sell wall levels are. As soon as the transfers clear and money enters the exchange(s) you see the bear trap close and the price runs back up to where it was hours before..

What happens if the foreign currencies lose value? Your USD peg supply is no longer solvent in that case and distribution means it's basically impossible to recall the money. In that case you must buy more foreign currency or risk the system failing on a fundamental level. You are relying solely on the stability of a mixed basket of fiat which will always change in value as backing. In the event of operating at a net loss where does the average holder of this peg go to recover said value?

So you are trying to say the market corrects and support changes indefinitely in correlation to events the same way every market system known to mankind has since the dawn of finance? Well gee, thanks for the lesson!
 Bitstamp's market orders are thin compared to Bitfinex but a cursory glance will reveal 85% of the active buy offers (11m USD) sit at the $600 mark. This is telling; also taking into account that Bitfinex was hacked recently which resulted in a magnitude of those who still had bitcoin on the exchange fleeing and many simply transferred their assets should they wish to participate in market speculation, to Bitstamp. Although Bitfinex has recovered it's position of most liquid current exchange in terms of purchase orders, the actual sellers seemingly have yet to return to the exchange full force. Thus many have chosen to leave the bitcoin they wish to sell on-exchange at Bitstamp. Which in turn means the sell orders are padded in earnest. While this has an equally cloudy effect on the number of sell orders on Bitfinex I would surmise that most of the actual on exchange purchasing throughout this bull run is still executed via Bitfinex, more so considering the source of the cumulative buying seems to be happening in China. (Bitfinex being a Chinese exchange).
While you are absolutely correct that the market itself can't be completely interpreted through the orders sitting on-exchange the consensus is that this rise is a direct impact of actual scarcity of bitcoin on the market for sale and thereto that the demand for said bitcoin is increasing rapidly unable to cope with what dwindling supply is currently offered.
Or to be simple; you really can read more into the market by simply gauging the position of orders on either side than you can via most (any) other paradigm.

No, but if the individual buys a lottery ticket with the money from the bet they won and that lottery ticket wins them one million dollars which had they otherwise not spent said money from the bet, and whence they would not have bought that lottery ticket to begin with had they not the proceeds of prior gambling, within which that creates a condition that the money from the first bet was compounded into a subsequent bet. So forth by causality the two are intrinsically linked.

The problem is nobody has an inkling of where the price *should* go and the use case potential of the underlying asset itself is absurdly untapped thus far. I know what you are saying but you are describing a trader, not an *investor*. A true (actual) investor is invested in the asset for reasons beyond profit potential. A speculative investment is just that, but somebody who believes in the technology or service they are investing in will not simply set a price target and stick by it.

The nominal value of investment dollars would likely be somewhere between 7%-11% of notional value, that being said they are also dangerous because they use heavily leveraged investments like credit and commodity swaps, the former which had a major role in the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the latter affecting copper prices in exponential fashion during the same period.

There's a difference between an investor and a trader. Investors don't sell, and if they beleive in the asset they continue to hold and purchase as bloody as the streets become. There are investors like Warren Buffet who hold like a true motherfucker. He just doesn't fw bitcoin because he doesn't really understand it and he knows that. The man literally says he will not invest in something he does not understand. He also still has a flip phone, drives an aging beater Cadillac and still owns and lives in his first home, a modest average living at best.  
 Investors only sell when they want to cash out or bail. But anyone who bails as an investor similarly has no confidence in the underlying asset. We are experiencing a massive exodus of weak hands and short term 'investors' / traders.

these supposedly anon crypto ATMs usually have at least a camera in them for QR codes and stuff, wouldn't be surprised if they were snapping shots of the users face too.. they are operating under loopholes in a lot of places in a sort of lack of regulation where KYC doesn't exist for crypto ATMs specifically yet.

okay but the lack of regulation IS a loophole. in Texas the gun laws surrounding private sale don't state you can anonymously buy firearms and certain explosives from other private citizens without background checks or any sort of KYC at all but because there is a lack of wording surrounding such circumstances and at a state level there have never been regulations introduced, it happens and is acceptably legal. Lawmakers are well aware of this and the population at large has dubbed it the 'gunshow loophole'. you can look it up if you want, but the state itself and the feds are doing everything they can to introduce lobby to change the law, they just keep getting vetoed and stifled by gun owners and groups like the NRA.
as it stands, terrorists could buy assault weapons and even anti-materiel rifles (.50 BMG and 20mm) without anyone knowing and the person who sold the hardware to them is basically absolved if he says he was unaware they were terrorists..
a lack of regulation is considered a loophole if other regulations already exist to similar ends within the industry. crypto ATMs currently do operate in a legal grey area and there are ways criminals could easily abuse the system(s) to launder money or finance illegal activity.
to be fair though, dirty money has infiltrated every aspect of investing in modern society, there are allegations that a large part of the property boom in British Columbia is being financed by foreign crime syndicates.

do your research first, these things are low volume most of the time and the new FATF rules will see G20 nations on a fast track to registering and regulating crypto ATMs. unless you find a high traffic spot like a populated area in a mall, the income of the machine will be relatively poor. factor in the cost of renting space and conversion fees for swapping your own crypto to fiat and vice versa (these machines have a book system built in, it works similar to bitpay where it will take your cash and send you crypto or give a generated private key but the machine then buys back crypto from a market source, and the $$ difference between what you payed and what it pays for the same amount of crypto is basically the crypto ATM's business model).
 there is a reason a lot of them are constantly out of service or they disappear after a short while when the owner realizes the space their ATM occupies isn't high traffic enough to support reasonable profit.
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:45:02
The problem is the increase in actual supply isn't the biggest caveat to what creates or diminishes value..

I was arguing the liquidity of many exchanges being on a fractional basis over a year ago, the book keeping algo has to be on top of EVERYTHING at all times or disparity will rise and the exchange will eventually become insolvent. Of course it could go the other way around and the exchange collects and holds enough fees in reserve to cover all deposits, which is the business model of an exchange to begin with.. at least a successful exchange. 
 Keeping end-books balanced properly is the most important part of the crypto exchange business. I assume it's extremely difficult without a constantly changing and adapting algo *along with* prompt human intervention support if things go awry.

plenty of no-fee credit card options around. as long as you pay your monthly minimum or keep it 0 balance you won't incur a fee. 
 
 Fee laden gimmick cards are a bane on the rest of us though because you're right about that. the fees oft don't cover a prolific user's rewards and the people who get charged fees are either delinquent in paying off the balance or they outright chose a card with a built in fee (usually annual but sometimes monthly depending on the card, carrier and limits or lack thereof.)  
 Of course anyone who pays the 19%+ murder rate for not repaying in timely fashion is techhnicaly subsidizing the clients who remain in good standing... for the cc carrier and handler it's as much a value proposition as it is to the individual carrying the (account).

Good luck friendo, those markets are cornered like a motherfucker and your crypto bet could go either way. I'd much rather not try to sell any bootleg shoes , tennis rackets or happy endings thanks. Collecting fees off bitcoin trading hands one way or another even if it's just hodl and wait makes more sense than sinking money into a guaranteed losing battle.

Huge amount of value, probably hoops to jump through and log(s) to produce on behalf of different individuals at LBC in terms of procedural requirements that they have no control over. Either / or regulatory obligations, maybe there are things they have to run past a supervisor or whatever. They have a limited number of employees and a huge number of support requests to handle.. The backlog is real. 
 If anything you will receive your refund in a not so timely manner because that's just the cost of making such a mistake when you rely on a third party to handle transactions. You can take comfort in obviously knowing that if you had not been using a service you would likely have lost the bitcoin permanently.
 Sit tight and let them do their job.

In 2013 prior to the run to 1k a litecoin / bitcoin trader at btc-e struck it big and cashed out to buy a big house in Florida and a Murcielago. He posted a link to a pic in the trollbox proving his fortune with a newspaper from that day and a hand written note with his username and a short message. We ate it up and all thought he was a crypto god. It was around the rize chickun / Fontas era.

He could easily have taken the fiat and just bought bitcoin with it instead. This just seems like a lot of hoops to jump through, although taking fiat for the sale of the house and buying bitcoin might take longer because funds take time to clear and then there is the hassle of registering and verifying with an exchange capable of selling 35 bitcoin in one transaction. 
I guess it *does* sort of make sense but it can go both ways. The price of bitcoin can crash and leave him reeling in his decision whereas if he had taken fiat he would still be whole.

uhh, no. the prototype machines being produced today are for experimental research programs in quantum computation. at this point if we compare the development of quantum computer chips to say automobiles, we would be at the point where Karl Benz was fiddling around with carriages and trying to find someone with the skill and technology to produce a purpose built prototype engine to mount on (carriages). quantum computers still haven't been developed outside conceptual research and theory based design builds.  
  
 yes, the basis for larger quantum computers does exist today but the single atom transistor and qubit multi point computation chip of the future are nothing but concepts in development. even the most advanced examples are extremely limited in scope. nothing close to being able to crack SH256...

The senate comfirms everything, it's beurocracy. To expect the board not be aligned with elite and government at the behest of their whim is to expect any sort of actual transparency in such a closed system truly exists. Even private sector decisions should be *expected* to have come from lobby and manipulation if not outright state level corruption. All this built upon a system that was supposed to protect the public and economy.. But to what end? Printing endless amounts of physical 'money' or otherwise (digital) fiat to succeed. It's all about control or the need to.

Paying for lunch is obviously not something you need to be invisible about.. There are a lot of reasons forth which bitcoin is and always has been used for that do require at least nominal (basic) fungibility in transactions. I know we have Monero but sometimes the use case for bitcoin over altcoin supercedes the actual anon requirement E.G. the service you are paying does not accept Monero. In places like Venezuela it actually is rather important *right now*. The whole payment system for first world leisure idea is secondary to the general importance of a globally functional public sovereign money supply.

Bruh, you played with fire. I've done the whole exchanges / alts routine. BTCe and mcxNOW were my jam. I played and lost but I never risked more than a fraction of my capital and never got locked in by anyone outside my own mistakes walling me into holding bags. I even transferred a ridiculous sum of BTC to hitBTC last year, played with the bcash market then left, they sent it all back to me when I requested without complication. Took less than 20 min to go from their withdrawal confirm page to actually broadcasting the tx. In essence I have never had a problem because I never submitted my will to a corp asking for verification or proof of anything. And guess what? Those 3 exchanges I mentioned are regarded as some of the scammiest, scummiest and most criminally-linked of all. I never even had problems with cryptsy..

There was massive resistance already, but someone ran a huge beartrap and scared all the traders into selling short. Now they're building floors and moving up the ladder.

It was a power struggle between the Austro Hungarian empire, the Russian empire and the Ottoman empire... So yeah, kinda was about trade in many ways. Also, Germany knew the Russians were growing their army on a massive scale during the Russian civil war and wanted Austria to go to war before the Russian army grew too powerful. It was really Germany who pressured the Austro Hungarian empire into using the murder of Franz Ferdinand as an excuse to declare war.

Let's say the price is $400. The chaos surrounding the gox collapse caused the price to drop so quickly and sporadically that we saw $400 become $200 but since the bots and trade engine were not prepared or aware of the situation ( since not super AI ) the price spiked back up to $400. Some quick acting individuals placed buys and sells near the ceiling and floor and doubled their money on a magnitude of several orders. In that 5 mins it was possible to make 100% profit more than once. In fact the swings were so rapid it were as if someone was blinking and the price moved 80% - 100%+ with every blink.

There was a lot of civil conflict in Germany and Austria prior to the German decision to finally pressure Austria and Hungary to go to war. A huge part of the final stages of planning for the Germans was how bad internal politics was becoming. They knew going to war with Russia would either end the civil unrest or allow it to fester enough that the citizenry would no longer have a capacity to fight their own government or demonstrate and organize against it. Hitler used the same strategy to propel nazism into popularity. War back then meant food shortages and the manpower of the people dissolved. It was as much a way to take the minds of the population off the poor social conditions they experienced as it was a genuine act of aggression.

Until a bank or credit handler like VISA decide to start offering bitcoin related accounts and products to customers I think it's sort of pointless to try to use it for small purchases. Even large stuff over the internet is much easier to buy with fiat money or a credit card, obviously.

UASF meaning user activated soft fork. Bitcoin is having scaling issues (too many users and network is full) and there are several solutions on the table but the community and more specifically the miners cannot agree on which scaling solution to implement. This has created a deadlock in which miners have up until very recently (within the last week) blocked any attempt at scaling that is not their own. 
 Fortunately with UASF the nodes and those in control of the most important nodes can decide to work around the miners and implement segregated witness as the preferred scaling method. The majority of the community agrees segregated witness is the best solution for many reasons, including creating the ability for bitcoin to operate on second layer solutions like lightning network.

 This rollercoaster shit might go on for a while yet. Scaling solution needs to be put in place and market has to actually scale up successfully first. Payment channels and other second layer solutions that enable everyday consumers to easily interact with bitcoin also haven't materialized fully.

Trending back up right now though. Granted, it was up at $2640 a couple days ago and went back down to $2k but it's up at $2,278 as I write this and running fast.
 Usually it gets dumped a bit on Friday afternoon and doesn't recover until around Sunday afternoon or even early Monday morning. 
 I know it doesn't happen every weekend but that seems to be the trend. Dump on Friday buy on Sunday.

You're acting as if credit swaps are calculated but this equation does not even consider swaps as leveraged investments. If a position is closed in a swap it does not count toward the notional closing price of the asset and does not create false value. Nor does it impact the total value of all shares within the fund both held by the fund for sale if shares remain, nor the shares held by investors.
 Most of the 1.2 tn valuation comes from leveraged equity like the mortgage market, indexed funds or interest rate contracts... And swaps account for an extremely small percentage of the overall derivatives market to begin with. The banks have not been so heavy into them for over a decade. They only started being used in considerable numbers again about two years ago.

If you think someone cannot buy coinbase you can't be more wrong. In fact there was false speculation around here not *yesterday* that claimed bitpay had been bought by Jihan Wu. I understand how full nodes and so-called 'economic nodes' operate and I understand the blockchain well. You also don't seem to grasp that the largest exchange with the most volume only has a paltry $20m sitting on the buy side which means exchanges in general do not create a fraction of overall volume. Exchanges are for traders, most of the activity comes from OTC purchases and things like coin atm. Mining only produces 1800 coins daily and most of them are not immediately sold. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:13:06
Thing is most people still don't use cryptocurrency or know anything about it really, other than 'bitcoin'. 
 It's going to take a long time to get people using cryptocurrency in general. Those predisposed to participate already have and the influx entering the market right now is not even a minority fraction of those whom bitcoin and cryptocurrency could potentially serve.

In the grand scheme I think a satoshi should eventually be worth more than one cent because you can't buy anything with one cent and even though a single satoshi is unusable dust it's still one hundred millionth of a bitcoin, a penny is just a damn penny. I already feel like I should value a satoshi more than a penny.
 I don't see how this can't go to one million US dollars per bitcoin or ten times that based on the fact that people love anything to do with the internet, their phones and money. You combine all three with the mass hysteria that is the possibility of becoming wealthy and you really do have some tulip mania level potential. If a tulip can be worth twenty five times the salary of a skilled tradesman then an immutable, sovereign and decentral; publicly secured system of value and exchange can definitely be worth as much or more than a tulip during tulip mania.

What you're seeing is supply finally catching up to demand which had begun to peak, causing the run up from around $1k. The backlog of tx still waiting to confirm are also a reason the price is starting to tank (confidence waning due to stagnancy in creating a scaling solution and the growing number of unconfirmed tx) but mostly it's because the rapid rise in new users in both OTC and exchange volume is tapering off. And I am guessing some (a lot) of the weak hands are in a panic dumping because they think it will crash below their point of entry and don't want to lose money (newbs and short term hodlers + day traders) and possibly those trying to short the market (investors, traders and possibly miners who are only receiving tx fees and not obtaining blocks like the large pools and mega ASIC factories.).
 While I doubt this drop is going to significantly slow the rise in price going forward, I similarly doubt the rise will be parabolic. In that I don't think you will see a 100%+ rise from this point in the near future (3-6 months). The rise from $1k to $1800 is an 80% gain. This might be a bubble but it's not a massive one like the rise from $80-$1200 that Mt Gox and it's (their) manipulation caused under the oversight of Karpeles.. That was a nightmare scenario.
 If bitcoin can recover from that situation (Gox) it can likely recover from anything short of it's encryption being compromised by quantum computers or some sort of insanely powerful conventional array, or a random fork (not HF) like the one in early '13.

Thing is at current prices I would never be able to even come close to matching what I already have in $ value worth of bitcoin.

Notional value equates to the total value of a leveraged asset... It's easy to look this stuff up. 
 Leverage is still real money, and if you make horrendous losses and end up owing 10x or 100x what you had invested you still owe the brokerage that money.
 The notional value of all derivatives in existence can easily far outstrip the global M3 (around 60 trillion) because money is not the only thing that holds value on this planet. Equity like homes and the value locked in them is estimated in the hundreds of trillions. When you write a contract based on the value locked in millions of homes (leveraged instruments issued by banks to derivative markets) you are essentially allowing investors to buy pieces of the equity in the mortgage market that the bank is deferring to those derivative investors. They are passing on proportional risk.
 If I had 5 million to invest in an equity derived fund and used 10x leverage I am effectively borrowing 50 million from the fund. I have assumed the responsibility of 50m worth of shares and if the fund tanks due to market conditions and I have no stop loss I owe 50m..
 You add all the value of leveraged investments in derivatives together and have notional value. It can and does far outstrip available fiat money globally. This should only be confusing to people who don't understand how a derivative or leverage works. Contracts are based on real assets in derivatives, not on hand cash or the value of a single unit of the underlying equity.

A sovereign unit of exchange on a public ledger backed by immutable trust is worth a lot more than just belief though.. There are real world use cases and the majority of them have not been realized thus far. The entire concept of a blockchain is still in it's teething phase but rest assured being able to sieve power from banks and put trust in the hands of the public outside government and corporations is invaluable. Whether inherent, perceived or intrinsic, bitcoin itself being the premier and most trusted and openly used cryptocurrency puts it in a prime spot to capture significant shares of multiple open and closed market systems currently operated by banks and private corporations.
 The utility is there, it's to be seen whether it's used properly or disregarded as you seem to have concluded.

If you can transfer a million US dollars anywhere in the world circumventing banks and credit providers for a couple bucks or less you're still getting a damn good deal.
 If you want to buy a chocolate bar you should probably use cash or credit. I mean aside from the obvious tx fee, most OTC or off exchange customers end up paying a premium on btc to begin with. Unless you are getting a significant discount to use it for purchases I don't know why anyone would actually want to use bitcoin to buy something small instead of cash, other than novelty or loyalty to (bitcoin).
 But if you're complaining about having to spend a couple bucks to use it I think you're missing the point. And if you pay the correct fee your tx does go through, greedy miners be damned.

I dunno I haven't really been into alts for a couple years, I'd look at the bitcointalk boards and see what people in the trollbox at BTC-e are saying if I were you though. Study it a little and don't make any investments with your original bitcoin stash. Use a separate fund for playing with alts and start that one fresh.
 Trust me it's not easy to game alts. Most of them are massively pre mined and coins are already in the hands of the people who seeded the fund for the alt; you don't want to be an investor in those. If you do participate in the pump and dumps make sure you get in and get out fast. When they dump they usually end up crashing permanently.

That's assuming bitcoin is even to be measured as a currency though. I mean if it works like a commodity and currency at the same time it's more of a hybrid asset class and even the global M3 does not include the equity in things like total global property value.
 As an example let's say we view bitcoin as a type of non physical property. For simplification let's include a comparison to actual physical properties like homes and farms. Each home and farm sits in a unique locale and obviously varies in price due to things like size and suitability to the buyer (if it is a farm are the conditions suitable to grow the crop you are considering? etc..). Each property is unique and the total number of properties globally is in the hundreds of millions or potentially billions. Therefore a property in Chicago worth x in building materials but in a dilapidated state and located in a heavy crime area can be valued as low as $1.
 Compare this to bitcoin which is limited to 21 million units. All units are identical. While obviously a non physical property the potential use cases are massive. The market cap value can likely exceed the global M3 if bitcoin truly becomes an independent market linked form of equity in which derivatives contracts can be written and ETFs traded based on bitcoin. It's a single asset that could potentially perform the duties of entire asset classes and it's extremely limited.
 Imagine if there were only 21 million properties (homes / farms / buildings etc..) or 21 million barrels of oil in existence. A single home or barrel of oil would be worth a ridiculous sum.

Of course they do but with your original example based on the chart we are talking about two different standpoints, wherein you were alluding to breaking even which is why I postulated how does it apply to the person with 10,000% paper profit already accumulated. It's two different types of risk; actual loss and perceived loss. Though you can consider perceived loss technically, actual loss can only be achieved by falling below break even. There is always technical risk of a pullback at any price but your talking points in the original statement / the context of the post do not apply (in terms of actual loss) to the person wih 10,000% profit.

In a budding infrastructure of a literally brand new currency (compared to legacy money) the economic majority outside of individuals holding smaller amounts (&lt;10btc) is constantly shifting and changing. It's like the wild west gold rush frontier. It's developing along and evolving at a decent rate but for now any shmoe with a couple hundred million dollars can legitimately move market prices around. They might lose a small fortune trying to short or lock a lot of money up going long but as it is right now, they can literally move the price up or down based on their power. Not to the extremes of contrast (they can't crash it to $0 or make it rise to $10k) but they can still move the ticker in a concerted effort.
 It's literally impossible to have 'the economic majority' on your side here and even if you do gain a proportional amount of said majority backing your proposal, that majority could shift overnight. In that someone else with more money or more coins (or likely both) will show up and move your majority back to a minority in short order.
 Right now I believe the economic majority is Bitmain and Antpool / Jihan Wu unfortunately. He has control of a lot of coins and obviously a lot of USD by extension. He has majority hash and has the hearts and minds of a lot of very powerful individuals in the space on his side. I'm not saying there is not overwhelming support for segwit and a reasonable scaling solution outside BU... But, the odds and numbers are stacked in his (Wu) favor obviously.

The leverage in equity and indexed derivatives is very much there though. Just because the investor is only injecting the marginal requirement to enter the contract doesn't mean the shares are not linked to real assets whether it's liquid cash put up by the issuer from other allocations or actual physical stuff like barrels of oil in a warehouse or property owned by banks underlying mortgage equity derivatives. You invest a marginal requirement (say 5%) and they loan you the other 95% of the shares. At least when you are talking things like equity backed or index fund derivatives. They don't need to own actual shares of the index to issue a contract based on futures though, I mean what you are basically saying is that the futures market is null because it's not the future yet...

I've been watching this trend on Bitcoinity for almost three weeks though it's the same every day, they line up sell resistance on the bid walls of both Bitstamp and Bitfinex then when pressure is high enough and buys start to slow down they smash into the bids simultaneously at exactly the same points. It usually cascades downward and the chart shows a waterfall effect while the weaker hands get shaken out and stop losses are triggered.
 The reasoning is always the same, just as you want more bitcoin so do they. They just have way more bitcoin than most of us and they can shake the tree while all this new money is flying in. It's a dangerous game but for a whale with 10k+ bitcoin it's not a huge deal to risk 1k-2k coins trying to gain more. If they fail to drop prices they just keep the fiat $$$, win win.

No shit Sherlock. That's the point of the scaling debate... It's an issue being compounded by people who don't really understand enough about bitcoin or how the miners secure the network via fees and hunting block rewards. The public mouthbox shitting allover bitcoin are the ones causing the problem. It's just not ready for people to be using it willy nilly on shit they can buy with a credit card or cash 10x easier. The eventuality is a solution will have to be put in place obviously, but until then these people are nothing but vocal idiots spamming the network and shitting allover it because they don't understand why their tx is stuck or dropped.
 They should all come back when bloat is not an issue, a scaling solution has been put in place and micro tx are prevalent with secondary layers and / or side chains handling their immediate needs.

Not at all. I read the whitepaper in January 2013 when I invested in bitcoin.
 The sole purpose of bitcoin is the blockchain. Immutable public trust. The fact that the unit of account (bitcoin) on the Bitcoin blockchain acts like money in some ways doesn't have anything to do with the purpose of inventing the technology. You are so misinformed. You're also spreading misinformation. 
 The fact that the network is still seeing record volume across exchanges and most notably OTC markets points to the fact that higher fees have not impacted user activity whatsoever. It really doesn't matter if people use it as a currency or not because that isn't the end goal. 
 If you can't see the value in a sovereign unit of exchange on a decentralized open public ledger system you must be blind or dumb.

In fact this relief rally is solid *proof* that the scaling debate caused the price stumble, because it only resumed once BIP91 activation signalling crossed the threshold.
 The next 10-12 hours will decide whether the rally continues toward ATH starting today, or we have to wait until the next signalling period.

Nothing. They aren't being given the bitcoin to buy something with it today. It's a small tip, yes, but also a piece of experimental public technology and history itself. I'd tell them explicitly not to spend it yet unless they absolutely had to and that they wouldn't really even be able to spend it yet, but one day it might be worth a lot more and they should consider holding on to it. Potentially just to be able to say they have bitcoin? I dunno.

Yes, that's how the value of leveraged instruments is supposed to be calculated. Since there is no way to actually calculate all the derivatives being held and offered globally right now the 1.2 quadrillion figure is a high estimate based on actual calculations.
 It's not like leverage doesn't exist or isn't 'real' money. If you shit the bed and lose 50x of what your marginal requirement investment was (no stop loss) then you owe the brokerage that money. 
 Do you think it's all imaginary or something? Market value and actual assets held by the investor are not and should not mirror the total notional value of the contract, that's the fucking point of leveraged investments...

The price is *depressed* right now because of the scaling debate and uncertainty regarding it. Whether segwit is the reason bitcoin will rise to new ATH or not is an aside to the fact that the price would have been $3500-$4000 by now if the scaling debate had not stopped the rally. This is just a resumption of the bull run. It will play out all over again when the 2x 'fork' occurs if and when that happens. Albeit, the ATH will be higher. 
 If there is a real hard fork though and two separate chains competing I think the lows could get lower than we've seen in the last week or so.

You're right but the one thing bitcoin has going for it is market dominance and the capital already invested in it by so many startups and investors. It's the trusted immutable chain. For any one of these cryptos to truly succeed they need backers and most importantly market confidence.
 Whether or not scaling comes now or later I believe it will come. And I don't think the amount of money and individuals who put time and effort into building an ecosystem for bitcoin are just going to jump ship. That would, in my opinion cripple the trust factor if not in a technical sense then a sort of metaphysical sense. That is that if you can't trust one chain to be the top chain it dilutes the entire system by effectively making it a multi market gamble in which there can never be a permanent reserve. Loss of confidence in bitcoin is a terrifying prospect for all blockchains.
@_date: 2017-05-17 07:19:36
Considering bitcoin is legal currency in Japan now I think there is a lot of OTC movement, you can see real trade volumes for localbitcoins @ coindance. Assuming the majority of mining and selling of mined coins happens in China and since Bitfinex (largest bitcoin exchange globally) is a Chinese exchange I have to assume a lot of coins are bought and sold by Chinese nationals. But I cannot be certain.
 As for starting an exchange in your house in the US I think you might run afoul of local municipal level and also federal laws prohibiting you from being a 'money transmitting service' as defined by your state. Some states are more bitcoin friendly than others but I think if you try to run an exchange without registering it somehow and paying taxes you are asking for a visit from the IRS and or a lot of police officers. Not a good idea in my opinion.

The simplest but least desirable solution for everyone is time. Moore's law will progress and having larger blocks will become less of an issue. Right now the problem is bloat. People (especially miners) do not want the bitcoin blockchain to be massive. While 1mb every 10 mins / 144mb every day is not a huge problem right now, increasing block size to 32mb at current would mean a years worth of (now) blockchain in roughly 12 days. We can't have such limits until the HDD has evolved or SSD components are shrunk small enough to contain such massive amounts of memory.
 1gb/s internet becoming standard will also alleviate the need for a limit on block size. As it is right now though, bigger blocks mean bloat and that's a huge problem. One of the main reasons we can't just hf or change the limit.

The govt was complacent because it was boosting the already booming economy so they allowed and even encouraged it.
 Now they have ghost cities full of skyscrapers and shopping malls and condominiums / apartments that nobody uses. Literally empty but should have 500k - over 1m people living in these cities. 
 When the carpet comes out from under the Chinese economy (it's already happening and has been for several years) RMB will crash and as OP has stated, a lot of property will become next to worthless.
 That is not to say a home in a great area in Beijing will lose value. You are correct when you say space is limited and buyers are plentiful. But the value of homes in major cities cannot prop up an inflated and dubiously conceived economy. It's like a gold standard, the homes are worth a lot and always will be but you can't use that to finance ghost cities without repercussions.

You can say whatever you want, that's what makes the internet great. Unfortunately it also allows you to spew your incorrect opinion allover the place wherever you please. Miners may or may not fall under the umbrella term of economic majority but the merchants who accept and transact in bitcoin certainly make up the backbone of the network in terms of actual, real world volume.
 So you couldn't be more wrong.

I've already conceded that $1m isn't enough to retire on. I've settled around $7m as the comfort zone.

Anything is possible. Is it likely? I don't doubt it, but I am not going to tell you to buy $10,000 worth unless you are comfortable potentially losing it all.
 The likelihood of you losing it all is much smaller than the likelihood of bitcoin being worth $20,000 USD by 2020.

Apparently there are capital gains taxes enforced on it in the US anyway even if you just spend bitcoin without converting back to fiat.

Do you think there will be implications for innocent unknowing victims who may have used BTC-e several years ago?
 What I am worried about is that say bitcoin soars to $100k or $1m and someone who used BTC-e in the past without knowing of their illegal activity might somehow be implicated when they attempt to pay taxes on capital gains (from the sale of bitcoin profit) in the future. Let's say a government body decides to scrutinize the transactions between the bitcoin users wallet and finds that it had indeed interacted with wallets belonging to BTC-e in the past, even if the user had not been aware that BTC-e was conducting illegal activity?

Everyone has been pulling numbers from their ass for weeks. Nobody knows what's going on or how far this will go or whether it will crash like hell.

Merriam Webster doesn't have a definition for 'economic majority', that was a quip at your intelligence.. But that's an aside to the fact that no matter what you or anyone commenting in this stupid thread thinks, says or does about it, economic majority as defined within the bitcoin network refers to the individuals and businesses doing the most transacting volume over the network for any given period. This isn't something you can successfully argue against.
 Call it what you will.
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:53:06
Even within that definition you will *never* see someone use the word couple for anything more than three. In the context OP used it's clear he absolutely meant to say two but even if he said "few" you can't possibly think that means five. I've been speaking English as a first language in an English speaking country my entire life, and I have never once heard anyone say a couple in reference to more than two. A couple means two people, not some weird love triangle. A couple means two bucks in retail. A couple or coupling means a link in which two objects can be joined. In mechanics a couple is *two* equal or parallel forces acting in opposite direction to produce rotation.. A couple in carpentry refers to a pair of rafters connected by a tie beam or a collar beam. None of these definitions refer to more than two. You can get away with using it when you mean to reference 'a few' if you mean two or three sometimes but five is outside that definition. 
 You can believe what you want. As historical price data shows, it did not double "in the last couple months". If you can show me one chart which shows a 100% rise on a single exchange and not a combined index of several exchanges then you are correct. But as it stands, bitcoin has not doubled in price in the last couple months by any standard. It has risen 80%, maybe 85% @ Bitfinex.

I'm not so sure. I mean I know for a fact a scaling solution must be implemented to move forward and grow the network, but for larger consumers and corporations / corporate retailers and independent smaller businesses depending on application I still think there is plenty of new market participation going on. Even with $1+ fees volumes in OTC markets are exploding at an exponential rate. People are using it, for how long is the question. I don't see the current 'high' fee impacting it as much just yet though.
 If it costs too much to use for microtransactions it will remain a speculative store of value and an experimental technology. 
 Eventually the size of the blockchain shouldn't really matter as Moore's law should see memory continually grow in size and internet speeds increase categorically. Being able to download the whole blockchain even for average user wallets / QT shouldn't be a problem when we have 100+tb storage and 1gb/s internet. But for right now and the immediate future I think it's either stalemate, UASF, a hf to raise the blocksize limit or some sort of miracle in which he (Wu) signals segwit.

 I know, it has value because you can live in it and it's in a prime location. But there is a market for the ultra rich in which $100m homes exist.
 If bitcoin becomes so scarce and distributed so widely that it's almost impossible to find someone who has and is willing to sell a whole bitcoin , it could reach unimaginable heights. It could get to the point where parties like banks or govts are seeking to pay a *premium* on those insane prices just to find someone who is willing to fork one over. As in, $187m market price but the PBOC or US fed is offering $220m to anyone who can sell them a full bitcoin within the next 3 days or w.e
 Just a speculative theory.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:05:57
You don't understand though man this is probably either a whale trying to accumulate more bitcoin or a large entrant to the market attempting to drive prices down for obvious reason. The crashes happen at random intervals every 24 hours and happen across major exchanges. 
 It's either someone trying to purposefully drive down prices or it's a miner selling off their proceeds (Jihan and co. likely). Miners are the only ones who can dump this many coins consistently who would not want the price to go down.

What happens if I want to give someone $2 and I don't give a shit about spending an extra $2 to do it?
 I mean it's not a huge deal yet. Micro tx are not a good idea right now obviously but giving someone $5 over the internet with a sovereign decentralized system of exchange backed by public trust is still worth the $2 or so cost to send the transaction.
 If it were $10 or $20 fees I would obviously feel much differently. But even then, if I need to send a large amount of money outside traditional channels very quickly, $10 or $20 still isn't a huge cost.
 I understand that the fee puts a lot of people on the sidelines but scaling will hopefully solve that. For now though I don't mind the fees even if I am sending sub $5 tx because it's not like I am sending $5 tx all day long.  
 For merchants or services who's business is to handle tipping in bitcoin though you couldn't be more right. It's a barrier to micro tx and tipping on a larger scale.

Since nobody has given a real answer yet, the bitcoin reward given to miners for unlocking (winning) a block of bitcoin is cut in half roughly every four years.

In the case of miners and nodes 2mb or 4mb makes sense for today, but the average Joe can't always go out and buy a new SSD and most (average) people don't use RAID.

What are you not understanding about this being a *defined term* in common usage? It means a large number of people have already agreed and decided what this term means and are actively using said term in conversation. It means you can't muddle the term by ascribing your own opinion on it's meaning without being acutely incorrect. It also means people can call you out when you carelessly use the term without understanding it or try to explain and argue that it means something contrary to what is defined.

What happens if one buys bitcoin (say right now) and in ten years it is worth millions of dollars per coin. That person does not exchange their bitcoin for fiat currency, but instead uses the bitcoin itself to purchase goods and services (Morpheus meme). Would that bitcoin be taxable outside of sales tax for the items purchased with bitcoin?
 As I understand it, capital gains tax is only incurred if you exit the investment vehicle back into fiat currency. Since there is no exchange there is no technical realization of gain. It would be similar to buying and holding gold and trading the gold for houses and cars and using it to pay bills directly.
 I realize there are no federal level regulations regarding this as of current but I assume in time if and when cryptocurrency becomes 'mainstream', how and whenever that is, governments will have the laws and regulations in place to make it easier for people to pay or not pay taxes based on their requirements, and to make it much easier for the average person to understand in regard to tax law based on bitcoin holdings.

There is a UASF (user activated soft fork) being activated via BIP148 on Aug 1st which will force the miners to mine segwit blocks. It may or may not fracture the community and miners.
 If this fails, the miners have basically agreed to implement segwit and increase blocksize via some sort of hybrid agreement penned by Barry Silbert.
 No matter what happens, it is in the economic interest of miners to begin the process of scaling. The confidence seen in today's market will only last so long, and if problems persist we will no longer continue to be at network capacity as users will drop off in a cascade over time. It needs to be cheap to use and instantaneous if  bitcoin is going to fill the role it presumes to. The miners know this and many of them are actively lobbying to get it done now. It's just there is a group of very powerful miners within Antpool who wish for BU and emergent consensus. Bitmain being the sole source for most mining equipment now put the community in a deadlock with those miners but the threat of UASF has displaced their sway. Even if UASF is unsuccessful, it has had an impact on the way Jihan and the miners see the rest of the community.

They work with exchanges and have integrated buy / sell options within the wallet..
 While you are right in that it's not an exchange, neither is Bitrefill really. While they're service is not intended to be a wallet provider, they do provide a wallet and handle transactions to ultimately pay a phone bill for the user with user funds (bitcoin). Therein they don't really need to be an exchange, they just need to liquidate Bitcoin Cash and credit customer accounts because they are controlling / holding customer bitcoin.
 Blockchain.info could potentially add a button or find an exchange partner to create said mechanism within the integrated wallet buy / sell feature.

allegedly there are NY resident traders doing business illegally through Bitfinex and Tether, neither of which have obtained a NY bitlicense. the case focuses on the supposedly missing (in the words of the entity providing financial services for Bitfinex) $850 million USD worth of assets that were under their control, and why the loss was not disclosed to customers.I believe the suit either directly or indirectly alleges Tether is not backed 1:1 by actual USD reserves and that the assets of Tether are under the control of the people who own and operate Bitfinex as they are the same person / people... if I read and recall correctly.

You're looking at this too objectively. Obviously you separate your investments from your liquid spending money. The whole notion of one becoming 'rich' in most common terms is to have enough excess wealth to invest and *spend* freely. The idea that one should lock most if not all of their assets into interest bearing investments is ludicrous. That which beckons one should not enjoy the fruits of their labor astutely whilst reflecting on the successes that led them there is as ludicrous as one spending the entire fortune in a mere fortnight. Contrast between the lines of two extremes.
 Sure, put a large chunk of money to work. Investments are the heart and soul of any large allocation should it continue to bear fruit into the future. But at the same time it makes no sense to allocate money you already intend to sink out anyway in vehicles which cannot be used to pay for goods and services. IE I cannot buy a Porsche on impulse with stocks or bonds. In those terms it very much does make sense to adjust how you hold and manage assets including liquid cash based on your new and likely ever increasing cost of living.
 Unless you intend to sit around munching ramen watching your money grow all day, every day, your proposition is a double edged sword.

You're right about not having more than the insurable amount in one account. Rapper 'Boosie' is having problems with Chase bank because someone stole hundreds of thousands of dollars from his account and the bank is within legal rights not to reimburse him past the insured quote.
 There's nothing stopping a person from having multiple accounts at multiple banks though. I have three checking accounts each with separate banks. If I had millions of dollars I would probably have a gigantic fire / waterproof safe in the basement full of gold bars and cash. That's me. I'd also keep investments but having a shitload of money on hand is something I've always dreamed of.

Bitcoin will never be fully decentralized because the mechanics that allow it exist mean even with things like segwit or LN, miners and economic nodes are basically holding power over the rest of the community. But in that regard, it doesn't really need and by extension *never will be* fully decentral. Just immutable and based on public trust. If you think exchanges equate to centralization then you're to assume the decentralization of bitcoin is already a lost cause. The exchanges will always exist, and as banks and credit unions, ETF, indexes and investment funds get into the game this will only exacerbate that sentiment.
 My point being that the public who uses or is considering using bitcoin is still at risk of having the collective of confidence shattered beyond repair should bitcoin actually fail. I doubt something else could spring up and fill the void being that it took bitcoin so long to accrue the measly volume and liquidity it already has. I really don't think the average person will even think twice about crypto if they see bitcoin dissolve as such... It's a niche and a novelty at this point and it would be a serious blow to see it (bitcoin) fail.
 Blockchains are proliferating at blinding pace and nothing has yet to meet bitcoin as far as volume or liquidity is concerned. ETH is probably the closest competition, but Litecoin is the nearest sibling to bitcoin being an improvement over bitcoin in many ways. If litecoin has failed to garner equal traction to bitcoin thus far what makes you think something else would? Especially so being that segwit is active within the litecoin network..

Is decentralization to the limit of what is possible really necessary though? I mean controlling a lightning channel and charging to use it isn't really centralization to begin with, it's akin to using an exchange and paying a fee for every trade. But I digress, all I'm saying is if bitcoin can't do it there won't be some other alternative to come along and replace bitcoin. I think crypto will just be relegated to exotic instruments and diehard users who refuse to give it up if bitcoin fails on a large scale.

The second layer ('side chain') is the main reason segwit is seen as a scaling compromise. There is no need to increase block size and create unnecessary bloat when you can have lightning and competing second layer settlement systems in place. The largest blocksize you would need with Segwit to fully realize lightning would be around 32mb but by the time that becomes necessary storage will have at least quadrupled in size and will cost a fraction of what it does today (SSD, HDD, external drives etc..)
 Even Jihan flipping Wu is on board with Segwit.

Realistically, yes. IF it proliferates and use becomes so widespread and distributed that everyone in western countries *and* third world nations is holding some one way or the other through ETF and indexes, investment funds or just buying bitcoin and holding it, 21 million becomes a number so infinitesimally small that one whole bitcoin can be worth $100,000 - $1m.
 People will try to tell you it's impossible or that the size of the market cap would mean it would take all the money in the global M3  and more to get there. These people don't really understand the mechanics of the economy or trade if they think someone paying for units of something that can be divided into a hundred million smaller units can't pay one cent US or more for each unit.
 Meaning if satoshis become something people in Africa can use and / or invest in meaningfully (Africa being a euphemism for all non western nations) for one cent or more each, bitcoin can easily be worth more than $1m USD. The sky is the limit. 
 Tulip mania saw people trading 25 times the average skilled workers salary for the futures contract on single tulips. While it's mostly due to the fact futures contracts were bizarre and much sought after (to mania levels) when they were first invented and sold, I can draw parallels to what is happening to bitcoin. And the average carpenter in the US makes $45k-60k per year. Meaning if bitcoin mania happens a direct comparison could be $1,125,000-$1,500,000 USD.

Well I mean I never said I use the wallet often.

While I don't use it a lot I can still say confidently that I've had no problems with it.
 If the fee system is broken that's a problem, but the entire network is dealing with it's own 'problems' anyway. I'd say it's more of a widespread issue in that regard.

ETH is inflationary, Turing complete, crowd funded and touts smart contracts as it's main edge over bitcoin. For these reasons it both gained it's own traction but will ultimately not be a suitable replacement for bitcoin. It's running on speculation and VC's who don't know better shoving billions into startups. 
 Litecoin was specifically invented to be a better alternative to bitcoin. Aside from scrypt it benefits from literal second mover status as it was the first viable and widely used alternative to bitcoin. As of now that is one of the only reasons bitcoin retains staying power. The fact that it (litecoin) never surpassed bitcoin and still can't break out of it's range bound trading values should speak volumes. You can't just dismiss it and say "it's not a better alternative.", because at the very least, it is an alternative. The same thing, but cheaper, faster and protected by scrypt which originally meant (and still rings true) a more level playing field in mining.
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:20:16
The problem is the entire banking system is built on inflation and credit... You can't change that no matter how popular cryptocurrency becomes. As in it's literally impossible to convince banks, governments and the rest of the world to change the system already in place.
 They will build systems around cryptocurrency that will compliment the legacy system, but the hundreds of trillions of dollars in debt and the global M3 already exist and won't just become secondary (in any measure) to cryptocurrency. Whether centralization is actually a good thing in certain terms or not is irrelevant. The roles bitcoin and forthcoming cryptocurrency will fill are not remotely capable of displacing the current system in the ways many crypto enthusiast are claiming or thinking they can.
 They will proliferate, and grow in value. But they will not and cannot replace the monetary system currently in place.

Right but the only coin with true ASIC domination is bitcoin. That's why I think if mining and mining pools should or would proliferate, a company like AMD would be in a prime position to manufacture a source product to compete with Bitmain. In terms of actual competition I think only the big guys like AMD or Intel could meet Bitmain now. They have the silicon and semiconductor know-how to do it.
 Anyone else would need insane liquidity and a sea of computer engineers and fabricators.

It's awesome don't get me wrong but I keep thinking we aren't ready yet. Network is at capacity with scaling solution still at least two months in the future minimum unless segwit happens prior.
 I think it'll finish chugging this round then pass out and collapse. It will regain metaphorical consciousness eventually and continue on it's path but it's close to it's breaking point already. Not that it can actually break, just become slower and more expensive to use to the point nobody wants to use it.

I was just postulating this yesterday in the thread about AMD releasing a statement over their increased sales due to crypto mining.
 Unfortunately the conclusion was these are gpu miners and probably won't due much to stem the flow of ASIC based bitcoin miners having such a monopoly. These cards would be perfect to mine alts though because you can switch your GPU miner to whichever alt is most profitable on a whim. ETH is a good example of why these cards should exist.
 If all works out for AMD / Nvidia though, I would hope they at least consider fabricating ASIC cards for bitcoin mining. They could probably outgun Bitmain at some point given their profession has been fabricating processors and silicon for decades. They also have the funds to dethrone Bitmain if it comes down to a battle of liquidity.

Legacy money will always exist. You need inflation at a stable rate otherwise the average person will never outrun the average debt load. Even if crypto proliferates to near equal status as fiat money we need a stable store of value and exchange or the entire monetary system will stop working.

I'd be skeptical a GPU rig could compete in anything outside fringe alts atm though, I mean I understand what the article is conveying in that it's sort of already happening. People are buying the cards to mine. But most of these alts are doomed not to survive because most alts are either a hugely premined scam or have no actual liquidity outside of that created by their holders and creators. Those whom have interest in alts will always prop them up but the market is insanely saturated to begin with and I don't think it would be wise for a company like AMD to sell a GPU miner even if it was powerful just due to the low turnover and questionable future of alt mining.
 An ASIC mining bitcoin would probably sell like hotcakes if they could beat the ones coming out of Bitmain in terms of performance and power consumption. A company like AMD or Nvidia might very well know how to do that. But as you said that's a pretty huge and expensive venture at this point with no real guarantees on future viability or returns because even bitcoin is a somewhat low liquidity market. If it continues to grow however this becomes a missed opportunity as every day that passes makes the mining difficulty harder and the competition stiffer, since Bitmain is constantly designing and fabricating new designs.

BIP148 or the Barry Silbert agreement / Segwit 2x... One of these options is going to activate segwit. 
 If BIP148 UASF fails to force miners onto the segwit enabled chain then it's already basically agreed upon by most miners including Bitmain / Antpool's Jihan Wu and his mining cartel that segwit should be activated with a 2mb blocksize increase within 18 months.
 Either way, the network *will* scale. Those with an economic interest in growing the network (miners, economic majority nodes) will ensure that.

I understand the fee issue but there are several affected services not just blockchain .info
 And the whole reason we got into this is because the other dude claimed leaving my coins in a web wallet would equate to the coins there being 'wiped out'... Which is absolute nonsense! 
 You said "He's right" without alluding to which part of his statement you were referring to then told me it's a poor choice to leave coins in a web wallet including exchanges (which I don't disagree with) but that was beyond the original point; my coins are not going to be 'wiped out'. In the context of that statement the conversation sort of derailed.

I'm not going to argue with you, but he did edit the comment more than once and originally  was just "don't leave your coins on exchanges or web wallets" which basically says he thinks those services won't be able to handle a chain split? To me that makes no sense because a wallet at say blockchain .info is not going to magically lose track of or 'wipeout' your coins post split.

They don't take levered bets on long and short so no matter what - someone *else* is losing. The losers pay the winners and the algo keeps it all tight by ensuring contracts are only offered if there is equal cover on both ends, simple book keeping will make sure they never overrun or sign off on contracts that would cost more than a rival trade (either offered or already filled contract) could cover. I mean sometimes they probably end up paying out of pocket if the final contracts are undersold or they couldn't meet a quota to balance the books but since contracts are sold in specific size quantity by algo the loss should be minimal if not completely covered by fees. They balance the book and earn by collecting fees since that is their revenue model.

I cant say I know of one accepting BTC, but I work in a grocery store and just being involved in the community buying and selling bitcoin has made me appreciate the value of supply and demand, market trending and currency inflation / deflation.

Backed by the miners who spend millions of dollars to secure the network and therefore have an economic interest in keeping it valuable. You never know how much money or bitcoin they have, market makers be damned I think miners can probably influence price just buying from themselves on exchanges. I might be wrong though.
 The exchanges themselves also have an interest in keeping it valuable. This is similar to the miners reasoning though, profit at x price point. And neither of these things are truly 'backing' bitcoin per se. They just aid in ensuring *someone* is concerned with keeping it valuable to a certain worth within their profit margin.
 Other than that you could say it's backed by immutable public trust and the people holding and transacting in it, but this isn't really a backing of sorts either and these factors can actually force the bottom out of the market too. It's a double edge sword. 
  
 So the final point is there is nothing inherently securing bitcoin as a store of value other than the market and it's participants. There is no insurance for anything and no guarantee outside specific companies who might offer you protection if you store or trade bitcoin using their services. 
 I guess it's a highlight and drawback of bitcoin simultaneously. The ability to transact outside of central authority based on a public ledger is always worth something to a lot of people, though.

Also even if mining levels dropped and power useage returned to normal, the peak itself would be a great excuse for the power producers to say "well, this is the new effective average price so we won't be lowering it back down to where it was, pre peak"... Therefore raising the floor on power cost nationally?
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:57:26
I agree to a certain extent, but currently the limitations are hampering growth. It should be moving at the same pace user adoption and proliferation of services is moving but (scaling) is way behind.
 People are using the fuck out of bitcoin ATM and most of the OTC services are seeing a boom too. This is getting real and the network can't keep up right now.

market penetration is so low, out of all the people I've asked including my brother, a noted financial advisor with a canadian MBA, working on a CFA, none of them except my OTHER brother, who is an average joe on the more atheo-political side of things, had heard of them.
 This leads me to beleive that once they become more mainstream they will become hotter than gold, hotter than platinum, and traded by hundreds of millions of average people daily.
 We are still in the dark age of bitcoin. The developers and the initial startup community was the stone age.

common knowledge is something thats a given, worldwide. Like the idea that a heart attack is bad, or that different countries generally speak different languages. Bitcoin is so obscure the words common knowledge couldn't be further from description. I doubt people in say , rural afghanistan, for instance, have heard of it. I doubt that alot of average people in places like Iran, or Pakistan, economies that would THRIVE on bitcoin, have heard much about it if anything at all. Even these media reports are informative one-ons about it where they are for the first time explaining its meaning. What makes you think this is a household thing already?

Well I mean the main reason the average person is buying bitcoin at all is speculation right now. It's more or less a novelty when it comes to actual purchases even when the fees are reasonable and the network is not jammed up. Cash is just easier and a better choice for something like a cup of coffee or a beer. 
 When segwit is active and lightning is enabled along with other second layer settlement systems this won't be a problem and confidence will both return and not wane from bitcoin so there will be no reason to invest in or use an alternative.

that actually reinforces my previous point wholly, they don't even know they can't get the crypto nor will they listen to reason or care even if they *do* understand. the type who abducts someone is assumed to be of low intelligence.. the average idiot criminal who grabs someone off the street. thus I would be far more worried about *my own safety* than any quantity of crypto.. not sure if you're failing to understand that but I'll assume so based on your conjecture. 
    
 the worry is not for the safety of the asset, it's useless if you're dead and of little consolation if you're badly injured. no matter how you respond to the wrench (or knife or gun) you always lose. maybe it's your crypto, maybe it's your life.. or anything in between. 
 the fact that it's *already* been happening to people of notoriety within the cryptosphere is proof enough. for some reason the average criminal seems to have a hardon for crypto, bitcoin obviously in particular.

As I said though there can and will be investments in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology by banks but I am certian these investments won't outstrip conventional ones based on inflationary fiat money. 
 As long as the world is still using reserve currency there is not going to be a financial revolution or a replacement of legacy systems by cryptocurrency (or other deflationary vehicles / currencies). 
 I just don't see it happening in the next decade or two. Who knows what the longer term holds, things can obviously change. But right now there is not nearly enough interest by the public. Nor the banks or governments who could ultimately turn this into a reality much faster than ordinary people and venture capital.

 That's awesome about how divested you are from the bank. I use mostly cash too when and where I can and also don't have access to credit but I would get a credit card if I wasn't so lazy. Not to use it or accumulate debt but just to build good credit. 
 I think anyone and everyone who is considering getting into bitcoin at any level should do it now for sure though. Time is of the essence because I believe the price could break out at any moment. Institutional investment and a user boom the likes of which we have never seen are all but inevitable. The only variable is time.

American oil is for americans. When you consider a first world economy as resource based , we look at sales of volume to other nations. NOT JUST DOMESTIC VALUES. America does have everything canada has albeit a shitload less fresh water ( we have infinite water via the northern tundra ) but america doesn't export any of it in a major way. In fact , domestic demand forces america to import nearly every resource they produce because they simply dont produce enough, and use most of it. This is why the oil pipelines are pumping oil south from canada instead of vice versa. Should your fiat dollar collapse, you would be in dire straits... Yes, your country has some oil and timber, but it would all be diverted to those who could afford it. And unless you have a few mil in gold in your closet, at LEAST, your ass wont be using ANYTHING.

some stupid and greedy fool cashed out 5k bitcoin at 19:30, and 2 more between 2k and 3k = 10k coins total. making himself a hefty profit but excluding himself from what is likely to come. I hope they sleep well if and when this becomes mainstream.
\ on the other hand it could have been a startup company shutting down and cashing out or it could have been a new exchange buying coins to start their business... All market trends.

First you need a wallet , obviously. Electrum is easy to use and safe. 
Then you need to hit an exchange. Localbitcoins.com is one of the best, and I support it because I beleive, along with alot of others in the community, that MT gox is counter-productive to the idea of "decentralization".
 But , since mt gox is the biggest and most used, if you feel its safer to go with the big guys ( akin to central banks ) then hit it up. I don't know from experience but I hear they have a long line waiting to verify and begin trading... Anyway sorry for writing a novel.

Actually if you read the terms of most exchanges you will understand that once you transfer your bitcoin to the exchange they have the right to basically do whatever they want with it and only owe you the sum of your account balance *if and when requested* and universally subject to *their* terms and conditions, not yours. 
 In short; once you send them your BTC they have few obligations to give it back promptly and are legally entitled to make you jump through hoops before returning it to you. They can hold it hostage for months and if the terms you agreed to have language describing it as such they can even take your BTC and do w.e they want with it until you ask for it back. They can also go bankrupt and leave you with no recourse as per contract agreement. Larger exchanges like Coinbase have insurance and are more scrutinized since they operate in the US. Smaller ones like OKex or Huobi are far less trustworthy. They are still technically major exchanges but the possibility for shady doings increases ten-fold with the lack of oversight and the foreign nature of their operation(s).

soon is pretty subjective.

EXACT same situation. I feel like starting my own personal index to look at based on the $17.85 per BTC i spent the first time around vs the near $90 it is already... :(
 Luckily I only ever had 18 BTC to begin with... I just re-bought in on saturday @ $65 a coin but I only have 6
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:13:50
my best advice; GET IN AS FAST AS YOU CAN. Don't put in what you can't accept as a loss if the worst happens, but for the love of god, if you can get in now then DO IT. 
 My advice comes from the pain of getting in late, as in january, but I was using them to buy crap instead of appreciate... Between January and now, I have learned what will likely be the most valuable lesson I will ever learn. Financially and in life, itself.

We also don't have alot of it. We have around 500 billion in gold give or take. The point is , if they keep printing fiat, and the world economy decides to back itself with something else... USD would be WORTHLESS. It then will not matter how much gold you have because your global value would be WORTHLESS. You effectively would have a 500 billion dollar economy based on gold and a few other assets. Ridiculous and destructive not only to your own country but the world economy using you as a backing vehicle...

Debt aside a worthless dollar is something inconceivable. How would a nation even start to work toward rebuilding its credit if it ends up devaluing to the point of hyperinflation? The debts would just climb forever until the countries involved declared stakes to take the ownership of all US central institutions through international courts... It would take a hundred years but it would happen. THEN you would be living in the United States of Arabia or Asia... And could expect all the nicities of a third world nation to accompany that. 
 I hope you're right about the protecting your money part . When the shit hits the fan if enough people don't act quickly and decisively , you will end up in a police state with no money. That would be worse than a corrupt and broken communist society. At least the poor in THEIR countries would , did, take care of one another. Imagine the rife in the US when everyone is pointing a gun to protect their shit? And everyone who has no shit is out to get some? The reserve is not as secure as you think. There are already talks within the IMF about a what if scenario for when the greenback might implode.
P.S. You can't eat gold.

Absolutely not true! Saturday afternoon was the LARGEST volume ever seen on mtgox to date. Look @ bitcoinity for proof. This seems to have caused the speculative dive to $65. I know because thats when I bought in again. The correction can, and did, happen on a weekend. Saturday the 23rd. I left a comment on mon pondering the fact that it could have been a major player cashing out, or the speculative hype caused by all the media reports recently.

Yeah except the fact that they have to associate with something they aren't sure of entirely in the first place. Usually big corporations don't like to touch anything they haven't tested at least in a limited closed setting or small public trial. Mix together the need for third party handling if they want to have their sales changed to fiat immediatly upon transaction or soon thereafter, with the obvious risk in handling the BTC themself...( market volatility losing alot of liquidity and profit in very short periods ), an it is obvious to see why major corps are avoiding it. At least for the time being..

localbitcoins.com , wait for a bottom end and BUY BUY BUY. Theyve dropped $20 a piece in less than 2 hours but as the trend has shown this is likely market correction via panic selling , but as I was reminded by several users in the last hour, every bitcoin sold, is a bitcoin bought. All of this is just more exposure for us. If you stand to profit , then do it. But don't cry when it surpasses $100 by next wed and soars ever higher...

pump and dump is part of the game, were you not here on friday night when the bitcoin buy wall jumped to 10k coins at 92, up from fucking 75&gt;? Are you fucking STUPID&gt;? Do you understand that to keep a stable floor some whale or investing firm or marketplace HAD to dump at a loss&gt;? Nobody jumps a 10k order from 75 to 92 without serious fucking market manipulation involved. Either that or your precious bitcoin devs or some whale of a miner decided to force a floor, to protect it from the easter weekend...
 Litecoin can be used anywhere bitcoin can. All it takes is implementation and acceptance. The price is also intrinsically linked to BTC now and moves with the BTC market. I am cleaning the clocks off the bots right now @ 0.0087, when I bought in last night at 0.0079
 Try that with your stagnant bitcoin market right now. You eastor FAGGOT.

Since you have miner in your name this question is for you! If mining of cryptocurrencies becomes large enough it might end up putting a strain on national electricity resources. They have been getting a nice boost in revenue through usage around silicon valley and indeed the entire US by crypto miners. But what would happen if there became a monopoly on electricity due to miners sucking it all up leaving less for regular homes that aren't even into coins. This would force the prices WAY up and cost averages would skyrocket. It would also push alot of miners off the scene due to increased power prices but that yoyo effect is bad for the power companies. We might effectively be fucking with the ability of energy producers to put up reliable prices and info on useage, not any time soon albeit, but it could be possible.
I hope the prevalence of ASIC mining in the near future helps put a cap on that and limits the effect, should this whole cryptocurrency thing become entirely a mainstream idea and accepted as a new standard.

what a misnomer. Someone has been reading too many wikipedia articles without thinking independantly...  The fact that there is a direct correlation with tender production versus the rate at which it inflates is common knowledge. That is redundant in and of itself. Intrinsic value is also irrelevant because it's a concept created by ancient families of bank owners who had so much money they could literally BUY influences. There is not a single ounce of energy contained in a dollar, or a billion dollars. Fiat value is discerned by law, yes , but it is not backed by law. That which would dissolve should something like, say , a revolution happening. Value is always subjective to world markets and global standing within those markets. Look at Argentina for reference,.

Every day more jobs go to china, more people are layed off due to the economy and the abolition of bush era tax cuts that actually helped employers slip further into non recurrance.. With a downward spiral I don't see how printing insane amounts of it every day in the name of devaluing debts is going to solve these problems that are already present.. If you hadn't noticed the central banks have flopped back and forth claiming that the recession caused by the 08 mortgage crisis is either resolved or worsening, depending on which institution you confer with and what the market was doing that month...

@_date: 2013-03-27 23:17:44
Two reasons. Your fiat is being printed indefinitely which is always going to devalue it. China has alot of Tbills that could be sold as early as 2016 to another economy willing to buy them. Which would actually be a good thing , considering china is basically our 'enemy' and has been since the end of WW2 when they chose communism. Yeah, they are going capitalist, but that is WORSE for the US because the only competition to capitalism, is stronger capitalism. The effect of devaluation is to effectively lower the threshold to repay the Tbills. They are pushing billions of dollars out of the federal reserve mint every day but who's to say they will be worth ANYTHING in the future? The world economy relies on USD as its backing. But who knows where it will go tomorrow. We all hope bitcoin, but that's insanely optimistic. More than likely, it will either be a universal dollar of some account based on the WORLD GDP itself,. OR , another fiat will take over. 
Deflationary measures would be effective. Sell alot of gold to repay debts. This devalues gold itself, the larger the transaction, the better. You can even splinter a large transaction and run it quickly over a period of days to fracture the price of gold and send it downward. Ultimately the goal is to pay as much of the debt as possible, with 'tangible' assets, hard currency, then destroy tender to deflate the remaining proportion so your country prospers enough to defeat the rest of the debt. Otherwise, we keep printing fiat forever and the USD slowly but surely goes down in value until we have a cyprus of sorts right @ home in the USA... The action of printing more of your own currency to devalue a debt you have with another economy is redundant and outright DUMB. And inflationary currency always loses.

not Avalon, I know that for a fact. If you read the article where they interview yifu ( the dude who started avalon ) he says NONE of the team own or use miners except to test them , and the coins always return to the network.
 Butterfly labs, I assume, has a basement full of them running right now so they can stiff half the customers who already bought in of half the mining profit generated by the ASIC... Which would make sense because before avalon came along butterfly was the closest to shipping, and therefore the monopolizing force, of mining.
