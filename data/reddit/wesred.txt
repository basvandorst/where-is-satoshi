Except he gets asked about it in interviews

i believe BTC will never moon again
the mainstream FOMO audience that generated the all time high will never return again
now all you have left is whales pumping it up a little then dumping again... rinse repeat
the average Joe is getting toyed with in the process
@_date: 2019-01-14 11:58:17
there is no explanation for anything in crypto
just whales splashing around
pump...... dump........ let it stabilize a while....... pump again..... dump again
You Get the idea

Can't Wait For bitcoin's quarterly report to showcase it's undervaluation
Oh Wait price movement is all rainbows and unicorns

What if BTC is the myspace of crypto?
What If it gets surpassed in 10 years by a better coin?
Being first doesn't rule out BTC turning into an actual shitcoin one day
Some genius in his garage could be creating the Facebook equivalent to myspace right this Very moment

Koch brothers funded moron isn't a good look for bitcoin though

Fundamental research
Unlike stocks bitcoin has no "fundamentals" to calculate over or under valuation

Proof this shit isn't organic.... just another whale splashing around causing waves
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:06:25
"Speculation" is just a fancy word for gambling
there is no "logic" behind the price of BTC there's nothing to Research.... you just hope enough fools drive up the price
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:21:18
Just bought 10 BTC and I'm very proud &amp; confident about my GAMBLE ��
fixed that for you
Bitcoin is purely speculative not an "investment"
