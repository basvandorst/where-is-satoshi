[AirTM]( is helping people do exactly this in Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico, and soon many other countries. I wrote paper on these guys for entrpreneur class and everyone in class agree that AirTM (and bitcoin) is way to protest against bad currency/economic management that also can make/save you money (except if you buy bitcoin too high and it drops.  Why AirTM dollar account is better for people not comfortable with gambling.)
Basta con los politicos corruptos que roban nuestro dinero!

AirTM is best app for buying bitcoin or moving money to and from Venezuela, Mexico, and Brazil.

I think you are right. peoples rimitting money don't trust apps.
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:32:27
ha. good one. landline of currency is great.
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:48:27
that's exactly how it seems to work-- idea for growth, then investment, then hopefully growth, then more investment, more growth, then look to make a profit.

have you seen airtm.io?
I been looking at this for class.
Their demo video makes it seem like they've got the right approach: focus on harsh currency regimes and then move into remittance once they are established in two countries.
From all my research, trying to build a tech business on the remittance use case is not going to work.  
Poor people don't use/trust/understand/want apps.
They use WU because it's a place they can go and complain to if the money doesn't go through.
Anyone know anything about airtm?  I like their name too.

I'm researching this exactly topic for a paper in entrepreneurial class.
I think you are missing one:
They are two Mexican guys so I am hoping they win.
Here is their demo video:

u r right. poor people don't trust random peoples with apps.
@_date: 2015-08-19 07:04:55
I don't think poor people will use apps to move money. They like certainty of WU and Moneygram.

how did it go? did it work? do you like being an abra teller?
@_date: 2015-08-19 06:42:56
Ha. good one. u r right.

Go Abra seems like a lot of hype and very little actual remittance.
Aren't the people who generally remit money from the US to Mexico or anywhere else to anywhere else generally too techno-shy to download weird bitcoin apps?
I'm researching remittance solutions for an entrepreneurial class project at my university.

Is beta en USA. Only by invitation. But very good app. Very useful.

[AirTM]( is helping many people in Venezuela.
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:40:11
[AirTM]( seems to be very busy in Venezuela from their Facebook. 
This [blog post from AirTM]( explains why.

This is not true. Take out Voxel value from obligations and assets and Uphold is solvent. Uphold is great company. I use it and one of its apps-- AirTM. Why is OP spreading bad rumors about Uphold? Sound like a competitor who has hurt feelings.

I look at both Abra and AirTM and I don't see how Abra can actually work.  Who is paying cost of the movement of BTC vs. currency offboard?  AirTM makes sense because they have cloud money of Bitreserve and compliance of Bitreserve.  I'm on wait list for both of these.

When is the second coming of Satoshi?

Airtm.io-- Uphold app that make it easy to deposit and withdraw from bank systems in South America, Central America, Mexico to UH.
You can send BTC to Uphold, send USD to friend, and then he/she can withdraw to bank account using AirTM which is a Uphold App.

Uphold + AirTM are helping many people in Argentina and Venezuela:

Uphold + AirTM are helping lots of people in Venezuela and Argentina:

Have you seen the [Transparency Page]( Uphold tries to do very good things. Save people money. Be transparent. They are not like banks. Saying they may steal money is like me saying you might rob a bank. But I would not because nothing here to show me that you would. So why say bad things about Uphold?  Uphold and AirTM are helping people in a a real way that is important and fair and good. Why so much hate?
