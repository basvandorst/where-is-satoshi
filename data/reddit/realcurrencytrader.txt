Let me elaborate. If you invested a tiny sum, them this post doesn't apply to you. If you invested a huge sum you have zero responsibility with money, and you should be embarrassed, whether or not you cashed out at the top

I never said I'm a big shot but I make decent money and I know not to waste a thousand bucks
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:31:10
Obviously I'm referring to the people who put in large sums of money
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:45:33
This is true. I don't claim to utilize a significant punt of my education, but that's just the way it is fr some professions
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:36:40
How is that trolling. I'm trying to embarrass people into not blowing their money. I don't screw people over, I only make fun of them

If you don't know then you shouldn't invest. It's all relative for different people. If you dot have any real savings or investments you should be putting in 0 dollars into bitcoins

Those are the best

Just regular lives like everyone else
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:33:16
No clients, it's all prop
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:26:33
I have a real degree from a real school and a real job. I'm considered a professional
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:27:23
I sit behind a desk all day too
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:50:34
I would trade it if there was a real exchange
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:14:06
Whoops, misread that
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:32:54
I should add, I don't work for an investment bank, so I have no clients to screw over. Work for a prop shop
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:31:48
Except I don't work for an investment bank
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:25:19
Are you being serious? You don't think there's anything wrong with not having a formal exchange? Look at what the fuck happened the last few days. And PLENTY if people invested substantial amounts of money in this, those are the people I calling out, and I'm trying to save them some money before they lose everything. I've been trading for a number of years and I know enough to say that you guys shouldn't be involved in this
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:48:10
Yeah I'm trying to save them some fucking money by letting them know how much of an idiot they're making of themselves
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:29:28
Yeah it's called a perk of being professionals who are good at their jobs. When the market is slow we browse reddit, just like every other firm
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:46:37
Again, depends in your salary, savings, debts, etc. but yeah if you're just a regular guy, why the hell would you blow a thousand bucks
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:10:26
I've actually read Talebs books and use his insight about randomness for my trading every day. I understand my place in the market
I dress casual
