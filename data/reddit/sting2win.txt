It was never relevant to begin with.

I hope I get a letter like this someday, so I can give this person a headache he won't believe.
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:08:17
HAHAHA ridiculous

Username checks out
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:56:52
What do you mean by transaction fail?
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:11:33
I am too. But not in bitcoin though. These are great times to expand positions where possible.
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:27:17
Well Im looking at it from the bright side. Everything is getting dirt cheap again like right before the last bullrun. So might as well stock up.
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:43:13
No shit. Captain Hindsight everyone!
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:17:57
Elaborate me on my "incorrect points" then please? Your post is the one that is useless here. Not mine. Debate me or stay silent.
@_date: 2018-05-16 15:02:25
Microsoft still thinks Bing is relevant. Lol!
@_date: 2018-05-28 09:43:23
Because every time in history when Bitcoin "died" it came back stronger. No reason to believe that won't be the case in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:43:22
Haha I saw it unfold before my eyes. Indeed amazing.
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:41:25
You can buy fractions. Let's say you buy 100 dollars worth right now. If bitcoin gets worth twice as much as it is today, your fraction will be worth 200 dollars.
@_date: 2018-08-08 22:53:00
My thoughts are: fuck ETF's. Since when does this market need to rely on this bullshit anyway?
@_date: 2018-05-16 00:19:33
@_date: 2018-08-08 05:51:45
No. Just people panic selling because of a small setback with the ETF.
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:38:29
ETF being delayed. Delayed. Not even rejected. It really says something about rhe space when everyone starts panic selling when it's not even bad news.
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:31:45
This would be true for the projects that aren't getting hardforked into a new algo. Bitmain only became big because the Bitcoin developers never bothered to do this. Sure this is a choice, but not a really good one, since Bitmain controls almost half of the hashrate on the network right now. Projects like VTC promise to fork away when an ASIC is developed on their algo. Good luck putting in your R&amp;D money into that. More teams should care about this, so less coins get "hijacked" by the lucky few who have the most money for equipment.
@_date: 2018-05-04 09:12:01
Alright I stand corrected.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:48:42
You rent hashingpower at Nicehash. The hardware-part is covered by them, since they have the mining-equipment. That's what you pay for.
If you want to mine coins yourself, you can check out whattomine.com. There you can find out the most profitable coins to mine for your setup. Looking at your specs though, don't expect huge returns. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:51:48
Everything is a gamble in this space when you look at it. You either win big or you lose. I don't care to be honest since I'm not in it for thousands of dollars. You learn either way.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:48:12
Lol so many weak scared wusses in this field... If you can't handle this shit by now you clearly don't belong here. Just saying.
@_date: 2018-05-09 08:10:40
People who invest in this kind of crap.. Really..
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:05:58
Lol. Okay purist. So how do you feel about BTC being mined predominantly by big parties, thereby controlling the network and price? BTC is just the OG, not necessarily the best crypto out there. Something people tend to forget. BTC should have forked away from ASICs long ago to have real credibility left. It chose not to. Fine, but I really don't understand why people think BTC will be sole survivor when dozens of other coins are out there that use BTC's base, but have greatly improved on it. It's just dumb. Like the inventor of the 56K modem thinking it will be the one and only standard that will ever be. Get a fucking grip.
@_date: 2018-05-13 12:58:58
ASIC manufacturer is skeptical about ASIC-resistance. Totally not biased at all!
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:18:54
Coinbase sucks balls. Why would you even keep crypto on there?
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:11:42

Fuck off with your stupid shitcoins
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:26:06
Well I don't need you to educate me. I've been in the space long enough now to know what is going on. If you say my points are invalid, I want to hear from you how I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-17 10:26:10
Nevermind I can't get this stupid bot to work lol
@_date: 2018-05-04 08:57:07
I think it's hilarious really. "We are the real Bitcoin! - No WE are the real Bitcoin!" Even on Litecoin's subreddit the discussion is going on. People stating LTC should be worthless because BCH already does the same thing.. Why can't we have an ecosystem with multiple projects of value here? BTC, BCH, LTC, VTC, DASH.. They're all Segwit-based people. Let the public decide what they want to use and stop trying to bring eachother down for your own gain.
@_date: 2018-05-29 16:57:58
Im not. Lol
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:02:10
Don't be too sure. I work in webdevelopment and I really love what I do. I think I will always need that creative stimulus in my life.
@_date: 2018-10-28 13:31:37
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:11:43
For me personally I wouldn't stop working. Only make less hours maybe. I would pay off my morgage first and probably improve my home. Rest of the money would be used for buffer. Depending on how much money we're talking about I'm gonna take some vacations and relax, since I haven't been away for years.
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:40:56
Im running a full VTC node, so atleast I can say I'm partly here for the tech.
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:11:36
No just simple market cycle observation. You can clearly see there is big support at this level.
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:31:52
Look at the huge debt for example and all the money that is created from thin air. If you take that into consideration every dollar is massively overvalued.
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:21:53
P.s. This is not financial advice
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:50:01
More coins per dollar is the only way I see it. End of story
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:35:57
The inherent flaw of this system.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:55:12
Im not panicking tbh
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:12:13
Hey, "Corsa" and "Lambo". 2 out of 5 letters match. Close enough!
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:14:06
Lol we got a purist here. Nobody gives a shit buddy.
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:59:20
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:20:09
Yes. Dollar inflation is artificially kept low. So the real inflation is way higher.
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:32:19
Gee thanks for the news
@_date: 2018-06-12 12:40:12
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:37:54
Lmao FUD at ATH. Every single time the market crashes this happens and Im not falling for it. See you again in a few months.
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:21:09
Yeah to the moon baby. Get an extra mortgage on your house while you're at it. Lambo's for dayz!
@_date: 2018-06-18 17:18:55
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:30:19
No but seriously. Going all in is just plain stupid. I've seen too many people getting destroyed in the past few months. Greed is dumb. End of story. Invest what you can afford, and what doesn't keep you up at night when it's down 50 or more percent. This might be a dip yes, but nobody knows what's ahead of us. And everybody who claims he knows is talking out of his ass. Just stay vigilant.
@_date: 2018-06-15 16:42:01
Oh yeah, and a p2pool.
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:19:18
Okay. Guess Im gonna buy all bitcoin then, since it will be free... Stupid noobs with their comments...
@_date: 2018-06-07 11:51:15
Google "USD circulating supply" and you will end up on the federal reserve's website with your answer.

Nobody cares what you think.
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:56:42
And in a few months you're here with "Hello, is it too late to get into crypto now?" ��
@_date: 2018-06-10 21:06:24
Don't get me wrong though. I'm not saying you should pour all your savings into this, but it's worth it to buy the dips to average out your losses a bit, and take advantages when the prices rise again.
@_date: 2018-03-14 15:12:56
Lol give me a break. You talk about taxpayers footing the bill, but no word about the weapons industry and the military budget? That is the real evil. I don't see this guy designing bombs and warmachines. Elon Musk is evolving technology to help people.
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:57:38
What a shitty article. It's full of typo's.

I laughed so hard at this
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:00:53
Fucking asshole.
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:02:40
Getting a lot of phishing mail with guys threatening to expose dirty pictures unless I pay them in bitcoin. I always laugh.
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:54:02
Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett can both fuck off.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:16:53
4-5 million minable coins left: "hey let's change the alforithm because now it's too centralised!" Little bit late don't you think? Lol!
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:39:29
Indeed. But since this market is still small, and we're in a dip right now, I have hopes for better days to come. All this talk about bitcoin going to zero is a load of crap. It will grow again and end up higher than last time. Like every time it did before. Just buy the dips and ride the wave.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:42:39
Haha holy crap, and I was pessimistic after seeing this dump earlier today. This makes up for all of that.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:53:17
 
"Load ze Korea FUD"
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:20:05
A pull-back before the next upward movement is common. No need to panic.
@_date: 2018-07-19 09:01:37
Thanks for the advice, dad!
@_date: 2018-07-31 17:02:30
Have you seen the buy orders? Not bearish at all.
@_date: 2018-07-03 22:56:20
Lol okay sheep back to your masters then. "Sensei".. Do you suck their dicks too or what? Gtfo.
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:12:13
Ehmm.. But wasn't Bitcoin meant to be mined by the people themselves? So everyone had a fair chance of obtaining it, promoting decentralization? Not just one company with the most money, therefore most hardware, and most hashingpower?
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:59:59
Lol bye wolfie.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:54:37
Dude, just shut the fuck up.. Any guy that advances technology and space exploration is a hero in my book. Elon Musk is the face of progress. End of story.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:57:25
When I look at the price levels set, and the amounts it almost seems this is a single individual placing these orders..
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:59:32
Hahaha yes, this would be indeed the best scenario. And it was like this for a while back in the early days. But unfortunately that ship has sailed since ASICs came along. Now the one with the most capital to buy hundreds of ASIC machines wins (Bitmain). So much for decentralization. Funny how more and more people start to realise this.
@_date: 2018-07-31 16:50:27
@_date: 2018-07-10 22:03:22
One organization having so much ASICs they are the cause of the high difficulty. One person could never compete since he would need high amounts of ASICs as well to compete on the difficulty level. Since you don't want to wait 100 years for one coin to be mined.
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:18:20
Belfort was an asshole who was just good at talking people out of their money. You talk like he is some genius or something. I don't get what you're even doing in this sub. Also it's clear to me you're butthurt as fuck you bought at all time high, and now you say you don't believe in the tech anymore because it's down. Looks like you believed in it back then otherwise you wouldn't have bought. Also it seems to me you have no clue what market cycles are, and a noob at investing. You need Gates, Buffett, and the other "sensei" more than we do. Now take your shit and go invest in some bonds. Nice 7% yearly returns if the market doesn't crash. Moron.
@_date: 2018-07-12 09:46:50
All the money that would not keep you up at night if you would lose it.
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:57:02
Yeah and bitcoin "nerd monopoly money" would never reach 20K. Welcome to the new world dude. Old rules don't apply anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:27:25
I was there in februari, march and the start of april. I've done my part.
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:04:33
Could drop down again just as hard tomorrow. I'm still not convinced. Seen way too many blood and I'm still down 30% on my portfolio.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:24:33
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:48:54
They want to drop the price so they can buy in lower lol
@_date: 2018-07-05 10:22:53
Yeah, if I had invested 3000 dollars in the market at this exact time last year, I would have made the same amount in just under 5 months time. I get why these mastodonts don't like crypto. What took them 10-20 years to accomplish, some dusty nerds achieve in 5 months. These are different times and a different market. Let other people have some gains too.
