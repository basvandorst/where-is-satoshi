Can I make a transaction to myself before the entire blockchain is downloaded?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:02:54
I don't mind about re downloading it, just want to make sure i don't lose my bitcoin. Do I need to do anything else other than saving the wallet.dat file?

how do I know if its the right one?
edit: i did this about an year ago from my older harddrive. I just saved the wallet.dat, the public address and private key.

Okay last question. If the blockchain isn't 100% downloaded onto my harddrive, can I still backup my wallet.dat and wipe my harddrive? I want to wipe my windows tonight (sorry if I asked this already). The last transaction made to this address was in 2013, so nothing recent.

What do you mean still have access to it after copying?

Question: Can I send myself a piece of the bitcoin to make sure I can still transfer them properly? I've only received coins, never transferred them.

Limit orders? People buying large amounts when it hits a certain price?

wait wait, one more! Does it matter that i'm using an older version of Bitcoin Core? I'm using v0.14.1 and I see there are newer verisons. Should I upgrade first or is the wallet.dat also independent from that?

This thread is epic
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:01:14
What if I did?
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:51:22
If I use Bitcoin Core and have my private key, do I have to do anything other than update the block data on my PC?
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:01:51
so I currently don't have a wallet, i just reinstalled windows and have my wallet.dat file, my bitcoint address and my bitcoin wallet number. what should I do?
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:05:06
I have it saved on an external drive, my old HHD and now my new SSD. I'm just not sure how to proceed and don't want to download the 100 gig blockchain =/
@_date: 2017-05-12 06:05:49
Can i install electrum and then add the wallet.dat I had on Bitcoin core?

What information do I need to sell it though? 
@_date: 2015-11-23 22:47:44
What if I wanted to sell?
