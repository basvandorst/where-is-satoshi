So, we're just done with phrasing, right? That's not a thing anymore?

no such luck.  pretty sure there's only one within an hour drive of my place

Amen brotha.  That's my plan as well; some to student loans (or eventually 401k/IRA/savings/etc) and some to BTC every two weeks... 
BTC is way too erratic for me to be interested in quick turn-around gambling. I just want to have skin in the game before the baseline climbs to whatever astronomical number it stabilizes around when it's as well-known and widely circulated as other currencies.

Coinbase is deaded; Gemini account verification pending... 
Pros/Cons of bypassing the broken internet by purchasing at a local bitcoin ATM?  (just found out there's one like 5 minutes from my house...)
Edit:  One con may be the 7% transaction fee - or is that completely reasonable?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:24:32
Yeah, being that it takes cash, I think it's safe to assume that it's a relatively anonymous transfer.
And I was thinking the same thing...  If BTC plummets between now and whenever my Gemini account verification is complete, I'll just eat the transaction fee and use the BTM to load up my anon wallet.

Earlier this week, I randomly caught a headline about the recent spike and didn't think much of it.  I'd voluntarily decided a long time ago not to dive into crypto.
...But then I saw another one that claimed $100 of bitcoin in 2010 would be worth $75 million today.  That one actually infuriated me because I remember with vivid clarity mocking the notion of a system like BTC when a buddy of mine first told me about it back in 2009.  In retrospect, that's proven to be one of my dumbest moments.
I've since decided "better late than never," forgiven myself, and resolved to make a few investments over the next month or so, working up to ~1 coin.  I'd already accumulated a few random tidbits totallying ~200mBTC over the past year-or-so through friends and selling a couple electronics online.  Being that I had my wallet set up and a decent understanding of how BTC works, I figured getting started in a legitimate online exchange would be quick and painless. Its been pretty frustrating that it's taking so long (relatively speaking, of course) for verifications to go through on Coinbase and Gemini.  Though one interim-blessing was realizing that I'll only be using the latter; CB's performance recently and the endless string of complaints about it on are not at all enticing.  
Every time I've checked my BTC-ticker since deciding to commit, I see more money I could have made.  I'm fully aware it's a long-game situation, but it still was getting to me.
If it drops below $1600 I'll be celebrating and buying up more than I'd planned.  I have little doubt that 10 years from now I'll regret buying all that I can "afford to lose." Others that are already hodling may hate me for it, but until I have the ability to buy in, I'm shamelessly maintaining this the-lower-the-better mindset.
TL;DR I'm really hoping you're right about the $1500 bottom. (or lower!)

This guy looks/sounds like exactly the kind of guy from whom you *definitely should NOT* seek financial advice and, simultaneously, exactly the kind of guy from whom you *absolutely should* seek financial advice.
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:54:08
I'll accept you saying no and descibing me honestly only if you help.

Well... Electrum isn't really a "third party."  It's an open-source software project, so it's technically coded by a third party, sure.  But I'm ~99.99% sure that the private key is NEVER transmitted over the web and ~100% sure it's not stored on a server.  That would be a HUGE security flaw.  
When you create a wallet on Electrum, it generates a fresh key-pair, encrypts the private key, and stores it locally. So, if you never granted TAILS access to the web (Tor or otherwise), you could still use Electrum to create an offline wallet/cold storage.
The application only connects to the web in order to check the blockchain, sign/verify transactions, and calculate prices/values/etc.  
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:52:53
Yeah, directly booting tails is definitely a safer plan.  I guess I didn't fully consider the potential problems of a compromised host.
Electrum is, indeed, included on TAILS.  I like the idea of keeping the wallet on a separate, encrypted USB drive.  Though, since all of TAILS' persistance volume data is encypted in a separate partition, I'm not sure it's *entirely* necessary.  Probably still a good idea, even if only to add an element of obscurity to the larger-security picture.
And yeah, I agree that all of this would hinge on the assumption that neither service is compromised, but if the TAILS checksum is properly verified (which... why even bother using TAILS if you're not going to verify the signature, amirite?), that seems like the safest option available.  Of all of the crypto-related digital tools, I feel like they come with the least risk just because of the obsessively paranoid nature of the TAILS community; I'm hard-pressed to think of another distro that competes with them in that regard.  Qubes is secure because of it's sandboxing, but it's also way more resource-heavy and can't be run from a live-bootable USB.  Kali is obviously security-centric, but their focus on offense and all their pen testing tools are again unnecessary.  I'm obviously open to suggestion/correction if I'm missing something, though.
Thanks for the input!

Good point.  Direct boot it is.
