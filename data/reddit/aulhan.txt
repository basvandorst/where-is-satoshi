Bitcoin is not taking off faster because its associated in the public eye with fraud or illegal activity and hence lacks the traction required to become a mainstream medium of value transfer.
It has zero to do with the IQ level of the user.

I believe he is concerned about being arrested but he's not sure what for yet.
Ver believes federal agents could swoop in and smother his future with conspiracy charges. “For the most part, if the U.S. government really wants to get you they are going to get you. So hopefully they should focus on things other than me. But it’s a real fear.” He pauses. It’s sunny today in [redacted], and we are almost out of time. “I don’t think I am likely to be assassinated, but I worry about being sent to federal prison for some sort of made up charge for a crime where there is no victim.”

Your more likely to be targeted at home if a criminal thinks you have a sizable portion of your personal wealth in Bitcoins on paper wallets.
Violence just increases their chances of a successful theft.
Of course, the 'top tip' for Bitcoiners since the Gox fiasco is to keep all your wealth off exchanges, which for most would mean they could have literally millions of dollars in coins in their actual house.
Personally, I do not see the 'benefit' of cold storage unless its off site in a safety deposit box or something.
