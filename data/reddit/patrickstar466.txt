Or tether printing of 100m USdt on jul 1. At least 1 gap is closed on come futures
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:11:32
See how tether manipulates the market. The initial 5B tether print cause BTC to pump 5%. When it is removed, BTC drops 10%.
@_date: 2019-07-03 05:20:54
BTC trade inversely to the state of the global economy. Just like how after the g20, i predicted a dump if trade talk were not escalated and it did dumped to 9.6k. And now it is pumping because of potential tariff on EU and Sino trade agreement that came out on Jul 3. Also tether just printed 100m USDT on Jul 1 which could've have signal a reversal at 9.6k. The global economy is going to experience a slowdown over the next few years so BTC will surely outperform. Alts are dead seeing that they dont rally with BTC anymore.
 Keep an eye out towards the end of July. If Bitfinex/Tether case doesnt get dropped, then there is something shady with tether and everyone might sell tether for btc. Otherwise if the case is dropped, that means tether is legit and the rally we have experience on tether printing is due to real demand and not manipulation and btc might pump on that news.

People clearly stupid to bet on Bitcoin now as Tether has been on a printing spree
@_date: 2019-07-03 22:54:29
Lol I can’t tell if this pump off the recent low is due to trump tariff talk on Europe or more tether printing. They occurred around the same time between jul 1-2

200 DMA is located around 7800. BTC price could touch and then drop like the past 2 time. BTC shorts are dropping fast yet price isnt moving. Beware of going long in this market. Best to wait until BTC break 200 DMA and stay above for a few days to confirm bull market.
@_date: 2018-09-18 03:14:21
Crypto is a market and most markets trade on technicals. BTC is no different and it is whales that controls price and they use technical in their trading. Guess this board is full of people who cant stand negative things said of BTC when it is true. Hold your bag while it is falling while I'll wait for optimal time to buy at a cheaper rate.
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:59:24
Expect delay again until hard deadline of Feb 2019.
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:43:49
Dead cat bounce. ETF decision due in 2 weeks most likely will be delayed or rejected and price will fall. Descending wedge on daily chart shows trendline around 7K with 50 DMA and 100 DMA around 6.8K and 200 DMA slowing moving down from 7.6K. Very strong resistances ahead. 
@_date: 2019-11-29 04:32:14
You do know 3151 contract x $3 per trade for future is only 9k a day for bakkt right?

It was technicals. Being range bound for so long, volatility will sure to creep up.
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:01:08
That bull trap over the weekend when it pumped to 9.1k
@_date: 2018-10-11 05:38:27
If btc is a risk asset and follows the financial market, then the worse is yet to come when the market exit out its 8-9 yr bull market. Come Jan and you get 25% tariff on China import that has yet to be priced in because people are optimistic of a deal that won’t happen anytime soon. And the fed will tighten rate and bring economy to recession. 6k will break soon
@_date: 2019-11-29 04:28:45
Bakkt settlement tells a different story.

@_date: 2018-10-11 05:53:48
Not to mention the false hope many have regarding the approval of the etf in dec 18 or feb 19. Extremely unlikely given that Coinbase is the only us exchange that offer btc trading for the public with the rest being overseas and price manipulation being seen by futures expiration dates. A more likely date for approval would be late 2019 or 2020 when more exchanges in the us are open to public such as Bakkt and proves it can protect investor in regards to security and manipulation.

Youre paying like 4-5% premium to use a credit card for any crypto and on top of that you have to pay interest on that credit card. Not worth it
@_date: 2019-06-25 01:25:20
btc might make a big move after the g20 meeting this week. If sentiment between US and China improve, it would most likely go down. If it gets worst, a break of 12k is possible.
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:58:29
Yeah whatever you say. Thats why btc always make the big moves when it approaches critical technical levels.
@_date: 2019-06-10 15:05:06
Bro look at the charts. Shoulders is at 8.2k. Still in play
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:51:13
if the pump to 12k doesnt occur on another round of tether printing then thats fine. otherwise it is tether manipulation
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:08:20
whos trolling? the only reason btc shot up in the recent weeks was due to trade war fears. you too delusional to know.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:46:38
It might still happen. The g20 is friday and saturday. I said big moves this week cause of the meeting weeks ago. If the trade tension gets worse, btc will surely pump. Other way around if trade tension is eased.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:55:39
This rally is with conviction. Volume is high. After 15k no resistance until 20k
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:41:59
gold just reversed after reaching 1440. Guess Btc will correct sometimes this week
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:20:32
True the last time btc dipped on heavy sell volume btc recovered in a day. Now it’s been 2-3 days and still haven’t recovered. Head and shoulder forming on daily chart so a big drop will most likely occur if btc fails to close above 8.5
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:50:17
BTC hasn't close above 8250 on the 1D, which means right shoulder is still in play. For the 1W, the price has to close above 8.8k to confirm bull market. No trade area for me cause it can break any direction. Close below 7500 is bearish and will short towards 6800. Close above 8800 and long towards 10000.
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:11:44
looks like the bear bar last week on the weekly might turn out to be a fakeout if btc close at 8.8k tomorrow
@_date: 2019-06-12 23:08:33
Go take Tony Vays bet if you are so sure.
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:52:33
It not happening because satoshi is missing. Look at the price of Bitcoin SV when fake news spread about CSW copyrighting btc patent and the chinese media outlet about the genesis wallet. The coin pumped over 200%. That's an indication that whenever satoshi is back whatever project he supports will succeed and the original btc will eventually disappear
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:14:02
Need weekly close above 11.6k and still good for 20k
@_date: 2019-06-08 03:04:59
BTC might fails since it would signal Satoshi is alive and have given up on the project or no longer believe in it. Another btc would emerge to take its place or the public faith in blockchain would be broken.
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:56:37
Keeps getting rejected at 8k as well. Bullish if above 8.2k otherwise bearish under 7.5k. Im leaning towards bearish since head and shoulder is forming on 1d chart. The right shoulder still needs to get a little wider first before the drop.
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:46:17
btc survived because satoshi is presumed to be missing. but if he suddenly appears , who do you think developers are going to flock to? Satoshi of course and abandon btc for his new project.
@_date: 2019-06-10 04:36:38
I know and yet BSV initially pumped on fake news that he is Satoshi. Clearly says alot
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:00:15
July is off the table. They just made a statement a few days ago saying they are patient in cutting that went against the minutes. One cut sometimes this year is possible.
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:23:03
Jmw74 is right. Look at bitcoin sv. Price pumped then hashrafe followed.
@_date: 2019-06-07 07:25:05
Looks like head and shoulder forming on 1d chart. Will pump to 8.2k then drop to mid 6k
@_date: 2019-06-08 03:01:28
We have to retest the mid 6k. It acted as strong support in 2018 before it broke and went to 3k. Then in April it broke up on first attempt. Something about that is fishy to me.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:17:49
lol nice pic
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:40:13
 The technical are all the same at the critical levels for everyone predicting it. 6.8k, 6k, 3k. Everyone was calling those. And look at the charts, volume pumped at those levels before it broke out in one direction. Thats called TA dumbass.
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:09:00
btc might trade in range or slight increase back to 9k until june 28 g20 meeting. After meeting, if trade wars fears are resolve, dump will occur as asia investor will not longer hedge their yuan with btc. Only over 10k will bitcoin be bullish.
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:24:37
Oh dang. Just saw tether printed another 150m right after selloff began. Funny how they print mostly when btc falls. Now bitfinex and tether will pump btc until g20 and then dump if us and china reach a deal to stop trade war.
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:32:22
It could be a buy the news sell the results type of thing with the bakkt futures. Dont forget g20 meeting is this friday. Bitcoin could move in either direction depending on the outcome between US and China.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:13:00
BTC broke 9k yet no volume increase. Most likely alts selling into BTC or maybe its coming after 10k
@_date: 2019-06-20 22:49:50
Volume is low so people havent came out yet, most likely at 10k. Current pump is caused by tether 100m print and gold going up.
@_date: 2019-06-08 02:54:54
head and shoulder on daily charts. Head at 9k, shoulders forming at 8.2k. As long as btc doesnt close abve 8.2k, bears remain in control
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:38:31
Probably after the rejection of the ETF to absorb some of the price drop in BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:54:13
ACh is 3-5 business day so a week is about right. Just because it cleared your bank in 1-2 days doesnt mean it is cleared on coinbase side. Not coinbase fault it just the banking system. For instant purchase I believe you can use a debit card but you are charge like a 4% fee. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:35:52
I agree. The rejection of the ETF is coming in a month and we will break 3K on that news. No proof of custody still due to Bakkt keeping delaying again and again. Maybe ETF in 2020 just in time for the halving of BTC. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 05:15:28
Give it a few days for price to react. If it doesnt drop by mid next week then it was already priced in. The last time a major event occured in the crypto space such as the bch hard fork, price dropped a few days after the fork   fell from 5.5k to 3.2k
@_date: 2019-01-10 01:25:41
It means they took their trade was correct and they took profit already and getting ready to short again. Go look at the chart on coinmarketcap of btc price during those 3 dates. In all 3 instances where shorts were low, BTC price was on a downtrend a few days later. The fact that BTC price failed to move substantially above 4.5K when shorts dropped off that fast indicate there are more sellers than buyers.
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:42:48
There is more users in apple ecosystem that bitcoin. Comparison in nominal value is stupid. Use percentage instead, which is only a 10% drop. Not much considering BTC can drop that much in a day.
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:38:29
Yep. It happened 1 day after I posted. Quicker than I expected.
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:47:23
Same could be said to apple. They could drop to $1 and still function as well. apple stock are traded on secondary market so any price movement dont affect the core operation and financials of the company. only the holders of such investment are the losers. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:31:33
Oh. Coinbase pays the lowest fee to miners that's why, which is why withdrawl is free.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:56:14
Like suspicious that BTC pumped a few days after 20 million was unaccounted for and transferred from tether to bitfinex. Pump to 10k then selloff. Then retest 10k by year end
@_date: 2019-05-28 22:20:04
This pump is similar to the 20k pump back in 2017 when people were chasing the rally going paroblic not when price was at 1k. At 1k there was no large volume being recorded and bitcoin was trading sideways not up. I'm just saying there is more downside now than upside and a better entry point is when it corrects because paroblic moves are unsustainable.
@_date: 2018-12-24 05:27:30
The correlation is strong between BTC and the USD and stock market. Since the beginning of 2018, the stock market and USD went up and BTC went down. Now as the stock market is falling, BTC is starting to go up. 
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:59:42
No volume on the bounce. Seems suspicious. Ill rather wait till 8.5k break to buy for a swing trade. Might just be a dead cat bounce at this point. If 8.5K break, most likely toward 10k before correct again for a nice scalp profit.
@_date: 2019-05-28 03:18:43
Risk/Reward isn't favored now as 10k is strong resistance. Expect a pullback around that level. Or buy back after it successfully stay above 10k for a few days. Too much bulls now expecting highs so we will see a pullback soon. Same thing happened when it was super bearish around 3k-4k and then it went up. Bull/Bear on Bitmex is 66/33, so longs are definitely overextended. Buy back when there is blood in the street and dont chase the rally. Look at how it ended for those that bought at 20k in 2017.
@_date: 2019-05-03 04:28:26
That the standard in the banking world to be backed by 10%. The standard in crypto is to be fully backed 100% which tether isnt. Clearly manipulation on part of Bitfinex. True USD and PAX and those other coins are backed 100%. And tether says its 74%. No one really knows without an audit; for all I know tether is 0% backed. At least banks are audited to ensure they are 10% backed.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:57:50
10k is the place to short. Nice round number and 5 digit. This pump is fueled by the 20 million sent from tether to bitfinex just a few days ago. Until then long until 10k
@_date: 2018-12-11 04:57:43
Too soon to come back when the big move is coming in Feb 2019 when the SEC will approve or reject the VanEck ETF since they cant delay it no more. They will most likely reject it since the chairman mention price manipulation and no custody in a recent speech on Nov 27. It takes time to change one's perspective and 3 month is not enough to do so. Im expecting price to bottom out around 2K-2.5K by Feb or Mar 2019 and then rally towards 6K by end of 2019. An ETF will be finally be approved in 2020 after Nasdaq and Bakkt are in operation for some time to convince an ETF is needed and then can BTC retest 20K.
