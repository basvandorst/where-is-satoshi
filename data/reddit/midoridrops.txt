Oh but man, I remember those crashes back in 2011, 2013 and such. 85% crash followed by long period of bear market was brutal.

That's not what Satoshi said
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:34:36
Huh? Ethereum wasn't hacked, the DAO contract just wasn't programmed right, hackers made off with money, and Ethereum forked to get money back to people.
Anyway, contentious fork is a fork, like a fork in the road, hence, completely 2 different roads. So, yes, Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash. "Bitcoin" no longer exists. Anyone claiming that *their* fork is "Bitcoin" is dumb, and that goes for supporters on both sides.

Or Bitcoin really does need to fix its shit. A little introspection could be helpful at this point.

Isn't Ripple essentially the Federal Reserve of digital currency? They control the amount of Ripples in circulation by releasing them when they feel like it and take in revenue from them, and if they want to, they can buy those Ripples back from willing sellers. Sounds like the same mess.
Also, I don't understand why Liberty Reserve was illegal, but this isn't; Ripple is a centralized entity issuing its own currency.

You seem to be missing the point.
"Hey son, our current banking system, which is pretty broken, has influence on many aspects of our country.. do you want to know why it's broken?" "Sure Dad! I'm curious!" *Dad explains and mentions Bitcoin* "Oh wow cool, I think I'll read up on it more!"
"Hey son, our current banking system is such a failure.. print monies, make it seem like they have monies! It's all a sham! It's all a big joke! God it frustrates me!! BITCOIN IS BETTER! Son, I really hope you grow up to go against this crappy system in place, and see the good in Bitcoin. Don't let me down!" *Kid just listens to this on a constant basis and writes shit down on paper to please Dad*
@_date: 2014-05-15 19:06:46
Like I said, why do people have to use their Bitcoins? They can buy it and store it in their wallets for months, or they can pay for things. In my case, I'm waiting for restaurants around my area to start taking it so I can use it more frequently. You seem to be applying the traditional mindset of having to spend, spend, spend! to Bitcoin.
Also, as the value of the coins go up, users get higher purchasing power so it's a no brainer that the volume is low. Economics 101

I'm actually okay with Benjamin Lawsky; absolutely no regulation would be ideal as exchanges put in proof of reserves, multi-sig and more, but if there must be regulation (at the exchange level only), then we might as well have regulations that actually work, and change with time.
I think Ben did a good job to reach out to the internet community for opinions.. it sure sounds like he's learned a lot since the beginning too.
Honestly though? People need to do their research on the companies they are dealing with and take more responsibility for their actions though. I'd never leave my coins on an exchange. Cold storage, cold storage, cold storage.

I honestly don't see how taxes can ever go away with the existing, bloated governments; tax evaders will eventually be fucked if they're ever found out (if it's possible).
But, I think that with the eventual seasteading experiments, and open source government intertwined with the blockchain technology, we'll be able to see whether voluntary payments for public goods work. I'm imagining something like the Humble Indie Bundle payment style with a fund tracking/analytics platform to see how your funds are used, where they go, and how efficient the programs/services are.
edit: right, downvotes, but no replies at all.
@_date: 2014-09-11 20:15:12
So.. where's today?
@_date: 2014-05-02 06:05:41
I don't think it would mean the absolute end of taxation, as long as the government stands and wields the gun.
BUT! Bitcoin and other technological advances could lead to self-sustaining areas; some type of trade, or experimental zone within a country, or even seasteading.
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:42:13
I'm pretty sure it's already factored in. If MtGox was still alive and this happened, I'm sure it would've caused an insane correction, but with MtGox gone for several months now, the market perceives the current value on its own.
Although, I wouldn't be surprised if a bubble didn't occur this time around because MtGox triggered it.

It is, but it's competitive with the low to zero trading fee exchanges like BTChina - exchanges will likely offer different services than the others for fee.

Soo startups and new services will go with Bitcoin, old bloated dinosaurs will go with Ripple to stay somewhat relevant. I almost see it as 2 different ecosystems, but knowing the amount of innovation occurring behind Bitcoin, I think open source cryptocurrency will survive the battle in the end.
The number of people interested in also dwindles edit: Not sure whether OP is honest, but if true, I honestly think that Ripple will prolong banks' deaths.. so I see this as a battle that will last for quite a long time, unfortunately.

Just to note, it was few members of the governing party. It's good to see that some are taking interest and communicating directly with those of the community. There seems to be a digital money association of some kind, and not a bitcoin specific one, so that's pretty interesting.

This view is somewhat unrealistic. Yeah sure, money is transferred almost instantly using WU, but some chain stores don't seem to carry more than $500 (and this is in a fairly nice suburban area, not Africa). I just got paid with a WU money order, which I'll now need to put into my bank, and wait for day or two to clear. That in addition to the $50 fee. I could've shaved at least $30 off this whole thing using Coinbase and it would've taken around the same amount of time to get my fiat.
Also with some exchanges popping up offering 0 fees on trades and such, you're likely to save MUCH more.

So let's say I bought some coins from Coinbase and I send it to address A on my Bitcoin-QT. I buy coins from them again and send them to my address A. I also receive coins from a friend twice, using address B.

How is Ripple any different from Liberty Reserve? Didn't OpenCoin, the company behind Ripple create the ripples? Doesn't OpenCoin hold most of the ripples? I don't understand why they're safe from the feds?
Or is it because Ripple touts itself as some IOU, rather than a "currency".
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:43:47
Right,  It halves every 210,000 blocks and although there is inflation to a degree, once it's widely used and coins are lost, the deflationary side overtakes the steady increase in supply, which is what I was trying to say.
@_date: 2014-07-03 21:02:59
Wow, somebody is quite emotionally reactive; did it strike some chord?
Anyway, I don't trust Circle either. They haven't done jack shit for Bitcoin, at least not yet, and he talks down on the ones who propelled this thing to where we are in the first place, the "fringe" community that he talks about. He wouldn't have known about Bitcoin in the first place if it wasn't for the early adopters; typical entrepreneur/banker ego bullshit I suppose.

@_date: 2014-04-28 23:40:15
When are people going to realize that Bitcoin is being co-opted by revolving door lobbyists and bankers?
Same shit with Circle. Nobody even knows who they fucking are, and they "represented" themselves as some leading entity with Blockchain, Coinbase, and others with the MtGox downfall. Not that many people are asking this question, because the adoption and price seems to be everything for some of the people here, but it really needs to be asked.
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the Bitcoin developers start feeling some pressure from these people to implement shit that the community wouldn't want, in a very slow manner so people wouldn't really notice. Of course, the ones who do notice would just fork, but how easy would it be to get people to transition at that point?
@_date: 2014-05-29 01:39:09
And..? I don't understand this mentality that we have to be spending our bitcoin consistently for it to be legit or something. I want to save my bitcoin and apparently, other people do too.
@_date: 2014-07-11 07:47:11
You seem to forget that Bitcoin is an ALTERNATIVE payment system, which means.. people are free to use it or not. Assuming the buying patterns of Bitcoin users (buy when price is higher), you're probably going to be looking at lower purchases with lower price.
Also, you need to market it in a way that is appealing to the demographic; basic Marketing 101 here. I personally think it's useful though.. I'd rather have it than this post-it sticker on my camera.
Honestly, if the sole reason you started taking Bitcoin was just so you could free publicity, you did it for the wrong reason, and had way too much expectation from the start. You're going to need to wait until adoption is higher.

Coins representing assets (especially running on top of the Bitcoin blockchain) are not the same thing as alt coins.
Also, those are joke colored coins, to spur some humor. Not to get all serious about.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:04:03
You've got to be kidding me. Dogecoin is what got the "average joe", happy-go-lucky, non-political redditors to start using cryptocurrencies, with many of them migrating to Bitcoin on a regular basis (especially after the price drop in Dogecoin). Bitcoin community as a whole, tend to be too serious and hostile to newbs, and alts fill that niche.
Monacoin, a Japanese cryptocurrency is helping Japanese users get into cryptos, especially after the MtGox incident which made Japanese people think that Bitcoin = fraud. You have absolutely no idea, beyond Bitcoin, how these alts are helping people transition into the idea of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. You seem awfully short-sighted.

Actually, it is *us*, as you're pushing your ideals of how people should be using bitcoin down our throats. That's great if you're going to use Bitcoin solely as currency, while I wait for more features to be developed like the coloredcoin protocol for coupons, shares, and such; Bitcoin is going to be *whatever you want it to be*, in the future. Also, do you really think I care whether you hold and use more bitcoins than me? rofl

There's nothing wrong with opposing viewpoints, but the way people say it matters.
A good example is.. if you're at a soccer event and you go over to the opposing team's side and start yelling how they all suck, you're going to get bashed. But if you talk to them, ask them what they think, and give your input in a respectable manner, they'd likely respond better and even get persuaded.
It's not just about the content, but the delivery. Hence, why it's a waste of time for many of these "trolls" trying to assert their views because they always start with a condescending tone.

I don't know where you got the idea that corporations should be allowed to do whatever they want. Honestly, that's going into An-cap territory, not the big category of libertarian. I'm against the mixing of corporations and government.
Besides, not all Libertarians (or libertarian-leaning people) agree on the same things, so for you to peg people into one label and call it a day is very unfortunate.
Also, what you described is already happening in the US (and as you can see from the Snowden revelations, TPP, around the world), and increasingly becoming highly authoritative so I'm not sure what your point is? I don't know of any "Centrist" or libertarian-leaning government in existence (yet) to know whether it'd work or not; can't wait until !

Why does it HAVE to have high volume constantly? It's fairer to say that inflationary currencies should have high volume because the value slowly decreases (like dogecoin); I don't seem to understand why Bitcoin, a deflationary currency, has to have high volume for it to be "legit" or something.

I actually agree, and I'm also open to the idea of UBI and a **working** universal healthcare. Our government is bloated though, and the drug war, aggressive military, surveillance are some of the major things we ought to not "help each other out"; our taxes would be lower if we got rid of the bloat.
I am interested in the idea of voluntary "donations" to keep things working too though, and I think that in the near future, with blockchain, it'd be possible to a degree.

I can see how heroin or coke could be destructive to the body and the friends and family.
Anything that could help with addictions such as psychedelics are illegal, which is absurd. I know many people who quit their addictions after several sessions of psychedelics, and there are even some scientific studies hinting to how it may help with addiction. Some people even say that the root of addictions can be anything ranging from child abuse to PTSD. You're saying that you'd rather have somebody suffer from their past and mental illnesses, than have them try something that could actually **cure** (yes, CURE, not a band-aid like anti-depressants) them. Yeah, that's really going to help society; we can already see that happening in our faces with American veterans from Vietnam or soldiers coming back from Afghanistan/Iraq, and they are getting minimal support from the government.

Seems like most of the stores who start accepting Bitcoin do it out of marketing reasons; the owners don't think enough about having to train the employees and setting the stuff up.
There is some fault with the services not making it easy enough for brick and mortars to accept Bitcoin (or what the people do on their own; for example, one place I went to had Coinbase on a janky Android tablet, and only 1 employee knew how to work it), but there is also fault on the businesses to not think through their decisions before they go through with it. We learned this shit in business school.. I think it's common for many business owners to be short-sighted with these things.
tldr; Business owners should think long-term and decide what's best for their businesses, use stable and easy to use platforms, and gather all employees and train them on how to take Bitcoin payment in one session.

@_date: 2014-03-16 18:44:25
Your criticism is valid, but honestly, I think that's the whole point. Bitcoin is voluntary which means, if you're okay with the risks and circumstances, then by all means, take part in it! Bitcoin doesn't care if it takes up mainstream adoption or not, as long as it does what it does and is supported by computers around the world. For people like me who don't care too much about how high the price will go, this is how I feel.

If so, it safe to say that the majority will think that Bitcoin is too expensive therefore, people will either move, or the miners won't shoot themselves in the foot by raising the prices too high?
Or is this similar to a "humble indie bundle"-esque payment model, where the consumers get to decide how much they want to pay in fees and some type of fee algorithm finds the best average price to pay?

That's what happens when you have a bloated, possibly inefficient corporation with overhead to pay (really applicable with any business).
Once we get a good app that uses m-of-n, I'm willing to bet that a small startup can charge down to 2%, or make it a "freemium" with more to pay for extra services (such as mediation).

I'm using bitcointaxes.info for my taxes (you can import your buys and sells from exchanges, except for purchases which you must input manually), but since you don't have all of your records in place, I'm thinking that you should just try to gather whatever you have and put it through the website above (or with a tax accountant; this is probably safer, but it's probably going to be hard to find ones that deal with bitcoins, making it very time consuming and costly)
I'm assuming that as long as you tried your best, nothing major will happen to you (maybe at most, a penalty for failing to keep track of all the transactions)

I actually totally forgot about those memories prior to the ceremony, but they bubbled up during my ceremony and it really took me by surprise. I still have more work to do on the memories from when I was 2.. I'm still trying to recover and understand what exactly transpired.
Anyway, I'm just some random guy on the internet, but I really hope that you'll be able to make peace with those memories someday. love and light

Then do it. Bitcoin is a protocol, it doesn't care whether you're a man, woman, Christian, poor, Democrat, whatever.
Get a group of people and get them to use it, that's all there is to it.

Not sure why people are downvoting you. Lots of shortsighted people here.

Did he even end up finishing Dark Wallet? Seems like everybody has forgotten

Well, I agree, but it's also about being mindful and educating yourself (not just Bitcoin, but really, anything). I honestly check every email headers when I get emails like this before clicking anything.

The show is pretty good so far!

Wha? Ketamine only lasts about a week.
Also, shrooms might help you go deep inside, and make a lot of realizations that may help alleviate depression.. but IMO, Ayahuasca is the only one that helps drain the dark shit out of you by purging (limbic revision). MDMA also seems to induce limbic revision, by revisiting traumas.
I wouldn't be surprised if there are some completely forgotten memories that are causing your depression.. I know that for me, Ayahuasca made me relive memories dating back to when I was 2 years old.

FTFY. Also, it'd depend on which field they specialize in.

Why would you drive in Tokyo or any other major city in Japan for that matter?
@_date: 2015-02-10 22:53:56
Traffic can get pretty crazy in Tokyo.. probably faster riding the trains.

Yeaaah, no. As a developer playing around with smart contracts, and a webapp, this thing has potential. The last time I fooled around with Bitcoin was 4 years ago with a microcontroller. Bitcoin has lost the developer edge with all this drama.

So what if I have my BTC and ETH on paper wallets at home in the US, I go on a vacation and come back? I could see it being a problem if I have my coins on Coinbase, but if it's paper wallet, I don't have access to it abroad or at the airport.

Yup. Generate wallets with QR code on a never before used computer not hooked to the internet, print them out, send some coins to it, voila.

because it's shitbae. like a shitty SO who looks good on the outside, but doesn't pay attention to you (shit customer support)
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:49:35
why so serious?
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:22:03
fuck off.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:26:50
How do you do this?
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:42:18
Just buy one?
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:42:18
Might want to just wait it out. I can barely get into my account so it's obviously the DDOS messing everything up.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:17:16
Also trader for... ah fuck it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:16:05
this... is pretty intense.
