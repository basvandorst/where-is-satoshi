Let them come to you - mine have now....all of them...envious as hell because I've shaved off a decade of work before retirement.

LOL comparing a single index who used bots to sustain its pump, then had "$250 million stolen" as the reason for its crash, to global Bitcoin performance. If you brought this to any analyst and described these two entities, they'd be pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital from terminal laughter. I'm having trouble recalling any single Bitcoin FUD more ridiculous than this comparison in the last year. Even if you're supporting Bitcoin as something that will soar, you just can't be applying Mt. Gox to anything except not letting moronic criminals like Mark Kaperles run your exchange.

Once again, religion telling people what to do. How about we all adopt the rule that religion has no place outside of faith...not in business, government, entertainment, music, economics, travel, fashion, ect.
When will this moronic notion that faith in a higher being needs to dictate our every action finally be seen as the manipulative lie that it is? I don't give a shit what religion you have your faith in. They have NO right to tell you how you "MUST" act. Any deviation from this truth....ANY deviation, and you are complicit with the evil inherent in despots using religion to control you under the guise of saving you. Worship your god, just don't fall for the bullshit that "leaders" deserve to impose their version of your faith.

We are far closer and more likely to have nuclear war right now than Bitcoin collapse, as scary as that sounds.

Awesome, then. Forge ahead, my wealthy ex-HODLR! Projections are $50k/coin by summer, tho...��

Its a video. Sorry I'm not so tech savvy as to give a more eloquent link.

Awareness and involvement are significantly different here. There is still a very intimidating barrier in the general population preventing awareness from equating with utilization. There's no "signing a portion of your check to X cryptocurrency" every two weeks like a 401k allows. A lot more people have heard of cryptocurrency now, but involvement is still tiny. This pattern of spike, 30% drop, then higher climb is THE mantra of this technology right now, and will continue for the next few years as innovation continues to massively expand blockchain implementation. Increased value will follow this expansion. If full implementation is a mile race, we're at about the first turn of the first quarter mile right now.

The problem grows when people within the technology become subversive. Pointing to Reddit is easy, like saying the "media" is biased, or the "government " is corrupt. When you generalize you get a lot of head nods, but you're accomplishing nothing. I can't believe for a second that Andres actually believes the real threat is from those of us on the sidelines watching with interest but lacking a deep understanding of this tech vs. the developers bickering amongst themselves over forks, mining protocols, blockchain progression, ect. 
The real seeds of destruction are being planted and cultivated by those who have their own hoes working the garden.

Don't say anything, just pay off his house down the road. That'll shut him up for good.

32.33k, repeating, of course.

This guy spends!

Do they let people Reddit from prison?, cause if you're a US citizen and you think replacing profits spent with your own cash is going to relieve you of your tax obligation, you're going to be prosecuted.

But they easily have the opportunity to add it as an asset...that's a choice they are making. With cryptocurrency, its not nearly as much a simple choice, not nearly as accessible. There's not a BTC ATM in every town in America, but there's a gold and silver store everywhere.

He's so much more than an advocate. He disseminates the short and long term implications of the technology, where we're heading with it and various visions of good and bad implementation. Nobody is gospel. Formulating our own opinions is only augmented by listening to people deeply involved.

Nothing to see here. CBOE handled the volume jus....um....404 error. Translation: eat crow.

Depends on the definition of "quick". For someone working a 40 year career and buying into Bitcoin in 2014, 2024 (just 10 years later) showing a 50,000%+ return vs. their 401k annual return average of about 9%, well....that's getting rich quick. Shaving 7-10 years off when you can retire is huge.

Yeah, but you don't understand capital gains tax I think. Here ya go...enjoy that normal marginal tax hit on all the profits you took from within the past year.
Sit on any coin you buy for a least a year and thats the best you can do, legally.
