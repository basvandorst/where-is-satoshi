Jumped through a bit of it as I wouldn't understand the math anyways. One line really stuck out to me. "A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable." Now I get this, people can be dishonest, greedy and can suck. I recently watched the new Netflix show in BITCOIN. How much was lost in Mt. GOX? was any of that fraud or just an exchange (been poorly administered) crashing? How were the coins here lost?      
        
Another question also, what happens when all the coins have been put forth into the system. There is no more incentive to mine.

Ah, it's more a joke than a beg. I sincerely doubt anyone would put anything in those.

Is this a reoccurring problem you are having?
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:30:55
Yes, but for an hour or a day. Society would survive. The species would live on.

Google is not God. Besides maybe someone here actually knows the best point of reference. (PS - Spellcheck)
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:18:08
You can't be serious. We survived for thousands of years without it.

So in this case, how would the network know which is the most up to date ledger? Would there be any chance of lost coins (or percent of a coin)? What level of encryption are the major coins using? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:11:59
I haven't. You have a link handy? 
(sarcasm)Besides "by who?" Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? NO ONE KNOWS. (/sarcasm)
