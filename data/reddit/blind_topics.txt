I feel like I don’t understand cryptocurrency. I have a fairly vague understanding of the block chain technology, but I don’t understand how that translate into the valuation of bitcoin and others as an asset class. Can someone more knowledgeable enlighten me with resources to learn more? Reddit? Blog articles? Feels most resources are pretty superficial and don’t help to understand the valuation of it as an asset class. I’m interested in learning more.

I found some opinions about Bitcoin bubble. 
This person said, 
"Why can't the value keep going up? Gold does. Only difference is the primary risk which is getting banned by governments or a cyberhack. This is possible but unlikely, at least in the near future."
and added other things.

I think I have to keep mine. 
BCH just got added to Coinbase !!
"Starting at a certain block on Aug 1 they started mining new blocks with a different protocol. So if you had unspent transaction outputs (bitcoin money) then you have BCH on this new fork. Both BCH and BTC kept mining blocks with different protocols (BCH has bigger blocksize). It’s funny cause it looks like you just got money out of thin air. In October or November there was yet another fork from BTC called Bitcoin Gold. (BCG). If you have bitcoin from before that timeframe you also have BTG. Since Coinbase doesn’t support it at the moment you’re not hearing too much about it. One BTG is about $490 as I’m typing this up right now. I have no idea what will happen going forward with that. It’s all pretty crazy right now. So entertaining!"

as you guys know, BCH just got added to Coinbase !And people are going nuts. Coinbase is currently down. 
I see that some of you are using Coinbase to buy crypto. Please stop doing that. Instead, use gdax (which is also owned by Coinbase, use same creds to login) to eliminate/significantly reduce broker fees. Coinbase is for normies and this ease of use comes at a price. 
There's a good reason Coinbase doesn't openly advertise this...
