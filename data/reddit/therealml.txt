Been using bitcoin since 2017 started actually investing in it about 4 months ago. Also didn’t borrow from friends or family. Fees won’t matter in the end I’m hoping ��

What’s foolish is to think you know what Bitcoin  will do. I’ve already stated I’m gambling with money I can afford to lose..
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:37:55
I can’t disclose how much but I appreciate the well wishes and will keep you guys posted, thank you!

Yes, I was about to respond but they deleted their comment. I have assets currently more stable that I don’t  want to mess with. I understand it’s a gamble and I’m sorry for stressing you out.

Not my shirt, just my Bat mobile.

I apologize, I needed to get it off my chest. I heard someone once say to never talk about how much BTC you have and I’ve been following  through with it for the most part.
@_date: 2019-07-17 05:47:00
Not you, I was referring to the post that was deleted haha but thank you!

You can always start small friend, any amount could be life changing!

I’m confident no one has a remote clue ; )
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:02:54
I’m too skeptical though

Don’t see it

Bought in on BTC at 3500 XLM at $0.07 ADA at $0.04 LTC at $56 ETH at $150 and EOS at $7.50 which I bought most recently and that’s my only red. No clue why I decided to bet big on Crypto at the time just had a weird feeling it was going to turn around and was getting smoked in the stock market. ��‍♂️

I’m not able to buy ether. I can sign in on the app then when I click on buy it says I need to visit the website to complete my profile. I’ve been buying on the app with no problem for two years. Complete bullshit but actually ended up saving me some scratch. Tried buying in to soon after the first dip anyways.

That’s Kosher, I think this hits 100K then possibly 1 Million USD one day. However there will be an event that causes most people to lose or dump their coins before hand ��‍♂️

Yup just got verified to withdraw from them pretty painless.

And he’s drunk rn ��

I wish all the newbie posts would be met with one post r/BitcoinBeginners just don’t even entertain them for a second, that’s all I want. Let’s make it happen people!
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:25:00
So what’s the cheapest way to buy bitcoin with cash in the US? I’m a little confused on what everyone is saying.
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:56:56
Rule No. 1 never tell anyone how much crypto you have.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:00:01
It’s official this post takes the cake of all the noobs so far ��
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:34:17
Funny how many post are people calling what they think is going to happen but the truth is no one knows. At the end of the day anything can and will happen just enjoy the ride and Hodl! ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:13:48
Glad I’m still up 76% from buying months ago.. Holding strong
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:29:52

@_date: 2019-06-28 01:29:31
Great timing sir
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:11:04
Best time this year was when it was at $3150..
@_date: 2019-05-08 00:08:30
I like XLM a lot more than XRP that’s for sure!
