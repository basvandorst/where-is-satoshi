Sounds a little low
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:58:22
I used to until we started using purp and it freaking changed everything. There’s shit in there you don’t get with a candle. I think skate wax would be dope adoption
@_date: 2019-06-17 10:38:43
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:26:06
Boomer spotted. You also want me to get off your lawn bro?

Your local skate park
@_date: 2019-08-09 02:39:29
Yeah bro I was kinda passed no one in Hobbs Shaw mentioned it
@_date: 2019-06-03 18:15:13
Holy shit they knew
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:31:25
I bought the good flavor pods bro
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:02:10
@_date: 2019-06-08 11:43:03
Basically what I did if you add a ton of other hustles
@_date: 2019-06-01 23:21:39
@_date: 2019-02-27 02:51:13
balls of steel bro we salute u
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:28:49
Bro when bitcoin marses your not gonna ever have to think of the word afford when you wanna fly your harrier 
@_date: 2019-02-21 04:24:41
I let them ask for a hit off my juul and start tellin em all about it while they rip
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:25:08
Same as a 49% not attack
@_date: 2019-02-22 12:38:28
dude that moneky playing the drums never said it would be easy
@_date: 2019-10-22 11:33:43

@_date: 2019-06-05 10:37:19
Hello yeah bro

@_date: 2019-06-05 10:50:41
thing is we need to be ready for this sort of stuff bro. when bitcoin marses or even moons a lot of people like this are gonna be coming to us asking for donations for their protest groups and shit. I don't want our generation to be assholes to them like the boomers were when they got rich af. we still aint giving them any money but imma be all diplomatic about it when i turn them down.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:42:26
 Hell yeah bro moon lambos
@_date: 2019-02-11 19:50:54

thats a fucked up lambo
@_date: 2019-02-09 15:13:05
define small bro. i would say get into flipping juul pods first but your not 21 yet so that wont work. if you skate try getting some dice games going at the skate park but just run the games dont gamble yourself and make money off the rake then youll have more to put into btc
@_date: 2019-10-10 12:13:12
Crazy part is the answer is crypto
@_date: 2019-06-07 02:32:11

Bro I tell my parents basically every time I see them but it just doesn’t sink in. Gonna keep at it though.
Everyone at the skate park is woke af on crypto though so that’s good
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:05:28
It means it ain’t lambo time yet but it’s gonna be soon
