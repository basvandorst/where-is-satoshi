Paying $30 for a book is great and all, but if you didn't buy into bitcoin when it was $3 a coin and cant easily afford that, here is a free torrent.

only problem is that if you're smart enough to go to MIT and to own Bitcoin, you probably would hold on to your BTC instead of spending it on overpriced textbooks.

Dude, it's 2014, Bitcoin isn't a secret anymore.

no because the sim card is already filled to the brim with malware, lol

Oh hell ya, didn't realize that. Well done Andreas. I probably will buy the physical book when bitcoin skyrockets again.

Wow, so nice of them to not steal all of your btc...

To all of the people with surveillance concerns, this problem also applies to any electronic currency like the usd. If you buy marijuana seeds with a credit card then its also not private. But with bitcoin you can at least make it private with mixers and proxies. You could also exchange your bitcoin for a physical assett like cash or gold if u wanted an old school anonymous transaction. but seriously, fuck coinbase for doing this shit. They are based in san Francisco for christ sake, yet they spy on their customers and ban them for buying weed? Fuck you coinbase

BITCOIN HAS NO INTRINSIC VALUE?!?! How is it that one of the richest people of our time doesn't even understand what makes money valueable? Or maybe he does get it, and secretly is hoarding it all to himself...

Basic supply and demand, the scarcity of Bitcoin will rise, so the perceived value will also rise. But markets will be trading on this information long before it happens, so the price would probably already be set to post halving levels before the halving occurs.

Sidechains and hard forks will kill all altcoins. Bitcoin is just too adaptable because it's open source. Plus what makes bitcoin so great is that it's inherently more secure than any other altcoin because of how crytocurrency works. (The more users the more computationally secure)

Thanks, now I can finally pay thousands of dollars to learn about Bitcoin from a corporation, instead of using all of those pesky free search engines.
