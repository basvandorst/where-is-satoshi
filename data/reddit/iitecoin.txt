That’s bs. Every company hates bad press since trust is the  trait. I’d hire press releases and interviews concerning this topic, send it to them, and create a sense of urgency this way.

Yeah, day traders are the ones taking the L this time.

If that is the case, the new stable low should be about 20% lower than what it was last month, so if you want a 20% profit buy now

S2x is the hard fork of the double cryptocurrency when the data limits the amount of information it can withhold by the dividends divided by the 1mb so the segwit can turn into a flat tire

The currencies are doing too well to keep stable, I will invest with a loan of $10,000 in LTC at this time

Price expected to reach $4,000 before plummeting to $600 next month

It will drop lower, but $500 is safe. Coinbase is already stopping transactions soon, and all that does is concern people with big investments. I have spoken to many people about what they would do, they seem to have similar mindsets. Some just don't care, but most do. 
Yes it will be similar to flash crash, which is why they are stopping transactions so they can prevent upsetting people again.

Probable lowest rate is $3-$5
