The fees on coinbase really aren't that crazy. Maybe that is just me but coinbase is super convenient.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:35:50
I don't believe you. As someone who has moved 100s through Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:11:24
This is not a bad sentiment at all; I struggle with getting sicked into the market and everyone needs to realize their personal value per hour. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:29:15
I have about the same fee for both.

If you really want to see gain I'd say to buy Ethereum. Just relative to the amount you have.
Bitcoin is always a safe bet! I'm a handful of years older with 200 in ETH and 100 in BTC
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:32:02
buy it from bank account on coinbase. It's as pain free as it gets. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:03:42
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:46:36
 Buying it
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:44:56
This will be relevant when it actually becomes a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:42:33
seconding early majority; late in getting close to late though. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:02:21
hindsight is 20/20 and you would've pulled the trigger sooner then now. That's a promise. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:55:57
It might
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:27:08
125; implying it hits 10k in 2 weeks. No one knows. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:54:23
I've lost plenty of small chunks; but that would only equate to 200ish USD today so not really a loss. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:00:53
Stop breaking the rules.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:04:49
I'm pushing for an 11k Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:02:39
We need a flat tax rate. One of my biggest pet peeves about the american tax system.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:16:51
Just because it will ave a value of a trillion doesn't mean anyone will still be using it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:55:25
I'll eat a sock for 15.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:53:49
Let's hit 11k EOY. I wanted 10 but Santa can bring 11.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:46:13
For this to be factual you'd need to understand what makes a bubble. 
hint: you getting mad isn't.

@_date: 2017-11-27 22:47:12
There is literally no world it could be 0 so that's good. There is too much belief in the coin. It could go to 1 dollar a coin tomorrow and every coin would bought up and price would return. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:02:53
Fuck off
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:14:01
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:10:46
Yeah. Or get Alts.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:42:58
probably just a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:53:52
Go somewhere with LBC?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:11:38
take 500$ and put it in a wallet. Back it up. and Leave it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:23:09
also I think you triggered them to cancel bitcoinrush.io so in that sense; I'm impressed and good on you. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:07:51
invest now; you'll have 25% more on christmas.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:00:54
It's fucking rocketing rn; straight to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:32:03
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:05:55
Thank god theyre doing this.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:02:00
Fuck off

@_date: 2017-11-26 08:09:57
Buy now or your other option is to see.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:43:41
you believe it will go up 25% 
then ask if it's a good time to get in
do you want to make 25% on your investment?
this question shows you shouldn't.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:25:35
You won't; we'd all love to see you do it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:53:10
Go to Coinbase.com
Make an account
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:26:48
You should've asked for 100 USD value from that date in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:06:45
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:21:01
Man it's almost like operating outside of any casino regulations in a place free of fiat would attract something too good to be true. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:54:23
yes. Also dead link.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:18:52
I agree that this is will be a bubble. However it's missing two of the biggest aspects of a bubble.
- Everyone and there dog needs to start wanting to buy.
- These buys will start to get huge and loan based. 
The second BTC explodes into the actual public sphere is the second the bubble starts to grow. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:38:09
No; Just believe and buy more.
And if you don't want to; then don't.
