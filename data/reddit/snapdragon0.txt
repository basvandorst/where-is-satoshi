Like everything though, it opens a can of worms, the classics cat and mouse, someone will find a way to send them funds at a much earlier date, and to a wallet of there choosing probably.

It will never be the global reserve currency ever, and you know this, it definitely has its uses, and value, but global reserve currency? Never ever, because - governments.

I can say anything I want, even without bitcoin, just holding fiat I’m still enabled, even if I’m dead broke. This is stupid. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:19:00
Most people will see the ‘don’t buy’ part, and then likely will not buy bitcoin.

Bu..bu..but my second name begins with B, you’re saying that is not an omen for my bitcoin holding? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:08:42
I do think that if a major bit coin farm was put offline at once, like a serious drop in hash power, would bitcoin be stuck so to say? Like the difficulty would be insanely high and not enough hash power to verify the block? Or am I missing something? Because I know it takes a little time to adjust difficulty
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:48:35
Well over my head this would be, but reading up about cicada a while back, there more to this image, cryptography or whatever I have no idea. Good luck on your endeavors anyway.

Bitcoin needs to stay the way it is, as in having a public ledger, governments like it that way, so they won’t outright ban it, you always got Monero when you want some acid tabs off your favorite vendor ��
@_date: 2018-08-11 13:14:12
I only spent bitcoin back in 2013 when I bought some for some acid, was really not clued up at the time, but got my acid none the less and didn't end up in jail, at the time too I didn't  know what nodes was and all other other bitcoin related stuff, all I knew was to open the wallet on my desktop, it took ages, if I didn't boot it up in a week, it would take ages, so I left them on there, what was left after my purchase was about £30 - £40 of bitcoin, my desktop was really crap at the time, stop working so put it in the cupboard...that was until last year when bitcoin shot up, transferred the coins about September was worth £800, since then Iv learn all there is to know about bitcoin, got a ledger now, and been DCA since. 
Spent many Moneros tho, wonder what for?

As much as I wish it to become true, we are all not going to be crazy rich in the next year or two. 
We all hope so, that why we invested, but our heart of hearts know it’s a long game indeed, but here I am, playing the game none the less.

Wait. You are denying we enslaved Africans and helped ourselves to there resources????

I personally think it would be bad all across the board if that happened, but what would I know 
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:25:24
Forgot we came to there land first, took what they own, gobbled up there resources and enslaved a few million of them for good measure.

You do know, if you lost your privates keys for your bitcoin wallet, it wouldn’t take 5 days to get them back, they are gone forever. Just pointing that out ��‍♂️

A trusted family member need to know about your bitcoin investments, because God forbid any thing should happen to you(its a crazy world out there) it is no sense taking your investments to the grave with you, while your family/spouse/children could benefit of your work. Thats my 2 cents anyway

Bitcoin isn’t a get rich quick scheme, bitcoin is needed to be traded, a form of payment more than an asset to hold on to.
