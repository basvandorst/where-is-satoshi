Have you looked into how many people control most of the bitcoin supply? Once the market grows, manipulation does as well. No whale is aiming for a wider distribution

If you use math, please do it with a bit more depth to it. If you rule out everyone below 15 years of age, there are only 5.7 billion people left. Everyone above 90 is most likely out of the equation as well. So that brings that number down.   
Next, we all know the halvening will take place. So if you calculate the number of bitcoins produced for the next, lets say 10 years, you can vaguely guess how much more bitcoin are in circulation. 
  
Circulation in itself is riddled  with ambigous statements. Research companies estimated that up to 5 million bitcoin are lost forever. So we  are down to about 12 million. Than there are statistics about people that hodled bitcoin for the past 2 years and never traded them and so on. If you than look at the amount traded daily, you can further narrow down how much bitcoin  of the total supply are circulating  with.  I bet less than 8 million bitcoin are available to trade in any given time. Fluctuating constantly.
So there are way less than 17 -20 Million bitcoin available over the next 10 years. 
Ponder about that

Could you explain that for me in simple terms? If you talk about being liquidated, are you talking about your account being emptied entirely or your margin collateral being taken?  
IF there is way to use leverage without getting liquidated, even if bitcoin is reaching 1 or 2k i need to know how that works. I thought margin works only with short term trades and you have to pay interest daily?  
IF I can use margin borrowed money  as long as bitcoin isnt hitting 2 k or below, I would be able to hold it until price goes  up substiantially Or am I wrong?  
Please explain

You guys dont have a clue.

Your example doesnt hold up well. If I can't exchange gold nor bitcoin within an isolated area, both are equally useless.  By that measurement, my loaf of bread or myorange juice, have more intrinsic value than both of these thing.   
Both of them only become valuable, if you can trade them with someone, and the other person accepts the "intrinsic value" for other goods

Its funny how people don't see what a shitty system that is and how easy it could be replaced in this day and age.

There is one thing about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, everyone is going to realize. And if the majority of people realize it, the world will change rather fast.

You don't have to believe anything. I'm just stating, what I read an saw across various sources. Also it depends what you could as lost.
A simple goole search would help. Just a few examples:
Fact is, people will continue to loose bitcoins. And even if you count big institutions hoarding tons of bitcoins the statement stays true. If someon hoards thousands of bitcoins, there are even less available. Almost anyone I know has more than 3 bitcoin. So the number of people that can potentially have 1 bitcoin or less is way way way lower than 21 million and those stolen, lost, hoarded bitcoin come on top.
