RBF is only going to make this worse, unless you implement a mandatory wait period after payment is received (like 1 hour).
@_date: 2016-08-28 04:32:57
I've never done it to a payment processor like bitpay... But it works quite well if your fees are correctly sized.
There is the chance that a block will be found that includes your first transaction before your second transaction propagates through the network.

It costs almost nothing to double spend a zero confirmation transaction (you only lose one fee) and it's quite easy to do.  I'm a a pretty basic user and I've successfully done it a few times.  You load the same bitcoins into 2 different wallets.. with wallet 1 you send a transaction with a lower fee (can't be too low or nodes won't broadcast it) that you want to eventually fail.  Then with wallet 2 you send all your bitcoin to some other address you control with a high priority level fee.  Thus, you only lose 1 high priority fee, but keep all your bitcoin.  It's not perfect but it works.
@_date: 2015-12-24 19:38:56

Unfortunetly, big companies are going to have to find something other than Bitcoin's blockchain.  If everyone in the USA participated in Bitcoin people would be limited to one transaction on average every 1.5 years, assuming all blocks are full. That's not much of an internet experience.

Assuming your logic of jamming basically all transactions onto the lightning network won't cause centralization is correct.... Then What's more important: staying slightly more decentralized, but then getting passed by another system and then permanently fading into irrelevance??  Or being slightly less decentralized and allowing the rest of the world to use a system which is not controlled by central bankers and corrupt politicians??

Spammers according to your narrow definition...  However, the first blockchain that has universal utility and reaches critical mass is the most likely to survive and THRIVE long-term.  You are advocating to not only restrict utility, but also adoption.
@_date: 2015-12-24 09:35:20
I agree.  We should keep the value proposotion of bitcoin artificially low and force newcomers to use something else while we hope things like the lightning network eventually materialize and large companies don't all jump on board something else.  I would hate for wide scale adoption to occur.  I don't like it when my investment goes up either.
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:08:47
I agree! The developers aren't ready to tee up a win for blockstream and themselves yet.    They deserve every chance to exploit a massive conflict of interest to make themselves rich, through blockstream's success, even it cripples the network and bitcoin's future in the process.

@_date: 2015-12-29 06:19:12
Many of the developers also work for blockstream.  As a result they have a massive vested interest in blockstream's - lightning network - success.  The only way the lightning network has a chance to succeed is if bitcoin is not allowed to scale.  Thus, the developers will say and do anything to keep that from happening as it's their greatest chance of getting rich.

I believe that in the near future cryptocurrencies will go mainstream and bitcoin with 'small blocks' will not allow that to happen.  Do some basic math and it becomes obvious.  Thus, if cryptocurrencies go mainstream another coin will have taken the lead.  The world will not hold itself back and wait for bitcoin to get its shit together
@_date: 2015-12-26 18:07:47
0 conf might not have been safe, but it was safe enough for most small point of sale transactions like buying a coffee or sandwich.  Now.... Not only is it not safe, but it takes way way way to long to do a transaction as there is often a backlog of transaction and you have to wait for a confirmation.....  If Bitcoin were a business Peter Todd would be looking for a new job.
If a business destroyed its payment network utility, such as limiting growth and innovation (through capacity constraints) and making bricks and mortar point of sale transactions impossible, then I would expect its value to fall as current prices reflect expected potential and bitcoin has just greatly limited its expected potential.
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:12:15
Great example about Netscape allowing millions of people to "get a taste of the internet". However, if even 2 million tried to use Bitcoin only once it would take over 3 days for the network to process the transactions.  Meanwhile, they would all say "OMG my transaction is stuck and Bitcoin is broken" and would get frustrated and probably stop using Bitcoin.... That's not much of a "good taste" and I doubt they'd come back for seconds.

Bitcoin worked properly and had lots of utility during this time period.  Its relative utility is about to fall drastically... So yes cryptocoins aren't going anywhere, but bitcoin could fall into irrelevance.

Only big miners can profitably exist right now.  Where are these small miners you're talking about???  I once made a business plan to create a $100k mining operation and found that there was no chance in hell of making money.  Since then, the mining situation has only gotten worse as the hashrate has skyrocketed and the price hasn't followed.
The days of small miners are over.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:47:33
Or it is not worse... if you put 2 seconds of imagination towards thinking about it you would realize it could be solved by the merchant stating their required minimal fee... if you attach "x" level of fee I'll give you your widget at 0 conf... if you don't then you will have to wait for a confirmation..

Most of them are actually people that came into Bitcoin @ 2013 or earlier who became disenfranchised in 2015-2016 when blockstream and theymos changed bitcoin's direction to a crippled settlement network vision (instead of electronic peer to peer cash) that is too small and expensive to use for the developing world, everyday businesses and the general user (Andreas Antonopoulos sold us on changing the world... Which is not going to happen anytime soon based on the current rate of progress).  Bitcoin's current path is robbing it of 99% of its true potential by artificially restricting its capacity/growth and rewriting it's code to become complicated (which locks in the need to keep the core developers) to set the stage for blockstream's lightning network (which core has put in a data cost subsidization into the current segwit SF code).  Also, because the moderators here cenzor most comments that go against blockstream/core and only really allow negative posts about BU or Roger V and whatnot is just fuel for the rivalry fire.
That's the beef between R/btc and r/Bitcoin.

@_date: 2016-03-13 16:29:07


It appears to be working okay **IF** you don't mind paying more for slower transaction times **AND IF** you don't mind the bait-and-switch drop in utility from developers making bitcoin into a settlement system **AND IF** don't mind that bitcoin's adoption rate has artificially stalled at 1/10,000 of the world population **AND IF** you don't mind that bitcoin no longer has a chance to revolutionize anything when it's already at capacity.

Because then it can actually add to their bottom line.... Eventually....  The average walmart purchase is $93/customer... And bitcoin could save them maybe 0.75% per transaction or $0.70/transaction... And bitcoin can handle 3.5 transactions per second and assuming 2-5% of all bitcoin transactions are devoted to walmart then right now bitcoin could save Walmart maybe as much as $1200-$3000 per day... Which is basically nothing when you earn $130,000,000,000/year in profit (bitcoin could add a maximum of about 0.0008% improvement...). But one day when bitcoin scales it could maybe do some good!!!

to propagate information through that many nodes would be a nightmare.  As the network gets larger less nodes per users are required to be optimal.  overall as bitcoin grows so should its node count, but not proportionately to users.

Bitcoin's uses of 'peer to peer' and having 'business utility' are not mutually exclusive.  It is not either or... They both exist at the same time.  Killing one of them...

Bitcoin is going to drop a lot further as investors change their assessment on its severely restricted future.  However; after it falls into the 200s you will see even more 'real' talk about forking.  And once it looks like it is going to break through the 200s bitcoin will actually fork very quickly.  Afterwards, the sky is the limit as far as price is concerned, becasue growth and utility will not be restricted.
Tldr: price will fall until a fork occurs.  Then price goes up.

I don't have an issue with what the core developers do after they move on.  I don't have an issue with blockstream's business model either.  
I have an issue with the core developer's receiving Blockstream stock and then hot wiring the network to coincide with blockstream's business model requirement of an at capacity ecosystem.  I don't actually know that the core developers received stock... But it is extremely likely given that basically all tech start-ups lockdown key employees in this way.  It would be very very naive assume otherwise.  As human nature has proven millions of times throughout history people are selfish and act in their own best interests.  The core developers best interest is likely linked to setting up a win for blockstream (to maximize their stock holdings) regardless of whether or not it restricts bitcoin's capacity and cuts off the other 9,999/10,000 people on earth.

And there was no rollback.  The chain was forked to nullify the DAO contract before the withdrawal date was hit which would have allowed the hacker to steal almost everything.  Hence nothing was rolled back, only stopped from proceeding further.  People still had to manually withdrawal their ethereum from the DAO afterwards.

Regarding segwit and MW extension block:. This just shows how poorly core prioritizes.  Segwit is far from a done deal and yet they are building off of it as if it was a sure thing.  The horse has to come before the cart and right now it's looking like the market doesn't even want to use core's cart.

Yeah, I blew that last reply with a thoughtless autopilot response.  For real now... this is my last reply.  No one is proposing changing its peer to peer nature.  Bitcoin by its very nature does not use a middle man and allowing it to scale does not change that.  Allowing businesses to easily accept and use bitcoin does not require it be changed from peer to peer to being centralized.  There will never be bitcoin middleman clearinghouse as that takes away from the whole point of using a blockchain.  However, killing its 'business utility' likely kills bitcoin.

After being in for years, I divested of Bitcoin some time ago because the economic fundamentals stagnated under the current leadership.

Walmart or amazon would never accept bitcoin as is.   Even if all 3.5 transactions per second on the bitcoin network were devoted to Amazon or Walmart it would have a negligible effect on their bottom lines.  Bitcoin has almost no utility with its restricted capacity right now....  It's kind of like someone talking about running the entire public transit system of Chicago by only using their 1 car for carpooling.  This is why bitcoin needs to scale.
@_date: 2016-01-16 01:36:44
If any of those merchants are bricks and mortar they will be in for a surprise as they either will have to insist their customers wait for long periods of time (possibly hours for a confirmation) or risk a type double spend if they let their customer leave.  
This is why we need change.  It sure makes risk management tough for merchants when the core devs publish programs for double spending and keep an obsolete block size restriction in place.
@_date: 2016-01-02 01:40:36
Better yet, let's keep the network capacity tiny and do nothing as we wait for the lightning network to be created and released.  We need the lightning network because it helps reduce spam by killing investment and businesses that would otherwise build on top of the network.   I'm sure the world will wait, no matter how long it takes for the LN and bitcoin will remain the golden standard.... This is the most fool proof plan ever!  We should all support our core developers because they know economics!  Like how could this go wrong???
@_date: 2016-01-27 01:08:58
I applaud core for improving communication and speaking out against censorship. However, I feel they still need to make a public declaration of any stock or options they have in Blockstream.  I only feel this way because it appears Blockstream and the Lightning Network would greatly benefit from changing the economic environment of the bitcoin ecosystem, regardless of whether or not it is in everyone's best interest.  The bitcoin public should be made aware of whether or not our "leaders" are being incentivized to try and influence the direction of bitcoin's development.  Furthermore, history has shown that not only do people act in their own best interests but also tech companies use their stock to lockdown key individuals and to keep those individuals acting on the company's behalf.

Obv you do not own a business and deal with problems of how to set up systems and processes.  Unless everyone on both sides of the transaction understands everything perfectly it is going to take forever as people struggle to grasp what is going on and whether or not it has all been taken care of.  Which will result in the business owner saying: **** this... I'm losing way too much in lost sales through lack of productivity.... No more bitcoin, people can pay with regular methods.  
All of this is assuming the business owner even decided to accept bitcoin in the first place... As it is ridiculously complicated to begin with... RBF only makes things more complicated which will kill adoption and likely stop people from taking the initial plunge.  Just remember: you are not representative of the general public.  The average person is borderline retarded with technology and very cautious.

I run a node btw.  Suppose bitcoin added 300 million new users.  How many do you think would want to run a node? 0.01%? well even if its 0.01% that still 30,000 new nodes.  Not sure how that's a middleman clearing house or makes it centralized...  for every 300 million people there are probably at least 30,000 people willing to do pretty much anything regardless of the incentives.

We should ignore this tool, and we should keep telling everyone 0conf is safe.
No one is saying large scale transactions with 0 conf is safe, but Bitcoin should have the "utility" of being good for small point of sale bricks and mortar  transactions, such as buying a coffee, newspaper, sandwhich, etc.  For the most part bitcoin did have this utility because it rather complicated for the layman user to double spend attack and because some bricks and mortar businesses are willing to accept bitcoin.  
Now this utility is all but lost because has not only made zero conf worthless, but he is also advocating keeping the bitcoin cap at 1mb which means waiting for a confirmation will take too long for basically all bricks and mortar businesses.  
Peter Todd should be trying to increase bitcoin's utility to increase adoption, not destroy utility.  He should not be given the title of "Bitcoin Expert" in this subreddit as this implies he knows the bitcoin ecosystem when in reality all he knows is coding and cryptography.

Basic math says no.  Bitcoin can handle: 3 transactions/sec * 60 sec/min * 60 min/hr * 24 hr/day = 259,200 transactions/day
As per Google: India has 1.333 Billion people or 1,333,000,000.
Thus if India were to adopt Bitcoin and everyone made ONLY a single transaction it would take: 1,333,000,000/259,200 = 5,143 days or 14 years to include everyone in a block and this assumes no other people use bitcoin in the meantime....

Well they would probably do it indirectly to avoid direct criticism and blame... Next they would probably find some convoluted complicated code they would want to push into bitcoin to stall its progress.  This code would have to be justified so they need the right people to talk it up and dispute everything else.  So, to do that they would probably have to hire a bunch of core developers to push their agenda.  In order to do that indirectly, they would have to set up an investment vehicle/fund to gain enough control over a relevant bitcoin related company that could then hire these core developers to then push the bank's agenda.  Next they would have to crush dissenters through censorship and smear campaigns...

What about the fact bitcoin is basically at capacity and if even 10% of the population of Argentina adopted bitcoin the average person would only be able to send a single transaction every 30 or so days, regardless of the fee they attach....   People aren't rich there so I doubt they would want to pay large fees to make basic transactions.  It's not word of mouth.  It's the fact that bitcoin cannot accommodate them for a decade or so if we follow Core's scaling road map.  Meanwhile... Their currency will likely implode and they will be forced to adopt something else because bitcoin isn't ready.... Bitcoin is going to miss its chance.  No matter how much you down vote me....

Skipping iterations means smarter work.  Just like quantum computing will be able to accomplish greater tasks with the same amount of energy.

Trying to play down the importance of this by calling it a routine checkup is terrifying.  Look at the value slippage happening right now.  Almost every single alt coin has doubled or tripled and another major alt competitor has seen its market cap increase by a factor 7 and liquidity increase by a factor of 30+.  Bitcoin may be at the top now, but we can't take these things for granted... Every leader eventually falls and is surpassed and by keeping bitcoin artificially constrained we are only speeding this process up..These alts are surging not because they are good, but because bitcoin has stagnated and is not worth developing on or investing in at the moment.

Cheap transactions are a fundamental part if you want bitcoin to be useful to more than 1/10,000 people.  Right now only 1/10,000 people on earth can use it... and they hardly use it... and it's about to get more expensive... i don't see how that is a recipe for success.  Yes it's going to become a little cooler with smart contracts... but no one actually cares besides a few hundred tech savvy people.   And even if those tech savvy people created some really cool smart contract applications it doesn't matter because bitcoin has such a tiny capacity anyways that it would be economically unviable.  Bitcoin's stomping grounds should be third world countries where governments are corrupt and fiscally irresponsible.  Instead bitcoin is about to get less useful through constrained capacity and by becoming more expensive.  20 cents might not be much to you, but to someone in the third world it's a lot.

I recently had to learn to double spend a zero conf transaction because I sent a large sum without a fee and my btc was stuck in limbo.  Double spending is not hard at all.  All you need is two different wallet apps holding the same bitcoin.   First you send one with a low fee and then you use your other wallet app holding the same bitcoin and send with a high fee.  Really easy to do and people could easily scam you.

You need a bit of a factor of safety with your fee if you need it to go through in the next block... cuz what happens if there isn't a block found for an hour or more and now many people are outbidding you to get into the next block.  It's not like you can just simply adjust your fee to compensate mid conversation at the restaurant table.
