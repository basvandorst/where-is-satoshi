They don't seem to list prices on their website; why is that?

I found [ which suggests [Vultr]( (as a couple of people here have suggested; ETA: but which doesn't accept Bitcoin for setting up new accounts), and also [Cloudways]( (ETA: which [no longer accepts Bitcoin]( [Bithost]( (ETA: which seems to be working, minimum payment US$10, via coinpayments.net, successfully launched a server after awaiting two confirmations), and [NETdepot,]( although that one seems to be US-only. (It also mentions another service that doesn't list per-hour prices.)

As explained in [my comment above]( Vultr doesn't accept Bitcoin for setting up new accounts.

I don't have an AWS account or a credit card.

I want to solve their problems, not give them new ones.

This provider doesn't seem to offer a per-hour option, just a per-month option, so it isn't what I was asking for. Unless there's a page I'm missing?

Thank you!
Edit: looks like they don't accept Bitcoin for setting up new accounts; [their page]( says, "Account must be funded by credit card or PayPal before making a Bitcoin deposit."

There's no such thing as a free checking account anywhere in the country, but in any case I can't open a checking account. That's why I'm using Bitcoin in the first place.
