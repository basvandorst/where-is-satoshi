The U.N. seized or froze Iran's financial assets, did they not? What if those assets were stored as Bitcoin, what could the U.N. do? What if this spells the end of the petrodollar and oil sales begin to be denominated in Bitcoin?
This technology could turn the world on its head.

Glad you enjoyed the article! I either convert that tip into a local IPA or pay it forward... :)

That's amazing. Thanks for the thoughtful explanation. It seems vendors don't have a problem constantly adjusting prices upward but I can see how psychologically difficult it would be to see my paycheck adjusted downward after living under an inflationary currency my whole life.

They missed the point of that last question. A bitcoin that has been spent (transferred to a vendor for example) can of course be spent by that vendor, in the same manner as a cash transaction. /preaching to the choir

I agree, *you* should sell.

Good luck! Here are a couple of other videos that I think are helpful to understand the big picture.

Thanks. I don't think my audience is ready for that just yet. I'll have to see if they respond with follow up questions.

If prices move with currency supply, why not keep currency supply constant instead?

That'll do thanks!

I can't believe I heard Tony Fratto actually say "Limited supply is not a feature of money". What?

It is dangerous to the integrity of Bitcoin, I believe, opens up network to the risk of a double spend?

Interesting to hear about Bitcoin in the context of other world changing trends. This guy should do a Ted talk.

I just renewed my Verizon contract on an iPhone. I am seriously considering letting that go and switching to an Android device based on this issue alone. Dammit.

He clarified that money supply should be allowed to grow with the economy and contract as needed.

Pay it forward! That's the really fun part.

Twist: He actually does steal their private key.
