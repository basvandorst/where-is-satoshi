There have to be some people. I've heard of friends of friends who live on no money at all in this society (no bitcoin either) and they have been doing well.

Nice! I'll try to do that next! :)

There is a disclosure right after the article.

Thanks! I'm checking it out. :)

I like this! How do you pay for the wireless data services and utilities?

Yes! They have a lot of friends who they share with. They live a very minimal life with almost no possessions and that helps them live a much more fruitful spiritual life. They use couchsurfing and craigslist as well as other community driven services.

I'm in Florida right now but I live a little bit everywhere. I just want to see more and more people not accepting any fiat currencies or any fully centralized currencies designed to impose monetary policy. Are you in Isle of man?

Homeless! That's freedom, not having any material garbage holding you down. Why can't you use Gyft? Did they block you?

You can use Brawker ( to have somebody buy you a Starbucks card eGift with a discount
That'll be really fast and will help spread bitcoins to many people.

If you want to use Brawker to sell bitcoins for fiat, you can do it too. Just be careful with what you accept in exchange. A physical product is just like bitcoin in this way, once you have it in your hands, it's yours. Only the use of force can take it away. Credit Card and Paypal transactions can be reversed, but once you have your product, you can safely give your bitcoins to the person who got it for you.

You should try using Brawker instead! :) 
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:33:00
Yes! Banks want to know everything about everyone and they will censor you (your transactions) if they feel like it. I've had that happen. :) I also want to use as many decentralized services as possible. I don't want to be exposed to much censorship. I want to work person to person without much contact with centralized corporations. I'd love to meet you and your husband one day! I'm so happy to see people are moving away from fiat.

Too bad it's only for Canada. :(

How do you pay for utilities for example?

Thank you rydan for the note. I though my account was a sufficient disclaimer but I should have added a written disclaimer. I'm not trying to hide anything. You obviously can see that I'm trying to help Brawker. In this case, I'm doing it because I'm a happy Brawker user, even though I also help make Brawker better by helping the founders improve the platform.

I haven't bought any bitcoins on any of them. However, I've purchased several things with bitcoins on Brawker. And so far I had a great experience. I'm actually expecting something in the mail right now.  :)  I think the orders get picked up quite quickly and so there are not many orders live. Brawker has a few live right now.

I'm with Brawker and I've actually used Brawker to buy Portal and Portal 2 with with Bitcoins from Steam. It was super fast since Steam takes credit cards. I got a 20% discount with Brawker on top a huge sale discount that Steam had! :)
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:25:41
Haha great pictures! Yeah, it's definitely not there yet. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 11:09:56
I might give it a try! :)

Brawker has a fraud protection system in place to prevent this type of scenarios. Amazon and most e-commerce platforms also have similar systems.
