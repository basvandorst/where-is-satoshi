"Run a full node" is just a complicated way to say "install bitcoin core on some computer and let it run".
Once this is done, there are a few tweaks that can be done to improve your node's reachability and usefulness. This community will help if you have questions.
Don't let "run a full-node" sound impressive. If you want to do it, you can probably do it!

That's an entirely different issue.
OP was talking about paper money being exchangeable for precious metals, preventing the issuance of unlimited amount of paper money.
What you are talking about is the era when coins were themselves made of precious metal and were accepted at face value, not by weighing them, creating the incentive to shave off a bit of that precious metal, because coins still retained their value. See 
With current coins made of boring metal, that is no longer a problem and the grooves on the outside of coins are there for... pick any: aesthetic or ease of identification.

I believe so, but they have to increase capacity faster than they are increasing userbase. Also, increasing capacity has many shades... increasing capacity to serve HTTP clients is different from increasing capacity of the engine. So if they are currently improving capacity, what are they talking about and why doesn't it result in better user experience?
I'm not calling them a fraud as some do, I mostly trust them with safeguarding my money. But being unable to trade defeats the purpose of an exchange and costs users money.
I can't understand the lack of proper communication on their difficulties... not publicly acknowledging a problem doesn't solve it, nor does it make it disappear.

Good info.
One of my nanoS died in may, got an "exchange ticket" number in the 20k... waited 7 months before sending it back, got another exchange ticket number in the 80k.
So about 10k exchanges per month and if they ship 1m per year, that is 100k per month. That'd equate to a rather high 10% failure rate.

Was this your first Kraken withdrawal?
Because my first withdrawal was fast too, but last week, it took 7 days to arrive...
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:42:59
According to their FAQ, I overreacted (or rather, reacted too quickly).
From the day where I requested a withdrawal, money was no longer showing on my balance. If we consider that Fidor respects the SEPA rules, from an accounting point of view, where was this money showing up? I think that is an interesting question, regarding customer money that "disappeared" during a reserve audit...
I see a few ppl complaining about banks supposedly delaying SEPA transactions for their own profit. What is Kraken doing exactly, what is the cause of those delays?
@_date: 2014-03-25 09:55:14
Yes I am tier 3 verified and did not reach any limit.
On kraken's site, withdrawal status is "success" (this function has to be improved, I want to see an history of withdrawal events... like when withdrawal status changes)
Support's only mail message was a confirmation that it was a success, so this excludes any limit problem.
And I didn't mention "same amount", but withdrawal to same account, of a slightly different amount than first time.
I'm sure they are trying to improve.
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:35:12
I don't think theoretical is the right term there. I'd favor "contractual".
Obviously, breaches of contract/rules are not unusual, unless there is some technical measure making it impossible. When it happens, you ask for explanations.
Which is why I'm asking for a timeline regarding my withdrawal.
I'd like to understand whether Kraken delayed/messed up the SEPA order with Fidor, whether Fidor delayed processing of the order, or something else.
Understanding my risk exposure is key.
Should I trust Kraken? Maybe nothing is wrong on their side, but their business partner didn't do what it was supposed to do?
What's the point of auditing Kraken if the risk is Fidor, and you have to go through fidor in order to trade fiat-crypto?

I fully agree with that, I understand SEPA rules do not apply to Kraken but to their banking partner.
But IMO, Kraken deliberately blurs the lines.
When looking at a withdrawal details on Kraken's site, I want to understand the difference between the following status:
* request received by Kraken
* request processed by Kraken
* request received by their banking partner
* request processed by their banking partner
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:46:30
Maybe because I've had to implement such things in similar situations... and because if you are a dev, you tend to make models of everything, not based on how things look, but how they have to be implemented ;)
@_date: 2014-03-25 12:15:00
Exactly, it is important to know responsibility boundaries, and when your money crosses those boundaries.
I am 100% confident that in Kraken's backoffice system, they have different status codes for a withdrawal request that was received and one that was forwarded to their bank... because they need to handle cases such as wrong BIC/IBAN.
Why this important detail is not available to customers is anyone's guess... but in any case, it is a deliberate choice to not make it available.
@_date: 2014-03-25 09:40:54
I mostly have a problem with their lack of communication.
Regarding the audit, the only thing it proves is that they hold some bitcoins. Not that they hold enough bitcoins to cover all customers assets.
So maybe this is valuable, but I don't see how. Lets say they only have 2 customers, 1 full-fiat and 1 full-bitcoin. What happens in case of liquidation?
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:43:53

I'll try to help you understand what's wrong.
When you say "hijack the GPS receiver to connect it to blockstream", it makes my ears bleed. You are right in that a GPS-module is a receiver. So please explain what you mean when you say "connect", which is a word that implies an "action".
A receiver sits and receive. It can't "connect"... it can "tune to some frequency" and do various signal processing/decoding/filtering with what it receives.
When you say "hijack"... do you mean coerce it into doing something else than demodulating GPS signals? Like, a firmware update? Do you think GPS-receivers in phones are SDR, FPGA, or optimized asics? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:43:24
What is mind-melting is the suggestion that it can be done over the GPS network without providing some explanation... and without convincing readers that you have technical expertise to make such assumptions.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:14:03
yup, had OP suggested iridium data broadcast instead of GPS, I'd not bother commenting, because at least, it looks feasible ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:55:09
It is radio technology and in this application, it is broadcast radio, because you want to have global coverage. Radio spectrum can be shared... some slices of the spectrum are using "technologies" to do that. Have a look at TDMA for just one example. But you have to plan for that.
Want to use GPS receivers? Then you have to use the frequency that GPS are made to receive. It is pretty narrow. So you have to send on that frequency.
2 options:
- contract current operator and pay to have data broadcast through their stuff
- do it yourself (for any other frequency, I'd say you risk legal probems... but with that network operator, all bets are off)
There is hope though... but you'd need to research to make a more compelling hypothesis. There are other positioning networks... and maybe one of them actually planned and has the capacity to broadcast customer data along timing...

Can you exchange between fiat without fees? No.
So, should you increase the number of fiat exchanges (and so, fees) in order to increase your value? No.
Exception is if you want to trade your btc for some fiat on an exchange that isn't very liquid and so, where you wouldn't get a fair price on the exchange. If you are talking about "common" fiats, then just go straight to where you want to go...

You have to understand the risk.
The risk is to have your seed sent/uploaded to some scammer.
When you use a website, of course your machine is online, so the risk is very high and it looks like obvious fraud to enter your seed on a website. Even if everything appears to be done locally through some javascript. If you are able to audit the code and assess the risk, you wouldn't ask the question.
When you are downloading a tool, then disconnect your machine from network, then use this tool, the risk is still there, albeit slightly obscured. A malware could store your seed then upload it when you connect again to network.
Using such a tool on a live distribution may be ok, provided the malware isn't able to install some code on your main OS to store &amp; later upload your key.
It is complicated.
Why some users support the instruction? Maybe some are trying to scam you. Maybe some do not want to spend time explaining everything that can go wrong.
