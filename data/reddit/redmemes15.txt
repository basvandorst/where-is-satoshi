Growth percentages not returns in USD by year. Measurement is not based on the USD/BTC value per year but more in as in percentage growth like a treasury bond would perform. U.S. Treasury Bonds took small a hit yesterday against the USD, doesn't mean bonds are not a safe haven. Measurement in fiat is only part of the equation.

I don't feel like I painted the entire community. I painted the image of a "Jaded Vet" which we all can probably agree to being guilty of. Yes, there are avenues for newbs. No doubt. But that's not the subject here and especially since the inception of the heated block size debate, newb support is conflated with what side of the debate you are on, and to me, in my opinion, that's not fair to them.

At times, that's the case. There may be a few "please be nice" threads but not really that many. Alongside the multiple dumb questions often repeated, ignore it and it will go away, downvoted or forgotten. But some could use guidance and there are definitely nice people out there helping out. No doubt about that. But lately the "Jaded" attitude to me has gotten worse and this is just my humble opinion after all. So I felt like putting my 2 Satoshis out there. Appreciate the feedback. Cheers. :)

This needs to go viral. Let's knock these scammers out of the park. The so-called "Bitcoin Killer" is exposed for what they are a very large PONZI SCAM.

Because some beginners come to the most popular venues to get answers. And that's ok.

Thanks for reading my opinion piece. I felt like it needed to be said. Keep the debate robust but help people at the same time, treat new users with a little kindness and let's all bring bitcoin to the moon!

It's nice to hear they used the Bitcoin Blockchain as that technological signature. ;)
