Following. Im also curious, wondering if it will have a positive effect or not? guess well find out.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:13:00
No. I believe that is if you use your connected bank account. if you use credit/debit i believe its 3%, dont quote me on that though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:07:44
Shut up please
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:47:13

same to you! waiting to buy in again, been stuck on Coinbase.. finally verified on GDAX/Gemini
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:42:28
not really what im looking for.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:58:42
What? The value goes up or down no matter where you store them. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:19:30
Seems to be sitting at 11k for a while today, im a partial noob,  so does this mean anything good and or bad?
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:24:28
Mine said 3-5 days but I got it in less than an hour.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:53:33
That's what I'm tryna say! Saw this post earlier so I looked up his tweet..
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:40:14
so if im looking correctly (if you by chance are looking at GDAX rn too) theres like 500 buy orders at 12.4 k? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:01:08
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:35:10

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:46:34

@_date: 2017-12-16 18:42:56
In your ( or anyone opinion ) which alt coins do you think will succeed? just curious what everyone thinks!
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:06:50
i bought in at 9.3 and thought i was too late, now here we are. HODLing as well!
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:45:24
Working fine for me.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:08:29
I never asked how old you were, i asked if you were old enough to buy without your parents, which the more you type..the more i dont think you are, now hurry up, you might be late for class 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:39

@_date: 2017-12-06 14:28:50
lol, it will happen everytime you use coinbase if its connected to your debit/credit card. Every exchange has fees for purchasing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:21
Never? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:42:54
hit 19k for like 30 seconds, but i agree
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:14:57
I agree with what a few of the commenters say. This article is really only computing the time it takes to GENERATE a private key.
 
After ONE attempt to GENERATE a private key, you must (2)run the decryption program on the PUBLIC key you are trying to break, and (3) determine if you have broken it successfully (e.g. have a small subroutine that detects the TYPE of information that comes out to see if you have actually succeeded).
 
The TIME spent on the GENERATION of the private key to test (1 of 2^256 possibilities) is quick, compared to how long step (2) and step (3) would take to perform.
 
This is all just encryption/decryption of data just like Phillip Zimmerman created with PGP back in 1991. I read his book and I am a big fan of his. You should google him and just read a bit about him so you are familiar with him. He was viewed a bit like snowden is today. His PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) for encrypting emails to send back and forth between people was considered to be a WEAPON back then and was forbidden to be exported out of the USA even! Zimmerman got back at the government by putting it out on the Internet (which had no advertising on it at all back then and no browsers) for free. I had it. I probably still have it somewhere as an old version that is untraceable. After version 3.0, the government mandated a back door to get into the encryptions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:22:12
yeah, its at 16.9k on gdax right now. what the actual fuck
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:39:26

@_date: 2017-12-06 13:40:51
im not saying bitcoin is it, it was merely a question, it certainly COULD be, but it also could be what goes AGAINST the mark of the beast.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:38:03
Continue being a sheep.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:51:12

@_date: 2017-11-30 17:41:59
