If this decouples subscribers from their geographical region this could really open up dish subscriptions to regions they're technically excluded from.

The Bitcoin Decentral one on Spadina charged me around $60 to take out $240 CAD  a couple weeks back. I got $177 after fees.

Well I was thinking Proof of Death with distributed baseball bats but yours is better.

I wonder what gmaxwell would identify as the real top ten.

I went to my local bitcoin expo this summer, specifically to see if the folks really in this thing were anywhere near as full of shit as the people here. They were most definitely not. These forums are becoming like fringe groups of extremists, will be interesting to see how the industry distances itself from this element.

Well we'll need a DDOSCoin of course. Incentive to keep hammering the fuckers.

Excellent comment. These fucking morons are lost in their own echo chamber again.

Perfect, I'll watch it over my morning bale of hay.

Here in Canada there are shops/small businesses that do remittance to the Philippines. What would it take for a small business owner to set themselves up to use your services?

So glad we've got an exchange like QuadrigaCX in Canada. Fast, responsive site and a great team. If their site allowed for integrated transactions with rebit.ph, I suspect they'd corner the Philippino remittance market before Coinbase ever gets here. What do you say, you guys interested in working with Canadian exchanges at this time? I'd love to see (and help) this spread through our Toronto-Filino communities. Anyone else here from T.O. disagree/agree?
