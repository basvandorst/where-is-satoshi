I am actually doing this. I've cooked like 3 meals this morning to get rid of my anxiety. I didn't even go into work....

I feel like there's some good wisdom in this post but I'm having a hard time deciding it. Can you explain the 3rd paragraph (people selling...) again?

...I'm doing the exact same thing. I didn't even go into work today. 
My dog is happy at least because I just let him outside... if the ETF is approved he'll know to come home. If not, I hope he's smart enough to stay away.

I'm very curious as to the when and where as well. Up vote so maybe someone will see who knows! 
Great question.

Of course, you're right, in the long term. 
I'm going to be needing this money more short term, unfortunately. I am keeping my money in BTC and will be using it to travel in the near future.
But it will still rise over the next few months imo, so I went ahead and purchased with 2/3rds of my capital. We'll see what happens!
Thanks for assuming I'm not as dumb as I am.

Oh wait. I already did that
