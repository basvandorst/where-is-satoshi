Who knew stability would be bitcoin's kryptonite?

The IRS is only concerned when you convert bitcoin to and from fiat.  Moving bitcoin to a wallet is essentially the same as moving your money in and out of the bank - you don’t get taxed from the govt on that transaction.

Because they're paid by banks and companies that deal in fiat.  Bitcoin in the long term will reduce their influence if not make them obsolete if they don't adapt.  But they don't believe that right now - right now they're trying to use FUD to undermine an upcoming contender.

Technically they aren’t HODLers anymore.  I think that’s punishment enough.

If you think this is only going to affect BCH you're mistaken.  If the SEC is going to regulate exchanges, it's going to hit all crytpocurrency trading in the US.

This sounds like a YouTube video ad title.
@_date: 2019-08-12 04:06:11
I have.  Doesn’t change the fact that YouTubers take general investment advice and sensationalize it for their video titles.  If you got your note from Warren Buffet then give him the credit when you post.

Casual investors do this all the time.  I can’t tell you how many times I have to explain the concept of portfolio diversification to people just getting started and some are just told a general platitude (50/50 stocks/bonds) and they accept the advice with no questions asked.

You stay positive on understanding the long term benefits of btc and then dgaf about any day to day movements.

Uhhh it’s GINA thank you very much

If I learned anything from You Got Served, it’s that 50k is life changing - especially when you split it up with the other 5 guys in your dance crew.

In 2014 it would’ve been about 300-400 BTC depending on the month.

Holy crap lol - if this isn’t a sign of more mass adoption of the tech, I don’t know what is ��

No but this might be a situation that's better suited for teaching a man to fish rather than giving him the fish.  You probably don't want to be responsible for their money when the first dip happens under their watch... noobs tend to panic ;)
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:19:34
Because those kinds of friends buy on fomo and then fud out at the first major dip and then blame it on you :p

It’s a famous John F Kennedy quote regarding the US space program and why they were pushing to make it to the moon.  
“We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.”

5k sell wall - give it a little time...
@_date: 2019-01-05 03:14:07
That fee lol
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:37:47
Yes, 10k will be a huge barrier and the 1k barriers will be a thing until true FOMO kicks in.  Once that happens, people tend to buy in where they can and set stop limits in case a bad crash occurs.  Otherwise, people will ride the FOMO wave for as long as they can.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:08:28
It’s all moon memes after 10k
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:01:54
And is making sure it is being pushed past the normal sell walls...
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:55:28
Looks like a poke at the sell wall at 9k.  There are always automated limit sell orders set at certain psychological barriers (500 or 1k increments) and in order to push the price past them, the sell wall needs to be overcome with buys before people have a chance to react to turn the FUD into FOMO.
There will most likely be a few more large pokes in the next day or two and we'll see if the large volume orders are able to push past the wall.
