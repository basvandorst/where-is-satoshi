Specifically ScriptSigs with unnecessary NOPs.
A "non-standard" ScriptSig doesn't actually mean what people think it does.  It just means a ScriptSig that the GUI client doesn't yet know how to create (but does know how to validate).

But keep in mind that the shipping industry faced this problem with precious metals sent across the Atlantic for at least a few centuries.
Problematic, but manageable.

I think he's mixing up idioms here.
"Failure is not an option" is something an individual or small team says to motivate themselves.  Like "giving 110%".  Neither one is true, we all know it, you say it anyways.  Nobody takes it literally.
"Too big to fail" is some deranged brain damage you hear spouted by governments and politicians.  Unfortunately they *do* take it literally, and this is a big problem.

Isn't this Zhoutong's company?
Didn't people learn the first time they got scammed by him?

Agreed.  Robocoin is actually funded by the NSA.  It's a spying device.

Not enough funds on deposit at any point in time.
They only hold the coins until the transaction completes.  Exchanges hold coins backing the entire order book (at minimum).  Many exchange orders sit open for far longer than even the longest localbitcoins escrow.

That's **Mr.** Cox to you.
Or just Mt. Cox.

This is why AML/KYC is not "okay".

Of course not.  But nonprofits aren't businesses and your position is unreasonable to anybody who understands how prosecutors think -- and that includes the nonprofits' lawyers who advise them on these things.

Wait, you think that total lack of any jurisdiction to enforce liquidation preference is somehow a solution to Madoff and scamming?
My friend, I have some pirate bonds to sell ye.
Stock is only worth something because of court-enforcible liquidation standing, even if that's rarely exercised.  It's just like how COMEX futures are worth something only because they entail the right to take physical delivery, even if that's rarely exercised.  The fact that the right exists imparts value, and *only so long as people have faith in the effectiveness of that right* does it not need to be invoked.

Nope, every single bitcoin node validates these transactions.
Seriously, you are confusing [nonstandard blocks]( with [invalid blocks](  This confusion is commonplace, which is why the term "nonstandard" was a bad choice.

You're kidding, right?  This [has already been shown to not work](
