Yeah that is a bad situation with all of this stuff over the segwit stuff. People getting greedy fighting over fees. people need to realize that BTC needs to compete against the competition. End-users always have the choice on which crypto to buy. If you buy crypto from coinbase then you have a choice on what to buy. Development on BTC is increasing with LN but development is also occurring on the alt coin as well. BTC has first mover advantage but that won't be able to sustain it forever. At the end of the day BTC has to be able to get the job done for the best value to the end-user.....otherwise people will just decide to use other crypto. That's the reality.

stock market is booming right now dude lol but I also think overall economy is slowing. Too much debt.

If bitcoin has high transaction fees then most people would say that fiat money is superior, even with the inflation issue. That's why I say low transaction fees are beneficial overall. It brings more people into the network and encourage bitcoin to be used as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:11:08
The problem is too many people promote bitcoin basically as a way to "get rich"....see HODL meme and lambo meme. Which basically makes bitcoin look like it is an investment....which it is not. Bitcoin as originally designed was suppose to be something similar to cash where you just use it to buy/sell stuff. So now we have that big hurdle to overcome. If bitcoin is being more widely used as a medium of exchange then the true value will be seen and more people will use it. If it is just used a a speculation token then well we have big problems because there are now lots of cryptos which can do the same thing. Just look at coinbase. Back in the day you could only buy bitcoin but now you can buy a myriad of coins so if someone wants to speculate, they can just use any of those other cryptos as well.

Yup, true. LN for the paypal competitor.
@_date: 2019-05-06 06:11:52
Basically, whatever exchange you are using, is tracking it. If you are buying/selling within the exchange then they'll track the purchase price/sell price. If you are sending crypto to the exchange only to sell it then the exchange would only list the gross proceeds from the sale. You would have to track the purchase price and purchase date and the import that into your tax software. As far as how the IRS verifies that type of information (when your purchased it and for how much prior to cashing it out on the exchange) is probably impossible. I am thinking about situations where you simply mined the crypto. I think the IRS might use some sort of public ledger analysis software (created by a private company) to help them figure stuff out but IMO I think that type of analysis would be weak in a trial so the IRS would be more inclined to settle with you out of court if they don't have solid evidence of when you bought it and for how much.
EDIT: It is only taxable when you "sell" it for cash. There are people on here who like to get overly technical with everything and start to think about tax situations where you buy it on an exchange but instead of cashing it out, you spend it instead. As far as I know, I haven't heard anything about people getting in trouble with taxes for buying bitcoin and then spending it, even if they spend the cyrpto at a gain.

Yes of course. There is also open bazaar which is like a decentralized ebay. Completely free to use. I've bought a few items off there already and had no problems. Really boggles my mind that not many people use it.
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:39:18
It won't be death of money. Like all fiat currencies, when one falls, they just create a new one. Who knows how long people will keep their faith in it though but my guess is most people will be completely wiped repeatedly. Ignorance is a hard mental illness to treat.
@_date: 2019-05-09 05:53:46
yup exactly. It is amazing to look at other countries with hyperinflation (Venezuela) and see how people act. Crypto grew there a little but the vast majority were still using fiat that had went to shit. Litterally, people were buying stuff using sacks of money.
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:04:24
join us on it is like the ebay for buy/sell using crypto :) We need more people using it.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:23:55
No it wouldn't.  Millions or billions of people would be holding a certain amount of bitcoin in their "checking account" so to speak. These people would ultimately have to buy into the network to begin with. Price would definitely skyrocket.
Also bitcoin can be a store of value and a paypal competitor. It is not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:47:46
This is pretty much what it comes down to. A big part of gold is that it has the history behind it as it was once used as money. They're wrong in the sense that they believe that gold will be used as money in the future. Gold can be used as a banking reserve and the such but the problem is that trust relationship has been repeatedly violated over the decades. Even if the fiat is backed by x amount of gold, doesn't mean that will always be true in the future.
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:24:51
That's very common. For example, the IRS taxes "criminal proceeds" and doesn't let people deduct the cost of the stuff. So if you bought 5k worth of weed and sold it for 10k then you would have to pay tax on the 10k you sold it for. The only reason they do it like that is because it is easier to get people prosecuted for tax evasion than it is for drugs.
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:01:45
True, fair point, I see what you mean. I don't really see how it would work long-term because I certainly will be using the lighting network instead of the main net for most of my transactions.
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:58:08
It can already be used for that, of course. What people need to realize is that the holy grail is when people use bitcoin as almost like a checking account. You get paid, your employer deposits the bitcoin directly to your wallet address. From there, you can pay all your bills - utilities, cell phone, grocery shopping , online shopping etc. directly from that wallet. If people used bitcoin like this then the value of each individual bitcoin would probably skyrocket. Luckily we have lightning network so something like this is actually practical now. All it takes is people actually using it for that. People need to buy/sell using lightning network and the community here needs to support those merchants. It is win-win for everyone here. 
I hate when I read some comments on here where people limit their perspective to viewing bitcoin as an e-gold and then scoff at using it as a medium of exchange for daily buying.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:19:02
probably lol I think they outlawed crypto mining over there because the electricity was super cheap lol so you could basically mine crypto for basically nothing, assuming you could get the mining equipment setup.

Wrong. If you use amazon gift cards that are bought with stolen credit cards the codes get deactivated and the item doesn't ship. It only works if the original credit card owner doesn't report the unauthorized transaction. It does happen but not as often as you would think. If you are doing CC fraud, there are better ways to do it.
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:10:39
They report information to the IRS once you've went over certain thresholds. It is reported on a form called a 1099 or similar tax forms. If you look on paypal website it will say what their reporting requirements are.
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:53:33
Yes it can. Look up 51% attack. Very expensive to do though and probably won't work for long even with 51% gained because people would be alerted to the attempt prior to achieving the 51%.

smart man. Just focus on building wealth IMO.

Buffet has flopped on most of his tech investments anyways. When google, apple, amazon were smaller companies, buffet was betting big on IBM.....which has basically been a train wreck for the last 5 years. He simply does not understand emerging technologies at all because he looks at everything from the "cash flow potential" of the company which explains why he flocked to IBM instead of the others. The other three companies were creating something new and uncertain about its earning potential. It is only people who truly understand what those companies were doing that understood the value of the companies. Meanwhile, IBM has been in the computer business for decades so buffet saw that as value, not new emerging technologies. This is the same reason why buffet and similar types of investors don't see value in crypto. Most of them simply do not understand the value of the technology.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:37:20
Cool and they accept LN too :)
@_date: 2019-05-05 07:43:05
Seriousy lol I've been into bitcoin off and on for years. First got  into and I was stoked about bitcoin and it's potential. Back in the day, sending bitcoin on the main net was basically free but overtime the fees skyrocketed so I moved into other cryptos like bitcoin cash, litecoin etc. Recently, I tried the lighting network and was completely shocked by it. Complete game changer for crypto. Instant and virtually free to use! So now I am back into BTC for sure.
We need to start pushing this technology out there and start focusing on merchants to accept lightning network. I would totally pay for everything with BTC if I could!
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:19:15
IMO, most people are purely speculation. Even the hodling crowd is mostly speculation to a certain extent. So obvious when people are talking about lambo this and lambo that. They view it as get rich quick basically. I don't care if people do that but honestly if you want the price to go higher, it will have to be form real adoption occurring where people are using it as a medium of exchange.
I don't really buy into the whole deflation/inflation theory. So when there is deflation, you stop spending or reduce spending but what about when there is inflation? You suddenly rush to buy stuff? I think more realistic is people will spend the bitcoin then just go to some exchange to buy more.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:45:25
Problem is for using BTC directly the fee is too high, especially for small value transactions. I am looking at $1.50 USD with my wallet. We need a bigger push for making daily purchases with lightning network instead.
@_date: 2019-05-08 21:31:44
If you never told her you could have kept all the bitcoins to yourself lol

Word has it that facebook is making their own crypto of some sort. Details are light on it but from what I've heard, it is basically confirmed they have a "crypto payments" type project in the works.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:42:45
Pretty sure, yes.
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:14:14
Problem is bitcoin excessively high fees discourages it from using it as a medium of exchange. That's a big problem these days if you want the average joe to adopt it.
@_date: 2019-05-09 05:55:00
Central banks hold gold reserves which is suppose to give "faith" to the fiat, in theory at least.
@_date: 2019-05-06 07:36:10
Yup. There are two sides to tax. What the law says and how it is enforced through an audit. The laws are enforced through audits so you need to see how they handle crypto in audits. I can already tell you the auditor isn't going to give a shit about all the times when you bought a sandwich with crypto. They will focus on the situations where you sold crypto for cash (on an exchange) and also situations where you deposit cash into a bank account (they'll say that is unreported income).
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:18:37
BTC has a stronger community, larger community, more people using it, the history behind it etc. Whereas the other crypto are smaller and might have issues. Rather just use the lightning network.
@_date: 2019-05-13 08:05:11
Not sure if anyone mentioned it but you can go to local meetup groups and then buy/sell using physical cash in hand. I've bought all my BTC at spot price. Everyone is really nice and helpful. Never had any issues with doing it this way. Obviously don't go there with 28k in cash in a bag. Go with maybe 500-1k in cash to start then you can go with more once you build trust. Also use common sense with all your dealings.

Buy the BTC on a regular exchange (USD-&gt;BTC) then find a local person in China that wants to buy bitcoin with cash. You can try going to local meetup groups if they have them. That's how I've bought and sold my bitcoins in the past.

It really depends on the type of woman but IMO taking unnecessary risks is usually a stupid idea. The only people I hear say stuff like "honesty is the best policy" are usually poor people that don't have anything to lose to begin with but just imagine if you did have serious money. Let's say you had 1m worth of bitcoin (166 bitcoin)....you are best just keeping it a secret. If the marriage goes to shit then you just keep quiet and split the assets that are on the books. If she knows about it then you'll never hear the end of it during a divorce about how she is ENTITLED to half of it. Then you'll be ordered to give half based on court order...then you're officially fucked. 500k is an expensive price for honesty. Too much for me at least.
Also during the entire marriage she is probably going to be hounding you to just sell your "stupid bitcoins" to buy stuff etc. Why would you want to deal with that lol?
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:17:00
If you verified your account then it would be in your best interest to just pay the capital gains tax. If you want to risk it then you can decide not to pay the tax and then see what the IRS does. Worse case scenario you can always just say you didn't know about this requirement and then just pay the back taxes + interest + possible penalty when you get audited. No, they aren't going to throw you in jail for doing that.
The main thing you want to watch out for is if you get a tax form in the mail listing your transactions. If that is the case, then you 100% need to report it because the exchange sent all your tax information to the IRS with your crypto buy/sell activity.
Remember, you only pay tax when you sell your crypto based on whatever your gain is. You can also deduct $3,000 of losses per year if you don't make any money. Use tax software to calculate it.
@_date: 2019-05-06 05:01:53
The problem with doing that is if your coinbase gets hacked and someone clears out the account. Coinbase will not cover you if that happens. There is no insurance on bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:22:35
Yes, that's the theory but it doesn't really apply to bitcoin right now because bitcoin isn't really used as a medium of exchange. The inflation/deflation theory only really applies to currencies. Bitcoin is viewed more as a speculative investment instead, similar to a commodity.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:19:53
probably. If there is really some sort of crisis, the gold will just get sold and used for other purposes anyways so I don't really see how it could add any "faith" to the actual currency. All an illusion if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:19:24
When I say "sold for cash" I mean on an exchange. Not like literally meeting someone face to face and doing the deal in person. If you're selling crypto for physical cash in person, then yeah, that's pretty much off the radar unless you're blatantly running a money transmitter type service (advertising the service online).
@_date: 2019-05-06 06:29:05
Completely agree, I started using bitcoin years ago (Mtgox days) and back then using the main net was basically free since no one really used it extensively back then. Over time, I lost interest in BTC because the fees were skyrocketing. So I went to other cryptos instead. Now I hear about LN and how it can be used. I've seen youtube videos on people using it and I'm completely sold on it for sure. I don't really see how the other cryptos are viable with the exception of the privacy coins that bring some extra value to the table. In terms of what the majority of people will use going forward, I definitely see bitcoin + LN hands down. Plus it is really nice to see how much development has happened over the years. Lots of side projects going on and a decent amount of merchants using it.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:21:00
So do you view lightning network as a threat then? You can use lightning network and basically pay zero transaction fees. If more people used it then in theory mining fees on the main net would be reduced.
@_date: 2019-05-12 08:03:37
Back in the day I bought $50 worth of bitcoin on mtgox at around $10 each to test it out and see how it worked. At the time, I was toying with the idea of putting in another 5k but instead of doing it. I decided to ask around for advice on what other people though of it. I ended up asking for advice on and these people told me that bitcoin was a scam, basically. So I decided to never invest the money....Also for those wondering. Yes I pulled the bitcoin out of the exchange immediately after buying. I never had any money/BTC tied up with mtgox when it was having its issues. 
Moral of the story is if you think something is a good investment, especially if it is a non-traditional investment, then do your own due diligence and don't rely on other people's opinions. If you've ever been to the only thing these people recommend to invest in is index funds.
