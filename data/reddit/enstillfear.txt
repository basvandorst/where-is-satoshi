When you sell for USD. State the profit made. That's what your taxed on.

~~PUT IN YOUR BUY ORDER!~~

Nope. It's reddit gold.

Multibit has a pw protected wallet so you can only send by using a pw. Did you have this enabled or not?

Reading this scares me, I've opened a bitstamp account, and haven't used it yet.

My 1st bitcoin donation! :D Only $5.00 but hey - WA is my home state!
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:42:04
My cart wasn't working so I exited my browser cleared the cache and tried it again. It worked. Thankfully. 
Tips on things to buy if your having trouble like I did...
Cheap Headphones $20 - 30
Humidifier $25 - 47
LED Strip Lights $35
I also got a USB sound card and a air purifier. Awesome stuff. 
Coinbase transferred funds almost instantly.

Bitcoin will drop temporarily. Then rise rapidly in the next 6 months to beyond $800. 
I see it gaining volume and % 1000x what it is now.
@_date: 2014-04-02 10:57:20
Bitcoin will be worth more. I won't need to cash out with how many places take btc. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:08:02
I would love to spend my bitcoins, however I can't use a mobile app on my iPhone. The whole digital wallet / paper wallet thing scares me. Losing your piece of paper or having it damaged. Storing your bit coins in a wallet that could be hacked. 
Nobody is responsible for paying me back what is stolen.
Apple won't allow bitcoin transaction Apps (for unknown reasons). 
It's just hard to use now. Even on overstock if your connection is lost or an error occurs can't your bitcoin be lost forever?
I am a novice adapter and trying to learn - but the more I research the harder I find this process to use safely and easily. So no. It's not easier than cash - honestly will anything be easier than cash?

Bitcoin will be an international market for exchanging money from hundreds of currency's, quickly, easily, safely and affordable.

Not much you can do to hide when that many people want you to pay for your crime.
@_date: 2014-04-05 12:18:59
Not trying to be rude or speculative. But how do we know that our bitcoin wallets are safe inside your own programs 'apps'.
What's to stop you from stealing everyone's wallets?
Everyone is saying it's all amazing without checking it out first. Just curious.

This is exactly the problems bitcoin can and will solve.
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:04:45
I advertised that my photography business accepts bitcoins. No problem.
@_date: 2014-11-30 13:29:06
I hate it when people downvote just because they disagree. Good on you for giving!
Edit I'm not defending Rydan. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:52:02
Oh. So. True. ;)
@_date: 2014-04-02 09:07:51
But it's so much easier to just copy an address and transfer from my wallet on my PC. And .05 is nothing. Most banks charge more than BTC rates. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:43:57
Were you making a password required to send money? 
We need to find out how this happened. 
@_date: 2014-03-13 09:06:18
This was 5 days ago.
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:57:35
I should probably buy more? Who scoffs at the end of that video? Very rude.
@_date: 2014-11-17 09:02:16
I agree. Speed. Coinbase takes forever.
@_date: 2014-11-30 00:53:58
Great post, but I've never seen a post more deserving of a TLDR.

The PBOC Ordering the Closing of Bitcoin Trading Accounts in China?
@_date: 2014-03-13 11:58:22
No. Why would Facebook care about Bitcoins? I pay them with PayPal...
@_date: 2015-01-12 01:28:26
Sweet! I'll check it out. I'm a Portland photographer that accepts Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2015-01-12 04:06:17

PayPal charges more. Setting up a transfer is a lot more difficult and requires fees.

What curves are you looking at that shows higher by 2030?!?! Been in this since 2014 I highly doubt these claims of 100K +++++
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:35:49
WW3 won't be fought like previous wars. BTC if anything would grow due to currencies not holding their value. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:52:25
�� you assume we bought in 2017. 2014 here. I'm just happy it's above 1000
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:42:00
The fact that you have 4x the upvotes for this comment reply means a lot. I'm a firm believer in BTC but no way it hits those levels in 2020
@_date: 2018-04-15 05:51:23
I honestly don't know if I should upvote or downvote. FML. Should've sold at 19,500.
