Hi I am having an issue with my transaction from the mycelium app to my ledger nano s. I sent the transaction with a fee that is about 0.05 cents, I am not sure about how to deal with this because it has been a week since I sent the transaction. Please I need some help, I feel like it is stuck in the network and i cant get it back. the app keeps telling it is still sending it to the ledger nano s. I check the hash number but it keeps telling me that the transaction is nowhere to be found.

@_date: 2016-12-23 03:54:15
but they are getting bitcoins by mining which are the new bitcoins being mined. What if we reach the 21 million mark and there are no more to be mined? How will they get their "fees"

from what I read on some articles it should be more then 8 connections. if it is only 8 connections your port is not open. but that is not the case for me I know my port is open so it should not be happening.
