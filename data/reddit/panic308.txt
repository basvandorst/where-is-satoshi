No shit.

I'll never understand how she didn't die.

They need to list LTC asap.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:49:00
I SO heard that too.  Anyone in the US who keeps Bitcoin is like, really dumb.  Sell!
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:24:06
Awesome, much appreciated

I've worked private security in fuckistan, and seen some shit, but that was the single most intense and FUBAR thing I've ever seen.  Unreal.

For what it's worth, I've wired very large amounts to Gemini on 5 separate occasions now without any issues.  My account is usually credited in about two hours.  I'm happy with them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:21:46
Probably tomorrow afternoon, at this rate.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:41:31
You glorious bastard
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:41:32
That's an ignorant thing to say
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:26:22
Impressive communication.  Well done!
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:32:28
I've sold 1-5 BTC amounts a couple times on Gemini, but usually just waited on the market and bought it back soon.  I've never wired out of Gemini, so can't really speak to that.

I saw something in the charts at 7300 that I was SURE was going to signal another spike and I blew my load for 7 more BTC.  I'm an idiot.  I'm just going to hodl and pretend this never happened.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:43:58
That's going right in my Crypto bookmarks
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:01:29
Sweet, thanks

Atomic transfers will link BTC and LTC at a 1:4 ratio, that # is based on total available tokens for each currency.  When this happens, BTC will take a bit of a hit, but LTC will stabilize at 1/4 of the BTC price.
My opinion, but I think it makes sense.  
Tldr, buy LTC.

Or duckduckgo search engine, or Brave browser.  DDG doesn't list ads at the top of it's results, so it's safe to click on the first link.
Google and Chrome have become what they were created to combat; a bloated and exploitable browser.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:50:52
No wonder they can't be bothered to help my weeks old support request.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:29:18
Not for a couple years, so that's a great idea to watch it tonight.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:11:12
Not on Gemini
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:34:02
My elementary school age kids each have 1btc sitting in a paper wallet, I'm going to surprise them at graduation.  Hope I did the right thing!
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:14:02
If you're talking about an ACH payment, probably the standard 5-7 business days.  Wire is much quicker, but who sells BTC for $$ !?! :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:22:32
Perfect response
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:48:15
10 @ $13.41/ea :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:28:01
Not dumb.  He's using 5 BTC as an example.  It's a 1:1 split, so .0456 BTC will net you .0456 B2X.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:31:13
The mental math is super easy today!
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:42:22
Take his dog as a hostage, make him live up to his word.  I'm JK you never fuck with a man's dog.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:47:36
That doesn't help anything.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:17:41
Kinda off topic, but did you see how they have added technical analysis to some coins?  I absolutely love that!
@_date: 2018-11-10 13:26:14
Was going to say ever same thing.  How this moron still has a job is beyond me.  Then I remember he works for the NYT with other playdough eating rejects.
