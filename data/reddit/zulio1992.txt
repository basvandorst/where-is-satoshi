I'm not familiar with cash app but remember not your keys not your coins.
@_date: 2019-07-09 13:52:55
Wait till next halvening it might drop back under 10k eventually
@_date: 2019-07-30 09:25:48
Good mindset and welcome to the fucking show. Good time to step in!
@_date: 2019-07-30 08:57:47
If youre 0.01 is worth 100 now and btc reaches 100k its worth 1000 easy as that.

Don't tell me what to do?
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:23:08
Every 2 weeks or month for less fees

Wait a few days imo. A little correction will be coming to under10k then dollar cost average in

Do you know how hard it is to buy.. the last bull run you had to wait months to get an active account on coinbase etc... much people heard about bitcoin but nobody tried to understand it. When more people learn what bitcoin is about more people will get into it... this is just the beginning. We need to simplify the buying and holding process and then more people will buy imo.

And greed, thats why people will change their minds. Human greed is beautifull
@_date: 2019-04-04 08:11:36
Why didnt you just start buying in dec and dollar cost average until now... 
@_date: 2019-04-11 10:24:42
But if you gave me your keys i can move you bitcoin even though they are yours.. you could just give people 100 btc and pay no taxes
@_date: 2019-04-11 13:08:52
Yeah but you shouldn't be able to give people money like that you cannot gift people millions there would be way to much fraud like that.

You know that all exchanges got waiting lists for people to subscribe? The masses haven't bought yet. There were alot of new people trying to come in but were not able to get in so they might want to come in the next bullrun when exchanges and bitcoin is ready for them :) have patience. Time will tell
@_date: 2018-11-27 07:34:58
For the future :)

@_date: 2019-05-25 07:10:47
Yes invest, but only what you can afford to lose. And don't sell until dec 2021 id say. And in the meantime learn more about bitcoin. Goodluck
@_date: 2019-05-22 10:49:25
Dollar cost average

@_date: 2019-05-14 14:50:49
