Why is noone talking about btc ul and its counterpart that might  be doomsday for btc if something goes wrong... and its not too far away so yeah thats the worst thing thst could happen i would guess

No its just a rule any bullrun ends and corrects no matter what.
Only thing to speculate on is when might be at 10k per btc noone knows that but it will ene and correct someday :D
@_date: 2016-12-16 07:58:55
why not poloniex or kraken? :)
@_date: 2016-12-02 17:58:18

@_date: 2016-12-12 17:33:20
i would like 1k till summer 2017
and i would spend it all on recording my own porn flick with 3 girls :)
@_date: 2016-12-25 21:22:52
never buy during a bullrun even if it lasts weeks things always go downhill after things were up high
@_date: 2016-11-05 19:01:43
watch out for robbers if its alot of btc.
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:54:19
For anyone thinking its not, well you are wrong.
However it could take maybe up to feb, but there is going to be a correction maybe to  700 then we could climb up again.
Or the unlikely we climb till 2k like some think :D

Good read, its kind of true a nice example of that is:
Can your parents use bitcoin?
 If no its not easy and can never replace cash.
Because i bet your parents can or even have atlast once used paypal without problems.

Dont post my name pls.
@_date: 2016-12-16 08:05:51
But the real question is can we reach 800€?
Because thats even better :D
@_date: 2016-12-19 07:57:48
Kimdotcom said it would hit 2k in 2017 so im kind of optimistic.
His bitshare service with micropayments should if working be HUGE!
Really awesome realworld use!
And lets not forget that his last project was huge!
