All you can do is wait. That's a good thing though, as the market is down and will most likely shoot up by the time you get your coins in 8 days

Don't worry. We all were. A lot of us were playing around with it like it was never going to be worth anything. Even more got the hell out when it hit 500, another group at 1000, another at 3000, another at 10000. Everyone has made mistakes. Think of how many people were lamenting that they had lost 700k back when it hit 1000 per coin. All the stories of people digging landfills for their old laptops. Do you think they would have held if they found it? Probly not. Very few have actually weathered the storm.

I'm in enough that I have a tiny amount of bitcoin in from forever ago that I'm probably just going to let sit. If I lose it I lose it. It was a fun ride anyway and it cost almost nothing back then. 
I did grab 100$/100$ etherium and litecoin though just to see what happens.

If you are freaking out, this might not be for you. 
But bitcoin swings wildly after a large rise. It always recovers. 
Or it could be the first time it doesn't recover and you are screwed. 
Welcome to bitcoin.

It still amazes me how much people cling to TA with Crypto. I've seen so many predictions based on charts in the reddit chat that fall flat. No one knows what the hell is going on 90% of the time. If they did, they wouldn't be bothering with a reddit chatroom. They'd be long gone with millions in the bank.

The difference being, the US doesn't give a fraction of a shit about debt. Who's going to force them to pay it?

Why are you buying with a credit card? Just use bank acct. Especially if you aren't transferring to alts anytime soon (which im assuming you aren't since you are dicking around for a credit card to arrive)
