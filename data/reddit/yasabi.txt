Privacy must be on the base-layer or it's next to useless.

What you're describing is an offchain mixer.  It's a bandaid for an otherwise totally transparent ledger.

Hell of a goalpoast moving there.

Transactions cannot be settled on the lightning layer, they have channels opened and closed on the base layer for both the buyer and the seller.  Moving between the two layers also leaks other metadata that can compromise privacy and correlate users.  Protocols must be designed from the ground up with privacy as the default, it cannot be added on after-the-fact and opt-in.

That's absurd, there are numerous ways to study prehistoric humanity, including archaeology, geology, and anthropology - the latter of which also frequently writes about nomadic hunter-forager groups that still exist.
Also there are many present-day instances of areas that have formal states but informally little to no rule by said states due to geographic and political restrictions, such as central Siberia and the southeast Asian massif.

You can't have a fair enough initial distribution to incentivize mass usage as a currency with Bitcoin's Austrian-inspired hyperdeflation.  Every coin that has attempted this has seen the same issue: a few thousand people wind up hoarding the majority of coins for little cost due to the timing of their entry in the market and thus have massive incentive (vs fiat gains) to manipulate the market.
Bitcoin has gone the way of the bankers it alleged to supplant. Anyone who actually wants a non-state currency, that is viable as a currency and not a speculative vehicle, should look into [Grin]( instead.

The first amendment applies to the state, not private entities.  If you don't like Coinbase then don't use them.
