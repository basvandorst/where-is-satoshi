US markets not even open
@_date: 2018-05-15 16:59:25
Thanks, will take a look
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:01:56
Damn, I was hoping I would be able to claim some money, but it appears I had nothing in my MtGox wallet at the time... 
@_date: 2018-05-16 07:07:25
I just checked on Amazon and seen it's 640 pages... ouch. Do you think it's worth having a look at and is it still relevant in today's market (especially crypto, and longer term - etfs)? 
Also had a quick read about the analogy of Mr Market - I like this concept and definitely makes sense when it comes to crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-15 12:06:18
Yeah, it's OK but quite repetitive and delivered in a krass manner. Still helped me get into investing and gave me a base understanding of how to make money work for you.

Speak to your dissertation tutor about your idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 11:34:21
When can I get my account and card then? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 14:58:17
Nope. Many small transactions failed too. My transaction is less than 1 BTC and didn't send or get returned yet. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:57:23
What's the protocol now for coins that are showing up as double spent? Do we wait, or contact MtGox? 
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:55:16
My transaction of 0.1 BTC is doublespent. Is this just a matter of waiting now, or is it lost money and I need to contact MtGox? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:01:41


Is it out yet? 1 hour isn't that long for MtGox, they tend to take a while to process, even before any issues started.
@_date: 2014-02-04 12:10:27
Coin withdrawn 2014/02/01, as of 2014/02/04 1pm, still no refund.
Once I have the coin out of my wallet, I will no longer use Mt Gox.

So this is where blockchain is interesting and also probably one of the main ways that blockchain and cryptocurrencies in general are misunderstood by you and the public. 
Simply put, cryptocurrencies enable something called "digital scarcity", this is imo *the number one* killer app of blockchain. This means my bitcoin is different to and distinguishable from your bitcoin and can never be copied or be made to look the same as yours. I.e. it is not replicable.
We're not used to that, because when we download a file from the internet, we're downloading a copy. 
Even when we buy credit like an iTunes voucher, it's data stored on a centralised database somewhere that is not unique, your $15 iTunes credit is no different to mine other than where the number is stored on the database. 
So when we talk about rarity, we're actually talking about scarcity, and importantly we're talking about the fact that blockchain enables us to view each individual unit of a cryptocurrency as separate pieces that cannot be copied and are unique to each other.
I would definitely read up on this, and the "blockchain" ledger. It really seems clear from this thread that people don't understand cryptocurrencies, the distributed ledger and how it enables digital scarcity. Something that was not possible until the invention of bitcoin. 
Check out this article for starters.

This is good information. When Hasbro release a cryptocurrency themed monopoly game, we will have the true reached market peak
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:16:46
This is very true of course
@_date: 2017-11-24 10:42:03
Hmm.. it's a an actively managed Bitcoin certificate. Which is different to owning the bitcoin. So OP made a mistake in the title of this article, but it's still interesting and overall a win for Bitcoin.

That is why one of the most popular gold ETFs is the one ran by the ZKB, which is one of only a handful of banks with a AAA credit rating. It's pretty much safer store of value than having it yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:37:07
He can't because this is a banking app where you buy BTC through bitstamp and can never actually claim them yourself.

Obviously just the nickname of Nouriel Roubini

Woah woah woah I think you're confusing the majestic tulip with the lame-ass daffodil.
@_date: 2018-11-29 13:35:46
Be careful, because you don't actually own them. They're held at BitStamp.

It looks like one of those bone shaped hide snacks that's been chewed up on one end.

It's not a scam... Swissquote are a well-known bank operating in a far more regulated sector than any exchange.
Though I still agree with the statement "not your keys, not your coins"... that said, it's still not a scam, they do make the buyer very aware of this and have them agree to a contract before you can buy crypto currency on this platform. 
It's mainly aimed at retail investors who want crypto exposure without the "hassle" of going through an exchange.

OP is such an idiot. Classic case of writing something he hopes will happen as if it's going to happen. Probably better to pray for the price to go up than to write shitty posts like this.

I know people are worried because of a 5% drop, but the single most bullish signal (50EMA crossover of the 200 EMA line) happened yesterday evening on the 4h chart. This is really the only signal that comes before every bull run.... Maybe I'm naive, but why would it be wrong this time? It's a normal dip after 2 weeks of a bull run...
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:01:09
Fair question - well I'm no expert either but my understanding is that if the time interval is larger, the signal is stronger. Sure the 4h is arbitrary but no more arbitrary than a 24h interval when trading is 24/7, but if you go back in history it has typically been a strong bullish signal on the 4h chart lasting usually several months. On the 1 day chart the 50MA hasn't been below the 200MA for years I think.
It would therefore surprise me if we cross over again so soon. Although anything is possible in this market. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:25:27
why? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:36:08
Would be interesting to see the movement of the coins on the blockchain. If there's no proof, why believe it at all?
