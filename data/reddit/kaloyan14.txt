Няма да се изненадам, ако нашите са участвали. Не бях чувал за този скам преди, нито пък за българското участие в него. Странно, при нас не е имало никакви последици.

I like Bitcoin because of its comfortability, becauae of the way that you can send money without a third part, without regulations and whereever you want. Butcoin is the future of the payment system
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:11:13
I didn't miss the fun, but I'm just curious to see what the more experinced users think about the future price.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:50:33
Hey, I was just asking, you butthurt bitch.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:30:25
Yeah, maybe it'll be too late, if I wait for a real dip.
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:34:18
Why is your government prohibiting it? Even the Bulgarian one hasn't done it!
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:15:01
Reminds me of r/dogecoin
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:06:42
Macedonia is a disgrace...
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:58:22
I'm trying to do it. You must understand, that I live in a country, where Bitcoin and the whole idea for the cryptocurrencies are too unpopular.
@_date: 2017-08-17 07:44:22
I'm planning to buy some Bitcoin right today and I think I'll be just like that in a few days.
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:07:40
Me too, but when Bitcoin splitted into Bitcoin and Bcash, the price of the original Bitcoin kept rising.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:45:36
I will see and I want a video from that. :-)
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:19:53
I'd never panic sell, though.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:18:23
True, but in these so called ATM's you paid massive miner fees and that's Bitcoin, I think, not the ATM. The most part of the fee I paid was the miner fee. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:50:10
Actually that sounds very well. Hope it becomes a reality.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:01:45
I hope so.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:52:52
Yeah, that makes me jealous the most, but the luck too, because I'm just operated from luck. Whatever I do and however I try, there is ever a guy with just a luck, qho receives everything and I jusy watch
That's it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:06:14
Yes, I'm translating it from my language - Bulgarian
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:16:05
Maybe you're right, I'm a noob here and for the time that I made a research about Bitcoin, the price got only higher and higher. I have known for the periods of down swings, but I just haven't seen one. When I started to research until I bought, the price was only getting higher. Although you can be sure that I learned a lot about the Bitcoin past.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:37:41
I hate such a luckers like this.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:01:06
Real human being here, you can be sure. I'm a newcomer and I need the money, please!
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:31:32
I already checked them a while ago.
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:15:28
This is only the beginning and I hope I'll have inspiration to make the works better and better.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:44:03
How can I laugh to the bank from the grave?
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:06:27
Yeah, maybe. On the one hand, there is me, that will buy Bitcoin in a recordly high price and see how it drops, when I have already bought and on the other hand is that a guy just receives around 700$ without even knowing from who. How not to be jealous?
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:27:18
Exactly, it changes constantly.
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:38:02
I don't know if you say it ironically, but thank you anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:16:39
I'm 14 too and I'm preparing to get my first Bitcoins too. I know what he feels.
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:10:52
I'm using Electrum and I think it's good. Easy to use, not too slow and and good interface.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:32:11
You're so rightful about the fees.
Man, I just bought Butcoins for about 30.90 BGN and the fee was about 7 BGN. How are we supposed to buy with such fees? If I want to buy BTC for 2 BGN, I will receive almost nothing because of the fees. I'm a newcomer and this situation is very confusing for me.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:30:32
Thanks, my friend told me the same thing about the buying and hodling. I will keep my coins and buy more.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:37:17
All the 0.00$ I have made.
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:07:04
Thanks, bro, the support of the more experienced with the cryptocurrencies means a lot for me.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:08:04
Stupid joke, indeed. These guys started to return the old Russian power and now everyone shitting on them.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:35:22
I'm trying to do that too, although I don't have any Bitcoins in my wallet yet. Just go to a place with a slow internet connection no more than 3G(H+) and you'll see that you'll stop checking the price 200 times a day.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:01:32
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:33:06
If I only could get these BTCs now...
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:53:34
I buy Bitcoin on a Cash - Terminal, so I paid that fee to the exchange, though...
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:43:00
Don't panic sell when the price starts to fall miserably. Try to not worry. That were the advices the community here gave me, when I bought. Be patient. Learn more and more. Invest constantly and when you see a dip - buy as fast as you can, if the dip is still here, of course. And enjoy the world of the cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:07:02
I hope so!
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:23:14
I suggest "Bitcoin Ticker Widget". It may be a little slow, but I personally like it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:54:32
Korean money, Jihan Wu maybe
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:52:24
I will see it, as I said, I'm a noob, so I never heard of this currency.
@_date: 2017-08-23 09:07:21
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:16:09
I'd give this guy some BTCs for the idea, if I could afford it. Send him some! :-)
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:32:50
I'm here only to tell you I'm here. :-)
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:30:19
I hope so.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:46:55
Bro, I have posted in r/btc three or four times max. Do you really call that "aggressively" and "quite often"?
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:51:55
I want it
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:47:39
Russian government is trying to regulate the oligarchs and the mafia, because nobody can stop it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:20:44
So I'm the first, for the sake of blockchain!:-)

Any suggestions, no definited topic. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:18:12
Not too much, I'm new, I just share expressions. I have heard many bad answers to the Coinbase's functionality, but only that. I think u/Kalin101 knows much more about the other wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:41:33
I want it!!!
@_date: 2017-08-23 01:55:09
However I'll HODL and see.
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:21:41
@_date: 2019-06-30 00:29:03
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-04-25 06:18:52
I downvoted you too, for the sake of it.
@_date: 2019-04-30 14:28:46
Yeah, but writing correctly is still very important. And no, I'm not a native speaker.
@_date: 2018-11-04 14:12:26
Misleading headline. You can buy literally everything and everyone with enough money in Bulgaria. It's not something good.
@_date: 2018-03-02 23:05:15
Wholesömige deutsche Memes.
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:16:15
Most of the allegations weren't even proven. Also, the people who DID the crime, will stay in prison for no more than 10 years, while Ross has 2 LIFE SENTENCES + 40 YEARS WITHOUT PAROLE. How is that fair?
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:22:52
@_date: 2019-01-03 15:40:26
I don't have any profit from that. I'm just doing what I think is right. Ross must be set free from prison immediately and I wouldn't benefit from it in any way, except that I'd feel slightly better about the law system in the USA. I still don't see what is your problem here.
@_date: 2019-01-03 11:18:36
Are you a troll, or just insane?
@_date: 2019-01-03 02:24:31

How did Coinbase fuck up the bitcoin's price the last time you remember?
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:32:34
What do you mean with that?
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:43:33
Why are you trolling/spreading rubbish then?
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:52:15
Firstly, I don't think I'm wasting my time trying to do my small part in this big and important campaign. I'm surely not a big contributor, but it's still better than doing nothing. Second, thanks. I'd text you if I meet such a girl, we can become good friends, although I'm not a libertarian (and I haven't said that I am anywhere). I'm sure it can work well for me in lots of ways and I will try to make them true. Wish you all the best from this and the upcoming years!
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:09:29
See in the trash bin.
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:29:36
No, it showed just 0.00 mBTC until the first confirmation. But now it's alright.
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:52:14
Well, they just explored America with this announce...
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:58:03
See it hardly, because it's not easy to find anything on the moon from here...
@_date: 2018-02-19 22:06:47
@_date: 2017-09-11 09:33:57
Yes, but the transaction is already visible for me in the wallet. Just a bug that I can't see the money until the transaction is confirmed.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:08:23
It's never too late to invest in Bitcoin, just remember it. If you think your financial status isn't in danger and you are sure that you learned enough for this type of things, then you're ready.

I need it as fast as possible.
@_date: 2018-12-14 15:58:53
This bet is stupid. The guy said that himself. That's why he apologized. I don't know you, but I myself hate people who claim how honorable, innocent and fair they are. This is an absolutely neglectable bet, made unofficially in the Internet between a minor and some random guy. Why is that so serious? And why would you be pleased when someone deletes their account? How is that fixing anything? If some folk with 3-months account told me to delete my own, I'd laugh at his pathetic imaginary anonymous face.
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:10:11
It really is, but I think OP wanted to show that he isn't a scammer or anything like that, just a regular internet folk who has to learn a lot of things here yet.
Cheers to you too!
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:20:23
He is a reddit user, not a fucking bank. Also, he already apologised and said that he can't pay that much money, so further discussions are not required.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:54:33
Suddenly so many "psychologists" appeared to judge the whole psyche, "hidden" behind the stupid bet these two made. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:38:39
No, your behavior gave it away. It also leads me to the conclusion that you have other itchy parts, probably your dignity.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:18:27
...and we know full well that u/WhateverIslamicThingItWas wouldn't pay either, so why bother to even discuss that? The aforementioned user wants to receive these money too, but wouldn't send them. I don't think anyone must take these meaningless internet bets seriously.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:38:54
...and suddenly u/Kalin101 started to have several mental disabilities without anyone, including him, knowing. We are honored to have such a talented psychologist around here, one who can create a whole personality and then call it a sociopath. I don't know what disappoints me more - your comment or the fact that there were people whose brain is so damaged that they upvote your comment.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:10:57
I don't know why they made the bet, I wouldn't do that. However, I think it's fine, having in mind that u/Kalin101 confessed that he made a stupid decision and didn't hide in a rabbit's hole. Instead of that, he apologised publicly and now is defending himself against all of the intrigue - thirsty halfwits that insult him in various ways. It's not possible for a thinking individual to not take his side.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:44:54
It's not affordable for him to pay up, according to himself. That's why he apologised. Why do you care so much if he will honor the stupid bet or not?
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:49:52
Do you really expect that the other guy would really pay if they lost? Also, I'm absolutely sure that you wouldn't pay it up either, but you can freely be a "honorable man" anonimously on the internet. I hate such liars.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:51:08
You didn't realize YOU'RE(you continue to be illiterate, which is hilarious) the biggest piece if shit around here. I may not want to pay a tremendous amount of money over an unserious bet made in the internet (how bad am I!!!), but not only you wanted to insult me for my morals(you can't even know how much I know about this IRL), but you also showed your own morals, which, if average, make the human future very disappointing. I'll explain why for a second or third time: you started speaking about fucking my mother (and you thought I'm a 12 years old, which makes your statement even worse) and continued to talk about that even when I exposed you for that. The amount of impudence here is unreal. I pretty much stand on the side I've taken and that makes me a Nazi? If you only knew how much I know about fascism and national - socialism and how much I hate it because of that... But anyway, calling someone a loser in the internet, when you don't know them makes you even more stupid, although at this point it's hardly possible for you to become more laughable and pathetic. Last, the end of your reply pretty much sums the peak of your intelligence, which would be found very sad by every thinking person on this sub.
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:49:59
If I haven't missed anything, he hasn't said that he doesn't have the money. Again, I don't believe you would lose $3k over some stupid bet done in a forum. Showing yourself as honorable, when you are nothing more than anyone here isn't working fine to prove your high morals. Do you have any valid reason for him to delete his account, or you just want to see someone being discredited in any way? Also, he admitted he was stupid, what do you want more?
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:22:38
I'm blown up by the unbelievable intelligence your reply shows our neglectable souls. How are we blessed to have such diamonds of the human race like you in our community?
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:59:23
"Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words."
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:06:07
If you made such a stupid bet for $2000 and you have $1999, does it mean that you can absolutely afford paying the money?
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:47:03
He is choosing not to because he can't afford paying it. $3k are too much, aren't they? I wouldn't make such a stupid bet, but even if I did, I wouldn't pay it either. Also, the other posters found out that he is a minor. How can a minor afford to give up $3k for nothing? Also, that is not a loan. He hasn't taken any money from u/IslamicThingIDontRemember.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:21:25
I was being nasty? I asked you why do you want for anyone to pay, how does that help you and firstly you bragged about your "morals", then you started to speak about other people's mother. With your whole impudence, you're continuing to make such statements. What is wrong with you? And why did you call the women you marry for "bitches"? Go tell them that. At the beginning I was disappointed from you, without even mentioning your illiteracy in your own language, while it's not my native, but I still write in it far better than you, but now I'm genuinely outraged by your whole existence. Don't call that an insult, I just tell you the truth. Your only answer to every insult is "i fuck ya mom", which shows your "true intellectual superiority" against or anyone here.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:52:04
Like your parents have left a pathetic fuck like you
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:19:23
You tell me about your "high morals" and 2-3 replies after that you talk about fucking anyone's mother. Who is the clinical case here? Not only YOU'RE illiterate, but you're also a walking meme. I don't give a damn about anyone's scams in this toxic thread, full of newborn accounts of people who are here just for the speculations. Why are you still talking about the worm you call a dick? Do you have any complexes, whose reason can be found in an inability to perform a sexual intercourse? I don't want to know about your mental problems, it's not my job. If I must be more gentle to such a sad creature like you, I'd advice you to just go away. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 21:37:44
That's why I don't make such bets, dumb ass rubber. Where did he sign to pay any money anyone? And what would deleting his reddit account change? Maybe it will just make bloodthirsty fucks like you very happy, because someone has lost something. According to your way of thinking, my morals are 1000% lighter than yours, you just proved it yourself.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:28:41
Do you have some disability? Didn't you read that he can't afford to pay that amount of money and that he apologises for that. Isn't that enough for you all intrigue - thirsty fucks?
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:00:07
I assume you are experienced with that.
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:02:49
Where did I say that I justify his actions? I think the bet is stupid and I wouldn't make such a thing, but he apologised and I appreciate that. If he deletes his account, he'd be a liar, but he confessed everything publicly. Don't forget that he's a MINOR. Haven't you made mistakes when you were a teen, or you were always so perfect that you can judge fully unknown people for you, to define their personality and even to think of yourself like something more than me, u/Kalin101, or anyone else. How the fuck do you have the right to say that I'm a "liar" or a "cheat"? What even are you to give such asseses? And who are you to say who must be taken out of the "ecosystem", while pathetic toxic sludges like you continue to exist. Just with that last absatz you wrote you're falling lower than the fucking worms in my eyes.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:04:14
Firstly, it's so ironic for you to speak to me about morals, when you are a little ammoral prick and you've proven it. Secondly, I'm not 12 years old, and for the final, people like you, who make statements about dicking another people's mothers certainly don't have the attributes to do so. That was so sad and cringy from you that I would laugh, if you weren't such a miserable soul. Imagine that I really was 12 years old, then you would have been insulted by a child. How is that feeling? Just go to YOUR(not you're) pathetic life and find comfort by cleaning the spider webs in your mom's basement, you 30-years old sick intrigue - thirsty fuck. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:14:37
Average people at least know the difference between "your" and "you're". Seemingly, you aren't even average, you are just some pathetic little bloodthirsty scum. Now go to the hole you crawled out of.
@_date: 2018-12-12 15:34:48
Blessed are the believers. Don't you think for a moment that you maybe aren't a prophet and can't know his whole life? Are you sure you can define how he lives his lifetime just by some stupid unreal bet, which both sides weren't ready to pay? Last: why the fuck is it important to you how much money he has? I hate people like you so much. It's not your job to supervise others' funds.
