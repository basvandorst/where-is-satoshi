Too many unnecessary steps man
Just buy bitcoin when you can and hold it, you will lose more often than not when trying to short this market
Stack sats and keep them in a safe place, see where you get in 5 years

Be careful what you read, especially on reddit and social media. You will see constant talk of bitcoin headed to the moon and see pictures of Lamborghini’s. Maybe eventually, but you will only be disappointed in the near term if these become your expectations.
Take it slow, learn about it, and buy a little bit every week. Patience is virtue.
Oh, and HODL

Very informative post. Any reasoning behind your prediction? Just feeling good?

Why’s this getting down voted? This pump is in no way indicative of an imminent bull run. It makes bearish scenarios less likely yes, but we’re not in the clear. Support broke at 9450.. next major support is $8800. If that fails we’re back at the $8300 support level. I want a bull run like anyone else but false optimism and greedy speculations aren’t helping anyone

Thanks, corrected mistake

Good point. My comment was more directed at the general sense of over-optimism I’ve seen on this forum, constant lambos and moon posts. Its headed down. My intention was to add substance backing his comment, not to give him a massive upvote

No worries it’s about to dump, give a day or 2 - hopefully your funds arrive by then!
