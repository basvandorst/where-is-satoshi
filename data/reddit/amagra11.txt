I apologize if I offended you.  I suppose I should have expected someone to be offended--I did, after all, ask for comments.  I shouldn't take offense myself just because you disagree with me.  
Perhaps I do need to work on the terminology before I attempt to make an argument.  I will be taking the post down now.

Hmmm...you say I need to look at the tables for our debt-to-GDP ratio.  Wikipedia defines GDP as "Gross domestic product is the market value of all officially recognized final goods and services produced within a country in a year."  GDP is how much money the country has, not how much the government has.  If I were talking about how much all private citizens owe in debt, it would make sense to compare it to GDP.  But since my article discusses government debt, not private citizen debt, shouldn't I be looking at tables that compare the government debt to its taxation income, instead of comparing it to the GDP of the country?
Also, you seem to think U.S. government debt is a good investment.  Tell me then, if the amount the government owes keeps growing, when, if ever, will they be paying the money back?  And how?

All right then, enlighten me.  Why is it so common to measure the health of a government's debt levels by seeing whether that country's CITIZENS could pay back that debt if they all emptied their pockets?
Also, you said, and I quote, "Do you know how desirable US debt is?"  I thought when you said it was "desirable" you meant that you thought it was a good investment.  And I don't think it is, no matter what the market thinks, because the government can't pay it back.  
Do you think the current system of just increasing the national debt will go on forever?  If not, how will it end?  And how can it end well?

Only to confirm it.  You might have taken offense at any definition I pulled out of a hat.

Actually, there's a section that says "Enter promo code" under "utilities"--do you think there's a chance I could still use your code, even though I already play the game?  If so, feel free to PM...

Ah.  OK then :)

Well, I've got a story for you.  I heard about Banksy in NYC, but figured I'd never run into him.  Then a couple days later I see some Banksy spray-painted faces on street light bases a couple of blocks from my house :).
Here's another story:  I was telling everyone to buy Bitcoin; my mom and brother bought some gigahashes in a future mining operation, but nobody bought and kept any coin.  Then inputs.io got hacked, and I lost the .46 BTC I had in it.  They were able to give most of it back, but for a while I was glad nobody took my advice and bought actual bitcoin--becuse, noob that I was, I would have told them to put it into inputs.io .  Now I kinda wish they had bought some, even if they lost some of it.  It would still be worth more than they paid for it.
