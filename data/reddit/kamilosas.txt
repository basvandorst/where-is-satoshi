So 7 year old girl knows, what is Bitcoin and how to use Reddit. I cannot believe that so many people is so naive and trust this made up story:-) Maybe I am wrong, but really hard to believe.

It has nothing to do with legal status of Bitcoin. They just do not want to allow competition in their network, before they will launch their own payments system.  . No one can expect form Apple as the biggest world patent a copyright troll to allow opensource became the major mean of payment in their network.

Just go to  , paste in your tracking number and you will see, that the package has been shipped already. Because you have choosen normal free shipping option, you need to wait now. I can recommend to pay next time some extra money for DHL express shipping and you do not need to wait so long.

Czech Republic is also amongst 6 European countries with the highest Bitcoin ATM density. There is 1 ATM for every 1.86mil. people.
Another interesting fact is from Google Trends, where Czech Republic is in top 5 world countries with the highest interest about Bitcoin.
 , just a five points behind the USA. btw. - check the search graph which quite nicely correlate with Bitcoin price in time:-)
Anyway I am most proud on SatoshiLabs and their Trezor. Small startup from small country in central Europe which has so big impact on Bitcoin ecosystem is pretty cool. Trezor is now being used in 68 world countries counting several thousand happy Trezor owners, who does not need to take care about their Bitcoin security anymore. After Avast and AVG another great company from Czech focused on security. Proud to be Čech:-)

That is true, but in compare with quite difficult process getting Bitcoin thru some exchange this process saves quite a lot of time and it is easy way even for not really tech-savvy people to get some Bitcoin, which was the main point of this service. Also they need to cover the fees charged them from company which is handling the transactions on the terminals.

The Easycoin service easycoin.wbtcb.com ,mentioned by Slush is just one directional - fiat to BTC. However there are 3 two-way Robocoins in Czech where you can swap your BTC for Czech fiat.
