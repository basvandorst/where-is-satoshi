How much did all that cost?  I'd love to do that with my miners, but I don't know how cost effective it would be.  Love to hear more!

With this, it's just important to recognize that the numbers thrown around are approximations because a transaction with that many outputs is very large, and therefore counts itself as many transactions in the TPS count.

Thanks!  
Make it automatic so that anything on (address or TXID) automatically gets a post with a link to the block explorer.

No, not quite what I meant, my mistake.  It was a big publicity stunt he pulled a while back though, his picture was on for almost a month.

Initially it was just intended for educational purposes.  We have removed all traces of this project, as you are right.  We are going to contact both support teams of the companies and notify them of this problem to ensure that nobody can take advantage of it in the future.  We're very sorry for any harm caused.

I don't have a very great printer, but if anyone out there wants to take pictures for demonstrations, it would be appreciated.

Great!  PM me if you have any other questions.

I use Electrum for almost everything.  It's more of a power-user wallet, but I still recommend it to beginners.  Everything is out in the open.  You go to the addresses tab, label an address, and then use that address.  You can easily keep track of your addresses, see which ones you've used, see your transaction history (and label it, for easy reference in the future), and many other features!

This certainly looks pretty great.  I think the address stats is going to be the killer part of this app (so that we don't have to include BCI links for address stats).
Another idea, make it so that it crawls searching for addresses and TXIDs to provide BCI links to (or maybe another block explorer, because we all know how useless BCI is).
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:48:30
Of course!
So Electrum is an HD wallet, meaning that it generates a seed for you, and from that seed all your addresses are derived.  The seed is represented as 12 random words (making it easy to write down and memorize).
All you need to do is backup your seed (write it down on paper, stick it in the bank, what ever you choose to do - they tell you your seed when you create the wallet), and then export your labels to Dropbox (it only says what you labelled each transaction/address to keep track of them into the future).

That's actually a feature we're going to include eventually!  We did have it hard-coded initially, but we decided we wanted to release something first.  It wouldn't be very hard to do. 
It would provide greater support for altcoins, which was a major goal we had in mind!
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:12:02
The idea is that you can just leave it as is, and then if you need to read it, you could take a Sharpie, pain, etc. to color it so that you can see it.
I don't have a very good printer, so if anyone else wants to print and take pictures, it would be appreciated.
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:02:46
That's a big part of his platform, of course we've seen it.  What kind of question is that.
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:14:31
Yes!  That's exactly how it works.  
I have 3 different wallets so that I can keep privacy between them.  One is my cold storage wallet, where I don't keep the seed on the computer.  However, Electrum can still generate addresses with the seed (it's really a kind of magic).  If someone steals my computer, they can't access the coins in my cold storage wallet.  (none of that really answers your question, just a fun fact about Electrum)
However, I have the same seeds on two computers, and then export the labels into Dropbox, let it sync, and then import them into the other computer's Electrum.  Both wallets look identical after this, and that's how I manage addresses across multiple computers.
Any other questions? :)

Great to see, good work Gavin

Good comments, I don't have a great printer, and haven't done much testing with it yet.  I will be doing that though, and probably changing the text size (it's on my todo list on my whiteboard).
@_date: 2015-06-24 16:10:51
Yes, once we have it closer to production (and more people have reviewed and tested it), we will release Windows and Mac binaries. 
@_date: 2015-08-06 15:52:46
It's a neat idea of course, but keep a copy of the private keys so that you can redeem it in a year or two if nobody claims it (and just throws your seemingly useless piece of paper in the trash).  How stupid would you feel if you gave away 0.01 BTC, they never used it, and then the bitcoin went up to $100,000 and you're sitting there banging your head against a wall.

Thank you very much for all of that clarification, much appreciated.
Do you think you'll work on updating, better documenting, etc. your GitHub project?
Update: Changes made, thanks for the clarification!
@_date: 2015-08-06 22:35:51
You're stupid for trusting that person.  If someone gave me $20 of anything on a piece of paper, I'd transfer it off of that piece of paper and onto my phone where I can put it on my own piece of paper.

It's not totally betting, but it's kind of like it.  You can check out  ...it's a pretty fun game, and if you play it right you're pretty much guaranteed a return.
BitBet.us is another great site I've bet with before.  Check it out.

What do you even mean?  I'm all for donating to people and getting involvement like this.  However, I am against burning when people just don't care, lose the piece of paper, etc.
If they're going to use it, they're going to get a wallet on their phone, transfer it, etc.  If they're not going to use it, then you just burnt $5 of bitcoin (or $5000 if the price goes up).  On the piece of paper, the best way to do it is write a little note that says "redeem within 2 years of 1/1/2016".  It's similar to how ChangeTip works.  If I were to ever leave a bitcoin tip with a waiter or something, I'd do it the same way ChangeTip does it: if it's not collected eventually (who cares what the time frame is), then you take it back as they just didn't care.  You are helping spread bitcoin adoption, and you can now attempt to give that away to someone else who's way more interested.  Makes sense, yes?
@_date: 2015-08-08 19:44:05
No, store it on a Trezor.  A Trezor is so much better and easier to use.

If I ever gave you a Visa gift card, I sure hope you don't get so confused that you can't use it. It has an expiration date and everything, I can't even imagine you figuring it out.  Dates are so confusing.

Block explorers are pretty great, but if you're looking for a tool that's easier to use with these block explorers, check out the [CryptoLookup Chrome extension](  We are accepting suggestions for block explorers to add, so feel free to suggest your favorite explorer.

I feel kind of bad for that company.  Not that I don't love that Bitcoin might get a little more push, but their company will die a slow death unless they have some way of leveraging bitcoin use.

We are currently looking at developing a feature that displays popups with the address information so you don't even need to open the block explorer (without users needing to manually update the permission when the extension is updated).
However, we are probably going to remove that permission request because it's worrying some people.
If you're really feeling untrustworthy, just load it from the original repo.  Hopefully some people find this extension useful!
