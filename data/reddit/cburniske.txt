yeah, the 2nd section has the CEO of a public bitcoin company... BTCS. $700K market cap. who knew?!
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:39:32
if we assume that we knew the addresses, i understand how the miners could blacklist. but what i don't get is how do they "reorg" the blockchain without rolling back entirely? a reorg sounds like the forced movement of bitcoin w/o priv key, which from my understanding is impossible...

i would go with "trust minimized" transactions. using "trustless" makes heads spin from my experience. do like the idea of stressing: "blockchain: the protocol that decentralizes trust"

thanks! did my best to keep things understandable for the broader public. do wish i had mentioned hardware wallets :-/ next time

R3 and Ethereum involved, would have been more secure to anchor in Bitcoin OP_RETURN or something similar. not sure on how specifically that would function, though...

uncorrelated means closely bound to 0, so essentially indifferent to the movement of the capital markets. though bitcoin has gone from slight positive correlation to mid-negative correlation with gold over the last few years which is really interesting... possibly some gold bugs transforming into bitcoin bugs

that's an interesting thought - while the Winklevoss twins are wealthy (and likely made a killing on their crypto holdings) I don't think they could afford ARK at this point. In terms of changing up the ETF holdings, the SEC would have some issues with so drastically changing an ETF b/c each ETF has specific descriptions about what it's going to hold (for example, we can't buy something past 10% of the overall ETF), so that's likely a no go. I would say someone will likely bring a pure play bitcoin ETF roughly 2-3 years from now, and someday you may also see "bitcoin/blockchain theme driven ETFs" once we have companies in the space going public

if you want more detail, you can see all the holdings and % weighting of our next gen internet fund (ticker: ARKW) here, which includes GBTC:  - you can also sign up for emails that we send out about ten minutes to an hour after we make a batch of trades. transparency will creatively disrupt and rebuild the financial services, at least that's our mission

Thrilled about the conversation my segment sparked, if anyone wants to contact me directly in the future my twitter handle is  Go bitcoin :-)

how so? if my sound bites weren't enough then I'd refer you to a white paper I wrote with Coinbase that dove deep into bitcoin as an asset ( another I wrote with Art Laffer on bitcoin from the perspective of fulfilling currency use cases ( and another I wrote on Bitcoin's long term security model when the incentive system transfers from block rewards to purely transaction fees (

yes, we had to buy GBTC - since we manage ETFs our mandate is restricted to public securities. Therefore, while it would have been great to hold bitcoin directly, this was our only option. Of note, however, Grayscale is great to work with, and since we did it early on in GBTC's life we actually were able to buy GBTC when it traded at a discount to its NAV (average price of ~$26/27) - therefore, while people talk about the premium GBTC trades at (and rightfully so),  its price is driven entirely by market dynamics, and GBTC units are only created by people selling out of their Bitcoin Investment Trust private placements. In other words, GBTC is a quasi close ended OTC instrument. Its premium shows demand vastly outweighs supply, likely as people want to load up on GBTC in their IRAs

It's ARKW (Next Generation Internet ETF) and ARKK (Cornerstone Themes of Disruptive Innovation ETF) - bitcoin is a top 10 holding in both. Bitcoin has returned 5X for us in the ETFs, but the ETFs themselves are composed of a basket of other equities 
@_date: 2016-06-27 17:36:03
I'm not sure what sources you're drawing from, but we can agree to disagree. From my perspective bitcoin had a nice bump around the greek debt crisis, going from the low 200's and cracking 300. From friends of mine at exchanges i know they saw a spike in sign ups from that area (see here:  As you mention, yuan deval has moved the price. And while i agree that the halving has had a significant impact on bitcoin's price of late, if you look at the movements of bitcoin around Brexit it's pretty clear that the halving wasn't the only player in town...
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:27:46
No, since ARK is the issuer of the ETFs we are the ones that manage the assets inside of it, and are the only ones that can change them. But maybe the Winklevoss twins have bought our ETFs for their personal funds ;-) From what I've heard the SEC is warming to bitcoin a lot b/c there is so much activity going on (and actually the whole "blockchain" movement has helped somewhat too) and they want to learn about it. That said, the S-1 that they filed appears to have gone nowhere over the last couple of years
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:41:15
haha it's a good point - i was talking with my hands but since they don't appear on screen it gets distracting, i agree. will bring super glue next time

Whether it be kidnapping or nationalizing the mines to then 51% attack the network, do you have any constructive thoughts on how to thwart the Chinese gov in such a scenario?
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:36:26
a little late to the party here, but if you want to see ARK's research it's here:  - I'm actually the author of ARK's work around it and focus primarily on Bitcoin and Blockchain matters these days. Have done a lot to look at the security of the mining network (i.e., if things switch to fee per $ spent as opposed to fee per byte size of transaction, then fees need never rise &gt;1.2% to sufficiently secure the network from a rational attacker), and am currently digging into securitization/asset components of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-10-19 13:43:08
i've thought about this - but would core devs + miners be willing to move quickly enough to do so? 
@_date: 2016-10-21 12:52:54
you bring up good points, and no matter what banks do, i think bitcoin will survive :-) as for charging by amount sent, I understand that's not currently how things are done, and may never be done that way. one of my concerns, however, is when the system is entirely supported by transaction fees and it costs the same amount to send $100,000 as $1, then miners may not be properly incentivized to build out a sufficiently secure network - this becomes more so the case with colored coins (like transferring ownership of a house), if that dream ever becomes revived

I wrote a white paper on this called "Securing the Network," which covers a lot of components, including CapEx + OpEx + time value of money, etc. It's a year+ old, but abstract is here if interested: "In the coming decades the mining incentive structure of the Bitcoin network is set to shift from block rewards to transaction fees. For this transition to be effective, the network needs to remain robust enough to prevent a 51% attack, while continuing to facilitate transactions at a low cost. Once block rewards phase out, ARK Invest’s research demonstrates that a transaction fee of 1.2% would be sufficient to incentivize the buildout of a network that is secure from an economically profitable 51% attack, regardless of bitcoin’s market cap and the capital allocation of a nefarious miner." The flaw here is I ran the analysis from the perspective of a transaction fee being applied per $ of value transferred, b/c it's too hard to predict the byte size of transactions going forward, which is how fees are currently levied.

not the intent of my post. trying to figure out what's behind the decline. imagine some is due to washington, but want to know what the economics are looking like. important if you care about the long term security of bitcoin.

so then indirectly the blockchain is storing the balance of each user, but that is only manifested explicitly in the UTXO which miners store in memory? would it be worthwhile/feasible to have a merkle root of a UTXO database, similar to what's going to happen with SegWit where we'll have a merkle root of the signatures stored in each block?
