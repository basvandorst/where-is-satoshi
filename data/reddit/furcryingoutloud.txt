I'm building an escrow site and have a question. If I set up segwit, will fees immediately be reduced, or do we have to wait until more wallets are segwit compatible?
My research tells me no, there will be no immediate effect on price even using segwit addresses. Anybody want to chime in I'd greatly appreciate some input.

Why is he wrong? What does coinbase do the you call it P2P? please explain the process or provide a link that does?
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:40:21
The wallet is on coinbase servers. The merchant controls the wallet by logging onto a coinbase server. It is a wallet issued by coinbase. It can be said that it is p2p but not within the spirit of Bitcoin's meaning. It mentions nothing about who controls the keys. They can call it p2p all they want, it's still misleading. Nothing stops coinbase from taking control of the Bitcoin on said wallet. If they generate the address for the merchant, they have the private key. Nothing in what I have read so far indicates that the merchant uploads addresses to the system. That would be the only way to make it truly p2p. I would have to go through more of their API, but again, I went through some of it and it does not mention anything about allowing the merchant to generate their own addresses and uploading them for use on coinbase.

The worse has come to those of us who have lost big money on bitcoin or other crypto. But to be honest, I don't think there will be a worse for bitcoin. Oh sure, prices will go up and down, and some people will lose their shirts. But that does not mean bitcoin is going down.
Bitcoin took a dive last January, but the price was as high as it was because people were placing bets. Excitement was running high, people just could not control themselves. But it most certainly was not bitcoin's fault. To blame bitcoin would be to shirk responsibility for your actions.
I am not looking at price when I say bitcoin will get better. Bitcoin prices and trading are for gamblers. I look at coverage, acceptance. The more acceptance, the higher the price has to go. 21 million coins can only go so far as acceptance and use rises. It's pure math. 
Those of us who believe in crypto should be working on spreading its use among the people we know. Developers should be looking for ways to make adoption easier. We need to work on getting it into more hands. This alone will slowly drive up the price.
Sorry for the wall of text, but the short answer is, I don't think it will get worse.
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:21:25
Some things I think are being overlooked or not totally understood. Bitcoin's decentralization will remain unaffected forever. Regardless of how many banks join in the investment melee. As long as I can download a copy of the bitcoin server and run it on my machine, it will stay decentralized. Banks can fork it, and centralize their fork, but they cannot centralize bitcoin.
Their involvement is good and bad. My personal opinion is that they will drive up the price. They want to make money too. Once they are invested in it, it will be almost impossible to kill it. So it becoming a world currency is a step closer. 
The only thing needed for bitcoin to become a currency is wider acceptance. It may not be recognized by governments as a currency, but anyone who has purchased something using bitcoin has used it as a currency. Governments print their own currency. You expect them to recognize bitcoin as a currency? Really? They can effect no control over bitcoin, why on earth would they recognize it as a currency? We should take what we can get and run with it. I for one am looking forward to all the new opportunities that this ETF will bring forth. If you own bitcoin, you should be excited, not worried.
I've been using it as a currency for years. But I still recognize the need for fiat. And yet, I can see a future where crypto will be the only available fiat. Just need to give it time. Will it be bitcoin? Who cares? Crypto is here to stay. And bitcoin has yet to develop into its full capabilities. This is only going to get better before it gets worse.

Calling it P2P? I'm not sure how that would work. If they provide a hosted cashier page, then they cannot call it P2P unless they are shipping the Bitcoin off to the merchant right away. But it still registers the transactions on coinbase servers. How much data they collect is unknown, but most of these places are also data farms. So it is important for people to get somewhat educated about P2P claims.
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:07:37
It so does not. 


Coinbase generates an address for the customer to pay to. The merchant then has to either request the Bitcoins from coinbase or they settle it. But no, not p2p.
BTW, it is impossible to do p2p if you are not running a full node or using a wallet.

Please correct me if I am wrong here. A credit card transaction gets an approval within seconds, this is obviously true and important. But the merchant does not take possession of the actual cash immediately. Some contracts are even as late as 30 days out. Daily settlements is not easy to get.
Bitcoin takes longer to receive the 6 industry standard confirmations, but once they are confirmed, that cash is in the hands of the merchant. As well, it is also up to the merchant to decide when to deliver the product. If I was a merchant, I would approve the transaction on the first confirmation but ship the product after the 3d at least. Even though the reason for the 6 confirmations, double spending, I believe to be moot now days. Someone please correct me if I am wrong.
My point is that comparing Bitcoin to credit cards in that fashion is like comparing oranges to apples. Since with a credit card payment, the merchant does not actually control his cash until it has settled into his bank account, and that takes way much longer than Bitcoin. At best, it's an illusion that the transaction is faster. Same illusion can be had with Bitcoin. 
To go a bit further, I seriously doubt that someone buying a coffee or some groceries can be expected to do a double spend if you accept the transaction when you see it on the Blockchain. How wrong is this?
@_date: 2019-03-28 09:58:16

Banks are among the most secretive institutions in the world. It seems like there is a conspiracy to keep a bank's working structure from even some of their highest executives.

The dollar has not been backed by gold in many, many years. That gold belongs to the central bank. It backs nothing. The US dollar is backed by confidence, period.

I am all for eliminating bank's business model as it exists today. But presenting false information while doing it is not healthy for the narrative. In truth, banks themselves are prohibited from printing money. At least in North America and Europe. Central banks do the money printing and central banks do not provide loan services to Joe Blow. They are meant to police the banks they license.
Licensed banks are allowed to lend a percentage of the money they have on account. I believe that in Europe it is up to 86% of the cash on deposit. They are lending the money that you deposit and you think you have in the bank. 86% of your money is providing loans to other people. As well as being used to generate wads of cash for your bank.
Banks in Europe are checked once per month and they MUST have 14% of their depositor's money on hand or face substantial fines. There is a reason banks are horrified by massive cash withdrawals. If enough people request their money from a bank in a short period of time, the bank can be in real trouble. I've read that some bank runs have put the fear of god into some american banks in the recent past. 
But no, banks don't print money, ever. Only central banks have that authority and then for example, in Europe, only the European Central Bank can do this. And no European country's central bank has the authority to print money.

They were not really unsecured. They were backed by actual real estate. Real estate values were artificially inflated and loans were given out to people who were allowed (wink, wink) to provide false information to increase their borrower status and many bad loans were sold as tier one loans. Enough that when these bad loans began to falter, those who bought these bundled mortgages full of overpriced real estate and bad borrowers, suddenly found themselves holding collateral that had been sold as prime but was not.
Someone correct me if I am wrong, but this was one of the results of the 2008 crisis. I'm sure there was more fraudulent activity but my brain is running on half its cylinders right now.

From people who have money in the bank. Depositor's money. Investment accounts. All those investment opportunities they sell you when you have some money.
"The net worth of Bank of America is around $2.3 trillion." from this site:
It's not an ideal site to offer as a source, but say they are worth half of that. Whatever amount they have on deposit is used to make loans, investments and if they need cash, they just sell loans on the market and replenish their cash supply. It may not sound as good as "they create money out of thin air" but it is much much closer to reality of banking.

I would not be surprised if banks began to quietly liquidate their gold before it loses most of its value. I personally believe that Bitcoin is being eyed as a possible replacement for gold as a store of value. I don't see it in the near future, but there is a reason why crypto coins is garnering so much attention by banks. It is going to get crazy at some point.
The total number of Satoshis is two quadrillion, one hundred trillion (2,100,000,000,000,000). This is the result of 21 million Bitcoins available multiplied by 100 million Satoshis per Bitcoin. This total exceeds the number of total currencies in the world by a very large sum. It is estimated that the total amount of money available in all currencies around the world is about 100 trillion (100,000,000,000,000).
Bitcoin alone can easily replace the supply once it gains enough age and the systems mature enough to handle such volumes. The path has been set, it is now time to follow it and see where it leads. I for one am very curious to see what quantum computing will do to the space considering each year we move closer to being able to achieve quantum computer systems. It's going to get crazy. Bitcoin will take on many different forms in the next 20 years. It is going to be exciting to see.
The first credit card was introduced about 70 years ago. Bitcoin has been around what, 10 years? I'll bet any amount of money that no credit card company, 10 years into the creation of the first card, was able to handle the amounts of volume being handled today. Bitcoin needs time, it's very simple.
@_date: 2019-03-28 10:21:45
From money bank already has on deposit. The reason a bank seems to be able to lend money without limits is that, they bundle these loans and sell them on the market to institutional investors for a smaller profit than the mortgage will make in its lifetime. This allows them to make a profit and recover the money they lend you almost immediately. Rinse and repeat. A large bank can probably bundle a sizable amount of loans per week. Generating enough profits to make their stockholders happy. But I repeat, there is no black magic fuckery there where they are creating money out of thin air.

Money is not used as cash any more. Say you deposit 1000 into your bank A. You then send your money to me in bank B. It is very possible that someone else in bank B is sending someone money to someone in bank A. So instead of settling these transactions each time one is made, they are settled say, at the end of the day. So basically, the only thing traded between the banks is the remaining balance due on the final settlement of that day or whenever their agreements indicate their trades to be settled. It is all done via ledgers. It is very likely that the trading is a wash and no actual money changes hands. So if the depositors from bank A send 1000 to the depositors of bank B, there is no need to exchange cash.
The reality is that not all US dollars are actually in paper money. I don't remember what the amounts are right now, but the number of actual paper bills is much, much lower than the actual amount of currency available. That check you wrote to pay your electricity bill? Chances are, the electric company will never see that in cash.
It is difficult to obtain exact numbers, but some figures I have seen seem to show that only ten percent or thereabouts of the total amount of US dollars available are in printed or coined hard cash. Here is a link that provides some idea of world hard cash versus electronic money.

I don't think it's that easy. Maybe somebody who knows who actually owns the gold in reserve can weigh in on this. But it would seem to me that if the government is holding the gold, it is there in reserve for any drastic circumstance and selling it merely to extract the funds is not part of the plan for that reserve. Not knowledgeable enough about gold reserves in the US to make anything other than a guess.

This transaction, if it appears on the blockchain, is a valid transaction. A transaction that is broadcast to any connected node will generate a txid and the only way to undo that transaction is via a replacement. In order to replace that transaction with a higher fee, this transaction would have to be removed by flagging the new transaction as a replacement to this one IF the initial transaction was flagged as replaceable. Otherwise, there is no way to replace that transaction.
I would be very interested in seeing your scenario occur in a verifiable environment. Care to test this on testnet?
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:30:29
The mempool is not separate from the bitcoin database. It is just a flag on the transaction stored on each receiving node, but still available to all nodes. It's not like the mempool is a hidden box somewhere, it's all in the same database and the txid's are shared.
I'm not against Lightning, I just believe that bitcoin is capable enough without having to add more layers.
Did you guys ever have trouble with 0-conf transactions? Or were you just taking steps to eliminate the possibility by using Lightning?
@_date: 2019-08-26 14:27:47

The mem-pool can be manipulated, but I'd like to see someone provide a recent example of a successful double spend. The google searches related to double spending are just a bunch of non-tech blog posts that don't say much.
I'm still not convinced that this double spending remains a worrisome issue. I'll concede it can be done in very isolated cases, but I don't believe it is worth the trouble for smaller transactions.

Do you have any information as to the actual requirements? And what jurisdictions require this?
All this KYC bullshit began when the supposed owner of BTC-e was arrested in Greece. I have yet to see any law, regulation, or government agency documents that demand KYC for the purchase of Bitcoin under the amount of 10k.
I am not attacking you, but I am searching for any legal document that shows the requirements. Not the words on a website that claim they are requirements.
Clearly, the amount of data that these companies are collecting exceed banking regulations for any country in the world. Make a 20 dollar bitcoin purchase and you have to give them your DNA? This certainly beats the hell out of one of the reasons bitcoin was designed as an anonymous coin to begin with. And incidentally plays right into the government's wish to collect data from all sources.
Why ask for KYC when there is a bank involved? Credit card purchases are backed by a bank who has already collected extensive KYC on the crad holder, so there should be no fear of someone not being able to be identified. Wire transfers, same thing. 
Most countries' central banks require KYC when a transaction exceeds 10k euros or dollars. Why give these companies so much data to buy some bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-25 01:25:31


amount of money,” transactions involving CVC qualify as transmittals of funds,
and thus may fall within the Funds Travel Rule.37
37. “Funds Travel Rule,” see 31 CFR § 1010.410(f).
 Under the Funds Travel Rule, a
transmittal of funds of $3,000 or more (or its equivalent in CVC) may trigger certain
requirements on a money transmitter acting as either the financial institution for the
transmittor or recipient, or as an intermediary financial institution. 
This is [FinCEN Guidance, FIN-2019-G001, May 9, 2019]( page 11, paragraph 3.
Basically a transaction of over 3k will trigger specific requirements. In the absence of requirements for transactions of under 3k, I am forced to conclude that these supposed companies are overreacting when demanding full KYC for clients who purchase under 3k in any transaction.
IOW, if a client comes in and buys $200 worth of bitcoin, and uses a credit/debit card  or a wire transfer, there should be no need to collect further KYC from said customer other than the pertinent information needed to complete said transaction. The client's name, address and card number/bank account number should be more than enough information for any authority to properly identify the client if anything were to be found suspicious about the transaction.
My whole point is that unless a certain threshold is reached in volume, casual buyers should NOT be forced to fork over more identifying information to sites such as coinbase, regardless of whether they are a financial institution or not. It is overkill and it should not be happening. Just the risk of identity theft in the event of a server breach could be devastating to those who trusted these websites. And there are no clear guidelines anywhere on how to preserve this valuable data like there are for Visa and Mastercard merchants who must comply with rigorous guidelines on cardholder data procedures.
Not a Lawyer either...

No, the transactions are recorded on the blockchain prior to receiving their first confirmation. They are recorded as soon as they are broadcast to the nodes. At that point, we have a txid but zero confirmations.
They remain with zero confirmations until a miner picks it up. But they have a txid on the network way before they receive their first confirmation.
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:46:15
Here's the problem. We're overlooking the fact that all these zero conf transactions still receive a txid number, and the mempool is shared. Otherwise, each node could only show the transactions it is holding. The blockchain, as much as we may want to complicate it, still uses a database, and all these transactions, zero confirmations or not, have a commonly shared txid which is stored in the collective databases.


In a nutshell, I'm saying the same exact thing and adding that we should not be scared to accept low value transactions once we confirm a txid. Obviously, low value is the key here, and all in an attempt to argue against the validity of using bitcoin in a merchant environment. I see no issues in accepting a low value transaction once it has received a txid.

Thank you sir. I'm travelling today, but I still want to pursue this line of thought. I will be doing more research on this next week.

This is simply not true anymore. The cost of doing a double spend today is simply too high to merit even attempting it for smaller transactions. And by smaller transactions, I mean transactions that are usually the norm for shopping. 
This is one of the fears that were prevalent years ago and have not disappeared because, well, fear. Today, a bitcoin transaction can be deemed to be completed when it hits the blockchain.

@_date: 2019-08-24 23:03:49
Don't worry about quibbling. We're having what I believe to be a civil discussion.
And I disagree. The transaction receives a txid upon being broadcast. It is on the blockchain with zero confirmations. But having a txid makes it exponentially more difficult to double spend or do anything funny with it. The server will reject any duplicates.


On the contrary. A simple look at any blockchain explorer as soon as you send a transaction will show you the txid and zero confirmations. Again, once you have a txid, that transaction is stored in the blockchain and it would take a very strong miner to do anything with it in order to replace it or take a second "duplicate" transaction if you will.
Basically, a double spend, once a transaction has been recorded would require a hard fork of the chain. And can only be done by a miner with the hashing strength to force a hard fork of the chain. 
A simple google search will show that these double spend problems were much more prevalent back in 2013 when the network was still young enough and the hashing power needed to perform a double spend was not nearly as it would be today. That's right, they didn't have to fix it because the pure length of the chain is today preventing double spends simply by being so long.
My argument is not that it isn't possible to do, just that nobody in their right mind would do it on a transaction of a few bitcoin or less. Now on a 100 bitcoin transaction, yeah, wait for the 6 or 10 confirmations before you accept it as being paid. But smaller transactions? My argument is that we've surpassed that danger and can rest easy now. Surely, a store selling merchandise for $50 will never have to worry about a double spend or any tricky situation by accepting a transaction as finished when the txid is generated and stored in the chain at zero confirmations.

Panic. The single most dangerous emotion in trading. Ever.
In Bitcoin, it is easy to make a buy at the exact wrong time. Example, yesterday, I bought at 7650. It immediately dipped. What am I doing? Absolutely nothing. Not even watching the price. I will look every few hours, but no intention of selling unless and if it hits 7850 or 8k.

You mean, fake in like, the money you see on your computer screen at your bank's website? Because that money is backed by nothing but  a song and a prayer. And it's about as fake as you can get. And only guaranteed up to 100k in most countries. Yes, a false sense of security for all.
This reminds me of when the Cyprus government needed money and just decided to take 10% of all the money in its banking system. Just waltzed into the banks and took it. Bitcoin? Yeah, that could not happen.
There are many things wrong with bitcoin. Things that a slew of people are working their asses off to fix. But the one thing that is a constant is that when you own bitcoin, it's yours. Nobody can take it unless by force or via hacking you. Bitcoin cannot be hacked, but people's lack of security awareness can be.

You obviously have not read up enough on bitcoin to understand that it is not changed easily. Changes to the code must be consensual amongst the whole of the developers working on it.
I would suggest doing some reading, especially about the blockchain and how it works. There is a reason why most governments have opted for some type of adoption before banning it outright.
There are many pitfalls. To deny them would be to lie. But for every pitfall, there is a very easy solution.
And finally, I have some very bad news for you, that money in your bank account? Yeah, computer code, because it is not backed by cash money. If you think otherwise, go and try and withdraw 100k at your bank and see what happens. They will need to prepare the withdrawal, and chances are it will take days. This is precisely why Satoshi dreamed up bitcoin.
Our whole lives now revolve around computer code. And if I was going to take any chance on computer code, I'd take bitcoin over a bank's code anytime. Nobody actually controls bitcoin. Hell, they can't even shut it down. Seriously man, you should do some reading about this fascinating step forward in computer programming.

OP, good post. Good questions too. This seems like something that is never really discussed anywhere because it's something people don't find everyday.
Here's what I would do if I were you.
**DO NOT TELL THE WIFE**
For now, stay quiet. Never give anyone the knife they can use to stab you in the back. Yes, even your wife. You want to ruin a relationship? Throw money at it. Plain and simple, people react strongly (badly) to money. Consider this as well, how will your wife react to you having hid this from her for all these years? This may be the deal that breaks up your marriage. Consider the decision to tell her, carefully. Be ready for the worse reaction. Worse reaction is she will accuse you of lying by omission, ask for a divorce based on exactly this and demand half the investment for herself, and get it. You should fear this more than the tax man.
**DO NOT TELL THE WIFE**
Speak to several attorneys and accountants. Preferably with some tax experience on both counts.
**DO NOT TELL THE WIFE**
Now on to what I would do.
    1. Buy a corporation (I would open a foreign one and not in a known tax haven) England, Ireland to name just two are good solid places. 
        You'll have to do some travelling. Notice I said buy and not open. You will want to buy an off the shelf corporation older than the time 
        you bought the bitcoins.
    2. Assign ownership of the bitcoins to said corporation ( you will need the advice of your attorney and accountant ) 
    3. Become an employee of the corporation (You will pay taxes on the salary, not on the 200 bitcoins), after all, you want your bitcoins to 
        continue to grow and grow they will. You do not pay tax on money you have not collected. So as long as the bitcoins do not get 
        exchanged and are held, you owe no tax. At least where I live, it's this way (Europe).
    4. Use the corporation to invest in passive income producing ventures and or stocks (or leave the bulk of the investment in Bitcoins, 
        can't go wrong right?)
    5. You want to be sure you do not stray on your taxes. You WILL pay a high price for doing so, especially in the US from what I hear, 
        so make sure to double check the advice you are given and get second opinions. Trust, but verify.
Bitcoins appreciated 685% in the past 12 months, you will find no better investment at this stage. Just stay away from other coins and stick to Bitcoin.
With this setup, you can easily take a 10k per month salary, pay your taxes on the 10k, remaining legal and continue to watch your investment grow.

And you would be completely correct. Their existence alone indicates that they have the opportunity to exist along with others. Markets will decide what is best for them.
So yes, they do not, and should not be expected to compete amongst themselves. Each has special use cases that will attract users based on their needs. Good point!

Yes, but that is not the logic involved. Not quite. Look at the diamond industry, it will give you some insights as to the value of scarcity. But for that to occur, people have to value that commodity. One bitcoin is scarce, but it being divisible by 100 milion easily takes care of that problem.
Bitcoin is valuable because it is a trustless technology. Meaning you don't have to put your faith in any institution. It is valued more than others because it was the pioneer, and it has remained basically the same as when it launched. All the other "me too" coins have yet to offer something bitcoin does not. The ones that do, like monero and etherium, have not yet been able to replace the utility of bitcoin.
Until a coin emerges that can actually offer better functionality and better marketing, bitcoin is it. It should be noted that bitcoin was not marketed, it grew organically. That's always going to be hard to beat.

To sort of answer your question. Yes, Bitcoin is limited. It is limited in order to prevent inflation within. Example, you cannot generate new bitcoin to cover debt. 
This obviously creates a problem because how do you compensate for the limits? The answer to this is that one bitcoin can be broken up into 100 million satoshis. Which means that an increase in price is the solution to this supposed limit problem. A bitcoin can be divided into 100 million satoshis. 
17 million bitcoins X 100 million satoshis = 1,700,000,000,000,000, that's "one trillion seven hundred billion" satoshis in total, a fuckton of possible value in just one bitcoin. Because essentially, one satoshi could reach a price of one dollar and a bitcoin would be worth 100 million dollars. To give some insight, "As of November 6, 2019 there was $1.74 trillion worth of Federal Reserve notes in circulation."
[How much U.S. currency is in circulation? -- 
Based on this math, bitcoin at $100 million would almost cover the full USD in circulation today. Need to cover more? Up goes the price of a satoshi.
Of course, this is all anecdotal stuff, and not to be taken as a prediction of bitcoin's future value. But the math does back up the decision to limit its emission.

I wasn't disagreeing with you, I just thought mentioning its immaturity felt necessary.

Never compared it to diamonds. Referred to the scarcity tactics used by the diamonds industry to increase the value of diamonds. It can be applied to anything really, potatoes? Prices increase relative to its scarcity.


Yes, yet Etherium has never competed with Bitcoin on a price level. Nor, according to my understanding, been as wide spread.
@_date: 2019-12-03 09:13:25
Bitcoin's volatility just points to it's immaturity. It can not be used to measure its technological prowess which is truly the "the most perfect form of money humans have yet created".
Just ten years ago, Tesla was considered a toy. It is now beginning to scare a lot of dinosaurs. Pun intended.

Of course. It's just that I don't see much of a chance, at this point, for any of these coins to overtake Bitcoin in adoption. Not for any other reason other than, we humans are fickle creatures, and generally stick to what's known and it's hard to argue bitcoin's recognition status over these other coins.
I don't pretend to choose one over the other. Though I have no qualms about admitting my preference for bitcoin.
But to be sure, from here on out, adoption is key and the winner will be the one that covers more territory in the adoption game. Regardless of its price or market cap.
@_date: 2019-12-03 10:02:08
It doesn't. But we will always need a comparison metric for its value, and there is none other than existing fiat. Simply because it is fiat that we use to value anything and everything in life.
Bitcoin can only ever become another form of fiat. It will never fully replace it. Actually, it doesn't need to replace fiat. Though I can imagine it eventually will for many individuals.
@_date: 2019-04-26 08:12:35
Ok, I can see the problem, and it wasn't bitcoin. It's they have no cash. I can also see how the bat coin provided them the solution. Still, I would think it would be so much better with bitcoin. Lol.

If we take every study conducted by humans as literally as you're taking this, then every single study would be flawed.
OP's numbers are to be taken as anecdotal, and not scientific. Still, it's a hell of a comparison and indicative of the power of bitcoin. It should not be taken as a study conducted with triple blind tests.
Hell, people believe in the bible and don't question it.

Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done about the bitcoin website. Anyone can do that and as long as a court doesn't decide it's illegal, all we can point to is them being borderline frauds. I'm sure that if what they were doing was illegal, they would have by now, been formally accused of criminal activity. That I know of, they haven't, yet.
There is only so much that the community in general can do to safeguard idiots from buying worthless and useless coins. And from my perspective, everything that can be done is being done already in one form or another. The truth of the matter is that if someone is ignorant enough to fall for the Roger scam, then the blame is on them.


In a perfect world, most definitely agree. But these guys are like cockroaches, you couldn't kill them with an atomic bomb. And if you did manage to kill them, more would come out of the woodwork. Bottom line, it's all about education. But as long as idiots keep waking up in the morning with expendable cash burning holes in their pockets, someone will be right there to relieve them of that pesky cash burden.
@_date: 2019-04-26 02:09:03
There is that. Still, if they have real advertisers, they could have collected fees in bitcoin. But I get what you're saying. So Brave is really just another shitcoin push.
This is what actually gets me about all this. Very few, maybe none, of the projects out there are using bitcoin as their base coin. I understand the view of free money, but shit, bitcoin projects would have so much more strength. This Gab browser might upend Brave. Which obviously concerns Brave greatly.

The arguments in the petition, although mostly true, are not well prepared and therefore, it doesn't seem to me to be a petition that will be going anywhere.
The argument for or against BCH, like any political campaign, is mired in truths sprinkled with nonsensical statements. Like, Roger Ver is bad, very bad is not a statement to be taken seriously. And considering the overwhelming amount of evidence against good ol Roger, the arguments made in the petition fall woefully short in convincing anyone that BCH is a scam.
I am a bitcoin guy. Will likely never be anything else. I just can't see any other coin taking up any market share for actual use case, not like bitcoin has anyway. And when I say use, I don't mean use like Ripple or Iota. I mean general public use. Also, the coin that leads the way in the markets has always been, and will always be BTC.
It's fine to cash in on the trading with other coins and real traders would be foolish to ignore the profits from trading in shit coins. But from there, to backing coins that have no real world use is another long, really long shot.
Shit coins will eventually die off and BTC will either transform or move aside for an as of yet developed coin. For now though, BTC is the only serious coin in publicly available circulation.
Delisting or not, of any coin is just noise in a system full of radio chatter.

Ok, this makes it slightly better. Got any info on their fees? The last time I checked an ATM, fees were like 12% over market price. It would be good to know what fees they plan to charge for the coin exchange. Thanks for the info man.
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:56:46
I'm not familiar. But I would not doubt that the fees will be ridiculous in any case. They usually are at bitcoin ATM's anyway. Add the coin machine fees and yeah, probably broaching on predatory.

Practically useless. You get a voucher that allows you to go somewhere else to collect your bitcoin. So nothing stopping you from selling your coins to coinstar and then finding a coinme atm to go buy bitcoin. You would save whatever fees their charging for that "service".
Jeez, you would figure they could come up with a way to deliver your bitcoin to you without forcing you to make two trips. This is a failing venture no matter how you look at it. No kind of benefit to the user at all.

I'm gonna do this again. And state that comparing Visa's ability to accept transaction at 45k per second to Bitcoin's ability to process its transactions is really a moot point. While true that Visa can handle a shitload of transactions, it merely provides sort of a recording of transactions. It takes days or weeks and sometimes up to 30 days for the merchant to receive their money. If that is all that bitcoin did, then yeah, I'm sure it would be child's play to make it meet or exceed Visa's capabilities.
But Bitcoin delivers the goods, something which Visa fails to do. The approved transaction is all that it is. And though many people consider that to be enough, the merchant's money is not secure until it reaches their bank account, which is not guaranteed to happen as quickly as Bitcoin can deliver the actual commodity to the receiver.
TLDR; Visa does not deliver funds in the time Bitcoin does. It delivers a recording of the transaction. We'll send your cash later, whenever.
@_date: 2019-01-20 10:46:19
You talk like I'm upset that someone is making money. I'm not. It's just that this seems to me to be redundant as a service to buy bitcoin. It does seem like it could be useful to some, but it doesn't really offer anything more than what is out there already. And I do understand it may have it's own niche market segment, but it doesn't do anything for me.
@_date: 2019-01-19 16:55:39
Yes, but I missed any part of where you could claim your bitcoin online. It just says you would be guided to an ATM machine where you can collect your bitcoin. I don't know, it just seems like a pretty convoluted way to get bitcoin. Certainly nothing to brag about.
