My question is about updating the bitcoin protocol and creating a *fork* in the blockchain.
If and when the bitcoin protocol is updated (maybe there's a big update to change the transaction speed, for example) the decentralised nature of the bitcoin network will create a fork (i.e. you can't enforce everyone to update at the same time).
A fork in practise means there's two 'alt coins' BTC v1 and BTC v1.1 for example, both spendable and valid as crypto currencies. My observation is this, without a 100% agreed upon time for the update to be made (agreed by shops/companies accepting bitcoin) there is a possibility to spend your bitcoin v1 and bitcoin v1.1 at different locations and have a double spend. Having this 100% agreed upon transition time (between bitcoin versions) isn't easy in a decentralised network, unless a company like BitPay has a complete monopoly over managing bitcoin transactions, which again goes against bitcoin's nature.
**How are these update-forks dealt with? Is this a major problem for bitcoin?**

Thanks, corrected.

As is, the best we can do is charts like [Estimated daily USD transaction volume]( As mentioned of most these transactions don't correspond to purchases.
Companies like BitPay, if they gain large acceptance, could make more accurate estimates but still they wouldn't be able to know about transactions not made through them.

The bank account balances are good as an analogy, but there are no actual balances stored anywhere with bitcoin. A 'balance' can be inferred by inspecting the blockchain and looking at the transactions, but when you create a transaction you're really just handing on transactions that were made to you, digitally signing them and passing them to miners so they can add it to the blockchain. At which point the recipient of the transaction can send it on to others and so on. There's no account balances actually stored anywhere.

1) A ponzi scheme is a series of investments in a fabricated company where money from each investment gets send to the con-artist running it and the previous investors, creating the illusion of a succesfull investment to the initial investors, which causes more investment, and so on and so on until the con artist takes all the money from the latest investments and runs.
2) The creators and initial investors of bitcoin benefitted hugely from all subsequent investments, so in a very limited sense it does have some similarities to a ponzi scheme. Nobody can ever prove the intentions of the creators, but to me that's completely meaningless and unimportant anyway. The creators don't control bitcoin anymore, it's decentralised and the only influence they have is that miners will probably accept updates to the protocol if the update's written by them. They can't take money from current investors and run. They don't have access to any more money than they gave themselves at the beginning.
Whether the creators benefitted or not from bitcoin's success has got zero impact on bitcoin's versatility as a digital currency.

Doesn't OP mean if banks developed a *decentralised* altcoin, maybe with lots more developers backing it and with faster verifications, that still allowed for withdrawing coins into your local wallet and spending it in a decentralised way? In this case the decentralisation argument fails, as it's possible for banks to develop and push their own decentralised coin.

You can't make money from the 51% attack unless someone is paying you to block people's transactions. Plus, you need to keep those massive super computers running at that insane capacity if you want to keep that power over the network. Also doesn't stop alt-coins being used instead while the attack is underway. Seems *very* implausible that someone would spend so much money with quite minor payoffs.

Put simply, increasing the block size means more transactions can happen within a short time period. What if a major music festival opened ticket sales in bitcoin? You'd have tens of thousands of transactions within 10-15 minutes, which would take a substantial number of blocks (maybe as many as 30) at the 1MB limit before all of them were verified.
Bitcoin *needs* a higher block size limit if it's going to handle scenarios like these without other modifications. As far as I'm aware not many people doubt this, people do differ on the details.
A good discussion is here on reddit:

In economics, there are some agreed upon criteria that a currency must satisfy. Try adding some objectivity to your analysis by introducing these criteria (store of value, medium for exchange etc. see [Money on Wikipedia]( and describing how BitCoin fairs at providing those functions. Be careful analysing the currency from other perspectives, as the topic is extremely politically distorted by both sides; Bitcoin represents a Libertarian Paradise or a Criminal Underworld depending on who you ask, steer away from these naive extremes.
Also *please* mention the biggest misconception that circulates about Bitcoin: **It isn't anonymous.** It is pseudo-anonymous just like a user account on reddit. Furthermore all your activity is publicly visible on the blockchain. This is much less anonymous than most currency, especially cash.
The biggest barrier to truly understanding bitcoin, to me, has been the amount of ideologically charged descriptions of it; cryptocurrencies have been mostly peddled from a economic-libertarian viewpoint. There are a lot of misunderstandings here about the role of regulation and taxation on a currency, they're not necessarily evil, and bitcoin doesn't necessarily circumvent them.
Finally, consider looking at bitcoin as a product for the average consumer. This may be the largest challenge it faces; what can it provide practically for non-technical individuals that don't care about decentralisation etc. directly? Currently its dominant use is by speculators/investors, early adopters, and for trading illegal products on the tor network.
tl;dr Bitcoin isn't anonymous, be careful of idealistic descriptions of it. And it isn't yet that attractive for the average non-technical consumer.
P.S. Not anti-bitcoin, just trying to add some discussion from the other side.

Being valuable to consumers is a serious hurdle which bitcoin will have to overcome, it's fundamental properties of decentralisation and pseudo-anonymity don't matter to a lot of people. But bare in mind that banks have and will fail again, under these circumstances bitcoin might flourish as an alternative. It could gain acceptance first in developing countries with failing governments/banks.
As for the rest of us, bitcoin doesn't *replace* the banks. This is a big misconception in fact. There is (at least in theory) the possibility of a **bitcoin bank** that holds and secures your bitcoin, and offers the same financial services that the banks give us but through bitcoin. Of course consumers who choose to use these services will be knowingly sacrificing the advantages of decentralisation, but if the bitcoin-banks allow you to withdraw coin into your personal bitcoin wallet, they can't control transactions you make from that wallet.

Yep that's arguably true, I'm not really suggesting it *should* be related to GDP. But that's the direction that criticisms about inflation might go. A lot of classically trained economists believe it will fail *because* it's decentralised and inflation can't be controlled. We'll have to wait and see how it plays out though.
It's already true that most people holding bitcoin aren't willing to spend them cause they're investors relying on its future adoption and deflationary nature to store value better than fiat currencies or the products they could buy with it. A currency that's *too* good at storing value might be unsuccesfull as a currency due to the Gresham's Law.
See [Gresham's law and Bitcoin deflation]( if you're interested.
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:01:25
In macroeconomic theory, inflation is meant to rise with GDP. (It's complex, but it ideally needs to rise based on external economic activity). Bitcoin's inflation is arbitrary and isn't effected by the value of a bitcoin, or economic activity. **The rate at which new coins are created halves every few years\*.** Also 2140 is a long way away, yes, but assuming no updates to the protocol change this fact, the market will take into account this fact and treat it more as deflationary the closer we get.
Gold is still mined, but total gold resources will never increase. Gold is deflationary and so is bitcoin.
*Edit. Thanks for the correction @_date: 2014-04-14 12:26:39
1) Nope. There's no such thing as 'a bitcoin' or 'a satoshi' in the actual protocol or even the data within the blockchain. What people give to each other are *transactions*. If someone digitally signs a transaction from them to you, you then can package that transaction up and send it on to someone else by digitally signing it again. You can follow back all transaction chains to either a succesfull miner's reward, or the first ever bitcoin - the genesis block.
I'll let someone else explain 2.
