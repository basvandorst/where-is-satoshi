Love it. Just bought my first one!

Bitcoin vs altcoins aside, this is pretty cool and a big step in the right direction for privacy and fungibility.
@_date: 2016-04-01 14:37:43
Didn't you see the post recently about that company that raised a shit ton of money to investigate bitcoins and whether or not they are tainted? For this reason I put a decent amount of my coins into Monero because you can never segregate those coins into tainted vs. clean, no one can do that with XMR.

As soon as I saw how much the Bcash community praised Craig "fuckstick" Wright, I knew it had to be a sham.

If it's true privacy you want then Monero is where you should be looking m8.

Yep, you're and idiot. I wasn't saying why haven't they responded immediately, rather I was just saying I was interested in their response and I knew they had Reddit usernames. Read my comment again and try to understand the context, if it's not too hard for you.
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:51:01
Don't the coinbase guys have Reddit accounts? Someone page them so they can respond to this, I'm interested in what they have to say.
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:09:53
Hypocrite? This guy says that companies accepting bitcoin are only doing so a as a marketing schemes whereas he plays off the hype of bitcoin to sell a stupid book. Don't waste your time watching this wrinkly bag of air.
@_date: 2015-05-14 14:58:20
Need to get out at a $5 profit/coin? Unless you had a lot of coin that's pleb money.
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:35:10
the average joe has their opportunity right now, and every average joe I talk to about bitcoin calls me stupid for investing in it, so you know what? fuck the average joe.
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:00:39
It was over $100, did you miss that part? Also, you got a source for those numbers?
@_date: 2016-03-08 20:38:17
Bitcoin is not anonymous, but the great thing is it doesn't have to be. This is why altcoins matter. There are plenty of BTC clones that have added anonymity, but there are even better coins that are completely different than BTC that achieve anonymity better than any BTC clone can. Crypto can be massive, it doesn't have to be just BTC.

Not to mention, last time I checked gold transactions (send and receive) were not available in the US, only buy and sell.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:51:59
First off, I would disagree with you about being misleading as I clearly put "over $100 of referral gold" in the title. Secondly, it shouldn't matter what the people I refer to the site do, I've brought them potential customers and if after that point they don't do anything with their accounts, well that's up to them. I can slightly understand a policy like this to prevent scamming a referral program, but in order to sign up for an account you need to have an active phone line and I think that does a better job of preventing the scamming. This policy makes them look desperate  to get their hands back on the gold they give out as a reward for a referral, which is a warning sign to me that they're probably not making much money, thus the purpose of my post. Also, why did they never implement the bitcoin withdrawal option? It's probably because they want to hold onto BTC that their customers deposit.
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:53:53
You nailed it. This type of behavior makes the company look likes it hungry to get it's hands back on the referral gold, which is never a good sign. The idea is a great one, like you said I wish they had implemented it better. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 16:17:36
fuck cryptsy, Big Vern is a jibroni.
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:42:41
Such a shit service, I was waiting for them to make bitcoin withdrawals a thing but that never came to fruition. I'm not even sure what them mean by inactivity too because I have definitely logged into the account recently, I check it about once a month to see if any better withdrawal options were available.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:26:03
That's just so sketchy. It seems like they purposely made it  hard to ever withdraw from them.
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:59:41
It uses a phone number not an email address, so no they weren't mine at all.
@_date: 2016-03-28 13:31:38
just going to leave that here...
@_date: 2016-01-27 16:32:20
You make it sound like its so fucking easy to get someone's private key. It's not.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:07:38
It's just bullshit that I referred them 15+ customers. I wanted to withdraw that gold in BTC which they advertised and had a "Coming Soon" tag on the BTC withdrawal option but that never came to fruition.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:27:33

I honestly can't believe you've gone through so much trouble to try and collect on $7 that you did absolutely nothing to earn. This post reflects poorly on both of you, he's not a man of his word and you are a whining child.

As a staunch Bruins fan and a BTC holder, this brings a smile to my face after a devastating game 7 loss.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:57:18
Just want to comment in here so I can say I was here for this. Congrats everyone, champagne all around.

I'm going to go with $226.38 USD
@_date: 2016-02-10 12:53:40
What a waste of $50, seriously.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:51:19
No way they point their miners to ETC wheb there are a ton of other coins they could mine that are so obscure.
@_date: 2015-04-15 12:48:41
I'd love to give those a read as well.
@_date: 2015-11-05 18:43:51
I appreciate the reply and I'll definitely check out fiverr. I had an eerie feeling that what I was looking for didn't really exist.

@_date: 2015-03-25 16:25:35
Not trying to attack you personally, its just incredibly risky and irresponsible. Here is a coindesk article about storing your coins, hope this helps you out and I hope you're safer with your precious bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:48:25
Yeah that filter is terrible.

the new slogan of ***Bamboozled^TM***
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:31:55
Because why would you buy a "ton" of coin without out knowing jack shit about it, ESPECIALLY how to fucking store it so that no one can steal it.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:38:08
Why the fuck would you store a "ton" of BTC on the shittiest exchange there is and not be on top of this shit? You deserve to lose those coins.
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:57:19
And the saga continues.
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:11:35
I was never being snooty, it looks bad on all of us when people leave there coins on exchanges and then those coins go missing.
@_date: 2016-07-28 17:32:30
