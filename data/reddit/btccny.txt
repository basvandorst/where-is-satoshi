I just don't necessarily appreciate the fact that we're only valuing an opinion if it comes from one of these guys. 
There's been plenty of other valid proposals brought forth and ignored/forgotten.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:26:53
If you'd like to provide any verifiably accurate data to correct the original post, we can have a discussion. 
Otherwise, have a good one.

You're just embarrassing yourself at this point.
Output volume is here: 
I've gotten hundreds of upvotes, retweets, and likes. You have self pats on the back. I really do recommend looking into some mental health support.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:51:16
No worries, quantify means how do you measure it (using numbers). 
Qualify means how do you characterize it (using words).
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:22:04
Nope, transfer volume includes on-blockchain activity only, trading volume includes off-chain activity on exchanges only.
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:59:11
Where are you getting 7-8% from?
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:23:15
The research is all publicly available, and the numbers are auditable. Repeatedly complaining about the verifiable numbers not being what you want them to be doesn't change them.
@_date: 2019-06-23 15:24:04
You're just embarrassing yourself at this point. 
Output volume can be found here: 
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:35:41
The figure provided actually is less than what is currently being sent daily ($16 billion).
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:55:43
I'll take that as none.
Have a good one.
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:39:51
No worries but it's clear you do not understand blockchain dynamics. A trade on an exchange is *not* a deposit/withdrawal. Multiple trades usually occur for every one deposit/withdrawal cycle.
Feel free to send over any questions if you're interested in learning more about it!
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:30:34
How would that identify output consolidation done for fee optimization?
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:25:18
You're speaking in circles now.  
Outputs are sent (colloquially called 'spent') inputs. To ensure the most accurate figure is provided I do not try to differentiate what proportions of sent value are attributable to certain use cases (e.g. payments, fee optimization, ect).
Again, it would be great to see you explain your methodologies to do so.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:22:22
Excellent, have a good one!
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:24:39
There has yet to be any verifiably accurate data supplied which counters my point.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:25:57
That's an oversimplification unfortunately. For example, output consolidation by market participants can often be confused as 'change'.
Can you please explain your specific methodology for determining what is valid volume?
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:41:34
This unfortunately makes no sense as it is -- it'd be helpful if you could explain further.
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:41:05
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:26:40
It has been clearly explained multiple times. 
Feel free to ask any questions if you're unable to understand after reading through the comments.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:22:35
Honest question: did you read what you posted? There's not a single mention of use case differentiation in either research piece and the second mentions adjustments of over 20% from output consolidation ('change avoidance') alone. That's not to mention other potential use cases.
Output = spent is technically correct based on the link you provided. 
"Each input is in fact a reference to Satoshis that are the outputs of a previous transactions known as unspents."
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:22:04
It wasn't always $13 billion per day -- feel free to take a look at the charts in the link.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:28:13
This is transfer volume not trading volume.
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:31:00
This is transfer volume, not trading volume.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:34:46
Precisely, this is transfer volume not trading volume.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:09:57
There still hasn't yet been any verifiably accurate data provided to refute the original post.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:24:21
So you can't prove the number you want to be accurate, can't explain the number you've provided, and can't bother to think through why you're wrong.
Pardon me while I continue on my way.
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:21:14
It's a toss up between US treasury and USD depending trading pair in reference.
Other fiat is relatively illiquid. To quantify this a bit, USD is part of &gt;80% of all FX transactions according to the BIS.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:32:35
No worries but that's clear lol. How are you quantifying liquidity?
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:48:34
I asked how do you quantify liquidity, not qualify liquidity.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:31:27
Sir you're falling further and further into nonsense. I recommend looking into some mental health support.
Have a good one!
@_date: 2019-06-23 14:55:07
It's evident there is a lot of financial literacy education required in these parts. No worries though. 
Your conclusion is wrong because of the assumption of population and income being the input variables for GDP calculation. That is not valid logic and a straw man argument. 
For reference, there are hundreds of upvotes and tweets interactions that tell me I'm right. Feel free to keep complaining into the wind though!
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:32:00
You haven't explained your methodology, meanwhile I have explained mine.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:39:53
It may be helpful for you to learn some basic blockchain definitions before moving forward.
An output is part of a transaction "which contains two fields: a value field for transferring zero or more satoshis and a pubkey script for indicating what conditions must be fulfilled for those satoshis to be further spent."

Daily transfer volume = daily weighted price  * daily TX output volume

This is transfer volume not trading volume.

Appears to a misunderstanding, my bad!

US treasury is probably the most liquid asset on Earth, so bitcoin achieving 2% of its volume is actually worth celebrating.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:31:17
Except there was a fee paid for the transfers referenced in original post as well as one entity sending the transfer (bitcoin address A) and a different entity receiving the transfer (bitcoin address B), meanwhile there is no fee paid in your example and the same entity sending the cash (person A) and receiving the cash (person A).
You are unfortunately comparing apples and oranges.

Apologies but I can't take 'there is no valid volume' as a serious reprise.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:05:24
You have unfortunately digressed from partial nonsense to complete nonsense.
Have a good one.

The responses and data speaks for itself.

@_date: 2019-06-23 17:02:57
You just admitted I have the most accurate methodology since it's the only accurate methodology: to not differentiate between use cases.
No worries though, I'm glad to have had this opportunity to help you understand blockchain activity better.
