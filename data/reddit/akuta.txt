From what I can see from the little I have been made privy to it appears to be a pretty standard. I'm sure it's difficult to learn as an adult; however, I hear that the hard letters, wacky grammar, many words that sound phonetically the same but have different meanings (such as red and read, air and heir and their, there, and they're) and many words that are spelled the same but have different pronunciations and different meanings (as in read and read, one is to read and the other is a past tense for reading) make it one of the most difficult languages to learn as an adult.
Anyways, this is all off topic to the original post, but was very interesting to me nonetheless.

Gotcha. Completely understand. I've never learned a Germanic language outside of English (which seems to have thrown the masculine/feminine weight to words away for the most part), but the Latin languages I've learned are very similar in grammar to your description.

Why doesn't it work both ways? They show their woman-parts and if we like it they receive tips?

So in Czech, they add "ech" to make things plural?

Neither are worth money... Try cutting one out and selling it at a market cold. I find no need to be sexist either way, so no, neither are worth "money."


Knowing it and finding it acceptable are two different things.


Judging from your username (Reference to Japanese word, rather common among teens and early 20s), probably about 10 years older than you are. Maybe more.


Not that it's any of your business, but I've have many girlfriends. I've also been married. Are you also interested in my religious and political affiliations too?

I don't think that's much of a question... Because I'd be inclined to believe that he'd have pressed the other side to pay or be labeled a scammer.

+1 for math.
Though, their claim *is* still true... They'd have enough to buy a ticket to the $50,000 per plate fundraiser if they accumulated $500,000.
