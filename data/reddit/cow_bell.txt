Do not get into crypto yet if you can't maths very good.

How do you get back inside it?  Some 5th dimension shit right there.  Walk away and it gets closer and bigger.  Mind blown.

Why does Litecoin exist and the entire BTC corporation not suing it?

Please, with all of your negatively rated comments (I'm not a contributor to that by the way), reply as to how it is NOT a protocol.  You can't.  Maybe you're caught up in losing a bunch and want BTC to be at $20K (idiotically) again.  Who knows.  If you want a copycat, get on Charlie's ass.  Reading isn't very hard   [and this is just an example of how it came about](
It should be Bitcoin Lite but Charlie duped everyone with the name Litecoin and the coming "Lightning Network" because it makes it sound good.  And, so far, that's all it's done...sound like a good idea (to some, at least).  Explain how [this]( is not centralized.  Maybe I can't see straight, but that red, right in the middle, has some massive pull and will only continue to gain.
Roger's not the only person who pushes chains to try to keep BTC devs from making rash decisions that could inherently have huge negative effects in the future.  That's why there are other coins.  Bitcoin BTC will never be the only coin.
And constantly saying Bcash just shows that you hate Roger, not that you care for either coin, because it IS a Bitcoin.  Peek over the fence sometime and you'll see the grass is growing from the same ground.  It's about what a coin can do, not who's for it.  P2P Cash will win the battle in all of this, whichever coin that ends up being in 20 years.  As of now, Bitcoin's not even 10 years old so you may want to put a few eggs in other baskets.  Would hate to see anyone lose them all should something happen without diversification.

Good stuff ;)
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:28:05
This is more correct and what I was thinking.
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:37:30
Nope, afraid I'm not.  They're all protocols.

Since there was some cunt downvoting me, hopefully some people will get to see this since it'll probably be buried now.  I found the link for you.  Here it is.

Guys gain the ability to pack all the bullshit in a box and push it to the back of the brain to never be opened unless provoked to do so.  There's actually a funny-as-hell skit about the difference in the way men and women's brains store info somewhere out there in the internets.

Bad thing is he cock-blocked himself.

Looks like some kinda bacteria in a petri dish.
