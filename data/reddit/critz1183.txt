And its gone from 13k to under 9k, ya we have a dead cat bounce here. Horray ....
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:28:22
Only because he owns some. Also , “defies” ? Really, having a different opinion means you’re defiant now? Clickbait garbage
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:35:20
Not good
@_date: 2019-07-05 00:24:08
Fake news, it’s down 6% today
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:38:55
Paper wallets are free.
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:11:02
Do what once more? Lose 20% in a month?
@_date: 2019-07-23 03:56:25
Why not just wish for a million dollars to randomly show up at your door? About the same chance of it happening.
@_date: 2019-07-20 16:01:11
Buffet is right about bitcoin though.
@_date: 2019-11-20 18:57:09
If bitcoin has no use case, does an app for it have one?
@_date: 2019-11-11 02:26:56
Peter is right, making a meme about it doesn't make him wrong.
@_date: 2019-11-11 03:03:30
Irrelevant since it's not on Earth. May as well say there's $700 quintillion BTC up there.
@_date: 2019-11-07 03:26:02
McCafee see this chart and thinks it lacks ambition.  $1,000,000 by 2020 boys only 7 more weeks !

If you have a brokerage account you could buy GBTC, which is a fund ran by Grayscale that closely correlates with bitcoin. 
Shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust are eligible to be held in certain IRA, Roth IRA, and other brokerage and investor accounts.
Half of my bitcoin investing is through GBTC.
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:15:01
Buying a risky investment like bitcoin on credit isn’t the best idea ever.
@_date: 2019-08-06 02:28:25
It was, well see if it manages to get above the most recent high. If not then were in for more downside.
@_date: 2019-08-06 02:25:53
CNBC spends half the day talking about crypto.
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:56:16
Bad timing. Bitcoin getting throttled. Schiff is right though.
@_date: 2019-10-31 00:56:46
Banks don't rally deal in paper money now anyway. So no big deal there. This isn't 1980
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:12:15
Could be below 6k before the end of August
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:00:08
He probably got it wrong
@_date: 2019-08-11 22:17:06
Probably fades away to zero.
@_date: 2019-10-18 11:29:55
I think it's important to keep recent price drama in perspective.
@_date: 2019-08-13 21:16:42
LOL "the future of money" that goes down 5% in a day? No thanks.
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:12:34
@_date: 2019-06-10 03:33:03
Yep, I doubt that claim is actually true.
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:11:27
Its pegged to a basket of currencies from what ive heard.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:12:37
Who needs Bitcoin? We have Facebook coin now
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:16:36
Neither but how is that relevant?
@_date: 2019-06-15 01:46:03
How is he not in jail yet? Bitconnnnneeeeccctttttt ......
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:46:43
gotta wait a couple years for that
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:09:22
I see this more as a substitute/competitor to bitcoin. I don’t see libra as a positive for bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:31:07
Damn, gotta change it to 10k again.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:11:46
Unless he actually IS Satoshi!
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:10:04
But the Bruins lost ......
@_date: 2019-12-05 13:02:28
Not sure if joking tbh
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:13:11
Stage 1: National currencies &gt; Libra
Stage 2: Libra &gt; Bitcoin
Stage 3: Bitcoin &gt; Goods and services
Why not just skip the Libra and Bitcoin process.
@_date: 2019-12-05 12:39:54
How much money have you lost so far ?
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:30:02
That curve really flattens out. Looks like BTC wont ever get anywhere near 1 million or even 100k according to that chart.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:35:50
$10 , sweet! Time to load up!
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:43:07
7% fee is legal robbery lol
@_date: 2019-12-05 14:37:36
“At some point you never sell because there's nothing to sell it for.”
Because its worthless
@_date: 2019-12-05 12:40:45
So never sell then ? Just to be clear.
@_date: 2019-12-05 18:21:59
Tough one, not sure which will lose value more rapidly.
@_date: 2019-12-25 05:36:42
The 10% is probably the fee you pay to use the ATM.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:48:24
Logarithmic scale makes anything look possible. A little higher and it would be worth trillions.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:13:34
Everyone has a prediction, each more worthless than the next
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:08:04
Cloud mining is a total scam dont do it. Genesis, Hashflare all stole users money im sure there are others.
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:18:44
No idea who this is. Some sports star I'm guessing ?
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:17:50
Just a reminder not to panic, we've seen dips before.
@_date: 2019-09-28 12:50:41
This should move markets !
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:34:02
You could substitute "The U.S. dollar for Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:31:24
I hope so but I seriously doubt it.
@_date: 2019-09-27 11:23:58
I believe it made it as high as 
@_date: 2019-09-07 19:36:09
If we have a WW3 there won't be anyone left to care about bitcoin so ......
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:31:22
In before you lose your password
@_date: 2019-09-22 17:02:39
Damn and to think you could have just stayed at home and bought some on coinbase
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:25:18
You could always buy some GBTC at Ameritrade or whoever your broker is. I hold BTC and also some GBTC.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:19:02
If bitcoin goes to zero will they have articles saying man gets free pizza?
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:11:00
Gotta love Socialism !
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:36:16
In 10 years everyones gonna remember back when some jackass spent his bitcoin on a pencil.
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:29:33
Imagine a guy doing this not that many years ago where he bought bitcoin from an ATM @ $300 instead of $265. Just wait, you will be happy before too long.
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:53:45
With as many times as I've lost my phone I wouldn't consider that secure at all.
@_date: 2019-05-11 01:14:00
I hope so but this is the type of political sentiment that scares me.
