Should have called 'em 'uBits' and them we could very clearly tell people that using uBit for anything other than the micro- unit is wrong.
@_date: 2015-06-29 22:16:48
Why not uBits?

So, bitcoin isn't really that fungible, is it?
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:36:12
People don't think in terms of SI units, not in any country.  I'd be very confused if someone started talking in terms of decimetres or micrometres.  I didn't know how much a micro unit of something was until recently.
Metres, centimetres, millimetres are fine because I'm used to them.
Let's just stick with Bitcoin and uBits (microBitcoin).
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:39:17
Isn't it best to buy low?
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:25:47
That's depressing.  I wish they would adjust the emissions rate.  Miners don't need so many bitcoins as an incentive to mine right now, but they'll be needing them later.
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:26:33
Yup.  Let's call them uBits for short!
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:45:10
What are they up to?
@_date: 2014-11-13 12:31:58
Centcoin &amp; cents
Pencecoin &amp; pence
Eurocents &amp; cents
Bitcoin &amp; bits
Simple!  No-one will be confused!

Are the other alts as widely-accepted as Litecoin?  Can you trade them directly for USD?

Darkcoin has a higher market cap and trading volume.  I have nothing against Blackcoin, but I can only assume that the writer's intention was to write about Darkcoin.

Right.  There are no 'safe' paths in life anymore.  Keep your head down, do well in school, and all you'll have is lifetime debt and a soul-crushing job with no free time.  And you'll never be able to afford a family unless you take some financial risks of the kind you were hoping to avoid.

That's odd; I remember visiting supermarkets in the Netherlands in the medium-size city where I lived.  I remember at least 7 of them there.

Yes, but I don't know how to type the mu.
Let's call them uBits.

- It's fast -- a 64-second blocktime compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes.
- 1% or less yearly inflation.  Bitcoin's still being generated at a much higher rate.  So you might feel more comfortable holding onto your Blackcoin.
- New Blackcoins go to ordinary holders of coins (who stake), not miners.  Coin holders are probably less likely than miners to sell/dump.  Miners (e.g. Bitcoin miners) must sell coins, even at a loss, to recoup their massive expenses.
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:31:12
Despite those rules, the McShibe is now in the final (with the presenting Shibe having McWow as a backup name).
That said, OP's burger would probably have been better called the BitBurger.

Let's call them uBits.
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:12:41
I'm from the UK.  Both of those you marked as supermarkets clearly qualify as supermarkets.  The American one looks more like one of the newish out-of-town supermarkets that you'd need to drive to that have sprung up in the past decade or two.
And the convenience store pic you showed us looks like a convenience store or corner shop.  We have Spars in the UK too and that's what they are.  Hard to tell from the photo though.
@_date: 2014-09-22 04:26:18
With you on the units.  Not crazy about the 'bits' name.
Imagine if UK pennies were called 'pounds', and pounds called 'pound coins'.
@_date: 2014-11-05 09:19:22
Odd that it didn't tell me!  But have these instead :)

What is zerocoin/zerocash?  An addon for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:48:52
I agree that there are pointless copies of Bitcoin and Litecoin, and that these serve to damage the value of Bitcoins.  Currency's value is in its scarcity.
I don't agree with what you're saying about Darkcoin.  I understand that Darkcoin is going to be more anonymous than Bitcoin will be, even with the Darkwallet.
Anonymity is very important.  It's completely unacceptable to have all my transactions published all over the Internet and easily linked with me.
I see a year or two from now: Bitcoin being  because of network effects and advanced innovations like coloured coins, Darkcoin being  because of its anonymity, and no  strong competitors beyond that.
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:52:03

It's not like the choices are
a) donate to Sean's Outpost
b) burn the money
It could be more like:
a) donate to Sean's Outpost
b) donate to another charity
c) give some Bitcoins to disadvantaged people directly
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:49:49
This is why I hope Darkcoin becomes popular.  Coins need to be fungible.

- To buy other coins that are worth less than a bitcoin.
- Because it might be worth more in the future.
- Because the values are there down to the satoshi, whether you like that or not.
