You are so missing the point my friend... The original post is cherry picking too. It's comparing two radically different assets, ignoring most of what makes them different, and just assigning some kind of overarching value to them based on their USD value now as opposed to that arbitrary point in time.
People who are cherry picking the unfavourable dates are doing that to illustrate how dumb this post is.

No I'm not saying that... Nobody is, as far as I can tell. Seems like you're quite a few steps behind the actual debate here.

Yeah sure, why doesn't everyone just but a Ferrari already? Stupid plebs.

Alright then two years ago. Whenever the peak was. Thanks for your valuable contribution to the discussion

That was a first ballot hall of fame woosh right there. Even the /s couldn't stop him.

And if you invested $100 into Bitcoin 2 years ago, you have $50 now

Alright, I'll make one last attempt here... My friend, nobody - I repeat - nobody is trying to say that Bitcoin hasn't gone up in value since it was created. Gone up a lot, in fact. And yes, more than gold in that same period. It's simple math. We all see that. 
The debate here is about a post that says "fuck gold" because even though apparently it went 5x in that same time frame, it's not as much of an increase as Bitcoin. 
This is an idiotic stance, because it ignores countless other factors that would be crucial to assessing gold vs Bitcoin as assets / investments. Many of those factors have been stated by myself or others in this thread so I won't repeat then again.  But honestly, if you still don't understand what the debate is by now, I don't know what else to tell you. You're not helping anyone by explaining that two plus two does in fact equal four.

Yes, there are only a few short windows where you could have bought, held until today, and still have BTC but be at a loss.
There are also literally countless dates where you could have bought it, sold at some later date, and be at a loss, so Im not sure what your point is.
Of course cherry picking goes both ways. Thats kinda the whole point I, and many others, are making in this thread.

The irony of your comment... Let me know when you get there.

This completely missed the point. I could point to a winning lottery ticket and say "hey, this was bought for $2 and won $2 million. Take that, gold!"
Again, cherry picking a specific point in time, comparing returns from that point in time, and using it as an argument for bitcoin over gold, is idiotic.

That's the point isn't it. This post is moronic because it's sniping a point in time and assigning some overall value to an asset based on today vs that one particular point in time. There are dozens of points in time you could pick that make it look great. There are also dozens you could pick that make it look like a complete joke. Gold, by contrast, is vastly more stable and proven, and has more or less been steadily increasing for a long time. 
Doesn't mean gold is always going to be superior or that there's no place for bitcoin. But it does mean that this post, and everyone defending it, is  really ignorant (or dishonest) about currency and economics more generally .
@_date: 2019-10-19 20:25:44
Nobody is denying that Bitcoin is up in value overall. That is self evident. That has nothing to do with why this is a dumb post
@_date: 2019-10-20 23:05:59
Seems like you need to take a deep breath.
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:39:41
Y'all aren't doing your cause any favours by posting stuff this dumb
@_date: 2019-10-22 18:32:58
But this analysis ignores the huge volatility or Bitcoin compares to gold. It's easy to say "hey just buy Bitcoin and hold forever, you'd be up by now!" But the reality for most people is not that simple. When the thing takes a nosedive, a lot of people, understandably, sell at a loss in fear that it's going to go to zero and collapse entirely. With gold, while it certainly has its ups and downs, nobody is fearing it will go to zero

Or they are sick of hearing about how it's the future and getting daily price updates from some dipshit at their office who has no clue what he's talking about.
