I had a job interview with MtGox a couple of weeks ago for a frontend developer position. After talking about their technical environment I declined the position. Contemplated publicizing my story, but I have zero proof that the interview took place. But fuck me is their environment fucked up.
Either way, I have been recommending to my friends to move any BTC away from Gox as soon as possible, and regret not bringing this advice into the open. I'm a Tokyoite, so if you want to talk to me about the job Interview, or just drink a beer, send me a DM.

This card has been sent by the Tokyo district court, not Mt.Gox.

People get greedy, overconfident, develop a "what can happen" attitude. Well, they've learnt a valuable lesson today.

It's a Japanese thing. "There is no excuse, I think". Guy was scared shitless.

Maybe, just maybe, because you're being trolled.

No man, it's FUD!
edit: actually this is caused by an error in the HTTP protocol. MtGox is working on resolving the issue.
edit2: y'all mad or something?

Honestly I don't know. It could very well be that they're using a content distribution network to serve static pages from several locations. I think the leaked source code has some hard coded IP addresses in there that manage transactions. Looking up who owns those addresses will show you more (but still inconclusive) data on where the servers are located.

I don't know if the call center is government appointed or not, but that aside: Mark might be an idiot, his legal team is not. The staff is working for Tibanne K.K. A separate entity from Mt. Gox K.K.
Mt. Gox goes bankrupt/files for bankruptcy protection, but the parent company lives on. Mark might have created a scheme where Mt. Gox funnels funds to Tibanne via a licensing model. For example, Tibanne could be licensing a bitcoin trading engine to Mt. Gox for X% of the revenue.
MtGox dies, Tibanne lives on.

With Gox being a Japanese company I don't think this will change much.

I did not. But I still don't feel comfortable talking about it. That said, something is seriously wrong at MtGox, and you deserve to know about this.

Would this van have to be driven to a location every day?
Edit: asking because I have a JP license, but not enough time to drive a location from and to location X every day.

Not all that different from what the site looks like now. The circle is complete!

I was told that up until a few weeks [at time of the interview] ago, there was hardly any development environment to test changes. Most changes were done straight on the production environment. Typing this made me throw up in my mouth.
The guy who interviewed me was very friendly, but I felt like a psychiatrist more than a job candidate. The dude went on about how shitty the atmosphere is at the offices, and what he told me about Mark seems to be spot on from what OP has said.
Interview guy, if you read this, sorry yo.

That's nonsense. They kill themselves in Aokigahara, the suicide forests surrounding Mount Fuji!

Tibanne K.K. is also owned by Mark.

Take your pick.

Because Gox was an exchange, not a bank.

I have one. Applied for a position as developer around Q4 2013. 
The entire codebase was stored in a database, only accessible via a client Mark maintained, with no version control nor lock controls meaning if we both had a file open we could overwrite one another's files and undo work.
There was no pre-production environment. Meaning changes were supposedly deployed untested or made straight on production. 
I was told I could not touch the backend, although they were working on getting access to this via Mark. Although it was taking time because Mark was more busy with his Bitcoin cafe. 
They said that despite all this, it was still a decent place to work because there was literally no pressure to perform. 
I'm glad I didn't take the offer.
