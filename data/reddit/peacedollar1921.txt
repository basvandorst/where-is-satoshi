Not sure why I went two different ways on that.  I remember some kind of an issue at the time. Thanks.

Sweep the BTC from your paper wallet. Then download the Electron Cash wallet to you PC. Import the private key to Electron and an identical amount of bcash will be there.  You can then import the same private key into Coinomi to claim you Bitcoin Gold. 
Enjoy. Peace.

Isn't BTC a currency?  So what if it goes up and I can buy more with it.  When the dollar goes up and I can buy more with it, I'm not taxed on that.  Let's hope cryptos can finally help eliminate a century of government theft.

I truly hope you're right.  I own coins.  But no one is spending, which is what we're supposed to do with a "currency".  We're just hoarding essentially a security with no intrinsic value.  When the first large addresses start to cash out ....yikes.

Spend...spend...spend!  No merchants...no currency.  Not even $1,000 is sustainable if we treat BTC as a security to hold.

Your second paragraph says it all.

How long have we known about the 2020 halving?  That's not already factored into the price?  Really?

Everyone on here...and everywhere else,  talks about what their bitcoin are worth...in DOLLARS.   I own coins because I believe in them so don't take this as an argument, just a hope that we start treating it like a currency now. Waiting for $100k or any other number before doing so risks a swift loss of confidence and crash.

You sold into a bubble, you'll realize over time how smart you were, especially for the reason you did it.  I'm still holding mine, and hoping I won't regret it.  Good luck.

Until we see $19k again....it's a bubble.

Can I ask what are "reasonable rates"?
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:22:33
Way lower than other ones I've heard of.  Thanks.

There's nothing better than seeing the shorts get spanked hard.  Any security, any currency, any time.  Eff them all.

I own cryptos too ....but you and everyone else knows banks will be here in 15 years. Please do some diversifying friend.  Peace.

Take politics and crypto out of the debate and you still have a life sentence with no possibility of parole for a non violent offender.  Zero chance to redeem or contribute to society even as an old man. Disgraceful.  The judge should be disbarred and put on trial herself.  In the time it took me to type this, how many murderers and child abusers were paroled?
@_date: 2018-07-20 02:03:52
Don't care if you're a libertarian or not, or what your thoughts are on crypto. But life without parole for a website-operating,  non violent offender is a disgrace.  Murderers do 8 years and then kill again. Legal system is a laughingstock.  The judge should be disbarred and placed on trial.

The day of BTC going from a speculative commodity to actual accepted currency is nearing. You'll think $2,400 was a steal when that time comes.  KEEP BUYING. $20,000 is a conservative estimate in 5 years.

Didnt realize he was tried or convicted of that.  Because he wasn't.

85+ year old guy worth $50 billion is afraid of BTC?   Give me a f'n break.
