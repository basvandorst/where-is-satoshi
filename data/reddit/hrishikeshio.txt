MMM has started collapsing. We will see a significant drop in Bitcoin price. But the negative publicity for Bitcoin in media will do us no good.

Not sure what you are talking about, I have made paper backups of my wallet and shared it with 3 of my devices without issues. They have a 12 word mnemonic backup support.

Thanks. I did not do anything special. Used electrum wallet.
@_date: 2016-01-18 12:37:37
Was it a multisig wallet? How did you import it? Using words, file or something else?

Wow that makes sense. So to spam 1 satoshi a million times, I need 1 million private keys with 1 satoshi in them in the first place, which is difficult to get. If all my Btc are In a single private key, then attack is not possible. Is that correct?
Now this raises another concern, if I have 100 Btc and make a micro transaction of 0.1 Btc. That means this creates a transaction of 100 Btc output with 1 satoshi fee. Now, since the fees are too low, this transaction will be stuck in mempools for a long time. Does this mean my 99.9 Btc are also not spendable from old address since it will be considered a double spend attack? And it can't be spent from new  (change) address since the transaction isn't confirmed yet?

Circle only accepts US debut and credit cards currently.
@_date: 2016-01-12 07:03:15
But these never disappear and stay in mempool indefinitely

Copay servers are open source and anyone can run them. You can connect to alternative servers or run your own.

I am convinced this is a scam and spam. Have seen the same comment in many threads.

Welcome. Can you remove "Paypal parody commercial" from the vimeo video title? I want to share it on facebook. My friends haven't seen the paypal video and will get confused by the word "parody" and think this is a joke.
