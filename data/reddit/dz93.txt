Bitcoin won't recover. A decentralized currency has to work from the start. No one can make changes later on because not everyone will agree. No one will ever agree on this. People just need to accept that bitcoin is a toy and only a toy.

Thanks for letting us know. Any other personal issues you'd like to share?
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:08:06
Bitcoin can't last like this. It won't be long before bitcoin dies off completely. As soon as that does cue centralized government digital currency. No more decentralization for anyone because we couldn't make it work in the first place.

He'll ask everyone why we destroyed his cryptocurrency 
@_date: 2015-12-21 15:25:19
He uses 1.6GH USB miners for $50 a piece. The article also talks about the amazing 3000GH miner for the small price of $10,000. I then checked the date on the article. It all makes sense now. Good job OP, you're over a year late on this news.

So why are there some people who think the block size limit shouldn't be increased?
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:42:47
No doubt it will be interesting to watch. I guess I just couldn't see anyone coming to an agreement and if there was it would have to be agreed by a large majority. Basically, someone will have to have enough pull or enough people backing them in order to get their change to go through. But what if that change turns out to be a bad decision and have unintended consequences that could cripple bitcoin? Do you see this as a possible issue or is it a complete non issue no matter what? And of course how will we deal with security issues?
I'm trying to get a good idea about whether bitcoin will survive and be used in the future or if the government or some other agency will step in with a centralized digital currency that everyone will switch to instead. I hope to god its the former but it seems like the latter is also highly probable. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:50:14
The system might end badly but I don't think anything will ever happen to the people who run it. Those people almost always get away freely with no consequence for their actions. 
Do you think the federal reserve is a system that we would want to stick around or not?
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:07:17
So then how will anything ever be changed? And if it were to change how will we prevent security from becoming an issue? And how will other agree on that fix? It seems like this is a never ending battle where everyone has an idea about how bitcoin could be improved but it'll never get implemented because no one will ever agree to it. It seems like this could be the death of bitcoin. 
And of course I don't know enough about the technical issues to make a statement but I think, in this case, I don't need to know a lot about the technical details about bitcoin to understand how uncooperative humans are which will make improving a decentralized currency a hard or even impossible task to do. 
Also who will be in change of making the changes, how will it be implemented, what happens when the other 49% don't agree, etc? There's a lot of questions to be asked so its hard for me to see any changes happening within the next few years. 
From what I can see, in order for a digital, decentralized, currency to work, it has to be flawless from the start.
@_date: 2015-05-27 16:19:22
I hope so
@_date: 2015-05-27 15:56:55
You're very right and its hard for me to understand your view on things but with technology evolving as fast as it is, all the best technology is only affordable by the privileged, what happens when that technology is used to suppress any future revolutions or any attempt at dismantling a toxic system that only serves to benefit the people running it? If we can learn from history then so can the privileged so what's stopping them from stopping us from stopping them? If that makes sense lol. 
In other words, the majority usually has the most power or pull behind them. But what happens when numbers no longer matter and technology is the big determining factor in whether a certain movement wins or not. Whoever has the most powerful technology will win and as I've stated before the best technology is usually kept in the hands of those who can afford it. 
Btw, this is just a casual conversation about what if's. I'm not trying to argue or prove any point. Just feel like discussing views and opinions with people.

They've definitely got my support. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:03:05
So there is currently a solution that's already being implemented? How and when will other know about this solution and that they'll need to implement it as well. Will it be just downloading an updated client? Or what needs to be changed for this solution to take effect?
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:24:24
Try scrypt based coin instead

And nothing will ever be done about it and the banks will always get away with murder. What's new? That's just how life is and we have to accept it. Some people just get to be more privileged than others. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 14:19:07
I'm sorry if I'm a little uneducated about the subject here but what is the issue? Why is everyone trying to come up with a new way to do something in bitcoin? What's wrong with bitcoin now that needs to be changed?

Try circle

This is on r/bitcoin, of course your comments are being shadow deleted. Don't post anything here anymore. Its a highly censored subreddit. 
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:48:15
I have to use circle. Its the fastest, easiest and one of the only options available for me to buy bitcoin. But as soon as I buy them I immediately send them to my wallet. 
Believe me, if there was a better alternative I'd use it. 
@_date: 2015-08-11 22:12:47
Could you explain how this is better than QR codes?
@_date: 2015-08-10 14:35:08
Its entertaining yet slightly saddening to see people like that who severely lack any form of critical thinking. This guy just picks a side based on what resonates with him the most. Regardless of whether his website can be generally viewed as extreme. 
You would think that a website advocating against government corruption (or any other form of corruption or issues) would want to teach their users to dissect information on their own and come to a logical conclusion to find the truth behind all the bias. But nope. Almost all "alternative media" sources use the same tricks and tactics as "mainstream media" to get their users to conform to their views. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:42:23
This is nothing new. You'll have this with any currency. It will never change.

Yeah I saw that. Thanks. I'll check them out. Btw, I'm not doing anything that could be considered as money laundering am I? Lol. All I'm doing is buying bitcoins on circle, converting some to litecoin, and then I'll probably trade bitcoin every so often on bitstamp. The amount of money I'll be dealing with will always be bellow $1000. I shouldn't have anything to concerned about should I? I want to make sure I'm doing things appropriately and legally.

... You would never be allowed in America again without paying what you owe or doing time. And why the hell would you even want USD if you already left the country. Your question is so stupid and your logic behind it is so flawed that I can only come to the reasonable conclusion that you are trolling. You can't possibly be serious about any of this. I just can't accept that. I can't allow myself to believe that someone on this planet is as far gone as you make yourself appear to be.

Your first mistake is thinking that you can get away freely without paying back the money you owe. It doesn't matter if you don't even own a single dollar. They will take anything and everything from you until they get their money back. You're a fool to think otherwise. Bitcoin won't save you from collection agencies...

You are so far off track with everything you've said here. It makes me wonder if you truly know what you're talking about. I understand that you THINK you know what you're talking about but clearly you don't. I also understand that you are one of those people who will never admit that they're wrong and that you'll go throughout life always thinking, "Damn, those people on reddit are so stupid; They don't even know how rich they could be if they listened to me". So to each, his own. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:42:49
Yes this would be a very nice feature to add. It would make buying things with bitcoin so much easier for everyone. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:57:21
.. If I was laundering money I wouldn't have given all these websites my personal info and pictures of my drivers license... No, I can't use Cex.io so there isn't a simple way for me to buy litecoin. I'd like to hold both bitcoin and litecoin but I'm probably just going to be buying $20 - $50 worth of coins per week. I figure circle is easy to get bitcoin so now all I need to do is either send my coins to cex and convert or maybe there's a different way. I can use Cex to convert, I just can't buy from Cex. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 11:47:53
Very well thought out argument. Clear and concise. You sir, are a genius.
@_date: 2015-07-27 12:01:42
I'm in a small town. I'm probably the only one who uses bitcoin. I'll definitely look into that but I was hoping for an online exchange that would allow me to purchase via debit or credit card or even set up a bank account online that would allow the funds to be taken out automatically. Currently I have to go into my bank and set up the transfer. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 15:04:19
Circle worked perfect. Thank you
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:26:03
So you're idea is that when you spend bitcoins using your wallet it'll automatically buy the equal amount of bitcoins you just spent and add that back into your wallet. So you're basically at a constant balance no matter what?
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:55:35
So when a bitcoin is lost, its gone forever. Never to be used again? What would happen if, over time, millions of bitcoins ended up in purgatory? Does that mean that the total available amount of bitcoins in circulation would drop? Is this good in the end?
