Good bot!
A grammar Nazi bot, but a good bot nonetheless.  Gave me a chuckle!

Every incentive?  Considering that bitcoin is the most popular crypto on the market and they charge a fee for buying and selling it, I think that statement is a bit of a hard stretch. 
Let's think about this.  We're asking Coinbase to implement something in a hurry, which, let's be honest. If I was CEO, I wouldn't do it immediately either.  There are  LOT of factors to take into consideration and lot of testing that has to be done if they want to maintain the security of their system and not expose any issues that would compromise their system.   Because, let's face it. Mt. Gox was bad, but we have much bigger exchanges now than then, and if something drastic were to happen due to unforeseen circumstances to one of them, it would be bad for the whole crypto community.

When you're in control of funds for so many people, and no FDIC insurance, I believe caution should be thrown to the wind as much as possible in these situations.  No matter how easy it may seem.   I have no problem with them taking their time to make sure that every avenue and potential hole is accounted for during such an implementation.

Well, that's not the impression that has given, primarily of the statements that it's an 'altcoin' and doesn't belong in the bitcoin subreddit. 
And if that's not the case, then Theymos and the rest of the mod team have not done a great job of being clear on that communication. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:47:01


Which brings me to another point in this subreddit.  This has happened to me before on non core related discussions on here as well.  And that's the fact that a lot of people here in this subreddit are rather quick to try and label someone negatively or respond with negative comments just because they don't agree with the poster.  Now, don't get me wrong, that's a problem with forums in general, especially Reddit, but there seems to be a higher than normal concentration of that in this particular group, which is another factor when it comes to how it's been viewed in a negative light by the bitcoin community and enthusiasts. 
In other words, to outsiders, we seem to be a group of nerds pissed off at each other and tossing insults and labels rather than focusing on discussing the technology that has the potential to change the financial world.  And then we wonder why noone takes us seriously. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 19:24:42


Actually, my statement was based upon what was said by the mods calling it an altcoin and therefore not belonging on I had found this annoying because I didn't know much about XT, but as someone who at the time, was holding 29 bitcoins, was VERY concerned about what was going on as far as proposals, and I have to admit, I myself, even as a lurker, became angry when I saw those discussions nixed, whereas proposals by the main developers were still allowed, even though we didn't have any existing code or much information from the core developer's proposed solution. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:22:36
Let me give a good scenario that might shed a bit of light on how many people in this subreddit feel about the current state of the core software and the leadership behind it. 
Let's assume that we have a classroom.  Full of students, and there is a teacher leading the discussion and instructing the students.   Let's say that the current discussion is math.  
While the teacher is discussing a particular math formula, one of the students, one who is seemingly bright stands up and proposes a better solution to the problem being discussed by the teacher.  But instead of listening to the student, the teacher kicks the student out of the class.  What situation does this create? 
Well, this situation wasn't just between the student and the teacher, but the entire class, because the rest of the students were observing this situation.   And so now, an alternative solution has been proposed, but the person proposing that solution has been disbarred from the classroom before all of the details of that solution can be presented.   And as a result, the confidence in the current solution has been undermined, for the teacher's solution not been tested against alternative methods.  And on top of that, there is also frustration towards the leadership in the classroom due to the way the situation was handled and dismissed without due process and adequate discussion, which has now painted the teacher in a negative and tyrannic light.

This is really an unrealistic suggestion when you consider how many installations of windows are out there and what the average user uses. 
People are going to use Windows or Apple operating systems when it comes to mainstream computing.   And even if they didn't and we all went linux, there would still be targeting and hacks of this sort.  
Personally, I use a hardware wallet, and I do not keep my hardware  keys nor the seed anywhere on my pc
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:51:35
Well, let me mention this from mainly a lurker's standpoint. 
I currently own bitcoin and I'm very interested in the technology behind it.  And I'm ALWAYS reading up on the latest happenings and enhancements to bitcoin and blockchain technology. 
I have been frustrated behind the banning of topics behind the new proposals, because let's be honest, they are proposed enhancements to the current version of bitcoin, which as we all know, has problems that need to be addressed when it comes to scalability. 
And I find it frustrating when proposed solutions that are not provided by a particular group within the a group of certain bitcoin developers is outright banned.   Because it might be a good solution, it might be bad, but many people will never know because the proposition hasn't been adequately given enough time for enough explanation before being outright banned from this forum.    This is not only frustrating, but it undermines the trust of many of us who are watching when it comes to the leadership and ESPECIALLY the solidness of the bitcoin technology itself. 
If bitcoin, the current blockchain, the main developers, and the current core software are as solid as they should be, then there should be no reason to worry or ban particular alternative discussions, because over time,  those alternative solutions will be proven inferior or inadequate in comparison to the current or proposed core by the main developers.  And then we all go on with our business and move along to the next big discussions on bitcoin. 
But that is not happening, and because these topics, and people were banned due to this alternative discussion, we are currently stuck on this particular hump in bitcoin development and are also not only worried about whether things are being hidden, given preferential treatment, etc... we are also worried about the value of our money that we have thrown into the bitcoin economy.   And people who are thinking about throwing money into the bitcoin economy are thrown off by all of these negative discussions and lack of professionalism when it comes to the discussions as far as the future of bitcoin.

I suggest you work in tech support with the average user for a year and then come back and say this.   And while you're at it, convince the majority of corporations and businesses to roll out Linux to the desktops of all of their users.  
I wish you were right though, I really do hehe. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 03:01:22
Ah, looks like I got some more reading and research to do on the limitation of bitcoin.  Thank you!
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:51:17
To the negative responses, I say this. 
1.  We've already seen some high transaction fees.  Hell, the whole reason for all of this fighting over the past few years, has been over the blocksize limit and bottlenecks accompanied by fees. 
2. Cryptocurrency already is daunting enough for some.  And then to add another layer on top of it to learn is a big turnoff for many.  We can talk about capabilities all day long, but if it's not easy to learn and convenient for the end user, and at the same time intimidating, people aren't just going to use it. 
And for god's sake, let's please stop with the toxic comments anytime anyone says anything that goes against the hive mind thinking of the people in this reddit and have an actual discussion.

True, but Hearn wasn't the only problem.  That's just the latest icing on the cake.  The bitcoin community has been, and continues to be, very negative when it comes to discussions, no matter what the subject is. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:51:34


People said the same thing about the internet when the only access was through BBS's and using the lync browser.  That it was only a geek thing.  Same thing about online commerce.  And look where we are now. 
Some people see the potential, and some can't.

So do Bitcoin Devs
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:40:15
At a time where bitcoin has overcome the stigma of 'Only criminals use it', and has gotten into the crosshairs of major banks, venture capitalists, and established companies, it is still riddled with the bickering and the fighting of the developers, which causes many major players and users to back off.    
And not to mention the rampant censorship, and often negative environment of the bitcoin community as a whole.

Much, much deeper than that. I didn't appreciate it until I took a look at it from a mathmatical sense. Number of addresses, irreversable rotational math to generate public addresses, etc... The items you mentioned are pretty basic. 
I'm pretty amazed at how r/bitcoin has gotten so emotionally caustic lately. I'm seeing that first hand.

@_date: 2015-08-25 21:41:24


The concepts and methods, yes.  Down to the formula's that would be a resounding no. 
But the point is this.  I know enough about it now to overcome my skeptical thoughts.  And I think about new skeptical ideas frequently, which cause me to do even more research and learn more.  Some I understand, and others, no.  
I am deeply honored that you're dedicating so much time to me though.  Never thought that me and my ideas would occupy your mind this this period of time and keep you bothered for this long.  :)
@_date: 2015-08-21 05:56:38
Well, I gave an upvote.  I think it's a valid question.  Obviously, mods included, there's been a lot of butthurt on this subreddit recently. 
Well, more than there usually is.

That's awesome.  I don't know the average person would be able to comprehend that though.

I'm making the argument that it's good.  If you're countering the argument, then present your evidence.  I've presented mine.  If anything, let's make this a good discussion rather than skepticism and negativity.

The main reasons are for transparency, accountability, and for showcasing Bitcoin's ability to quickly move funds.
When I invisioned it, I envisioned it as a 'pool' of funds that people just generally contribute to at times. With no particular cause in mind.   And then the community suggests and votes that a portion of the pool is donated to a particular cause when it makes the ranks of the front page or social media. 
For obvious reasons, I'm reluctant for people in need to make suggestions on why they in particular would need the donation.  Too much begging, sob scam stories, etc...   The donation group would actually make the first step, after determining that it's a suitable cause to donate to, to make initial contact and spell out the requirements for such a thing to happen.  Verification of the recipient, possibly making sure that they have an account with coinbase, etc...   Things to make sure that anybody showing generosity by donating to a pool of bitcoin to be used for donations isn't having their money being taken care of. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:07:48
I'm kind of wondering if some of this is intentional by those who are proposing the higher block sizes, or just plain popularity gain

You've given me something else to investigate and research now. As far as these hardware wallets, what is a recommended brand, and on top of that, what are the consequences of storing these on my personal device. I ask because various friends of mine sre oaying attention to my actions and ask lots of questions. Just as I am learning, they are also learning from me. At some point, I may make a video on my channel soon to help others from a technical beginner standpoint.
@_date: 2015-07-31 18:20:23
What is the deal with this, anyway.  I'm sort of new and I'm boggled by this.  What exactly was done for this site to be able to do this, and would it even remotely have an effect on already established wallets, and why or why not?

As far as the reasons on why we should vs why we shouldn't, what ar the main reasons for the core developers to want it to stay the way it is?   Wanting to avoid a fork?  Security reasons?   Transaction fees? etc...

Decision was made as I was posting it.   I'll come back when this subreddit becomes a lot more open to discussion and less inflammatory towards each other.   If that happens.  I still plan on being deeply involved in bitcoin discussions, but from what I've seen (and felt) in the past few weeks, it can't happen here the way things are. 
I wish the best to all here though.
