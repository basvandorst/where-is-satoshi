BIP38 is very good and you don't even need a strong password for it to be effective.

No, no moon from ether.  It will probably go down since Bitcoin will be one of the main on ramps/off ramps.

You seriously think your holdings are going to magically double in value if there is a fork?
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:59:27
Pure incompetence on your part.  Make educated decisions!

You obviously did zero research before you threw money at coinbase.  Most of us around here are also coinbase customers so we know what's up.

I only have to wait because I have decided to.  If I wanted instant transactions I would verify further.  You would know this if you did your homework.

No you do not because BIP38 and Brain Wallets are not the same thing.  Go learn about BIP38.

Manifestos don't mean shit.

I don't verify further because it gives me time to notice if my account has been compromised and someone's trying to buy and move coins.  I don't keep coins there for anyone to steal.

There is nothing mysterious about violating FCC regulations.

I disagree about Ethereum because it was funded using Bitcoin and is an excellent example of how a project can be funded using our currency.

The reward is your ability to have a say in the direction of the network.  The more nodes you run the bigger your voice.

WTF, Wences did not introduce Bitcoin to Silicon Valley.

Those aren't tiny joke forums.  Their threads are on the front page every single day.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:24:24
It's important to note that they are doing this on their own ethereum not Frontier.

Then maybe you should leave until you need some Bitcoin support.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:50:16
I don't agree, it does nothing to help Bitcoin if it's centralized and private.

If I help you, are you going to use this knowledge to break the law?
