Which is why many argue that is impossible to value BTC since it has no foreseeable income streams from investing like stocks do. Just like fiat, BTC has no intrinsic value regardless of what "experts" will make you think.

1. Fees. Currently are high and even though developers work on it, if they don’t fix it soon enough that will cause problems.
2. Competition. Financial institutions are very powerful, if they start feeling threatened by cryptocurrencies they have many ways of sabotaging it.
3. Regulation. A minimum amount of regulation in my opinion is not only good, but also essential. Too much regulation though could hurt crypto.
4. Speculation. It’s what cause high volatility and market crashes, pretty self explanatory.
5. Taxation. If government introduce taxation specifically designed for crypto that taxes gains at higher rates than other assets, that will pretty much be the death of Bitcoin.

In finance, we look more at % movements rather than dollar amount. Using the Future value formula for a 365 x 2 years period, with a present value of $10,000 and a daily increase of 0.0635% you get just over $1,000,000 in 2 years.
Meaning a daily increase of 0.635% is enough to result in Bitcoin worth $1,000,000 in two years from today. 
This obviously makes 2 extreme assumptions, first that bitcoin will keep rising, second that there is enough money to put into bitcoin that will result in 0.0635% movements even when its market cap is in the trillions.

FYI what he is saying is not that there is no bubble, but the ways available to short the existing bubble aren't efficient. 
For example, futures work with margin, if someone decides to short bitcoin long term, it is possible that he will get margin calls way before the price crashes due to high upwards volatility, resulting in either losing the money he shorted or putting even more money to keep his positions open. 
Certain options do not require margin, the only thing you are paying for is the premium and that is the only thing you can lose, no more no less.

BTC is not a regulated security in the USA, therefore insider trading laws don't apply. Unless they stole your money, or their service failed/glitched and you lost your funds, you cannot sue them for losing money from trading.

The post is flawed, now arguments there. But the core idea is correct overall 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:44:42
I work at an accounting firm in Sydney, clients literally call us every few days asking about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:40:33
Alright, let's think about it.
Let's say you live in Europe, that is because that is where I am from, but it can happen in any country.
You buy Bitcoin at $10,000 on 3/12/2017.
On 30/6/2018 Your investment is worth $20,000.
The government announces the same day that due to the nature of cryptocurrencies being unregulated, they will tax the capital gain at a higher rate of 40% for gains realised after 30/12/2018, which is in six months. 
That means, that with your current gains of $10,000, you will have to pay $4,000 in tax if you sell after 30/12/2018, OR you could sell earlier and pay a much lower tax.
The thing is, this is what literally anyone with half a brain would do, as a result the price will plummet because people will be realising gains prior to the application of the new taxation rules. Even if you decide to hold, your gains will decrease since the price is plummeting, and many would sell to avoid losses. 
At this point, very few will have open positions in Bitcoin, and the investment is not attractive enough for the big pockets anymore because is taxed at higher rates, and since the big pockets are the ones who actually move the price, the smaller investors will see almost no gains. Since Bitcoin is more an asset than it is means of exchange, there is no point putting your money in it if you will not get enough returns.

I was thinking about Metcalfe’s law recently and you can see the correlation between the f(x)=x^2 and the price graph of bitcoin which it makes me think it applies very well, at least for now. 
I still though do not think the accelerated price increases will last for too long. In fact it is better for the health of bitcoin if it become less volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:43:37
NO. I strongly believe crypto will be big on institutional but with the current high transaction fees and clunkiness could never be used on a daily basis.

Well clearly an economy would be in trouble during the scenario you describing, but one-way government could stimulate growth again is by creating more debt. (Look at GFC bailout of the banks or Greece's debt crisis)
It is sort of a never-ending cycle at this point. Although I am pretty sure if we try, we could find a better alternative today since technology and knowledge are much more developed than when this system was put in place.

This is extremely inaccurate. Nothing can surpass the credit bubble of 2008. I don’t know what metrics they used to make those graphs but they are way off. They are using multiple of price to estimate the size of the bubble, not the actual size of the capital invested in the bubble which is what really you should be looking at if you want to know what damage a bubble can cause.

You just confirmed the pattern I noticed. Bitcoin rallies up to 150% with some ups and downs, then the price corrects by around 35% and then it rallies again for about another 150%. I've been studying this pattern for the last 2 years and I can say it is valid.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:51:01
You can see futures as to what the market believes the underlying spot price of the asset will be when the contract expires. But because that is only an estimate, not what the actual price is going to be, people use the difference to profit. 
That is the simplest explanation i can give.

No arguments there. But it still illogical.
Think about it, if everyone suddenly were to own bitcoin and use it to transact, if it’s price kept going up the prices overall would go up as well, simply because there would be more available money that increases in value chasing after the same goods, even if the supply of bitcoin stays the same. 
Even gold has appreciated over the years and not just because the dollar lost its value against it.

It has some but very little application to finance.

I have noticed that the transaction costs have been increasing. And to be honest this will hold back Bitcoin and any other crypto from becoming an everyday currency to use. It is great for international transactions, but it will never be good enough for a person to go and buy something from a store if that will cost him a fee to get it (even if its small) when he can just use cash instead.
@_date: 2018-10-19 02:30:06
If you mathematically look at pure correlation of main stock indexes like US and bitcoin, there is actually high correlation during times of volatility, eg over the past two years we had two noticeable stock market corrections and both times bitcoin experienced high volatility during those days. Your theory make no sense if you look into real numbers, bitcoin has been and still is a speculative asset and people tend to sell those assets firstly when things look gloomy. That been said, really significant market crashes have unpredictable outcomes.

I read the thing, it is a good read but makes some assumptions such as the fact that labor available will decrease therefore causing an increase in wages that in turn will result in higher inflation making fiat currency weaker. The whole idea is very correct, but that is IF labor market actually decreases. He does not seem to take into account the fact that technology very likely will take over a numerous amount of jobs thus making wages cheaper.

Logically speaking the higher the market cap get the lower impact a transaction of average size should have. 100bil market might sound large but it’s nothing compared to the total money in circulation for you average currency. Looking Bitcoin growth as a company is wrong. Company’s do move on large percentages 3-4% sometimes on a daily basis. Whilst currencies even though they are far more traded than stocks they only move 0.5-1% due to the large money in circulation. If you think about it logically, right now there’s 12 mil average bitcoin traded that is 0.012% of the current bitcoin market cap. It is more than enough to have a sizeable impact on its movement. But when the market cap is larger m ( even though the daily volume will increase proportionally) its % will be far lower and to little to cause an impact. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:33:14
OK this is going to get a bit philosophical and very economics based rather than blockhain based, but here it is:
The foundation of most economic systems out there relies on development through competition, a system supported by the idea of capitalism. The problem is, in the long run under this system the one who has the biggest capital will prevail, even during times of innovation. After all, innovation can be bought, it can be expensive sometimes, but it can be bought. 
How does that relate to Bitcoin and mining?
It is simple, initially buying, selling and mining bitcoin was cheap. Through the innovative ideas of blockchain materialized through bitcoin, it was possible for a 15-year-old to mine bitcoin in his parent's garage. 
That is obviously not the case anymore. As mining became more difficult and substantially more expensive, only those that could afford to either mine for lower profits, or invest money to relocate to countries with cheaper electricity etc. were able to remain active miners.
As a result, like it or not mining was limited to mostly economic factors to select few that had the capital and the knowledge to remain active. At this point the entry level for mining Bitcoin is very very high, therefore making the position of power of those miners even more relevant than before.
I hope that makes sense.

As you said, if those charts were accurate, everyone would be a billionaire. Regression is nothing more than raw statistical analysis, it cannot be used to predict data that is affected by as many factors as currency and stock prices.

I remember watching this and thinking that he was probably exaggerating! Stupid one-year-younger me. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:31:13
I saw that yesterday. What don't I understand is how is this just now becoming known to everyone, if that was posted so many months ago?
And if it is indeed true, then Bitcoin is truly not decentralised, and I should swap my coins to BCH wait for some price spikes, take the gains, and never look back to crypto ever again. Because what they have done to it, is bad enough to create a reputation that people will always think of it as evil. That's IF that post is true.

 Can we be realistic for a moment, BTC is currently unusable and relatively expensive, plus in terms of crypto vs fiat, I’ve seen banks is several countries doing some great work creating easy and easy, quick and 0$ fee ways to send money. Just the other day we split a bill with my friends and he send me money using my mobile phone number which is received within seconds in my account (I live in Australia). In summary, the only thing BTC has that fiat doesn’t is somewhat higher security, but beyond that it is quite useless. I’m only here to see how this thing turns out in the end.

I think what he is trying to do is by using the word “more” he distinguishes as to what people perceive crypto currencies to be the most, assuming that most people sort of think they’re both an asset and a currency.

They probably have reserves large enough to convert to Dollars to keep it at that price. that is why they might have said that. That being said shortly after they do it eventually it will recover. I will do a full fiscal analysis of the bitcoin during my semester break if you are interested.
EDIT: Something to add. I was just doing some chart analysis and bitcoin broke through the resistances and the next one seems to be around th 5,000$ mark. If it breaks through i predict massive rally. If it doesnt i expect a pull back around 4050-40150$ probably a good buy zone.

China accounts for 24% of all bitcoin trades. The regulations and bans have not been implemented yet and bitcoin already took a plunge. Imagine what will happen when the bans will start rolling out faster. The situation is critical, I feel like some people forget that first rule of finance is that past performance does not guarantee future performance, because Bitcoin crashed and recovered before, it doesn't mean it will happen again.
@_date: 2017-09-27 02:36:27
That sort of confirms my suspicion that Bitcoin is indeed very unpopular in Europe, in fact most people haven't even heard the name "bitcoin"

I don't think people have enough knowledge to understand how bad would that be for Bitcoin in the short term. Like, seriously bad. But of course only if it actually happens.

I have two degrees in applied finance, it is absurd how unqualified people even try to argue with me in topics related to finance and cryptocurrencies. 
One thing I learned is to leave them in ignorance. Socrates one of the most progressive philosophers of his time always said people that think they know everything are the dumbest, and he had a point. 
People that think they know everything about a certain topic without researching it, never get the opportunity to improve because they are ignorant of what they don't know, they refuse to listen to a qualified opinion in relation to their finances which is why some of them end up bankrupt few years later.
tl:dr Just keep smiling and let the market do all the work, one day they will regret not listening to you.
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:18:02
Definitely there are many factors to take into account that makes it hard to give a definite answer. One of the first things you learn at economics 101 is that no answer is wrong if it can be substantiated.
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:24:12
That is assuming that bitcoin will actually become a widely used currency. Cause no matter what you think, the facts so far show that there is a chance this might never happen.

I still haven’t found a way to transfer a relatively large amount of my new through bitcoin overseas to be honest. Most licenced exchanges here in Australia only let you deposit $500 at a time
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:20:30
If you know what time value of money is, then this is totally the correct mindset currently for bitcoin. It does not help its popularity but it does help its store of value 
@_date: 2017-09-26 07:02:48
nice try
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:51:02
To be honest given the latest date from Europe and America I wouldn't expect euro and dollar to go down much. Also considering the he interest rate increases, that could mean the opposite. The recent down trend in dollar is probably because of the uncertainty in Asia caused by NK. Which is a good thing for Bitcoin and commodities like gold, because usually during times of distress people invest in them because they have a store value. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:20:42
Yep i send all the ID info and everything. I use 3 different type of exchanges Cointree, Coinbase and a regular bitcoin wallet with built in exchange from the app store, all of them have 500$ limit. Which exchange do you use?

If he actually did that, then he is liable for market manipulation that resulted to profits from arbitrage and it is a federal crime.

It makes sense. The week to week fluctuations are not bubbles, or crashes like some uneducated peeps call em. They are trading noise and they are normal.

Every time i see articles that make exaggerated predictions like that one, i instantly down vote. They have not financially accurate basis to make that predictions apart from the fact that they believe it is going to get more popular as the time goes by. Articles like that are the reason Analysts call Bitcoin a bubble.

Well, you see an economic recession will assist identifying the nature of Bitcoin as either just another currency or something with a store of value. No matter what everyone says it is not possible to predict but only speculate until it actually happens. 
In my opinion, as someone whos studying finance, I believe the value of Bitcoin could increase as people will try to find safe havens to store their money away from the influence of dollar et. I could be wrong, but as i said, there's no way of exactly predicting that right now.
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:31:29
That is literally the definition of a bubble.

No, it does not work that way, the Apple capitalization should still be worth the same and the share prices instead would be divided into more units meaning the share price would be lower. Anyone that says otherwise has no idea how basic business finance and math works.

They are two different exchanges. they are not related directly. Let's say the USD might drop against all currencies because the central bank decided to drop the interest rates, but that doesn't affect the value of the Euro in relation to Bitcoin but only in relation to USD directly.
As someone else said in finance we call that arbitrage, which is a way of profiting from the difference in prices quoted over a variety of different exchanges. Usually, that doesn't last long because the market tends to autocorrect after a while. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:36:30

Stop panicking.
This might be the first of many steps that Bank of China is taking to ensure that cryptocurrencies are limited, for the purpose of being easier to regulate and manage. That being said, no matter how anti-crypto that statement is, if a country with the population of China indeed plans to regulate Bitcoin, that is because it is becoming increasingly popular (which we already know). And 
it is also because they are planning to integrate the cryptocurrency system better into the economy and benefit from its features. As a result higher demand for the limited available cryptos will increase and they will start evaluating.
Its a long way to go, but in the end patience will pay off. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:57:08

I don’t know. It feels a lot like market manipulation at his point. One week bankers trash talk bitcoin and the next week they praise it. Don’t forget, these are the same people that were partially responsible for the GFC. They are as corrupted today as they used to be back then. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:28:06
Very good points. Including those factors with a numerical value are actually challenging. My basic instinct without any actual calculations would make me think that a shortage would only work in favor of Bitcoin price since the change in demand ΔD would outpace the change in Supply ΔS. And an increase in popularity of bitcoin would have the same result.
Now if the % that people come into bitcoin remains the same then my above calculations are close to be accurate.
IF on the other hand that % increases then we could expect a FV even higher than 100K.
That is because the above model assumes that all else, including the increase % in demand, supply ( no of adopters, popularity, shortage) remain the same.
I hope that helps. :)

Negative pricing is actually possible.
I haven’t watched/read the Bloomberg is interview, but here’s what I think they might mean:
Electric companies use it when there is oversupply that does not meet demand, in a similar way, what I think they meant by this comment is that miners will literally pay you to own btc to promote short term demand to cover their supply creation.
