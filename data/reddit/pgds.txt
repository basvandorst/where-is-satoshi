As a person who uses bitcoin to do business with on a daily basis that is not drug or child porn related - (I save on payPal fees transacting with Bitcoin, I sell advertising) I am trying to think of a suitable reply for your anti-crypto argument and the only one that can express what the very core of me feels about your statement is "fuck you, you fucking retarded neanderthal, you don't have the foggiest notion what you are talking about, please do not breed and please crawl back under a rock"

I hear ya and I am already looking at getting a trezor but my question was not about hardware wallets, but about the vault on coinbase - I want to know if it is even remotely susceptible to a hack

I swear, I can hear you people groaning over the internet.

We can put it to a vote.

Honestly it's something really small and insignificant but it irks me.
Even worse, someone added it to the wikipedia entry

I paid 20c on a $200 tx.
the same tx over paypal would have cost me $6.10 (2.9%+30c)
I would gladly pay bitcoin fees over paypal's fees any day.
Paypal don't even offer lube or cuddling after.

I went to the D last year to see if they had gaming machines using btc. They don't. They accept btc in their giftshop and they have an atm.
The spread on the ATM was insanity.

fee or fees? say for example a block has 0.2 btc worth of mining fees in it's transactions - the block reward is now 12.7 btc ?
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:24:32
because with a 1 mb block size, the mining rewards could grow to big amounts when people pay the higher fees. on the flipside though, the bigger the block size, the more tx's - the more fees and we go from 6 tx/s to 24tx/s
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:11:56
Now I understand why the miners don't want change lol

bitcoin was only ever sent from coinbase to coinpayments to make our outgoing payments.

I looked at Kraken but don't see USD in their list of currencies to deposit. Unless I'm looking in the wrong place?
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:30:35
yeah but thats my point - the miners were loving the fees so a fork to a bigger block puts a bit of a dent in that - unless a bigger block size means more tx's and it evens out if it doesnt actually mean more money for them.

Ah right - I'm outside of the US - but I can get one of my partners to open an account.
