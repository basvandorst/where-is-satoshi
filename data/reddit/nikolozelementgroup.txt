There is a buy and hold strategy and a more short-term oriented one. Both have their merits and require a specific approach. There is no right thing that could be said here. Decide what is your style of investment and follow it.

That's true for sure. But I mean after the fork.

If they did not, you would need quite a few of bitcoins to buy yourself a computer.

Soon they will stop agreeing, and demand to get paid in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:18:19
HODL for sure!
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:20:33
You are a bit late to the party

Note, they put a heavy limit on the amount
 purchased.
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:32:12
If that's even remotely true, it will easily reach $20,000+
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:59:35
Whats your reason? adoption? market sentiments?
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:05:34
Do they ask for a margin? :d

A significant part of the community sees it as a speculative investment, and it does a good job of being one.
BTC does not work well as a currency, too volatile.
I personally think of it as a potential reserve. If it can capture say 5% of gold funds, it would be very very good.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:01:56
I see a substantial upside in the long term.
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:18:34
For the short term? I don't think it is the right time.
There is a point of investing for the long term if you have a certain scenario in mind.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:44:48
HODL HODL HODL
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:01:54
Some are late to the party!
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:05:53
Hope it goes much higher before that!!!!

Let the ruling classes tremble at a crypto revolution. Workingmen of all countries, unite!
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:15:39
If you have an open position, how can this annoy you?!
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:56:55
How long do you see it lasting?
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:16:51
Why do you expect a dip to follow?
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:28:34
It is hard to imagine ban from countries like China being positive, even with all uncertainty with regulation. I understand what you are saying solid regulation is a positive thing, and I believe China will hoop back as sone as they have one too.

@_date: 2017-10-21 14:17:55
True! But then it won't be a good investment, so you have a dilemma there.
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:53:38
Still pretty cool
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:13:05
Then you will be good
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:22:31
I do not think one can be certain when talking about correction, the market is very fragile anything can trigger a run. The good questions you could ask, does it have solid fundamental value? is it overvalued?
@_date: 2017-10-21 11:37:27
If you are going to ride it, than what's the problem?
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:02:34
Would anyone want to borrow BTC. It seems like you could squeeze a bit more than just holding for the long term.
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:03:06
Simple but beautiful!!!!
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:53:48
How far do you see it going, before the end of the year?
