You might as well put the current fee up there so people know when they can use that worthless coin.

You do realize that Banks don’t control your money...
Sounds like your mother is just irresponsible and crypto is definitely not for her.

I’m calling bullshit. Upload a picture of the letter they sent you. They would absolutely have to tell you why your account was closed. 
You’re full of shit.

The only way they’re closing your account is if you are a horrible customer and you are severely overdrawn (charged off), or if you were engaging in illegal activity (money laundering). 
If they so happen to close your account for any other reason, then you are looking at a massive lawsuit in your favor. 
Post the document OP, I dare you.
