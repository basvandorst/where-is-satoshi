If anything that bodes well for bitcoin. Credit card processing requires massive legal and physical infrastructure, but bitcoin only requires a phone or computer. It's a godsend for the unbanked majority. Just look at the success of m-pesa despite atrocious fees and nonexistent security. Their customers went from no banks to banks in their pocket overnight. Most people have never seen a credit card, but they'll all be using electronic money of some kind within the decade.

You don't have to destroy the computer, just the disc that contains the OP you used to generate your private keys. And if you use a live CD (which can't be written to) you don't even have to do that. Furthermore, I wouldn't recommend buying a new computer for this now that you've told the whole internet about your  plans, it might arrive bugged. Just take your existing computer apart to check it for hardware keyloggers and the like, then boot your live CD and go.
You are correct that a VPN is unnecessary. OP probably didn't realize that you can generate addresses offline.

You blew my mind with "proof-of-violence". It really sums up state-sponsored currency.

People have been implanting NFC tags into their hands for a long time. It's just one of the least painful and most accessible places.
The innovation here is that we now have software that allows you to load in an encrypted private key and send coins from it without ever storing the key. This allows you to spend coins in cold storage without compromising their security. You can load in the keys from anywhere or type them in manually, but if you already have a tag in you then why not use it? This way you can never lose your coins. Like a brain wallet, only easier to remember and more secure.
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:36:12
The coins are not sent to the address with a normal transaction, they are mined directly into the address. Most exchanges and web wallets don't support odd transactions like this very well.
@_date: 2014-08-18 05:46:49
Even more interesting is that all phones (even smart phones) have the capacity to allow the user to interact with the software running on the SIM. Many European carriers use this to build a menu for managing account right on the phone — no Internet required.

Net Neutrality isn't giving the government control over the Internet. It is using the control that the government already has over businesses that provide Internet connections to prevent them from implementing policies which anti-competitive, anti-consumer, and anti-freedom. It is simply protective regulation of essential services, the same kind that applies with great success to electricity, water, and telephone suppliers. These kinds of businesses have natural monopolies due to the extremely high cost of infrastructure, so special consideration is necessary to keep things fair. But net neutrality doesn't have anything to do with breaking those monopolies as you proposed. It just makes every company that supplies communication obligated not to participate in censorship or wiretapping.

In the US there is a large distinction between wire transfers and what we call ACH transfers. Wire transfers have large fees and many banks do not offer them.

In the past, the only way to spend money from a private key was to  permanently import it into a wallet. You could "sweep" the coins off the private key and into another address you control, but you could not send some coins from the key and send the change back to the same key. So any time you wanted to withdraw from cold storage, you had to destroy and remake your storage medium.
As for security, malicious software would need root access in order to read the key in memory. It is very easy to spot things unexpectedly running as root on android because ordinarily, nothing does.

That's not a slight technical inaccuracy, it is a  fundamental misrepresentation of the most important and least complicated element of the Bitcoin philosophy.

That was clearly just a typo, a and s are adjacent on the qwerty keyboard.
"Fiat" means "faith" in latin. Fiat currency is currency whose value is not intrinsic (as are precious metals) but based on the faith of the users. Traditionally, we mean their faith in the government or non-governmental bank that backs the currency, but faith in the community is equally valid. Bitcoin was bootstraped by proof-of-work and the US Dollar was bootstrapped by proof-of-violence, but both are now sustained by faith. We are pushing the frontier with these cryptographic currencies and we really don't have the wording to describe them adequately yet.

Thanks for explaining, that makes a lot of sense. My post above was purely a joke, as Ron Paul is a Republican and most Bitcoin users tend to be significantly more Libertarian. In fact, it was a Republican Congressman who made a comment that he thought Bitcoin was "dangerous" and potentially illegal. Anyway, that's not all that relevant because Ron Paul differs very much from mainstream Republican ideals.
As you said, one can only speculate as to who Satoshi might have been. I never considered before that he might be an economist, I always just assumed that he was an individual who was inspired by the he failure of similar projects and realized he could do better. In my opinion, the "deflationary" nature of Bitcoin would have been an obvious design decision, even for someone with no knowledge of economics. The initial production of Bitcoins had to be fast in order to introduce enough currency for the economy to function, but this could not be sustainable, so the rate of production slows over time and eventually stops. The fact that coins are not created infinitely may have simply been the simplest and most predictable solution. It's very plausible that Satoshi *was* an economist, but I'm not entirely convinced. 
I learned a bit about Austrian economics in my high school government class. The textbook was published years ago and didn't mention Ron Paul, though I think the teacher brought him up. As far as I can understand, there are a two simple reasons why most mainstream economists believe that a small, predictable amount of inflation is desirable. First, inflation is simply unavoidable in practice, so you could consider it an effort to realistically minimize the problem. Second,  and more important, is that inflation acts as an invisible and unavoidable tax which hits the rich who horde savings more then the poor. Of course, an Austrian economist would argue that inflation also devalues already-meager the wages of the poor, who are unlikely to get annual raises. Now, keep in mind that I know almost nothing about economics *or* Ron Paul, so don't give him all the credit. 
Anyway, I'd like to see another political survey of the Bitcoin community. You said that Ron Paul supporters helped the project grow, and while I find that easy to agree with, I don't have any evidence to support it.

Those were the examples talked about in the article. Applying it to Bitcoin is harder because Bitcoin combines multiple algorithms in ways that sometimes reduce the keyspace. Bitcoin doesn't have the full strength of AES behind it.

That is another important clarification, thanks. Although,  once you get past a certain point, brute forcing would take so long that the universe would end before you found the result. One might call that truly unbreakable, but I think that the keysize would have to be unreasonably large.

The more income I have, the more I realize how screwed up the current financial system is. It's nothing malicious or intentional, just a depreciated system on its way out. Everything is slow and expensive and complicated and cumbersome. It sucks. 
There is no easy way to convert between physical and electronic money. If I have a $50 bill and I want to buy a new game on Steam, I have to find to an ATM, deposit the money, and wait 3-5 days - or alternatively drive 15 miles to the nearest bank branch.
There is no easy way to send money. I can mail cash or check, but then I have to pay postage and risk loss or theft, and wait a week. If I transfer money via Dwolla, I still have to pay $0.25 and wait a week. A bank transfer is faster, but fees can be as high as 10%.
Banks are not open on weekends or holidays. My waiting a week is now waiting 10 days.

A year ago, MyBitcoin shut down and everyone was upset about their coin being stolen. Over on the forums, I suggested that people track the path of the stolen coin and post the relevant transactions so that merchants and exchanges could refuse to accept them. Of course, I wasn't the only person with this idea and someone even got as far as generating a diagram showing the flow, but people lost interest and I don't think any significant volume of funds were ever recovered.
Today, Bitcoinica lost some of their coin, and they actually took the initiative to work with the exchanges to track the transactions involved. Mt. Gox is actively suspending any account that tries to sell the stolen coin, and it looks like a full-scale investigation will be underway as soon as enough stolen coin or evidence to the thief's identity has been recovered. OP has a minor incontinence totaling less than $150 held temporarily, and suddenly people are bitching about lawsuits and saying Bitcoin is going to die.
Mt. Gox is the responsible party here, and they are doing their part to uphold what Bitcoin represents by taking advantage of the inherent auditability of transactions to enable distributed justice and deter fraud.

It would be impossible to shut down the Internet unless you were to take (nearly) every single exchange offline. Some of the exchanges might cooperate, but I think most administrators would have to be dragged screaming into a jail cell before allowing their systems to be taken down. The systems, however, can run without human intervention, so aggressor would have to physically cut power or data lines. If things ever got to that point, there would be a civil war.

What stops the thief from just sending coins to a different wallet also owned by them? I would agree that it's unfair to be indiscriminate, but right now they are doing damage control.

@_date: 2012-06-15 06:21:52
You can't use your credit or debit cards directly with the vast majority of exchanges because credit card transactions are reversible and Bitcoin transactions are not. There is a very common scam in which a person buys something with their card and then reports the card as stolen, which causes the bank to take the money back from the seller,allowing the buyer to get the item for free. This is called chargeback fraud and is very hard to get away with when physical items are involved, but in the case of a Bitcoin exchanges the seller has no recourse and would get screwed over every time. Dwolla doesn't use the credit or debit card system, it uses echeck, the same system used to deposit pay checks but in reverse. They also impose a photo ID verification and a waiting period to make sure the echeck won't "bounce" and allow you to commit chargeback fraud. Bitcoin exchanges like this because transactions within Dwolla are not reversible just like transactions within Bitcoin, so there is zero risk save the initial risk taken by Dwolla itself. 
@_date: 2012-04-12 23:34:21
Can you explain how to set this up?
@_date: 2012-06-15 05:52:51
Bitcoin exchanges work just like any kind of currency exchange. You can both buy and sell Bitcoin at current market value, or you can put in various types of bids if you think the price is going to change. I would recommend that you use Dwolla to get USD into your exchange (Mt. Gox and Tradehill both allow this), but Liberty Reserve is more secure if you are more patient and willing to pay more fees. You may also use bank transfers for very large amounts. Some sites exist that will let you purchase Bitcoin with credit card or PayPal, but this is risky for the seller and so uncommon. You might check the  IRC channel on Freenode if you want to try to trade directly with individuals. You can send me a PM if you want to arrange a small exchange via PayPal or Dwolla.

I think that having Bitcoins integrated into the server economy is a very good idea, but it could cause issues with your experiment. You might consider making an official market system where various in-game valuables (not just diamonds) can be bought and sold at auction for other in-game items and/or Bitcoins. Using an auction format would ensure that you do not impact the game economy by setting fixed values to items. In this way, Bitcoin would become an official currency for the server. There are still a few problems, but it might be worth a trial run.
EDIT: I've been looking over your subreddit, and I'm starting to get the feeling that Bitcoin doesn't really fit with your server's premise. However, attempting to ban it would be useless. I've got nothing.

Unless some significant flaw in the AES algorithm is discovered in the future, it will never be possible to brute force AES-256 without a quantum computer. However, using current computers even AES-128 is impossible to brute force.

Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

Okay, fine. The difference is bigger for international transactions. PayPal, for example, charges 3.99% + 0.30 USD, which on a 0.99 USD transaction (ie. one song) would be 34%. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has no inherent fees, and converting to local currency on Mt.Gox costs only 0.6%. Alternatively, use BitPay with auto conversion, and the fee is 2.99% (0.99% without). Even BitInstant is only 3.99%, with no flat fee attached like PayPal.

This could be done much more elegantly with a ethernet-equipped microcontroller plugged into the machine's bill reader interface. Each machine would have an account and receiving address managed by a central server, which it would communicate with over RPC. The QR code with the address would be painted on to the front of the machine, no need for a display. The microcontroller would continually poll the server to see if its balance has increased, at which point it would signal the machine to update its credit count. Purchases would happen with the normal keypad, and any change or refunds would be sent back to the address that sent the original payment. It might also be possible to periodically update the prices to match the latest exchange rates.

You can see a real-time log of all blocks and their sizes on [Block Explorer]( A new block should be mined every 10 minutes, but sometimes this can vary significantly. A Bitcoin transaction is received instantly, but takes an average of 60 minutes (6 blocks) to be marked as confirmed/cleared. Older versions of the client accepted transactions as confirmed after only 3 blocks (30 minutes), and some 3rd-party clients only require one block (10 minutes).

This video bothers me. It has a lot of well-presented facts that check out well, but it never explains most of them. They go on and on about why banks have too much power, and demonstrate how the banks got that power, but they never tell the viewer how that power has been abused. 
Also, the viewer is  left with the impression that the Federal Reserve has control over the printing of money and the standardization of interest rates, but this is patently false. Money is printed by the Treasury Department, under the sole direction of Congress, and only given to the Federal Reserve for distribution. Interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve, but they must present their proposed rates to Congress for approval, and they are contractually bound to choose rates based on the same method as the LIBOR. In my high school economics class, the (Republican) teacher had to explain this multiple times.
Anyway, I wasn't commenting on the politics of money, I was commenting on the workings of the banks. The credit union of which I am a shareholder does their best to provide a valuable service and never charge fees, but they can't control the actions of other banks, they can't be open 24/7, they can't process transactions instantly, and they can't take my money through a computer screen.
Think about what banks do today. They store your money in a manner that is guaranteed to be safe, they provide you access to that money by way of the ACH system (even converting to foreign currencies for you if necessary), and they pay you a useless amount of interest in exchange for the right to invest any money you aren't using at the moment. But what if there was a bank that did all of that while simultaneously functioning as a Bitcoin wallet service? You could keep a small amount of Bitcoin on your phone or PC to use as cash, or just make all your transactions from the bank website. Your account balance would be kept in Bitcoins or in the currency of your choosing, and automatically converted when you make a transaction. You get a Bitcoin payment, and you can withdraw local currency from the nearest ATM within 10 minutes. It would be fantastic for traveling. Unfortunately, ACH deposits would still be subject to the customary week-long delay, but all the more reason to do transactions in Bitcoin!

You are talking about the [monetary base]( or the current amount of money that is currently available for spending. By buying and selling government bonds and raising and lowering inter-bank interest rates, the federal reserve can encourage both banks and their customers to either save or invest. High interest rates discourage borrowing and therefore spending, and when the federal reserve sells bonds before they mature, it encourages investors to buy them. Money that is tied up in loans or investments is not spendable, so the perceived effect is deflation of the economy, even though no money has been destroyed. Unfortunately, this effect is only temporary, as the federal reserve cannot sell more bonds than it has or raise interest rates without ever lowering them again.

I also sold a load of bitcoin back when it was worth less than $10. I've since sworn off selling bitcoin, now I only spend it.

Pool operators actually have essentially zero power. They can try to broadcast invalid blocks but they won't get relayed by anyone. They can try to double-spend, but you can only really get away with that once. The only thing they could pull off with impunity would be arbitrarily excluding certain transactions.

I'm actually pretty excited about this. Two more pieces of advice: First, cut down on the number of messages that need to be sent *and* received by the customer as much as possible, because many people still so not have unlimited SMS, and in the US, we pay for incoming messages. Second, get someone else who knows what they're doing to evaluate whatever method of encryption or two factor authentication you choose, because I certainly don't, and even an experienced programmer will overlook things.

Simple. Write a minimalist J2ME app, small enough to be attached to an MMS, which implements two factor authentication. When someone tries to send coins, you reply with a short numeric code, which they enter into the app along with their pin. The app takes those plus the current unix time, encrypts them with your public key, and sends result via SMS. Even if an attacker can intercept communication in both directions, they still need the pin, which is now being sent encrypted.

@_date: 2011-06-07 16:38:04
I agree with most of your points, but:
* Multiple receiving addresses are a fundamental feature of bitcoin.
* It's called an address book because you give each person you know a different address, so that you can tell where a transaction came from.
* There is no way to tell which address sent a transaction to you.
* The time is UTC, which should be obvious, as it's how most banks so it.
@_date: 2011-04-28 23:34:00
Sure it scales, it just becomes more centralized as it does.
If we are expecting 2k tps with a block size of 1 GB, then the hardware we have right now will work just fine. My home connection can download 1 GB in less than 10 minutes (1024 MB * 8 bits / 600 sec = 13.65 Mb/s), and so would be able to keep up with the block chain no problem. As for storage, even if we don't "prune" irrelevant information from archived blocks, a 2TB HDD could still hold 2 weeks of blocks (2048 GB / (7 days * 24 hours * 6 blocks) = 2 weeks). Now, let's assume for a moment that the network has exactly 1000 nodes (approximately the number in operation today), that each node represents an identical miner, and that all transactions bear a 0.01 BTC fee. Each node would then receive 1728 BTC **per day** in tariffs, plus a 50 BTC bonus just shy of weekly. At current exchange rates, the node operator could then afford to purchase 40 new drives each time he filled one up, and still have enough money left over to pay for electricity and bandwidth.
I deem this *extremely* profitable.

I was using rpcminer-4way, and it said something along the lines of "long poll... new block found!", which it has never said before.

Besides, my GPU miners find blocks all the time.

If analysis like this can be done automatically and in real time, you could effectively establish a dynamically-updating blacklist of addresses containing the stolen coins. All willing parties could then refuse to do business with them, and the stolen funds would become useless. Even better, a reputable exchange could accept the contraband willingly and then return it to the rightful owner, perhaps even obtaining an email address which would be linkable in some way to the perp's irl identity.

This is a wonderful read. It's things like this that make statistics fun. Absolutely fascinating! 
They weren't able to identify the thief, but they discovered some useful patterns in the network and were able to trace all of the stolen funds and tie the thief beach to an earlier crime. Depending on how mybitcoin keeps their records, it may still be possible to recover some of the coins or trace them further, though I doubt the relevant records ever existed on the first place. Maybe the major wallet services will be able to learn from this and bring justice to future would-be thieves. :)

No, I was mining in Slush's pool with a 5770, 5850, and two quad cores. I personally found 3 blocks for the pool, but earned more like 20 blocks worth fractionally. I recently switched to Mt. Red and started monitoring the displayed hashrate to see how out compares to the calculated one on the Mt. Red stats page. I was astounded to find that on two different occasions, the pool found a new block within 30 seconds of the miner launching, the probability if which is nearly 4000 to 1 against. I originally believed the indication might have been about me finding the blocks, but I have since learned otherwise. I posted here expecting a few lolz and a high five or two, but I got downvotes, so I deleted the post.

I don't believe that the US has export regulations on encryption any more, but in case they do, you can always use Blowfish, the runner up in the AES competition.
Also, I have a few more suggestions:
* Allow RPC connections over SSL (the current windows builds of the official client do not).
* Allow importing private keys by typing/pasting as well as a key file (redeeming bitbills).
* Have an optional reminder to change your password frequently.
* Deploy an auto-updater system.
* If you go open source, merge your changes into the official repo.

Absolutely! If you have an android phone or emulator, you can run either of the two bitcoin apps, which use a pruning technique to eliminate the need to store a full copy of the blockchain. I'm currently working on a desktop client based on the same code these apps use. As for your first question, the full transaction database is only about 900 MB once it has finished downloading and compressed itself.

I would have to recommend bitbills (because I have some) and phoneco.in (because I had a nice chat with the owner). Other than that, I would recommend getting a cheap notebook without a webcam, or putting tape over/removing the webcam, if that's acceptable. If there is no wifi on the show floor, then you should get a 3G card off ebay and use your prepaid sim in it. If the convention is a multi-day thing, I would say the best idea would be to take names and orders, let the customer send payment when they get back to their hotel, and then have them pick up the order the following day.
EDIT: Now that I think about it, you could just show them how to sign up for a phoneco.in account tell them to deposit some funds over lunch, and do the whole transaction all at once, no need to take names. You could even buy a decent chunk of bitcoins ahead of time and sell bitcoins for cash on the show floor, which would be a nice way to pay it forward to the next guy who accepts bitcoins from them.

This is all very interesting. I was actually wondering earlier about the possibility of double-spending attacks, and managed to convince myself that they aren't a big deal for retailers because they only have a small possibility of working. Even if you controlled 5% of the network, you would have to purchase an item 20 times before you get one for free. Naturally, services such as exchanges wallets where you can withdraw your money are still vulnerable, and so they should wait for 3 confirmations, or two if you can detect and ignore competing blocks. 
Retailers could either mark up bitcoin transactions by a certain percentage - as is currently done to combat credit card chargebacks - or simply trust that a person would have difficulty pulling off a double-spending attack from their cell phones. In fact, it's *probably* sufficient to say that if you receive a transaction from *all* of your peers, then you can accept it without any confirmation.

Two days later, I tried the service and thought of a few more things.
1) I'm really impressed with how you can send bitcoins to a phone number and [make a phone call to a bitcoin address]( It's a beautiful hack!
2) I think you should prompt new customers to setup an (optional) password, since this feature is currently only mentioned on the website.
3) I think that the confirmation text should provide a way to void the transaction rather than just confirm/do nothing, in case people mistype and freak out when they see no way to cancel.
4) It would be useful to have a form on the website which lets you initiate a payment online and confirm it on your phone. Typing a bitcoin address into your phone isn't exactly easy.
5) When you add currency conversion, it would be best if you support **all** major currencies, and use the 24-hour volume-weighted average price from bitcoincharts.com. The confirmation message should also make it clear that the value will be sent in BTC, and that the exchange rates are for reference only.
6) I would like to see a "lend" command added in addition to the "pay" command, which takes an interest rate percentage as an additional argument. The system would then provide the payee with a code reflecting the loan, which could be used with the pay command to make payments. Interest would compound monthly, and phoneco.in might take a cut. Additionally, there would be a "debt" command to see all debts ("debt  to detail a specific one) and monthly SMS reminders. Lend money to your friends and actually get paid back!

They would print out a QR code containing their bitcoin address, which you would scan with your phone. You could then send payment using mybitcoin or a bitcoin app on your phone.

How about a virtual world like the one in *Snow Crash*, except with land allocated via mining? Coins could be numbered sequentially and each represent a small plot of land, spiraling outwards from the center of the world. Your client would use the blockchain to identify the current owner of every plot within view, then connect to a server run by that owner. Movement between plots would be governed by p2p consensus, while your actions within a specific plot would be entirely up to the owner.

hi there friend, i just thought you should know that there is a good reason for this. we like dwolla here because it doesn't allow chargebacks and prevents related fraud. when you add money from your bank account, dwolla waits until they actually have the money before crediting you, which takes up to 14 days in the traditional banking system. once the money is in dwolla, there is no risk of chargebacks, so transfers happen instantly. sorry for caps, this should really be in the sidebar.

The rate of block production is completely arbitrary, and established by consensus. However, changing it would be a "hard fork", requiring more than half of the network to make the change simultaniously. This has never happened before, at least not intentionally.

Taxes are a mutual agreement between the population and their government which are paid in exchange for social services and infrastructure.  If you don't like how your tax dollars are being allocated, get elected to office and make some changes.
Traditionally, the more money you make, the more of it you pay in taxes. This helps the poor by removing much of the burden of taxation from them. Unfortunately, the poor spend virtually all of their money buying things, while the rich invest most of their money. Therefore, sales taxes tax affects the poor far more than the rich.

That's generally how it works in the US. It's almost impossible to contract with credit card companies directly, so you instead go through a third party that charges a small monthly fee in exchange for setting you up with access to every payment network you could possibly want. Needless to say, these companies won't let you opt out of certain networks, it comes as a package. The only people that have a choice in the matter are customers, who don't even see the fees. That's why you see some stores give you a discount for paying in cash.

You're right, Budovsky was a US citizen living in the US in 2001, which is apparently when Liberty Reserve was originally founded. The current company was incorporated in Costa Rica in 2006, but it appears that Budovsky was still a US citizen (though not necessarily living in the US) until 2012. That said, the company has never maintained offices within the US, and Costa Rican law limits Budovsky's liability for the actions of his company.
I'd also like to say that none of the articles so far have demonstrated any ways in which Liberty Reserve has broken Costa Rican law nor any international treaties, only how they may have run afoul of certain US regulations. I think we can agree that the legality of the actions against the company are dubious.

No, they aren't very big issues. It's just cheap and easy to buy a used bill acceptor from an arcade machine parts store, while an ATM style bill dispensor isn't the kind of thing that your average ebay seller has lying around. Sending the excess coin back to the address that sent it is the obvious solution, but may not work with all hosted wallets. Double-spending attacks aren't a real pressing issue either, because nobody has ever been able to demonstrate one in a practical manner.

There at least use to be an SMS-based wallet service, which let anyone with a phone use bitcoin. Combine that with the ability to buy bitcoins on your phone bill and the ability to send coins by email, and you've got a 100% solution for poor countries.

Net neutrality is the idea that all internet traffic should be treated equally. No censorship, no throttling, and no metering. Without net neutrality, ISPs are free to selectively route traffic for in unfair ways. For example, an ISP might cause their own VoIP or streaming video service to load faster and more reliably than competing services. They might intentionally slow down large downloads because they could contain copyrighted material, and block torrent indexing sites altogether. They might even block access to legitimate streaming sites, or place volume limits on your connection to prevent you from using them. This isn't speculation, *all of this has already happened*. Net neutrality isn't control of the internet, it is regulation of anti-competitive business practices.

PayPal isn't part of the american banking system, it is just a bank that tries to provide a valuable service for its customers.

No, you don't have to wait for any confirmations. Nobody has ever successfully done a double-spending attack in a retail environment, and I doubt that they ever will. Besides, if you accepted credit cards, you would have to wait at least week to be sure you wouldn't be a victim of chargeback fraud.

This isn't a realistic proposal. First, a transition from government to anarchy would be chaotic and violent. Imagine the looting and rioting that occurs in the silence after a natural disaster, but on a larger scale. Second, anarchy doesn't stick. In history, every single time an anarchy has been created, the resulting power vacuum causes people to join together and establish new government(s). Take feudal England as an example: there was no monarchy yet, just a multitude of small, local governments that existed to protect the peasants from each other. Now, you might argue that a new government would be just the right thing in this occasion, but you don't need to destroy the old one to do it.

You're operating a private network with limited bandwidth. You need to conserve your resources, so anything not strictly business related can be considered "abusive". That's perfectly reasonable.

Precious metals aren't money, they are commodities. If you compare the industrial supply and demand vs the market price of gold and platinum:
* platinum ($47.46 per gram): 130 tons consumed / 63.6 tons produced = 2.04
* gold ($46.94 per gram): 3766 tons consumed / 2400 tons produced = 1.57
Both metals are becoming more valuable as we consume more than we can produce, but platinum is both already scarcer and becoming scarcer faster.
* relative scarcity of platinum: 2.04 / 1.57 = 1.30
* relative price of platinum: 47.46 / 46.94 = 1.01
* relative value of platinum: 1.30 / 1.01 = 1.29
Gold, on the other hand, has a price which has been overinflated by speculation:
* relative scarcity of gold: 1.57 / 2.04 = 0.77
* relative price of gold: 46.94 / 47.46 = 0.99
* relative value of gold: 0.77 / 0.99 = 0.78
Therefore, the prices *should be*:
* theoretical price of platinum: $47.46 * 1.29 = $61.22
* theoretical price of gold: $46.94 * 0.78 = $36.61

There are of course other companies, like Discover, DCI, Entrust, Cirrus, and Plus. The problem is that *most* customers will have either Visa or Mastercard, so the stores are forced to at least accept those. Your customers would be annoyed if you claimed to accept credit cards and then refused their Visa because you only accept Cirrus. There is no inter-operation between credit card networks. I think Visa and Mastercard are dominant because they were among the first to be accepted thought both Europe and North America.

There are only two credit card companies. Don't like Visa? Well, I hope you're okay with Mastercard instead.
@_date: 2013-02-18 01:53:49
That's correct.
@_date: 2013-03-31 21:21:11
Isn't a paper wallet just a private key printed out so that you can import it again later?
@_date: 2013-08-20 14:34:04
I like that way of thinking.
@_date: 2013-01-13 20:57:05
I think that it's hilarious that he actually accepted preorders via credit cards rather than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:09:55
I normally try to avoid feeding trolls, but I'll bite. The EFF is an international charity that lobbies for the freedom of information and other personal liberties. They frequently aid in the legal defense of whistleblowers, have briefed the supreme court of the US on several occasions, and have even hired whitehat hackers to demonstrate vulnerabilities in popular software and help fix them.

He's got a new album coming out soon, so I sent him an email asking about bitcoin. He posted his address is on the "send a thanks" page, [it looks like I'm the only donor so far](

I dunno. 
On one hand, mortgages suck. 
On the other, real estate is the worst investment I can imagine, unless you count a crippling gambling addiction as an investment. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:02:29
I'm just going to try to stop thinking about the 250 BTC I sold two years ago. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:50:42
"micro" 
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:33:38
That would be (and probably is) an option, but it would be really expensive unless the banks were run by the government. I'd actually like to see a federally-run bank that is free for all to use, with private banks competing. I think that private-public competition makes sense in a lot of industries. For now though, the closest thing we have are nonprofit credit unions.
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:09:15
Thanks, for some reason it wouldn't let me edit that field on my phone, but it works on my computer.

Why can't hot wallets be encrypted? The password could be entered when the server starts up, then the decryption key would only exist in ram and the computer could access the wallet transparently just like any other encrypted file. Stealing those coins would either require rooting the server or finding an exploit in the application code unrelated to encryption.

I'd love it if flattr accepted bitcoin, but for now I'd just ask individual sites to post donation addresses.
@_date: 2013-03-24 17:22:23
How are you going about that? I've got an American Express gift card (prepaid debit card) and have yet to find a single store - online or IRL - that accepts them. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 18:37:37
I agree that sales tax is an unfair tax which disproportionately impacts the poor. However, VAT doesn't apply to everything, and it also is a tax that helps fund your government. Transaction fees go entirely to a private entity that exists for the sole purpose of screwing you. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 01:38:09
Blame the US government's obsession with surveillance in the name of catching drug dealers, money launderers, and terrorists. You may have more luck with an exchange based in Europe. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 18:55:30
Most people will tell you that they hold on to their coin, but I have trouble with that. I constantly spend them on things and never have much on hand. 
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:25:29
What I mean to say is that a page view will generally count as an impression even if you use adblock. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:36:56
Can you tell me which elements to block, and how? I was able to visit the page by deleting the two fancybox elements, but they don't seem to be ad-blockable.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:17:11
Exactly, there is no way that it will accept credit cards.
@_date: 2013-05-29 20:31:42


Doesn't Liberty Reserve operate in Costa Rica by a man who isn't an American citizen? Did the DOJ just use its "anti-terrorism" powers to shut down a company that doesn't operate within their jurisdiction? What does the Costa Rican government have to say about this? 
@_date: 2013-05-24 23:31:41
Well, there is technically also American Express, but it is not accepted anywhere in the known Universe, and therefore not terribly useful unless you happen to be Ford Prefect.
@_date: 2013-05-24 20:44:18
Visa and Mastercard provide a valuable service to their customers by giving them credit cards, and they make massive amounts of money on interest. The 4% or more that they charge the retailers whom they depend on for their credit cards to be useful is unreasonable. Perhaps a 1% or less fee would be more reasonable.

So, options include filling a snack machine with envelopes stuffed with cash or becoming a real bank.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:54:05
I'm not him, but I think it would look like a smartcard. The card would hold your private keys and the the seed for generating new ones, and would be able to form transactions by itself. You'd have a client on your computer that only acts as a front end and a bridge to the blockchain. To send money, you would put the card into your reader and enter a password, and to receive money at a fresh address you'd do the same (old addresses could be reused without the card). You'd be able to make multiple copies of the same card and keep them in safe locations as backups. The card could even have NFC so that you can make transactions on your phone.

It also gives you a secure place to store your Bitcoin that you can access from anywhere via SSH. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:48:44
This was actually proposed on the wiki years ago. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 20:09:52
It still costs far less than western union. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:32:31
You could theoretically do everything on a smartcard. I wonder if they have considered it. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 17:15:11
And Bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:46:02
They also cost *more* than western union.
