@_date: 2015-05-05 19:14:54
Hey i just stopped by = ) 
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:22:15
have the same problem... what is going on??
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:13:41
thanks!!! thats awesome = ) 
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:51:10
just wow
@_date: 2013-10-21 13:35:19
had 1 btc but played satoshi dice too hard..
well i guess that's just my poker nature ; P
@_date: 2013-10-28 11:09:05
well its just for my personal saving wallet, an easy way to save with every payment.
i mean doesnt satoshi dice does something similar? or do i get it totally wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:07:52
i agree with you on that, thats why i also have gold^^
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:20:40
this is a great idea!! 
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:18:54
ok i print this paperwallet out and send btc to the adress, but how do i withdraw from the wallet? 
im a new to bitcoin, so just a technical question = ) 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:04:42
wow guys, i just see the people buying in again with a massive gain! right now is just perfect to buy again with the prices like this! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:39:18
i know that feeling bro, stay strong and next time you will be definatly wiser in handling with your coins! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:25:29
i store my money on a bank account, because i didnt have a choice until now.
in austria you dont have the option to make a phone contract without an account.
or get your money from the firm without an account.
alle the options security, lending and more i can do better with bitcoin.
and i dont have the possibility that somebody is watching and knows exactly where and on what i spend my money on.
banks wont last, maybe some other form of a bank, but in a more open source way than it is today.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:11:28
well guys, banks are afraid of bitcoin, thats very good!
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:40:06
this chart can't be right, because bitcoin is not an asset but a value store place, and you have to count in that the more people fear losing their money to the banks, the more the value of bitcoin raises.
and the raise will be exponantial, so when you fear your btc will loose in value then sell them, however i personally am going for the long turn, and i expect btc to raise up to 1000 EUR or USD per btc ; ) 
however thats my opinion = ) 
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:59:09
ok i'll try that.
thanks for the help guys, i really appreciate that!
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:55:28


@_date: 2013-11-28 08:15:29
If you are who you pretend to be, first of all a big thank you for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
The history internet pages will thank you forever.
My question is about the future of bitcoin.
What is the next big step? i mean we have exchanges, we have apps and it starts to get mainstream, but when everybody in the world understands bitcoins and starts to use it, what follows next from your point of view?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:22:19
hahaha nice
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:58:20
i have another question regarding this issue. is there maybe a way to send a message to the bitcoin adress? i mean some kind of contact?
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:42:54
i mean the people behind this, its not bitcoin itself fault, its mine personally because i didnt secure the wallet strong enough, but what i mean is that if we want a change for the better than why steal coins from one another.. thats like stealing from everybody because the people loose trust and then dont want to invest.. thats what i mean
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:09:04
ah ok so i cant save the amount on the site? so if i leave the site and have still bitcoins on it im going to loose them if i dont withdraw, is that right?
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:59:57
hehehe nice one^^
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:23:42
i get that, but still, even after a correction of 100 dollar pro btc, i still have a plus and i still can pay the bills.
and I cant imagine right now that bitcoin will fall to a value of 1 dollar pro btc ever again.
can you?
@_date: 2013-03-24 10:32:53
It is a perpetuum mobile
Imagine this:
you store 10 BTC on your wallet, for this 10 BTC you get two bitcoin adresses, one is personal and one adress is global.
Now you place your bets on satoshi dice:
10 BTC gets split like this:
you bet 9 btc on your behalf and 1 btc on the world.
for example you place a bet with 1 btc on less than 64000; then 1 btc on less than 60000 and so on.
the bet gets bundled into one payment with different possibilities:
(satoshi roller does this allready, 1 bundled bet has a cost of 0.005 BTC)
YOUR WALLET                                   WORLD WALLET
dice 97%    1 BTC                              DICE 2%     1 BET      
dice 97%    1 BTC
Dice 84%    1 BTC
and so on 
now satoshi dice gives you your lucky number and you either win or lose.
But when you win you get 90% of the amount of the win into your wallet and 10% goes into the world wallet.
and now comes the interesting part:
you invested 90 % of your 10 BTC in a save bet and 10% in a risky bet
which got bundled into one bet
Imagine your risky bet of 1 BTC gets you like 1940 BTC and 9 BTC gets you like 9,224 BTC
you get the winning split into your two adresses(GLobal 10%, Personal 90%)
of course you yourself dont always win, but the more bets are placed and the more people use it, the higher the possibility that the global adresses get btc.
the goal is this, to fill the global adresses (global wallet) with btc and to fill your personal adress (personal adress) with btc.
however you can withdraw from both and send to both btc.
you could say it would be like having two accounts:
one account is your personal wallet and the other account is the global wallet. and everybody has access to the global account and only you have access to your wallet.
you become a bank only with your smartphone, and imagine billions smartphones included in this process! 
do you get it?
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:33:33
i would like to have a mmorpg android app, where you have a character that can gain levels like in wow, where you chat like in whatsapp and where you can trade goods like in ebay, and every character has a bitcoin wallet and you can play little games against other characters for bitcoins (chess, poker, minipool games) etc. and the more you win the more levels you gain and the more goods you can trade.. something like this would be awesome^^
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:06:31
well i think its for everybody do decide for themselves.
I display everything in mBTC, because as you said it is much more convenient

@_date: 2013-03-31 13:01:27
well i guess this is a hard and bitter first experience with bitcoin...
nevertheless i still believe that its better than traditional banking.
however it still hurts.. because this was like all my money i've got left and invested.. i guess the jokes on me bc i didnt took the necessarly messures to keep my wallet secure..
i wanted to make the two factor authentification but i forgot about it..
now i will never forget it.. 
baahhhh it still sucks tough..
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:14:17
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:17:16
yeah thats the reason why bitcoin will explode. because of the anger of the people with bullshit politicans and bankster criminials!
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:58:45
Well thats the problem guys, you still think that if you leave your money in the actual financ system, with saving accounts and insurences that this money is save.
The only saving account, which is working for me right now, with a 170% gain is a paper wallet!
and that is where i save it right now.
bitcoin is not a bubble, it is the currency basis for all other currencies.
bitcoin is eur, dollar, yen, pln and every other currency.
so no, i dont think that there is a next bubble where i loose 70%
maybe for one day the correction will be a loss of 50% but the next day it still will raise again! thats what i believe and what i see
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:06:06
well i trade on an exchange for profit
but when i see that a crypto currencie is getting pushed i try to learn something about it
its learning by doing, thats how i get things = ) 
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:24:40
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:56:13
i would find a feature quite interesting where you can send some amount on an adress and this adress automatically sends like 10% to another adress in your wallet
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:22:45
not only banking system, im fed up with the government, insurance companies, and anything which has to do with letting someone control your value.
with bitcoin i have everything in my hand, and even if they want to screw me and demand money, i dont have anything left on my accounts and they cant take away my btc, because its safe throught the network.
guys this currency is a game changer and soon enough we will se the effects!
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:19:24
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:32:09
That is really awesome, because today a friend visited me and asked me everything about bitcoin and i sold him his first btc! and now he wants to know more and invest about 5000 eur! 
bitcoin is becoming mainstream!!!
@_date: 2013-10-28 12:59:17
I would like to have a site like 9gag, but where i could tip anybody instantly with a small amount for a good post and also see how much he already got
@_date: 2013-04-26 05:56:48
sorry to hear that. i got the same problem and got robbed 14,8 btc
the most important thing with bitcoin is security, the more paranoid you are the better.
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:15:05
allready doing it bro^^
@_date: 2013-03-25 16:43:35
thats a really good i idea.
i imagine that someday in the future we will even have world accounts where everybody can take the amount they need from the world accounts. how great would that be?
@_date: 2013-04-08 08:52:06
guys its not a bubble! when do you finally get it?
look at the market today, everybody is printing money when they need it, today we have a lot of paper money and electronic money which is floding the economy and bitcoin buys this money and therefore increases in value.
The bubbles are the euro market, usd market, yen market and so on, because they are funny money, not backed up by anything.
on the usd dollar, you can read: in god we trust, but does this mean that you money is secure when inflation hits? no.
but bitcoin has value, i wouldn't even say its a currency, i would say its a value storage place which can be changed into currencies.
in my opinion bitcoin will increase as long the banks and "governments" are printing money, and its value will increase even more until the system realizes that its over and will start using bitcoins as an value of exchange.
So right now we are the lucky winners of a failing economy and until the people realize what bitcoin really is, the rally will go on until every bitcoins value will be about 1 million dollar or eur or yen.
SO NO; ITS NOT A BUBBLE; ITS A REVOLUTION;ITS VALUESTORAGE! 
ITS PLAN B! 
so sit back and relax, because right now we are on our way to become millionairs!
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:27:36
hahahaha, im sorry but thats really funny^^
i mean at last you spend bitcoins and contributed to the bitcoineconomy.
you are the reason why bitcoin is where it is now ; ) 
but i also had 50 bitcoins  early this year. bought them for 40 eur each.
lost most of them on satoshidice or other only casinos.
and 18 bitcoins got stolen.
and for about 4 bitcoins i went to amsterdam.
right now its the most expensive smoke i had in my life^^
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:15:34
way to much on satoshidice....
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:25:35
that is by far the most awesomest thing i have read today!
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:13:25
Well we could start a kickstarter campaign, which would look like:
hey we need 1000 BTC to install 1 ATM in every country = ) 
somebody has to start it, why not reddit/bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2013-04-02 11:47:14
thats it, perfectly said!
@_date: 2013-04-05 12:57:11
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:55:20
Next riddle -
The one who builds it sells it, the one who buys it doesn't need it and the one who gets it doesn't see it.
What is it?
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:03:35
thanks but right now i have a problem, my adress changes if i save the site..how can i fix this?
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:52:16
nice move seriously! i dont know if i would have been moraly able to do that..
@_date: 2013-11-12 13:25:37
well im just thinking if this is possible and if it makes sens, but as im reading more about it, with rising prices i would just loose on this investment.
however selling a flat for bitcoins is another story i guess
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:10:28
cost avarage effect
buy with low price, small portions of btc every time you have money and profit from the increasing market
if you want to invest in bitcoin, do it now, because the sooner the better.
it might look like the price is high, but when bitcoin reaches even higher prices (1000 dollar for example) you will think: ok maybe the 400 dollar wasnt that much
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:34:00
i like the idea, because you could set up for example one adress or one wallet that is only responsible for the recurring payments and only transfer bitcoins to this wallet when YOU want to. 
and you could have other adresses or wallets that are your main sources of holding your bitcoins.
what i generally like about the bitcoin system is, that you can have an unlimited amount of different wallets or adresses, not like in banks that you are responsible and accountable for one account.
i think such a function would be great for people who would like to go into bitcoins but dont want to read all the detailed information.
and if you could go to a branch and just take your savings and transfer them to another "bank" (in this case the bitcoin(account)wallet) people would adapt more quickly
@_date: 2013-04-15 13:49:55
well it would be cool if you could pay your normal bills with a bitcoin wallet:
what i mean is, all the basic features that a normal bank account has like adapted by a btc wallet.
i would like to sent eur amounts to a normal account, and i would like to get eur amounts to a bitcoin wallet and transfer this money into bitcoins.
i dont know if that is possible, but if you could do something like this, i think that would really be a gamechanger
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:26:31
then there is the option with other cryptocurrencies like litecoin
@_date: 2013-03-26 16:14:48
ohh ok sorry! 
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:57:08
Well im not just guessing at all, i am certain that we will hit 1000 dollar per btc and that this mark is not far away.
maybe not by the end of the week but maybe one month.
but you definatly want to know why i am certain, ok:
first: cyprus wasn't just a coincidence, the people got robbed of their money in an oceans eleven style manner, and cyprus was something like the a big silent storage place for big players in the world economy. 
Now even their money got taken and they are pissed! 
now, not only geeks invest money in btc but even the big players find it interesting.
second bitcoin is a value storage place. i wouldnt even say that its a currency. euro, dollar, yen are currencys and bitcoin is their value.
for the people who say bitcoin is a bubble and we will never hit 1000 dollar or more, im going to say this:
EUR, DOLLAR and YEN markets are bubbles, because behind them stands nothing, except the federal reserve bank who prints money like toilet paper. 
what bitcoin does, is buying this currencys and therefore increasing in its value, and because of that its value will raise as long as the banks will print money. so right now we are enjoying the failing of the economy by seeing our value rise. and as long as the banks dont stop with their failing strategy, we will gain even more value.
and i think right now, we are on the tipping point. so maybe my guess isnt the impossible as some people would say = ) 
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:54:57
i was also thinking the same, maybe in near future they will implement this idea.
yeah what you mean is leetcoin.com
@_date: 2013-10-28 10:08:21
well thats what im trying to find out^^
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:05:17
because the banksters stole it haha
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:50:52
hahahaha nice post^^
@_date: 2013-10-28 12:54:24
does something like a public wallet exist? I mean something like the opposite of anonymity, where everybody has access and everybody can put bitcoins on and withdraw them?
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:05:21
yes it is, if you are a starter make sure to secure your wallet with at least a 2-facter authentification, and if you want to store some btc for a longer period of time then use a papperwallet, and this are the first things you have to do.
trust me, i've made a bad experience because i didn't secure my wallet, and now im like 15 btc short...
besides that, it lies in your hands and is not the responsibility of a bank. so be the bank yourself and like they keep your security up ; )
