Free stock trading company to finally get around to providing free options trading, free web based trading, now free crypto trading. Yet all some of you can bicker about is whether or not the million people in line are real people. 
Because that's what matters right now...
Certainly you would be complaining about the same thing if Fidelity or TD Ameritrade started offering crypto at $10 a trade.
A million users?? BAH, FAKE!

Avoid ANY USDT based exchange. Stick with Gemini!

I don't think they have charts that you can scale through, though you can enter 'mined' coins, or related in your case, and it will calculate those with the assumption of additional income and not capital gains rates. 
I was able to separately calculate my capital vs mined, if that also answers your question.

Robinhood just sent them their Cease &amp; Desist. 
Also free of charge.

Not trying to say "just pay this site to do it for you".
But if you trade as much as I did in 2017, then it will save you about 3 weeks of work.

This guy came all the way to r/bitcoin to laugh at us and joke about us 'nerds' never leaving our parents basements. 
Doesn't get any better than that! 
It's painfully obvious he's already lost in crypto, or has no clue how to get started.
