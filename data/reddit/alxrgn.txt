How is this a huge drop? £8.1 yesterday to £7.5k today, stop panicking.

You're on a cryptocurrency subreddit, what were you expecting?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:32:46
why sell during a dip?

I had a small amount &lt;£10 in ethereum, bought a few months ago after I verified my bank account. Had a look the other day and there is no ETH balance or any trace of the transaction - wouldn’t hold anything on there

What is your calculation? You think 70-80% of BBT viewers would buy bitcoin after watching one episode focused on it? 20% at an absolute maximum.

Don't repeat what you've just read on twitter...

������ this is my exact position rn, wanna pay off my credit cards with my bitcoin gains, but what if it moons when I cash out?!?

Well I don't deal in any of those currencies so it makes no difference to me.

Absolutely no idea - I was very tempted to sell at £5k a few weeks ago but I didn't and it paid off massively, I'll most likely leave it and see where it goes.

3 hours later, yes.

Why would anyone listen to a 2 second superbowl ad that says 'buy bitcoin'?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:21:17
It was at 7.9, why would I post saying it's approaching £8k if it was already there? I would've posted 'Bitcoin surpasses £8k GBP'.

On Linkedin last week, saw one of my connections comment on a post about buying 'packs' of bitcoin, apparently if you buy 1 pack of bitcoin today, you'll have over £1M in a years time!!
