Thanks! Noob questions though, I have Qt wallet on my computer. Do I just generate a new address that is not on Blockchain.info and send it there or do I need to start an entirely new wallet?

If I generate another address and send my coins there will it essentially remove the encryption?

Buy btc. Move to another exchange or sell locally.

Im not sure Multibit can load the .dat file. Is it easy to delete the wallet from blockchain.info?

Uh this guy ran away from authorities in Belize and he is accused of murder there I think. Let's just listen when he says positive things about BTC

Dear BestBuy, I made a lot of money in BTC in the last 6 months. I would happily spend one or two on some shit I don't actually need in you store.

Same here. 'Internal News Sources' makes it sound like he talking about a team of analysts or something. He also mentions day trading. If he has a big boy wallstreet job, there is no reason he is day trading. If he is a pro day trader, he isn't working for a big firm and he should damn know what a Bloomberg Terminal is.

Cool! Thanks! I made my password a year ago and I have been irrationally worrying about if it still worked. Thank god it does.

I'm smelling some BS with OP by the way. ALL of wallstreet uses Bloomberg. More so than reuters. He doesn't mention this at all. Wallstreet doesn't take day traders seriously.

Yeah, bitcoin is perfect for platforms like that. 
I don't know if it is best for GGG though. Banks and credit card processors are able to convert the many currencies they would be receiving into New Zealand Dollars. I don't know if there are any exchanges that would take their BTC and Covert it directly to their currency. They will need banking services no matter what.
