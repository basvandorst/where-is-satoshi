Out of curiousity doesn't the concept of a satoshi drastically increase the money supply? If bitcoin continued to rise into some insane number (hypothetically) like $10,000,000 per bitcoin. Doesnt that now mean a satoshi is actually worth something? Therefore you kind of do the opposite of making larger bills, you instead just make smaller ones.
In fiat there is a limit on how small you can go currency wise. However is that different with bitcoin? Especially if lightning network adds things like millisatoshis?

Now that you have announced you have access to over $30,000 in BTC. You might want to take additional steps to 2FA your email accounts associated with the exchanges. Also watch out for weird messages wanting weird info.
(Unless its in a wallet, then goodluck investing)

Unpopular opinion but...
Delisting coins is a terrible way to grow the ecosystem, no matter how "bad" the projects are.

The same way that not allowing a movie to be played at movie theaters isn't "banning". There is no way to "ban" it but you can certainly kill it.
Binance and other groups are taking these weird positions against BSV but aren't taking action against the multitude of other far more shady coins. Seems unfair to me.

Its an attempt to drum up anger to promote his shitcoin, don't even give him a second thought. The entire coin is a scam. Should be reported for fraud.
