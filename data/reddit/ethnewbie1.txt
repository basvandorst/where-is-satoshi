Happy groundhog day :)

Ah, don't bother, it's because of the groundhog day

So if I hold a long position, will I get BTU both for collateral BTC and borrowed BTC?
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:48:55
Or it was an inside trade.

If you want to know how to deal with miners watch Star Trek season 1, episode 6.

The whole point of bitcoin is to bring together retarded people and spread retardedness. Just follow the wave.

For empty blocks the only variable part is nonce, which is 32 bit, so only ~4 billion combinations. With current difficulty it's less than required to 100% mine a block. So don't worry, with difficulty growth empty blocks will become more rare.

It still sucks some BTC supply (BTC holders willing to sell at risk), so it drives price up on other exchanges too.

If this discredits the movement, it will (and should) be done by those who opposes it.

They are not needed even on a sidechain. They introduce too much potential risk.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:15:28
Does it mean that millions of people are now figuring out how to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:09:31
Miner fees will boost GDP though...

Bad way to ruin a marriage.

The only way to tell miners we really want to change bitcoin is to sell all our bitcoins. Let's collectively sell bitcoins (all at once) in the beginning of difficulty adjustment cycle. The price will crash and the miners will learn that it's economically bad to go against progress (aka SegWit).

No price for bitcoin is too high.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:09:48
My comment is the only sensible comment in this thread (if you're capable to think logically).
Assume P is the price of bitcoin, G is gain per block (coinbase reward + fees), H - hash rate (hashes required to mine a block at current difficulty), E - price of electricity per hash.
Miners altogether get P×G per block, and have to pay H×E for electricity. 
Profit = P×G - H×E
If overall profit is too high, there is always room for other miners to join and increase hash rate. If profit is negative, least efficient miners have to leave. This dynamic process makes the profit low and should always converge to the same value regardless of P, G, H, E values.
So, for miners it doesn't matter what grows: P or G, they care about profit.

Ethereum blockchain is bigger and we must all admit, it is going to overtake bitcoin inevitably.
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:45:18
$1 = 670 bits, we are still good
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:12:33
Miner's profit margin will always be the same (because they compete with each other). So they really don't care. Maybe more biased against the change.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:40:56
Ethereum pumpers just make BTC more fairly distributed, and they make ETH less fairly distributed.

1 bit = 0.2 cents
bitcoin is still a pennystock
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:43:22
Well, if you're that paranoid don't forget about RNG attack. Are you sure entropy was not compromised when you generated your wallet?
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:38:02
Another risk is that Ethereum price is very clearly manipulated. If they prove there've been any kind of conspiracy between the devs and the manipulator, they'll all end up in jail.

When we have the same amount of women as men in bitcoin, then I know we reached the top.

Also, your offline computer's random number generator can be seeded from a known small set of seeds.

Bitcoin is dead.

mBTC = 1000 bits = 1 kb
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:11:53
And pay 1000% fees?
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:52:37
You people can't agree on a simple scaling solution. Now Vitalik is going to rule y'all. How about that?
@_date: 2017-05-20 21:54:12
No, when 1 satoshi = $1, then it's not a pennystock anymore :)
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:54:29
Right, that's why we have ETC.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:36:59
Bitcoin community will never agree on anything.
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:56:26
Only if there are no replies like this :)

Tough ladder to climb. Not everybody's jaw will survive till the end. I personally am stocking with anti-jaw-dropping meds right now....
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:00:06
Well, if the devs conspired with some big BTC holder(s) who helped them pump ETH and otherwise assisted in the manipulation, it's clearly illegal. I'm personally ok, but I'm sure there are a lot of pissed people out there who have very serious questions about DAO fork and other things, such as the timing of switch to PoS.
How would one prove that? That's a multi-billion question now :)
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:39:39
The other side of what? :)
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:21:13
Do you mean HEDL?

C'mon, nobody needs smart contracts. It's a waste of blockchain space.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:25:44
Millibit is a wrong term to use here. 1 bit = 0.000001 BTC, so 1 millibit would be 1/1000 of that.
Correct synonym for mBTC is kbit = 1000 bits.
