Hi There READSOMEBOOKS!
I am one of the managers at Crypto X Change, what are you trying to spread rubbish for? I have seen some where else that you say BitcoinMedia owns the Exchange, this is totally incorrect. We have BitcoinMedia doing some media work for the Exchange, that is why you find BitcoinMedia posting links for and about the Exchange. Also, BitcoinMedia is from Australia, we are also based in Australia if you had actually looked into the information  provided by our company in regards to the Company that owns the Exchange. I find it quite offensive that people like you go around making false accusations about any business in which you have absolutely no idea about. BitcoinMedia is contacted to our company for marketing, and is no way related to Crypto X Change or our company.
