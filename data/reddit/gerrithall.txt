Have you met Beepi?

Thanks.  send $1.50 -- you can use it on Bithub if you're so inspired ;)

FWIW, I'm building [Bithub]( a project to reward repository project contributors with colored coins.  
We considered using Colu, but we ended up only using the Coinprism API, along with Blockr and BlockCypher to verify transactions.
I believe open assets are the killer use case for Bitcoin, and I look forward to seeing the ecosystem evolve.

Thanks!  send a cookie :)

Great question.  We're keeping it simple and not counting number of commits, just whether or not a commit was made.
- send 'em the last cookie

Right now our focus is just on issuing the asset and then dividing it fairly among project contributors.
The asset is issued using Coinprism, which already provides [many amazing features]( for managing colored coins.  Smart project teams could decide upfront how to utilize these assets, even implementing it into the DNA of the project.  Or, if the project stalls, developers can always uncolor the coins to recover the raw value.
Does this answer your question?

The Fold team does a great job of building a simple and beautiful app.  Every time I've used Fold it's been as simple as just pulling out my phone and paying.
Like the other posters, I read this post as them hammering out a few bugs that made the experience confusing in a few edge cases.  Keep up the great work!

The Boost team accepts both bitcoin and blockchain founders.  With nearly a hundred investments in the bitcoin space, they have a nuanced understanding of the industry and the strongest network of Bitcoin startups of anybody.

Q: What is the boost.vc investment thesis for the blockchain space
A: I will explain it for both Bitcoin and block chain
There are 3 things Bitcoin does better than the current system:
- Store of Value
- Microtransactions
- Cross boarder transfer
These three categories make up all of the investments we have made in the space to date.
For block chain:
- Smart Contracts
- Digitizing assets
- Certification of things on the block chain
These 3 represent all block chain companies we invest in.
