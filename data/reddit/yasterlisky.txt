Looks like ham adheres to a classic bubble cycle

I guess that was the day they halted withdrawals -

I feel you - definitely had my share of ribbing, but more and more the people I talk to are curious instead of prone to poke fun

Did it, very quickly and roughly though.
* On Feb. 6, 1:24pm, 638,679 bitcoins transferred to dozens of wallets on the same second  
* At 2:05pm, about 610,000 bitcoins transferred on the same second  
* At 2:08pm, another 100,000  
* At 2:12pm, another 70,000  
Conspiracy away!! I have no idea how to post this to the bitcoin subreddit if anyone wants to have fun with this. I = nub

I thought about trying to solve the mystery of Feb. 6:  (sort by "Last Transaction In" and look at the multitude of txns done all at the same exact time on Feb. 6). I thought, conspiracy theory-wise, I would add it up to see if it hit ~750,000 as reported in that Gox report, but hopefully someone else has already done this and one of you all could post a link so I could sleeps

I put this up in a late night thread a few days ago but I'm reposting here to see if anyone wants to take up the mantle of investigating further - I noticed the article didn't mention it but I find the following transactions on Feb. 6th suspicious (not necessarily related to the Gox debacle, simply suspicious because it involves, if you count the separate transactions, well over a million coins moving in a matter of hours at exact time points, and on the day Gox halted withdrawals, at that); unfortunately I don't have the wherewithal to truly give it any more attention (licking save the date envelopes and finding a florist -  a wedding like a beast).
I dub it the mystery of Feb. 6, go to:    &amp; then sort by "Last Transaction In" and look at the multitude of txns done all at the same exact time on Feb. 6. Sometimes the amounts are exactly the same. The list may have changed since a few days ago but everything I accounted for below took place on the first two pages.
*On Feb. 6, 1:24pm, 638,679 bitcoins transferred to dozens of wallets on the same second  
*At 2:05pm, about 610,000 bitcoins transferred on the same second  
*At 2:08pm, another 100,000  
*At 2:12pm, another 70,000  
This article shows the day they halted withdrawals was Feb. 6, though someone here might be able to correct me: 
Edit: I admit some misunderstanding here - the second column appears to be the final balance, not the amount necessarily transacted on that day. I checked a few individually, though, and for every one I checked, the address got the bulk (99%) of its balance on Feb. 6. This diluted my suspicion with confusion, because it seems some of these addresses had one or more entries in the months prior (perhaps lining up with events on the OP's timeline?). I'm not really into conspiracy theory, but I think this whole course of events is interesting, and if the above transactions have anything to do with it, I'd be happy to have contributed to helping people who may have lost money find their way to recouping what they lost. And now I think I have to turn away before I go down the rabbit hole any further.
