[Context]( with regard to "Bitcoin does not have source addresses at all."
@_date: 2016-04-23 04:08:18
"Source" addresses are a bit more complicated than I'll go into here, but in general one can determine from where the bitcoins came in a transaction. For example, see the transaction [here.]( You can see that on the left hand side is the "input" side of the transaction, and on the right hand side are the "outputs" of the transaction. That said, unless the person looking at the transaction knows who "owns" the source address, they won't know who sent the bitcoin.
There are various bitcoin mixing services, such as coinjoin, and lots of darknet services, however I won't recommend any of them. Coinjoin implementations have had privacy concerns in the past, and darknet services have been known to be scams.
Be careful!

There's not a ton of discussion on this topic, but you are a bit late to the party:
* [Proof Of Existence]( has been around for a while. The developer has been active on this sub, not sure if he is anymore. Problems include: service uses a method which creates unspendable outputs (blockchain bloat, and bitcoin lost forever), and anybody that may want to use this service can easily do it themselves without a service fee (not 100% sure a fee is still charged by developer).
* [Here's a post I made]( about a method of creating "self-serve colored coins." I'd be happy to discuss it in any sort of detail if you're interested. I've done quite a bit of thinking about the subject.
Right now it appears as if the Mastercoin project is on the forefront of storing data in the blockchain that is not inherent in a bitcoin transaction. The application is quite a bit different than proving something happened at a specific time, however some of the concepts may be applicable. Regardless, the methods that the Mastercoin project are using to store data have been developed with the specific intent to reduce blockchain bloat, and it's my understanding that the Mastercoin developers have been in cahoots with the Bitcoin developers to come to some sort of agreement.
Regarding blockchain bloat, it seems you have a small misunderstanding of what sort of bloat is "okay" vs "not okay." While it's not ideal to generate a large number of transactions that's purpose is not directly to move bitcoin from one address to another, it's significantly less damaging than using a method of data storage like Proof Of Existence. The key here is that Proof Of Existence creates unspendable outputs, which not only destroys bitcoin, but requires that every copy of the blockchain, forever, carry the weight of proof of someone's document. In comparison, other methods create outputs that are able to be spent, and thus are possible to later be pruned from the blockchain.
What this all comes down to is the ability to reasonably prove that something happened or existed at a certain date and time. You may be able to convince the crypto community that your song existed at a certain point in time, but what hoops would you have to jump through for this to be legally recognized?
In order for a hash stored in a bitcoin transaction to be legally recognized as proof that a song existed, I'd expect that some authority would have to 1.) recognize a transaction as an irreversible movement of value that requires consent from the sender, 2.) recognize that the hash of a file is unique, and is representative of the data from which it was created.
The largest challenge is implementation on multiple levels:
* Platform: Bitcoin has the benefit of being the most secure and widely recognized - however requires data storage outside of the blockchain in order to validate, and implementation can get interesting. Namecoin is technically a much better suited platform to take on this challenge. Namecoin has it's problems too though. The network isn't as secure, it's much less widely known, there's significantly less development, and the primary focus is on distributed DNS. Further, all claims expire in ~250 days, which depending on the application may be beneficial I suppose.
* Protocol: It'd be a challenge for anybody to recognize a transaction as proof of the existence of a document/song/whatever if that transaction doesn't follow rules as outlined by some protocol. The development of a protocol allows standardization, definitions, and acceptable practices, as well as a reference for how to look up items that have previously been proven to exist. Namecoin has a significant leg up here, as one could designate (for example) "proof/" as the prefix for a primary key that is to be used to store a hash, and various fields can be defined to further define the protocol or associate the data with an identity. A protocol designed to function on top of the bitcoin blockchain must be designed very differently, and must work around issues of data storage, external validation, bloat, and what constitutes proof in a system that isn't designed to carry this sort of data.
* Incentive: There's simply little incentive to establish a system that functions as proof of existence. Legal recognition is a long shot, and any party that finds their data important enough to prove existed at a certain time won't use the blockchain. Beyond this, while bitcoin is gaining mainstream awareness, it's still a fringe technology, and the deep understanding required to either store data in a blockchain or verify data stored in the blockchain marks a high cost of entrance. The first step I believe is the monetization of a service which has previously defined a protocol. I'm not proposing an authority that is used to validate items that have been proved to exist, but a service that handles the details. That is, an interface that can be securely used for an individual to independently put his data in the blockchain - without a compromise security or privacy, can be externally verified, and takes all of the "technical" legwork away from the end user. But where does that leave us? There's a place where Joe Blow can store proof of the damage in his apartment on move-in date.
The concept is fascinating. But there isn't nearly enough desire for a decentralized, trustless, public proof of existence system to warrant legal recognition and potential replacement of existing and recognized systems/services.
EDIT: I believe the potential is there, but likely as a "feature" of a protocol layer with a significantly larger scope. For example, digital rights management can be very valuable to media distributors. The monetization of a service that can grant legal rights to digital content via the blockchain establishes a legal precedent of "ownership" through distributed cryptography. From here it's trivial to use this precedent to prove existence of some data.
EDIT 2: The mostly unspoken goldmine here is recognition of identity via blockchain. Imagine a protocol layer that establishes a method of PGP/GPG-esque identification, and integration with an HD wallet that can adequately protect an entity's financial privacy. With the ability to "revoke" certificates, and maintain privacy and security, a groundwork can be made for not only proving that a document existed, but for internet authentication, license management, etc. 
Anyway, I'm obviously thinking about this too much. Ideas are a dime a dozen, and my day job limits my ability to pursue these ideas as much as I desire. Hope my thoughts are useful to somebody.

I don't think I'm understanding how you're implementing green addresses. Do you mind going into a bit more detail, or pointing me to another resource?
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:55:51
It depends on the transaction specifics.
If you have 2 bitcoin in address A and 1 bitcoin in address B you have a total of 3 bitcoin. Say you're buying a TV for 0.5 bitcoin. The wallet would choose one of the addresses to send from and return any change to a brand new unused address.
Now let's say that at the last second you decided to go for a major upgrade, a TV costing 2.5 bitcoin. The wallet would use both addresses A and B because neither one of the addresses individually could cover the entire quantity to be transacted. Any change would be returned to a brand new unused address.
In the first scenario addresses A and B aren't associated with each other. In the second scenario one can determine that the person who owns the bitcoin in address A also owns the bitcoin in address B and vice versa. So that answers your question you can't forget about change.
Let's pretend that you went ahead and purchased the 0.5 bitcoin TV. Address A still has a balance of 2 bitcoin, address B now has 0 bitcoin, and address C, your change address, has a balance of 0.4999 bitcoin. (the missing 0.0001 bitcoin was used as a transaction fee for the TV transaction).
Now you want to buy a new fridge that's priced at 2.1 bitcoin. This time instead of combining the bitcoin from addresses A and B, you're going to use the bitcoin from addresses A and C, and the change will be sent to a brand new unused address. In this manner addresses A and C are associated with each other, and by address Cs association with address B, address A can now be associated with address B.

Last year both BTC.co and bitfunder were shut down. There may have been others. Anyway, people lost money. 
Colored coins and other protocol layers can provide a means to distribute shares of an asset as well as to trade those shares. A decentralized exchange can't be shut down unless the issuers and shareholders and brought down individually. 
There's also a lot if interest in smart property. For example, think about replacing your house keys with a bitcoin "key." You can issue and revoke keys at will and breaking the lock is as challenging as acquiring Satoshi's untouched fortunes.

@_date: 2014-05-06 09:25:33
One problem with a method such as this is the increase in fee for the sender and receiver. Not only does each input/output in a transaction increase the size of that transaction, but smaller output have lower priority and therefore cost more to send.

@_date: 2014-08-09 23:37:44
Not only would this complicate the IBLT building and decoding process (and require more storage space), but it opens the network up to an attack that's rather trivial to execute.
Say you have 15 bitcoins split up into 50,000 UTXOs (each of 0.0003 BTC) in your wallet. You create 50,000 unsigned transactions, each of which spends one of the UTXOs to some address that you control. Once you have this all set up you sign all transactions and then create a list including the address, the first 6 bytes (48 bits) of the txid of each one, along with the associated signature.
Let's say that you do this until you have enough signatures such that you can spend 10,000 of the UTXOs in transactions which have a TXID with the same 6 bytes. Broadcast all of those transactions.
Now your attack is as simple as spending those 10,000 UTXOs ~simultaneously, each of which has a prevOut txid of the same 6 byte prefix.
Say we have a block that includes n colliding transactions. Worst case scenario, 2^n different combinations must be tested to match the Merkle root, with an average of 2^(n-1).
If n is small, the effect may be trivial, however for larger values of n, the time required to verify the block can grind the network to a halt. This is also not an optimized attack method - an attacker could be more successful by increasing the fee included in each transaction. 
The worst scenario, however, is a malicious miner that performs this attack. Say the miner includes 1,000 transactions in a block that he mines with the same 6 byte prefix. While the rest of the network works on the 2^1,000 different possible combinations, the malicious miner proceeds to continue mining blocks.

One advantage is that private keys used for authentication can easily "piggy back" on all of the infrastructure in place that people use to keep their bitcoin private keys safe.

Both MSC and XCP are interoperable with Bitcoin or neither are.
Whether they are or not depends on how interoperability is defined. It's possible to trade MSC/XCP with BTC, but the mechanisms by which that happens are leagues from matching the functionality provided by colored coin atomic swaps (as well as significantly riskier) or a centralized exchange.
I'd say that the degree to which MSC/XCP are interoperable with BTC is significantly less than that of colored coins.

The order in which they're added to the block doesn't affect *which* transactions are included. The miner still decides which are added, according to priority and fee/size (presumably).


It looks like Gavin is sorting by the value of the txid + index, where 0 repeating would be first and f repeating would be last

My experience when testing it:
* Wallet requires 6 confirmations before allowing an a deposit to be spent.
* Social integration doesn't function in Chrome app.
* 2FA doesn't work with my phone - had to resort to email 2FA.
* I have 0.6926mBTC in my wallet because it would not allow me to drain the complete amount (that's what the option for recipient to pay fee is for!)
* nlocktime function is pretty cool, but I don't want to have to rely on their service in order to actually recover the bitcoin.
* The green address is not implemented as traditionally defined (uses the message of the payment protocol).
* "Instant payments" require the receiving party be able to receive the "green message" and recognize that message as trustworthy.
* In order to guarantee access to bitcoin held in wallet, user must carry passphrase on person (because pin is deleted after 3 wrong attempts)
* Though they boast that the wallet is BIP32, it functions as just a regular deterministic wallet. No account control.
* The implementation of multisig in effect is very similar to a blockchain.info wallet's client side encryption, and has more restrictions on how funds can be recovered.

Sure, possible, but sharing a private key can be a lot closer to sharing your Steam credentials than a CD key. But either way, it's easy to work around.
If a private key is an "identity," then no user would want to share it. If a private key only provides access to play some game, then simply restrict the number of downloads or simultaneous users.

A quantity of colored coins is represented by a UTXO. The inclusion of that UTXO in a transaction (that eventually gets confirmed) guarantees that those colored coins are spent - because that UTXO can only be included in the blockchain once.
With XCP, the amount of coins that an address owns has nothing to do with the UTXO that it can spent. In fact an address can have plenty of XCP but 0 BTC!
Micropayment channels require that payment can be guaranteed by spending a specific UTXO. XCP simply cannot do this.
EDIT: UXTO -&gt; UTXO

One can use a bitcoin address to sign a message. Another person can verify that the message was signed by that address.
You can think of it like your signature that you use. When you, for example, sign a funds transfer slip at the bank you're authorizing the movement of that money as specified by the slip.
is saying that a user can sign a message that states, "withdraw 1.2BTC to address 1AbCdEf....." The exchange can then verify that the message was signed by the user who the BTC belongs to, and that the movement is therefore authorized.
implies that signing a message is better than some other 2FA methods because 1.) there is explicit and provable intent with each message signing, and 2.) it doesn't require sharing any sensitive information over the internet - ever.
prefers a similar authentication method to the OP called SQRL. SQRL still uses public keys, however is significantly faster than the equivalent action in BitID. Authentication methods that don't use public key encryption are faster than both BitID and SQRL, however the speed comes at the cost of security.
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:49:30
I've been thinking about this more, and there isn't necessarily a threshold to which miners must adhere.
Once the threshold is breached, the contents of the IBLT can't be listed and the lookup operation (i.e. return value y corresponding to index x) is less likely to succeed.
However, we know how many transactions are in a block, and we know what the index numbers are of every single entry - so even if some lookup operations fail, we should still be able to go through the list, obtain the txids of the indices that succeed, and then delete that index from the IBLT. If we can do this until the number of entries drops below the threshold, it should be trivial to list the remaining indices and corresponding txid.
Sorry to mislead you :) It's more computationally expensive this way - but still possible.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:37:40


If we were to provide instant confirmation for all users at all time the users will have impractical 6 confirms waiting for all transactions (including change) and, depending on the implementation, they may lose on privacy.
It wasn't previously clear to me that you required 6 confirmations on the deposits only in the scenario in which you sign the outgoing transaction with the "green address." When you say "instant confirmation," you imply that the transaction will instantly be included in a block. Not possible. Misleading. Sure, some party may treat it as confirmed if it's signed. The website does not make clear the conditions in which the recipient will treat an unconfirmed tx as confirmed.


It's not my intention to bitch, but there was no dust.


Awesome, great. Don't tell me. Put it on your website. Define your implementation of the green address, so others know that it is not the implementation referenced in the FAQ, and outline the circumstances under which a recipient will treat an unconfirmed tx as confirmed.


You are addressing items I did not bring up.


Just read the BIP32 specification. I want sub accounts/wallets that are part of the "master" tree.


"Instant confirmation," "green address," "BIP0032 HD Wallet"


Okay. The frustrations I had, as previously described, did not make me feel like a was using a product that had completed testing, or was finished.

A merchant can consider membership as implied by payment. Since all transactions are publicly available the merchant does not have to have the hardware, software, development and maintenance that comes along with keeping a database. The benefit is free and reliable data storage.
The biggest benefit, however, trumps free data storage. The implication of using a bitcoin private key to validate users (i.e. sign a message) is that the authentication process is as secure as bitcoin itself. Think about it, a users credentials cannot reasonably be brute forced, the server doesn't store any sensitive data, and the user doesn't have to broadcast any sensitive data at all.
You bring up some valid points concerning the challenges of managing private keys for authentication. But I can't help but think that we should be exploring reasons to pursue more secure authentication methods instead of making excuses why it may be difficult.
Anyway, consider the possibility that some online bitcoin wallet, like Coinbase, enables authentication via message signing. So you scan the QR with your dumb-phone (or type in a link) and SMS it to Coinbase. Coinbase then sends the signed message to the merchant who then grants you access to whatever service they may provide.
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:21:51
Close, but not completely correct.
Any OP_RETURN output is unspendable (and thus prune-able), however it's not required to have a value of 0 BTC. Sending bitcoin to an OP_RETURN output destroys the bitcoin.

Interface is still present on the app. Am I missing something?


We are looking to add more in this area once we finish work on the payment protocol.
I understand how it's supposed to work, but the wallet wouldn't allow me to withdraw the quantity that it said I had (which also had consensus with blockchain.info).


Thanks, I was incorrect here.


The terminology you've been using is misrepresentative of the service provided. The functionality you are describing is not recognized (to my knowledge, please correct me if I'm wrong), greenaddress.it has not established a trustworthy reputation, and to advertise "instant confirmation" is a blatant misrepresentation of the experience the user will have. If I'm wrong here, please provide both services who's green address greenaddress.it recognizes, and services which recognize greenaddress.it's green address.


Well sure, because it's not possible anyway. But for the sake of argument, there are no circumstances in which I would prefer to have a bitcoin transaction confirm "soon" or "later" rather than "instantly."


We could allow the user to do so but is completely against our principles and as I said above it would be immediately detectable.
Okay, so we've taken care of the already negligible risk of a double spend. Does greenaddress.it guarantee that the transaction is "standard," has a large enough fee, and is sufficiently broadcast to the network? Double spend isn't the only risk in accepting a 0 confirmation payment. Like I said, greenaddress.it has no established track record, and nobody would consider a 0 confirmation tx as confirmed because it's signed by greenaddress.it.


[BIP32]( There is no heirarchy, no accounts, no wallets. It's just an array of addresses. I know that with the social functions a master public key can be generated, however this can also be done with Electrum or Armory. It's a feature, yes, but your wallet does not provide the functionality as outlined by BIP32.
What it comes down to is that I'm very critical of bitcoin services. The service you're providing is misleading, and my shaky experiences so far have left me in doubt. All I see are "features!" with no utility to back them up. Like I said, the nlocktime thing is pretty cool, however it's a major inconvenience in comparison to the competition, blockchain.info, without providing any benefit.
greenaddress.it is innovative, but half of the features are misleading fluff. If you want to stand out:
* Implement the HD part of BIP32
* Stop being misleading
* Launch the product when it's ready
* Realize that bugs like failed 2FA, being unable to withdraw funds, and incomplete/unfinished interfaces can be a major damper on first impressions

This problem only happens when the total output of the transaction is too small. That's why I set the value of 1 lol at 6000 satoshis. If the output is too small the bitcoind server rejects it, and ChromaWallet is unable to find the txid that it thinks should be there.
You can get the wallet seed in plantext from the mainnet.wallet file, however I'm not positive how to generate the correct lol address from it. It looks like it generates the same bitcoin address every time though.

You can ask the exact same questions about bitcoin, all alt coins, and frankly any representation of rights or ownership.
The answer comes down to trust and track record. It'd be awesome if one could provide cryptographic proof of trustworthiness, unfortunately I'm not aware of any projects that are pursuing this.
I think the key is to use the blockchain to store the "color" of the coins in question. Though there are multiple colored coin clients (in beta or pre beta) none of them store the color in the blockchain. I know "color" isn't very clear so if you'll allow me...
A properly executed colored coin issuance should have 2 "features:"
1. The complete description of the colored coin should be stored in the blockchain, and should be publicly accessible. This can be as simple as drawing up a contract, taking the hash of that contract and storing in in the blockchain via OP_RETURN in the transaction that issues colored coins. This allows irrefutable evidence that a token holds the properties as described by some specific transaction.
2. The "color" should designate some person or entity liable or responsible. e.g. Sign the contract with PGP and include a link to a twitter post by the authoring party.

Congratulations on releasing some awesome software. Also, congratulations on releasing a distributed exchange just days before Mastercoin. I know I should be careful with my words since you don't consider it safe for mainnet, but I already tried it out and I didn't break anything!
I was one of the guinea pigs that was testing the first (real) bitcoin to (real) mastercoin distributed trades back in mid November. It was really exciting to be a part of that, however it's it seems clear to me now that colored coin has some very visible advantages over mastercoin. Namely verification via bitcoin transactions as opposed to properly parsing the blockchain. It's not my intent to compare my experiences with mastercoin vs colored coin, I'm just very giddy with ChromaWallet.

This is pretty incredible. For anybody interested, here's a quick rundown of what this is, and why it's important.
- Inverted Bloom lookup tables (IBLTs) are a modification to the Bloom filters e.g. used in SPV clients.
- IBLTs store key pairs e.g. (x, y)
- IBLTs are designed to have a threshold
- As long as the number of elements in the IBLT doesn't exceed the threshold, the contents of the IBLT can be listed (with a high probability of success).
- The size of the IBLT scales linearly to the threshold, rather than the number of elements stored in the IBLT.
We assume that we're going to be storing indices and txids, (index, txid). The threshold of the IBLT we can say is some value of transactions that is the rough equivalent of a 1 MB block.
If we give the miners an additional requirement that they must include an IBLT in the block header, we can also require that we can deterministically use the IBLT to list all key pairs, (index, txid), included in that block without failure.
Thus, we can broadcast block headers of a fixed size, that represent a variable number of transactions, while including all the leaf nodes (txids) necessary to calculate and verify the Merkle root of the block.
Not only does this encourage miners to include more transactions (up to the ~threshold), but it also encourages them to relay transactions - because the block cannot be completely verified unless the full transactions are known. So, by ensuring that other nodes have the same transactions in the mempool, you're actually more likely to win a race condition.
I should note that this is just speculation on how Gavin intends to implement IBLTs - kind of doubting the key pair is (txid,txData) though.
EDIT: This is all actually wrong :)

The concept behind colored coin is to associate data with a bitcoin transaction that isn't "built in" to the protocol.
ChromaWallet is a bitcoin wallet that allows the user to properly manage the coins that have been "colored."
The wallet allowed me to issue an asset called "lol." The wallet is just coloring bitcoins that already exist.
By sending you some bitcoin that have been colored by the ChromaWallet and are recognized as the asset "lol" I'm not only sending you bitcoin, but whatever is represented by the color of those coins.
In this case, the asset "lol" is meaningless - I just want to play around with colored coins. 
However, it'd be possible for one to issue stock to stockholders using this method. There are countless possibilities really.

Edit: to be clear, m of n and multisig describe the same thing: an output that is spendable with the sigs of m of n private keys.

Blockchain.info marks irregular transaction outputs as 'unable to decode output address' - typically when the output is not to a 'regular' bitcoin address. Frequently outputs that are marked in this way are OP_RETURN outputs. OP_RETURN is a method by which one can embed 40 (or 80?) bytes of data in a bitcoin transaction.
The transaction you linked has an OP_RETURN output. A bit of further investigation reveals that the transaction is associated with Omni (formerly Mastercoin), which is a protocol layer 'on top' of bitcoin, though uses a different native currency.
There are other types of outputs that blockchain.info would mark as 'unable to decode output address,' but OP_RETURN is one of the major ones.
It may be informative to ask, 'what types of outputs can/will blockchain.info decode in human readable form?' rather than which types they won't, as the types of outputs they will decode will likely always be fewer than the possible output types.

Authy is not offline. You can give it Gauth tokens, however those tokens are uploaded to Authy servers, and can be accessed by anybody that has access to your phone number. i.e. the attacker forwards your calls. They install Authy on their phone. All Authy requires in order to sync all your 2fa is an SMS, which the attacker has access to because they forwarded your calls.
Authy also provides SMS 2fa for people who don't want to install the app.
It's a tradeoff - security for convenience.
@_date: 2017-01-09 04:01:03
One of the main issues with Authy is that it ties all of your 2fa codes to your phone number. There's been a recent surge in people social engineering cell phone service providers to forward and/or port to another VOIP/device. Once this happens, the attacker has access to all of your 2fa codes. Gauth is more secure than Authy, and thus a preferable choice if you care about your security.

decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested
in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the
fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to
redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the
work of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up
diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added
The context of Satoshi discussing the chain with most work is clearly in relation to a 51% attack. The implication of this is that the chain with most work only matters among chains that follow the same consensus rules. The hashrate associated with a forked chain doesn't matter because they don't need to perform a 51% attack in order to change _literally anything_ about bitcoin and its transaction history.

It's not really possible to know the answer to this. People can make estimates e.g. if a UTXO hasn't been spent in x years, consider it lost. But this obviously doesn't account for coins lost in the last x years, and more importantly, there's no real evidence that coins x years old are actually lost.
We can look at the question in a different way though. How many coins can we definitely prove are lost forever i.e. unspendable? To answer this, we can look at the blockchain and sum up all 
* UTXOs that are OP_RETURN outputs, 
* all bitcoins that _cannot_ have an associated private key [(here)]( and 
* all bitcoins sent to addresses where there's a very high chance that nobody knows the associated private key, and nobody ever will [(I think this is an example. See the original mastercoin whitepaper)](
* this list probably isn't exhaustive

The core developers aren't all of the same mind, so some may continue to maintain the code base for the old fork. But it's likely that most of the core developers (and the rest of the community) would want the old chain to die.


Philosophical or political reasons. Some people think that there's an unspoken agreement or contract that bitcoin will fundamentally stay the same. Typically this agreement is invoked when discussing changes such as changing the number of bitcoins (e.g. from 21 million to some other value) or making bitcoin inflationary. These massive changes are subversive because they change what bitcoin means at a fundamental level - bitcoin is no longer what people bought in to. So instead of going along with the hard fork, they may stick with the old chain - which of course excludes all the updates that they find unsavory.
The examples I used are pretty extreme (number of bitcoins and changing bitcoin to be inflationary). Some people have pretty nuanced views about bitcoin, and their views about what changes bitcoin at a fundamental level isn't shared with the vast majority of the bitcoin community. These are the guys who will "hold out" on a hard fork. They would rather see the bitcoin they know and love die than see it turn into whatever fear they have about the change in question.

Depends on fees. Let's assume you get 5% cash back, and you can buy/sell bitcoin at a fee of 3.5%. 
So you buy $100 worth of bitcoin for $103.5. You get 5% cash back, so that's ~$5.18. Now you sell the $100 worth of bitcoin back, and are charged an additional $3.5 fee.
Total fees: $3.5 + $3.5 = $7
Total cash back: ~$5.18
Now let's assume that your fee for trading is 1% - in that case you could make a profit _if you could sell the bitcoin for the same price that you bought at_. Which isn't likely, so you'll have to take the exchange spread into account as well.

They may also be doomed just by the nature of riding on top of bitcoin. There's no guarantee that future bitcoin changes won't break XCP, Omni etc.
Something that I haven't seen people mention before is that if canonical transaction ordering (as described in [Gavin's IBLT gist]( is ever implemented, it will allow people to game the distributed exchanges with trivial effort by allowing people to "choose" generally where (roughly in the order) their transaction will appear in a block.

That's not true. The Omni protocol is designed such that address reuse is required even for the simplest of functions. The reason for goes back to addresses having a "balance" of e.g. TetherUSD, instead of TetherUSD UTXOs. 
So, for example, I buy 100 TetherUSD. If I want to spend 50 TetherUSD. I sign and broadcast the transaction. The transaction is confirmed, and the recipient has 50 TetherUSD and I still have 50 TetherUSD. But where is my $50? It's in the same address - because Omni protocol doesn't use the concept of change. The implication of this is that I must sign multiple transactions with that private key.
So, no, Omni on-chain tokens do not have all the properties of bitcoins in terms of privacy. Omni on-chain tokens REQIRE address reuse, which is very damaging to privacy.
EDIT: I'm also going to point out that Omni transactions can only use 1 address as the input of the transaction. i.e. while a bitcoin transaction can spend x number of UTXOs in a transaction, an omni transaction can only spend the tokens from 1 address. This further encourages address reuse by making it cheaper (in terms of transaction fees) to have your entire Omni token balance in a single address.
Omni does not have the same privacy as bitcoin, and actively encourages poor practices.

Seveneves takes place in two pretty distinct settings. The first is closer to Cryptonomicon/Reamde, while the other takes on a more sci-fi-y setting (closer to Anathem, though very distinct).
In terms of density/difficulty to read it's on par with Reamde. Easier and more compelling than Cryptomomicon or Anathem.
It's pretty different from his other work in the same way that Snow Crash is very different from Reamde.

Nice false dichotomy bro.
The face of the matter is that there are people who can or will not learn the technical details. Even among those who do, there will be some who ignore the shortcomings of BU and rally behind it anyway, because muh coffee, it's not fair, etc. I'm sure you're a bright guy, and you're able to understand the technical details.
But not everybody is like you. Not everybody is smart. Not everybody cares.
The war between BU and Core is not technical in nature. It's political. Both sides have their propaganda. Propaganda serves a purpose. It's effective. It helps rally support from those who can't or won't understand the technical details.
The world isn't some perfect place, where if we _just make the right argument_ the other side will be persuaded. It's about winning or moving on.

@_date: 2013-05-18 00:15:38
Valid and interesting questions.
To answer the latter, absolutely. That scenario is one in which Bitcoin is not adopted.
To answer the former you have to consider the potential of the currency. A Satoshi, the smallest fractional unit of a Bitcoin, represents a value magnitudes smaller than the current value of 0.01 USD. Considering the finite quantity of Bitcoin (21,000,000) and the potential number of people using Bitcoin, 1.0 Bitcoin represents a relatively large share of the currency. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that one day a Satoshi represents the rough equivalent of 0.01 USD in 2013, 1.0 Bitcoin would represent 1,000,000 USD.
Of course, that's making rather large assumptions of adoption - however the argument still stands even on smaller scales.

Within the next week it'll pop up to ~$140, and gradually rise over the next few months. 
Everybody on the market wants to see Bitcoin go for what they think it's worth. I don't know if anybody actually knows that that number is, but it's definitely not ~$110.
Breaking the $119 and $120 walls is what people needed to start putting volume into the market. I don't expect to see much stability, but I should hope that a 2-4000 BTC buy or sell won't shake the market for a few hours.

It's like a PO box.
All of the mail received is addressed to the PO box number. All of the mail you send has the PO box as the return address.
You own the only key to the PO box. You can make a copy of the key, but that means that if you lose it someone can come steal all the mail from your PO box.
Of course, the PO box number is the public address, and the key to the PO box is the private key.
Since it's the year 2013 and that's practically the future you have the ability to just speak a special string of characters to the PO box and it'll open it for you. Every once in a while when you're at the post office you'll see somebody having a mental breakdown.

Yes, but what does useful mean? Even at 30 seconds, and depending on the size of the purchase, crypto currencies aren't feasible at a coffee shop or the grocery store. You're going to have a line of people to check out, and a line of people waiting for confirmations - or breaking out their laptops cause the cell lost signal.
It'd absolutely be convenient if confirmations are faster - but I don't think the current model of crypto currencies is feasible for typical over the counter transactions. 
[See Open Transactions]( Or maybe we'd send "day use" money to a hosted wallet, and then we'd be able to use NFC to perform debit transactions. Really - nobody knows.
But assuming Bitcoin continues to gain ground, somebody's going to pour enough capital into it to develop a reasonable solution.

A messaging service. Each character sent to an address costs 1 coin (or some fraction), and similar transaction fees as Bitcoin.
All of the coins used to compose the messages that are sent to me are added to my wallet, which I can later use (after confirmations) to return messages.
The only person who can read the message is the one who owns the private key for the address to which the message was sent. Add a reasonable character cap, and you have a zero trust, encrypted, peer to peer messaging system.

I don't care to speculate on whether Satoshi expected to see the items you mention, "pooled mining, and GPU/ASIC arms race," however the system has scaled beautifully up to this point. It's incredible that he mined the first block with his CPU, and now the network has ["Bitcoin Network Speed 8 Times Faster than Top 500 Supercomputers Combined."](
But I also don't think this is a political issue - and I don't think it's a question of how Satoshi designed Bitcoin. It's an open source project. It has to change, morph, and grow. If a person doesn't like it, they have the power to do something about it.
What it comes down to is that there's no reason for me to download the blockchain to my cell phone.

The words you chose make me think that the value you see is only monetary - albeit as a consequence of being a superior currency.
I don't think Bitcoin needs to see other currencies fail in order to demonstrate superiority. In fact, I'd rather not see a currency fail even if it does mean more money in my pocket.
I also don't think we've begun to explore the possibilities of Bitcoin, other crypto currencies, and similar structures to distribute non-monetary data (digital rights, secure email, etc).
So yes, I expect and look forward to the day (cross my fingers) that the coin I have has a higher value. But the impact of Bitcoin on me as an individual is going to pale in comparison to the impact on individuals in the rest of the world.

This may give great insight into Paypal's Bitcoin integration strategy, if there is in fact one. ebaydeals sells hot items, at a "steep" discount, with a quick turnover, without bidding, and every single seller accepts Paypal.

The soundness of an investment in ASIC mining hardware should not be gauged on the future BTC exchange rate.
Scenario 1: You buy a 100 BTC ASIC. If the hardware produces above 100 BTC, great. Perfect. ROI.
Scenario 2: You buy a 100 BTC ASIC. The hardware returns 90 BTC, however the BTC exchange rate has doubled. You may have "come out on top," however it would have been a better investment to just hold the coin instead.
The BTC exchange rate does not play a role in the ROI of ASIC mining hardware.

Look, nobody is glad that bitcoin is difficult to scale. Many small blockers used to be big blockers... until they realized that unrestrained, or even relatively modest blocksize increases could cause irreparable damage to bitcoin.
Nobody likes high fees, nobody likes the strife. Small blockers came to the _difficult position._ The ugly truth is that it's difficult to scale bitcoin, so let's not destroy it in the process.

Two things:
1. use a new address with which to receive Bitcoin for every customer.
2. Though it's not often used (in my experience), you can sign and verify a message. If you want to test it out to get a feel for how it works, input the following to the "Verify Message" tab at brainwallet.org:
Message (without quotes): "blah blah blah"
 Signature:     HDDxN4YF2Dq6zKNWW8hM8/iW0QiVoW14ah52aW2ETwHr9dZrRGJfeD0xqWnMa+a6boL/27m2CtksKDoyvNxZmrU=
By doing the above, you will receive the address form which the message and signature was generated, if valid.
Though the best method may be to use a service such as Coinbase.

The transaction is instant, but it's set in stone after ~10 minutes.
Under most circumstances it's only important to verify that the transaction was broadcast to the network and that it has a transaction fee.

There's a pretty large list that I put together down below. What I came to realize while typing it out is that the Bitcoin that you have access to is your responsibility. You can do whatever you want with it - nobody can say otherwise. That's huge, considering I can't even check my account balance online at times because Chase is always "down for maintenance."
* The largest (security) risk in using Bitcoin is not inherent to the currency, but rather the user.
* Fees can be verified as having been delivered to a miner. That is, we know where our fees are going, and the we know they are being exchanged for a necessary service.
* Transactions are (if not instant) near instant
* No counterfeiting
* Defined rate at which Bitcoin is minted
* Can be sent to anyone without concern for any boundary
* Escrow
* Time released transactions
* No authority to rely on
* 0% risk of hyperinflation
* No merchants on your bank statement
* Tip anyone (bitcointip)
* Purchasing something is never an inherent security risk (private key is never exposed)
* No chargebacks
* Transactions not necessarily associated with real life identity
* All transactions are timestamped
* Sub-cent transactions
* Bitcoin protol will develop and improve over time
* Nearly negligible (if not negligible) fees
* Potentially a great store of value for those living in countries with a failing currency
* Never having to drive to the bank for deposits/withdraws
* We have yet to fully investigate the new technology on which Bitcoin is built
* A Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible (requires protocol modifications)

When you make an instant purchase you receive the Bitcoin instantly, and Coinbase makes a withdraw from your account. But it takes the bank a few days to process things - so there's a period of time that you have your USD and the Bitcoin.
Same thing happens when you cash out. The bank just takes forever.

This is actually an idea I've explored a fair amount.
I think they key is in two different items:
* QR codes are generated in such a manner that each table has a unique set of QR codes, and thus by submitting payment the waitstaff also knows where to bring the food.
* Each "set" of QR codes is only used once. This keeps the restaurants finances under wraps and minimizes the amount of information scraping available to the public. There may be some interesting tablet vs paper menu optimization with regard to overall expense for the restaurant, however I'd only foresee that being a problem with the cheap cheap restaurants and the higher end (for which this probably isn't an option anyway).

You're on the right track with the idea of colored coins, but there's an important distinction to make. What you need is the ability to verify that an address is owned by you, rather than a specific Bitcoin. The "color" of a coin follows that coin wherever it goes. So to say that a Bitcoin is owned by you can't be true once you send it to an address to which you don't have the private key.
However, colored coin can be used to accomplish this.
1.) Generate a key pair (A)
2.) Generate another key pair (B)
3.) Write down the message that you want associated the coin colored with. In this case, I'd say something like, 




4.) Sign the above text via PGP.
5.) Sign the text and signature of the PGP message with address (A).
6.) Generate a brainwallet from the signature of step 5 (and some salt if you feel so inclined), address (C)
7.) Broadcast a transaction from address (A), with outputs to addresses (B) and (C). Any quantity of Bitcoin will accomplish the task, however I'd suggest the smallest quantity that's considered a standard transaction.
**Great, so what have we done?**
* Wrote a message that explains the intent of the transaction.
* Associated the message with date and time by putting it in the text of the message.
* Associated the message with the date and time by signing it with PGP.
* Associated the message with an identity by signing it with PGP.
* Associated the message with a Bitcoin address by signing it with the private key.
* Associated the message with date and time by broadcasting a transaction to an address generated with the message signature.
**From here you have two options.**
1. Do nothing until the day that you need to prove that address (B) belongs to you. When the time comes, pull out the message and hand it over to the party to which you are proving your ownership of this address. Then generate the private key for address (C). By "redeeming" the token sent to address (C), you can reasonably claim that you are the entity that owns the Bitcoin in address (B). This method is handy it you want to maintain plausible deniability, or if you want to associate an address with some identity that is other than your real life identity (for example, proof of Bitcoin ownership without revealing any personal information). Note that this method shouldn't require the PGP signature, because the token in address (C) represents ownership of address (B).
2. Publicly post the message, signature, and salt. This allows anybody to verify that the message is associated with a transaction by being able to generate the private key for address (B). It's crucial to include something in the message that "proves" that you were the one who wrote it. This method allows the coin to be publicly verified, however lacks plausible deniability. Keep in mind that this method allows anybody access to the funds in address C.
Considering if this would hold up in any context except that of an internet forum, I highly doubt it.

That's an excellent question. Current market price is ~$125.
Every entity that is currently accepting Bitcoin is banking not on that figure but on potential.
The amount of revenue generated just by BFL I'm sure is astounding. 
5 million to Coinbase, 2 million to Bitpay. EFF. Gyft. That Russian PayPal-like service. Reddit. Pirate Bay. OK Cupid.
People underestimate the investment already poured into Bitcoin. We're on the precipice.
So to answer your question - the price of one bitcoin is ~$125. But nobody knows the value of one bitcoin, and I'm not exactly sure we'll know anytime soon.
Also consider the value of having decentralized currency, the value of freedom to exchange funds with anybody, the value of carrying cash instead of debt.
I probably didn't answer your question - but that's what the value of Bitcoin is.

No, they're splitting up the hash from the original document, and each one of those is converted to an address. Interestingly enough though, any coin that's sent those addresses will very likely never be accessed again.
It's easy to find an address, near impossible to find the associated private key.

1. Verify the above message with the signature. Note that it verifies to [this address.]( You'll have to add the line breaks manually if you copy paste.
2. Generate a brainwallet, using the signature as the passphrase. Note that the [address generated]( received a transaction from the above address.
3. Consider that by doing the above two steps, one can verify the following: 
a.) An address broadcast a transaction, 
b.) That address signed a timestamped message, 
c.) The message outlined a sequence of events, 
d.) The transaction occurred as described, 
e.) The first confirmation of the transaction was within a reasonable timeframe of the message signing.

But why should we push businesses to accept Bitcoin for goods if we're not willing to accept it for our hard work? 
Of course it'd be foolish to receive the whole paycheck in Bitcoin, but I'd be thrilled to receive something like 5-20% in BTC.
It's risky no matter who you are. But the ones who are accepting it for goods or services are the ones who are going to benefit most when/if bitcoin increases in value.
