I wonder if it's tricky because of extra rules around fiat, and the fact that they have a weird setup where BTC customers are not KYC/AML'ed. So if they gave BTC customers access to fiat, those customers maybe couldn't even withdraw it

Nothing really works. If you look closely enough at anything, you'll see it's all held together with baling wire and duct tape. The world and people are super complex, all we as naked apes can do is try to shape things as best we can. That's why you get something like the Challenger disaster, like Fukushima, like the Hindenburg. These things don't mean that space travel isn't within our grasp, that we can't harness the power of the atom, that we can't master flight, it just means those things are hard. We choose to Bitcoin not because it is easy, but because it is hard, because it is a challenge we intend to win.

Your math is wrong regarding the fees: try totaling the fees if you can't see why your numbers are wrong, but even if it were right you are answering your own question. People can see the general settlement costs ahead of time and can adjust accordingly. You can think of it right now: it doesn't make sense to send $0.02 on the network right now so a channel for that amount does not make sense either, even though LN can send sub Satoshi amounts 
@_date: 2016-08-13 09:58:03

@_date: 2016-08-08 11:13:45
I don't really understand what you're trying to say, but yes smart contracts can have time limits and you can pre-sign transactions which basically is like limiting sends to the signed destinations
However I think that would be complicated and when you get complicated sometimes you get more failures
The simple thing for them to have done would have been to still use cold storage, because that is simple
Another thing I think could be interesting would be to give users a signing key, that the exchange never holds. The users themselves would then have to participate in their own hot wallet withdrawals 
@_date: 2016-08-29 02:13:20
Generally fees are cheap, like ten cents, but it depends on the transaction. If you get a good wallet it will figure it out for you

Pruned HD wallets generate new keys, so there is no need to look backwards for information about the keys produced. 
It might get tricky though if you generate thousands of keys with a pruned HD wallet and then don't use them, and your wallet has to be restored, Bitcoin Core with HD support won't literally be watching every possible key. It will watch hundreds of keys and then expand its search if there are hits, but it can't watch for all possible keys from the HD seed.

Just because the way of deploying it is well known: we've done it with P2SH, CSV, CLTV, and that way is minimally disruptive when compared with alternatives. For some things, a hard fork might be appropriate, it's just about the right tool for the right job.


Ideally the influence of Core is minimized. The goal of the network is to make something very distributed and decentralized, so I don't like the idea of encouraging any set of developers as "blessing" changes, since that harms the value proposition of Bitcoin as something that is a broad standard shared by many individuals.
People should make up their own minds and Core should ideally be careful to strike a balance in helping to encourage that.

You've literally been lying about Core in this thread, stating that they won't accept code from "outside" developers. Not letting lies and attacks stand is not aggressive, I'm just correcting your incorrect statements about other people. Your only response seems to be more personal attacks, but that is very consistent with your posting history.
@_date: 2016-08-11 11:27:15
Right, make sure to write down the seed
@_date: 2016-08-02 07:08:24
I've seen a 51% attack proposed as a response to a minority chain fork and I am not a fan of this idea at all.
The only situation I've seen where it might be acceptable would be one where the 51% percent attack was worked into the hard fork itself, so that the minority chain would really have zero chance of surviving if the miners went with the fork: I think some people have called this an evil soft fork
In that specific case the justification for a 51% attack would be that it would actually be a defense against other attacks, like people taking advantage of out of date nodes to steal from them
Even in that case I'd suggest not assuming you can be a jerk just because you're on the Internet and everyone is an asshole on the Internet whatevs. I'd give people plenty of time and heads up to switch their PoW and continue separately, amicably
@_date: 2016-08-14 00:37:08
I want a full node because I want low trust, real bitcoins when I receive bitcoin. Because I want the network to be a peer to peer system that is difficult to shut down. Because I want the privacy of not revealing my transaction information to others. 
I do use an SPV wallet as well, but I also appreciate my full node
A network made up of only high end servers is not what I want to see Bitcoin become. And low end servers should eventually match high end servers, so it's just a matter of being patient
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:47:46
You didn't mention any cap increase or block size increase, you're adding that now, and it still doesn't make sense
There's no reason to assume that since all the evidence points the other way and you have no evidence for your assertion.
I'm not defending anything but people's ability to discuss facts instead of made up stories about Core not accepting blocksize increases because they are "foreign", which is just an absurd lie
@_date: 2016-08-02 01:33:44

The current proof is a tweet.
It's not hard to do better than that, cryptographically speaking. This month NASA's Kepler Space Telescope Twitter account tweeted out [a risqué photo of a woman's butt (not safe for coinbase bank partners)]( To no one's surprise, it was not taken as scientific proof of a new heavenly body.
A great starting method for proving reserves is to use a single proof for each depositor that their specific funds are present, using a Blockchain verifiable signature on their specific chunk of funds. The exchange then adds that signature to a merkle tree, and publishes a merkle root to let users see that their chunk is part of a larger set of signatures. Next, users can compare notes with each other, to spot check the internal consistency of the tree and ensure that it is not a forgery and that the movement of funds is consistent against the total merkle root.

Your math is wrong, and your logic is wrong. Just do the multiplication of fees by your targets, it doesn't add up. And remember that the settlement type tx must be the lowest range fees since they can take days to settle without issue so you can't compare them to next block fees. For example currently low range fees are two cents now and high range fees are ten cents. Your logic doesn't make sense, it's like saying that if we make electric cars high priced, how will the world be able to afford to drive them? Things have physics driven cost, work needs to be done to reduce costs
@_date: 2016-08-11 15:44:29
You did not include a fee on your transaction, it may never confirm

1. Mining the Blockchain is basically global time-stamping system. Miners can't change the rules of the system, their job is not to verify or act as a server, the role of miners is just to keep a single global ordering between many possible versions and to distribute the currency over time.
2. Although mining is hard, theoretically anyone anywhere can participate, and anyone anywhere can be a member of the network, without the need to depend on any central server: miners aren't central servers.
3. The Blockchain serves as an open settlement system. People do a lot of trading on separate systems like Bitcoin exchanges which are not the Blockchain, but then they can move between those systems or back to themselves through the Blockchain.
4. Although most funding for mining comes in from the block subsidy and only a small percentage from transaction usage fees, for the first four years of Bitcoin the subsidy value was less than the value than the value of just the miner fees today
5. Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin and was the first miner, but he was only around for the first two years, without a lot of activity. In the first year, there was so little activity that mining difficulty didn't change from the original difficulty for an entire year. The Bitcoin we have today has become a large community with many industrialized and specialized companies and people.
6. The purpose of mining is not to solve computer problems or verify transactions, it is to provably expend energy, at the lowest possible energy cost, so the most efficient energy and the most efficient computers are used for the job of proving energy was used.

Lady Gaga refers to a theoretically far fetched example for which the Blockchain might theoretically be used. It's a reference to a Satoshi Nakamoto thread where he also used it to discuss a similar topic.

The market would also not wait if the system became centralized to go for a decentralized alternative. That's why it's a balance


That's kind of thinking at the extremes, there is plenty of space in the middle where people use the Blockchain and it's still not the cheapest way to make a payment.


SPV doesn't break the P2P system if you are simply sending money, but it does break things when you receive money, because instead of the entire network validating rules, you just have a small percentage validating rules. I don't receive money with SPV, I only send.


I'd put the target cost at something where I could easily say to someone that they could run the full node for their own business and avoid dealing with a middle-man. So by comparison: MySQL/Apache/nginx, open source server software that can be run most anywhere.


Maybe at some point that would be reasonable, but requiring 100mb of bandwidth would a requirement I would be comfortable today to run a full node. Requiring 32gb of memory also sounds pretty high, I'd like to see the system requirement lower today. I run multiple full nodes for various purposes and what you are describing sounds expensive. Here's a quote for a cloud server with 32gb of memory and 100mbit:  it would cost $320/month. That seems excessive to me
Another thing to remember is that SPV clients still rely on full nodes, and generally on full nodes that are run on the kindness of strangers. If the full node count drops and the SPV count balloons, access to full nodes might just shift the cost to the SPV users anyway as they start having to compensate full nodes for using their resources

What do you think of that statement?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:54:32
Most importantly, you should do your own research. If people tell you that Bitcoin is something, don't just trust them, make sure you understand why it is, what it is for yourself.


You might have it returned. Or someone could file a false lien against you and your bank account could be frozen for no good reason. Really, in this case you trust the system. Sometimes the system works for people, sometimes it bites them. Bitcoin is about trusting yourself, you can store your own coins and own your own risk.


All currencies are volatile, but Bitcoin is indeed particularly volatile. The only consideration is that some currencies lose value to inflation endlessly, Bitcoin is designed with the intent of retaining value.

The market has to demand this with a clear voice, otherwise exchanges will not see a business case for supporting proof of reserves.

As far as funds go, it's fairly pointless to do that: if you're storing the large password offline, why not just store your funds in the large password itself?

Blocks are often full
In the last 10 blocks, acceptable fees have ranged from $0.04 - $0.15
One thing that does appear to be happening more and more recently is private transaction space bidding, where the blocks are filled with zero fee transactions that were probably purchased out of band
I've visualized the fees here: 
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:44:16

Storing coins on Coinbase or BitFinex is a worse idea than storing them on Blockchain.info
However, Blockchain.info could be hacked in some similar ways. A hacker could potentially hack their Javascript and listen in on unencrypted private keys. Or they could snag the private keys database, credit-card hack style and run brute force decryption on it.
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:28:49
It sounds like they are switching their App to be just a mobile packaged web app, like CoPay or GreenAddress

There's no logical reason to not attach RBF to super low fee transactions. There's already a good chance they won't complete, so they are already not safe to accept

There's actually only 1 alert key. It's just that multiple individuals know what the key is. There's definitely no way to know how many people have it. 
The power of the alert key is simply to broadcast a message across the p2p network. It has no power and implies no specific authority.


I do agree that Gavin was one of the people who knew the alert key. (This is not a source code key as stated in the op, and there isn't even such a thing as a source code key)

With a 95% threshold, you could rent a bit over 5% of hashpower and veto a change. That's good.
Protecting the rights of the minority is a good thing, not a bad thing.

Heaping unwarranted abuse on others and cheerleading those who take it far further is an abuse of these forums and a disgrace in any public setting, it's unacceptable: maybe understandable from a teenager in his parent's basement, but from someone of your years with a daughter and a Princeton education?

It depends on various factors, like the age of your backup file, etc - they have changed their backup format and unpublished their decryption utility unfortunately, which makes things harder. If your backup file is still encrypted, you will need to crack it, which is probably possible unless you used a super hard password, there are some services to help you crack it.

OK so you started working for them in August of 2014, and if you worked for them for two years, you must have very recently left the company.
Since that time, you've recommended Coinbase many times, but failed to disclose your personal financial interest.
Would have been interesting to know that when you told me the Core devs are deliberately turning Bitcoin into a [system made for LN and sidechains]( that I was in fact talking to a member of the Brian Armstrong astroturf squad and not a normal human.

I take it you don't want to store lady Gaga videos on the Blockchain then
My point is not against payment channels or people using the Blockchain (for currency purposes not lady Gaga), but that people expect devs to work without any support on stuff harder than they are already working, which is full time. People want improvement but when asked, "well can you help?" They turn away and say, "oh no time, can't do it, sorry."
@_date: 2016-04-29 17:17:15
Yeah it's just luck, and the targeting is not exact: it can be longer or shorter for a while
Giving it a wide variance helps the network by reducing the chance of splitting into two chains that have to be reorganized into one: like what happens when two miners find a block at the same exact time and one block has to be thrown out

They prey on weakness. For example was spinning up fictitious spreadsheets to spread to the press to show how Bitcoin was failing and calling the Core devs autistic weirdos who didn't understand basic economics - precisely timed to the spam attack. Afterwards? No need for spreadsheets to show that the network withstood a flooding attack as designed. It's harder to come up with convincing lies and smears when the network is working well, the price is going up, the Core devs are banging out awesome code, and major new players like Steam are entering. It's fear that feeds these kind of people and light and hope that drives them away. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 11:30:56
I don't mean to say that Trezor is a bad product, just that it needs improvement when compared with what's on the horizon with the near term competition.
I see the improvements I'm interested in happening in Ledger: new products, better screen and design, support for new Bitcoin tech. Trezor by comparison seems to be not keeping up, maybe that's just good marketing, but based on my personal experiences with my Trezor purchase, I can say that there is a lot left to improve.
I want something I can put in a person's hand and even if they have no knowledge of Bitcoin, I can trust that they will be able to keep and use their Bitcoins safely. That's probably a tough goal to reach, but I want something that gets as close to that as possible. While the Bitcoin-sphere has been distracted with fighting, the real problems of making a Bitcoin that mere mortals can use safely and easily has been here all along.

Well cryptographic hashing not encryption but yeah, the huge amount of computing power required even with a quantum computer to crack a spend within the RBF time window, it's something that we would easily see coming and could adjust to well ahead of time.

Authority in Bitcoin doesn't stem from node counts, it comes from hashpower proof.
I also think it's unlikely however long you ran your bot, that you would be able to simultaneously compromise 75% of the network nodes.

I'm not arguing, that's my point. I'm answering your direct question, directly. I have no argument to get across and I have no point I want to prove to you, other than to ask you to be upfront with people
I did explain the very simple facts of the difference between SPV and full validation. It's not rocket science, SPV doesn't check the contents of blocks and full validation checks everything it can. It's a very simple distinction. There is no argument, it doesn't matter what anyone's reputation is, that is just the facts.
People shouldn't wait for people with reputations to prompt them to do research, they should be personally responsible and do a little reading before they commit their finances to a crypto system. 
My question to you is why is your response to someone trying to prompt people to be careful about their security and ask people to be honest and up front, why is your response to personally attack them as paranoid and endlessly try to find a way to justify not being up front with people instead of simply agreeing that it's a good idea if people are informed?

You can join in and help out by assisting the project or related projects with testing and feedback

Oh even Gavin admitted that the doubters were right to question the risk-lessness that was promised because things went terribly wrong, and he made restitution to the people who lost money because of his mistakes. (Instead of using his own funds, he used funds earmarked for the promotion of Bitcoin though, which is pretty scummy to use to pay for his mistake)
Also let's not forget that if Luke-Jr had been run out of Bitcoin town as Gavin demanded, we might have had a disastrous fork due to Gavin's mismanagement of the project, (via accepting Mike Hearn's hard forking database change). Luke-Jr spotted the hard fork first and was the first to alert the miners to stop mining so that the hard fork could be resolved without too much loss. You can read what happened here:

@_date: 2016-04-23 15:31:48
I like this idea, except that miners can pay fees to themselves and there's no way to tell if they are doing it. That means the miners can cheat and manipulate the size to be bigger than necessary.
I think a solution to that problem would be that miners can choose to make a bigger block on a case by case basis, but only if they pay a penalty. So if they fake it, well at least they have to pay to fake it.
The penalty should be paid into the future block rewards of far future miners.

From a user is always right perspective yes. 
I tend to think of users who are cognizant of the block size issue as falling into two camps: 
1. Naive enough about the issue that they just blame every problem on a simple scapegoat
2. Cynical and evil enough that they take advantage of the naivety of others to promote the block size as a scapegoat. 
Of course I don't know which camp Roger Ver falls into, but I think for a very wide percentage of users who have been fed this scapegoat, they blame it for all ills and think the final solution is to eliminate it

The Lightning Network is a project to create a trading network for Bitcoin "I Owe You" tokens. These tokens will be redeemable on the Blockchain without any central party: the tokens are simply standard Bitcoin transactions.
While you are on the trading network, you can trade the tokens with others, and re-trade tokens that you get from others.
Token trading is how pretty much all money in the world works, even within Bitcoin. When you do a trade on a Bitcoin Exchange, you aren't adding a transaction to the Blockchain, you are adding a transaction to a private ledger run by a private company. This is how all the world's money already scales, so as a larger concept it is already proven to work "for good". Lightning is a trading token network that attempts to solve one of the main problems with existing trading token networks: that you have to trust them. 
1. **No Trust Needed**: Unlike a normal token trading system like Coinbase or Changetip, the trading network requires no trust in any other person or company.
2. **Instant Trading**: as soon as you transmit a token at Internet speed, the funds are sent. There is no need to wait potentially hours for a finalized version of a transaction, unlike the Blockchain.
3. **No minimum trades**: you can trade as small an amount as you would like, unlike the Blockchain, which has minimum limits.
4. **Improved privacy**: The network doesn't broadcast your transaction to the world or store it forever, it just sends it to one person. 
5. **Rewards nodes**: The network requires relaying nodes to operate, and in return users will pay fees for these relays.
The network won't "fix scalability for good". However scalability is already fixed for good, if you consider that in the worst case scenario we can do as good a job as the existing fiat systems - or better if you consider that Bitcoin has features that reduce risk even for a central service - for example: transparent accounting or multiple signature holdings.
Lightning's goal is to improve "trustless" scalability, which is what a lot of people want because that is the most similar to the existing Blockchain experience. If successful, Lightning will be a huge optimization, more than 10 times better, probably something like 100 or 1000 times better over the next five to ten years. That leaves room for an estimated 1 billion daily active users of trustless transactions.

This could be a problem for later half points, but in this current market the miners already have too much sunk cost in their equipment to turn anything off. The best estimates I've seen show that electricity cost is only a minority factor in the profit of the vast majority of miners.
The bigger miners already have something close to a monopolization (although they are trying to hide it), it might get a bit worse but we have that problem already. The only solution that I've seen is to wait it out until the market commoditizes the hardware which then moves around to settle in the cheapest electricity spots, but we are still far from that point. It's like waiting for the new iPhone features to appear in cheap cell phones, it will probably happen but it will take time.

Light vs heavy has pros and cons
One major negative of light wallets is that to get the information about your balances, they tend to ask random third parties to get this information. Pretty much 100% of them do this
If you care about securing your coins, one major step to take is to hide the fact that you have them. Asking a bunch of random third parties about specific balances can actually reveal that you have a lot of money, which could theoretically attract the attention of an attacker
If you use Core with Tor: it will hide how much you have and who you are

@_date: 2016-04-07 04:35:18
But they are increasing the capacity and thus the supply of transactions, which should lower the fees. So which do they want?
What you are mentioning as "in their own words" is the words of a few Core contributors that just describe as a hypothetical what would be the consequences of running into the block limit: the fees would increase. That's not a very controversial opinion, it almost certainly would happen. Or that the network will eventually be secured by fees, that plan was outlined by Satoshi
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:47:30
Yeah it's confusing, I find it confusing how to talk about it and I've lost track of the resource that explains all of the transaction types. Let me start over:
Think about when multisig was first rolled out. The old wallets didn't know about multisig, so they weren't compatible. Of course, they could receive funds from multisig sources, even though they didn't know what multisig meant. To this day, some people think of multisig (p2sh) as being not really part of Bitcoin and they don't want to use it. They don't recognize the 3xx addresses or support the idea of p2sh, but they can still use Bitcoin, the upgrade is not mandatory
So the same thing will happen with SegWit, in different forms and phases. Segwit will also probably get its own address type, although not in the first release. In the interim it will get a release in which it uses p2sh addresses, like multisig. With those addresses, it doesn't matter to the person sending to you what you are doing, whether it's multisig 2 of 3 or Segwit, or some other script. So if your client is cool with people using multisig, it is also cool with people using SegWit
Not sure if that is more clear
@_date: 2016-04-14 09:49:59
To help mitigate this problem, when you send ID information, add a huge watermark on top of it to say, "this is for XYZ site".
Of course you will still potentially leak your ID numbers etc, but it's a screwed up system and there's no good solution

Only if you consider electricity cost. The other costs: R&amp;D, operations, accounting, security, taxes, etc: my guess is that they are quite significant. 
I'm also privy to some private information that I can't reveal that informs my guess, but yes it is a guess


I'd say that being more profitable makes it more centralized: the winners of the mining game are those with access to the capital and chip fabs that are necessary to dominate. Profitability informs how easy that access is: average Joe has zero chance. 
If the chips weren't profitable, I think the manufacturers would be falling all over themselves to try and unload them, whereas now it seems like they don't want to sell their best stuff at all.

I didn't say that...
My point is that there is an organized group of people, who are very strenuously fighting to only scale on the Blockchain and resist any and all other proposals, including LN and SegWit. This exists, and Coinbase is part of it. 


I don't know this. Coinbase's CEO has called the Core Devs a "threat to Bitcoin". There's been quote after quote about "firing the devs", "we need a new team", "this is an election". Coinbase and Gavin have been promoting a subreddit that has a new hit piece on a Core dev every week. 
Gavin's portrayed Lightning as [centralizing]( 
Another quote directly from Classic founder:

If it is not sending, that could be an issue with the fee. Multibit is not an actively maintained wallet and it has fee issues, you should switch to another wallet, like Electrum. Do you have a txid you can share?
The secondary address is probably just change for your transaction, when you send funds if the amounts don't match up perfectly to what you received before you have to send some to the destination and some back to yourself. You can read more here 
@_date: 2016-04-21 05:53:45


I recommend you read the reference here:  which goes into detail on all the benefits
- Transaction malleability fixes benefit everyone from developers who have to code guards for it, to users who get confused by malleability spam, to full nodes that have to waste time syncing malleability spam attacks
- Sighash linear scaling benefits every full node by making it dramatically more efficient to validate transactions
- Improvements to multisig security prevents a situation where one of the parties in the multisig is able to brute force the signature and steal funds. This benefits anyone who has funds secured by multisig
The main benefit though as far as the discount is concerned is the cost of keeping the UTXO set in memory. Although the data still is synced as you say, there is a lower memory requirement with SegWit transactions. 


With SegWit, new non-validating modes may be possible where this is a relevant savings. For example: in the future a user may choose not to bother to validate transaction signatures that are more than 5 years old. SegWit gives the option for those signatures to not even be synced.

OpenBazaar is maybe good, but incredibly overhyped. Go shopping:  - does this look like something that is going to move the needle? 
My private theory is that actually government is putting pressure on guys who have a lot of Bitcoin and there is some increased supply pressure as they are forced to sit on their coins.
There are some bad actors, involved in various illegal or borderline illegal activities, who have been mucking up the works of Bitcoin at a high level, like the Cryptsy guys, and probably the Chinese miners are playing games with laws and or the truth. For example, they may be abusing government tech development subsidies, they may be hiding their true hashing power in other pools, not following investment regulations, I think it's a good bet that they aren't following all the regulations in China because very few companies over there do. I think that this is a game that works for a while but eventually the truth comes out or the government's Eye of Sauron glances your way and it's game over.
When these guys go on the run, they stop selling at exchanges, they start looking for cover. And if demand stays steady, the price goes up. Just my personal theory though, the price is very unpredictable and no one wants to reveal their cards. Even though I think it's insanely unlikely, it could even be because of open bazaar.

Economic Darwinism is not a game I care to play. Bitcoin is about volunteerism and cooperation: it's about Liberty.   That's what it's been from the start and it's the only vision that makes sense, because that's the fundamental system design.
Let's say I want to voice an unpopular viewpoint. But no one cares to listen. Is my Liberty infringed? What if other people say they won't like me if I say bad things? Is my Liberty gone then? No. 
Except maybe I choose myself to silence my thoughts because they are unpopular, because of the others, and then I may complain that I can't say what I like. But really, I can, it's just I can't live with the consequence of lack of cooperation. People who don't get that are slaves of their own choice.
The best course of action for me if I want to maintain my right to speak my mind is just to ignore the consequences of others and say what I think. Same goes for Bitcoin, miners, merchants, exchanges can do what they want, it might have some impact on me but it doesn't control me unless I allow it to, and I choose not to allow it to. I maintain the right to my currency and anyone else brave enough to reject coercive attackers can continue using the currency right along with me.

No one really has a definitive list of all the transactions on the network. There's no authority, just transactions people have seen go by. So you could easily miss one and get no warning. Even without a "51%" attack, a miner could easily just slip a transaction into a block.

People definitely disagree on how much decentralization should be sacrificed. It's difficult to find the consensus point where generally everyone agrees that the sacrifice is not too great.
At the extreme, the exponential curve of scaling cost means that you quickly hit a point where there is absolutely no decentralization - leaving the system extremely vulnerable and giving no one the freedom to run their own node and be their own bank.

If the economic majority truly wanted to change the block size, and only change the block size, well then nothing could stop them.
The trouble comes when you start thinking about the tradeoffs, oh well you break all the clients and you lose ASIC advances and you lose the developers and you split the community, etc. Suddenly the economic majority has second thoughts: well in actuality they don't really want to change the block size after all.
Gavin and Jeff have been saying that if people don't listen to them, Bitcoin will fail. Jeff recently said that Bitcoin would become no better than TOR if we don't allow it to expand to "mainstream" use cases like to assist Fidelity bank. 
Well for me, TOR is a role-model for Bitcoin. It's not a flashy startup, it doesn't have a million users or make a bunch of money for the developers of it, but it does one thing and it does it well, it's a principled project and I hope that TOR doesn't sacrifice its essential properties to get some more "mainstream" users.
Gavin has a definition of Bitcoin's mining majority that is out of line with Satoshi's concept.
Here is [Gavin on the subject of a 51% threat](


Here is [Satoshi on the subject of a 51% threat](
consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.
We have two separate and irreconcilable visions. The idea of the "mainstream" Bitcoin that sacrifices its property of trustlessness and decentralization to grow and grow at any cost. And the idea of the "free" Bitcoin that is relentless in its pursuit of a truly p2p currency with no middlemen.
Gavin has also never been polite where Peter Todd is concerned:












Basically, Gavin is fighting a war of words and manipulation, when others are trying to do science. I challenge to defend his illogical assertions that he blogs about, with more logic than "I chatted with some economist friends about it". Otherwise, all he is doing is repeating mantras like "The incentives are very strong" and promising to make Bitcoin great again, smearing his critics with ad-hominem attacks, and refusing to answer anyone in a fair and equal forum. He's refused to answer me many times, he's refused to participate in discussion on the dev mailing list, he refuses to talk to anyone unless they follow him. And that's a pattern of many years. And if you challenge him on it, his response is, "life is too short to argue". Well life is too short to pay attention to Gavin's cries for attention, in my opinion.

I was watching the entire time, the fastest possible fee never reached tens of cents, maybe some fee estimators were overly aggressive: but any more than about 10 cents never would have made a difference. Pretty much the highest was $0.07 or $0.08. For reference see  -  -  - to see what fees were required.


I looked at every one of these posts, none of them who paid more than a nickel for an average transaction did not get a confirmation in a timely manner. 100 of the problems happened when people paid near zero fees or re-spent unconfirmed transactions.


Personally, I don't treat the white-paper as gospel. I think affordable is a fine goal, but given a choice between affordable and decentralized, personally I will pick decentralized.


One interesting chart for you to look at:  - transactions dropped by over 50% in a single day. That's a bit out of the norm no? If you were watching  at the time, you would have seen huge spurts of transactions come across the wire, and then when the attack was over: nothing. The interesting thing about these transactions: all at the bottom of the fee range: because it was an attack.


In a couple months we'll likely see the rollout of SegWit starting which will double the addressable blocksize


Attacks cost money and they are not sustainable. It doesn't make a lot of sense to make decisions based on them, because it's a good bet they will go away if they don't accomplish anything for anyone.


The only vulnerability is in increasing the fees someone pays by a few pennies. It's not what I consider to be a large vulnerability.


If it's so logical, must be weird that 100% of active developers oppose a hard fork to make blocks bigger. These 50 devs, they all are not capable of reason? I don't see the logic of it either. 
Blocks being small protect from attacks by limiting the expenses of the full node operator. This protects the decentralization of the network, which is more important than a few pennies.


I'm not against a flexcap, however it should be approached safely and in a non-coercive way. People should opt-in to a change like this, because it is a fundamental change in Bitcoin.


Whatever it's called, I'm happy if it succeeds. It doesn't have to be called Bitcoin or use the same ledger: it just has to be p2p money. In my estimation, keeping Bitcoin decentralized is the best shot we have of Bitcoin succeeding in that long term scenario.


I disagree with this reading of history. I suffered no problems in the March usage increase, beyond increasing my fees be a few pennies. I saw no evidence that anyone who using Bitcoin following best practices saw any problems either. 
As far as Satoshi goes, I think he mentioned that the network couldn't support [any and all transactions at low cost](


And Satoshi mentioned that [remaining p2p was critical for Bitcoin](
Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own. 
And Satoshi mentioned that a [low bandwidth Blockchain]( would be helpful to resist attacks:


And Satoshi argued that possibly the [Blocksize could be constrained to control costs to the nodes](


Finally, Satoshi designed the very mechanism you are disparaging: [you can just pay a higher fee to get into a block](


As for fees?


 - fastest transaction, highest fee: $0.02 - that's data you can't deny.


Can't really parse this. You know that the argument is against changing things dramatically, not instigating a change right? Blocks have always been limited, Satoshi implemented the block limit at 1mb. The only way you can say, "we are changing things" is by making up a twisted logic that by not changing things we are changing things. Well that just erases the meaning of the word change.


In a theoretical free market, the miners should ultimately charge the lowest possible fee. If they have no significant marginal cost, that fee would be zero or very close to zero. 


Miners can do what they want. There's no central planning because anyone can run whatever rules they prefer. Central planning means that someone in a central position implements the rules. But that's not how Bitcoin works. Some decentralized developers come up with various rules and then decentralized network of nodes decides to implement or not implement these rules. No one has a magic key that decides these rules: the process of deciding them is decentralized.

I think they want to create a marketplace, but they are doing it in a stupid way for marketing reasons.
There are problems with setting up a website and selling: it's hard for people to discover you, to trust you, or for you to trust that the people who do help customers discover you and help customers trust you won't shut you out or start charging rent for that position. This is how Google, PayPal, VISA, etc make money: they are middlemen between stores and their customers and they charge rent for being in the middle.
So the pitch is that you can have OpenBazaar help your goods get discovered and they will try and do it in a way where they can't say no to you. And you can use Bitcoin and their moderators to establish customer trust, and that also can't have them say no to you. And because they can't say no, they can't charge rent.
The decentralization part is in their framework for setting up the marketplace and payment flow, it means they have a hands off attitude towards the stores.

Some clients do not recognize p2sh (multisig or other script) addresses as valid Bitcoin addresses. So you can't send from them to any 3xx address. 
At launch, SegWit will use a 3xx address for receiving. So those old clients, they can't send to a SegWit client if that client can't generate 1xx addresses as well. If it can, there is no problem but then there is no benefit of SegWit because it is not used. Luckily the vast majority of wallets have no issue with 3xx addresses because they were used for multisig, but there are some people who still argue that they are not valid and don't include support for them in their wallets. Receiving from those people is a problem if the SegWit client can't generate a 1xx address for them to send to.
Sending funds around will otherwise not be a problem even with old clients because the inputs and outputs still work the same, just the script that spends them is different. The scripts don't matter once the transaction is in the block chain: an old client that doesn't know about multisig doesn't care if the multisig transaction checked out because it doesn't even know what the address type means. It just knows that the transaction appears and doesn't break any of the rules it knows about, because rules that it enforces are less restrictive. Old clients will however not be able to understand the transactions at an unconfirmed stage: they will look non standard and it will ignore them, until they enter the Blockchain and then they will know that they have the funds.

The main problems with address reuse come from reusing it for multiple transactions. Since there is actually only one real blockchain transaction and the rest are obscured and exchanged privately out of the blockchain, that mitigates the problems of blockchain analysis. You can't analyze what you can't see. The security problem of address reuse is also mitigated because the address isn't really being reused as far as the Blockchain is concerned.
There remains an issue of private analysis, if you notice two sites have the same receiving address, well you can put it together that they are the same entity. You can make many channels to address that, but it would be limited by your capital since channels require capital. 
Possibly there could be a privacy improvement to use stealth addresses, but I'm not sure if that's feasible with the LN design

The desperation in the "anti Core" crowd is so palpable at this moment. Fastest possible fee: $0.03


You know someone has a weak point when they bring in the "think of the children" line. Fees will always be variable in Bitcoin and in LN too, that's just how they work.


So LN could be a fractional reserve banking because someone decided to make it into something it isn't? You could say the same thing about a sofa. What if Coinbase decided to take your sofa and then just added a little raspberry pi on there and then gave you fractional Bitcoin on there that you can trade with people on Coinbase's network? OMG alert the Bitcoin police, sofas lead to fractional reserve banking!


Undetectable? If you allow for fractional reserves, well you should just assume they are there. You can say the same thing about Coinbase right now: are you sure your deposit of Bitcoin that is there is really there?
Funny to use Coinbase as an example, because they are part of the cabal who are fighting LN tooth and nail. And the likely  reason they are fighting is because they know it will hurt their ability to do KYC AML and that Lightning will make things easier for people that will hurt their competitive advantage. 


Fees are $0.03. We'll soon have the capacity for a million+ every day. No one is ruling out further increasing that limit in the future. And as long as you use actual LN and not some other thing that is not LN, you are operating in a no-trust-needed environment.
Actually I like the idea of fractional reserve anyway. It's not a boogey man. It's just been abused recently by a system that is now so fundamentally based on fractional reserve, the ratio has lost all meaning: it should be called "no reserve". Leverage continues to go up and up, and in a crash we now have "too big too fail" banks that live on the largess of the public when their failures do happen. Fractional reserve didn't cause this, no reserve caused this.

Ln isn't ready yet 
To use it, you'll make a transaction like you do today- but instead of broadcasting to every peer on the Bitcoin network you will upload it only to select peers on the Lightning network. 
All of this will be hidden behind the implementation, so a normal user won't really see that the broadcast to everyone has become a upload to select nodes
That's for sending funds. Receiving funds is a bit trickier. You will still give out your address the same way, but there is a new component where if someone sends you a transaction, you are responsible for holding on to it: there is no shared Blockchain database to carry that duty.  I think it's possible someone will make a separate p2p or cloud database to provide that service, but that's just guessing. So you'll need to make sure you can store your wallet file safely

There are a couple of barriers to sidechains advancing:

2. The Blockchain needs an upgrade to allow for a decentralized 1:1 swap with a sidechain, providing for a value peg

100% of wallets require a "deposit" into them. A LN wallet is actually quite simply a 2:2 multisig wallet, and multisig wallets are already quite common. So potentially you would deposit all of your funds into it. 
I agree with you that this is a question that will be answered in the marketplace though: we'll see what solutions people prefer.


Again, the individual Lightning clients can make this determination, this is a decentralized process where anyone can use this protocol. So far I've heard suggested that nodes are selected using a semi-random heuristic, like the peer selection of a Bitcoin node or network SPV client.


I think this is TBD as far as the user experience, but possibly just one address that works in both situations. Or maybe we can come up with something better than addresses? They already have some big drawbacks

History does support my claims. Fees never rose above pennies, ever ever ever. The network suffered an attack, it was resisted. Eventually attackers should realize the fruitlessness of their efforts, and the people enabling them by spreading their message of fear will fade away, and that problem will resolve itself.
On the current course, given the existing data, we should see lower fees soon, not higher, that's just what the numbers show. While people like you preach fee doom, I continue to pay a few pennies for the fastest possible confirmation and see no data that this will change.
I support larger blocks, when done in a safe way that does not unduly jeopardize the network or people's ability to use Bitcoin. 
I support a network eventually secured by fees and not block subsidy. The only sustainable way people will pay anything meaningful for something, is if they can't get the same exact thing for free.

The larger picture is not classic, it's the alignment of anti core, of bigger blocks and status quo of the Bitcoin experience forever. Classic is just a manifestation of this alignment, Classic was formed the day after XT failed to activate, and the people involved are the same people who were involved in XT. 
I never said "all the 20-ish companies that support classic are fighting tooth and nail against LN" or that even that Coinbase is, singularly. I said its part of a group that is. And that's clear, from their words and from their actions. And it's clear that Coinbase is a part of this group, from admitted financial backing, to many blog posts, to top billing on their website, to calling the Core devs bringing these improvements "immature" and a "threat"
Where is Coinbase on supporting Segwit: nowhere. Why the attacks on new opcodes, suddenly when the opcode is for LN, when before there were no such attacks? Why the insistence on doing Segwit or other soft fork improvements as hard forks, when that's never been done before? The evidence points to what they are shouting themselves: block size must increase and that trumps everything.
I don't know if any evidence will convince you, you seem to have made up your mind, which is fine. If I told you apples fall when you drop them, you could say, "oh well how can you say that since you never dropped all the apples in the world". Well apples drop when you fall them, if you don't believe me, or the evidence, I can't do better than that.

No, you can use the entire network without trust, you don't need many channels. Lightning is designed for no trust all the way. Maybe you are thinking of normal payment channels? Lightning links these channels up together in a trustless way

The funds are stored with LocalBitcoins. To complete the trade, you tell LocalBitcoins to release the funds you deposited, which assigns those funds to the other person's account at LocalBitcoins.
Make sure to have plenty of time before the trade to deposit your coins, they require 3 confirmations

If the smart contract is a blockchain thing that the user sees, it would have to be done by the receiving wallet. Smart contracts are driven by the person who creates the receiving side, like if you send to someone, you can't send a "multisig" transaction to them if they don't give you a multisig address.
If there were a specialized exchange wallet though, I think what you are talking about could be possible

If you get one confirmation it's still not certain, but much more certain than 0. It's not recommended to only wait one confirmation because it's still quite uncertain.
But confirmations don't come every ten minutes, they come roughly every 0-120 minutes. Your customer could be waiting for hours even for one confirmation
The solution to your problem requires an off-chain answer. You ask for payment using some funds pre-locked with a multisig contract or using a payment channel or using a trusted third party network. 
For example when someone meets up to buy $5k in cash of Bitcoin via Localbitcoins, they are able to do it instantly because Localbitcoins holds the coins and does the confirms. The meet up just finalizes the deal

I've used it multiple times, it's not cryptographically safe or anything, it's a centralized trusted service, but the service itself is about as reputable as you can get. It's the people on the site you have to watch out for, think: "Craigslist", many good normal people, some bad.
As far as cash goes, if it's a meetup for cash, you find an advertisement from someone, you evaluate their reputation (you can always make a smaller trade first), you press "sell bitcoins" on their advertisement, you deposit the coins, go meet up with them, release the coins to them, get the cash, done. 
There are lots of other options to get fiat for Bitcoins, but a cash meetup or a Bitcoin ATM are probably the fastest ways if those options are available in your area

If the point of the network is to provide decentralization, the more nodes / the more people running them / the better

I don't really think of it as Democracy at all. There's no relationship between number of people and what happens for example. If you want to call it that, you can - I just don't feel like that term fits


Fewer full nodes staying online is certainly a symptom of a degradation in decentralization. The degradation would be: there would be a higher cost to use Bitcoin in a no-trust and privacy way.
There are other factors:
- Ease of using via Tor or poor connections (people behind firewalls or in a poor internet area)
- Mining centralization (faster bandwidth miners or validation skipping is rewarded)
Of course I said degrees, push a little on these factors and the degrees would be small, push hard on these factors, the degrees would be large.
@_date: 2016-04-11 08:23:01
Certainly possible, if you became big and successful and they noticed you. I'm using some private services already that do this kind of thing but with a bit of subtlety so the service can't really tell what's going on.
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:39:31
I think the best practice would be to keep many channels open, like 10 or so, and swap between them as much as possible. You could close them and open new ones as often as you feel your privacy requires.
This would match what is already considered good practice for "donation" addresses: change them up when someone sends some funds to them. 
And yes don't reuse addresses for multiple Blockchain transactions, including the LN wallet deposits

In my view of Bitcoin, everyone can use it how they please. I disagree with the view of Bitcoin where others ask people to leave or stop using it.


Well I can choose between mathematical certainty that it won't change or "likely to want", I would choose mathematical certainty. I don't think if all of the world used Bitcoin, they would necessarily share my values for the currency


Other people, even the vast majority are welcome to use a different brand of Bitcoin, I don't mind. For me, the essential property is that Bitcoin is a decentralized, no-trust currency. I don't want to have trusted middlemen, to have a trusted "majority". I want no-trust.
@_date: 2016-04-05 02:30:21
I think that a lot of the big bubble hype around Bitcoin was definitely misplaced, but you could say the same thing about any new technology as people figure out what it will be like.
1. Cashless society is probably going to be a net benefit for Bitcoin, as they crack down on cash and prepaid visas, what will be left for the people who can only use those things?
2. I think we've seen that governments are filled with corrupt people who want to hide their wealth. It could be that they never really close the Bitcoin loophole out of pure self-interest
3. Volatility will probably remain with Bitcoin for our lifetime. My hope here is that this will be more manageable if some governments start to promote capital investment via Bitcoin. You get the counterparty risk of the government and the capital market then, but it's a trade for the volatility risk of Bitcoin.

You should never use Blockchain-info wallet for any reason
Lookup the transaction id and see if other nodes still know about if
If they don't, sweep your private key from blockchain-info - you can use Electrum to do this. Generally nodes will forget about transactions after a couple of days, but a zero fee transaction might never have even been broadcast widely
This will restore your funds

BIP 0047 looks good and is active recently - I don't like BIP 0070: a lot of the privacy and centralization concerns that arose during its conceptualization were brushed off and it was kind of left half done.

I don't like the idea that Bitcoin is whatever some others want it to be, because that essentially makes the rules that protect Bitcoin's value meaningless in the long term.  For example I want a no middle man currency, so I buy Bitcoin today with the idea that Bitcoin will have no middleman later. If I believe that Bitcoin is whatever other people say it is, maybe other people will change their minds and say it's now got a middleman.
It's totally unpredictable what other people in the future will want out of Bitcoin
However if I stick to my definition of Bitcoin, that is predictable because I control the software that I run and I can just say I decide for myself what Bitcoin is, that is predictable since I control myself
Now certainly there could be a rebranding of Bitcoin by many others and the value in the future of my flavor of Bitcoin could reduce. But as long as there were still believers who felt the same way that I do, I could continue to use my brand of Bitcoin. Considering that I started buying Bitcoin at around $1, I've seen the value go super high and then crash many times. I'm prepared to deal with any valuation issues that may come if it means preserving the essential properties of Bitcoin

All transactions should include a fee
@_date: 2016-04-17 06:35:58
Miners have to pay for electricity so they need some fiat. The goal of the entire mining system is for this sum to be very close to the mining reward: however at the moment the best estimates I've seen indicate that this is only 30% or so of their costs. 
Miners also have to pay taxes on their earnings, but only when they convert to fiat. This gives them an incentive to hold and then sell at a date in which they can match ongoing or new expenditures. Otherwise I don't think they'd stay in Bitcoin unless they worried about flooding the market: their company already exposes them to a big Bitcoin valuation risk, why exacerbate that?
I think it's probable that miners are avoiding taxes, and that's part of why they stopped selling equipment. Staying purely digital makes it easier to manage tax subterfuge. Shipping things across borders leaves a big paper trail. Just my theory though, miners are secretive 
@_date: 2016-04-29 03:25:39

Economic influence is not control. And this influence is an unfortunate practical trade-off, not a desirable aspect of Bitcoin. 
If the fiat exchanges decided to change consensus rules, maybe that would cause enough pain that people would think about changing. Does that mean Coinbase controls Bitcoin? 
Only if you let them. Only if you are ruled by fear. And that is what Gavin and these other guys are peddling: fear of destruction. Same as government control. Except this time the destruction cannot damage you, except economically. So if you are able to accept that, you can have a free Bitcoin where you are your own master. Not a miner, not a government, you.

I like Satoshi's original idea: keep things no trust and p2p. I like the cypherpunk idea of crypto anarchy, everyone just does what they personally want and can't force others to change. 
I'd see this as a difference between positive rights and negative rights. I think you have a negative right to broadcast a transaction: no one can stop you. I don't believe in positive rights: that you have a right for someone else to pick up your transaction. Your freedom ends where mine starts

The Ledger Blue has this, although you can only get the dev version of it
Having a screen and buttons on the Trezor is definitely great, but I don't think it's good for casual use because the screen quality and user experience is so poor. Good design is important to security because it has to be accessible and unobtrusive or you get alarm blindness or don't bother using it. I haven't bought a Ledger but it looks like they are going in the right direction there, whereas Trezor is standing still.
Since Coinbase became evil, I've tried to set up a couple family members with Trezors so they can hold their own coins. They are not technical and the usability was just terrible for them: they couldn't understand it easily. So if they want to access their coins they have to get me or potentially do something insecure? That's not what I want to see happening.

The only control they have is for ordering transactions. They determine the order in which transactions are in the Blockchain. They control only that and no more.
They are not the gatekeepers. And the actual users of Bitcoin can make all the current miners totally irrelevant with a single update. 
In a vision where miners control Bitcoin, that also means that government can pinpoint these handful of individuals and control them. Which means that Bitcoin can be government controlled, which means Bitcoin would likely suffer the same fate as all other threats to governments' power over money. It's a self destructive vision: a death cult.
Bitcoin should be governed by math, no trust, no middlemen. That is the actual project vision that makes sense

The TPS limit isn't the real barrier to Amazon or a big company accepting Bitcoin, LN won't fix that.
The real barrier is adoption on the other side. Only a small number of people have Bitcoin, an even smaller number get paid in Bitcoin. 
The question is on the consumer side, not the merchant side. Why would I as a consumer hold and spend Bitcoin?
- I have to stomach volatility risk
- I have to be responsible for my own security 
- I have to use complicated software

Again, there is no proof of this "majority of active users". I could just as easily say the majority of active users opposed these attacks, and I'd have the same level of evidence you do.
Not to mention that doing whatever a majority wants no matter the situation or what is right and wrong doesn't make sense.
And you might consider that "censorship" is opposed to what Bitcoin stands for, but you don't get to decide that for other people. For me, Bitcoin stands for not giving in to mob rule, and so moderation is certainly in line with what Bitcoin stands for.

I'm sure of your use case but you might consider the 2:2 multisig approach:
1. Merchant and Customer form a new multisig wallet
2. Customer funds the wallet
3. Merchant ships the goods
4. Customer sends funds from the wallet to the merchant's personal wallet
Failure Scenarios:
1. Merchant ships goods but customer still does not release funds
2. Customer funds wallet but merchant does not ship the goods
In scenario 1 customer doesn't get his funds back, so he might as well release. In scenario 2 the merchant didn't get any funds, he might as well cancel.
You could require both sides to pay a bit extra into the shared wallet to make the failure to cooperate scenario a bit more painful

This seems like a strawman - naturally tools can assist people make the type of transactions they wish to make. And I think plenty of Bitcoiners are already using wallets that can send to a P2SH address, my guess would be 99 out of 100

I'm talking about things where people have something go wrong with their paper wallet. People tend to mess it up, and I think it's because it's overly complicated. HD seeds are so plain and simple, I think it's easier to avoid errors and more obvious what to do to keep it secure.
Using a paper wallet there are various things that can go wrong:
- Printer has a cache
- Accidentally include private QR in a photo or video
- Reuse the address for multiple transactions
- Lose one of multiple pieces of paper (more papers, more to lose)
- Forget to dispose of the paper wallet properly after sweeping
- Import the private key instead of sweeping
- Only make one printout of the wallet and lose that printout
- Accidentally send change to a paper wallet and think you lost it
- Accidentally re-send or send change to a paper wallet that you disposed of
The one thing I do like about paper wallets is that it's more probable that the format will maintain consistency and ubiquity over time

It will look like depositing into a multisig wallet. You can try that using CoPay or Electrum - it works pretty similarly to a normal wallet.


It should be able to, that is a very simple case


There is no need to open new channels in a normal situation. Everyone should be linked together in the network, similar to how if I want to send you a file over the Internet, it goes over a bunch of relays in the middle who pass along the file until it reaches you. Sometimes it might not work, like if you are trying to send a big file but the relays to the person are too weak and the bandwidth makes sending over the Internet not feasible. In that case you need to send another way.
So I don't see why you'd ever need to open up channels to specifically transact, since you can fail back to a normal Blockchain transaction, or some other mechanism.

You can still send old style transactions, if the person you are sending to has a 1xxx address. Nothing changes there.
There are still some people who are against the 3xxx style addresses. Those people can still be paid, even from people who use multisig. That's because funds and transactions are two separate things. Transactions were designed to be extensible, using a script system that would be upgradable in the future.

Personally I think that these guys are victims of their own avarice, and they have a philosophy of individualism that is so extreme that it makes them anti-social.

Transactions aren't guaranteed to be in any block, let alone the next one. For example if you send a transaction without a fee, it might be ignored forever
Blocks are found using a random guessing process, there is no telling if someone will find the right guess quickly or slowly. I think 2 hours is a good safe time to allow for a long run of bad luck, but it could even be 3 hours. 
What you could do is put a red dot on your painting and indicate it is sold. Then the buyer can come pick it up later when his transaction has cleared.

No, I consider what Bitcoin is to be a personal decision, and I'd call it "crypto-anarchy". Everyone decides for themselves, including if they decide that they want it to be a radical form of democracy. Anyone can make it up for themselves.


Yeah the software, meaning the cryptographic methods that verify what is considered to be valid Bitcoin. That's all I want to trust: math.


I think permissionlessness is basically the same thing as not having middlemen, so it's very important and desirable.
I think a moderately larger block size does compromise decentralization + trustlessness to some degree, based on the data that I've seen - it would degrade the network. I don't think it would compromise decentralization and trustlessness completely, just to some degree. But it has some pros as well, so I think a balanced approach is best

I'd think about how to make it difficult for someone to compromise my safety: meeting in a public place, etc. I haven't seen anyone ever have any problems if they set their trades up in a safe way. You can also start small and judge the person you trade with to see if they seem like a risk.

I think you mean the Blockchain. The Blockchain is not designed to be a more efficient payment network than the world's existing networks: it is designed to be a p2p way to transfer value.
Because of the speed of light limitations that are inherent to the Blockchain's design, there's really no way in this universe that the current design could ever be a realistic head to head competitor to centralized payment networks.
To address this we can:
- Change the fundamental design of the Blockchain to remove the speed of light limitations (Bitcoin NG)
- Give up on decentralization of the Blockchain (PoS)
- Find a way to change the fundamental laws of the universe (Oculus Rift)
- Reduce the geographic area of the population of humans to a small enough area where the limitation is not meaningful (Trump)
- Add complementary networks to Bitcoin that do not have this limitation but are still p2p (Lightning)
- Use centralized networks and avoid p2p unless needed (Changetip)
Bitcoin as a currency unit is separate from the Blockchain, which is a network designed to move the currency unit. If you hand someone a dollar bill or you PayPal it to them, you are using two different mechanisms to transfer the same currency unit. Bitcoin's value is digital scarcity, it's in the currency unit itself. The Blockchain is great, but its value is in p2p transactions. Both are great concepts, but they are not the same thing.

Masternodes are centralized and lightning is not
It's certain that there will be all in one LN and Bitcoin wallets, I'd expect that to be the norm. Core might take a while to get there because there isn't much volunteer work on improving it
LN uses the Bitcoin blockchain, but there will be a separate set of cached data which will either be in the cloud somehow or you will have to keep it, if you are receiving funds that is
If you want to run a LN relay there will likely be rewards commensurate with your capital and relay configuration, but a very minimal bottom limit for getting started with relaying. It will be market based and p2p and not centralized like the masternodes concept or the existing federated trusted entity models we have today

What type of transaction you use depends on your preference, double is just an estimate of the average gain. It can be up to 4x of an improvement
Personally I'd like to see everyone using SegWit and multisig as soon as possible, I think it's the best configuration of Bitcoin.

I'm less bullish in the short term because I see hurdles to clear before we can begin sustainably ascending:
1. Some of current mining pools are unlike anything we've seen before: they are acting like criminals, irrational and unpredictable. We need the ASIC race to end and for mining to be more distributed. I think this will happen but take time
2. Many of the VC investments don't have the patience to wait for Bitcoin's time to shine. From their perspective it needs to go big soon or they will start pulling the plugs. That's just how the VC guys operate. When this VC wave crashes fully there will be some undertow and despair. The wave seems to have crested but not yet crashed
3. There are barbarians at the gates led by who want to tear down our edifice of no-trust and replace it with a centralized, bastardized version of itself. They don't share in the founding ideology of the project and are simply short term opportunists. We need to roust these people and strengthen the foundations of security to ensure they must pay a higher price if they wish to darken our doorstep in the future. More and more people are recognizing that this threat is inevitable and real and so there are long term efforts underway to erect additional strong countermeasures.
I feel like time is on our side though: sudden changes are often met with violent backlashes and good software cannot be rushed.

Transactions are included by miners but not necessarily verified, for example a miner could include an invalid transaction in a block


Only one miner gets one block. So get all the fees and all the 25 block reward (12.5 soon)


Confirmations is another word for a block. Because the blocks build on each other as you mentioned, the more blocks that come along the more "confirmed" it is considered because to remove the transaction from history would require a greater number of blocks, which would be costly to create


Bitcoin doesn't use encryption, it uses cryptography which isn't quite the same thing. If the cryptography algorithms break, they would break all sorts of things like pretty much any website or App that allows you to sign in to your account for example. Of course we'd probably work out some other algorithm and be fine in the end. Much of what secures Bitcoin isn't cryptography at all, but just standard math: if math breaks then yeah maybe it's brown trousers time

This makes it sound like $0.07 is the necessary fee, which wouldn't be accurate. For example if you watch cointape you can see that people are simply overpaying, which makes sense if you consider that the current software to calculate fees isn't perfect and the amount of overpayment is pretty trivial.
To improve, I would use the historical data to show the lowest they could have paid if they had perfect information, and also include cointape's estimate to show how software could be improved, their estimate seems to be the most accurate.
The other thing about fees is that next block fees is unnecessary for many many uses of Bitcoin, and targeting even a few blocks later results in a big fee difference.
Personally I almost always always overpay, because I feel it's no big deal. Sometimes for a low priority transaction I will use the lowest estimated fee from Bitcoin Core and that always goes through after a while, and is much cheaper.

Objectively they have lost people's money, their security practices are bad and people report getting their money stolen from there quite often, they encourage bad practices like address re-use, they are quite buggy and implement things incompletely: they even once falsely reported Satoshi's coins moved.
People tried for a long time to get them to fix their stuff, especially when they were more popular, or even just to keep publish the current source code when they said they were open source. They've taken money under false pretenses for their "shared send" service, which was so buggy it provided pretty much zero privacy.

My goal isn't to convince anyone, people can decide for themselves. I just want the facts to be known, and to counter the huge misinformation and coercion campaign to try and trick people into going against their own interest
The facts speak for themselves, these scare tactic scenarios of blocks being too full or not full enough, fees being too high or not high enough, if you repeat them enough times and people see how ridiculous they are, they lose their power. 
If you want to make a transaction, you pay a small fee: pennies, even half a penny is still working for me. Soon, the fees will be even smaller than small. Those are the facts.

I don't think this makes sense
People always have to hold Bitcoin, except for the tiny minority amount that is in transit for an hour. The difference would be an additional small incentive to park funds in a hot wallet instead of a cold wallet
Additionally, think how much fees make every day: like $20k. Now think how much people gain or lose in a day by sitting in Bitcoin, collectively it's so much more: millions of dollars. So people will have a small extra incentive to park their funds in coins, but volatility risk is still so much bigger that it will probably still not make a big difference, unless transaction counts and spending really blows up when LN hits the scene.

No one was ever in charge of the code. People simply made changes to the code, in various repositories. Satoshi never even commit to the Github repository, despite being the main coder. Neither Gavin nor Satoshi made the Github repository, it was created by another guy. There are no "keys" to the repository, it's Github and it doesn't even use a "keys" based system. The alert keys were given to multiple people. 
Gavin helped package and release for a while, contributed a few non-essential features and was involved with the publicity aspect of the project. He was involved with the project at a very early date, although in the early days his contributions to the code base were very superficial. 
Gavin himself came up with the idea that he was the leader, there's no source other than Gavin himself that Satoshi wanted that. spun incidental facts about his early contributions to the project to pretend that Satoshi chose him as a second in command and trusted him with the future vision of the project, when in fact that never actually happened. His motivation for this deception is narcissism, self-aggrandizement and his financial benefit.

I don't see why it would make much difference, they would simply be exchanging it into fiat right? The only difference I can see is that it would go a little farther to pushing for a closed loop of Bitcoin payments where they can pressure their employees and suppliers to accept Bitcoin, but I think the writing is on the wall that that is an uphill battle of inches
Personally I love the Shift VISA card concept, you can pretty much hold zero fiat and have no problems living your normal life. If you want Tesla employees to start to feel that they could possibly accept a Bitcoin salary, giving them the possibility to spend that money anywhere VISA is accepted sounds like a great way to attack the same problem from the other side

No, fees never reached tens of pennies, that never happened


Says who? I say fees are acceptable and possibly essential to making the system work at all in the long run


Just look at the records: even miners like Bitfury said it was an attack. Look at the huge increases in transactions that came very suddenly and dropped off very suddenly. Look at the convenient timing. Look at how the transactions were just insanely long chains folding back on themselves. These pieces of evidence point to attack


Some systems are setup in a way where they will find equilibrium. It will be hard to destroy Bitcoin because the genie is out of the bottle: the equilibrium is for people to use it. It may take time, but the concept is out there


Tx demand always exceeds capacity. Even one person can make that true: hey I decided I want all the space. Now demand exceeds capacity. The network is designed to work fine with increased demand by increasing fees. I think it will work. I even think that block size change as a response is an option on the table if the fees do go too high.


Just look at the fees paid over time. Look at the transactions without ones that are chains of ten thousand, without the thousands of transactions that are paying only a few satoshis per byte. The numbers show that the fees for standard transactions look to remain flat or only adjust upwards slightly until capacity increases


Just because people did it before, doesn't mean they will always do it. To ensure that fees are required and not just convention, people need a solid benefit for paying them, and miners need a solid benefit for charging them. That's just simple logic based on the assumption that people will generally act in their self interest.


The miners are not one entity and for them to act as one entity for fee charging they would have to go against their own self interest, so that is difficult to rely on. A stable system of fees must be designed in which miners are self interested to not charge zero fees


Bitcoin requires this planning. It's not central though, everyone can make up their own plan as they see fit. Economic planning and the plan to make fees pay for the system are the same thing

It's not the intent of Bitcoin to enable this use case, it's just a side consequence. Bitcoin was created to counter the power of the state, and the state isn't all bad, so we'll see some negative consequences along those lines. If you give people free speech, some of them will abuse the privilege.
If you want to play the unintended consequences game though: consider that these hacked systems weren't made vulnerable by Bitcoin. They were likely getting hacked before, or at least targets that could be attacked. Imagine if the hospital that was targeted for ransom ware was hit by ISIS and lives were lost. Does the ransom seem like a cheap price to pay to prevent those deaths by giving a wake up call to their security?
We can't determine all the consequences of everything, and it's futile to fight a new technology just because it brings  some inconvenient changes. The right thing to do is to make the best of it and not wring your hands about the negative consequences that always accompany any change in anything

A fee market that yielded very low fee transactions could still work with bigger blocks, depending on the elasticity of the market and the overall usage of Bitcoin. For example if there was a 100x rise in usage and a 20x rise in max block size we could see similar block profits for miners to contemporary profits (not that contemporary profits are the low bar) and still expect fees similar to our current fees

Zero fee transactions can be delayed so much they will leave the mempool and no miner will include them. Also, there is no system to set the minimum possible fee because you might set a fee that is close to zero fee and it will have the same problem: stuck transactions
Major Bitcoin clients can easily be patched to indicate the RBF flag
Miners can give a grace period to the merchant ecosystem to allow them to adjust to the RBF flag before they start respecting it. That will give people plenty of time to adjust
No, core devs have stated publicly they see bigger blocks as part of a potential solution to the real problem which is making it easier to have more transactions per second using Bitcoin.
Opt-in RBF should actually make it easier and cheaper for a normal transaction to get into a block (at any block size) since the low priority transactions will no longer be competing for the high priority space

I think companies are still the best investment because they can create new wealth that never existed through innovation. 
However not everyone has access to investing in companies, young people, people in the wrong country, too poor to afford a share, can't afford to keep money in something not immediately liquid. 
Bitcoin then is the best universal store of wealth we've ever seen, something that anyone from a shopkeeper in Bangladesh to a child in the UK to a woman in Afghanistan to an old man in Venezuela can all acquire and can all call their own. Bitcoin tokens create no new wealth, but they also do not leak wealth to third party keepers and managers, which is something we haven't truly seen before

There is evidence: tests that have shown that larger blocks would have negative consequences. And every active developer on the Bitcoin project except for maybe jgarzik is saying we should be careful about raising the block size.
I'm not arguing for higher fees. I don't want higher fees. I just want the lowest fees that are possible while maintaining the essential properties of the network. Transaction rate on another network is nothing to fear, the existing transaction networks already do far more transactions. Hash rate attacks are also not a big issue, they are hard to make profitable, they are arguably illegal, and they can be defended against through proof of work changes. And the worst that happens if another blockchain wins and is decentralized is that we have a crypto currency that won, so we still win.
I want to lower fees for sure. I want to see the lowest possible fees. I don't think it's a major problem now since the fees are pennies, but the lower the better. Raising the blocksize without regard for the consequences of that decision is just not the right way to lower the fees

While the money is locked you can use it, you can even unlock it, as long as the person you locked it with isn't screwing you over, which they have little reason to since the worst they can do to you is make you wait
I think at this point it's too early to do any calculations on what Lightning or even the future Bitcoin network will cost without an upfront statement: "Everything is very hand-wavey".

What is the logic of why increasing the block size couldn't wait for the higher fees to appear? Is there false urgency, can Bitcoin not weather some tough times if things don't go perfectly all the time?
Another thing to think about is that there are other limitations that make increasing the number of transactions difficult. Removing the hard limit won't necessarily increase the number of transactions hugely right?
I think the argument is being presented is that there is a single config variable in Bitcoin that can be quickly solved with a hard fork and all the developers of Bitcoin are just stubborn for whatever reason and don't want to solve it with this one quick fix that will fix it forever

There's no way to generate value, only value tokens that can be used to represent value. If you generated unlimited numbers of tokens and gave them out to people, there's no reason to believe they would be worth $100k/year and no algorithm that could guarantee that they would be.
Generating unlimited numbers of tokens is equivalent to taking value away from the current holders of tokens, so you'd have to get people to agree voluntarily to buy things that would lose value

Fixing an accidental hard fork and intentionally creating a probably contentious hard fork are two separate things entirely, you can't conflate them
Calling something an altcoin is not vilifying it, it's just describing it.
As far as testing, only recently were any tests done other than in crude and flawed simulations by Gavin. No tests have been done to see what will happen when 8gb blocks appear. Peer review is not the same as appeal to authority.
If you switch to an altcoin without any devs, it won't be maintained as well. XT has already allowed in a buffer overflow attack. It also won't add as many features as it diverges and needs development to keep merging in copied changes
@_date: 2015-12-09 17:58:51
Divided we fall is the biggest problem for me, for example we saw a buffer overflow vulnerability checked into XT because there's no dev team there preventing that. I have my problems with the dev team's impractical idealism and sometimes fatalism, but they are out there coding which is huge. You're right that testing is contributing, but even the tests seem to be pushed about as political props instead of being positioned as peer reviewed studies

The scalability issue is valid. But you're right: unity is the bigger picture, a network effect lives and dies by its population size. Unity is also why it's such a crazy bad idea to try and force the issue by creating an altcoin and forking the name and history of Bitcoin into two coins, one with a dev team and one without. That disaster waiting to happen is so much more dangerous to bitcoin's growth than any block limit.
The community's concerns were manufactured by a propaganda campaign devised by Mike Hearn to demonize "the other side" so he could win power at any cost. He claimed that the core devs are not working in the interest of Bitcoin, but didn't prove that and every available piece of evidence points against those spurious claims.
If someone publishes lies about you, they are just trying to suck you in to a game of denials. That's a losing game. If some jerk says oh that guy is a child molester, you don't go on your Twitter and post, "all claims of me being a child molester are false"
Bitcoin's dev team does need a mouthpiece, they are technical people and explaining technicals to enthusiasts is hard just like its hard for a Bitcoin enthusiast to explain Bitcoin to an average joe. The problem is that mouthpiece they used to use started getting full of himself and started believing his own press and now is going against the dev team. I can understand why they are reticent to recruit another mouthpiece.
The Bitcoin dev team doesn't run the currency Bitcoin. Your implication that they do is not correct. They make improvements to the reference client, that other people read about and sometimes choose to install. They have no further control over any aspect of the currency.
There aren't any alt-coins that are not scams - except for proof of concept and test coins like test-net. Although I don't deny the possibility of a legit alt-coin appearing: it just hasn't happened yet. Why would it? If you want the mission of Bitcoin to succeed, making alt coins is just fighting that mission

Then there would be censorship of securities present that could be routed around by using a decentralized system, there would be no central company to get in trouble for facilitating Russians buying and selling US stocks.

I'm not saying that fees should be high, just that they must be high if demand outpaces the supply available. I want a bigger block size and thus lower fees: after all it's me paying the fees not getting them. However I also don't want to pay the cost that a bigger block size would present. Changing that parameter is not without cost. 
It's just unfortunate that increasing the supply of transactions available will have a cost. Someone has to pay it, it can't just be wished away. If no one pays it, the supply won't increase.
As far as "Internet of Things" use, I think it's all very theoretical. I'd like to see more real life examples before I think it will really become something, and it's definitely not the basis for why I value Bitcoin, it's just an interesting idea that might or might not have potential.
All the various use cases might have promise on the Blockchain, but you can't put the cart before the horse of saying we must have these things so we must pretend as if we are able to support these things.
The reason why those use cases are even mentioned as possible is not because the Blockchain can do many transactions per second. It is because the Blockchain remains a permission-less, decentralized network. Damaging the decentralized nature of the Blockchain will close those doors.

If having a block size had a chilling effect, it didn't stop things so far: it's been in place a very long time now. Only a few mining pools even bother to lift their soft cap to hit the hard limit.
You may be new to Bitcoin but fees were never predictable. Before dynamic fees we used static fees and those static fees were all over the place because of price variance. Years ago in the $1200 rally fees were more than triple what they are today. If anything the dynamic fees should be more predictable since they more accurately model what people will pay. Dynamic fees when introduced actually dropped the fee dramatically on day one and has never increased except during a few heavy use times.
No one introduced a fee market. The devs didn't add something to your client and say "now you have a fee market magically". The fee market is an emergent property of what was there all along
If the cost is subtle, this subtle urgent emergency which is so subtle we can't point to any ill effects, is it possible it's so subtle we can just ignore it?
The thing about a core dev wanting small blocks: that's the default and actually kind of a mischaracterization since they've all said they thought changing the block size could be a potential improvement if necessary. That's like me saying I don't want to go and get a burger for lunch, I'll stay home and make nachos. It doesn't mean I'm going to stop you going to get a burger, I just don't want it myself at this moment.
If you have questions about Lightning, I don't see them hiding what it is, you can read the white paper and see the early code, post to the dev list and irc, etc. personally I don't think Lightning is the right solution but I'm happy to have more options as long as they don't reduce my current options

Altcoin stands for alternative coin. If a Bitcoin fork is contentious, it will result in two coins: a merchant would have to specify on their invoice which fork coins they wanted. Therefore any contentious fork of Bitcoin regardless of genesis block status is an alternative coin since it has its own history that is separate, that's what makes it its own coin. It's like if everyone drinks coca cola and then some person comes out with pepsi, you can't just serve pepsi to someone without asking if pepsi is ok, which of course it is not.

What response could be taken by a concerted attack? Hard fork to a new proof of work or wait out the attack
Personally I think having many miners still isn't a panacea against miners abusing their power. Plenty of time angry mobs of people do stupid and wrong things. 
The weapon against miners is the strength of the individual nodes. The stronger that weapon is, the less chance of it needing to be used

It will start adjusting quite quickly and any of the pools could carry out an attack almost immediately
For example if a Bitcoin gambling site was found out to have an out of date node (lazy operator or bug), a mining pool could easily mine some double spend blocks to con them out of some Bitcoin
Sometimes miners themselves forget to update all their nodes, very recently we had some pool miners going back and forth on soft fork voting. In this way they could even enable a double spend by mistake

Lightning works more like how the Internet routes stuff. You have some big routers and small routers, but all that matters is finding a least jumps path through
What I've heard proposed is that when you send a transaction you encode the route you choose using cryptography so that each step in the chain only knows who he will send to, not the final destination. So each jump knows who relayed it to them and where to relay next, but not the origin or route or destination

Most fiat transactions can be associated with you, so there'd probably be a record of your identity getting $200k in fiat. Even if you got it in cash, would you put it in your mattress? Would you always spend it in a way that's not attached to your identity? If they questioned the guy who gave you the fiat would he remember what you look like or where you met, maybe a security camera took a photo of you or your car
The IP address is possible but quite unlikely, transactions don't contain the IP address of the person who made them. If you sent your bitcoins from Coinbase then your IP address is almost certainly recorded. Some improvements coming soon will make the reference client obscure IP addresses more but this is not a likely way to be identified at the moment

I think there's a distinction between discussing something and promoting something. I think discussion should be allowed, but promotion should be barred, from a purely signal to noise perspective.
For example Litecoin, that uses a different proof of work that some say is superior. Well is it? Why can't we have a thread every day from all the Litecoin boosters about how their proof of work is superior? Because it's noisy. Blocking noise is not censorship. It's fine to have a /crypto forum and a /bitcoin forum and for one to be less permissive than the other 
In your definition of what an altcoin is


I find that definition actually very limited. What if we found a problem with originating from the genesis block? Time to fold up shop? What if a government overpowered the mining companies and forced them to only include approved transactions? No way to switch?
I'm happy for the door to be open to alternative implementations, but I'm not happy for that openness to be abused to shove through changes that don't forward the mission. So as it relates to censorship, I'm happy to discuss making alternatives to Bitcoin, potential hard forks, etc, but I'm not happy to hear people promoting things that are not a part of the Bitcoin mission like a hard fork client that happens to use the Bitcoin genesis block and proof of work but creates a centralized currency.

I reject any call to push or pressure another person to change their node or to code something they can't believe in or want. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 09:32:41
Well for starters a miner doesn't know what a super majority of nodes has seen, they just know what they themselves have seen. They also have no idea which of two transactions was broadcast first, since there is no way to reliably tell that. The merchant doesn't know what the miner will see first either
Imagine a network heavy use situation, someone is attacking the network by sending millions of transactions through. All but the most well equipped nodes start discarding transactions from their memory pool to continue operating. Now I send two spends, one with a low fee that will be thrown out by most nodes, but with enough fee to get through to a miner. Then I re-send a high fee transaction that will get propagated to most nodes and they wont' throw it out because they forgot about the low fee one. Now I pretend to the merchant like the high fee transaction is real, but actually the low fee one goes through.
Zero conf can roughly work for many cases but cannot ever work well for all cases and should never be relied upon for a serious amount of money where theft is a possibility.

As I mentioned, free energy sources would be necessarily limited, so no one could use that power to dominate the entire market.
There's even going to be miners who always run their miners at a loss, either by mistake or on purpose for no good reason.
By bumpy I mean there may be a long period where blocks take a long time.
The proposed preventative might be mostly the same as the potential cure at the time of the incident: hard fork. If this really is calamitous, it would be limited in scope because a hard fork could just force a difficulty reset.

On chain micropayments are probably dead until we have huge leaps in tech improvements: there's no way to know if you're publishing a home video or a billion micropayments to the blockchain. Obviously we can't have every full node also having to sync everyone else's arbitrary files so there has to be some importance filter (fees and dust limit)
Off chain micropayments denominated in Bitcoin are possible through payment channels and custodial wallets

Let's say that I'm a business, how do I tell the miners what max block size I prefer? Let's say I'm a small business and I can only host a small full node. How do I tell them or pressure them to not make blocks that will make me have to buy better hardware?  I personally enjoy having my own node and if I have to give it up, I want to have a good reason or benefit for doing that.
The SPV clients don't know that they are broken because they don't know which side of the hard fork is correct. They don't even know a hard fork happened. There's a theorized way to fix this but it's never been implemented so it may or may not be possible to correct, aside from just trusting some other people to run a full node. I think some recent changes in Segwit could potentially pave the way for SPV mode to be much stronger, but more work needs to be done.
I wish we did have a thought leader who everyone got behind, even if it did mean some degree of centralized influence, I don't think all centralization is bad as long as there are some checks. But we don't have that person, we're missing Satoshi really

In other commodities there are not many successful cartels that have been successful in the long term, they are difficult to sustain because of the game theory problem where people will be rewarded for betraying the cartel.
In mining I'd expect that a high price for transactions would also encourage alternatives and thus be self defeating.
Finite blocks are quite popular amongst even Gavin and Mike.

First you lock your funds in a bitcoin transaction that uses a smart contract to make sure that you can get your money back if the other party betrays you and makes sure to them that you can't spend your funds on the blockchain for that period.
This creates a trusted channel where you can now constantly send transactions that don't need to hit the network except before the refund tx runs out.
So let's say you wanted to pay someone by the minute. Every minute you would send them a new signed transaction that pays them more money. So first you send payment for minute 1, then minute 2, etc. They can just discard the minute 1 transaction.
Basically between the two of you, you keep an ongoing record of your balance, and the record is actually a transaction. When you are done you can tell the channel to close and the person you are paying can actually submit that transaction to the blockchain. Now 300 minutes worth of payments are folded into one payment. Also since signatures can be sent in internet time, there is no need to wait for a confirmation when confirming another minute's worth of payment

The Chinese miners pushed back on a 20 MB proposal saying that it was too risky. They proposed 8 MB and have stated they can support a higher block size, however 8 MB is pushing it and they've said that they prefer a Bitcoin Core version if possible.
Hard forks are tricky, so far we've just used them for emergency bug fixing, except for some early Satoshi bug fixing hard forks when much less was at stake if something went wrong.
Even more than miners not wanting a larger block size and not wanting to create a consensus rift, it may be that a larger block size forces a centralization of the network that is detrimental to the core mission of Bitcoin which is to remain decentralized. You can easily see this by considering a scenario where if tomorrow we got 10 GB blocks every ten minutes, there would be few who could afford to run a full node, node count would dwindle and the network would be more centralized.

The reason it's not so bad is because you aren't locked into Coinbase. There's no big difference between you converting Bitcoin to fiat to spend at a merchant and a merchant using a Bitcoin payment processor to convert Bitcoin to fiat.

Th problem with the moderation is that there wasn't solid moderation before and so the policies were unclear, it was something of a free for all which people reveled in to some degree. 
I vastly prefer a moderated forum with clear boundaries, even if some of them are dumb or too strict because it removes the problems of advertising and trolling which basically turn any popular forum without moderation into YouTube comments.
Now we have the double whammy of a death cult trying to attack the Bitcoin devs and normal forum users adjusting to the sudden moderation change.
The moderation rules need to be clarified to avoid a chilling effect, also moderators should try and avoid abusing their power to silence dissent even if the dissent is stupid or wrong, as long as the dissent is honest and not trolling or spamming. With the vote brigading that has been happening it is difficult to let facts be downvoted and agenda serving distortions upvoted, but two wrongs can't make a right

Both bugs and bad habits are really hard to avoid
For example: if you use multibit you are revealing all your addresses to every node you connect to, if you use mycelium you are revealing all your addresses to the Mycelium corporation. Both of these could easily keep logs, tying all your addresses together. Now you buy $500 of coins on coinjar and then do some TOR + joinmarket and then you spend $500 on a delivery to your Australian address. To find your identity I can just look at the things you can't control: I can ask Mycelium corp for the list of all your addresses, I can ask the company accepting bitcoin or their payment processor for a record of all $500 sales and I can cross reference that with coinjar's $500 buys to get your ID. Even if I'm missing stuff in the middle, there are clues that can be put together, and a computer running correlation analysis algorithms can do this better than a person ever could imagine

I haven't seen anyone really write anything up about it, but it seems like Coinbase keeps two of three keys and two of three are necessary to spend. Also they don't use an open source App to manage your keys. 
So they could compromise the software or they could just spend your money with their two keys (or a hacker could). Not really much different from storing your coin on their exchange directly

That vision only makes sense up until the limit of the mining reward and it's going to be super volatile.
Let's imagine a product with the 21 chip inside it: the "Celebrity alarm clock". It's an standalone alarm clock where you can set an alarm, set your name and set a phrase to wake up to and then a celebrity will say a message to wake you up (they will be compensated with the bitcoin your alarm clock mines). So if the 21 theory is correct this should be possible to sell off the shelf without the person ever knowing about Bitcoin.
Except if they sell too many of these things, there will be too much competition for the mining reward and each unit won't earn enough. Or the price drops or the mining difficulty jumps, there are many ways where the unit won't earn enough Bitcoin. I guess you could program in a big safety margin, but it would still be a very risky product to sell if your margin estimations were incorrect. And all of this assumes a marginal mining chip cost of zero, which could also mess up your calculations
I think these kind of products could also easily get a bad reputation as somehow tricking you into a higher electricity bill because this isn't something people are used to

I'm saying that I've been hearing this fee is going to explode stuff for 6 months now. I've heard numbers like $20, etc. I think it's fear mongering that weakens the credibility of the entire argument.
There is a lot about Bitcoin that is uncertain. When you have $10k worth of coin today that could be worth $5k tomorrow, I think you are stupid to give two shits if tomorrow you have to pay $0.15 instead of $0.04 to send a Bitcoin transaction. I think that $0.04 being low gives us a lot of breathing room, the fee could explode by 10x and you could still use Bitcoin six times a day for the price of a NYC subway ticket.
Core doesn't have any veto power, that's just not how this works. They make software, that is open source. If other people want to use it, or modify it, that's up to them, they can do anything they want free of charge. Core doesn't control what people do with the software they make. 
If Core developers feel that they don't want to change the code to do something or other for any reason whatsoever, that's their right.

They do not use the same blockchain. BIP 101 has its own blockchain that has the same genesis block but it is separate
Clients will only use the longest chain if the validity rules are followed in the longest chain, that's why miners can't print new Bitcoins for themselves or change other fundamental rules
Reorganizations in the block chain are not the same thing because the validity rules are unchanged
@_date: 2015-12-28 06:26:01
The point is that you might reject a better realization of the actual mission of Bitcoin because it doesn't follow some arbitrary rule in your head about using the same proof of work. That's your choice, but I'm more interested in the mission than the proof of work algorithm which to me is just incidental and can be changed. What can't change for me is the mission of a decentralized currency, that's why I'm not a fan of bip101 and consider an implementation of it to be off mission and thus an alternative currency. You're welcome to it though, I just don't agree

You're free to your opinions about what you want to see in a client you want to run yourself, but you can't tell other people what software to run or what software they have to code. No coder owes you anything, unless you paid them to code something for you
The problem with expanding the limit is that there are technical risks and problems with expanding it. Fees are not the point, technical consequences of expanding it is the point.
The block reward subsidy will remain quite large for decades

The thing is, there's a bigger threat to Bitcoin than factional infighting and that's potentially not achieving mainstream appeal. Unless you actively want to destroy Bitcoin, as long as you want some part of it to succeed there is a lot of common ground and it's easy to get drawn into factional arguments that ignore the bigger picture.
I do agree that 5000x is not an entirely accurate estimate for the reason you state: Bitcoin has the potential to not just replace every existing transaction in the world but even create exponentially more transactions that currently occur in the world today. My point is more that given the current fee of pennies we still have a lot of room for that to occur and a lot of people have to join and a lot of increased use has to happen for us to really feel that using Bitcoin is "out of reach" vs just annoyingly costly.

This is a falsely framed argument. It says there's a choice between Lightning or unconfirmed transactions + low fees but there is no choice. Unconfirmed transactions will never be secure, that's the entire point of the proof of work system. There are also other options under development to reduce fees, plus as fees rise, a market opportunity is created for services that allow people to avoid paying fees, putting a limit on how much fees will rise.

The best reason to run a full node as a business is for security, the full node will verify everything without any need to depend on a third party.
If you want your outgoing transactions to have priority, increase the attached fee.

It's unknown, you should not leave your coins with a 3rd party if you can help it.
Worst case, Bitcoin splits into 2 coins: A and B. BitGo chooses B, and they only credit you with B coins instead of giving you both balances. You lose all your A coins. You withdraw your B coins and then trade them for A coins at a 50% loss, but then A coins make a comeback and B coins become worthless. Now you've lost 50% of your coins.

I view this social contract differently. 
Instead of a low fee system, I see a decentralized system as the contract. It's clear to me that huge blocks like 10GB could easily make for a system in which centralization was inescapable, certainly today, very possibly in the future too.
However I agree that block size itself is not in the social contract, and I also don't see any way that some upward change to the blocksize would fundamentally change any decentralization properties.
I think expecting people to change something otherwise they are breaking a contract is unfair. These devs aren't paid by you, why can you demand that they do something. They never even promised to do another day's work on Bitcoin, tomorrow they could stop. That's why I reject the idea that no change is forcing change.

Bytecoin is also missing a lot of features that Bitcoin has added and the tools are behind of course since it's not a fork it's hard to adapt Bitcoin tools to Bytecoin

Bitcoin core does have a dynamic fee calculator that has saved me some pennies on transactions. Recently I've sent a $0.003 transaction using Bitcoin core and it went through without issue.

1. You can't invoice in credit card and receive in Bitcoin because the credit card transactions take six months to finalize and until that point they can be withdrawn. Bitcoin takes minutes to finalize so it's incompatible
2. Don't use any web wallets, choose a software or hardware one at Bitcoin.org
3. If you use an HD wallet (most are) you can simply write down a recovery phrase and that's the only backup you need
4. Wallets generate new addresses on demand and you can't run out, the wallet also deals with other annoyances like change, so you can focus on sending and receiving and your overall balance. A good wallet will mostly take care of the new address stuff for you

Why are you spending time concentrating on fighting every single dev who ever worked on Bitcoin other than Mike rather than finding common ground with them and helping achieve common goals?
As far as I can tell the reverse is not true, Bitcoin devs have been bending over backwards to engage with scaling solutions and even radical and near term changes. As you mention, Bitcoin devs are even working towards a future where lite clients can be safely used, instead of with the crutch of miners hopefully validating other miners
I understand if you aren't going to push for coding and can respect if you can take a step back and let more specialized and motivated minds attack those problems. But participating in a campaign of slander against them is helping? When did we lose the guy who was pushing for a better payments protocol? When did we trade him for the empty suit who helps validate sham organizations like the Bitcoin Foundation?

Increasing the cost to run nodes without increasing the benefit to run nodes will probably lead to fewer nodes and thus more centralization

It's hard to say, the pace of improvement of mining equipment is very high and the mining equipment companies are using their newest equipment themselves instead of selling it
I think the most cost effective way to help the network is to buy Bitcoins. The value of Bitcoins is the primary motivator for the hash power that secures it, Bitcoin's value is due to the limited supply, reducing the supply further should increase the value, all things being equal.
The way things are going at the moment, if you buy a miner it will almost certainly not even pay for itself in electricity cost.

Bitcoin is a political project, so if you really "buy into" it, it should be for political reasons.
1. If you use your credit card at a store, like Target, you are running the risk of them getting hacked and someone else using your credit card.
2. If you use your credit card at any business you are trusting them to charge you the correct amount and not re-charge you later (like when you "accidentally" sign up for a subscription)
3. When you leave money in your bank account in fiat, you can easily lose money to inflation.
4. When you use a credit card or debit card at a store you like or to donate to a cause you believe in, you are making the merchant or charity pay an extra 2 or 3% on the total bill. (Many stores don't let you pay with CC unless it's over a certain amount.)
5. When you travel to any other country, your credit card will often by default will charge you usurious fees to convert to the foreign currency.
6. When you pay with credit card or debit card, you are supporting a certain richest of the rich class by letting them be gatekeepers of all transactions, you are voting with your dollars that these people deserve to charge a percentage on all transactions just because. The dollars saved if you bypass those people and spend your money at small businesses will most likely go to support the middle class, creating a healthier economy. 
7. Governments often abuse their power to print money by borrowing a lot of money because they know if they get into serious trouble they can always inflate away their debts. The US for example spends $1 trillion every 4 years just on interest payments. Even if you're not a libertarian you could imagine how $1 trillion could be put to a lot of good use.
8. If you use your credit card or bank card and forget or don't pay the full balance or overdraft your account or go below minimum balance: the bank or credit card company will charge you high fees for your mistake (these are a major profit center for them).
9. Credit cards have statements that go to your home and are permanently saved. If you want to buy a gift for your wife without her knowing, you might need an alternate way to pay for something
10. Banks have their own political agendas and can be pressured by the government. If you want to spend money on something that is against those agendas, like cloud storage space on Mega or a donation to wikileaks, You can't do it through your credit card.
11. If you just want to pay money to your friend, try doing it with a credit card. Not possible.
12. Credit cards reveal your personal information to merchants. Even though it's not always obvious it's happening: your name and address information is often being leaked to the merchant, so they can spam you or sell your data
13. Sometimes you'll try to pay with credit card but it will be rejected for some reason or another even though you've done nothing wrong. You'll have to "try another card". This problem will never occur with bitcoin as long as you can broadcast a valid transaction to the network.
14. Credit cards can't be used for a wide variety of transactions. For example if you want to play online poker with your friends for $1 stakes, that's not possible with credit cards. 
15. Credit cards have very limited ability to have joint payment decisions. Let's say you want an account where you and your wife have to agree before spending a large amount, that's possible with an easy to use Bitcoin app for iPhone but not with credit cards.
Credit cards have their uses, Bitcoin is not a full replacement for them, nor was it designed to be. There is some overlap, but if you want to use Bitcoin you should probably consider it as a currency and a political project first and as a payment system second.

The miners are already pretty centralized, there's not all that many pool operators.
The negatives of bigger blocks have to do with regular people running nodes, and or sabotaging the creation of a fee market. If a block is full, higher fees get priority: the network will never get slower past a certain point, it will get more expensive to use. 
Currently we already pay miners a very high fee for usage, it's called the block reward - this cheapens everyone's coins. The block reward is going away over the next 20-100 years so we'll have to replace it with fees. Currently fees are not near all time highs and are pretty far from them, but that could change
If you made a movie, you could give it to everyone for a very low price. But that might not maximize revenue: you want to create a market for your movie. You don't want it too high and you don't want it too low. A large block size carries the risk of too low a market price for a transaction fee, which leads to less security and higher costs for individual people and businesses to run their own node
If you're using spv or some lite client and you think this doesn't apply to you, well think about where your spv or lite client is getting its data. You're getting a free ride and if the price of that ride increases to the people providing it, they could pass the cost on to you

Well I've been targeted because my point of view is unpopular with some, that's for sure
No doubt that a lower blocksize leads to rising fees and a change in the economics
Saying that Bitcoin can't hard fork or that blocksize must remain fixed is a strawman argument
If you ask the mining pool operators, they are convinced by the evidence that there must be a block limit. (they are the ones that the block increase limits have been programmed to ask)
One issue is that nodes can't actually process an infinitely large block, so you could end up splitting the network by making a block big enough that some nodes can't process it but others can

Even if they accept this proposition and the network changes, how can we know if it is real? A Chinese miner can easily push their hashes to a pool outside of China and then switch back as they wish

Well miners being data centers is not ideal. It weakens the network and slows down processing to have concentrations of miners in data centers because instead of assuming that 51% of many people are not evil you have to assume that 51% of a few people are not evil.
Bitcoin has enough other safeguards that this situation is not the end of the world, but it's definitely not good
Nodes being in big data centers is similar, it's not the end but it's not great. It's similar to how people do email through big data centers: seems fine right? Until you think about how the government is doing warrant less spying on gmail and other data center emails and threatening other email providers like lavabit with jail if they don't comply. And email is even designed in a way that you can run it from your home
Ideally to get the best of both worlds like satoshi thought might be possible, data centers would assist lite clients but lite clients would not have to trust them completely. We have had some progress towards this: lite clients connect to many nodes to re-verify data, lite clients check the block height, etc, but it is not secure enough yet, there are still attacks that can be carried off against lite clients which make depending 100% on them a bad idea

I think the answer is muddy, a market with infinite capacity should charge nothing: you don't get charged for air. That's why people think the fee market can't work. 
Miners can cooperate to set minimum fees, however commodity cartels are easily broken.
The full nodes can try to enforce a block size policy that targets a preferred miner revenue, but that would be hard to coordinate
I think it's too early to freak out about infinite supply because there is a good chance there will always be a small fee just by social convention and because the miners won't ever truly have infinite supply
I can understand why it's appealing to want to solve this problem now, this is one of the scariest questions and if it's not solved it could break everything, there aren't a lot of problems like that in Bitcoin's concept

First: they don't agree on a change, so there's that.
I also doubt your 25% number, I'd guess more like 10% aren't running a core consensus node, and not all those 10% nodes have the same consensus algorithm.
Second, if I'm a miner and I have 10% of the hashing power, maybe I decide to bet that Bitcoin will split into two long running coins. Then I'll have like 100% of the hashing power for a while and clean up on block rewards. It's risky, but maybe it will pay off. Personally, I would definitely buy some core dev coins over some mike hearn coins.
Another problem is that people can simply be ignorant of the change, not everyone is watching bitcoin news all the time. We've had 0.11 for a good long time now, a major percentage of the network are running 0.10.

If Bitcoin splits into two separate and long running chains, your cold wallets will have balances on both chains. Coin A and Coin B will have separate values, there will be two prices.
Now if you are able to predict what chain will be more valuable, you can quickly act in the beginning of the hard fork, and trade your Coin As for more Coin Bs. Of course if you're wrong, you'll lose out, you could even lose all your coins value that way.
Another thing to watch out for is that when there are two forks, don't send anyone any bitcoins right away. The problem will be that it will be very easy to inadvertently send both Coin As and Coin Bs. You should wait for a while for markets to open up that will allow you to "taint" your coins, and then keep your Coin A and Coin B coins separate, and spend them separately. Merchants will have to update their software to show which Coin they expect to receive, A or B.

There are four answers:
1. The Blocksize increases and the fee market has so much supply it stays low
2. The Lightning network allows you to pay for coffee using bitcoin and it lets many people share the cost of a single fee
3. Instead of Bitcoin you pay with a sidechain coin that has less traffic and can eventually settle with Bitcoin, but be pegged to its valuation.

Please name the mining pools that have turned soft limits off, I've lost the link that shows it
Previous fees were decided by the developers by decree, they were adjusted from version to version to match the price but sometimes the price changed too quickly to adapt
The problem of how to lower fees is one of external cost. I have limited bandwidth at my home. If my Bitcoin node stays within reasonable limits I can run it all the time no problem. If it takes tons of bandwidth then I can't run it. That means that it's not free to have more tx, there is a cost I must bear. That means we should model that cost somehow
I don't agree with removing the block increase as a "plan for success". I just don't think there is evidence it is urgent or necessarily the best solution to implement now, and I very much disagree with separating the network into two versions of Bitcoin which is a potential consequence.

Changing the max block size wouldn't change miners who choose to keep their limits lower than they have to though.

If a miner mines a block that breaks the rules of the other nodes, first full nodes will ignore it and not count any transactions in the block as having a confirmation. Second miners will not build the next block on that bad block. Third, if the bad block builder continues to build on his bad block or other miners do build on it, the other nodes will disregard even good blocks that build on the bad block. In the worst case scenario where miners always keep mining bad blocks the hashing difficulty will start to become easier to reflect their non presence in the chain.

OP is presenting a strawman where it paints opponents of zero conf as inflexible and saying that zero conf should never be used when what they are really saying is that it should never be treated as bulletproof because it can't be made bulletproof. So similar to the block size debate yes by painting opponents as inflexible perfectionists rather than people who are focused on risk stability. Just because Bitcoin is a risky investment doesn't mean we need to compound that risk by making the entire platform more risky, if anything it needs to be made less risky: we can't just sit on our hands and wait for destiny to make it not risky.
For transactions, let's say the network evicts transactions randomly when the mempool is full. Now I send a million bogus transactions to the network, overloading the mempools and evicting the valid transactions. This gives me a cancel button on my transactions, so what I do is submit my transaction to the merchant and the millisecond they accept it I press my cancel button and flood the network with my decoy transactions

@_date: 2015-12-19 08:18:17
It's the fees. What I think is the issue is that the way it calculated fees was incorrect. When you send Bitcoin somewhere, you most often send too much and the rest is sent back to you. In this case the amount sent back to you is so small that it should have been rounded over into your fee. CoPay didn't do this properly and it didn't round, so it decided to send the tiny rounding error back to you. The network doesn't like to see rounding errors because they are easy to spam and waste everyone's time with, so it doesn't process your transaction.

You sending hash power is a separate issue because of how blocks are published.
China has very very good internal connectivity, and very very bad external connectivity.
If there is a race situation where you want the next miner to build on your block and one block is being published in the UK and the other is being published in China, it's likely that the Chinese miners will pick up the one published in China and the European miners will pick up the one published in Europe.
Overall this is a rare situation, but since mining is competitive and designed to push profit margins as low as possible, even small advantages like 1% can make a big difference. That's why many miners are publishing zero transaction blocks, it gives them a small advantage.

I also think $0.5 is almost impossible in the next six months, I'll be surprised if we even break $0.15. And you'd want to give people some time to upgrade when hard forking, you wouldn't want to just say: you have a week, update or your client breaks.

If Bitcoin splits there will be a way to trade between them by trading tainted coins that are only valid on one side.
Each person who already has coins will receive equal number of coins on each side of the split and then he can trade from there to adjust his balance.
Since each coin will have a different value, you'll potentially be able to trade the coin type you don't want for the coin type you do want, and ultimately receive more of the coin type you wanted. So if you start with 100 BTC you might be able to get 150 BTC out of the split, depending on how contentious it is

The possibility still exists that there would be contention, even with miner support. Miners have an incentive to be on the most lucrative fork, that's not necessarily the most hash power one. 
The 1mb limit was soft forked in, not hard forked, I take your point about rules changing before but so far they've been backwards compatible 
The point isn't that there would be bitcoinA and bitcoinB, it's that there is that possibility and that would be a bad situation

That's exactly the reason to argue about centralization, to prevent the power of the miners which is already a lot from increasing even more.
If we have to capitulate to the reality that our best possible effort will result in an oligopoly of miners, we need to make sure that what they can do with that power is as limited as possible, and that the oligopoly has as many members as possible and keep looking for ways to break or weaken it
The good news is that miners know that they present a problem to the system, but that their power is paradoxically only useful if they don't present a problem. So normally they try and avoid being a problem, but it's certainly possible they could be.

Mining pools create blocks that are verified by the rest of the network. If any member of the network doesn't view a block as valid, he can ignore the block and wait for a valid block and use that as the true transaction history. So no matter what mining pools produce, it's up to the individuals to accept it.

You could say the same thing about any Altcoin, why are they offtopic? Is Bitcoin perfect or are there any areas that can be improved? Maybe we need 42 million coins instead of 21 million. Maybe we need 2.5 minute blocks instead of 10 minute blocks. What would be the best way to discuss those improvements? Not by spamming everyone to use this or that altcoin.
The right way to get improvements in Bitcoin is to actually make improvements to Bitcoin, hardfork or not.

Odd, I didn't see Paxful pledge any money to pay some developers to actually implement anything.

Bitcoin is not at war with altcoins. If they flourish and provide more opportunities for people, that is not a red alert either.
The core devs don't control "waiting minutes for a confirmation". That was setup by Satoshi. That's always been a part of the system.

Yeah I don't think transaction throughput is much of an issue at the moment. Sybil attacks are pretty theoretical too, but maybe eventually if node counts dwindle too precipitously someone could cause some annoyances
Network reliability might be the issue to target, in that case you might want to distribute your nodes in multiple locations. It's not likely tons of nodes would fail all over the world to such a degree there would be any disruption, but even if that were possible, many nodes in the same place probably wouldn't help much

A wallet still needs to generate the signed transaction like it happens now. You will likely have lightning funds and Bitcoin funds, kind of like checking and savings. When you spend you still send to a Bitcoin address, however you tell your lightning server instead of the Bitcoin network. The Lightning server broadcasts your transaction on lightning, the coins are sent instantly without any confirmation waiting and your lightning funds also go down instantly, no confirmations.
@_date: 2015-06-04 04:03:16
You have to lock funds on lightning first, basically give them to a hub
This can be done in a low risk way where you can get your coins back after a lockout time, but that could be annoying for a large amount

We may already have a centralized block chain in the sense that there are only a small set of miners. There may already be a 51% party and we have no way of knowing it
No one has come up with any way to stop mining from being centralized, except some stupid ways like making a big fuss on reddit when the mining pool appears to be approaching 50% (mining pools don't have to publish their percentage and it's trivial for them to make it appear lower than it is - miners self report their identity on blocks optionally)
Mining is a market driven system so in theory there should be multiple entrants especially as the advantages for a large pool vs a small pool basically come down to smoother variance and nothing more. Markets aren't perfectly efficient though, we're still talking about a people driven system not a math driven one, so it's hard to predict what will happen or make anything that will conclusively prevent it from happening. 
The good news is that decentralization is a sliding scale and even with a 51% mining party it doesn't mean the end of Bitcoin because what they can do with that 51% power is fairly limited and what they would probably want to do with that power is limited even more. 
The 51% party could mess with the flow of transactions and they could make the confirmation process more suspect but they can't take bitcoins from people and they are strongly incentivized by the block reward to keep everything running normally and not mess with the system

Bitcoin is a decentralized system, people have to look at the facts and decide things for themselves

I don't get how a goal for Bitcoin to be decentralized and trustless is not aligned with the goal of universality. By universal I mean everyone can use it, which is almost just another way of saying "decentralized", but going further and saying not only *can* everyone use it, but everyone *does* use it
Bitcoin is designed to have a virtuous circle where the more value that is placed on it, the more decentralized it can become, because the valuation and the hashing power become harder to dominate.
I think I'm confused when you say that increasing the blocksize at all is a bad idea, is it bad because you think it's not the best possible way to improve throughput or it's bad because you think the blockchain should only ever contain a fixed linearly increasing and small number of transactions?

I think it could be possible that your existing wallet would suddenly have Lightning capabilities (after the wallet was updated of course). There would be a button on there that would say: "Enable Lightning" and it would ask how much of your funds to move to Lightning. The wallet would decide how to lock up the funds, for example Mycelium might lock them up with their own server, Electrum might lock them up with participating Electrum Servers and Breadwallet would lock them up with random servers. Since you can get your funds back if there is a problem with the locked up server, the worst that happens is that you have some funds locked and they are stuck there for a while.
Of course like you say that could be very tricky and the wallet devs might not be into it, so Lightning would just be something in Bitcoin-QT only. I definitely think it is not a sure thing because of its complexity and the need for wallets to integrate it, plus merchants have to adopt it too...

I'm happy to help inform you that when Satoshi set the size limit for blocks it was a backwards compatible change that did not create an altcoin.
Bitcoin should remain decentralized. Giving over trust to 3-4 mining pools to "please do the right thing" is not what decentralized means. If someone tries to change Bitcoin to be centralized, it's not hard to see that they are creating an alt-coin.

The reason is that more than one person might find a valid block in a short space of time. They both think their block is valid, and both blocks are valid. Then they have to race each other to send out their block to everyone and one will lose and the other will win.
This can be confusing - your transaction could go from 1 confirmation to 0 confirmations, so 10 minutes are given as a variance so it doesn't happen as often, it makes it a lot more unlikely that at the same exact few seconds multiple valid blocks will be found.

Bitcoin is a tool, so the question is how could Greece use it to help their situation. Also Greece could refer to Greek individuals or the Greek government. 
For individuals Bitcoin could help them break financial laws of Greece if their government took very drastic action and started seizing funds or stopping currency movement or levying high import/export taxes. Even before that happens, people can use Bitcoin as a hedge against that happening. 
For the government I'm not sure how it could help, maybe if they formed a new currency they could say it was partially backed by Bitcoin: like they would give you 5% of a drachma value in Bitcoin. That could help marginally put some faith that drachmas wouldn't become totally worthless without exposing them too much to Bitcoin volatility

I think the basic idea is to optimize the syncing of miner's prospective blocks so that we don't have the problem of these zero transaction blocks. Currently a miner has to make a block and then publish it, but if all miners were publishing their potential blocks all the time then it would go much faster once they pulled the trigger and there would be less risk of publishing a block full of tx instead of a zero tx block. Since all the nodes already know about tx anyway hashes can be used as a shortcut

In some ways things having problems argues for smaller blocks. If error modes are more frequent, handling them becomes more important: the attack surface of Bitcoin grows smaller.

If this situation starts to occur, it may change the tune of the core devs and other doubters of big blocks. If the problem is more obvious and pressing, it will be easier to get consensus.
The real danger is a timing issue, what if usage goes ballistic overnight and doesn't have a slow build, then we have a problem
Tx stuck in mempool is already an annoying issue for some people, there might be a way around that:
1. Have wallets set dynamic defaults to avoid small fees that will never confirm
2. Have miners let people increase tx fees if they haven't confirmed in a long time
3. Encourage miners to have large mempools by improving mempool code
Another thing I could see happening for better or for worse: more people going to circle and coinbase. Those offchain wallets are going to get more attractive with zero fees in-network, and they could even offer lower fees outside of network by bundling transactions between networks

If an accidental hard-fork is released, it should be abandoned as an accidental altcoin.
Popularity of things doesn't always map to development activity on them. BitcoinXT for one certainly has a severe lack of developers, no commits for a month, not even to copy ongoing improvements from Bitcoin Core.
So you say: if Richie Rich bribed a majority of people to use an inflationary Bitcoin then you consider that Bitcoin.
For me, the number of people who use Bitcoin is not relevant to its definition, and I find it presumptuous that you would tell me that the number of people who use a certain fork of Bitcoin defines what is the real Bitcoin. By that logic if China made all their citizens use a new type of fiat and called it Bitcoin, now they turned Bitcoin into fiat. To me that's a farcical definition

It's not the healthiest of price drivers because there is a danger of a self defeating prophesy: people don't use it because they are waiting for the day that everyone uses it.

Generally they are compatible but there are edge cases between them. The issue with HD wallets is that they pick a generator seed that yields tons of addresses, but when recovering they can't check all of these addresses so they use a iterator function to check 10, then check the next 10 etc. So the HD standard specifies that common BIP wallets will get common addresses yes, but they won't use the same algorithms to check which addresses have activity. Because of different behavior for change addresses and that kind of thing, it's possible for edge case funds to be overlooked in recovery from one wallet to another. In that case you haven't really lost funds, it's just going to be annoying to recover them.

I don't disagree that it will likely have a slowing effect, but I think you numbers are too high.
At $5, instead of a block fees being worth 1% of the block reward as they are today, they'd be worth like 200% of the block reward. I'm not saying this to argue for higher fees because I agree there are downsides, but having an answer to the question "is it even feasible for Bitcoin to be fee supported" would be a bonus.
Why do you see this as a decision that must happen today? Do you see fees jumping to $0.50 within the next year? Within the next six months? If that doesn't come to pass, would that make you think differently?

How do you know the block size increasing means that more people are using it? Maybe one guy is using it a lot? However you said that a 10GB block couldn't even be handled by a normal node
It sounds like you think that nodes are maintaining the blockchain somehow, could you explain what you think there?
Also it sounds like you think that there need to be "enough" nodes. Can you explain what enough means and how many is that?
BitTorrent is an interesting example, because in my experience torrents don't work at arbitrary sizes. If you have a neat file at 100kb, maybe lots of people will seed it. If you have a neat file at 100tb, you won't find too many seeders.

I think 20mb is a bit extreme, especially as a cliff function. As a dev if a manager came to me and said hey we're going to dump 20x more load on your server tomorrow I'd really want to know why we couldn't ramp up more slowly if possible. Things behave differently at different orders of magnitude. 
Making this discussion into an argument threatens to make things polarized, with each side backing their version for dogmatic rather than practical reasons.

@_date: 2015-12-28 10:38:42
OK you should have explained that, there are many ways for an unintentional fork to occur and I was thinking of other scenarios
In the cases you mention:


Blocks should stop, a new fork should be created that solves the split. Choose to continue a chain based on best judgement or random, eventual new joined longest chain is Bitcoin. The remainders are altcoins.


Blocks should stop, fix the regression bug, fixed bug chain is now Bitcoin, the rest are altcoins


It depends on the feature. I don't count out hardforks, just ones that aren't Bitcoin. I think you're trying to paint me into a corner where I say that all hard forks are bad, but I am not saying that
So yes I believe if Bitcoin changes for the better because of a hard fork, I'm on board. However if it changes for the worse, I'm not on board. Even if a ton of people are on board, I'm not jumping off the cliff with them.

Just a week ago a number of developers put forward a plan to address scaling in multiple ways.  - that sounds like a compromise to me, people want cheaper transactions, they are working on cheaper transactions (right now transactions cost $0.04 by the way, not an especially high amount)
Their proposed plan includes a potential block size change. 
Gavin lowered his initial increase, but only with respect to what the Chinese miners requested, not with respect to what any of the active developers thought was prudent. No active developer of Bitcoin signed off on his plan as being a good one.

One of the disputes here is the assumption that every transaction belongs on the blockchain 
Obviously the blockchain transactions must contain some level of transactions more than 0. And everyone realizes that the level of transactions must be less than infinity. 
The issue is where is the line drawn between those two extremes? The downside for few transactions is that it potentially hurts adoption and limits the usefulness of the network. The downside for infinite transactions is that hardware can't physically handle that, and more transactions means more expensive hardware and maintenance.
It's a very popular opinion amongst the devs working on the Bitcoin consensus code that Bitcoin should not process coffee or other small transactions directly on the blockchain. However among the community of Bitcoin users using Bitcoin directly is a great feature so they want to use it everywhere possible.
No side says that Bitcoin can't scale. They just disagree on the effects of scaling and the best approach to scaling. Bitcoin core devs say Lightning is the way forward for scaling. The downside for this is a fee squeeze until lightning arrives (potentially, fees are still way lower than they have ever been). Mike Hearn says the way forward is corporate control of nodes with infinite transaction limits and contracts with miners to reward them when the block reward runs out. Gavin says the way forward is not clear and we should avoid a fee squeeze at the moment.

I think the main problem is that people don't agree exactly how much bigger and exactly how much to grow dynamically
A 20mb block size potentially means 3gb/day increase in the blockchain size over the current 150mb/day increase. 8mb would be 1gb/day. 
Those are extreme scenarios but it could happen, especially if miners find some advantage over other miners by inflating the block size which is a possibility since the Chinese miners have said they can't handle 20mb block bandwidth

I think full nodes are more of a backup plan: what happens if running light wallets becomes problematic? Even if people don't run them, the idea is that they could, they are like the bomb shelter if the network comes under attack, or the rock that everything else is built upon.
Some problems with light wallets:
1. Light wallets are still powered by full nodes. Someone somewhere has to pay that price of running a full node. Increasing the price of running a full node or increasing the ratio of light clients to full clients, these things could shift the balance so that light clients found it harder to find a full node to connect to because there is not a lot of incentive to run an open full node for light clients to connect to.
2. Light wallets aren't as tightly secured as the full nodes are. Let's say someone starts hammering the network with a new attack that light clients are vulnerable to. (Double spending comes to mind since light clients don't verify the transaction chain). The ultimate solution would be to go to a full node until a countermeasure could be found.
The mining issue I agree with you is a non issue. The only problem there is that we have a lot of mining power tied up in China and they could interfere with a seamless transition to 20mb. The way Gavin is structuring it, the majority of miners must be on board before 20mb turns on. Chinese miners control enough power to veto a 20mb block. The reason Gavin is giving the veto to the Chinese is if we don't, the transition to 20mb won't be as seamless: it can still happen, but it will be bumpy as coins could be lost in the period where there is no consensus.

OK: if the transaction was opted out it is a standard transaction, all transactions opt out by default
Standard transactions may still be replaced, yes. That's even an essential behavior of the network since sometimes funds can get stuck when no miner wants to include a transaction in a block.
It's only common practice that miners don't allow replacing transactions, they do that to improve the usability of Bitcoin and because it's the default behavior. They are free to replace transactions as they wish for any reason

I think you and many other voices like yours are coming at this with incorrect assumptions. You didn't "buy Bitcoin" from the core developers. They don't represent you or work for you and they owe you precisely nothing.
1. Claiming urgency about a situation that would only become urgent at some future unknown point in time is false urgency. Where was the urgency when the block limit was introduced? What makes this particular point in time urgent when you can't point to when it would become urgent just "we need it long before".
2. You claim not to blame the developers, but then you title your points "The Core Developers don't seem to be willing to compromise much". "The Core developers aren't very good at communicating with their detractors.". "It feels like the core developers are abandoning some of the potential that Bitcoin has to offer." I don't know what it sounds like when you are praising people
3. Many of their detractors are not interested in facts. They have fixated on a single solution and have bought into a conspiracy theory of why the core devs feel the way they do, how can you communicate with someone who is shouting you are a secret Muslim?
4. Compromises generally are not unilaterally declared. You don't compromise by saying, ok you want $10 for this and I want to pay $2, so I am paying $5 and bye bye. To bring in Godwin, you don't compromise with Hitler by saying, "Ok let's just kill half the jews".
5. Core devs are individuals, they are not a unit. Each one of them has their own interests in the technology and where they want it to go. They are not asking for your investment. They didn't present a plan to you saying, "here's what we are gonna do, buy some bitcoin so we can do it." That's because they aren't scamming you like when you "invest" in your altcoins

Thanks for the direct reply, from the back and forth it sounds like the problem is that from his black box testing perspective he was seeing funds at risk and from your white box testing perspective you could see they were not at risk. On one side or the other there was less than perfect communication which was compounded by the unrelated account ban.
I've had bugs on my Coinbase account before, it's hard to tell what is going on from the user side because the bug on the account doesn't result in a discrete user facing error.

Better to have simplicity and standardization rather than many complex and poorly vetted projects.
The same thing can really apply to open source encryption itself, the NSA and others would love to have some backdoors. You don't make a million new encryption projects to fight that, you make sure the existing projects are open source, simple and given tons of scrutiny

It doesn't hurt, so you are helping marginally. If you think the network needs more nodes for bandwidth or something then you have been misled.

Block size limit requires a hard fork. In the past hard forks have been achieved very quickly once there is broad consensus (think weeks not months)
There are downsides to simple increases in block size limits, it puts more pressure on App devs and increases the cost of running a full node. Fees are currently at record lows and blocks are not consistently full, so there isn't a lot of pressure on devs yet to change their minds

Multisig is the way to go but your site doesn't offer a lot of explanation of what you're making
The killer web wallet is going to be purely multisig in a way where the web wallet isn't even a wallet: it's a signature creator.
You have to have a trust model where your web wallet can die, your web wallet can be compromised, the user can be fooled into loading a fake version of your site, and still all coins are 100% safe. 
Here's the model I want:
1. Setup my trust system: To make transactions, I'll require at least 3 points of trust. Trustedcoin gets 1 point. Your web wallet gets 1 point. My trezor gets 2 points, my desktop electrum gets 2 points, my backup key that's only ever on paper has 3 points and I can load it into offline electrum manually and bypass all points together
2. Transaction info is echoed across all points. If I make a payment I see your version of tx info and look independently at electrum or trezor to see the same information there. This includes the new DNS identity stuff so if it's a corporate identity cert I also see that echoed and independently checked on all devices
3. Your web wallet then helps orchestrate the process but does not control it. You can get hacked, but your hack doesn't compromise my other clients so that limits my exposure.

I like the proposed solution but I think the problem as stated is one of those "assume a perfect sphere" issues. 
The market for mining will never be perfectly smooth, I think it's fair to say that the halving in the future can produce bumpy effects, but not that it would completely shut down all hash power.
For example there are miners who have access to essentially free energy. Those kind of opportunities are limited and can't be expected to be extended across the entire mining network. A "free energy" miner might never have an incentive to turn off his rig.

One of the ideas behind Bitcoin is that it's about 100% voluntary involvement, so just present your offer to them and let them make up their own mind if they want it.

I don't think you understand how markets work, important transactions will get higher fees and will go faster and trivial transactions will get lower fees and take longer
If fees go too high you're right people will use other solutions, but that will also put a limit on how high fees will get
Fees also aren't the only variable miners use. Miners want the network to be healthy overall (their rewards are in btc) so they use tactics to reduce spam tx even if they are relatively high fee.

You're really proposing making Bitcoin nodes dialup friendly or are you just pointing out a technicality?
I'm confused by what your saying about going against your interests. You want the small blocks to further your private interest of having poor connectivity personally. But you don't want to further your interest of having your held coins be more valuable on the market. It almost sounds like you want decentralization for the sake of itself and not to further the end user goal of a worldwide currency

I'm not sure what "investors" want when it comes to block size, both options could potentially lead to a high market price for Bitcoin. My feeling is that smaller blocks means a lower risk that Bitcoins will go to zero, but a bigger risk that Bitcoins will never reach extremely high market prices.

Sure but you need to get all the miners on board to equal the Bitcoin network security, plus their incentives are still oriented towards the Bitcoin camp mostly since their reward is Bitcoins.
Also just to point out the obvious: side-chains aren't ready yet.
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:15:58
So you want to make running a node either something you must pay a high price for, either voluntarily or as a professional expense I guess? What bounds that high price, what's the max I would need to pay to host my node?
As I see it there is a function where x = the number of transactions, k is the cost per transaction I must bear, and y is the total cost to my node. k * x = y. What is the max y?
There's a major problem with everyone using SPV at the moment and that's what happens if the miners create an accidental hard fork? In that case any SPV client will break. This has happened pretty recently and went up to 6 blocks. Every SPV client broke, every full node was fine. I like using SPV clients, but I also like having a backup of a full node just in case there is a problem.
As far as privacy goes, I see no solution that doesn't involve a full node, meaning there may be no free way to use Bitcoin with the privacy not revealing all your addresses via SPV?
I think there are some valid points about how the protocol is poorly defined so we can't have alternative clients without the risk of accidental hard fork, and that sucks because it creates a natural monoculture around one client (happens to be bitcoin core right now). And maybe the core devs aren't really doing anything to change that particular status quo. But there are no other devs working on a compelling alternative client. Weeks can go by without a commit on XT. A buffer overflow vulnerability was checked into master in XT without anyone noticing. Gavin has said he wants to pull back from coding. Mike took another job. Who will be the coders of an alternative future?

Miners don't earn any USD per transaction. They earn BTC per block. There is no direct relation between block reward earned and number of transactions in the block

- they think it won't force a solution for all time. Gavin has an idea that if we drive towards a block size cliff, developers will have a good motivation to develop wings (that's why he wants an untested block size change, he calls this strategy newspeak "plan for success")

The transaction fees are a market where you can pay what you want and miners can choose to take your fee or not.
Miners can only take up to a certain number of transactions, up to the block limit. They can choose to take fewer if they have a reason to take fewer.
A bigger block could mean higher total fees for the miner, because they can take more transactions. Of course it could also mean equal or lower total fees for the miner too, because if demand remains the same and supply increases: prices should go down.
It's impossible to predict a market exactly. Diamonds aren't all that rare, but through marketing and coordinated effort their prices equal that of rare stones. Theres no predicting what will happen with fees in a future with bigger blocks or the same blocks

Isn't relying on miners to fight spam because they want to protect regular transactions ignoring the tragedy of the commons issue where miners will just hope other people do that work and they just take the biggest fees no matter what?

There's some counterparty risk to storing hashes, timestamping is not replicable cryptographically without the Blockchain. You can't trust a signed timestamp to have a relation to the actual time, it's just a signed piece of data that says a time, but it could really have been any time.
I don't see a strong need for a counterparty risk free way to trade securities, or if it's even possible considering securities are really contracts that must be enforced by a counter party: the government.
I do see a need for a more standardized, fair and efficient way to trade securities globally and digitally, but I don't see how the Blockchain is needed to create those standards other than as a timestamp mechanism

1. The energy consumed by the network is nothing compared to the amount of energy needed to make fiat currency work because the network is purely digital vs fiat real life moving parts. Also not all "energy" is created equal. Bitcoin miners are financially incentivized to find the cheapest possible energy - meaning the easiest to produce, least in demand types of energy. Waste energy is perfect for Bitcoin
2. No market is perfectly efficient. Currently the miners are having to offset large equipment costs. In the future mining could serve other purposes that we don't know now.
3. Eventually mining rewards will go to a fee market. Again we're still figuring this out but the current plan is for fee amounts to flatten out and be pushed to a minimum
4. Even though it's pretty obvious Bitcoin is more energy efficient than driving armored trucks around the country, hiring armed guards, building bank branches, flying around bank executives, air conditioning in said bank branches, trucks and people to service ATMs, ATMs being on 24 hours, security lights for ATMs, even Bitcoin were not more efficient than fiat, it wouldn't matter because saying "it uses more energy" is not a valid argument against anything. If you don't believe that turn off your computer now and save some precious energy...
5. Cost and value are just another way of stating what people's subjective desires are. There's no such thing as objective value
6. There's no way we know of to make a miner secure the network in a way that also has some other positive side effect. You have some boner for energy like it's running out. Energy is a renewable resource. It's not some life force that we are draining out of the world.
Your concerns all sound like they boil down to the idea that the Bitcoin network is using too much energy. Even if energy cost is high, there's no other way to provide this service. There's no other way to provide a currency that a person can own that is protected in the same way from the government's interference.
If you're fortunate enough to live in a society where your government is not abusing their power over fiat currency, congratulations for you: but you might not always be so lucky. You might join the billions of others in the world living in oppressive or corrupt regimes who can't rely on their government to manage their brand of fiat. Bitcoin is expressly designed for this purpose, to give the power to the individual.
Another thing to think about: 10% of US GDP is going to the financial sector, every single year. It's similar to what the US spends on the military industrial complex. I'm sure both of these are doing some important jobs, but without action to challenge them, how will they be reformed? They won't. How much waste then?

It would be funny if people sold their Bitcoins because of too much development or some optional updates that they don't even have to install
1. There's no urgency because there's no evidence of an emergency situation. An "emergency". It was called "urgent" in June. It is called "urgent" now. How long can it be urgent yet have no ill effects?
2. The core devs put forth their own plans. They are hard at work every day working on their plans for how to solve these future problems. They made it their life work to solve these problems. You plop down $414 and then yell at developers like you did more than them
3. Core devs do all their communicating in the open, in mailing lists and on github and on IRC. If you want to talk to them, it's almost too easy. They respond on reddit. They don't have a singular point of view, each of them have nuanced viewpoints, and they never presume that they control Bitcoin, they almost actively try to prevent controlling Bitcoin out of paranoia of being too important
4. The core devs don't have a single mouthpiece. These guys are just guys who showed up to work on Bitcoin, anyone can do it. They didn't "frame the argument", they voiced some potential downsides to a plan. Even BIP 101 doesn't immediately un-limit the block size, so there must be some downside to having an unbounded limit even on the "pro" side. 
5. The blockchain was claimed as being all things to all people as part of general hype. In the cold light of day it's better that it does a limited job very well and serve as a foundation for other things on top of it, rather than trying to be an all-in-one experience that serves every need. In the final analysis, that is where the most potential lies

Electrum is very good if you are sending funds. They have multisig options so that you can use Google auth or another computer to sign off on transactions, making it so that even if one computer is compromised the funds cannot be spent 
For receiving funds I find it hard to beat Bitcoin Core because of how comprehensively it checks the incoming transaction, all light clients skip the verification checks

Lightning is a single network
@_date: 2015-06-01 10:07:50
I don't get how a goal for Bitcoin to be decentralized and trustless is not aligned with the goal of universality. By universal I mean everyone can use it, which is almost just another way of saying "decentralized", but going further and saying not only *can* everyone use it, but everyone *does* use it
Bitcoin is designed to have a virtuous circle where the more value that is placed on it, the more decentralized it can become, because the valuation and the hashing power become harder to dominate.
I think I'm confused when you say that increasing the blocksize at all is a bad idea, is it bad because you think it's not the best possible way to improve throughput or it's bad because you think the blockchain should only ever contain a fixed linearly increasing and small number of transactions?
@_date: 2015-06-28 06:29:14
They'll use Bitcoin as a unit of account but not the transaction network. What Greece is doing now is using Euros as a unit of account, which is inconvenient for their government because they don't control that unit of account so they can't just inflate it at will
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:42:55
Increasing the size limit would have the good effects of allowing for faster/cheaper transactions, but the negative effects of making it more expensive and slower to start running a full bitcoin client that downloads the entire blockchain.
The point is that we need faster / cheaper transactions because usage is growing and we don't want there to be disincentives to usage
@_date: 2015-06-20 13:58:24
Lightning is a formalization and standardized coding of a couple of big concepts in Bitcoin that would let users have instant 100% secure transactions (no waiting for confirmations) and would be able to scale transaction traffic to any reasonable level of transactions.
The concepts are:
1. Payment channels. They aren't widely used, but you can already see these in use in things like streamium:  Their advantage to payment channels is that they let you make "micro" payments in Bitcoin so that you don't have to pay transaction fees or worry about the confirmation times, you just settle up once.
2. Offchain transactions, bitcoin settlements. This is very widely used, from changetip to the bitcoin exchanges, coinbase, etc. In an offchain system, a central hub maintains the balances for users and then only goes to bitcoin when they leave the hub.
So Lightning is a peer to peer network of servers, like super bitcoin nodes, you connect to these nodes or run one yourself and then spend through the lightning network to get the advantages of instant secure payments and potentially lower transaction fees. You still send Bitcoin and Bitcoin transactions as before, but the lightning node does the heavy lifting of syncing large numbers of transactions.
Lightning doesn't exist today except in concept and very very early public code, and it requires an adjustment to the Bitcoin network to be able to work.

@_date: 2015-06-02 16:07:24
The issue is people can cheat. There is no way to know if someone is a real person or one of a billion fake identities controlled by one person
How do we know who helped on a block. Maybe someone just made a billion identities for themselves? How pools divide their winnings isn't part of the Bitcoin protocol so it would need completely new rules. How do the pools know that they don't have more than one of the same person?
The proof of work block reward is already a lottery system and people don't like playing it. Even though the reward is technically the same statistically, people themselves choose to join pools so they always get a small reward instead of sometimes getting a big reward.

I'm afraid that's not how it works in this case
Even if over 50% of miners mine big block type coins, the small block clients won't recognize them as valid. So if bitstamp stays with 1mb and big block miner tries to sell his reward there, he won't be able to deposit

So I'll write you down for a yes, 100% increase in scalability since you said it allows for a 2x increase in tps
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:41:59
1. There's no specific timeframe for a hard fork. 4MB is not yet considered safe, they will work on improvements to make it safe in the near term though
2. Segwit solves many problems and requires only miner support to roll out, it won't roll out immediately, there will be a period of dev and testing, peer review
3. Separating the signatures helps in other ways, such as allowing a new security modes where they are skipped. Changing how txs work wouldn't be backwards compatible and everyone would need to change, a riskier move
4. Clients can choose to use Segwit because it would be cheaper 
5. Miners would adopt Segwit because they can get more fees and they want to see the problems that Segwit solves solved to help grow Bitcoin
6. Segwit improves scaling because it allows more transactions in a block
7. Lightning has a well regarded white paper and is in active development so it seems very likely to launch and it's proposed that it would work in a peer to peer self bootstrapping way
8. Fund locking is a precautionary measure, users might not need notice any difference unless a failure mode occurs, in which case they would have to wait out the lock. This is expected to be a rare situation
9. LN transactions would confirm instantly and potentially cost less, while still being denominated in Bitcoin and not trusting funds to a third party
10. A limited block space was a part of the original design. Fees are mentioned in the original white paper.
11. Dynamic fee wallets are already very common and they can make predictions based on historic data. A new mode will be introduced to change fees in flight to interactively bid
12. Btcdrak has contributed to core Bitcoin so it just describes that he's involved. Anyone can show up, there's no selection process. Only some core devs are blockstream employees, core is not blockstream
13. Blockstream intends to sell expertise and customized solutions around Bitcoin and the open source products they create, similar to other open source companies
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:15:39
That situation exists today as miners don't have to pick up any transactions, you can try it yourself any time with a "low fee" transaction and see what happens
What will happen is that we'll start to see people paying more sometimes and paying less other times. When the network is busy it will only be processing higher fee transactions and when it's slow it will take a mix.
Even with higher block limits that's how things will probably work: miners won't want to take a chance on being orphaned so they'll keep their blocks small

Go to bitcoin.org and choose a wallet there, you don't need to clone a repository if you don't want to


Find a bitcoin vending machine or a trader on localbitcoins  or mycelium local trader or use libertyx. You can mine some for fun using 21 computer and things like that but it's just a waste of money compared to buying Bitcoin directly.


If you have a website I like the a-ads platform which will give you a small drip of Bitcoin without doing much


Check out the github for bitcoin and whichever you wallet you choose, there are also mailing lists for bitcoin discussion


It sounds like you are mixing up bitcoin clients with mining power. Miners can choose want software they run and they often develop custom solutions for themselves. There's only a very rough relationship between the two. For most things a Bitcoin client can be very customized without impacting the network in any significant way. Also all full nodes in the network validate what miners do so there is a limited set of bad outcomes that are all pretty unlikely since the miners are strongly incentivized to generally protect the value of Bitcoin
If the Bitcoin protocol changes, your Bitcoins value may be at risk, like for example if a segment of the Bitcoin user base decides to switch to an inflationary system like some altcoins. I don't think there's any way to stop that happening, but you can rest assured that your Bitcoins will remain trade-able with other people who stay on the legacy segment of the network (run an older client or older protocol). Like imagine if Starcraft was open source and p2p, you could always play Starcraft with other people who wanted to run the same version as you, even if a lot of the player base moved on to Starcraft 2 which was incompatible and you didn't like.

We've already seen huge currency shifts in our lifetimes, the move to the Euro, leaving the gold standard. Bitcoin has attractive properties that have prompted past shifts: universality- it works anywhere in the world. Limited supply, it does not carry the inherent loss of planned inflation.

The network doesn't really need more nodes for anything in particular, the current node levels are more than enough to distribute the blockchain and relay transactions
Full nodes aren't essential because of their numbers, that's cargo cult logic. They are important because if people are not running full nodes, they are not getting the full security guarantees that the blockchain design was made to provide.
Making it easier and better to run a full node is important to help people get those guarantees without paying too high a cost for them

I'd focus efforts on lightning and sidechains and other projects that will change the dynamic of the network dramatically and when everything is more settled, revisit the block size question
The block size limit I'd set it a bit higher for now and publish a guiding document about how it will be increased in the future and lay out the conditions for increasing it and try and push for the network to be able to accept a hard fork more quickly

You can just set a minimum relay fee, it won't destroy consensus. Confirmations can use one of two tactics to avoid being delayed: opt in RBF or dynamic fee assignment
I heard exactly the same argument six months ago that six months in the future we'd have these terrible changes. I don't see the evidence here. What I see happening is that fees start to rise and some percentage of transactions will leave the network due to fees. For example right now 40% of the transactions are $5 or less. With fees of less than 1% maybe that makes sense, but if we start seeing 3% or 5% those transactions will find an alternative

Hostage is an aggressive way to describe things, buying and selling is just the natural function of a market
In the simplest terms of the market, if a huge order to sell comes in, that changes the point at which supply meets demand and thus the price changes to meet that point
A lot of the market is also playing psychological games, there's no big reason a big seller or buyer has to place their order on the order books where anyone can see it, they can setup stealthy orders. So some orders can be setup to try and scare people into moving their orders in a certain way

If a new version bug creates a fork accidentally, then the new version is an accidental altcoin
Whatever a merchant calls Bitcoin is not relevant. They could use a version of fiat branded Bitcoin, I wouldn't consider that Bitcoin 
I'm not sure that you are a developer if you think the problems of merging code can just be glossed over. And who will fix these problems when there are no devs who want to?
I disagree about the majority part. If Richie Rich bribed a majority of people to use his inflationary fork of Bitcoin, it wouldn't make that Bitcoin. Maybe you'd call that Bitcoin, which is fine since you can decide that for yourself, but I wouldn't. 
Since as you say nodes must switch to a hard fork first, the miner vote is not really very relevant. But how do we know the miners won't do something stupid like switching before the nodes do? We just have to hope it's not in their interest and trust in the validation of the nodes to prevent this abuse.

Don't you really give yourself away when you describe a hard fork with soft fork activation threshold language?


The network is not miners
Also I don't know why you simultaneously call a group of developers "leaders" and then slam them for not doing what you want. They are only leaders if you think of them as leaders. You didn't elect them, they don't pay you, you don't pay them. If you want to follow Gavin or Jeff, you can call them leaders. 
The fact is that even Gavin and Jeff disagree on your "industry wide consensus of 2mb", they each have competing plans.
This also ignores that the vast vast majority of active devs on the project have signed a letter of intent on how to deal with the problem that a hard fork tries to solve. It's not just sipa or others linked to him, many others feel that there is a compromise and that they are ready to work on it.

One proposal is reworking how the fee is paid so that it's a back and forth process. The reason being, maybe your fee is so low you will never get accepted into a block, so you need some process for how to resolve that. Clients might have to be programmed to automatically do this, kind of a back and forth system. Sounds pretty complex to solve what seems like a small problem

It's a complicated system and it's still developing: it's not out yet, but here's my understanding of the plan.
1. You fund your lightning hub "wallet" (could even be your own hub). The funds can be sent with a NLOCKTIME transaction, using the blockchain, to whatever time you prefer. The key is to let the hub be able to guarantee you aren't double spending.
2. Now you have a balance on your lightning hub, and the lightning hub is connected to the global lightning network (similar to the blockchain, but not persistent)
3. Lightning hubs relay your transactions as "guarantees". They can't spend your money without you sending them the signed transaction. Lightning is faster than the main blockchain network because it only sends these guarantees and leaves the settlement as a worst case scenario, like escrow.
4. Every once in a while hubs settle up with each other, wrapping the net balance of transactions into a single transaction. Thousands of small transactions become a single big transaction.
All of this can be hidden behind a wallet interface. You still have to keep your own keys and verify things yourself, but the verification is simplified because the hubs are wrapping together many purchase transactions into few settlement transactions
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:42:44
I think that would work, except that all full nodes have different capabilities to process transactions and they are not directly represented in the mining market.
If miners had to pay full nodes to compensate them for including a lot of transactions then the nodes interests would be represented. The problem there is there is no mechanism to know if a full node is a legit part of the network and deserves compensation
If mining was really unbounded, I could make a deal with a miner where I give them $10/month and they make millions of transactions to use the blockchain as a file system and publish my encrypted photos backup to it. Making and publishing those transactions doesn't really cost a miner with a good cloud server very much, but it costs the rest of the network a lot. We need some fundamental opposing force to stop that.

Pretty much yes but practically the cops don't seem to be using this information too much, I it's more likely the coinbase or circle will kick you off preemptively 
In the grand scheme of things, Bitcoin illicit purchases are still tiny. It's too much hassle for the average person and the average person doesn't even know about it anyway. So if the cops are going to implement catching methods, they will use a wider net: intercept packages, turn dealers into informants, etc.
If illicit purchase usage grows, this will be an issue. You could reduce your exposure with things like or buying on localbitcoins with cash, but ultimately this is a game where you have an active opponent who can adapt to your moves and there is no way to win conclusively, the best you can do is to keep a lower profile than the others and hope the bear eats them first

A lot of problems with this. The costs of using Lightning should be expected to be far lower than the current costs because all Lightning does is model existing off chain transactions (which are already very cheap) in a decentralized way
- How many people are paying $0.23 on their Bitcoin transactions for coffee right now, I think you did the math wrong there?
- I think your blog misrepresents what locked money means on Lightning. It doesn't mean locked as in impossible to get out, the lock is just a guarantee against bad action not normal operation. You can still get your funds out in any normal situation
- The cost of Visa and Mastercharge and all these others is not the bandwidth or the channels or anything like that, it's the cost of regulatory and network effect rent. These companies spent a lot of money overcoming a huge barrier to entry and then trying to keep that barrier to entry high for other entrants. Now that they have this barrier they can charge rent for their position. The amount of money they spend on networking and computing costs is a rounding error
- A major problem with your article is that you compare Bitcoin in your wallet to Fiat in your bank. You say that you are losing money by having money in Bitcoin, but actually you have that backwards because of inflation. Straight up no-risk bank interest will lose you money over time. Also some banks in the world have started negative interest rates
- The 0.1% risk of "extra risk" seems like something you just made up for nothing. I could say there is also 0.1% risk for "extra savings".

@_date: 2015-12-10 07:53:01
I'm not sure I can put it correctly because it's still new and I'm still learning about it, but generally speaking the transactions in Bitcoin have both a "funds" part and a "signature" part and segwit separates them to fix problems related to them being together and to enable faster transaction processing on the network
The funds part is where is the money coming from and going to. The signature part is the authorization to move the funds. Currently they are bundled together, however this causes some problems, like people messing with other people's transactions or their transaction id by republishing them in a different format. 
Segregated witness fixes those problems through a reorganization of the transaction data that standardizes away the different formats. 
Additionally, there are ways to transmit signature validity that don't take up much space at all, so this means that if every transaction uses sigwit maybe 2-4x transactions could fit in the same bandwidth we have today, and I think validation would go faster too.

First, I reject the idea that all use of Bitcoin must be trustless. If me and my friend trade back and forth lunch money using a piece of paper writing Bitcoin balance on it and then settle up occasionally, I'm still using Bitcoin. If I make 3 trades on an exchange, I'm still using Bitcoin.
Second, there's another proposal out there that allows for other coins to be locked in value to Bitcoin in a trustless way, which is pegged sidechains. 
Third, there are all sorts of new proposals that we don't know about yet or existing proposals and platforms that I don't know well that offer promise to perform trustless transactions. 
Can you say there will not be more platforms for trustless trade of Bitcoin than simply Lightning?
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:57:16
I think this will happen, although how I think it will happen is that the devs and the miners will coordinate it, give everyone a long lead time and then program a switch to occur at a flag day. I don't know if that's the right way to do a hard fork, that's just how I see it happening

I've heard arguments that it should not be rolled out without some check on consensus because it is a big change to the protocol and maybe it's just a technicality that it doesn't need full node consensus.
Also I have heard that people think it could distract from the goal of getting more tx in blocks via simple block size expansion and hardware scaling instead of software optimization scaling

Miners have an incentive to validate because otherwise others won't accept their blocks and thus their block rewards, they will lose money on electricity
Users have an incentive to validate because they may accept a transaction from an invalid block that they either don't agree with (like breaking the 21 million rule) or they think the rest of the network won't agree with and thus the transaction will not have really happened from the networks' perspective (double spend)

Why is Monero bad for Bitcoin?
**Monero's bad for Bitcoin's growth**
It diverts focus from Bitcoin. Merchants should be able to say "we support Bitcoin" and not have tons of people ask them "when r u supporting my altcoin" Cryptos are easily interchangeable. There's only one reason people are doing that and it's to help pump their coin.
**Monero's bad for Bitcoin's credibility**
In order for Bitcoin to be talked about and used by the mainstream, it has to have a brand that inspires confidence. There's a lot of positives in Bitcoin's brand image: NASDAQ's experiments, VC investments, support from many brand name merchants. But there's endless negatives too: scams like Bytecoin or Litecoin that have to be explained away as "bad actors", "mistakes".
**Monero's bad for Bitcoin's development**
Developers shouldn't be rewarded for forking and diverting development from the main project. Bitcoin is an open process, with sidechains it will even invite totally different but still interoperable feature sets. The more reasons developers have to rathole on their own individual isolated projects, the fewer reasons developers have to compromise and join their efforts into Bitcoin development.
**Other Points**
- Why don't core devs have tons of their own altcoins for "experimentation" if it's so valuable for Bitcoin? I'm sure they'd be great at making altcoins and even have some good ideas for them. So far core dev involvement in altcoins has been pretty limited, true experiments not pumps looking for higher rank on coinmarketcap
- Openalias is not a "win", it's a random project that is one of many trying to solve the same problem. It may work, and the problem is valid, but the solution isn't obviously openalias yet.
- I can't visit your link because Chrome says it contains malware
- I'm not sure I can believe your claims of being divorced from the price, when you aren't contributing to anything other than monero / openalias. Your words say one thing and your actions say another.
- Bitcoin has a nascent community. It's far from a done deal, and trying to glom onto it with other competing coins that do almost identical things isn't fair game.

One of Luke's beliefs I've noticed is that he doesn't put a lot of faith in people, including himself to provide for their own information security. His reasoning was similar to why people keep their coins at coinbase: they aren't computer savvy enough to take the precautions coinbase will take
At some level I think it makes sense, but it's weird Luke would think he's so bad at security that he can't handle his own coins himself. It's also weird he'd work on a project dedicated to eliminating counterparty risk and then willingly subject himself to same risk
I had money with gox too, it was hard to avoid in the early days as they were the only game in town.

Well the user never sees this route calculation, the client figures out the fastest route, encrypts the routing instructions and hands it off. The user just presses "send". 
Each router would broadcast their existence to other peers so each client has a directory they can use to put together a route to their destination.
I don't know how the fees will work, so that there might be some weird edge cases for the UI where you are sending to someone very poorly connected to the network and it can't figure out a route. I don't understand how that will work, maybe it will just fail and the other party needs to connect to more nodes. Also I think there may be a UI problem with the connecting times and with the channel failure flow, those are my biggest worries
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:22:38
If transaction fees are going to pay for the network, then does anything that lets you bypass transaction fees hurt the security of the network?

These ATMs should have a way to pre book a purchase or sale so you don't have to worry about confirmation times and the operator can predict efficiently how to fill or unload the machine and price the coins. The price should react to both the market and the local supply of the ATM: when its full of cash: lowest cash price. When it's low on cash: lowest Bitcoin price. You have to prebook to get a predictable price
Also Bitcoin ATMs should not be called ATMs because they can't work the same way: it's more like a vending machine than a bank teller. Banks make money off of deposits, so they can provide tellers as a free service to encourage deposits. Vending machines make money off of purchases so they will always have to charge a fee. Calling it an ATM sets the expectation that it will be a free service.

It addresses scaling in various ways:
- More transactions possible within a block
- Easier to make more scaling changes with an improved version marker
- Removes bottleneck obstacle for larger blocks with a more efficient miner block sync
It does not offer a solution to allow unlimited numbers transactions per block, the best that could be hoped for out of these improvements and a little further would be an order of magnitude improvement in the near term
Some problems people have:
- Too slow, rollout now or within a few months
- Too tricky implementation, make all current clients break and do a less tricky implementation
- Too little, a full solution to scaling must be 4 orders of magnitude

My theory is that it's the core devs who screwed this up. They are reading from sheet music the wider community can't see and are making moves that appear random and destructive but make sense to their world view. I think that's why they pushed out some early pre alpha of lightning and the beta of sidechains, they are forced to illustrate their plans to the wider community to justify their actions
I think everything started with the floating fees fix. For a long time fees were fixed and we basically had a soft fork situation whenever we wanted to fix fees to the price. That's obviously a crap solution so the devs coded up free floating fees and put the price much lower because now we had a solution if the blocks were flooded: free floating fees
Now that the tx fee was way lower, people reacted by sending more transactions: not quickly or dramatically because we're talking $0.10 becoming $0.02 and it's just cents more, but that $0.10 still had a freezing effect on some transactions.
Today we have a situation where the market has had time to adapt to the low fees, but If you look at the graph it appears that adapt time is growth in users, when it's almost certainly at least partially the market adapting to lower fees and sending more transactions.
Anyway tldr: the devs set up the situation for the blocks to fill by lowering the tx fees, but they failed to set expectations or finish coding solutions for when blocks did fill.

Let's agree to disagree - you think your project is the rose amongst the thorns of the thousands of scam altcoins because your motives are pure and theirs are rotten

Bitcoin scams are bad enough of a problem, but at least those guys are just stealing, not actively trying to replace Bitcoin. If you want to be a complement to Bitcoin then you should put that on your press and not a bunch of misleading stuff about being private (making a monero transaction definitely does not mean you're untraceable)

There's another problem which is that miners can give up their mining power and give over hash power. If a low bandwidth miner can't collect fees because he can't include transactions in his block, his blocks will make less money. So he can just stop mining himself and redirect his hash power to a high bandwidth miner and then make more money. Increased centralization

There are a variety of wallets with the variety of user types in mind. I recommend Electrum which is a wallet written in Python that has both a server and a lightweight client component. Most all wallets that would be recommended on bitcoin.org would be open source so compiling it yourself and reviewing the code would be an option there. All wallets have pros and cons of course
You should use a new address for every transaction, that makes a wallet client pretty important as you may have to manage a number of private keys. You could make your own simple client if you wanted, Bitcoin Core has a simple RPC interface


I've used a Bitcoin vending machine and it took no information, but it is of course up to the operator of the machine.
Mining on your own to get 1 BTC would be very slow and very wastefully expensive, I would definitely recommend against it


Another option for local trades is the "cash deposit". Libertyx and localbitcoins have this kind of option where you just deposit cash with a regular ATM or a convenience store and you get Bitcoins. You don't need to meet up and you don't need to give over your identity, but your mileage on this may vary by location


Full nodes inspect each transaction to confirm that it is valid according to a set of rules of what transactions can do. A miner who claims a block reward of 50 BTC instead of the current 25 BTC reward will see his block simply disregarded by any full node because he cannot claim that much. Instead the full node will just wait for the next block that passes all of its validity rules and treat that version of history as canonical.

**On Security**
When you spend Bitcoin it involves publishing a signature you signed with your private key. Everyone can see this signature. Currently we depend on crypto to prevent anyone else from looking at this signature and using it to crack a similar signature or the private key. The type of crypto involved there is based on what we understand of current technology, not logic/mathematics like when depending on a very large random number to be very large and random. It's very unlikely to cause a problem and a lot of stuff depends on it working, but if your signatures are worthless after you spend them, there's no reward to cracking at all.
**On Mining Power and Centralization**
Miners currently have the power to include or not include transactions. The problem with that power is that miners can't really look at these transactions and learn a lot about them because people generally avoid reuse. Imagine if a pool operator doesn't believe in gambling, he can stop all transactions being mined that go to a known gambling address. Why should that single person have that power? Easy to avoid: generate new addresses for all transactions.

Transactions can already "take hours" since block times are random, 0-3 hours per block
The real question is not what happens when block times are hours, but when _every_ block is full for hours on end

Yeah that is the solution I want to see, I don't think the "natural" price for a transaction is zero, which is what it would theoretically be if infinite transactions could be included in a block.
It's scary though to think that if we do have Lightning or other off chain transactions that compete successfully with on chain transactions because of speed or other advantages, there may be very few on chain transactions even if people are still using Bitcoin. There's no way to stop that, so there's some risk that Bitcoin starts to really become successful but that success doesn't have a direct relationship to increasing mining security like you'd hope it would.

Well these past people can't control what future people do either. If people want to change, no one is stopping them.
Technical risks of increasing a block limit should be assessed and mitigated by developers who write code. So if people want to increase the limit, the right thing for them to do would be to write some code to solve the problems and risks inherent in raising the limit, and write code to test and demonstrate the safety of raising the limit. Or if they can't write code, they should pay other people to write it.
What they should not do is demand that other people do that work for free because they demand it

It's about half and half. You can't give rewards forever or that then lowers the rewards' value and defeats the purpose of giving them forever. 
The fees plus interested parties are supposed to secure the network. Some people won't want to depend on  the free ride of miners and will contribute to the network. The fees should in theory end up relating directly to the value of the system: more usage, more fees, more security.
If Bitcoin ends up not being used as a payment network ($50 blocks like we have today) but is used as a significant store of value, it will probably have to be changed to a fee model that works to secure rare but large transactions. The other alternative is to develop new trust / security features that don't rely on the miner mechanic.

Miners already implement a feature that favors older and bigger, so if your spam attack has lots of money but only new / small, the network will already deprioritize those
Miners can do whatever they want but it's hard to develop rules for what is spam and miners can just try to free ride on other miners to prevent spam, leading to a tragedy of the commons
I'd like to see miners deprioritize address reuse, that seems to have bad privacy implications and there's a spam attack where you can publish to known private keys and have someone else pay the fee to get the money out

BTC is for predictable inflation, which is still true off chain, and for last resort no trust transactions, which aren't needed for everyday frequent small transactions.

Just try buying a miner that will make money, and compare the hash power of the miner you will buy to the announced hash power of the mining equipment makers. Look for a minute at who is running the current majority pools, it's no coincidence it's all the big mining equipment manufacturers. 
Bitcoin doesn't work by longest chain, it works by longest valid chain. Miners don't get to define what is valid no matter how much hash power they have.

There was a new plan presented that avoids a hard fork and still increases the amount of transactions that can enter a block, my guess is that it will come within 1 year
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:14:13
The main objection is that it can't technically be done without the possibility of creating two versions of Bitcoin history and thus two different but similar coins. The more contentious the split, the worse the problems would be
- People's coins could lose value as Bitcoin splits into BitcoinA and BitcoinB
- It could be confusing about what to spend or what to ask for: BitcoinA or BitcoinB
- There could be way less hashpower if half of the hashpower goes for A and the other half goes for B
- People who didn't update because they aren't paying attention could go on a side of the fork they didn't intend to
- It could lead to two development teams that go in different directions, leading to slower progress
- It could lead to less combined effort behind promoting the use of a single coin, reducing the network effect benefit on both coins by more than just a factor of 2 since network effect is not linear
Some other worries
- Blocks that grow to insanely huge sizes might lead to insanely low fees since miners wouldn't have to choose between what transactions go in a block. Insanely low fees could lead to very low hashing power security if volume were not high
- Increasing the blocksize could do nothing tangible because there are other bottlenecks that haven't been fixed yet
- Making blocks bigger could give a benefit to miners with more resources, when to decentralize you want all players to be equal
- Bigger blocks could give a higher cost to run a node, reducing the net benefit of Bitcoin for people who run nodes
- Orphan rates could rise, meaning less efficient use of hash power, meaning lower security
- Not being able to run behind TOR or in other disguised ways could make Bitcoin potentially easier to ban and block, eroding some of its "store of value" advantage
-  Increasing the blocksize could be of minimal advantage for a long time because the existing blocks are not regularly filled to capacity
- Miners in China could actually get a big advantage by being in China since they can connect very quickly with themselves, giving a disadvantage to outside miners without servers in China to help spread a block quickly in China
- Increased blocksize could lead to a bigger barrier to entry for new users who want to use Bitcoin Core, it's currently at 60GB and can take days of verification to get started, those days could become a week+
- It could be a lot of effort and trouble for something that would never be needed due to other ideas about how to increase transactions per second
- Altering the core protocol without a compelling reason or without a strong consensus could erode confidence against future core protocol changes, so it could erode confidence in the 21 million coin market cap and other basic properties of the system.
- It's uncharted territory, something like this has never before been attempted
- High node operation cost could lead to the end of free lite wallets, you may have to pay a full node to offset their cost of operation
- Not everything may scale linearly, sometimes if you increase the size of something by 10x you actually see a 100x slowdown. That could lead to denial of service attacks on the network

Not saying your definition is wrong although I do think it is subjectively speaking, but usage could increase by 5000 times (say it's 1 million users today and so 5000 would mean almost every possible user) and without any change or side channels the price to send a transaction would be around the same cost as a wire transfer.

Low priority transactions are broken, every time you send a very low priority transaction you run the risk of it getting stuck. This is a fix for that.
Almost all merchants rely on payment processor software, these can easily be patched. Also if miners want to behave this way, there is no mechanism to stop them
The core devs have said publicly that the block size limit should change, although they disagree about the safety and efficacy of a change. There are other bottlenecks in the system than just the block size limit, for example we are seeing miners sending zero transaction blocks. Making blocks bigger will just make that problem worse. Blocks aren't even full right now so it doesn't matter too much what the limit is.

As a payment processor Bitcoin is pretty underdeveloped and fails to be great for a large number of situations. 
As a currency with predictable inflation and great reliability Bitcoin is doing pretty well and would scale to high levels
In the unlikely event of a massive burst of adoption, people would probably have to scrap using Bitcoin as a payment processor. We already are halfway there as almost all merchants use a centralized 3rd party to accept it payments. Bitcoin as a reliable and predictable network and unit should hold up fine though

This chart shows that the price has dropped from two years ago while the number of transactions has increased, so we must then reduce transactions to increase the price
@_date: 2015-06-21 15:42:48
Since everyone knows this fact, if you believe in efficient markets theory then people will bid up the price now to compensate for future coin squeeze, meaning the price will increase way before the squeeze happens. The last half point did not affect the price
Consider the reverse: if we suddenly found out that there would be 21 million new coins added by a secret Satoshi backdoor but it would only happen in 2016, the price wouldn't wait until 2016 to react: it would move immediately

Reusing addresses hurts your security and also hurts privacy for the entire network, not just you. It also gives miners more power, making the network more centralized.

Just so people know: hiding files in images is not considered to be anything but superficially beneficial to security. 
All known forms of hiding files in images are easily detectable and beatable. If you want to securely store your bitcoins use an encrypted paper wallet. 
Of course security isn't everything, if you want you can do what you like, just do it in the knowledge that you are responsible for the security of your own coins so you must store them carefully

There's no division in development of Bitcoin, all active developers of Bitcoin have differing views but are generally in agreement about what to do regarding block size.

Sidechains are like a protocol for 3rd party networks to interface with Bitcoin. These networks could steal your money. In elements it isn't even decentralized: 7 master keys are used because Bitcoin needs to release some upgrades before a side chain can be decentralized
Once your coins are in side chains they play by the side chains rules
The easiest way to think about side chains is that they are like altcoins that are not premined. Any altcoin could be a sidechain, by just losing the ability to print new altcoins and exchanging that for the ability to convert bitcoins into sidechain coins

You won't have to indicate your preference, the Bitcoin client will automatically ignore the other fork's miners because they will be mining on an invalid chain from your perspective

The minutes are based off of network and processing times, basically how fast can your transaction be spread all around the world so every single person running the software knows about it and knows you aren't trying something tricky like telling half the world one thing and half the world another thing to spend twice
If the gating factors of network time and processing time improve, like we get universal super speed computers and light speed communications, the time could be safely lowered
Otherwise there are other smaller scope solutions, like lightning which limits the transaction to a small network of powerfully connected nodes instead of all users. Or coin base and change tip which limit to just their internal database

Bitcoin was designed as a decentralized currency, but decentralization means there is no one around to react and adapt if there is an attack. 
One precautionary defensive rule in Bitcoin is there is a limit on the usage: 1mb of usage every 10 minutes. If the limit is exceeded, the miners who validate the transactions can't validate more than 1mb every 10min so they have to pick the ones they want to validate, but you can bribe your way to the head of the line by including a higher fee
Bitcoin hasn't generally been hitting this limit, if you ignore free transactions and some points before where miners kept limits lower than they needed to be. There's no super good reason the limit has to be 1mb exactly, so some people think it should be more. We're getting closer to the limit than ever before, but it's not a completely fair calculation because minimum fees were also lowered dramatically.
Changing the limit is extremely difficult because it requires everyone to upgrade, it's like as if Microsoft had to get everyone to stop using xp before vista could work.

We may already have a centralized block chain in the sense that there are only a small set of miners. There may already be a 51% party and we have no way of knowing it
No one has come up with any way to stop mining from being centralized, except some stupid ways like making a big fuss on reddit when the mining pool appears to be approaching 50% (mining pools don't have to publish their percentage and it's trivial for them to make it appear lower than it is - miners self report their identity on blocks optionally)
Mining is a market driven system so in theory there should be multiple entrants especially as the advantages for a large pool vs a small pool basically come down to smoother variance and nothing more. Markets aren't perfectly efficient though, we're still talking about a people driven system not a math driven one, so it's hard to predict what will happen or make anything that will conclusively prevent it from happening. 
The good news is that decentralization is a sliding scale and even with a 51% mining party it doesn't mean the end of Bitcoin because what they can do with that 51% power is fairly limited and what they would probably want to do with that power is limited even more. 
The 51% party could mess with the flow of transactions and they could make the confirmation process more suspect but they can't take bitcoins from people and they are strongly incentivized by the block reward to keep everything running normally and not mess with the system

Hard forks are easy providing that there is a consensus
For example to raise the 1mb block size, nodes could include code that said that in 6 months we will allow 1mb blocks. Everything would work as normal and nodes would have six months to update
The nodes that didn't update wouldn't be part of the majority fork and they would have a tough time spending their coins
If there were no clear majority/consensus, that would be pretty obvious and nodes could stop the future hard fork before it happened
Updates to the blockchain are super easy and smooth, as long as you have consensus

Opinions are divided on where Bitcoin is. Some people think that usage is already ahead or will shortly be ahead of the current hardware and software constraints. Other people think that Bitcoin is still limited by its limited adoption and there is no current or imminent issue.
Imagine the modern WWW but on old computers. They wouldn't be able to run modern web sites very well because they would be too slow and the software to run web sites fast would also be pretty primitive.
It's like if everyone played a super popular video game on their computer and then the minimum system requirements went up to enable fancier graphics. Not as many people could play, so some people would say: hey this sucks what about my computer. Other people would say: hey if we don't have fancy graphics we're just gonna get left in the dust by new games.
Both hardware and software would allow Bitcoin to scale. We couldn't go from where we are now to running all the world's transactions over night, it would not be possible with the current Bitcoin running on the current hardware. Not only that, it might never even be necessary as Bitcoin running all the world's transactions is a very very long shot.

No this is cargo cult thinking
This is one of the most dangerous problems with the BtC community 
Imagine BTC community as villagers on an island and sometimes there is an airdrop of food and supplies from the air, followed by some soldiers who eat some of the supplies but then leave later, leaving a nice harvest of free stuff
Making the target for the airdrop bigger or examining what was happening before the airdrop won't help, but it might feel like it helps. Even providing the soldiers with a great experience stationed on the island won't help when the war is over
The only solution is to take advantage of the current supplies to be self sufficient in a way that doesn't presume the airdrop will ever happen again. Bitcoin should be focused on being an understandably mature and self sufficient economy and that takes hard work, not looking at star charts and hoping for the next airdrop because it came last month

There will always be miners, the difficulty will adjust to match the power of the miners
Even at 1% of the current hashing power, the danger of 51% attack would be low for almost all users
Miners who will always mine:
- already bought the equipment
- have free electricity
- large vested interest in bitcoin
- believers in a free currency
- people who want "clean" BTC
Remember the network started with one miner. As long as there are people who believe, the network will be secure for the most part
The level of security we have now is pretty crazy high, it's a side effect of the coin distribution strategy, not a requirement for a healthy network
The real failure scenario would be that bitcoin would be targeted by a government or malicious entity that would attack for no real reason or no reason that seems plausible now. If the network were not a mainstream thing at that point, a bad actor could overpower and hurt the system.

It's definitely possible to have your money stolen or even frozen when using Bitcoin, since you can leave your money with a centralized service that like PayPal, can steal or freeze your money.
But it's also possible to keep your money out of any central service when using Bitcoin, so that it's impossible for anyone else to freeze your funds. You can also keep your funds completely offline so it's impossible to hack your funds. Those things aren't really features of PayPal, although some people might not care about that. Personally, PayPal has locked and taken money from me, whereas I've yet to lose any Bitcoin or have any Bitcoin frozen

They probably had very little on him since he didn't even really run the site, plus they accomplished nothing because the site is still around just with a different domain name. Prosecutors typically want and get 99% convict rates by threatening to go for crazy high sentencing while offering low sentence plea deals. 
The calculus is that they know people will plea out rather than take the risk, many innocent or not guilty of 100% of the charges type people are caught up in this corrupt system. This way the prosecutor can pick only 100% slam dunk cases to actually go to court with. 
Cops, prosecutors and judges, lawmakers, private prison operators in many many cases have systemic perverse incentives. Municipal courts want to levy extra fines to pay budgets. Private prison companies want bigger budgets, lawmakers and judges in some locales want campaign contributions from private prison companies. Prosecutors want cops to help them by testifying, cops want prosecutors to help them by not coming after them for malfeasance. Too bad we don't have a Bitcoin for the justice system :(

You now have a bunch of lite client using people who want everything to go over the blockchain, because they don't have to bear the expense of that option.

Bitcoins are stored on addresses and wallets are collections of addresses
Addresses are simply numbers that have a public and a private representation. If you know the private number you can spend the coins
If you use a wallet like multibit it will make a wallet file that you should backup (this contains all the addresses)
If you use a wallet like electrum it uses a master number that creates all the sub numbers so you only backup the master number. You still need to backup, but in that case only the master number

Imagine if you denominated everything in gold. Now if one person owned more than half of all gold does that mean he owns more than half of everything? No, he is just insanely rich.
What I'm saying is that the real wealth of the world is locked up in real estates and companies and resources etc. Any and all currency money supplies won't be very large compared to the total wealth of the world.

Good idea except how can I trust that the private key has no copy?
Maybe use Samir's secret sharing between 9 governments of the world and the company that makes the embedded number just writes the 10th secret and hopefully destroys it (since it's useless without the other 9 anyways)
Then when you find the 10th secret you approach the 9 governments with evidence of your trip and they reveal to you their 9 secrets

Why is there such public approval for Putin when he's out the country into such a terrible position?
If the problem to be solved is volatility in the ruble: people still have a lot of options: assets like gold, real estate, bonds and shares, foreign cash. What's the advantage of Bitcoin? It's still hard to use and not widely accepted, volatility will continue to be a huge issue if Bitcoin's value doesn't explode. The big advantage of Bitcoin is that it's borderless, but the situation in Russia isn't so dire that people are considering fleeing

This is a common confusion due to the difference between fiat banking and bitcoin banking
With fiat, your fiat is worth less and less every year, at a variable rate. This is called inflation. It's easy for a bank to offer a small rate of interest, even if it means just converting it directly into something that wouldn't be losing value and giving you just a smaller loss to inflation
For example, I am a bank and I take your fiat that has a 5% rate of inflation. I use your fiat, buy super safe assets with it like government bonds or other high quality debt, and then just wait every year for you to lose 5%. I then give you 2% back and call it "interest" and take the 3% to open branches and buy advertising on TV and issue dividends to stock holders
If you want a super safe asset, you probably don't want bitcoin as it's quite volatile. If you want your money to appreciate, you probably don't want to put it in the bank. If you want to gamble, try just-dice. If you want to invest, try the stock market or open your own small business

In theory it should have minimal movement on the price since it is known ahead of time but the bear whale was not - also consider that number of coins is less than a month worth of the new coins coming in every month

Is a non contentious hard fork also an altcoin? That's the hard question here, the others are easy: contentious forks are altcoins, accidental forks are altcoins
I think there are two answers to that, a group answer and a personal answer. From a personal perspective, each person can decide their own answer to what is an altcoin and be equally valid, as long as they come at it with equal assumptions. Meaning if I never accept XT as Bitcoin, even if every single other person does, that doesn't make me wrong, because there's no central authority who can declare me wrong.
For a group, the answer should just be arbitrary and specific to that group, there's no way to decide which side of a hard fork is correct, that's why we have hard forks, otherwise they would be easy to settle and we'd only have one blockchain
Even if the major changes in bip101 would take a long time to appear, it doesn't mean that exempts them from the possibility or prudence of being tested before they are rolled out.
I think you'll find if you look at the altcoins who copied Bitcoin closely, there is a struggle to continually merge in the changes of Bitcoin core. Even lukejr has problems rationalizing core changes with his alternative client
When you say consensus, you means mining consensus, which means 3-4 pools or maybe 3-4 people. That consensus does not map to node consensus which is something that I will decide personally for my node, which is what makes Bitcoin a decentralized system and not one run by a few people who operate mining pools.

Why are we paying these overdraft fees and payday loan fees and foreign exchange fees and why do banks have enough money to open branches on every corner and why do they need to when money is just information and you can do everything online.

This is possible but remember that there are huge legal problems with making a coin that can be converted to and from dollars. 
Companies, especially in the USA, will likely stay away because of the headache of the money regulations

It's possible but to a limit, only 144 mb can be added per day, which in the days of 6tb hard drives isn't that much
If they tried to choke out normal transactions they'd have to out price normal people, so basically pay more in fees than the normal person would
The network can change the transaction limits, it wouldn't be too tough to add more mb per day, especially if there was a profit motive for it for mining pools
It might be against the law, so people with enough funds to attempt it might be limited to renegade actors

There was some confusion about this
The minimum spam prevention fee was lowered, however the miners default fee was not
Miners decide what goes into a block and how big the blocks can be, not the core devs
In that update it made it easier for miners to accept lower fees, however they don't and maybe shouldn't, because of an issue regarding block propagation times. Currently a miner is incentivized to keep the number of transactions low, as the time to include the transactions can increase the risk of being beaten to a block

Even 2 confirmations wouldn't be enough. It's probably more secure to accept a 0 conf transaction from bitcoin than it is to accept a 1 conf transaction for any "faster" coin, since there are more nodes and mature systems for detecting double spend attempts
For a secure transfer of bitcoin you need 6 confirmations at 10 minute intervals (an attacker with 10% of the network power would then have less than 0.1% chance of double spending)
This is inherent to the blockchain solution, which is the only known decentralized solution.
The problem is that someone may be spending the same coins in two places, there is currently no known way to ensure that is not happening in a secure decentralized way in a very fast time frame. Simply decreasing the checking time is not a solution it just ignores the problem.
@_date: 2014-10-20 02:38:02
One reason people say this is because there are some problems with Bitcoin that would be solved if it were mainstream and highly valuable, but difficult to solve if it stays a niche product.

Your point of comparison is a time when there was a flood of demand but no corresponding flood of supply, that led the price to climb rapidly
Don't think of Bitcoin as a way to make money. Or a way to store value without risk of volatility. Bitcoin is a store of value without counter party risk

Bitcoin isn't going to solve corrupt politics or US imperialism, that's just not what it's about.
It could fix Wall Street, most of what's wrong there is due to a lack of free market competition. Bitcoin can make much of Wall Street obsolete, if the government doesn't get in the way too much
Bitcoin is also not and has never been a privacy tool. The blockchain if used very carefully can provide privacy though, I mean no one noticed mtgox was insolvent and no one knows where the coins went, even though there is plenty of incentive to figure those things out
All bitcoin is is a way to freely express who gave whom what. That is literally what the blockchain is, a transaction history. Bitcoin is about free expression and communication and nothing more.

Coinbase is not good as a bitcoin wallet, it's just good as a place to exchange coins and fiat
Coinbase should probably buy Trezor and make it easy for normal people to be secure using bitcoin by combining a secure hardware device with an easy to use web interface
Remember if you don't own your private key you don't own your bitcoins
That being said, coinbase support is slow and bad but they are not malicious, eventually if you pressure them they will help you. I've had lots of problems with my account and their buggy software and eventually they always solved it

Even if you are playing an even game with no house take, this is not a fair market, information is not equal, stakes are not equal, there is counterparty risk, basically unless you have some kind of unfair advantage like you know exactly when whales will enter or leave the market, the best you can hope for in trading is to approach 50% odds since day trading is a zero sum game.

Basically banks can provide risk free "interest" not because they are investing in anything, but because they are converting your money into a stable asset instead of a decaying asset
Your model of banks is outdated, that's how banks used to work but not anymore
Banks are now basically loan salespeople, they sell, classify, package and bundle and sell your loan along into big asset packages that are traded on markets to find a stable price
The "interest" you get on your deposits doesn't come from any loan the bank gave, it comes from the fact that the fiats are devaluing at a faster rate than any number of extremely stable asset classes. The bank just provides you liquidity against those stable asset classes. That these two are still linked is now an accident of history
The reason the economic crisis happened is that since the banks are separated from their loans, they now have basically zero stake in giving out good loans, they just care about reselling debt packages

Bitcoin adoption doesn't necessarily imply high price
Imagine a world in which many forms of ownership are in digital files: colored coins or side chains store a decentralized record of things like digital property ownership or corporate shares and bonds.
If such a market were mature enough, it wouldn't make sense to store significant amounts of money in Bitcoin where it would yield no return (Bitcoin doesn't create wealth), it would make more sense to store it in digital assets that are put into real use and need funding to grow. Bitcoin could be the common unit of exchange, but temporarily as people moved in and out of investments

All of those countries have issued strong warnings against bitcoin and they are also corrupt and authoritarian
Bitcoin is a threat to government power, what these countries resent about the dollar is that the US controls it, gets the "inflation tax" and they don't
Fiat currencies might also be better than bitcoin for developing economies in some cases, since a lot of the time the biggest barrier to a strong economy is not economic or political freedom, it's a weak government that cannot enforce the rule of law, or itself breaks the law. In those cases, giving heavy handed power to a benevolent or semi benevolent authoritarian ruling party can be the least bad of bad options.

The inefficiency is due to seeding the market
It will wear off and the market will be efficient by definition, why do you think miners will mine? To get transaction fees. 
If the fees are too high, they will get a low volume of transactions and more transactions will go off chain until the fees lower. If the fees are too low, the miners will push the fees up to reduce insignificant traffic that consumes excessive resources
And computers and bandwidth are getting better all the time. Even though the network is inefficient it has a valuable property: it is free and anyone can participate. That advantage will stay around, the disadvantage of inefficiency will reduce over time

There's no point to it other than a rejection of the current banking system which is corrupt and anti-innovation
By holding you are making a firm statement that you should have the right to own your own money directly
Some hold arguments take the form of "if you hold then you will make a lot of money", of course if you believe in the perfect market theory then that is a false argument

The Blockchain is more important
Bitcoin's utility is half blockchain tax payment (transfer fees) and half store of value
The blockchain has a lot of potential for fixing one of the biggest decentralized network problems: free riders. Think how BitTorrent was able to fix the free rider issue by giving you faster downloads proportional to your upload. 
Now imagine all networks free of free rider or centralization issues: email without spam, cloud storage without NSA spying, giant mesh networks instead of cell providers and ISPs, EBay without the scammers and high fees, BitTorrent where money can fill in for upload speed. 
Blockchains can make that possible since they fill in the missing piece of the puzzle, how to punish misbehavior and reward desirable behavior without a centralized arbiter. It will take a long time to realize these solutions though, just like we are still seeing the results of computers, Linux, and other software and other inventions

I look at Bitcoin as a store of freedom not as a store of value, meaning it's not investment or savings it is a way to protect my economic freedom

Even before confirmations are made, your tx is broadcast to all the nodes to put it in the confirmation queue
If the nodes receive another tx that attempts to double spend, the standard protocol is to throw it out
There is absolutely nothing stopping nodes from allowing double spends before confirmations, however they don't currently choose to do that, in order to improve confidence in zero confirmation transactions
Since this is the common protocol among miners, it's unlikely at the moment you will be able to double spend very easily. The protocol can easily change here but there are no plans to change it

Lending will be no more expensive than now, in fact it will probably be cheaper
The money banks make is not fairy money, it's money just the same way bitcoin is money. Remember that all money is is a ledger of who owes whom what.
The only difference between fiat and bitcoin is that bitcoin follows well defined rules for how new currency is created, whereas fiat has no clear rules: it's subject to the whims of whoever is in charge of the govt at the time
Risk is already priced into the bank equations. Banks buy insurance to offset their loans and deposit risks. They can do the same with bitcoin. (They did the same with gold before when banks lent money backed by gold and this worked for thousands of years)
You might say well what about the govt? If banks fail they have the power to make new fiat and solve all the debts. Well first consider that making new fiat doesn't really "solve" anything other than making what was once a single banks problem into everyone who holds fiat problem (inflation is a tax on fiat holders, money doesn't just come from nowhere). 
Then think, ok banks and bank investors know that there is no chance of a bailout. That means the future is more predictable, meaning there is less need for risk offsets, meaning the total cost of the system is reduced. 
This will also reward banks and investors who are responsible and don't take dumb risks, counting on inflation as a safety net. 
Of course this supposes that bitcoin is less of a risk than fiat, because fiat can be arbitrarily created by an unpredictable source (government). If bitcoin has a flaw or people stop using it, add those risk factors to the total cost (all risk has a cost). The more momentum bitcoin gets, the lower that risk becomes, the better an alternative it is against fiat or gold

You can buy and sell bitcoins for cash on localbitcoins that's the point of it
The premium is for the fact that localbitcoins exists as a buyer and seller in many situations where an online exchange is not a good solution
However shops that take bitcoin can generally use online exchanges without issue and they price their goods according to the online exchange price they will receive
If you are buying on localbitcoins it's true that the utility of the coins is lowered since you have to pay a premium. You can still use those coins as savings since volatility can cause as much change in price as the premium usually is. 
Localbitcoins coins are also better for situations where you want to retain your privacy since it's hard to track cash to bitcoin links

Take a lesson from this
Money is a token representing and abstracting debt. If you do something that will place people in your debt, for example doing some work for someone, your supply of the tokens will increase
Ok then what did early bitcoin buyers do to place people in their debt? They gave shifted fiat to miners who ran the system and needed fiat compensation for the operational cost or risk of their operation. 
Risks have decreased since then. When bitcoin was very cheap, it could go from $30 to $2, which would be like it going to $30 today. The flip side: utility potential of bitcoin has stopped rising as well, if you look at transaction volume the real use indicators don't show huge growth like they once did
Since risk is lower and potential reward is lower, this means you are not doing as much to help people by offering your fiat for bitcoins, therefore you will not receive as much reward as early buyers 
Maybe the visible evidence is incorrect: the market is not perfect and there could be a much lower risk and a much higher utility potential than is represented. If you believe that then buy more or sit tight and you will be rewarded for that, or if you believe the reverse: sell

Betting is a zero sum game: for every winning dollar there is a losing dollar
Investing is not a zero sum game because new wealth can be created: there can be more winning dollars than losing dollars. This is because new efficiencies can be found leading to an unbounded market size
As an example: in a poker game, at the end of the night no new "wealth" was created. In an economy that starts very basic and ends very advanced: new wealth was obviously created there. The wealth of the economy is unbounded, there are always more efficiencies and new advances. The wealth of the poker game is strictly bounded by the amount of money bet

Bitcoin is 100% consensus based, except when it comes to transaction timing which is majority mining power based.
The majority mining power can dictate when transactions are processed, or block them altogether, which is why it's a good idea for everyone to always use new addresses for every transaction so that the majority couldn't figure out how to block a specific person
Everything else about bitcoin: how much is in a block, how fast blocks arrive, who has how much, etc: these things are decided by consensus: every node in the network independently confirms all the other rules and won't operate if the rules are broken
If there were a malicious change by the core Devs, there would be plenty of time and eyes to see it. If it got past people anyways which is possible, a rollback might happen, which could be pretty bad. It's very unlikely because even small changes are very slow to be adopted
Bitcoin has already hit a point where major breaking changes are quite unlikely since too many people would have to update. More likely is additive changes. For example the web didn't start with JavaScript: it was added and you can still turn it off. For many pages they will still work, for other sites they won't. The same will apply to bitcoin: stealth addresses for example provide a way to send to a static address without revealing that in the transaction. As it's an additive change, it can't break the underlying protocol and you can choose if you want it

Eventually some hodlers would break, and as it seemed more likely that they would break, buying would wait for when they did
The price is all about expectations, it can go up because people expect that more people will expect that some people will buy, and in the end the variance and volatility can be nothing more than these expectations
In the long run where fundamentals matter, eventually holders will sell just because they need to buy things. True new entrants to bitcoin, not just speculators, they are the only ones who could keep the price up in a stable / long term way

You are coming from a fiat system where growing your money is imperative just to stay even because your money is always shrinking from inflation
In Bitcoin there will be no inflation except for the initial coin dispersal mechanism, so your coins should theoretically hold their value over a long time, all things being equal
Also Bitcoin itself is like cash, not like USD. If you own a $5 million dollar house you don't own $5 million USD you own the property worth that much. If USD appreciates in value, the house itself might "shrink" in value to compensate. 
Basically you can't have your cake and eat it too, if you want to "make money" you need to invest in things that might actually contribute to the economy like new business ventures or people. Digitally speaking it's still difficult to make those investments because of trust, but you can do the work yourself of finding trustworthy recipients who need your Bitcoin and will repay it in the future
Another problem is that Bitcoin is a volatile asset. You don't want to lend based on Bitcoin value because it's going up and down. Better would be to lend based on an index of various currencies and commodities that are generally stable.

Bitcoin doesn't have the services it needs yet but eventually it might
1. Send money anywhere in the world, with minimal fixed fees
2. Use metered cloud services that don't sell your data or spam you and only charge you for what you consume
3. Use decentralized cloud services to save all your photos and data, no company or service to worry about changing or dying and taking your photos and data with them. 
4. Buy anything you want anywhere in the world from any country
5. Sell your services to anyone in the world from any country
6. Borrow any amount of money at a fair market rate, from anywhere
7. Contribute to online services that give you money for usefully contributing instead of useless karma points 
8. Store any amount of wealth on your person securely 
9. Play games of chance with fair and minimal house stakes 
10. Keep your total amount of wealth a secret from every possible person or government
11. Lend any amount of money to anyone in the world and be compensated 
12. Have an autonomous agent that carries out your wishes after your death without human help
13. Buy and sell securities and asset shares without expensive or advantaged middlemen
14. Avoid any trips to the bank ever
Just because these things are all possible doesn't mean they will happen or will happen soon. AI is demonstratively possible and so is going to Mars and so are electric cars instead of gasoline cars, but even though we know in the future we'll probably get there, there is no way to know how soon or even ever

Not really a fair point considering that many people are not their own bank (use a service to store their coins) or misuse bitcoin software leading to mistakes
With bitcoin you could accidentally send a million bucks if you were not careful and that could be hard to recover depending on whom you sent it to (oh sorry satoshi dice I didn't mean it)
The banking systems "blockchain" isn't your account readout, it's the network of people and relationships and regulation that has formed over hundreds and maybe thousands of years.

There are multiple things at work
1. It's very hard to double spend even a zero conf transaction if it gets good network propagation. That's because most miners only take the first transaction they see.
2. If you use a VPN, they can detect a double spend later and rescind the service, no big loss
3. Most people wouldn't steal like this, their cost per user isn't so high
4. There are not a lot of programs yet that even help you try double spending

Bitcoins are like baseball cards
- OK it's true, baseball cards have value and bitcoins have value. Baseball cards aren't very fungible though and they have to be physically moved, so they have some disadvantages for transferring value
Changetip is run by a random person
- Indeed it is run by someone random, so you should not trust changetip with any significant amount of anything. Hopefully people will learn this
Changetip keeps your email
- They don't require an email to sign up so this is factually incorrect
Changetip charges a fee
- They charge a fee theoretically in the future, but anyone who wants to can copy their service and make a lower fee
Changetip could use another method of settling accounts
- I'd be interested in hearing about an example of a superior method of settling accounts. Baseball cards are not superior because they have a high delivery cost and are not very fungible. Actually I think changetip should give you the option to cash out in gift cards in a partnership with gyft - then you could settle your account any number of ways.
Changetip could settle balances with baseball cards instead
- Changetip could do that, you are welcome to start a baseball card service and see if people go for it

No because of the zero sum market problem. Life is not a zero sum game, trading when it's to efficiently allocate goods and services, etc is not a zero sum game because we can always get better
Stock markets can increase in value forever because of new technology and improvements from companies can keep rewarding companies that come up with new ways to increase productivity and demand. Commodity markets can never increase in value because they are about rewarding predictions, which can never be more than "correct"
Think of it this way: I have an economy that is based on farming. We also have a betting market about the weather. The economy can grow and add industry, and the betting market can get more accurate, but where the net goods in people's pockets grows with the addition of industry, the net goods of the weather betting market stays the same forever. (People just get more accurate and less volatile weather reports)

Find people who are willing to work for bitcoin and not spend it
The best chance for bitcoin success is for closed loops to form where people spend and earn bitcoin and never hit fiat. 
Without closed loops, the efficiencies of bitcoin are being lost to the exchanges. You spending $100 on bitcoin to spend at newegg and newegg turning that into $100 fiat again to pay their supplier is a very small efficiency win, it's potentially even less efficient
Closed loops don't have to be very convoluted. If you have a friend with a website that has a lot of traffic in June and you have a website with a lot of traffic in December, you can make a deal where you pay him for ads in June and he pays you for ads in December.

They are high because the cost of bitcoin has risen faster than developers can make changes
In the next version it will be much lower 
The version after that it will be free floating so it should always be low no matter the price of a bitcoin, in theory if they manage to finish that feature

Doesn't this argue for currentc? Merchants are sick of getting screwed by middlemen like apple who want a cut of every sale
Currentc could be insanely good for Bitcoin - imagine your phone scanning a qr code which then relays that to a wallet service that pays the QR code and deducts Bitcoin from your account
Compare that to apple's system that is so locked down that even nfc chip isn't open to developers
Daringfireball is a paid apple shill so take his writing with a grain of salt

The problem with bits is confusion around payment amounts
If you think in bits, you might send 10 bitcoins instead of 10 bits 
The best solution for me is that there is a currency chooser on every Bitcoin "send" interface: the default is "$local currency": USD or EUR because it's going to be the default for a while
If you want, change your default to bitcoins or a subunit, like bits or whatever you like
Bits can keep their definition of amount,  even though it clashes a bit with the more technically accurate "microbits" and millibits
I think at the end of the day the best unit will be Satoshis, it's not too annoying to deal with very large numbers

Yes, but buy bitcoins as an investment in yourself, not the bitcoins. If things work out with bitcoin, they will become an important part of the world economy. Buying and using bitcoins now will give you familiarity with how they work and give you an economic advantage on your greatest asset: yourself 
Economics generally works like this: help people and they will reward you with money. Help people have a burger: they will give you money. Help people with a loan, they will give you money. Buying bitcoin and then forgetting about it isn't helping too much, a better investment is in yourself so you can help people more effectively later in life.
Tldr: buy some but not too much, and don't forget to actually learn how it works and really use it

More jobs need to be created that pay in Bitcoin, which would remove the 1% fee (assuming coinbase fee and not circle's real 0.5% fee or 0% claimed fee) from the consumer side. 
There is no real reason bitcoin to fiat needs to have fees, it's just an immature market and fees exist to take advantage of that, someone needs to help facilitate the trade and that someone needs to be compensated, however it's a commodity market which means the prices should trend down
Creating Bitcoin jobs is a slow process, however Bitcoin has a great advantage for international commerce since it is borderless and allows for quick small transfers which are difficult with wire systems and western union
The real advantage of Bitcoin is freedom, which is a hard sell since people mainly just care about their base needs and desires and not their natural rights.

If you believe in crypto actually gaining traction, bitcoin is a good place to put money you can afford to lose: so that you can be part of the future and have the freedom to be your own bank
Buy and spend bitcoin to help nurture the nascent ecosystem
Don't look to it to get rich quick or even slow, that is just not knowable: there is zero reason to believe you will get rich quick or slow from bitcoin or any altcoin, your money you don't want to lose would be better invested in more well known investments such as bonds or index funds that offer a small but low risk annuity

Switch to p2p pool
As soon as double spending occurred, exchanges would start to notice it and roll back and take additional precautions like waiting for many more confirmations, stricter identity documents or they would close and exchanges that did that would open and take over
It would create a lot of publicity and miners would switch more readily, a lot if them don't sell and have a vested interest in BTC value going up
It's not just a 51% magic number that is dangerous, even ghash's current hash rate can start to mess with the network, if they wanted to. 
If they were truly malicious they would just point their hashing at another pool to look smaller, or not register their identity at all
There are already solutions being worked on to prevent a pool operator from having too much power, they are not easy to use yet but slowly they should take over as they are developed

It means some people think that bitcoin is not protected free speech and people should be limited in their freedom to send messages via the blockchain
For something to not be free speech usually this means it can cause demonstrable harm: shouting "fire" in a crowded theater when there is no fire (note that if there is a fire then it is protected speech)
So regulation means that in situations where bitcoin messages cause harm there should be a law penalizing that activity and an enforcement agency tasked with enforcing that law
In the modern US govt's way of thinking, contributory acts leading up to a crime can also count as crimes themselves: such as forming a criminal organization is a crime even if no crime is committed or even in addition to the crimes committed. This is something like "intent to commit a crime", like planning a murder is a crime even if the police stop you before you do it
For bitcoin this could be something like "sent bitcoins with the intent to buy illegal contraband"

Many many places you can put your money are going to change in price all the time: stocks, real estate, private lending
If you didn't realize that when putting your money in Bitcoin that it was volatile you were not paying attention
At the point the best use of Bitcoin as a store of wealth is to store your freedom to have it. No one can take it away or tell you where you can take it or what you can do with it, no one can even know how much you have. That's unlike any currency or asset in the history of the world

1. Looking at a donation address is not always possible, and can easily be meaningless since you can just give money in a circle to yourself or change the address. It's even recommended that every transaction use a new destination address

Buy and hold works only if you know the value will increase in the future. That is not knowable, so it's a bad idea unless you are wanting to gamble money
You should buy things with bitcoin now because currently the financial system is an oligopoly of interests that are charging an invisible tax on you, they are literally taking your money from you. Bitcoin makes payment processing a free market anyone can join, meaning lower processing fees and ultimately lower prices for everything, more efficiency
Buying things with bitcoin or really anything other than the current financial system means that the current financial system then has more competition: competition in the marketplace is ultimately good for you as a consumer

It depends on which side initiates - two warriors stare at each other across a field, they charge into each other and clash, exchanging blows and backing off. Slowly they move forward and backward across the battlefield
The key is whoever initiated the trade sets the price movement
The price is just the dividing line, if a seller moves first, the buy side wins and the price goes lower, if the buyer moves first the seller wins (gets higher than the buyer line price) and price goes higher
People say "everyone's selling" because if there was more buy pressure than sell pressure then there would be more *buys initiated* than sells even though every trade is both a buy and a sell of course

In theory these devices can use multisig which would protect against an interception by forcing a join from a second private key that you generate and combine another way: both sources would then need to be intercepted to attack you (buy n number of Trezors or different devices and combine the keys)
In practice Trezor went with a less secure but simpler and faster to market solution, it should be good for medium amounts of money but not lots of money. The best for lots of money is still a paper wallet

Now that coinbase is offering the rebuy bitcoin after purchase option they can do this: 
1. User hits pay with bitcoin
2. Coinbase triggers ach transfer
3. Coinbase fronts the merchant cash
4. User still has the same amount of bitcoin (bitcoin was never even actually used)
This means that all purchases between coinbase merchants and coinbase customers would have a flat tx fee basis of $0.15 (ach fee)

His points aren't really thought out and that probably comes from willful ignorance so answering won't help
1. If you think the international finance system is more efficient than wait 1 hour and pay 0.05$ for 99.99999% secure transactions - you just never did any international transactions - it costs me $45 wire fee plus days of waiting
2. Bitcoin can do anything the current centralized systems can do because logic. You can make new centralized systems based on Bitcoin as necessary: see changetip. Chargebacks, fast payments are possible and not that hard
3. Another logic fail: mtgox is bad which means you can never trust any third parties with anything. Bitcoin can be hard to use the same way Unix can be hard to use, wait what are all the billions of smart phone built on top of?
There are legit reasons to be skeptical of Bitcoin success: maybe it's too complicated for developers and regulators that it won't be welcomed into the mainstream. Maybe there will be bugs or issues that weren't anticipated that harm the network in some ways (mathematically impossible to make current private keys invalid though)
Another possibility is a better coin or just a centralized solution or solutions that steal use cases from Bitcoin and solves them "good enough" so that bitcoin's decentralization and Freedom is not as much of an apparent advantage

There are only three solutions for instant confirmation times 
1. You can trade through a trusted address controlled by someone who would probably not double spend (people think this is bad practice though)
2. You can trade off the chain through a trusted arbitrator (like coinbase)
3. You can wait for the bitcoin network and the Internet to become hugely faster. The delay allows time for all nodes to sync: lowering it will cause many small forks that are seen in Altcoins with short times
Maybe a trusted arbitrator in a m of n transaction would work too? I'm not sure

The best investments are things that actively help people: property to live on, companies to make stuff, loans to governments to create public projects 
Bitcoin holdings help no one, they sit in the blockchain and do nothing except stabilize the price of bitcoin to some degree (but only marginally)
Of course the problem with actively helping people is that people's needs are changing. Eventually I expect bitcoin price to be considered a "stable" "no interest" type of cash. Of course inflation protected cash, which is what I think is the true utility of bitcoin, putting your money in the bank does not protect against inflation

There is no counter argument to price drops: volatility is a concern for the use case of moving fiat through Bitcoin

Gold has tons of competition, as a store of wealth: land, cash, bonds, stock. As a rare shiny metal: silver, platinum. 
Bitcoin may be subsumed as the premier coin that's true, but the same could be said about anything, why is coca cola stock valuable when Pepsi or some other brand could make a fizzy drink just as easily. Bitcoin itself has some advantages that will take a competing coin work or an advantage to overcome 
Finally bit coins on mtgox aren't worth $100. They are worth 100 goxbux which are not dollars. That whole market is a world into itself since you can only deposit you cannot withdraw. It's not fair to compare that to bitstamp or btce or bitfinex, where money flows in and out and their versions of currency are very close approximations of the real deal

The coin limit of Bitcoin is logically impossible to break, unless you think an Altcoin could ever take over the semantic name "Bitcoin"
The number of cryptocoins altogether is limitless though, and some altcoins are even designed to print new coins for miners forever. Side chains are just altcoins that complement Bitcoin by pegging their core value to bitcoin 
I suspect the the reason for the Bitcoin hard limit is to help bootstrap the currency and make it seem more valuable for early adopters. Inflation and deflation are bogeymen: the real problem with fiat inflation is that the wrong people benefit from inflation and the inflation rate is not predictable.

The problem is you are protecting against the wrong thing
The thing to worry about with brain wallets is randomness. You need to have a good way to not choose something guessable.
If you choose 12345 as your brain wallet, well pbkdf2 blah blah fancy hashing won't do anything. So you need to choose a fundamentally non guessable password.
The amount of guessable passwords is not that large, but it's easy to make the mistake of using one. After all probably 99.999% of regular passwords people use with websites are super weak brain wallet passwords but they feel secure since they seem to work for websites
People who post about getting their brain wallet hacked make posts from time to time. They invariably chose a phrase that can be googled, meaning it can easily be part of a rainbow table. 
It's true that pbkdf is a good password hash and it's slower to do the hashing step of pbkdf than sha for rainbow table creation, but it's not so slow that you should feel safe with a weak brain wallet phrase. What takes your computer 3 minutes may take a future computer 3 milliseconds. 
With rainbow tables the hashing cost is paid only once, so you should expect to go against an adversary who has orders of magnitude more computing power than you and many years of time to build up a database.

I'd still encourage you to read more about Bitcoin, to become educated on what it is exactly.
Bitcoin can still have an advantage for you, but it is not a commercial advantage it's a philosophical advantage. 
If I gave you a software program and I said: here is this program, it will let you say whatever you want and no one can stop you saying what you want. You probably would say: "I can already say what I want, and no one does stop me so why should I care?"
Same thing with Bitcoin, "I can already spend my money without the central authorities bugging me too much, why do I care?"
The reason you should care is that your freedom is an intangible good that you should place value on even if it has no practical purpose. Maybe you never get arrested: you should still fight for due process and fair treatment. Maybe you never get censored: you should still demand that others are not censored. Owning Bitcoin is a philosophical statement that you have the freedom to own wealth, and the freedom to trade that wealth however you see fit and no one can stop you. 
51% attacks and anonymity are distractions: these aren't problems bitcoin is designed to solve but they are solvable. Same thing with chargebacks and airline miles and all your trivial niceties, bitcoin is not designed to provide those, but solutions will come in time. Bitcoin is really about one thing and one thing only: free expression

Brain wallets should be secured by being just as random as dice etc. Normal brain wallets are never brute forced by trying all combos, they are brute forced by matching against databases 
The salt in pbkdf is supposed to be a random value not part of the password, it should not be reused
Pbkdf has a problem that CPUs get faster all the time and maybe specialized hardware will be made for it (see asics vs CPU mining)
The final issue is that you might be lulled into a false sense of security. The only way to truly trust a scheme like this would be to use a truly random brain wallet, and if you just can do that the sha kind should be just fine

The law is wrong 
Violating an illegal law is not a crime
Bitcoin is speech and should be protected by the first amendment of the us. It shouldn't be against the law to "talk" to someone who in turn "talks" to drug buyers who in turn "talk" to drug sellers.
Bitcoins are simply very simple messages. It's a us right and a human right to communicate without fear of government punishment

It is being worked on, there is a dev team behind bitcoin you know
1. For more transactions we need a better fee structure that is market based
2. For a market based fee structure we need miners to be more incentivized to carry transactions
Both of these issues are being addressed at the highest priority in bitcoin dev
What you are dreaming of is also not something bitcoin is designed to do, in times of stress like a bitcoin party it is designed to increase the fees so that the party calms down, this is a protection mechanism: the blockchain doesn't and can't know the difference between a party and an attack
The other factor to consider in solving this problem is that hardware is getting faster at a good rate. This will mean worrying less about bandwidth and hard drive space, and the artificial limits on bitcoin can then be lifted

Think about what life was like at a time when the power to broadcast information and discussion was limited to a few: the printing press, the radio then TV. When Internet came around it took this power from the few and gave it to everyone, including you, which lets you broadcast this very question to the world.
The flow of money and capital right now is limited and controlled by a few, just like TV and radio and printing press were back in their day. Bitcoin is an extension of the internets revolutionary power to democratize information exchange, in the form of money, which is really just a history of debts
When you use Bitcoin you are saying "I am a part of a future where the power to control my money is mine, I own it and I don't need a limited few to act as the gatekeepers". 
There will always be trade offs and normal money will always have its place, just like books and tv and radio are still here. But this is a new power that you have access to for the first time in history. You owe it to yourself to try it out

Bitcoin is at a very immature stage. We just saw almost 10% of all the coins be lost to a thief, that is some major news that would not happen in a mature market
If adoption and development progress, there will be more stability in the system as it will be much more expensive to move the price and there will be fewer day to day changes that can have a large overall effect on bitcoin
A lot of people are buying bitcoins with the idea that it is a game where they can get rich quick, which is a zero sum game with no winner. The only way real new wealth will be created with bitcoin is if bitcoin is used to create new efficiencies or new solutions for people's problems, this will require companies and work and they will create the wealth around bitcoin. Because a lot of the focus of bitcoin is around the get rich quick buy low sell high aspect, this leads to volatility as people try to beat each other buying and selling early

It requires someone of a certain intelligence and creativity to imagine a better future that bitcoin represents. Of course it might be a different blockchain or a different name, but our eyes have been opened and can never be shut

The market cap of Bitcoin is not a real thing it's just a thought experiment: "if you were to buy all the coins at the current market rate how much would it cost". That's basically impossible since not all people would sell and definitely not all at market rate, so don't read into the market cap number too much.
The value of Bitcoin comes from demand and anticipated future demand. The number of people demanding Bitcoin varies in number and intensity every second. And the anticipation of future demand is even more volatile. So think of the market rate as the best guess for how much coins are worth and not a solid figure. 
The guess will change all the time, by itself it doesn't mean anyone is losing or gaining anything, it's just an indicator. If the price goes up it doesn't really mean everyone is richer since if everyone tried to sell the price would go down right? Market price is useful for marginal movement in and out of Bitcoin and general estimations only.
Btw this goes for everything that can be bought and sold, except Bitcoin is a bit more predictable than most things since the supply is mathematically fixed and can't be a variable in the price equation

To service them, full nodes must keep not only all the data around on a disk, but also ready to send out.

You are wrong
Bitcoin is a store of wealth, but it does not create wealth by itself
For example if you are the maker of an amazing new invention that everyone needs to buy, you have an asset: your invention. Just because Bitcoin exists doesn't mean your asset is worthless. People will continue to have many stores and generators of wealth: houses, factories, mines, themselves, etc
Bitcoin is just a digital asset that anyone can use to store their wealth. If you are worried about people with no wealth, consider that those types of people are generally paid in fiat and store their money directly in fiat cash. And what does the government do? Print more fiat so that the poor person is paid less every day, and has less savings every day. Rich people? They already have their savings and much of their money generating assets in inflation proof assets like real estate, bonds, and stock indexes. So fiat is really a tax directed at the poor. Bitcoin is a way to escape that tax

There are lots of parties who are important in a hard fork, it's not just miners and core devs
None of the current core devs are even proposing a hard fork, the hard fork promoters are a previous core dev and a Bitcoin wallet dev. 
Hard forking has to be something that's overwhelmingly obvious otherwise bitpay, Coinbase, full nodes, miners, electrum servers etc may fork and create greater problems than the hard fork solves

Bitcoin is somewhat based on Gold, which has a following based on its historical properties as an eternal store of wealth in addition to its convenient currency properties and shininess.
What you're describing re: changing the data is not all that probable, the record of the blockchain will undoubtably live on even if it's not as convenient to download, there will always be copies of the file floating around.

Sorry you made a mistake I hope this taught you a lesson about being careful with your money. Nothing you have mentioned is a new problem, slow progress is being made on all these fronts, and it's true that Bitcoin is now a household word, I wouldn't equate that with meaning it's now over
Unfortunately in a free market there can be your type of irrational actors who buy without thinking and then sell when they realize their mistake. This causes a huge chain reaction or bubble effect: market volatility.

Price going up and down randomly does not indicate manipulation, that is what happens in a healthy free market
Manipulation would be an external factor like DDOSing the blockchain or the exchanges to drop the price, buying low and then stopping the DDOS and selling when the price recovered

Yes it would be a terrible blow but it's possible the exchanges already have timing precautions against huge withdrawals (beyond having hot and cold wallets)
You mention they are withdrawing bitcoin, well a huge attack would hurt confidence of bitcoin lowering the value of what they stole.
To carry out this huge withdrawal attack, you would also need a very high starting amount of bitcoins to double spend with. By double spending them, you are risking your starting value of bitcoins too, not that many individuals have access to tons of coins

Why is it the core devs decision on how decentralized the network is, and when the fee market must be figured out, given that the block reward will be very substantial for 20 years going forward
It feels like the core devs won't budge at all, just flat rejection of anything above 1mb. Since that's an arbitrary number it logically follows that the core devs are arbitrarily opining it should not be raised.
If I were the core devs Id pick a bigger number that feels relatively small: even as low as 10% bigger, just to show that a hard fork could be rolled out and they are open to all ideas on how to improve scalability without being dogmatic about unmeasurable factors like decentralization. Even upping the default block size for miners would be a statement that the core devs are interested in improving things in a near term future with minimum impact

What you're talking about is not remittance, it's currency conversion
I don't think this will ever be solved because the currencies have to be balanced and the balancing has a cost
If more people used Bitcoin and it had a more relaxed legal status it would make currency conversion a bit cheaper because Bitcoin makes it possible for anyone to be a western union type operator and competition would drive the price to the bottom

Another reason they wouldn't do that is almost any store that sells anything that people actually buy is also accepting fiats, and almost all of their customers are going to be using fiats.
That's just the reality of where Bitcoin is at right now. I'm just happy if a merchant accepts bitcoin period.
The big piece I think that's missing is that vendors should always give some discount for using bitcoin. It's lower fees, it's lower risk of fraud and supporting bitcoin means promoting competition with the current few dominant payment processors which would result in lower fees in any case.

The way Bitcoin works every transaction must be published to everyone's app and verified by everyone's app and included in a verification block that only has limited space. These verification steps help ensure that no one can mess with your money or transactions
Since there is so much verification to do, sending very small amounts on the blockchain is generally discouraged, instead the idea is that you can use another network to keeps track of very small amounts and if the small amounts add up to anything serious you can send them to your own wallet through the Bitcoin network
For example if someone sends you Bitcoin like 250 bits, those are not real Bitcoin they are just credit on another network that you can put towards real Bitcoin if you want them and you have enough to not be too trivial for the network to deal with

1. Any increase in block size at all means more expensive system requirements on full nodes. There's no telling if someone will find a motivation to use up all the space in blocks for some random reason, although it's unlikely
2. If blocks have tons of supply of open tx, the fees can always be at their lowest. If blocks have low supply of open tx, people will be forced to pay more for each tx to get priority (assuming that's how that market will behave which is hard to predict)
3. Bigger blocks use more resources in relation to their size, by some unknown factor. It's not well understood yet how bigger blocks will stress things
4. The miner determines the block size because they choose which tx to include. If the cap is raised it gives them more power than they had before because they have a wider range of options. Maybe a miner figures out the other miners can't really handle big blocks so he stuffs his blocks up to the max limit. Those kind of things are not even much of an issue now because blocks are pretty small, but at 20x or 100x they could be issues
There's another factor, which is that some altcoins have tried changing this stuff and had problems. From this we can see that Bitcoin could also have problems. There aren't altcoins out there with huge blocks and that points to the fact that large blocks are not a solved problem with today's software and hardware mix

I'm just going off of what they wrote. I see what you're saying about stealing, but that kind of implies that the neighbor doesn't ask you about stealing power. If he asked and you said yes, then it would be OK right?
So if you buy a BitShare product and you know it will be using extra power, it could be OK because that's your decision. In that case, it's almost as if you are paying on installments, but without the risk of the repo man coming by and saying you're late on your payment.

The only scenario where this proposal makes sense is when a lot of work has been done to ensure that the consensus change is something that people will adopt.
You are right to say that the danger is a chain split, but that is also a danger of a miner-signaling soft-fork, which is why it is critical in a miner-signaling soft fork that people upgrade and miners do not try to signal before the network can be trusted to enforce as well.
Miner signaling is one way to help reduce risk that there will be a chain split, but it is not a guarantee and it is not the only way to reduce risk. You are also right that avoiding a chain split is one of the most important goals.

Get out the facts, and encourage everyone to do their research and really understand as much as possible.

Support the developers who are actually solving problems. Their second weapon is to twist the issues of Bitcoin against the very people working to solve them. 
Again, no coincidence these guys have done pretty much nothing and are working on nothing to advance any scalability tech or software. That they hardly even bother committing any code or any solutions period. That all they do day after day, like Gavin Andresen did today on Twitter, is to try and very aggressively and personally come after the people who are working on the solutions.

Bitcoin by itself won't bring people out of poverty, but it could help level the global financial playing ground and improve financial efficiency to have a single standardized world-wide currency.


The goal is to become a mainstream currency where you can buy everything with it. The only way to "make money off of investing" is obviously to sell later, since you are describing speculating on a rise in value. The goal of Bitcoin is not to make people money by selling later.


All currencies are bought and sold all the time, you might not realize that.


It is a currency. Whether it's better or not is a subjective value judgement, you'll have to look at its qualities and see if you like it better or not. It's worse at being controlled by your government, if you like that. If you don't like that, then it's better.

Depending on how it's implemented miners might be rewarded every time the title database is validated with a blockchain transaction. So whoever mines the block with the validating transaction would get the transaction fee.
They're kind of free-loading off of the blockchain since their validating transaction fee contributions are likely to be minimal, however in the overall sense it could be a great idea to have people valuing the blockchain, especially governments. If governments relied upon the blockchain for its timestamp utility, well they might also act in greater ways to protect the blockchain's overall health.

Nodes have a benefit model
- you get the benefit of having the most security: you can verify for yourself with the least amount of counterparty risk that transactions are valid
- you get the benefit of the most privacy: no one knows what info you are interested in since you have a complete copy and your queries are local

There's no definition for SPV which makes it tricky to talk about, in theory the SPV would be identical to a full node except it would shut down or require more verification downloading if there was a hard fork detected by a full node, at least as SPV is outlined in the white paper, but that is not implemented in any current SPV client

There was a one day discussion to move forward with miners not adopting Bitcoin Classic or similar stuff and some developers agreeing to work on and eventually deliver hard fork code.

The developers at the meeting still followed through anyway and produced some hard fork proposals and code.

It seems like the current active bitcoin devs are in favor of losing global adoption (of the blockchain itself, not of bitcoin as a community).
I think the issue is that Bitcoin is the type of project that succeeded in spite of itself. If we were debating what standard to make HTML and WWW, with people's greatest imaginings of what the web could do, people would be complaining that this HTML document format won't work when making applications.
The devs are given a very tough, maybe incorrect problem to solve: "Scale to take over from Visa/Mastercard". 
Even Bitcoin's level of traffic today would be impossible with previous generations of computers and networks. We need computers and networks capability to grow faster than the usage of bitcoin, which is impossible to predict. So the devs say, either A: well we need to offload the bitcoin work to these super nodes and keep mainline bitcoin the same, or B: well we need to make everyone into a super node and eliminate mainline bitcoin
There's no clear answer which is right, which is why there is the debate. With the web analogy, it turned out the web was good enough for desktop apps, but sucked for mobile. We can't predict the future, we can just analyze the present and make guesses.
It's pretty clear though that soon we will need super nodes. By default it looks like the super nodes will be outside of the bitcoin mainline, which is why the general community of bitcoin isn't generally in favor of that, they have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin be the end all be all. The developers don't want to mess up the dynamics of mainline bitcoin, and many of them have vested interests in the offchain supernode technology, like the guys working at blockstream

I'm no longer allowed to freely reply to your Classic announcements in Roger Ver's forum and I won't go into detail about the latest one here, but with SegWit and Bitcoin Core there is a clear pathway of tested code, and a development team that has an implementation of Schnorr and Confidential transactions.
Bitcoin Core also has clearly identified contributors, discuss things out in the open, and allow open membership, whereas you and BU derive funding from secret sources (who funds you? Seems likely to be someone who has invested very publicly in fungibility-marketed altcoins), have secret invite only forums where things are discussed, have membership agreements to become members that involve lengthy agreements to do among many other things never publish any criticism of your project.
SegWit represents a diverse open team led out of MIT DCI that wants to deploy improvements and has published code and a clear path to do so starting with SegWit. Classic and BU represent demonstrably buggy code done by isolated solo developers without review that would risk people's money should it be deployed.

The dispute people have is not with a larger block size, but with a change in consensus rules so that miners are given a role where they dictate the rules of the system. That is not desirable to anyone except maybe a miner, and even the smart miners realize that would ultimately be self-sabotage.

If you believe the government made any substantive changes to oversight and regulation of the financial industry after the financial crisis you are kidding yourself

What you aren't counting is that the U.S. government has almost no oversight over the truly risky areas of their investments: in most cases they will just move the risk taking unit to the UK or Hong Kong or somewhere with less oversight, or they will hide the risk in an unregulated hedge fund

You can see in SegWit [the version of the script]( is stored with the spend-to transaction, the version is in the byte preceding the locking script
@_date: 2017-02-01 03:40:44
It makes it so that when you spend funds, you get to specify a version of script that you want to be applied. So if you store your keys in a multisig wallet that in version 1 requires 2 keys on 2 computers, when script version 2 comes out and it only requires 1 key, a hacker no longer needs the other key to take the money.

Any block produced by a mining node that changed the blocksize would be discarded as invalid by anyone using bitcoinqt or armory etc, you probably couldn't spend it at bitpay etc, it would be as if the miner switched to mining an altcoin 
There are few mining nodes and many many full nodes
@_date: 2015-05-12 05:39:07
The issue of block size is not only bandwidth and storage, but also processing time. Each transaction has to be sent to every full node, checked by every full node, stored by every full mode.
There may be some way to fit more transactions in a block but that would only address bandwidth issues not storage and compute. 
1.5k/sec is already a pretty low target for bandwidth.

Miners and core devs don't decide that number, it requires full consent of everyone. The new coin with a different amount you could say was another coin and you could avoid it.

The white paper's SPV describes a failure mode where validation is possible after an alert, we don't have that at all. In the current SPV clients you're hardly verifying at all and could very very easily get fake Bitcoins. You have no alert when consensus rules are violated, like the white paper describes, and you have no way to do more verification after the alert, like the white paper describes. So if consensus rules are violated and you get fake Bitcoins, you won't be verifying so you won't know.
Running nodes in data centers is similarly removing the ability to verify, since how do I verify the data center? Imagine you had to leave your Bitcoin private keys with a data center. Wouldn't you think it would be reasonable if someone prefer to keep their keys themselves rather than entrust them to Google or Amazon?

Now they decided to fork this scam and make a new coin called Monero (one of many forks). They didn't make Bytecoin, or who knows because the people or person who did were all actually fake identities put up on a webpage, pretending to be real people with various accreditations.
Monero's (or should I say Bytecoin's) has a singular interesting feature: ring signatures. They are a valid premise. However equal privacy is attainable in the Bitcoin network with things like and other coinjoin implementations, making that premise pretty weak, especially when you consider that the blockchain used properly is most often not the weakest link in the privacy chain.

Of course people could share access to the keys, but you can at least see the source: you gave the garage key to the maids wallet and someone with that key just opened the garage door with it. Make them give it back after, basically just a decentralized database.
- auctions would be good for colored coins but you still need trust because real things live in the real world and can just ignore the virtual abstraction
- movie theater tickets we have already with fandango, but Bitcoin could transform "opening day" experience, or seat choosing experience by creating markets for tickets/seats. It could even change the way movies are funded, imagine people pre-buying great seats to the next Christopher Nolan film as speculation they will be able to flip them, and Nolan uses that money to kickstart/finance the film

1. Agree on a time and place - it should be a public place so you and the buyer are more protected if something goes wrong 
2. Deposit the coins with lbc and fund the transaction

Bitcoin is about freedom, the core idea is that there is no counter party risk: no risk some other person or entity will take or change your money or influence your transactions

Miners sometimes do this as a calculated risk, they leave the tx fees on the table because it's a bit faster to send smaller blocks and a bit faster to avoid checking the transactions
Remember mining is a race to who can get the block the fastest, in this race seconds can make the difference between a block reward and nothing
There are some measures to discourage this: having a small block limit so the amount of time spent verifying and distributing is very limited, having a large time window between blocks so the advantage of a few seconds is unlikely to make a difference, plus some other stuff along those lines

Then I agree with you, only a crisis can cause a PoW change. If we can trivially change the PoW, we can trivially change the coin limit and many other very important constants.
However, miners attacking the network to a sufficient degree would certainly represent a crisis. We do not currently meet the definition of a crisis and are far from it. It would be extremely difficult to create such a crisis because Bitcoin is quite hardened against attack. and some miners are threatening to create a crisis, but so far they seem to be limited to just that: threats.

Bitcoin is not "deflationary", because it is not removing anything from the supply, it's just limited. USD cash is inflationary because of a tax the government implements called "printing money". Today's dollars are not 1990 dollars, who pocketed the difference? The Government - it's a hidden tax that actually impacts the poor and middle class the most since they are the least likely to be able to protect their assets from inflation in bonds and stocks

Yes, I don't want to imply that you don't need nodes. You need the network to agree to this, and the miner signaling method is a faster way to achieve that agreement. But even that is not bullet proof. We've already had the hard fork you describe, six blocks long, because miners aren't being honest with their signaling. 
So if miners aren't being honest and not speeding up activation, it may no longer make sense to use that method for soft forks and switch to another method where we try and get this broad network support.

Invalid blocks are not orphans, they are invalid. If a miner tried to print a million coins for himself, it wouldn't be orphaned or made stale, it would be rejected as invalid.
Orphaning is normal, nodes accept blocks that will be orphaned or are already orphaned all the time. Invalid blocks are not normal, they are considered an attack, and nodes that are relayed invalid blocks will immediately disconnect and ban peers that try to relay them.

I don't use blockchain wallet myself, but how it would work is that you would setup an advanced send where you send coins to a new address you control, and you spend the unconfirmed change from the previous transaction with a high fee. The miners will see a high fee chain of transactions and put it in a block.

You're stuck on this idea that miners have this power to change what a full node thinks is a valid block. They don't have that power, a miner with any amount of hashing power cannot make my node accept a block larger than 1 mb any more than they can make my client accept dogecoins

Changing the mining algorithm is a last resort, but possible. Let's imagine that someone found a break in SHA256. We'd have no choice but to change, the algorithm would not work. Other hash algorithms have broken to various degrees before: SHA1, MD5, so it's quite conceivable.
Miners attacking the network, it's a similar situation. They'd have to be extremely blatant about it to reach the same level of agreement that breaking the hash function would likely grant. The same state level actors you're talking about could easily approach a few mining pool operators and demand they take certain actions. And we might have no way of knowing that. 
Essentially, it is not easy. If it is an obvious solution, nothing special really stops it. Other coins have changed important consensus rules before, it's hard but quite doable.

Soft forks that get adopted don't require a majority of miners to enforce constraints, the network itself enforces the constraints. If a miner does not enforce the constraints they just produce an invalid block and the nodes do not accept it as Bitcoin, no matter how much hash power it has.
SegWit doubles the block size and fixes critical bugs in Bitcoin. Your "anyonecanspend" line is meaningless, misleading, false, misinformation. The network enforces the constraints.

There are lots of big problems and although solutions are being worked on it doesn't mean they will work or even come to fruition
There are lots of promising open platforms that failed to succeed as people wanted because of practical deficiencies that could have been theoretically overcome but never were, or closed systems used the efficiencies of being closed to their advantage
Open doesn't always win. Freedom doesn't always win. That's the sad truth, people care more about practical benefits more than ethical frameworks
Of course ethics aren't completely removed from practicality. Why did women get the right to work? Practical reality of needing to outproduce other countries. Why does it cost $0.03 to send a Bitcoin across the world and $45.00 for a wire transfer? A corrupt financial system.

It depends on two factors:
1. Your risk tolerance
2. The risk tolerance of others
You should realize that using LN is not quite as safe as Bitcoin and only use it for spending money.
If everyone does this, it will also mean that LN cannot move large sums since LN can only move money in proportion to how much others are keeping in their LN wallets.
You'll still probably be able to use a LN wallet for both, and the LN wallet will hide these details from you, just like Bitcoin wallets hide many other details.

There are multiple arguments against larger sized blocks
1. Theoretically we are making it more difficult to host a full node due to bandwidth and space and processing requirements.
2. In 100 years we won't have block rewards. At that point fees will be needed to pay for the network security. But if the fees are still very low because there is tons of space in a block, the security will then also be low in theory
3. We don't know how rough the big blocks will be on the network/nodes. They could require 20x more cpu and ram and disk, or it could be a lot more or less, there isn't comprehensive testing on that yet
4. Leaning on Bitcoin as a processing network could be retarding growth in 2nd phase layers like lightning network and sidechains. These technologies could replace bitcoins usage as a payment network and allow for instant secure transfers, unlimited scalability, all while keeping Bitcoin as a secure foundation underneath
5. Raising the block cap really gives the power to the miners since they can set the block size to whatever they want under the cap. Miners having outsize power to influence the network is against the decentralization design goals of Bitcoin

That's incorrect, arbitrary changes are defended against by the consensus rules that a full node verifies. You can read about it in the white paper:


About invalid blocks?


It's quite theoretically possible, and in fact it has even happened on numerous occasions. In the summer of 2015 on two separate occasions, with up to six invalid blocks and even very recently with the Bitcoin Unlimited consensus failure bug.


What you describe is not applicable to broad swathes of the economy. No thin wallets would be impacted. Merchants already use full nodes. Most SPV wallets use trusted channels in addition that would not be impacted. No custodial wallets would be impacted. Most users of SPV only use them to spend or to receive from trusted sources, neither of which would be impacted.


It has indeed happened but is not nearly the limit to what a miner could do to you if you are not validating at all. If validation were not present, miners could create value out of thin air, they could take money that did not belong to them.

No, that would be in the established rule set and acceptable to node logic, although undesirable. Hard forks are totally unacceptable to node validation logic, that's their definition
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:04:33


Bitcoins are virtual coins that are limited in number like gold coins are.


When you run a full node like Bitcoin Core, it checks that the inflation matches what it expects, and if the inflation is different it doesn't show you have received any bitcoins. That makes it so no one can try to inflate the coins beyond what people expect because they won't accept that.

Not only does he claim that, when the bug happened he actually went to the other miners and told them that they needed to switch to Unlimited in order to avoid forking the network.

There's no central definition of what is valid - every node can have its own definition. That's because Bitcoin is designed as a peer to peer decentralized network with no authority. Your node sees it as valid and thus it is valid. Another node seeing a transaction as invalid has no bearing on the situation, other than to suggest to you that you might want to opt in to their ruleset.

Lightning nodes bundle transactions and settle periodically with the blockchain in a low trust way. It still uses Bitcoin script features to ensure the nodes can't steal the funds and the nodes are still decentralized. I'm not sure what the incentive model is for lightning though, other than enabling lower fees and faster sends
Basically imagine if bitpay and Coinbase who have tons of traffic between them could only periodically settle up, like once a day vs every transaction. This would reduce fees, increase speed, lower blockchain bloat but with the disadvantage of bitpay and Coinbase needing to trust each other. Lightning is kind of that idea generalized and hopefully standardized. Right now it's just an idea though.

This will be an interesting test of the Bitcoin experiment. Bitcoin works because miners are kept in check by full nodes and the value of the block rewards and fees. Changing the fundamental rules of the system is designed to be hard because you have to get everyone to switch to the new system, impossible to defend against people downloading new software in any system
Gavin has discovered a vulnerability in the security of Bitcoin: you can avoid asking SPV clients if they want to switch by appearing backwards compatible, even when you aren't. This is how he is designing his hard fork, to trick SPV clients into thinking nothing fundamental has changed, in order to avoid having to ask the end users if they want to opt in to a rule change. The scary part of this security hole he is exploiting is that if this can be exploited again it can change the coin limit from 21 million to something higher, which would devalue all of people's money.
Hopefully this attack does not succeed and we can adjust and try to fix this security issue

Like with that there are some mixing scenarios, maybe you don't want to go to 4MB on the old style TX side but you do want to allow them to potentially reach 4MB on the segwit side. I'm still thinking it through: the one nice thing about a hard fork is anything that can logically happen is possible.

Second layer networks, and a bigger block size through SegWit and more efficient transactions through BLS and MAST tech?
People don't just magically pay more and more fees forever and ever, that's a tragically naive way of thinking about a market. People get more efficient with their use of a limited resource. 
The more you increase the on-chain transaction load, the more you hurt the decentralization of the network. It's a careful balance to sustain the fundamental properties of the network that people are trying very hard to sabotage and destroy

1. We could fork to add more divisibility but it would require a new transaction serialization format.
2. We could start making a new type of transaction that used provable probability to model small differences in amounts. So instead of me paying you $0.01 I would give you a provable 1 in 100 shot at $1
I feel like you could formulate a soft fork to add more divisibility by showing the legacy clients a version of history with different values, but I haven't seen anyone think it through

That is a valid attack, and even some people right now who want to stop the Bitcoin blockchain to force a change to consensus rules like and the Bitcoin Unlimited team has proposed spending tens of millions of dollars to do what you propose so that people have no choice but to abandon the blockchain.
In the short run, we could wait an attack out and then just start up again when the attack was over.
Another potential way to deal with this would be to develop alternatives to the PoW method of timestamping such as proof of time/wait, proof of space, or web of trust limited solutions. Another strategy would be to encourage solutions for governments where they build important services on top of the Blockchain, giving governments a motivation to step up to protect the Blockchain should it come under attack.

Majority of "nodes" is totally meaningless because fake nodes cost nothing and majority of miners can just refer to a single dominant ASIC manufacturer. So this definition means: "Whatever the ASIC manufacturer wants"

This isn't the right way, it's overly complicated and annoying, this info is out of date
The best way now to securely store a "wallet" of bitcoins is:
1. Use a HD seed not a "paper wallet". This is easy already because Armory, Electrum, pretty much every wallet since Multibit supports seed wallets
2. Use a multisig setup. This isn't as easy but there are some limited hand holding options: green address (you can use this with Trezor too) and electrum both have multisig wizards
Why are these ways the best?
- with a paper wallet you probably have to deal with the bad practice of reusing or consolidating your Bitcoin into paper keys or the annoyance and possible misplacing of many pieces of paper
- with a single sig wallet you are at the mercy of the device where you spend it. With multisig: n devices must be simultaneously compromised, n times more unlikely
- with a paper wallet it requires printing, time consuming and potentially insecure because printers cache their output or could even be compromised over the network theoretically.
- with multisig there isn't a need to setup a clean room environment for your coins, which can go wrong or be time consuming and annoying to do 
Another tool I think is helpful is if you have an iPhone or iPad which has strong sandboxing between apps if you haven't rooted it. I wouldn't keep savings bitcoins there, but it can be great for a small hot wallet
Also blockchain technically says they don't keep your private keys, but they are still a bad service
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:44:17
Fair enough, I'd never use or recommend mycelium because of the centralized server system but other than that issue I think it can be a great wallet
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:01:34
Try electrum software wallet or armory
Breadwallet or mycelium are also OK
Blockchain.info has serious problems
1. They've had super serious security problems in the past, like letting anyone download wallets just by guessing the identifiers, or screwing up their random number generation to let people guess private keys
2. They promote address reuse which goes against best practices designed to help individual users and the entire network
3. They have problems parsing the blockchain sometimes and go offline, out of sync or start missing blocks, parsing transactions poorly
4. They have an adversarial relationship with Bitcoin core devs, when core devs reach out to them they don't respond or take their advice
5. Their core security model is suspect since it's extremely easy for them to slip you some bad code without you noticing. Also the local encryption they use for the wallet is pretty weak since they use weak key stretching and don't enforce strong pass phrases

This is a feature. People are allowed to not use it if they have objections to it. Hard forks force people to change, soft forks open a possibility to change. People say it won't change quickly because fees are very low (pennies) and not a real problem for anyone since they've been near this rate for years


Even a single block can take an hour to appear due to random variance. You should expect to wait hours for a confirm even when blocks are empty, that's how Satoshi designed it


Nope: 0.12 now has mempool limiting. I limited mine to 50mb, no issues.


There is now RBF that will allow you to guarantee a transaction will go through. Of course no one who uses a proper fee has to worry about this problem, and the fee is currently ten times smaller than what you describe


Yeah by the people who want bigger blocks, or prompted by them. Gavin said Bitcoin would fail in four years, Mike said it failed right now, actual bitcoiners have seen it all before and know it will not fail just because fees rose a few pennies and some crybabies made a big fuss about it


I knew people who worked there. And what they told me is that management fucked over the engineering team with user focused goals. These goals were not achievable on their software stack but management didn't listen. So query times went through the moon and the engineers quit.

I'm happy to pay them, because I'm contributing to the security of the system, which is the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin. When you pay higher fees, you are making it harder to attack Bitcoin.
It's also good to see that what we once thought of as a theoretical solution for long term security that people used to wring their hands about is actually a practical solution: fees can pay for the security of the network.
We have proven that we do not need the crutch of the miner subsidy. Just using fees as a subsidy, we now are just about at the level of total miner revenue that we were at just before the 2013 price run up to $1240.
I also like that fees motivate other healthy choices for the network, like gently discouraging people from polluting the Blockchain with random garbage that increases my costs to run a node and doesn't contribute to the mission of Bitcoin, such as sending 1 satoshi payments to people with advertising messages attached on blockchain.info.

@_date: 2017-02-26 06:23:11
The work isn't processing transactions, it's just timestamping, but otherwise you're right. The network nodes enforcing the protocol rules prevents miners from attempting creating invalid blocks that steal money or break other rules of the system. 
They aren't stopped from invalid blocks because miners are good people, they are stopped from invalid blocks because those blocks will fail validation from the full nodes.

Bitcoin has a volatile market value, this can only be solved by having a very large market
Bitcoins are only usable online, the only solution for this is some kind of offline trust model that doesn't exist yet
Bitcoins are easily stolen if stored in a naive way. This can only be solved by best security practices being generally agreed upon and that knowledge being presented in a way people can understand very easily
Bitcoin mining is wasteful of resources since disproportionate amount of hash power and bitcoins are being used to secure the network. There was no way to foresee that this would be the case when creating Bitcoin and it is too late to change now, however with reward halving the problem will go away
Bitcoins are not designed for very small micro transactions that amount to generic database entries. This can be solved by off chain services like changetip or by the upcoming sidechains feature that will allow 1:1 pegging of "altcoin" value

What would probably be best would be hardware wallets that have a maximum output per day as a logical firewall against loss
They should then have a person sanity check everything when switching hardware wallet boxes out, and the private keys of the hot wallet are never connected to the Internet
Deposit addresses seem to have been compromised so that probably indicates whatever stored those addresses was compromised. To solve that, every deposit address should have been a fresh address generated from a hardware wallet
Tldr: hardware wallets with fixed and limited capabilities and communication

I don't think this is true, because people have shown they will whine about any trivial amount, no matter how small
If blocks were 2MB, fees would trend to $0.025. Someone would repeat the same attack, paying half as much per spam, and fees would go to $0.05 and then we'd hear about the tribes in the Amazon who never saw a penny in their life and how racist we are that we are excluding them from Bitcoin, and would demand we increase to 4MB. Then people would get used to $0.01 fees, and we would repeat the same process, until the doubling consumed all the worlds energy and humanity became extinct

Running your own node is the only way to use Bitcoin without trusting a 3rd party middleman, and the only way to use it privately without revealing your addresses to other people. If people who cannot pay $0.05 don't mind trusting a 3rd party middleman and revealing their private information, they can just use a centralized system where Bitcoins are used as the unit of account and the 3rd party middleman just uses a cheap database to keep track of trades.

Coinbase is pretty close to perfect consumer play, but they keep screwing around with Bitcoin enthusiast stuff when no real Bitcoin fan would keep their coins with Coinbase
For the regular consumer class they don't need electrum or paper wallets etc. They just need an easy way to spend and send money that offers some benefit over the current system
Coinbase has most of what it needs "Bitcoin accepted here" on major online stores. Easy fiat transfer after verification. Easy spending buttons. But what they are missing is a "buy through" system where you never even sit in bitcoins. Bitcoin enthusiasts buy back anyway, and regular consumers won't need to take any risk. 
Then you truly get the best of both worlds, a free and open system where you can hold coins only if you want, anyone can start a Coinbase competitor, and if you are an enthusiast just keep spending from electrum or armory

Normally this happens when there is a fast block, in what is called "validationless" or "spy" mining. 750k is fairly normal, that's still the default recommended value for block size set by Bitcoin Core. 100k on the other hand is unusually low, especially when the missed out on fees are high and the small blocks are not fast at all.

The Vpn sees your ip which can be related back to you 
3 - Blockchain.info wallet
Can use fingerprinting and ip logging to trace you
2 - Cash via mail
Your correspondence with the seller could generate language that could be analyzed and matched
Your mail could be determined to have a rough origin, or maybe even a specific origin depending on how you sent it
Your cash or envelope could have DNA or serial numbers that were tracked.

Sorry you are saying things that are factually incorrect. Either on purpose or giving you the benefit of the doubt, you are just ignorant of the facts.
A. The initial backers cashed out at 1000
In fact only a very small percentage of coins were sold at $1000 - your statement is false. In fact the creator of Bitcoin, who has the largest share of it, hasn't sold his coins.
B. Bitcoins ability to be close to foolproof would become apparent
There have been very big improvements in easy security. Coinbase, Trezor, HD wallets. 
Your statement that easy security should be here by now is false because there is no factual basis why it should be here now. Many technologies have taken decades to become suitable for a mass market, and some that never do still find a use even without having mass market appeal.
C. Wealth decreasing
People who thought Bitcoin offered a way to have wealth go up every day on their computer screens were scammed. That is not what Bitcoin offers, and some people pitched it that way were scamming, but they were wrong to do so. Bitcoin developers or reputable parties didn't make this claim
Obviously Bitcoin can't go down every day, that's just basic math, it's factually wrong to say it will go down every day. It will go up and down, it might go down a little bit for a long time or a lot for a short time, but it can't always go down.

the intent of BU is only fork if miners AND full nodes are in consensus.
There's no way to reliably measure full nodes, fake nodes are trivial. BU also has no code or statement that backs up your assertion that they care about the SegWit node count.


It's in the code directly, not github.


Lol, if you guys try to fork to an altcoin with an insecure POW without asics you deserve to be attacked,
If you accept that miners control the consensus rules and desire that people are coerced to use it instead of voluntarily choose it, that is not Bitcoin.

Changetip is not Bitcoin, it's just an application that uses Bitcoin, and in a limited way: interactions on Changetip are not part of the Bitcoin blockchain and it's very conceivable in the future that Changetip would switch to using dollars or add more support for them, hardly anything about their service need change.
Users accepting tips on changetip don't even truly own bitcoin, they just own a theoretical debt from Changetip denominated in Bitcoin. In the near future I also expect that changetip will allow you to redeem this debt for gift cards or USD, so that a changetip user never even interacts with Bitcoin at all

You must have gotten a bad Electrum server that allowed you to send a zero fee, many will bounce your transaction and refuse to broadcast it if its fee is very low
You should make sure to update to the newest version of Electrum and check that the preference for dynamic fees and RBF are switched on.
If you had switched RBF on, you would be able to simply right click the transaction to increase its fee with a slider

Another strategy could be restoring the wallet from seed - since zero fee transactions propagate so poorly the Electrum server he would connect to would probably not even know about the old transaction

When double spends happen it's actually because there are two versions of history, not that something was actually spent twice. After a while only one version of history will win out, what's why you wait for confirmations so one history becomes real and the other histories are ignored
A double spend attack only works if you can convince someone to give you something in exchange for a recent history spend or you have massive mining power and can manipulate the history as you see fit

Bitcoin is a small currency and volatile so if you're talking about denominating debt, it's not a great tool for that due to its small size
Other small currencies like the Polish zlotys use other stable pegs to get around their volatility: Polish people pay their mortgages in debt valued by Swiss francs. That case also goes to show that inflation and deflation are real risks in any debt, since the Swiss francs just increased in value by 15% after they uncoupled with the a Euro
Debt is just a contract between you and the other person, Bitcoin doesn't need to provide anything for that, it's just a way to make the transfer. You can denominate your debt in Big Mac Hamburger price equivalents if you want

Logically speaking it's always a good idea to keep your sensitive data air gapped. If they aren't connected to the Internet, how can they be compromised remotely?
Practically speaking you have to come up with the best security that works for you. Bitcoin has a lot of security options: keep coins on paper only, on a hardware device, on an air gapped laptop, on a clean laptop, on your phone, on your computer, on a JavaScript wallet, on a hosted service
The farther away from a hosted service the more control you have over security, however you have to balance this against your personal skill and motivation level of keeping your coins safe and not lost

It would have to be decided in court, but the loophole they could use is that Bitcoin has no legal definition so they take your Bitcoins and credit you with CoinbaseCoins but they call their CoinbaseCoins Bitcoins. To help CoinbaseCoins take over the market, they give away your Bitcoins randomly, helping to crash the price of Bitcoin. They have already done this one time, with another coin.
I also advise you to be very wary of information about Bitcoin, because there are saboteurs out there like who are trying to assist in thefts of coin and schemes like this CoinbaseCoin, they are quite subtle about it but they spread credible-sounding misinformation endlessly, like it's their job. Verify information yourself and be careful about security.

Spam = abusing a shared resource for personal gain at a cost to others. People asked you nicely to make simple improvements that would reduce the burden to the network, you refused. Your refusals kept the prices of early transactions and syncing the Blockchain costs higher than they otherwise would have been, had you been a good citizen of the network and cooperated with others to make the network more efficient. 
Similar to how when you helped sell Josh Garza's PayCoin you helped to perpetuate the idea that Bitcoin is about scams, which holds back Bitcoin even further.
SegWit capacity increase depends on the future transaction types, which is not precisely predictable, it could be as high as 4x even. 2x is an estimate, when you quibble over 200kb it reveals the weakness of your position: 200kb is not going to make a meaningful impact regarding scalability of the system
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:57:03
Unfortunately for the hucksters who want to build Blockchain buzzword bingo businesses, Bitcoin as a currency is integral to making smart contracts of any kind possible. One reason why is that with fiat or any other violence backed property, you always can step outside of the system to settle by force. For example if you are trading houses on a real estate block chain, when you go to claim your house and the guy doesn't leave, your token proves meaningless and you have to appeal to the government. So why didn't you just use a simple database run by them in the first place if you had to trust them anyway? 
So in my view "Blockchain technology" will not go anywhere

There's no reason that's true. If people don't want to pay miners, they won't. That can easily happen without any constraints, people may just not want to buy what the miners are selling.


It wouldn't act like a monopoly because off-chain transactions still compete.

Nothing you list as broken was ever "working"; the market was always volatile and the limitations always existed, if anything they have gotten better over time
For Bitcoin to grow organically a lot of the people who didn't really understand what they were buying into need to leave and let informed people take their coins
The reason people should be interested in Bitcoin is for the decentralization feature, that's really the only winning feature of Bitcoin. That feature still remains despite all the false claims of centralized mining. 
If you want micropayments for everything or Bitcoin to solve every financial woe or to fix onerous government regulations, you need to forget Bitcoin it is not going to do that.

It's small because the Bitcoin network won't allow double spends even before it gets to the confirmations step, nodes will throw out attempts to do so
If your transaction is already on tons of nodes it's a good bet it's not a double spend. It's not 100% solid but double spends are so incredibly rare that merchants shouldn't worry about it

LN uses short term fund locks, which is different from other solutions because it is more censorship resistant and secure. 
Using staked super nodes isn't good because you can identify them and stop them. LN nodes can appear with any amount of coins and with a very low overhead: they can be run out of a basement with limited bandwidth. And for security they have the full security of the Bitcoin Blockchain

From what I've read it sounds like Bytecoin had a good idea, ring signatures to improve privacy. They leveraged this sliver of credibility into creating a massive premine, and some forks of their own. Monero was one of the early forks, although potentially by different devs.
It also sounds like the Bitcoin core devs amongst others have reviewed the use of ring signatures as being a good idea, and marked it as a potential upgrade to Bitcoin. 
The thing is, what is your motivation for making yet another new coin when you could work helping them add ring signatures to Bitcoin or planning a sidechain (if that ever comes about)? I think I can guess what the motivation is

Some people have the idea that we shouldn't decide where the middle lives, but I don't see any reason why we shouldn't decide that, that's the flawed assumption: we should be deciding this, we are part of the system, this is a man made system and we designed it to serve ourselves.

Here's what pump and dump means: pump means a marketing and sales push to increase the price and dump means a sell off before stopping the marketing and sales push that will lower demand
After a while, marketing and sales pushes won't be as effective. It's already pretty much the case that just "news" will not move the Bitcoin market price
Bitcoin will always be volatile while it remains at a low market cap. Even the massive USD has in the past dropped 15% in a year vs the Euro, and generally the smaller a currency is, the more widely its price will vary.

This might be a good point, maybe miners are also incentivized to keep the block limit lowered to stop their competitors from including too many transactions. So if they include more transactions they actually do have a downside of lowering overall fee pressure. 
However then it's just guesswork if you're actually making blocks respond to fee pressure in the way you might hope: maybe the power to restrict block sizes from increasing will mean miners will decide to start putting in place a more strict soft limit to keep the fee pressure high. Maybe that pressure isn't really enough and it doesn't act as much of a downside at all. It's hard to predict a market.
Re the idea of making a punishment for miners voting for a block size increase, I do like the idea of miners having to pay for block size increases. I favor something like a reward deferment. This would mean miners could start saying "we give up some block reward in favor of more transaction fees". The block rewards would then move to a much later point in Bitcoin's future and the miner would get to gobble up tons of transaction fees instead.

This graph is also interesting
It shows we are having 54,000 transactions / day that are in very long chains, longer than 10,000 transactions long. That means that these coins (making up 25% of all daily transactions) were traded on average more than 4 times a day, every single day, since the start of Bitcoin. Seems like a strange pattern.

It works the other way. The greedy people see the rise and they sell. They sell to some other greedy people who want it to rise more but they also sell it to some hodlrs who will never ever sell, like me
Because Bitcoin is limited supply, this percentage going to hodlrs eventually eats and eats away at the total supply, until hodlrs have all the coins. Then there are no more coins left to buy. When that occurs, we are at the moon.

Looks like it should confirm to me.
As a reference, in the past 24 hours 35,000 transactions like it were confirmed. 78,000 transactions with fees lower than this were also confirmed. And about 163,000 transactions with higher fees were confirmed. So although this is a fee on the lower side of things (2.6 cents), it is still acceptable to the network. 
Your App should be adjusted to allow you to select a higher fee (maximum of 5.8 cents) if you desired a faster transaction. It does sound like a problem that should be solved

I don't like the idea of a flag day by itself if it means u/nullc says "Ok enough is enough, next month we will switch to SegWit". That pushes in the direction of mandatory or automatic upgrades.
However the opposite is also true, if Jihan Wu decides we should not have SegWit, we have created a gating factor in progress. Why do we even want this gating factor? The reason is that to deploy a soft fork you want to avoid splitting the network by making sure that everyone is on the same chain. The miners have tools to do that more quickly and easily, so if it helps the speed of deployment we should use the miners.
But what if the miners actually slow things down? Then we have a situation where we gain very little with signaling driven activation. So actually I don't see this as an either or proposition. The next SegWit version, should this one not activate, can contain both a flag day and a quicker activation path that is triggered through signaling.

In theory bitcoins will neither deflate nor inflate. 
If I told you your dollar would be worth $0.50 in a year you would leave dollars and others would do so too, until the value today was already $0.50 (because what do you have to lose then)
If I told you your dollar would be worth $2 in a year you would leave your other assets that don't double and put your money in dollars until the value was already $2 today
So if Bitcoin will be deflating in the future, that's a self defeating idea since people will realize the deflated price today, until there is no more "gain" to be had. It might inflate some as people use other stores of wealth, it might deflate some as more people use it for unpredictable reasons, but all things being equal it will stay the same value since it by itself is predictable

Unfortunately there is currently no exchange that also provides a secure wallet, so you need multiple Apps
When you are done trading, send the coins to your personal wallet. Your personal wallet will have a "receive" function that will give you a 1 time address that you can use to send to from your exchange account
As far as financial gain goes, in theory it's never too early or too late, because the market is pricing in all the factors we know about. Similar to a precious metal purchase, the value may fluctuate wildly, and nothing is being produced by your investment, you are simply speculating on the idea that demand for Bitcoin will maintain into the future at an expected or better than expected rate.

Currently the number of transactions per second is within an acceptable range, 99.9% of the time if you include the recommended fee your transaction will be included in the next block
There are many more ways to enable more transactions per second than just adjusting the block size, but this is one of the more simple and obvious ways to do it. More core devs would be good, but currently the core devs are ahead of real world usage, uptake on Bitcoin has been slow enough that it doesn't matter the core dev progress is also slow. 
The idea of raising the block size limit is:
1. It was a temporary solution that is no longer needed (it wasn't present in the original bitcoin network)
2. In a couple years if growth continues as it has been, people will have to wait longer for confirmations, which could be annoying
3. Bumping up the cap is a simple improvement that should have minimal and obvious repercussions

You can't transmit electricity but you can transmit information with the Bitcoin network in a very secure and permanent way that doesn't have as much risk as other methods

Economics doesn't predict exactly what will happen, there are too many variables. Economics can provide for guiding principles but not concrete predictions.
Even so, what doesn't include are incredibly important variables:
1. Miners have to fear off-chain and altcoins and sidechains and fiat competition (plus mining rewards being less valuable), which pushes them to keep the fees low. Basic economics: there are always alternatives.
2. If 5 miners agree to work together: if you are the 5th miner you really have no good reason not to betray the other miners and take more profits by accepting lower fee transactions, especially if you know you will not have the full mining power forever. Not to mention mining pool operators don't actually "control" 100% of their hash power, other hash power might go to the non-cartel member to make more money and to help the network.
How I want the fee system to work is: block space is only limited by one precept: keeping the network decentralized. What that means exactly is that block space cannot be abused to promote more mining centralization and block space is still easily sync-able by a regular user running a regular full node.
It scares the shit out of me when calls running a full node a fetish and that there should only be 12 nodes - that means no privacy (only full nodes do not compromise your privacy) and no checks on miner's power (SPV nodes trust anything that miners create, just as long as it's the longest chain).  - I'm just glad he can't force me to change my node to a centralized, bastardized version of Bitcoin

I'm not a core dev, but I can take a stab at it and I'm sure people will love to say if I'm wrong.
The issue is that when a miner finds a block, their job is not quite finished, they have to include transactions and then push their block around the world to all the other miners, so that the next block will build on their block, it's a chain you see.
Including transactions isn't so hard, it can be done in parallel, so by the time the finding is done they have all the transactions ready to go. Of course sometimes they aren't ready to go and they will just skip that step and include no transactions (you will see empty blocks on the blockchain sometimes)
The pushing the block part around the world is the tricky one because it has to be pushed super fast. If it's at all slow, then there's possibly two blocks going at similar times around, and you will see something like you had a confirmation, but then you lost it. The network is not designed for this kind of thing, it wastes energy, it's confusing, it can create big rewrites of history, that's part of why we wait ten minutes for a confirmation, so hopefully people finding blocks at the same time is kept to an absolute minimum.
Over time this has continued to be a problem as blocks grew, but core devs addressed it in various ways so no one noticed. It's often the case that when a good dev is doing his job right, you never even noticed he did anything, he kept things working. Right now it's a bit hacky what solutions they used, and so they don't want to keep building on those.
For Segwit there is a new solution proposed, an optimization to improve the pushing the block time by a lot. They think it's safe up to 4mb, maybe a bit more. If there's a hard fork, Segwit has to be delayed because what was safe at 4mb is not safe at 8mb. The danger is not the destruction of the network, but a big decrease in the reliability of a confirmation as well as opening up other theoretical attacks and problems that could increase mining centralization or open the door to new DOS attack types like deliberately super slow to verify transactions.

Virtually no one is storing random things in the blockchain, the download is the entire history of all transactions so it is big. To solve this you can use an SPV light client today, and devs are working on pruning algorithms that will make it so that you only need to store the relevant data not every random thing
Storage space is also getting cheaper, so that's another way it will be solved.

Incorrect, the highest fees went through at the same speed they always had. Only the low end of the fees took longer. This is the appropriate response to a network flood, triage important transactions 


That's one melodramatic way to put it. Another way is, "people were mildly inconvenienced by having to pay a few cents more in fees, the same as they were in all the previous spam attacks"


There's never room for dust transactions. Many low fee transactions were in fact processed. There is much evidence of a widespread attack, even from mining pools such as Bitfury. Also the fact that it started suddenly, consisted of many many low fee transactions, and then stopped suddenly, also is evidence of the attack. 


How does he know that "most of the transaction volume was from wallets to exchanges". Any proof? Isn't that such a ridiculous claim to make with no evidence? Hello? 


Transactions that pay fees are acceptable. Miners decide what is acceptable. Developers publish code that other people can choose to use if they want, that's it.


Satoshi's lite client was never realized. It was specified to include protections against miners breaking the rules. Today's light clients have no such protections


Actually the only consensus that actually has consensus is the consensus of Bitcoin Core. The other consensus has a bunch of AWS sock puppets and a tiny minority of blocks from a single mining farm operated by one company.


Peer to Peer means individuals can participate, not that all the regular users are forced off the network by gigabyte blocks


Implementing new rules, through inaction? Step back a minute, does that even parse as a sentence? What kind of contorted logic have they come to? And SegWit doubles capacity, it is not inaction


Anyone's free to make an altcoin, I don't think that is contested


That's a nice way to describe the guy who demanded of Satoshi he be made project organizer and then probably scared off Satoshi by going to the CIA. A guy who isn't a cryptographer by his own admission and hasn't written any meaningful code for the project in years, and doesn't even intend to for Classic
Don't forget blockchaininfo are the ones who: lost customer funds by using random numbers from a third party website. Who encouraged address reuse, hurting the entire network's privacy. Who don't verify transactions, allowing someone to spoof a transaction from Satoshi. Who allowed anyone to download a persons wallet if they knew their username. Who created a shared send system that charged a high fee to anonymize transactions but that system in fact did nothing but offer fake privacy that was easily reversed. Who failed to keep their open source repository up to date with their actual code but claimed open source. Who give fake priority information on their transaction pages. Who used http instead of https in many wallet situations and did have mitm attacks steal funds from customers. Who used only ten rounds of pbkdf key stretching when the recommended is thousands at least.

I don't like the idea of signing over my decisions to a "representative". That's not what Bitcoin is about for me
Here's how it should work: instead of representatives for decision making, we should have representatives for explaining. These people should present their analysis, and be given attention based on their relative expertise. Any complex subject can be explained if you are willing to spend time listening to an expert 
Maybe explanations, being secondary sources, are suspect. So we should definitely listen to critique of these explanations, and try to get multiple independent explanations to find the unbiased truth.
Nowhere in this process should there be signing decision making over to people because of some thing they did in the past. Past actions should establish expertise, but not authority

Basically when you send a transaction it's given an ID number. But there's a bug in Bitcoin where the ID number can be changed by someone else, which is super annoying, it makes it hard to keep track of where money is being sent. SegWit fixes this bug.
As another benefit, SegWit introduces a new system for syncing the Blockchain that allows for twice as many transactions per second to go on the Blockchain. That would reduce fees by at least 2x, which could be pretty nice.

First, you can help prevent replay attacks by letting everyone you know that Bitcoin Unlimited is dangerous because people can be hit with this kind of loss and they may have no recourse.

I'm not selling an altcoin... that is you. Now you're back on the attack the critics theme. I showed you the impression that was generated, and you dove into semantics. A con man often doesn't tell an outright lie, he just leads his rubes to form their own false impressions. Of course when it's a simple product, this can be ascribed to simple marketing, when it's a bet or an investment, that's when it crosses the line. I think that's a pretty simple concept.


Now you are lying about who brought up the liar theme :)


But the ledger is not immutable. And it's only resistant to mutation of the actual purpose: creating a p2p currency. It's not resistant to mutation of its secondary invented purposes: such as storing irrelevant Factom data. No one is promising you that your Factom data will survive to the next version.


I'm against profits when they are paired with misleading information. I only favor profits when both sides of the deal are indeed better off in a fair and equitable trade. That can only happen when the terms of the deal are represented honestly. I'm against anyone who tries to sell Bitcoins as "immutable" for example.

There can be multiple reasons, but one reason is that there was not enough time to validate the transactions before the block solution was found.
Each miner is running two processes in parallel:
1. Find the block solution
2. Validate and prepare the transactions for the block
If the block solution is found first, the validation and preparation step is skipped: no point in risking 25 BTC block reward for 0.5 BTC in fees

There is no compromise between food and poison but death. Poison is offered, **the stated objective is to destroy Core**, there is no possibility Core can compromise with this demand and still exist.


If they actually wanted that, **they would support SegWit** and Layer 2 solutions in addition to their harebrained schemes of an unlimited blocksize, but they demonstrably do not support those.

Tumbled coins through something like CoinJoin are impossible to track A to B to C and are completely anonymous
1. You might not do the coinjoin properly
2. You might later relate your non anonymous coins to your anonymous coins somehow
3. You might spend your "anonymous" coins in a way that identifies yourself
If you really want anonymous coins: research coin join, use a fresh machine and TOR, never mix your anonymous coins or spend them in a way that identifies yourself

There are proposed solutions




Lightning should accomplish this


I'm not sure if preventing is the right word anymore. The solution is to prevent centralized miners from being able to abuse their power too much by limiting what they can do, and also to keep opening doors to a future where a big miner has no advantage, which should push things to level out


The idea is to have many projects built on top of Bitcoin as a foundation, then people can decide which projects they want to use for themselves. Bitcoin would remain stable and no policy would be enacted there, only at higher levels


Dropzone, OpenBazaar (somewhat)


Lightning, SegWit+Confidential Transactions, &gt; Decentralized funding of developers based on the amount of work they have pushed to git, possibly in the form of escrow multisig payments, when accepted.
People don't donate, this was tried multiple times and it failed


This doesn't work because we haven't found anything that really works at scale. The work of proof of work can't be switched to something else without big tradeoffs 
Many altcoins promise false things in order to take your money, be careful out there.

Bitcoin that cannot ever change PoW is not Bitcoin because it's quite possible there is an error or problem with the PoW and it needs to be changed. This problem may include the catastrophic failure of the decentralizing mechanism wherein miners feel that they can dictate consensus rule changes.
Satoshi when introducing the project discussed having an issue with the hash function and explained that the hash function could just be changed if there was an issue, so the solution here was always well known.

I see it as an equilibrium, other actors in the space have their own demands and priorities that are not the same as Core's. Gavin recognized this imbalance since he talks to various actors and he sought to rebalance away from Core, but he overestimated the rebalance drastically with XT which created a big mess. It did reveal that the balance was off though, so now a more modest approach is being taken to rebalance. The long term question is: can we keep a cooperation going with people who have different goals for the system or will it never find a stable equilibrium and just fall apart?
@_date: 2016-01-02 08:49:58
Forking is a start, since he hasn't really changed much of the code base and was just content to keep him implementation mostly the same for a long time. But also he keeps merging in Core commits and not making commits of his own. So he's telling people to use the work of Core out of one side of his mouth and telling people Core is incompetent out of the other side of his mouth.

It looks like you are re-spending some other transactions that were confirmed a while ago, so those may have slowed this transaction down.
It's still possible that your transactions will complete in the next 24 hours. I would check back in later. For reference, in the past 24 hours about 25% of all confirmed transactions used fees that are similar to yours. However they take the lowest priority, and thus the longest time.

It's not safe - controlling your own keys is a good start but it's not enough. You also need to make sure that when receiving funds that they are valid - they have repeatedly failed here. You also need to make sure that those keys were generated randomly - they have repeatedly failed here. You also need to make sure that those keys aren't distributed to others without your permission - they have repeatedly failed here. Do not use that service, I can warn you but you have to make up your own mind of course.

- You make the protocol immune to oversized transaction attacks (previously we relied on the the block limit for this), this has already been done.
Explain how this has been done exactly? it has not been done. Even at the most basic level, you could spam flood the network as has already been proved many times in recent history. This increases the cost to every full node operator. Eliminating the block limit also eliminates the cost limit to all the full node operators
- You give nodes control over what size block they will pass along. This gives the control of the lever to the ecosystem - if miners create blocks too big for the network to carry they end up orphaned, which is expensive, so miners must keep their block sizes conservative.
You know that nodes aren't the ones who orphan blocks right? It's miners who build the blockchain. Nodes just pass things along. Miners are already directly connected to each other. Miners can run their own nodes too, they already run hundreds of them, running thousands of them would be easy
- They can do that already, it doesn't give them control unless they all do it together.
Only 1 or 2 pools can do it

Idiot problems
- the price fluctuates: we need idiots to have fiat stable balances using hedging or just virtual fiat with counterparty risk.
- the address and price copying problem: we need browsers to recognize btc links and have a way to just show a big "buy" button and nothing else.
- the in person QR code unwieldy ness: idiots should just stick to online stuff for Bitcoin until nfc standards for transfer are ubiquitous and the phone can just show a big "buy" button
- consumer advantage problem: all businesses accepting Bitcoin need to give at least a 1% discount. The marketing message needs to be save money with Bitcoin, which even an idiot can understand. This is justified because this should still beat PayPal and CC but give merchants an open and fair payments marketplace not controlled by a small set of companies
- security problem: idiots should keep all their password and private keys logically separated from the Internet and secured in their home. Only discrete actions should be online, with multi factor sign off from a non idiot third party approving all actions
- consumer protection problem: counterparty agencies need to be setup like Coinbase that can protect the buyer from the seller at an additional cost to the transaction and validate sellers as being trustworthy

The active core devs don't feel like the way forward for Bitcoin is for every transaction to hit the blockchain. The blockchain is designed for ultimate reliability, anti-gaming, anti-DOSing, etc. It's not designed as a world database or as a very fast payment processor or as a way to send enormous numbers of transactions
Instead of expanding the blockchain to support those features, they want specialized "level 2" services to be built on top of the blockchain. 
Lightning is one of those services that is a payment processing protocol that works more like Visa and MasterCard's for relatively expensive to run but very high throughput transaction processing. The key difference is that it is still decentralization friendly: anyone can run one of these lightning nodes if they have the power and budget, and it is still Bitcoin: it settles up with Bitcoin in a way that requires only minimal changes to the existing Bitcoin protocol

I have a theory that increasing block size will actually lead to increased individual fees in certain circumstances.
The reason why is that currently the Blockchain is a bad platform for cloud storage, due to the blocksize limit. There are people who try to add little messages here and there, but it's not really a serious platform due to the limitation on space: you can't really hope to scale this message business up.
However let's say that we allow the block size to be whatever the lowest minimum fee person will pay and it will always increases in size automatically to allow that? Well that opens the door to new businesses that start using the block at the lowest possible rates as a cloud storage system
Uh oh, you just introduced a new customer type into the system. Yeah, they are always going to be at the low end of the market, but "next block" space will pretty much always be limited no matter what the limit is at, so now we have two customers for that next block: currency people and space people. 
Before we just had currency people, so we have increased demand for limited space, which means currency people might end up paying more than they were before. In other words the space customers might consume the entire low end of the market for fees, which means a currency customer would always have to pay a higher rate than the minimum, unlike now where they often do not.

Any trivial or even complex PoW in the browser won't work at all because a determined attacker will be able to generate PoW so much faster than a browser PoW that the restriction won't be any barrier at all to him.
Instead, something like 21's micropayment channels could be used to transmit small but meaningful value. The TOR foundation or CloudFlare itself could create a quality signaling service for your public key - you make tiny payments to them as you ask to be validated, in return they sign a statement that you paid them a little bit.
CloudFlare should even implement this for non TOR users, because some people want to block Google from tracking them (why do you think that Google offers this Captcha service for free) or Google is blocked in their countries and they are unable to complete it (for example, 1 billion+ people in China behind the GFW can't complete any Google Captcha at all).

You should expect to wait up to 2 hours for a transaction, even with the highest possible fee, even if blocks are empty. It's part of how Bitcoin works
Your wallet can do the data analysis for you, and it looks like it worked pretty OK to me. The only way it could have done better is to give you a "pay more for priority" button, which you might not have wanted to press anyway.
Even though your last transaction might have taken 7 minutes, there is a random element to confirmations that has always been in the system and it is vital to how Bitcoin works.

Using the Blockchain at busy times requires a fee, otherwise you are de-prioritized
The Blockchain is a shared resource and transactions have a real cost on the network, the fee helps both to pay that cost and to prevent people from abusing the shared resource
You can avoid fees by avoiding the Blockchain, for example Changetip for small amounts where the fee is a problem 
The costs to the network are:
1. The network requires a system of security to operate that is based on spent electricity and this fee pays for this electricity. 
2. Transactions take up bytes of space that have to be synced to the network, and stored by the network and verified by the network, the fee prevents this amount of bytes from getting out of control. The fee also determines the ordering of which bytes to process first

CloudFlare using PoW instead of Captchas to stop abuse sounds good to me, but the issue with PoW is that we've seen that a dedicated attacker can outperform a standard user with millions times cheaper performance. This makes PoW worthless at distinguishing an attacker from a normal user
Of course Bitcoin is just stored PoW and has solved this problem - and now in the most recent version of Bitcoin Core it's already got automatic integration with TOR - can Cloudflare connect the dots?

I think the conversation should be about inflation - it's hidden in the west through fancy re-calculations and also actually fairly historically low at the moment, but for someone living in an emerging economies like Brazil, South Africa: inflation will decimate your savings or even just your spending money and wages.
The volatility of Bitcoin obscures the benefit of predictable inflation, but volatility has a chance to increase your funds at least, whereas inflation is deliberate and ever downwards. 
In South Africa, inflation has been at 7% for the past 10 years and 30 years ago it was over 20% a year - if you are not wealthy or savvy enough to be in stocks and bonds and you keep your money in cash, that's a huge expense, especially since the expense is compounding.

It could work that way, there's still a lot of bigger fish to fry, more important changes that need to be addressed. Over the next five years I think a combination of approaches could lead to a 10x on-chain increase, but we are trying to make Bitcoin go 100x and 1000x.

It's not about tx/sec though, it's about solving problems for people. No one's problems are solved by tx/sec increases, that's just one dumb metric but our real goal is freedom of money, not greater tx/sec. If we could only get 1 tx/sec but still deliver on the project goals, that would be great.

Confirmations are only necessary if you need a large degree of trust
If it's you and your trusted friend, you can just send and then he has it, you can even do it offline by sharing the transaction data
Confirmations are basically the last line of defense, something extremely difficult to overcome
Scalability isn't a huge issue, but it is a concern. Bitcoin merchants almost always accept zero confirmation transfers and the risk of double spend should be far lower to the merchant than the comparative risk of credit card chargeback
Double spends aren't even all that common on the altcoin chains which have orders of magnitude less security than Bitcoin

Hey I'll give you one point, because I agree: it is all about utility and a lot of Bitcoin's utility comes from the network effect.
It is possible to turn Bitcoin into a centralized system that still can be used for sending money around and is popular and most everyone is happy. For example Skype, it used to be a peer to peer telephone service that used encryption so no one could spy on you or take down the network. What happened next is that Microsoft bought them out and replaced the peer to peer network with centralized servers and switched the encryption so that governments can listen in on people's calls. For 99% of the people they don't care, they just download Skype, whatever.
Personally, I think that future is not probable, just possible. I think a more likely future is that Bitcoin becomes centralized and then the government puts the same controls on it that they put on everything, including the other digital cash systems that came before like eGold, liberty dollar, flooz, and these controls are too onerous and the entire system will die.
That is why I prefer a system that is decentralized: no financial middlemen or centralized weak points, that cares about the 1%, not just the 99%.

Who says they won't do anything to increase decentralization? I can think of a number of major things they are working on or have finished that should promote decentralization.
As unpopular as the stance is, some core devs did voice the idea of a push back to 500k. They didn't have agreement on this topic and it went nowhere.
They are focusing on new features for new core versions that should help make it easier for people to run a node: a new crypto library to make verifying transactions many times faster, pruning to make running a node require much less disk space, a new way to do off chain trust less transactions using payment channels that should reduce the burden on the blockchain for many uses, new simplified verification modes to make running new types of lite clients much more trustless, etc
On the other side, Gavin calls running a node a fetish. Says there's only need for a dozen nodes. I think there's a clear separation of vision: core is working on and delivering decentralization. Gavin's goal is adoption and decentralization is a technical detail that will provide for itself. 
What that means exactly is Core is making it easier for you the average person to be able to run a full node if you choose, meaning more people will make that choice. As for miners they are making it harder for miners to have an unfair or centralizing advantage, although that's a very tough problem to fix at this particular moment in history.

Mike and Gavin don't see decentralization as priority number one, they want Bitcoin to be a Business standard, something made for a mainstream appeal that only borrows from its decentralized roots but  does not maintain them.

1. Moore's law doesn't apply to things that haven't been made scale linearly. In tests of BIP 101 nodes, increasing node size by 3-4x led to 20x slowdowns. Moore's law has also been running into its limits, it's not a law of the universe, it's a historical observation.
2. Mining is too centralized, why not make the network more centralized, fuck it! How is this a talking point?
3. We already increased the block size by 2x, nodes fell by 15%. Oh by the way as more people use the network we will definitely get more nodes from all the new people, except that we didn't, but we will. And let's increase the block size by 8000x, let's see what that will do to the node count, who knows.
4. Maybe miners can't actually use all the max block size. BTW a bigger max block size is good for surges, even though miners can't actually use it all. Because they can use it when there is a surge but not the other times for some reason that I won't name: free market!

With any perfectly standard soft fork (there have been many), your software does not need to be updated if you don't choose to. It will continue working just as it did before.

What I see happening is that there will be a fee level which is like 0-12 hours, a fee level which is 12-24, and a fee level which is 24-48
So if it's a fee that is 0-12 hours, maybe there is a chance that it will slip into 12-24, but much less chance to slip to 24-48 and even less chance to slip to never confirm
Not every transaction broadcast today confirms, that much has been true for a long time on the network

The reward for "centralizing" Bitcoin is efficiency and mainstream appeal. If Bitcoin becomes something that you access through financial middlemen, those middlemen make it easier and cheaper for Joe Average, so it's easier to get Joe Average using it. The more Joe Averages using Bitcoin, the more early adopters' coins are worth.
The way to "kill" Bitcoin is not through direct attack, it's by redefining the concept through lexical jujitsu to mean something that requires trusted third parties. The actual idea will hold up and there will always be adherents to the actual cause, but there will always be the temptation to sell out the freedom of decentralization's chaos for the power of centralization's order.

Core isn't a single person, it's a bunch of random people, many of whom have been working on Bitcoin for years. Generally they will tend to discuss every change to death before making it. Also since this change wouldn't be consensus changing, you could easily opt out of it if you were a miner. Also one core developer didn't agree with exactly how it was going to be put in and he put a different way into his version that is still compatible but allows easier opting out

It will just get more rancorous as time progresses and we are at an impasse. People will resist SegWit by manufacturing imaginary problems with it, by refusing to implement it, by rallying miners to block it. They've already begun this process. 
Coinbase which is screaming the most shrilly about capacity problems, they haven't even devoted developer resources to implementing SegWit, which has many other universally accepted fixes and improvements in addition to increasing capacity.
This reveals the true agenda which is to manufacture a fake crisis and then take advantage of the resulting panic to install a powerful leadership who can then take ownership of the dev process. Much to their lament the Bitcoin Core devs are a bit too high in the IQ department to fall for that old chestnut

Any miner collaboration could do that, the core principle of Bitcoin is that the majority of the miners will work to benefit the network, soft fork or no soft fork they could always fool full nodes (for a while, at a cost).

A lie from can make it halfway around the world before the truth can get its pants on.


Not correct. The computation adjusts to the hashing power of participants


Very very few IRL stores accept Bitcoin. And they weren't making you wait around ten minutes - which can actually be up to two or three hours because of normal variance. And if you tested any normal client which used a slightly higher fee due to the spam attack, it would have gone through in 100% normal time.


They just changed to 0.12. This "known profits today" thing makes no sense, they make their profits from block rewards, fees are 1% of their revenue.


Even 10 mb isn't that much space. That's why this isn't a good long term scalable solution


Incorrect: you just can't rely on using Bitcoin to be a super low fee way of making a purchase. You can rely on getting in the next block, if you pay the fee. The current fastest fee  is $0.027. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:00:32

I've seen the idea that larger blocks should be limited by "orphan rates".
It means that it turns making Bitcoin more scalable into a negative thing. A thought experiment: developers solve block propagation and verification times between miners making them instant. Now that one thing holding back the block size is gone.
So making orphan rates a protection against huge blocks would make reducing orphan rate factors like making verification faster and networking more efficient actually hurt instead of help.
I do agree with the general point though that more transactions can make more money for miners, especially when you factor in the competition from alternatives. If you sell a new video game you don't make it free but you also don't just sell a limited number of copies and make people bid for them.

I am not a lawyer, and laws vary from locale to locale. However every relaying Bitcoin node also passes along transactions and miners also include transactions in their blocks.

Yeah I don't mean immediately, I mean either as a proposal or as part of the big block hard fork
Emergency hard forks have discarded the "correct" fork in favor of the "incorrect" side to maintain compatibility
I do think they sound too afraid of a hard fork and that getting the experience of a hard fork could be very powerful and good. However, that benefit needs to be weighed properly with the costs: roll out a hard fork that is well regarded and give tons of lead time.

All major currencies are swapped on exchanges where they swap back and forth to determine the value.
The currency is not controlled by China, as far as mining goes they must work within the rules and will face severe costs if they try to abuse the system.

If blockspace is always treated as if it is "free", well then the people who actually bear the cost (full nodes) will have to pay up. So don't be surprised when they speak out, like I'm doing now, and say: "No, let's have a limit on this cost."

You can potentially merge-mine a side chain - this lets you mine Bitcoin and the sidechain at the same time, giving them the same hash power. Or you can mine a different way, like using a different PoW. Or you can setup a bunch of trusted delegates. The world is your oyster

Take it up with I guess? The fastest possible fee at the moment for a transaction would be more like $0.05 - so the algorithm could be improved to fit your needs?
By the way you should always be prepared to wait hours for a transaction to go through, due to random variance that has been in Bitcoin since the start, that is always a possible time even for the next block.
Do you have a transaction id? I'm interested in seeing this transaction

Yes, you can have funds leave LN and go back into the Blockchain. (they never really left, they just were locked)


When using LN, you match to a channel partner who needs to sign off on you leaving LN, up until a date, when you can leave by yourself. So if the 3rd party partner is not cooperative, you can just wait and then just leave by yourself. The design is that the channel partner has every reason to cooperate with you, and no reason not to cooperate, so it's expected that they will pretty much always sign off on you leaving if you want to.

Old wallets can't ever be expected to check things that they don't know about. At any moment miners could be running secret rules that you don't know about, or implement RBF or anti-RBF or any number of thing that would prevent a 0-conf transaction from going through, even though to a node, it would look like it should go through. 
I don't know why you even brought up 0-confirmation transactions because they are outside of the security model of Bitcoin, they are just a pending send, there are many tricks that can be pulled to make them not go through and there is no recommendation to trust them

The Core developers have been addressing it by working to offer real solutions. They've made validation 7x faster. They've made a fast relay network. They've made a new type of transaction that takes up 25% of the space. They've fixed problems with the database. They've solved large block transactions creating DOS vulnerabilities. They've made a new way to sync miner blocks that is 2x faster. The list of things they have done is very long.

The lie is pretending somehow that the thousands and thousands of fake cloud nodes are in any major way a DDOS prevention mechanism for classic node operators, when their numbers dwarf the previous counts of classic nodes. 
Before any mention of ddos there were maybe 500 home classic nodes? Now there are thousands of cloud classic nodes (plus still 500 or so home classic nodes). What you are doing is rationalizing this Sybil attack, when it's clear as day what's going on for 99% of these thousands of cloud nodes: they are trying to fake the appearance of network support to try and fraudulently convince people that classic has broad support amongst node operators, which is false. They are definitely not home nodes that switched to the cloud, the simple numbers prove the lie of that.
Soaking up bandwidth as you describe doesn't even make sense, a ddos operator can avoid targeting a cloud node just as easily as I can tell the difference between a cloud node and a home node. 
Gavin called for this, for thousands of nodes to be run by individual operators, which is what we see now. Stop doing this, it is unhealthy for the network to have people playing pretend voting. We can see the results of this terrible scheme playing out in front of our eyes: miners colluding, ddoses, classic people like Brian Armstrong calling the devs a systemic threat and calling everyone to participate in the node count "election". Stop the fake election and let people voluntarily decide for themselves.

From my perspective, Bitcoin was never about Blockchain capacity, it was always about Coin scarcity. It's impractical to imagine all the world's transactions on the chain - that's a pipe dream.

Why won't you interview with Junseth? I agree that they are overly aggressive and have informed my impression of Factom to a large degree, but look at the context: this is a market where altcoin scams and half baked ideas that won buzzword bingo are a dime a dozen. I took back their claims, even though I feel they are mostly correct but not thoroughly researched enough to be concrete. 
This is the pattern of all the other altcoin scams, so in that context they are deservedly skeptical of what otherwise might be though of as outsized marketing claims. You sell an altcoin token, further adding to that similarity. These efforts feel like profiteering, from stealing credibility from the mission of Bitcoin. 
You refuse to take the offered out of exuberant marketing though, even after I offered that as a compromise. This makes you seem defensive, you can't accept that your strong "marketing" seems like a lie when it is presented to sell an investment in Factom coins?

A quantum attack could be mitigated by:
1. Changing all clients to never reuse an address (this prevents the signature from being known to anyone before broadcast so it can't be brute forced until that point)
2. Eliminating replace by fee from miners, this is already very uncommon and would eliminate the window of attack where the signature could be forged in the time window before a block
This attack is unlikely to appear out of nowhere and threatens all secure computing, so there'd be plenty of time to find and implement a solution, the biggest danger is the uncertain human element of rolling out hardening to the community at large

in this space is strictly superior to not, and I think it makes larger
sizes safer long term;  I do not think it adequately obviates the need
for a hard upper limit for two reasons:


difficult to develop, test for, or provision for something without
knowing limits. There would in fact be hard limits on real deployments
but they'd be opaque to their operators and you could easily imagine
the network forking by surprise as hosts crossed those limits.


miners around fees;  it does not correct the incentive alignment between
miners and everyone else (miners can afford huge node costs because they
have income; but the full-node-using-users that need to exist in plenty
to keep miners honest do not), or the centralization pressures (N miners
can reduce their storage/bandwidth/cpu costs N fold by centralizing).

If the miners don't want to help coordinate a SegWit soft fork, that's their business too, they don't owe us anything.
We need to engineer solutions that give people what they want, without requiring others do things they don't want. That's the right direction for Bitcoin

Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen don't have any regard for cutting out the middleman. There's no way to use Bitcoin right now without middlemen unless you use a full node: Mike Hearn commit multiple patches to XT that made a full node easily DOS-able if you are an amateur node host, Gavin is quoted directly as saying that running a node is a weird fetish and you should have to select from no more than 12 trusted nodes
That is precisely "middleman clearinghouse": changing Bitcoin so you must use a "professional node" in order to use Bitcoin.

In the past 24 hours 2026 transactions were confirmed with no fee. How did that happen if there is a min fee? How do you think the min fee is enforced?
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:40:04
It's not that it's not been a use-case, as I point out it has been something we've had to deal with forever
Satoshi and later developers have tried to deal with this problem by saying, "we can't stop it, but we can label it so that we can try and make it less of a problem in the future"
So OP_RETURN is a way to deal with that, to be able to prune data that is not important from the currency customers
The issue though is that in a world of unbounded block space, how do we disincentive that use? Some people call any use of the blockchain valid or any design that seeks to determine how it is used to be central planning, but most others would consider the non-zero cost that each transaction has on the system as a whole, and say that it should be discouraged for fear of interfering with the intended purpose of the system to serve as a currency and not a cloud storage mechanism
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:11:06
It might have had a broadcast problem, it's only been seen for 2 hours on the network, not 4 hours
Up until 1 hour ago it was depending on an unconfirmed transaction. You shouldn't try respending your coins until they are confirmed
It should still confirm though. The fee is about 5x lower than a fast fee so it should go a bit slower than normal. In the past 3 hours transactions with this fee level confirmed in 30min to 1 hour.

Bitcoin as a unit of account won't necessarily suffer. As a hypothetical, imagine the blockchain was too annoying to use and everyone just used Coinbase and Circle to transfer Bitcoin. If Coinbase raised their fees, people could just go to Circle right? If Circle raised them, make a new system that's cheaper?
Same deal with the Blockchain, higher fees just give you a motivation to go to a cheaper option. They don't stop you using Bitcoin. We are talking about fees of $0.05 here, not a fortune

If it's 11 and it comes out after Segwit then there's gonna have to be a change to 12. Then people will have to decide if they want 12's opt in RBF or not, which will make a two issue patch, etc

Yes Lightning Network can help fungibility because the routing is not broadcast, it is routed, and only the routers it touches can see the transaction. Another possible improvement is that all the transaction details including the source and destination can be encrypted.
We're talking about a work in progress though so how it shakes out remains to be seen. And at the end of the day there is another problem which is that amounts can still be monitored. If a lightning channel opens with one amount on one side and then closes with the same amount on another side: it's not hard to connect the dots no matter what happens in the middle

Oh you are saying that they would just select themselves a minimum fee and not just zero.
I don't know if the hard cap would definitely reduce the potential revenue of the fee market, since here you are ignoring price elasticity which is super important and could lead to a completely different result, but the potential is there for more transactions to mean more overall fee revenue.
I think what defenders of a hard cap to promote a fee market would argue (not that I'm one of them, devil's advocate here) is that a small fee market would be more predictable. If I release a movie and my goal is to fill the seats, I might make more money by releasing in 100 theaters, but if I release only in 1 theater it might be a lot easier for me to make sure that theater's show is sold out.

Yes in part, the original proposal for securing the network was to see transaction fees go to subsidizing the hash power security.
It is not the only proposal however, and the block reward will remain very sizable for 20 years and still present for 100 years. There are even other ideas for proof of work being discussed that may take over by that time, ideas that would not require the same subsidy setup.
Trying to predict technology 10 years out is hard, 20 years out is very hard, 40-100 years out is insanity wolf.
The current level of hash power security is considered by many to be overkill, so it's not anticipated that at the half point there would be an issue. 
Also hashing technology has gotten better at an extremely rapid rate, meaning by the time the half point arrives we could actually be flat with today's level hash power.

75,000 low fee tx * 258 bytes * 10 satoshis/byte fee / 100,000,000 satoshis per Bitcoin * 430 USD/Bitcoin = $832.05/day. If half the transactions are legit, it's only $400/day or about $10k/month

By selectively painting VPS nodes as an anti-DDOS measure and not mentioning that the actual vast majority are fake nodes, you are saying that a tiny minority is significant in this tally, which is false, and you know that. These particular nodes in this particular article, we have heard from who is running them and we can see the services running them, and these people and services have only one objective: fake the node count.
The block count is also fake - it's a fake out that if the magic 75% number is reached that there will be no chance for 2 active chains. There is no logical reason that this would be true. It's another lie that is pushed to promote Classic. From auto downvoting bots, to fake node counts, to lies about how Bitcoin works, to even erasing "Toomim" from the classic website to avoid the drug use association - Classic is about carefully manipulating information to present a false picture to try and get people to sabotage their own interests and attempt a divisive and coercive hard fork

I've heard this directly from Gavin etc. Endless increases. His own proposal called for adding up to a terabyte of transactions a day to the blockchain 
@_date: 2016-01-02 09:34:03
He didn't seem to test anything larger and those larger sizes would come to pass quite quickly. Also it's a bit subjective if he really did test 20mb since his simulation was critiqued as being flawed.
Further testing has since revealed that there are problems even with the smaller size, like even the reduced block sizes potentially increasing the orphan rate by 300% - Even will probably admit that there are still big problems to solve to improve how miners propagate larger blocks to each other.
Tests of well connected mining peers showed that a big block (using current bip 101 proposed sizes) that would take 1 second to send between the peers would take 20 seconds to actually sync and verify (that's where the orphan rate problems come from).

That doesn't make sense because if these attacks were profitable and desirable the miners could have triggered these attacks at the start of SegWit.

Yeah it looks to have zero confirmations, and the source of the funds seems to currently have no confirmed funds.
So it looks like their software made a mistake, and the way they are re-using addresses, it makes it seem certain they messed up and sent funds marked for you somewhere else. 
You should let them know you did not get your funds and they can confirm that independently and then fix it
By the way you also should not re-use addresses, only use each address for 1 transaction

You could say the same thing about 100% of the other users of Bitcoin. If they choose to stop accepting Bitcoin as money, then Bitcoin is similarly "useless". That doesn't mean I have to pay attention to their votes. What they do is their business, what I do is my business.
Impact on someone else doesn't equal changing someone else. If I call you a ninny, maybe that hurts your feelings, but I didn't change you, I just expressed myself. Miners are free to ignore my transactions, that's their prerogative. Bitcoin is a cooperative system, the most you can do is refuse to cooperate. You can vote on whether you want to cooperate, but you don't have to follow the vote, because there is nothing binding you to it.

That's where we've come, Bitcoin is thousands of times better now than it was in those dark days.
What a cheap copout to say, "let's build a system based on web of trust and no Proof of Work. you guys go do that." If it's possible: you make it, don't just lazily say it's better.
Mining being in China is a temporary market situation - just like mining being all through GHash was before it. Miners are only one piece in a peer to peer puzzle, they even self identify so you could ignore them if you choose.

Leaving it on an exchange might be equally bad or worse though, depending on the exchange and your level of security around your login. Exchanges like mtgox have been known to lose all funds, plus people can hack your login

I like this plan except for one problem: it's too slow. A planned hard fork can be very disruptive, it must give a lot of lead time.

That's not accurate, when a transaction is sent to them they can still validate it. They can also still send transactions. I don't see what more you would want out of a node really. For all we know there is already a secret SegWit-like block addition going on and we aren't validating that

My comment would be either to close the "Foundation" forever (what good things are there to salvage there? Can't think of anything but a tainted legacy of being helmed by thieves) or:
- Shut down everything for retooling
- Do not reopen until you have a clear mission that serves the actual point of Bitcoin not just the brand name, whatever people happen to slap it on.
- Only include reputable members of the Bitcoin community in your dealings, zero altcoin or fiat promoters (unless the altcoin is aligned with the mission of Bitcoin)
- Don't include any engineering representation unless they are actively writing code, otherwise just call them a technical advisor, and don't add any technical advisors unless you have engineering already represented.
- Remove the stuff about "avoiding regulations" and change it to "protecting the right of everyone to use Bitcoin"
- Rework the entire mechanism of the foundation to focus on grassroots activism instead of industry trade organization.

I'm not convinced they could form a cartel without the soft fork limit as you suggest since the first to leave the cartel would be rewarded and then everything would fall apart.

I'm not sure what you are proposing? The solution to this is managed expectations. Bitcoin is not an instant transaction system.
You can't "encourage math", that's just the facts of this solution which so far is the only working solution and may be the only possible solution to this particular problem.
It's clearly not really useless to use, considering its used already quite often. If you want instant purchase, coinbase offers that already. If you trust the person sending there isn't even a need for a confirmation

For regular nodes, thin blocks or techniques like it can only improve bandwidth by a factor of 2 at best: all they do is reduce the double-sending of transactions (once as unconfirmed and then as part of a block).

If you think about it at a zoomed out level, the USA already has this to a large degree: with foodstamps and Medicare, large amounts of people's "money" is limited use.

1. There is no possible way to guarantee there is no chain split in any soft fork. Any activation strategy risks that, user driven or miner driven.
2. I'd rather have an inclusive Bitcoin that is reliable and stable with a growing network effect, not one that is fragmenting.

Many Bitcoin wallets try to hide the complexities of Bitcoin away. If someone sends to you, or you send to someone, and it goes over the Blockchain, you need an address to send to.


The Blockchain is the ledger, there's a network of computers that all sync it. It is peer to peer, you can just broadcast to a single node and it will re-broadcast, yes.


If you want to receive Bitcoin, go to your wallet and press "receive". It should give you an address that you can tell to whoever will send you Bitcoin. An address does not need to have Bitcoins to receive Bitcoins


In theory you could generate the same address as someone else, however the chance of that happening is so small you don't need to worry about it. You don't need to "register" an address to claim it, just the pure enormous randomness of a private key allows you to claim it and be confident no one else has the same private key. Addresses aren't the same as public keys. 


Bitcoin is generally considered the coin, addresses are the addresses you can send coin to. There are a lot more than 21 million addresses, way way more.


A Bitcoin is like a real coin: it's a number that represents a balance in your favor.
If you want to send Bitcoin to someone, ask them for an address to send to and that's how you reduce your balance and increase their balance, in other words: send money to them
A wallet is a piece of software that helps you manage your Bitcoin: executing sends, verifying transactions, giving you control of your funds.

There are multiple types of SegWit transactions to account for different types of smart contracts
There is a new script hash tech that will take a while to be used - you can read about it here: 
It's quite important that we upgrade to this though because there is a security vulnerability where some types of smart contracts can be brute forced and the money stolen. In any likely scenario this would take a huge investment to actually build the machinery capable of cracking the smart contract, however computing is getting cheaper exponentially and people depend on their funds being uncrackable for years, so we need to do this now

It wouldn't necessarily double the fees, it could even lower the total fees. Imagine if the block size was 1gb or 10gb, people would all pay the bare minimum, either in the defaults of their software or in the default min relay fee. Total fees will only go up if the price is at a moving sweet spot based on overall demand.
That being said, it seems like a good bet they would be earning more total after a while.
Also, miners are a strange business. Their overall profits are designed to go to zero. It's the electricity companies who should want mining to make more revenue, not the mining companies.

"You people" - I think your prejudice is peeking through


No, Satoshi did hard forks which were good (I'm a user of one of them). They have their pros and cons. Not all hard forks are bad, not all hard forks are good.


I never claimed this, I don't even really know what this means.


SegWit proposes to split the signature into a new accompanying data structure, so it makes a new larger block.


The user experience of having a zero fee transaction right now is to wait for the network to forget about it. With opt-in RBF you can re-submit with a higher fee and the miners will pick it up: no more waiting, better user experience.


Simple thought experiment: blocks are 8GB and only super rich people or companies can sync them. Can you still claim bitcoin is peer to peer, an average user doesn't need to trust anyone?


Alternative coins means an alternative ledger, a hard fork means an alternative ledger, therefore a hard fork is an alternative ledger is an alternative coin.

I don't see how the bus analogy fits? With one strategy you have a bus with 40 seats that fits 40 fatties, with another strategy you have a bus with 20 seats that fits 20 fatties or 40 skinnies, or some mix of both. In both you can get the same 40 people on the bus - although one is harder because you gotta get all of the fatties to lose weight and become skinnies.
Basically your argument then is that it's too hard to get fatties to lose weight. My take is that if we get into a jam like totally full blocks and much higher fees, we have a big built in motivator to get the fatties to lose weight so they'll go for it, SegWit shouldn't be that hard to implement and deploy across the board since there will be sample code and from a transaction broadcast point of view it's just a reformatting of what we have already.

I think that's the current devs argument, let's make bitcoin into a settlement network, not a payments network. It's doing that job already, it's well understood, anyone can run it, changing bitcoin would mess with that and we'd need very difficult consensus to change it anyways
Hearn and Gavin are just two voices and it's easy to make posts, it's hard to write software.
I no longer trust Hearn because a) he's writing straw man arguments like bitcoin-qt will have various issues with a 1mb block that can clearly be fixed without a hard-fork and b) he's got vested interests in his personal projects that are not 100% aligned with bitcoin's goals and c) he's looking at bitcoin as if it's just a new social network he's working on at Google when in fact it's a political project
On the other hand I also don't like the argument "we need to figure out fees market now because in 20 years the block rewards will be low". 20 years is an eternity in software time. The rewards don't even fully go away for 100 years. Also the current fees aren't so insignificant. The fees are currently 1/100 of the block rewards. Multiply the block by 100, you end up with 100x the fees, we maintain the current level of security

I would suggest you talk with them in the name of full transparency. The way you characterize the history of this sounds very suspect to me because it conflicts with my own recollection, not any article calling you out specifically
Here is the timeline I remember:
Articles came out about this Honduras deal:
1. 2015 May -  - "Honduras, one of the poorest countries in the Americas, has agreed to use a Texas-based company to build a permanent and secure land title record system using the underlying technology behind bitcoin, a company official said late Thursday."
1. 2015 August - It's reported that it is not in fact a done deal at all and never really was - 
1. 2015 December - Factom posts a clarification that it wasn't a deal after all, but just a discussion - 
So, you could say that the facts are quite simple: yes it was oversold, yes we didn't clarify it or offer an update until well after we were called out on it. That doesn't sound like what you are saying, or that you are trying to say that in a way that makes you sound above reproach


The way this characterizes the tokens sounds suspect, as if the fact that Factom is done selling the altcoin tokens for now divorces it from the ability to profit on their increased valuation in the future. The only thing that separates people pulling altcoin scams from people making real crypto currency projects is total transparency or lack of direct token profit motive. That's why as soon as Factom started selling this speculative investment vehicle, Factom should have been careful to at all times from that point on to be completely up front and neutral about its future, and welcome scrutiny
Everything I am hearing sounds like a practiced rationalization that doesn't quite fit with the facts. That Factom was open and honest about the Honduras deal, when the majority and the reporting were under the mistaken impression that it was more than a discussion. That Factom has nothing to gain from people speculating on its tokens, when Factom holds future coins in reserve and can theoretically issue more at any time. I would think you should not be afraid of going in front of someone who will ask tough questions, to demonstrate that you are not afraid to be completely transparent with someone who will hold your feet to the fire

Even in Satoshi's offhand comment about raising the block size, he said that users can be given plenty of time to adjust, like a couple of versions notice.

All Bitcoin nodes deal with this type of attack occasionally. There were tests run to see if XT would increase the rate of being DOS'ed with this type of attack, they did not show that XT nodes get DOS'ed more frequently than any other node type. There are many more Bitcoin Core nodes and many are run by businesses that can hold up to a DOS, so it isn't as notable.

You know that u/gavinandresen is a politician, he says whatever he thinks will get him further at any time. I mean literally, he is an actual politician in real life: 
He used to say that he would try to convince people, or to work with people. That was before he went on the offensive. 


Then he changed his mind, he said that he would try to get consensus for a hard fork first:


Now he lobbies for people to hard fork without any of the active development team, without any major miner who is not linked closely to Jihan Wu, without any merchants, and with the exchanges now saying that they will list any BU as an altcoin.


If you didn't know it by know, Gavin Andresen is not insane, demented, stupid. Craig Wright did not bamboozle him, he is not well meaning but always not doing the right thing because he doesn't understand the details. It's far far worse than that. Gavin Andresen is a politician. He is a liar.

They could invest in continuing their attack, however it is much less likely to persist so the impact is limited. Look at the altcoins for example, miners don't often waste their time attacking them.

It could be forming the transaction incorrectly, that's a common problem in wallets
Even a large transaction, it can be formed in such a way that causes a small amount to be registered on the Blockchain, which is considered polluting and therefore rejected
Sometimes in other wallets this type of bug is because you are trying to send an amount that is too close to your total balance. If that's the case you can try sending less instead

I'm not so sure that it will take decades before we see another "financial crisis" that is just the natural consequence of too much short term thinking, regulatory capture, and a system based on incomprehensibly complex never ending chains of debt.
In some countries, fiat has outright failed right now.
A fiat world economy itself is a fairly new invention, of course the Chinese invented it for themselves a long time ago - as well as the first fiat collapse when they printed it endlessly and then had to go back to silver.
The modern world's departure from gold under Nixon wasn't all that long ago. But we now have a modern technological solution for money that addresses the issues with a gold standard not fitting into a modern economy. Now all that remains is for Bitcoin to be adopted (I agree though, big change, will probably take a long time)

I just reject that idea, it's am extraordinary claim and your proof of it is insufficient.

Hmm creating a polarized and divisive debate through political grandstanding, conspiracy theories and attacks like above, or moderating an unofficial forum unrelated to development. Which does more to retard development and tear down Bitcoin's network effect?

The smallest fee is zero not 1 satoshi, although there is hardly a difference at the moment. Mining security with a billion users times zero fees would mean no security if it just had to come from fees.


There are a lot of solutions for how to "scale", it's a very very broad concept and has many solutions both proposed and not yet proposed. In the worst case we can always use existing proven centralized ways to scale, even without a block size increase, that's what he's talking about with regard to Bitcoin being a "settlement network". You can read about the RBF he is referencing here: 


The logic goes: miners currently spend X dollars on Y security and are rewarded with Z mining reward + Fees. If the Z mining reward goes down, we need to replace them with fees? No because there is no reason that we cannot go down from our current hash power security level and still be extremely safe.


It's hard here to determine between three types of people:
1. Incorrect assumptions about Bitcoin
2. Different priorities for Bitcoin
3. Deliberately misleading

What you are looking for is essentially trade between someone who has usd and someone who has euro right?
Think about it this way, foreign exchange market between usd and euro is a huge multi trillion dollar dollar system. 
Why go to a very small and volatile system to trade, when there is a huge and efficient market to trade? It's like selling stuff on some no name auction site instead of eBay, you can do it if you want but probably less chance of the optimal outcome due to compared lack of sellers and buyers
The volatility of bitcoin can be huge, it can go down 10% in a day and not recover for months, if ever. If you just want to swap usd for euro why take on that risk? Eventually bitcoin will help here but it needs to grow a lot to get into this role
@_date: 2016-01-27 00:48:45

1. Mining does not power the network, it is a competition for who can add to the transaction history. Miners receive a bootstrapped reward that will go away, plus transaction fees that users attach to their transactions. When the reward goes away, the fees will remain.
2. Miners sync the blockchain with the rest of the network, it's a big file but it can only grow by a max of about 144mb per day. It's about 60gb now. Every transaction is kept, it's synced between nodes in a peer to peer process like bittorrent. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 15:28:57
You don't need to embed it in the blockchain, it can be built on top. Both stealth addresses and payments protocol are being developed to offer similar features, I know Electrum is working on a wallet implementation and I think Bitcoin qt will have a reference implementation

You should use the "recommended" fee option
@_date: 2016-03-01 10:32:06

It's not necessary at this moment to take any action to replace block rewards with fees. Miners are making $1 million a day, that is enough security money


It's quite possible we will get other improvements to get both SegWit and 2MB HF blocks. I'm not sure what point is being made here?


By decentralized my specific meaning is that I want to be able to use the network in a way that does not require middlemen. I currently run a node, it is the  bandwidth user on my computer, it requires not insignificant resources to run. These resources are much more costly than the tiny amount I spend on fees, which is under $0.25 per day. The idea that we can keep scaling on-chain therefore is sub-optimal for my access without middlemen because at a certain cost level I can no longer reasonably use the system without a middleman. Another point for decentralization is that if blocks grow quite large, it increases the resource requirement for miners, and they get more specific advantages, meaning less diversity, meaning more centralization of miners. Neither of those things are attractive prospects to me

No that's not the point. The point is that the majority of Classic VPS nodes are not present to resist DDoS - they are to "vote". You keep trying to distract from this simple fact. You can't pretend that these thousands of nodes are actually in use for economy reasons. Just think about that on the face of it: before classic came out there were 5k nodes and then after there are 7.5k nodes. So because of Classic there are 2.5k new people using full nodes to conduct their business?

The number of nodes is irrelevant
You means you, whoever you are who wants to use Bitcoin to send money without going through a 3rd party gatekeeper


You don't need to use the Blockchain to use Bitcoin. For example,  or any major Bitcoin exchange, they allow for transactions denominated in Bitcoin without ever touching the Blockchain
With SegWit, there could be 365 million transactions a year on the Blockchain. With the Lightning Network, it could increase the number of possible decentralized transactions by 1000x. There are plenty of transactions to go around


The number of node is not relevant

It's not expensive if you do it on Cloud services but they are already over half cloud nodes so after a while it starts to look a bit suspicious
Note that the Core node count was unchanged through classic nodes rise, and only after 0.12 came out did the core node count reduce and the 0.12 count rise an equal amount.
The numbers totally show the lie that full node operators want classic, at most 5% of them switched to Classic. This was also verified by tests in which looking at historical data, how many previously core nodes later reported as a classic node. That number never went above 5% and some core supporters changed to classic just to test if they would be ddosed, which none were. 
Ten times that number have now provably chosen core 0.12. Core 0.12 is such a high quality release that classic didn't even bother testing it before republishing it unchanged except for 1 default setting alteration, despite previously promoting classic as safer because "less code is better" and that 0.12 contains tons of code changes.

Decentralization is not about other people, it is about yourself.
Are you able to do what you want? In a centralized system, people can tell you what to do. In a decentralized system you cannot be controlled or stopped.
This is why big blocks are centralizing, because it makes it more expensive and difficult to be independent.
It makes you have to rely more on lite wallets, for example CoPay. If CoPay's servers go down, I can't move my coins very easily. If CoPay's server supports some weird change in the rules of Bitcoin like increasing the 21 million coin limit, they can do that and the CoPay App won't even tell me.
What I want to see is a removal of this power, CoPay servers should have no power to tell a CoPay client that there are more than 21 million coins. It should be very difficult, unlike today where it is very easy. This is the difference between decentralization and centralization

They still validate, just not exactly what everyone else is validating.

The random transaction strategy has a vulnerability. If you know that a node is dropping randomly, you broadcast many of your own false transactions to it, tons and tons, so many that it drops all the real ones. Also since nodes will re-broadcast transactions, so the effect will spread even beyond that one node. How do you know which one is the spammy or fake one that should be dropped?
I think some professional nodes + mining nodes should run like you say: never drop any transactions. They should just buy tons of memory and set it up so that they will never forget any transactions. It doesn't take many of these nodes to get propagation, for example XT nodes were propagating double spends successfully when they were around because XT decided double spends should be propagated as a warning to the merchant they were being attacked
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:15:54
Some nodes need to be able to drop or ignore valid transactions because otherwise they can have a problem staying online when there are way too many transactions to store or validate, like when there is a DOS

Yeah there's compromise, I accept that. But a vision doesn't necessarily need to be "zero tolerance", it can be a guiding principle. I'm just saying that some arguments are more towards a centralized crypto than a decentralized crypto.
I even suspect an altcoin could take the place of Bitcoin. If early enthusiasts don't care much about decentralization: how much will mainstream adopters? And especially when winning the appeal of the mainstream is given a huge and alluring payout to bribe the early adopters into accepting centralization tradeoffs...
But that just brings me back to why is Bitcoin even a thing? We've already got these efficient ways to move money that we aspire to like Visa's millions of TPS. Oh yeah it's because those efficient things aren't really ours, they are the gatekeepers'. Bitcoin is a hacky bad solution that is only necessary because all the good solutions are destroyed by having gatekeepers abuse their power. Why have bickering inefficient democracies when you can have efficient benevolent dictators? It's because in the end power structures without checks and balances from the "amateurs" they serve become corrupted and self destructive.

No because Segwit was coded as a multiplier, so instead of 4mb, it's 8mb
Mining centralization attacks proposed would be things like Chinese miners putting their nodes on a well connected network to each other. That way they'd have a big advantage in a race scenario, and would make more money and make blocks from outside China miners less reliable
It could also make other attacks easier, like selfish mining where pools withhold blocks from the network to make other miners waste their hashpower building on obsolete blocks

Even microtransactions aren't strictly necessary, it could keep an escrow amount that you'd trust them to deduct, you'd just have to trust them to count accurately. So you'd pay them $5 and they'd let you have N number of CAPTCHA bypasses
As far as identity goes, you'd be protected somewhat by Bitcoin pseudoanonymity, but yeah you could go farther with CoinJoining and eventually with Confidential Transactions. The alternative is Google's tracking cookies, which has its own identity tracking issues

Any confirmation can take up to 2 or 3 hours due to random variance.
If you pay the proper fee for a quick block, you will pretty much always get it
Fastest possible fee right now is $0.03 - 
@_date: 2016-03-02 17:27:24
The transaction looks fine, except that your wallet did not adjust the fee properly. Your transaction is more complicated than a normal one, and it's 2.5x bigger than normal, so the fee you used is about 3x too small for a fast confirming transaction.
Lower fee transactions are slower, so I would guess it would go through within the next 12 hours

Their Kowtowing to the miners is pretty gross, but the worst thing is the misleading information.
There's a campaign out there that says that full nodes are not what Bitcoin is about. Gavin says, "you should just pick from 12 or so" and that "running a Bitcoin node is a weird fetish". Coinbase and Bitpay are saying "Miners make all the decisions".
Why are they campaigning this way? Because they want people to ignore the fact that full nodes are the only thing making Bitcoin a trustless system so that they can make changes that would be prevented by the verification mechanisms that provide trustlessness. If people are led to believe that they can't have or shouldn't want the protection of a full node, that's almost as good as nullifying the protections of the full node. Just tell people that full nodes are not important, repeat this big lie over and over, and through convenience and apathy and bandwagoning, many will go along.

Yeah exactly, any variety of RBF is just an individual miner policy that could change at any instant and we might not even know about it
Opt-In RBF is a proposal with the goal of making a "safer" form of RBF that miners can implement feeling like they are helping the network more (by enabling very low fee transactions to avoid being ignored) than hurting (by increasing the complexity of implementing Bitcoin protocol things and enabling some marginal scamming of people who don't know about the risks)

As far as fees go, individual miners decide that 100% for themselves
Witness data is more easily pruned and fraud proofed which means it's less of a burden on full nodes. I wouldn't be surprised to see utxo expansion taxed for similar reasons. We don't have a very easy way to price transactions based on their cost to the network so educated guessing is encouraged

It's not black and white
Higher fees cause less usage of the chain, which is good because this constrains the problem of keeping the chain having the properties that we like: cheap for everyone to validate and thus hard for someone to attack
Lower fees cause more usage of the chain, which is good because it is easy and people are using Bitcoin which is good. 
The point is to have balance: fees that aren't so low that they jeopardize the system and that aren't so high that they threaten important use cases. And in achieving this balance, we must err on the side of resistance to attack because a Bitcoin that can be destroyed by an attack is a Bitcoin that is worthless, but a Bitcoin that doesn't serve many use cases is just a less useful Bitcoin

If Bitcoin is held back from various scaling solutions by people who don't want to scale using any way more complicated than changing a single number then it will continue to rise in some measure of popularity but another coin will also start rising that is not held back from improvements by wrongheadedness and it will develop a more robust platform and community for long term growth. By the time Bitcoin realizes that they should have been building a better Bitcoin and not just trying to preserve an imperfect status quo, it could be too late. That's exactly what we're trying to do to banks but we have no manifest destiny, it could happen to us.

Litecoin targets a faster confirmation rate and was designed to try and use a high memory requirement proof of work to make mining more decentralized and or democratic.
However Litecoin's faster confirmation rate misleads people into thinking it is faster to trust transactions as finalized and it leads to a higher orphan rate which leads to lower security against attacks. It's actually much slower to provide trust for transactions being confirmed.
Litecoin's proof of work alternative was not coded properly so it doesn't really make mining more decentralized or democratic. It's not clear if any proof of work can be designed to be resistant to custom hardware designs, but Litecoin's attempt was proved unable to resist custom hardware.
Litecoin doesn't have a lot of usage, although it's well represented on exchanges since it has a long history.  Even though Litecoin transactions are much cheaper to send than Bitcoin transactions and Litecoin can potentially include 4x as many transactions as Bitcoin, Bitcoin has 40x more transactions per day

Yes I'm a developer, I've never done any other work in fact. Unless what I'm making is very clearly a throw away prototype I write and then rewrite my code and write comprehensive tests, I also document everything separately and comprehensively even if I am the only likely dev.
So I do buy Mike's arguments with regard to the value of keeping things simple and not too convoluted. However I feel he presents them in a one sided way. In my experience it's always a judgement call whether to make a clean break with older code to avoid technical debt. He may be right about it, but he may be wrong about it.
I don't really agree with the "soft fork is unavoidable" argument although I see what you're saying, what I'm saying is that a hard fork can redefine anything, so why not any of the soft forks that should have been hard forks.
To cut to the chase, I feel Mike doesn't have enough skin in the game. He's looking over the shoulder of these devs, rather than contributing side by side. Maybe he thinks they would shun him, but he could always be playing in his own XT sandbox to prove them wrong. In this particular case, he doesn't speak from the kind of authority of having written large parts of the code or having to pay the technical debt.
I don't always disagree with him on his technical cost points though, for example I agree with his assessment that the Lightning Network has the potential to be too complex for wallet developers to implement. He's got a lot of authority there, since he's worked on Bitcoin wallet implementations himself (although he seems to have given up on that). His argument there seems sound since a Lightning client does sound tricky to implement.
I even like the concept of going for hard forks (although never suddenly without some emergency cause), but I hate the idea that we are deprecating full nodes already without solving trust and privacy problems that happen when you don't run one (Gavin called running a full node a fetish) and I hate the idea that people want to run what I see as a cavalier risk of creating two incompatible Bitcoins to solve a future potential problem that is possible but just theoretical at this point.

Ignore the altcoins, they're not worth your time, most are just straight copies of bitcoin which is an open source project that can very easily be copied by anyone.
Depending on where you live bitcoins are pretty easy to get. Localbitcoins is a good option if you aren't in the U.S. or Germany, otherwise circle or coinbase
Why Bitcoin? It's not about gift cards, it's about the freedom to own your own money. 
Bitcoin is like cash or gold, it's something you can physically own yourself without relying on someone else to hold it for you. You can take it with you to anywhere on earth. You can send it to anywhere on earth, no questions asked. Bitcoin uses planned and limited inflation, unlike fiat currencies which will lose value as you hold them guaranteed. It's not easy to jump in, but it's slowly getting better. If it's too technical for you just check back later.
The other thing Bitcoin does is that it cuts the financial companies out of the loop. Ever go to Vegas and say hmm how did these casinos afford huge fancy buildings? Now think about how banks have outlets all over the world, they're not in the business of losing money. In the U.S. their revenues equal the military industrial complex. That money is coming from being a middleman between you and your money, you and your favorite coffee shop, your boss etc, they take a little off the top everywhere and it adds up to a lot. Bitcoin takes no percentage of any transaction to send or receive, just a small (pennies) fixed rate fee for each transaction to prevent network spam.

I can't really believe that Brian Armstrong is so uninformed about how Bitcoin works that he thinks it's a miner run system rather than miners just solving temporal conflicts.
The author of this article has his own misconceptions which I will assume are just naivety. For example the idea that proof of work time can be shortened securely: it can't, time is basically in the definition of proof of work, it's proof of work over time. 
Generally I like what this author writes though, especially on the fee market question. I think there's a problem with people expecting that low block size will lead to high fees, both from a positive spin or a negative spin: "the fee market being expensive will be a good problem to have", "the fee market has to have a constrained supply for the demand curve to hit it at a revenue generating point", "fees will make Bitcoin so expensive that no one will use the blockchain and it will become insecure and its utility will drop". I don't see fees ever going too high or too low no matter what the block size is, but it's hard to predict something like a far future price very concretely.

Node count is the indicator of success not the end goal. The end goal is that ordinary people who use Bitcoin can make the choice to be decentralized themselves and not depend on a third party like Coinbase etc to manage their coins
The changes that they are making should be very big. A node that used to consume 60 gigs on your hard drive, consuming just a few gigs. A node that took multiple days to accomplish the first sync, syncing in less than a day. 
There's a difference of vision: should you have the ability to be a full member of the network or not. Should Bitcoin be a peer to peer system or should it be a server and client system?

Agreements between companies is not highly centralized, it is normal business. The author attempts to use this word as a dog whistle to rouse anger, no negative consequences are mentioned because the consequences of more off chain transactions always means more room for on chain transactions no matter what


Bitcoin has been penny flooded since the start, Satoshi and Gavin fought against it. In this instance 100% of proper dynamic fee transactions were not affected by the spam attack. I checked every report of problems myself
your lies and these spam attacks just toughen our defenses

Currently, you could try re-spending the change output with a high fee so that the aggregate total was enough to justify block inclusion.

What a crap currency, weird we have more transactions than we know what to do with but if you check out any alt's block explorer they are basically ghost towns


When you wait for a confirmation time, you are waiting for work to be done. Ten minutes is just a mile marker, you aren't at your destination of an expensive to reverse transaction for 3-6 confirmations. The whole point is spending money over time. If you can't just make more mile markers and pretend you are speeding up time somehow


Governance implies control. No one should control Bitcoin, that's the point. Some people have outsized influence amongst their fans, but that's unavoidable in any situation 


This would seem to make no difference to anything. 


Start paying nodes and you just created a new kind of miner


This seems like a privacy win to me. Any number of solutions for Bitcoin usernames mapping to addresses have been invented already though. You can send to an email with Coinbase or Circle. Changetip maps to Reddit names


Bitcoin is scriptable and in that script things like confidential transactions and coin join would be possible, you can coin join right now at So Bitcoin can have best in class privacy functions, plus as someone in the biggest network you can blend in much more easily


You can use payment channels to achieve this, normal ones now, lightning when it is complete. Also, Bitcoin has the advantage of actually being present in some retail environments unlike alts for the most part. Double spends are far less important than people actually having some of the coin

But Core [said](


And you constantly repeat the same demands ad-nauseam, just reworded no matter what Core does:








Increasing capacity is clearly [on the roadmap]( as I have shown. [Core reiterated]( what should have been obvious, they have no relationship to any forum, and that is not their role or their responsibility, nor should they apologize for something they had nothing to do with. Dates [with goals for these features is also offered]( Continuing to harp on about what is already obvious or already present, it's disingenuous. People already told you many times that these things were the case, yet you still present Core as an [intractable]( and [un-listening]( [uncommunicative]( opponent to Bitcoin, instead of some of the only devs who are making meaningful contributions to Bitcoin's short term and long term scalability, which is what in fact they are, and have been for many years now.
Maybe you are acting in good faith, even though every indicator points to the contrary. If so you are just tilting at windmills, The debate has nothing to do with communication skills, and everything to do with control. Core came up with the idea to hard fork to 2mb. [Gavin called it "ridiculous"]( Gavin called for [firing all the developers]( This kind of rhetoric, it represents a fundamental difference in views of Bitcoin that cannot be solved by changing the wording of the roadmap. It can only be solved by people being given the clear facts and then choosing their own way based on a clear portrayal of their choice.

I agree if Bitcoin cannot endure this, it cannot endure what is to come that will be 100x worse. I always knew that the companies like Coinbase and the mining pools would truly be a double edged sword that could hurt Bitcoin as well as help it. However I think it's naive of Core developers who are threatening to quit to think that Bitcoin could be crippled permanently in this way, although maybe it's just their personal decision that they can't divorce themselves from their personal goals to see Bitcoin change for the better quickly. My hope is that this is a trial that pushes on Bitcoin's defenses and strengthens them and Bitcoin quickly heals from it stronger than before, my fear is that this is a trial that opens a lasting wound that festers for years.

Why couldn't it propagate? 100gbit networking exists
Also it's a thought experiment, if the number troubles you instead of 10gb you can think "some large amount of data that requires a high investment to sync"
As the cost grows higher to run a node, fewer people and even fewer businesses will find the benefits justify the cost. This is what centralization looks like
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:08:50
This article makes the following mistakes:
1. "We know that fees + unlimited supply of transactions is sustainable." We don't know that, since miners bid against each other we want fees to go down to the minimum possible fee, if supply is unlimited, what is the minimum amount a fee can be? It could be very close to zero, even if volume is not high.
2. "Transactions will go into limbo if blocks are full and RBF will not help." We don't know the outcome here, there are a lot of solutions, child-pays-for-parent, real time RBF bidding, payment channels, etc.
3. "Ordinary users will be priced out of the blockchain". Imagine 7 billion people trying to sync all of their daily transactions on the blockchain. There would be no way for you to verify the network in that case unless you were a huge company. So there's no way we can instantly jump to any kind of guarantee that unlimited number of users can use the blockchain for free unless it means pushing verification of the blockchain out of the reach of almost everyone.
4. "the transaction fee would need to rise from today’s level of ~$0.08 to: $1.50/$5" - Still better than a wire transfer fee of $45, but totally backwards logic. The hashpower available right now is totally overkill. We don't need to think about how to preserve it. We don't owe it to the miners to protect their investments. Think about this: when the block reward cuts in half, will we have a problem replacing the missing half with fees? No because that is how mining was designed to work: rewards are supposed to drop!
5. "The economic majority favors rash action." This is just a false attempt to group together the fiat exchanges and the miners and call them the economic majority. They don't represent us, they represent their own interests. 
The one point the author is right on is that Classic has no leadership. Its developer commitment consists of the CTO of Cryptsy and a developer who works for him. Even though they condemn Core for having an unclear roadmap, they have no roadmap. Even though they condemn Core for having unclear decision making processes, they have no clear decision making process. Even though they condemn Core for centralizing decision making, they are out there trying to organize the mining pools to make decisions as one central entity.

Yes this would work however Classic won't go for it. A compromise ruined by a polarized debate run by fanatics who have now gone "all in" on winning. On a forum I won't name this was already proposed with the title in all caps "don't give in to core if they try this, we've almost won"

I think it theoretically could be solved the other way, and that maybe was the original idea of the network: if you relay you get fees yourself so don't worry about it. 
If you have to spend $50 a month on your node but you get paid $50 a month in relay fees, maybe that balances out the issue?

There's no need to compromise. The entire "small blocker" narrative is a lie. Everyone endorses the blocks to increasing in size, and SegWit is only the start of that.
What those guys are actually calling for is for the elimination of the Bitcoin Core developers. They want two coins. You cannot compromise with people whose fundamental premise is that they want to not compromise.
Here is what hateful rbtc moderator had to say about keeping a single coin:




They are similar to altcoin developers. They want to create another coin, that will split the market sure, but one they hope to dominate over Bitcoin and replace it. It's not at all about a shared mission or creating a standard money for the world for them.
We can't do anything fast right now because absolutely anything we try will be met with this militant resistance and there is not truly enough actual urgency to risk fast moves. First we will attempt to work with the miners to progress. If they do not want to help we will reformulate our plan to avoid or minimize that dependency. Progress will move forward, maybe at a slowed pace but Bitcoin has made it through much more troubled waters than this.

@_date: 2016-01-12 09:02:20
Two reasons:
1. Anyone with enough capital can make an ASIC, it's solving one hash problem, there's not a lot to it
2. There is a limit to how much more efficient they can become by stealing from regular chip tech, we are quickly approaching the limits of our current miniaturization knowledge.
I estimate in one more doubling of hash power the emphasis will be completely shifted over to energy efficiency, which is tougher to improve. Eventually we'll hit all the walls on that one too and then mining will just purely be an electricity competition
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:14:55
There are two problems with block size for decentralization. 
First: the cost of being decentralized has an impact, it means fewer people take part in the system, which means centralization and the symptom is regulatory attack. For example if nodes are out of reach of everyone except big companies like Apple and Google, that won't really be a decentralized system and those companies will enforce crippling regulatory constraints on people. You can already see this today with Coinbase shutting people's accounts down randomly. If you think people can just use lite clients, that's not stable because they only use miner security and miners can easily be centralized and therefore regulatory attacked. The possibility of switching to full nodes acts as a check on that potential attack.
Second: in theory, miners can carry out out attacks where they manipulate block size to get an advantage. That centralizes things by making fewer miners since not all miners would be in a position to pull it off.

I'd still be careful and diversify your options. One thing I've learned through experience with Coinbase is that they can change the terms of their deal at any moment.

Also never use Coinbase as a wallet or leave your coins on there.

I think that you're not correct about the proof not needing to be stored, except in theoretical very old cases. If my client were offline for a while how would I verify the miners work myself as a node if I couldn't verify the transaction signatures? I would have to trust the miners, that can't be how it works.
Also, the way you are describing is being proposed as the improved way for miners to propagate blocks, with or without SegWit. It's not really part of SegWit itself, it's a complement project to make SegWit feasible. It should be a big optimization in the best case, but we haven't tried it and I don't know if it will actually cause more than a 2x speedup in practice (avoiding having to re-download the transactions you already have in your mempool). Remember the devs (the good ones) aren't thinking about "best case" scenarios where this optimization is in practice, they're also thinking about the "worst case" where the optimization fails and it has to be done the old fashioned way, or blocks come too close together, like a few of them all faster than a minute at a time.

Hosting the network isn't really the point of nodes, the point of them is to give you a trust-less way to receive payments.

You still need to verify all the transactions though because you don't know who to trust to give you a correct hash

Recently I find Gavin's statements to be bewildering, he's been saying full nodes are a fetish and a person doesn't need their own, they can probably just choose from like 12 and that would be enough to keep things decentralized. I think Gavin should lay out what he sees as the point of Bitcoin if it isn't strong decentralization.
@_date: 2016-01-02 11:18:03
I'm saying talk is cheap, if he thinks soft forks should have been hard forks he should have made the changes in his proposed hard fork.
I don't know about Satoshi's stance vs Core, there is plenty of disagreement even amongst Core itself. Satoshi left when Gavin made the decision to go to the CIA (maybe coincidentally), so I don't know if he agreed with Gavin's leadership decisions either.
Historically we've always had soft forks for new features, it's not a new thing. The worst problem I've seen with that method so far has been the possibility for accidental hard-fork. In response to that the soft fork acceptance percentages we see have gone up to like 95%.
Historically we have no planned hard fork to introduce a new feature to point to and say, "this went well", or "we learned this". We have only bug fixing hard forks or emergency hard forks which happened under less than ideal circumstances at times when the network was much less developed

He didn't answer but I think you are right that the key point is that it's an attempt to standardize and package and sync a "for sale" listing and all related metadata
I don't even think the web model is incompatible with this, like if the stuff being synced around is just a package of data about a "for sale" listing, why can't a website potentially serve up that data too?
The biggest question I'm left with is that once you have this no-lock-in marketplace, which is arguably great for merchants because they have no middleman to share profits with, once you have that, how do you get the customers to come knocking? I'm not sure there is an easy answer there because OK you have an advantage for merchants with the no-lock-in story, what is the advantage for customers? Maybe merchants will lower their prices on the bazaar?

Doesn't this post demonstrate that a lot of people just follow Gavin the cult of personality without necessarily independently evaluating his arguments?
10,000 coins sounds like a lot now, but in the past, it was the price of a pizza. And these funds were not mined by Gavin, they were donated to the faucet project - Gavin has said that he mined fewer than 1000 coins himself.
I don't think Gavin gave away 10k coins to decentralize the money supply, I don't remember him saying that. The more likely scenario is that he gave the coins away to promote the project.
Here are [Gavin's words](
) to the other developers on what is more important, decentralization or promoting the project to a wide audience:


One interesting fact about the funds that Gavin gave away, is that he one time he gave the faucet's donated funds directly to mining pools, because they were pissed at him for a controversial fork that he pushed over the objections of other developers that went wrong and resulted in people losing Bitcoin.

Ok I see what you're saying as it relates to zero conf
I don't think it will play out like you say because the guy who is left off the bus is very unlikely to be a normal buyer who cares about zero conf. They will be the first given seats. The first guys who will be kicked off will be the guys who set the lowest fees, people who are just transferring between their own wallets or shuffling funds around, or sending very small amounts and can wait days without a problem.
I think it's inaccurate to say that we don't have that situation yet, try submitting a very tiny fee transaction and see how it goes. Many nodes already have mempool policies against these transactions that will hurt their propagation and many miners already won't bother with them. That's the case today
@_date: 2016-01-10 06:02:26
Pending refers to transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not been included in the Blockchain yet, so that's not related
The blockchain is just a history of all transactions that were ever made, and it has to read from oldest to newest to know which transactions are actually valid. Until it catches up with the present it will not know about anything that happened recently

I'm saying that spam exists, not that it can be easily defined or classified 
Nodes should have a compensation mechanism, or they should be made cheaper: everyone running every single transaction in the world through their personal computers is an idea for the far future, but it's not practical in the near term because of the cost.
If the cost were offset or minimized, there'd be no issue. Generally I don't even mind spam emails too much since my filter can catch them. If it couldn't, email would be pretty lame to use

My node is already the number one consumer of computing resources. A doubling will probably be OK to be fair, but endless increases will move nodes to data centers. Some people suggest it's ok that your node runs on a rented server out of your control, but to me this severely weakens the security guarantees of the system: look how few node operators there are for TOR for example, it's because regulators started to go after them.

I think the best solution would be a separation of components, maybe each with their own repository
1. Reference Wallet
2. Transactions Daemon
3. Miner Daemon
4. Consensus Library
5. BIPs
That way there would no longer be a "Core" there would be these multiple components. If you wanted to change Consensus library, you'd fork that and nothing else. This would be similar to what happened with Web Browsers, where you had pluggable Javascript / Rendering engines etc.

Who posts constantly to mislead people about the Core devs? Not me. I oppose you because you are attacking them in an unfair way, and I of course have no love for people who oppose Bitcoin or try to help its enemies
1. Core can't realize anything because they are not a single organization, they are a bunch of random contributors. If you think they aren't doing enough social work, help them, help another group, or say "oh well" because they owe you nothing and otherwise you are basically demanding they do things but offering no help and no support in return.
2. I just notice this pattern in your actions that indicates you believe money is the end good. Let's say there are two ways to get money, one is to mislead someone into thinking you are selling something they will want: maybe you can get people to buy some time shares or some multilevel marketing crap. That's preying on people's human weaknesses to get money. Another way is to make other people's lives better, by honestly trading something you are good at, for something they are good at, facilitated by money. While both of these things are legal and will get you money, only one is ethical. In both you take home your check, in one you left your morality at the door when you said, "they are adults, let them take their own risks".

The point of the white paper was to show that we should not have financial gatekeepers making decisions and charging rent.

You answered your own question about how to deal with a rising tide: outside networks, like the credit card networks.

There are many other similar solutions, even decentralized ones that don't depend on a single company like Coinbase.

You mean you're not happy that if a person wanted cheaper transactions they would be forced to use a client that supported them? SegWit would give people a choice there. I think SegWit will give you an option to send a cheaper transaction faster than a 2mb hard fork would.

1. On average you will get a confirmation in five minutes. However you might have to wait up to 2 hours. Also you might want to wait for six to ten confirmations for a very solid confidence that the transaction is firmly settled.
2. Currently most wallets will always pay the highest practical fee - some give a slider for the fee. Coinbase even pays the highgest fee for you for free. Do not use blockchaininfo wallet ever. Also don't use Coinbase as a wallet, just send to your other wallet.
3. In theory transactions can be reverted back to yourself, even after confirmed, however it is currently designed to be difficult to do so before a confirmation and extremely difficult after a confirmation.
4. In theory you can re-spend BTC that has not yet confirmed, however not all clients support that and it's not really recommended.
5. Confirmed means the transfer of funds has been entered the history of Bitcoin (just a file of all the previous transactions). It can still leave the history but forcing it to leave the history will grow more and more expensive as time goes by.

In this case it's Coinbase and they are not telling people to not keep their coins at Coinbase or providing a non-custodial wallet. Of course I have no problem with people making that choice, but I don't think that Coinbase's model of Bitcoin where blocks are huge and the wallets are custodial is correct. It loses the basic point of Bitcoin which is to do away with the need for financial middlemen.
If only a limited number of professional companies can afford to run Bitcoin nodes, how soon before regulations come in and permissionless innovation is gone? 
Of course Bitcoin original does exist, what I'm saying is that Coinbase here is pitching a centralized version of Bitcoin that would benefit them: something you need licenses for (they have them already and it will cost their competitors a lot to get), something that you can't run on your own (they provide an easy to use implementation as long as you use them as your financial middleman) and you have no privacy (they spy on every transaction you do, even your private notes).

Really you just need 51% of the miners in the relay network to agree with you - today this can happen with 2 mining pools
I will give you that this is a contrived scenario, but I am trying to make the point that it is difficult to precisely determine what size a block a miner will make, in a non-adversarial situation
@_date: 2016-03-14 12:15:10
I don't know what you are talking about with 12%. Thin blocks don't make blocks bigger, so reducing retransmission isn't a benefit of thin blocks. 
If blocks were 10mb, it could save a maximum of 10mb by pointing out to your client that it already had the 10mb of transactions in the mempool
Upload bandwidth could be greater if you are sending to 8 other nodes, but in theory on average since everyone is uploading, it would also be a savings of 2x, because you are skipping re-sending the same data you just sent.

A UASF would not activate right away, it would require a lead time. During that time, a large effort would be made to ensure that people were on board with the change. A UASF would not be a good idea unless it was trying to bring together the broadest group of people. That's the goal of consensus rule changes like this, to try and be as inclusive as possible.
But at the end of the day, Bitcoin is about you deciding what consensus rules you want for yourself, and ultimately that is the mechanism we are talking about.

The spam attacks never stopped any normal fee transaction from confirming eventually, there is data to prove that.
No one took down the Bitcoin network, people were forced to pay a fee of pennies to sidestep the issue completely.
A fee market is extremely unlikely to make sending Bitcoin around as expensive as existing financial tools.
We want Bitcoin to be decentralized, not centralized. Maybe you mean de-decentralize
Increased node operation cost is only one downside of bigger blocks, there are other more serious problems with bigger blocks
Consensus refers to a term of how the network operates, it's a logical conclusion that there must be consensus, Bitcoin software has no other way to operate
The 75% limit in BitcoinXT refers to the mining hashpower, not to the Bitcoin network.
Gavin was the lead developer for a long time, although he stepped down a couple of years ago.

Not for sure, it depends on the market.

I would change "Bitcoin Core 0.11.2" to "our fork that we publicly show the source for" and then anyone could compare the code there to the version they prefer
Then I'd say, "barring a present or imminent emergency, we will only roll out transaction validation code from releases on our git repository that are at least two weeks old"
That way everyone would get a couple of weeks heads up if Coinbase was planning on changing their definition of Bitcoin and it would still be consistent with XT which gives two weeks notice as well

What about putting forward a statement they could sign off to resolve the conflict, maybe is just talking past you because of his misunderstanding and not willfully twisting the concept of Bitcoin to pretend that miners must have all the power
I think he probably would agree that he doesn't want to see Bitcoin become a hydra of forks and is hoping that a successful hard fork would also not be controversial, but it's difficult to define what is the true side of a fork in an algorithmic-like rule because it's a judgement call

Zero tolerance policies are pretty common in software. It's hard to put in a software algorithm that can account for extenuating circumstances, even in humans that's a challenge.
How gaining a "professional" node is 20x better than gaining an "amateur" node is not explained.
I think the point boils down to what is the point of Bitcoin? Is it a semi-centralized currency based on an agreement between powerful companies, or is it a currency where you can always rest assured that you have the freedom to control your own money? Eliminating amateur nodes and installing "professional" gatekeepers eliminates that freedom, however installing the professional gatekeepers adds more efficiency since these super nodes can be counted on to process more, faster.

When you put attackers in charge of your security, you have no security. Hash power is only security if it is used in a rational way that promotes the health of the system.

Bitcoin isn't made to be decentralized just for the hell of it, it is made to serve the purpose of giving you free access to your own money.
There are two ways to attack this problem: the first is to limit the vulnerability from a centralized weak point. The second is to either remove the benefit of centralization.
With mining centralization
1. We need increased independent verification of miners' work. When miners are independently validated, this limits the amount of damage they can do if they are corrupted from their intended purpose. The more independent validation, the less damage.
2. We need to lower the barriers to entry of being a miner. The fewer barriers to entry the better. Currently miners face tons of barriers to compete effectively: they need tons of capital, they need powerful servers to withstand DDOS attacks, they need cheap electricity, good networking etc. The more of those barriers we can knock down, the lower the benefit of centralization, the more decentralized things will be
With development centralization
1. We need more developers and independent peer review of the existing developers. When all development is done in the clear light of day and everything is carefully scrutinized, analyzed and tested, the number of attacks that are possible by a single developer or a coalition of developers is limited.
2. We need to reduce the burden of Core and make it more modular. In the beginning Core was all powerful, it was everyone's wallet and it was everyone's miner and it was everyone's verifier. This made it hard to improve, so these functions started to split up, that's why we have many wallets now for example. A better design would be interlocking modules of responsibility, this will give developers more of a chance to contribute. To accomplish this, we need more development on Core to help restructure the internal components and build various native libraries so that the breadth of the project can be expanded and not bottlenecked on the efforts of a single team.
@_date: 2016-01-31 13:12:34
A consensus rule is one where everyone is in consensus: everyone agrees. Like "we will never have more than 21 million coins". If you have half of the people with "21" and half the "22", they will stop coexisting when 21 million coins is passed and switch to two separate groups


I guarantee that I spend more than you (since you just buy a pizza every couple weeks and only hold &lt; 5 BTC afaik), more low value and more high value transactions than you. I identify with spenders as much as is possible for a person to do


Bitcoin moving to datacenters as desired by Gavin is not peer to peer. Even a web server can be run on your own computer. This is a destructive vision for Bitcoin that will lead to regulating nodes, coin blacklists (as anticipated by Gavin), and a worthless token when the requirements from financial middleman that are required to use it are more onerous than fiat.

I've done my research thanks, I've been watching Vaultoro closely. There's a trust gap based on available information not on any particular piece of evidence. The thing is with a "bank" type business, its your job to be Caesar's wife, it's not my job to find something wrong. I could point to a lot of risk signals that I see spread out across all of your communications, but I don't want to say point by point there is something broken, just many pieces of a puzzle that point to something that looks too sketchy to trust with someone's life savings.
I want to warn anyone reading that if you wait for the next MTGox to show you clearly that they are untrustworthy, it is probably too late for you to exit unscathed. MTGox said they had full funds, up until they day that they didn't, then it was too late. 
I want to be constructive, so my suggestion for improvement would be to pull back and re-evaluate your communications and decision strategy: consider developing an ethical framework for what your business and brand represents. Trust can always be built. If that framework is good, it will stop the risky indicators from flowing and good trust indicators will flow instead, even if you are a small startup and can never stop those type of "small company" risk indicators from coming. Of course you could go another way, plenty of businesses were built from baling wire and string and never worried too much about how they achieved their goal, best of luck.

Buying into the Dev team is the entire point. I would probably support a 2MB change from the Core devs of course because they would probably suggest a sane way to do it, and have the credibility to support it.
That's also the reason a 2MB HF as being opposed is garbage and will fall apart, as soon as you sacrifice rationality on the altar of the "business interests", you've setup a system where if the "business interests" want to destroy the freedom of the system (they will), they will get to. 
You're also painting a picture that Core does not allow outside contributions of code. Gavin has still been very infrequently committing. There were 45 individual contributors in 2015. Core welcomes outside commits and changes, just not unsafe ones or ones that go against the mission of the system

The most obvious candidate for this is still sticking with ASICs until they are no longer being obsoleted at a rapid pace and their usable lifetimes are sufficiently long that they naturally migrate to those with electricity cost comparative advantage. That should be at least somewhat spread out around the world, although not wholly. What will the ASIC manufacturers do as they see their market become saturated, the limits of smaller process chips reached, and thus their future business prospects diminish? Faced with nothing to lose, a network's friend may turn into a foe as a revenue model is sought to be retained.
On the software side, orphan reducing tech like compact blocks is important, in the long run, to eliminate economies of scale or simple network location advantages that favor centralized actors. Every piece of software that goes into mining is key here, including transaction selection to optimize fee packing. We need more software improvements to make it so that mining can be done by anyone, anywhere, without an absolutely minimal barrier to entry. We should also continue to maintain software like GBT which allows individual hashers to validate what they are hashing and not just blindly leave it up to the pool operator.
It's not a great phrasing to say that miners are voting when it comes to consensus rule changes. What they are doing is signaling future intent. It's a good signal because it's loosely attached to money, which is the basis of Bitcoin's Sybil resistant properties, but it's not a binding vote on the part of the miner and no one else is bound to it either. They may easily be faking or simply be willing to change their mind after the fact.
We've now had both problems with the block side debate as far as mining centralization goes. At first, we had centralization work against XT. If you recall, individual miners went in frustration to P2Pool as no large pool would allow XT signaling. Now we have the flip side of the same coin. I think this should also prove that centralization is a devil's bargain. It can work for you, powerfully and efficiently. But it can also work against you with just as much force. Resisting miner centralization is not just about trying to decentralize them, it is also about limiting the damage they can possibly do if they are centralized.

In a hard fork new blocks generated by the new code might be rejected by the old code.
You are wrong about the difference. It's not "might", it's are. The thing that makes a hard fork a hard fork is that the new blocks are rejected by the nodes not running the hard fork code

That tone changes this from a back and forth discussion to a tirade against another point of view
I favor a more decentralized system where it's easy to use Bitcoin in a trust-less way, and that includes promoting the decentralization of mining and promoting the accessibility of full nodes. I think that is an achievable goal and that there is no immediate threat to it. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:17:32
I think the answer is something like that, because there is something in short supply always which is the next block. In an extreme situation where a miner can include an infinite amount of transactions, there may be the case where normal miners establish a small minimum fee like we have today. The scary part is when a rogue miner comes along and offers super low fees in the hopes of scooping up an underserved market and making more revenue, does he destroy the market of the others? You say that the miners won't work for free, but why wouldn't they start bidding each other down to where they make less in fees, which then means fewer want to spend hash power electricity participate which means hash power goes down during the bidding to the bottom?
I thought well maybe the rogue miner would just be the exception and the normal miners can ignore him and be happy with their fees, but if the good miners turn rogue too they can make more money, so maybe they will do it. Then they all betray each other and they are all making less. Of course miners are thinking so maybe they can see this betrayal situation playing out to every miners disadvantage so they start cooperating as long as the other miner cooperates, since they know the alternative of mutual betrayal will be worse for all. Then their market force is to maximize fee revenue which means maximum price before people start to turn to alternatives, and also a simple enough fee level that they can cooperate on without the dual betrayal scenario.

The assumption built in is that the miners will stick to the consensus rules, block size included. That's why it was considered safe to use SPV because miners wouldn't act outside of those to change the rules because of the full node security model. If this attack succeeds that assumption is proved wrong

This is wrong because it implies that nodes play no role in soft forks. Let's say we soft fork the rules so that every transaction must include "Hail Hydra" in it, and that also signals that the transaction is awarded a free bonus coin in a separate data structure. The devs and miners collaborate on this and no one else can stop it, that much is true. And it's even true that un-updated full nodes will assume that a transaction without "Hail Hydra" is valid even though from the miner perspective it is not. But these un-updated nodes will also not honor the free bonus coin. There's no way to get them to honor it, whereas in a hard fork, you can.
Also soft forks have been in use a long time, without serious objection. Now that it's convenient to a certain narrative, they are the enemy.
I'm hearing the author state that Soft forks are ugly design from an aesthetic point of view, however I don't see where the author points to his qualification to make this judgement or his work on Bitcoin Core. I can just as easily say that hard forks are ugly, ugly and pretty are in the eye of the beholder.
What's most revealing is that the author wants to "Democratize" this process. Even the actual original author of this line of thought has talked about canvassing for support. Bitcoin works through a Voluntary process, it is not a Democratic process. The number of people arrayed against you in a Voluntary process is irrelevant. It gives you maximal freedom of choice and maximal protection from the tyranny of the majority.
@_date: 2016-01-01 03:15:36
The node count is not the important part, we already have plenty. 
The problem is that some people who want to run full nodes won't be able to, or they will find the cost too high. Node count is an indicator, it's not the end goal.
It's like saying it would be nice if everyone brushes their teeth every day. But since 50% of people aren't brushing their teeth, the other 50% should brush their teeth twice as much to make up for it right?

Miners don't get a say is my point, they are not in charge here, what they want or don't want is pointless to consider at all in the grand scheme of things
Decentralized development is a lie, told by people who have no developers to offer, just empty promises. Destroying 1 dev team when you have 0 other dev team would leave you with 0 dev teams not 2 dev teams. It's pretty simple math.
The dominant blockchain is also irrelevant, only the blockchain that maintains the freedom of the money represented is relevant. A bigger more popular blockchain that is not free is useless garbage and won't last.
Blockstream and the developers are our partners in this. They can't change anything we don't explicitly allow them to change, and we can simply stop changing or choose an alternative if they make a change that is out of line with what Bitcoin is.
Because the software is open source, we can make sure that all changes are consistent with the mission of Bitcoin. There is no way that they can threaten us other than to quit or offer bad changes, in which case the solution is the same as the miners: reward betrayal with irrelevance, don't use their software and evaluate other options. 
Just like miners they are free to seek profit in what they do, as long as it does not compromise the mission of Bitcoin, in which case we will stop that change before it happens by simply not using their updated software.

This is wrong, it's full nodes who always enforced. Miners tried a roll back with BIP66 and it did not work because of the full nodes. BU tried a miner driven consensus change and it did not work because of the full nodes.


Full nodes are part of this. Miners have minimal gains by betraying full nodes, if there were no full nodes it would change their incentives.


Definitionally there is more money outside of mining than there is inside of it. 


This is false, and a soft fork can only be more restrictive anyway. It cannot introduce new things that people did not already accept. Miners do not control the consensus rules because they invest a lot of money, it's not even expected that in the long run that miners will have to invest a lot of money.

When you assemble "data" to reach a conclusion by pulling it out of its context or assigning false labels, it loses its objectivity and becomes a subjective argument. It's similar to someone saying: today is cold so global warming must be wrong. Well, you have one data point, that is irrelevant to the actual argument.
Then you pretend like you are just some objective observer and that numbers cannot mislead because they are numbers, that you are open to suggestions to improve your methods even though you just ignore people who point out that your methodology is incorrect and you just carry on as before.
Meanwhile you are cheerleading people who are obviously trying to tear down all of the Core devs, by piling on with accusations that they have mental issues, and when you are told that is out of bounds, you say, no calling other people out in attack threads on them as having mental problems is totally fine. This is quite similar to the non excuse non apology apology/excuse from Classic Founder Olivier Janssens when he says, "sorry I disrespected Islam" after he said that immigrant Muslims were fucking the EU gene pool - in a reply to a thread where the same immigrants were called sandniggers and worse - in a group dedicated to the topic of racism. No, you didn't "disrespect Islam", you were participating in a racist Internet hate group.

If fees continue ever upwards, I'd expect that simple greed for fees would motivate miners to stop dragging their feet and trigger the activation of SegWit to increase their supply of block space by 2x-4x.

I think the debate over XT became so polarized it became hard to separate the facts from the emotion. For example I very much doubt that any Core Dev claimed that they had the right to dictate code to the Bitcoin system and I challenge you to prove that assertion
There's a subtle distinction between a path being one you would choose if given unlimited options, and a path you would go down if some options were not available. In other words, Core on their own wouldn't choose to go to 2mb, but they might not consider it an invalid choice if what they consider a better option was not welcomed.

He didn't say anything like that. You have no proof he said that, there is no backing to that claim, please stop putting words in Satoshi's mouth.
Here is what he actually said:
Jeff Garzik asks:




[Satoshi explains the pricing mechanism](
It ramps up the fee requirement as the block fills up:
&lt;50KB  free
50KB   0.01
250KB  0.02
333KB  0.03
375KB  0.04
It's a typical pricing mechanism.  After the first 50KB sells out, the price is raised to 0.01.  After 250KB is sold, it goes up to 0.02.  At some price, you can pretty much always get in if you're willing to outbid the other customers.
Just including the minimum 0.01 goes a long way.
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:36:03
People have different visions for Bitcoin. Some want to centralize the chain by making it do everything. They argue this will be easy to adapt to and generate tons of fees to keep the chain safe. Some want to decentralize the chain by limiting what it does and keeping it small and well defined. They argue that this will keep Bitcoin accessible and reliable and there can be better ways to transact on top of Bitcoin that can give things like instant transactions. People don't like SegWit because it represents more of the second vision than the first.

The best features in the last year or so were not really network protocol changes but full node operation changes. 
You used to have to get a torrent to bootstrap your full node, they built that functionality into the full node. Full nodes used to have to store 60gb or transaction data, they added a mode to cut that down to just a few GB. There used to be easy ways to spam the memory of your node, maybe crashing your computer: they made that more difficult. There used to be fixed fees where the devs would have to update the fixed fees as the price changed, for example at the height of MTGox price bubble the standard fee was double what it is today. Now the fees dynamically adjust. There used to be a fixed limit for tiny amounts that were considered useless, that also had to be updated by developers and is now dynamic. There was also a buffer overflow security issue that was fixed before it caused any problems.
Coming up next: verification of transactions will be sped up by 7x, this is the main bottleneck to sync a full node: what could take a week will now take a day. Sending transactions with low fees could get stuck in limbo before, there will be a new system to raise a fee that is too low. The graphical wallet used to not support the minimized data set and have to store the full 60GB, it will become compatible with the minimization mode. Transactions used to not have a single identifier which made it very hard to code applications to deal with that, they will have a single unchanging identifier. Transactions used to have a problem where they could be made in an evil way to slow things down disproportionate to their size: even potentially minutes to verify a single transaction, that has been fixed. The scripting system in Bitcoin used to be difficult to change, this will be fixed to make it easier to add potential improvements like confidential transactions that protect your privacy when making transactions. Also there will be the potential for two way pegs between other systems and Bitcoin, letting other systems use Bitcoins coin limit for scarcity in their own systems, eliminating the need for alternative coins to mint their own currency.

This is not so much a question for Core developers as it is for the wider community. Core does not and should not drive consensus, Core is driven by technical needs and goals of Bitcoin which can only be accomplished through a decentralized community of participants.
If a user activated fork makes sense for Core to implement because it is the clearly correct technical solution that also has the support of the community dedicated to the goals of Bitcoin, and people do the work to create a detailed plan that culminates with code, a UASF will be merged into Core.
Currently there is a bug in the miner signaled soft-fork, caused by the faulty assumption that miners will participate to reduce the chances of a hard fork when the community wants to upgrade Bitcoin. By every indication, to a greater degree than has even been before for a soft fork, the greater community supports the SegWit soft fork.
Yet the miners hesitate for their own reasons to cooperate with the network. Miners are playing a dangerous game by faking signaling and not following the majority consensus. Bitcoin is a system where the majority version wins if there's any disagreement, and that can be pretty ugly for the minority version. 
Bitcoin Core does not set policy by dictate of its members, there's never any voting and no option is off the table unless it clearly conflicts with the project goals. Core is an aggregation of a decentralized set of contributors who come to a technical consensus, and that includes everyone including you. You are a key step in this process, any UASF plan must always start with the maximal attempt to find consensus for it as a first step, and driving for consensus is a job that absolutely everyone can participate in.
You should expect for this process to take time. As Bitcoin grows and people build more and more on the bedrock of the Bitcoin consensus standard, finding agreement to change amongst the widest set of people becomes a more challenging and time-consuming task.

I don't think it's fully known yet what level of optimization would be achieved. Also the entire scheme depends on miners working together, maybe some will feel like they have an advantage to keep their lower orphan risk and will not want to help other miners lower theirs?
Another thing that could complicate things is that this is an optimization for mempools being in sync, or close to it. Transactions still need to be published and relayed across the network, that bandwidth and latency is not changed, this optimization would just prevent them from having to be sent a second time. The second time is often more important because it can happen in a racing condition to publish blocks, but that's not 100% of the time
My feeling is that it would lower orphan risk and make the network more decentralized by potentially replacing the relay network, however leaving the relay network should slow things down so it could end up being a wash maybe? Also orphan risk as it compares to block size is even an unknown now because if you look at the historic orphan rate compared to the average block size, block sizes have gone up while orphan rates have stayed flat
Another thing to think about is that at some level miners might want to keep the network looking healthy in node count and they'd cap their blocks at something to make it not so expensive to host a node

1MB is a strawman, I never mentioned that it is the edge or argued it should stay at 1MB forever. In fact, every active developer of Bitcoin thinks that limit can be mutable. So if you trot out that strawman you should know what you are doing by now.
I'm not sure what you are talking about a company making something closed source? Anyone can make a Bitcoin client, they just have to adhere to the common Bitcoin protocol. If they make changes to how they adhere to the protocol they lose compatibility with the other clients. Seems pretty standard to me.

Opt-in RBF is a purely miner decision, only they can decide on that, you can't prevent or revert it. It's not related to the protocol because it can be implemented at any time by any miner with significant hash power and it will change the pseudo-safety of "zero conf" transactions for everyone

They are smart to not publish code, that tactic just reveals the flaws in the plan.
Their biggest weakness is that they have no developers, but that just means the status quo will go on for longer, and established players always love the status quo, that's why it's so hard for Bitcoin to break through. The whole goal of Classic is to keep things the same, avoid the "fee event". So they don't really need code, they actually need coding to stop.

However I agree in principle with this proposal, with certain caveats: no changes that violate the "prohibited list" like fungibility or coin limit. Define supermajority as 95% as soft forks do today.

Blocks mined after couldn't have split the chain because old clients would still accept big block blocks and small block blocks so they would accept both. That means they'd accept whoever is longer, so one would win in the end, it wouldn't be possible for both chains to co-exist.

It can still have implications, for example the other party will have to update their software to be able to see what choice was made, and it may increase the learning curve of how to respond to unconfirmed transactions, which may make it easier to attack people who are still grappling with that learning curve or have not updated their software

I wouldn't worry about a Blocksize increase too too much. There are a lot of efficiencies that have not been grabbed because there is not much in the way of fees to justify it. Hash crashes can also be corrected through a hard fork if it's really very serious. A lot of Bitcoin problems are theoretical and people freak out way too early about them, like fees six months ago were $0.04 and Gavin was posting that we urgently needed a bigger block size, fees at the moment are around $0.05-$0.06, not the biggest deal. With the upcoming Segwit there will also be a doubling of capacity. People love freaking out, but the Bitcoin network just keeps chugging along.

Soft forks are about miner behavior and don't impact Bitcoin nodes except when they expect miners to behave a certain way. The currency stays on a single ledger.

My thinking is that we must already have the fastest possible average right now, so any change must be slower? Like let's say we had a busy few months and some miners went super saiyan and started doing 10x the hashing power. But then there was a drop-off and no one was sending transactions and we went back to 1x. Now for a while we have to wait for the adjustment to happen and during this wait we have to endure some pretty slow blocks

I think there is confusion between what individual Core devs say and how Core as a whole decides things. There is room for people to have different opinions and for them to express them. Maybe they apply these arguments in a pull request or when discussing a feature, but that's part of the process: to hear multiple ideas and viewpoints.


I don't think you're right that no one can contribute something controversial to Bitcoin Core. For example RBF, that was something that was denied for years: FSS RBF, Full RBF etc. Eventually a solution to the objections was found and it made it in.
I haven't seen these features we are missing that are so controversial. I haven't seen these contributions from these outside developers.

According to how Core changes consensus, they don't want to define the consensus rules at all, just go with what is already there or what makes obvious sense to everyone.

The context remains: Gavin or any of us aren't the boss of the Core Devs: _we do not pay them and they did not signal agreement to work for us_.
When you contribute code to Core they don't make you sign a little waiver that says: "You do what Gavin or some other people on the internet tell you to do". Maybe the expectation is there that they do that, but it's a false expectation.
It is true that you could maybe "fire" them in the sense that you can "fire" a customer and tell them to get out of your establishment, but I think the tone and assumptions he's using and promoting are the problem.

I don't want to be put into the position of saying that Core is perfect or has most best and rightest way of doing things. I agree with you that Core could be doing things better, especially when it comes to pragmatic matters.
I do object to the idea of Core as a dictatorship of Bitcoin. Their power is in their influence, nothing more. They make software, tell people about it, that's it. That's not what I call a dictatorship.
I also object to the idea that their actions as a whole are unfair or biased. That kind of a claim requires evidence. Everything I've seen people point to? When I dig in, I always see good reasons for their decision making. Often I have disagreed with them, especially when I was starting out with Bitcoin, only to study the question more and come to the conclusion I was wrong.
The strangest thing is that there is an easy open path to changing the Bitcoin codebase: contribute to it. Coinbase? No code contributions. Miners? No code contributions. Exchanges? No code contributions. This entire debacle reminds me of people raging at a Wikipedia page for being incorrect, but then not being willing to go in and do the work to improve it.

- Bitcoin mining could be seen on the network using a packet sniffer in theory since mining has to sync their mined blocks with the network.
- If you had a lot of mining machines it would make a very hot room, just like any server room would
- The normal local or internet network probably would not possibly be bothered by miners. Miners could slow down the transactions per second rate of the Bitcoin network if there were a lot of them.

Before an increase, there's another step which is to dramatically improve the efficiency and power of signatures through Schnorr. That can be ready fairly quickly but its deployment also is contingent on SegWit. Releases generally can come every few months if uptake is good, much of the code is already written but not yet subjected to the rigorous peer review necessary for a release. The gating factor is that Core seeks to never drive consensus change, as that represents a centralized, ethically and legally problematic position. Instead, Core seeks to craft proposed changes and engage in constructive dialogue towards rational adaptations. The ultimate decision of consensus rule change must come from the decentralized users, not the developers.

SPV only checks a single element of what makes a Bitcoin a Bitcoin, out of hundreds, maybe thousands of elements. You could see yourself receiving Bitcoin in your wallet but actually be receiving something entirely different, not Bitcoin, and you would not know.
If we don't have a decentralized network of people validating that the rules of the system are being followed, it invites people to break the rules. It's like vaccinating: if a few people do not vaccinate, it's still not so easy for diseases to spread. If lots of people don't vaccinate, diseases can spread much more easily.
When you use SPV, you advertise what is in your wallet to other people. And you also hurt the privacy of the people who transact with you. That is because you don't have the entire blockchain so you have to ask other random people about specific parts of the Blockchain, which shows them which are your coins.

Hello and welcome to Bitcoin. 


The miners control a limited resource, transaction space in the blocks. They sell that space, which gives them revenue for as long as people want to make transactions. Currently the fees from selling transaction space are quite high, they could conceivably reach a million dollars a day this year

And if that is what they let you see, you know there is ten times worse behind the scenes that they don't let you see.

Yeah anything except these in the past 12 months:
1. Made it so full nodes [can sync large amounts of block data as fast as a torrent](
1. Made fees floating and not developer set [so the network can automatically withstand spam attacks from large numbers of transactions]( by dynamically making them more expensive
1. Added pruning mode [so that large blocks don't require a large hard drive space commitment](
1.  Added lock time verify to fix problems with payment channels that can potentially [offload millions of transactions from the Blockchain in a trustless way](
1. [Improved transaction validation speed by 700%](
1. Integrated [upload bandwidth limiting]( to make node costs manageable with larger blocks
1. Added [headers block announcement]( to allow pruned nodes to fully participate in block relay
1. Added [max memory limiter]( to prevent large numbers of transactions from taking down full nodes
Plus all the bug and security fixes, packaging and testing, normal feature improvements, etc. And how much did you compensate them for this work that they worked on every day, that they give to everyone for free? I'm guessing you gave them $0?

PoW change should be a weapon of last resort, something that is a reaction to miners abusing their power like not including any transactions at all or something like that. 
PoS doesn't really work at all unfortunately, but we could do another PoW
Miners are currently bootstrapping a process for us where they will create the fastest and most efficient mining hardware possible. Once those can be created easily, they can be spread around to where electricity is free or cheap, and we can start to get better decentralization of mining because the advantage of cheap electricity should be spread very widely in the world.

Can't argue with you there. A transaction does increase the cost to run and use a node and it does increase the centralization of miners, but it also has the benefit of making it easier to use Bitcoin. I don't disagree that it would be nice to have a bit more transactions at this stage, however I do disagree that it is critical to Bitcoin that we don't turn any transactions away.
I also disagree that the fee market hasn't arrived yet because there are already long chains of "full" blocks, and being in the next block would be a premium product. So people could already bid each other up because they wanted to be in the "next" block.

Someone gives you an address, you pay them. From an end user perspective it works pretty much the same as Bitcoin.

It will probably only work for smaller payments, larger payments will have to be sent using normal Bitcoin transactions

There's another aspect which is how peer to peer do we want mining to be? Do we want a setup where it's easy for a minority miner to emerge or are we happy to let some miners get setup with special advantage of large capital and specialized skills? Already we're in a tough spot there, as evidenced by the ironic failure of XT supporters to mine XT blocks. Why they can't mine those blocks? Because p2pool mining is too hard. Why don't XT miners have a normal pool to point their hash power at? Because it's too hard to get a pool going so there aren't many options (too centralized hint hint). I'm pretty sure this irony of the situation is lost on these guys though

I run a node as well - A Bitcoin Core node.
If Bitcoin added 300 million new users, I would of course want them all to have 0 financial middlemen, that's the point of the project: so ideally there would be 300 million new nodes.
This is of course difficult right now, but so is using Bitcoin period, the entire premise is unrealistic. Bitcoin has the promise of having no financial middlemen, if you want you can just throw up your hands and say no that's too hard let's just have it work like PayPal and be centralized and easy ... until you realize PayPal already exists

That's the theory but in practice people want to turn Bitcoin into fiat to buy stuff and they stop you there by demanding to know the source of your funds.

It's Gavin who decided to stop engaging in the discussion. He went to work with Mike Hearn to try and kill Bitcoin Core in a scorched earth unilateral way. has never once tried to compromise or listen to the concerns of any other Bitcoin Core developers, he has always insisted on getting his own way, and called for other developers to "[Leave Bitcoin]( when they did not agree with him


Meanwhile the Core developers held open meetings around the world to discuss possible solutions, where they presented proposals and worked collaboratively. Gavin declined to attend. He also refused to allow feedback or changes on his proposals from anyone except Chinese miners who he allowed to change the limit from 20MB to 8MB for the reason that 8 is a lucky number in China

That's the point of half truths, they sound maybe right if you have drunk the Kool Aid
1. You can't prove a negative, and there is no evidence
2. Again, you can't prove a negative, but the "data" was deliberately misdescribed to promote an agenda. Remember when our mempools were going to explode as we flew off the capacity cliff?
3. Read the white paper which explains why Bitcoin is not a "trust the miners" system. It just doesn't work that way
4. Gavin has literally told core devs to "leave Bitcoin". His project originated the conspiracy theory that Blockstream has a "conflict of interest" that is causing them to constrain the blocksize
These are simple facts, I think you don't want to see the truth, if you deny them it is willfully, and I can't change that. But I can challenge the lies when I see them, and all your bots and sybils won't be able to stop me
@_date: 2016-03-02 12:48:33
Let's say I am a miner and the mempool has 1 BTC of fees in it, however they are spread across 1 GB of transactions - 3 million transactions
Let's say I am able to choose my own block size. What size do I choose? I am connected to the relay network, which compresses transactions to 2 bytes, which means all I have to sync to my peers is 6mb if I include every transaction
Do I choose to make a 1mb block, and take 1/1000th of the possible reward? Do I choose to make a 500mb block and take 1/2 of the reward? Or do I make a 1 GB block and take 100% of the reward?

What you're talking about is not correct 
You can't fool an old client with segwit because it doesn't know how to make a segwit address
The reversion of segwit is also not correct because the same problem would exist for any type of transaction: a hard fork can roll back anything not just segwit 
@_date: 2016-01-14 04:39:25
What version of Electrum do you have? The correct fee depends on market conditions which Electrum should automatically calculate for you if you have the latest version.
If your fee is lower than $0.01 there is a bug somehow. If you want to be safe I would use a fee of around $0.10
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:34:20
That just ignores all the costs of decentralization while focusing only on the benefits. People don't use Visa/Mastercard because they are morons, it's because there are costs to using Bitcoin

Am I assuming the worst about you? I think you have provided a lot of evidence to your two positions I think are incorrect and harmful
1. You consistently oppose all topic moderation, whether it's merely refusing to attend a conference sponsored by people who are suspected as fraudsters (correctly after the fact) or a forum for discussion with clearly defined rules. At the same time you cry censorship: you condemn people for creating a forum as they see fit. That's hypocritical
2. Your approach to selling products is: buyer beware. You said it yourself! You helped sell PayCoin! It's like a corner bodega selling borderline illegal knockoff drugs from China with little regard to their side effects or efficacy at all: if it sells, put it out there, if it's proved illegal pull it back. This removes you from the system, it's like saying, "if I wouldn't sell them this, someone else would" which is a moral fallacy that can be used to justify any number of wrongs. As far as I can tell you have no remorse after you have been proved to be helping with fraudulent schemes, you just throw up your hands and say "I didn't know, I can't do due diligence on everything man"

It's a totally false picture of the world to say that the core devs are making the decisions. They make their own decisions for themselves, just like you can make your own decisions.
They are publishing open source software, and people pay attention to them by free choice, there's no coercion or deception involved. Anyone is free to ignore them and come up with their own alternative.
I don't see suppressing one sided promotions as suppressing discussion. It's one thing to engage in friendly discussion. It's another thing to stand on a chair and shout into a megaphone. Stopping one of those is censorship and another is moderation.

It's only been like 10 days and there is no code or anything, so I wouldn't say it's really even had time to be considered by Core. After there's a release and a proposal, etc, that's when I would say, "What did Core have to say about this idea?"
Generally you know that core wants to increase to 2mb their own way using a soft fork, and they want to do that in a few months. Fees are only like $0.05 so what is the big emergency rush to solve a problem that is just quite theoretical right now?
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:22:43
You'd have to ask them, maybe they like hard forks? There's a small overhead of the soft fork, it uses like three percent more data I think?

The worst part of the BU supporters is their driving for conspiracy theories that a specific group of people who work on Core have an evil conspiracy to harm Bitcoin. It is similar to the Nazis, how they came up with fake stories about the Jews and worked themselves into a frenzy. Just like the Nazis, BU developers have developed propaganda images, derogatory names, and conspiracy theories to throw at Bitcoin Core supporters to incite a hatred of them. I don't think people should have waited until the smoke came out of Auschwitz to realize that the Nazis were on a very dark path.
Luckily in this scenario it is much easier for Bitcoin Core to resist the threats that have been lobbied against us of killing our network or making it "insane for miners to mine Core", as the BU supporters have promised in their vision of a thousand year Reich.

1. I spend money that I earn, and save the rest. I also own shares, I only sell them if I need to, otherwise they stay as savings.
2. Some people want more Bitcoins but they sell because they think the price will dip and they can buy back more later. Some are dipping into their savings. There are lots of reasons people are selling coins and yes for every buyer there is also a seller.
3. Deflation has a bad name because of certain bad situations that can occur when fiat becomes deflationary, but it doesn't apply in what you're saying. Prices of goods won't follow the currency volatility, people aren't going to sell you twice as much just because the currency changed, they are going to re-price continuously as the currency changes. That's why a can of Coke doesn't cost a nickel anymore. Flipside of your logic: if dollars are always getting cheaper then why don't I wait until next year to buy things when all the stuff is cheaper?

1. Makes sense but what prevents technology over time from making the cost of production trend towards zero?
2. Some small percentage toward the tail end of 2 million potential fee slots might have to choose to go into limbo at the end of a bidding war, but it will be self correcting as it is today. Like today we have limbo transactions from people who used tiny fees, the solution for them is either stop doing those tiny fee transaction or to submit using a reasonable transaction fee. By the way this would happen even if there is a natural limit to the block size, like if over a certain size the orphan risk gets too high.
3. When does it stop being a current bottleneck though? Who really defined it as a bottleneck, who is suffering: fees are still within a normal range right? This sounds like the reasoning used to justify Quantitative Easing, like "as soon as the economy springs back, we'll stop using QE". The more temporary stuff we put in today, the more risky Bitcoin is remains because we are delaying getting solutions and answers to questions. 
5. If you can't poll the economic majority, how do you know if you have it? Joinmarket doesn't support this move, Localbitcoins doesn't support this move, tons of companies and users and all the developers are not on board, how do you know they are not the majority?

Why wouldn't miners in Ethereum collude?

I actually use Bitcoin on a day to day basis...


I don't expect that, but that doesn't mean I'm ready to give up on Bitcoin being trust-less. Running a full node is the gold standard. It existing is basically an insurance policy against any trusted solution. If the miners attack the network, your SPV clients will be useless, full nodes will still exist. If Coinbase freezes your funds, you will be out of luck, but full nodes will keep their coins. If your payment processor decides to start crediting you with an Altcoin instead of Bitcoin, you can switch to a full node.
Even the presence of full nodes is deterrence that keeps your low trust ways of using Bitcoin safe. We live in a world where validation is sometimes necessary, and someone needs to be running the software that validates. Who's gonna do it? You? Full nodes have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for low fees going away, and you curse the validators. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That validation, while annoying to use, probably saved the network from death. And full nodes, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, are needed to safeguard the currency.

How do you know what percentage of transactions aren't like that?

Core is bad at manipulative political communication. It has no central command and it has no single agenda.

They get a say as in their feedback is interesting and developers listen to them, but they shouldn't be making technical decisions because their goals are not necessarily the goals of the project and they might not be qualified to make technical determinations.

Hopefully this war doesn't escalate, things seem heated now but there are some lesser talked about weapons that have yet to be deployed in this fight, dangerous weapons that each side would probably prefer to never see used
If nothing happens core will win by default and maybe fees will go up for a while and we'll need some adjustments along the way like fee bidding and mempool policy changes, and we'll see a restructuring of the blockchain with Segwit and how that may lower the fee and transaction pressure, and then we'll see Lightning Network and if that changes anything and then probably some small scale forks over a long time to push the block size or effective block size up.

If Core is working on Bitcoin primarily as a settlement network, why have they been making the speed of transaction verification 7x faster in 0.12, why have they been implementing IBLT + weak blocks to make bigger blocks sync faster, why have they implemented pruning to make it so that you don't need to store the entire blockchain, why have they been pushing the soft limit up, why are they making SegWit to double the possible number of transactions per second, why did they create the relay network to make bigger blocks sync faster, etc?

None of this is accurate, they just strung technical sounding words together to try and mislead people.
First, there's no attack: nothing especially bad happens if the block fills to 4mb. You can tell that from the author himself as he is logically inconsistent, he first says that 4mb is a bad situation then says that the size should grow beyond 4mb.
Second many factors can and would limit size: soft caps, standard rules, mining incentives for the minority.
Third witness data is the least damaging type of data to expand because it does not need to be stored except for archiving, it does not store balance data so it can be checked once and then discarded.

@_date: 2016-01-26 02:42:30
One problem I'm seeing with the current logo is some apps are using the Core logo on their app which is confusing. They call their app Bitcoin Wallet and use the Core logo but they have nothing to do with Core, IMO it's similar to scamming, a lot of people I talk to were fooled into thinking it's a Core wallet. Maybe the logo for Core should be so ugly no one will take it :D

Just don't give in to your cynicism and think I got mine jack, remember that real people's lives are hurt when you make immoral decisions. That is how we arrived at the mess we are in now with the current financial system: bankers trying to make more money and politicians trying to get more lobby dollars to get more powers and just blindly trusting in the system to provide the right result or not caring and cynically laughing at the grandmas without their electricity. Don't fall into that trap, you can be a decent human being and care about more than just some short term cash in your wallet. Even the system can sometimes bite back, don't end up in prison like your boss.

Maybe from a very vague standpoint they are similar, although one is strictly defined in code and one is loosely defined in social decision making.

Bitcoin is not a commercial product to follow the wishes of some random customer. It's an instrument of freedom to allow you to freely own money on your own terms. If miners threaten to stop mining valid blocks for us, we will make them obsolete by changing the PoW, that is our defense. The freedom is what is valuable, not the miners, not the node operators, not the users, they are not relevant. 
There is no censorship, only prevention of spamming a useless centralized miner coin with no developers to con people out of their money through trickery. 
You can follow liars and criminals to a coin that is centralized and useless, with no developers and no lasting value, that is your choice. Just don't try to make me choose such a stupid option, and don't come crying to me when your house of cards falls apart because you fired the developers and burned the safeguards and did it all in service of pure unadulterated greed.

People will make any blocksize fork a problem. The Core developers don't have a magic wand that can make contentiousness go away, they can only make code that tries very hard to prevent Bitcoin from splitting into two coins in a way that damages the network effect utility of Bitcoin.
I would rather never get SegWit than ever use a centralized Roger Ver and Jihan Wu controlled Bitcoin, and there are many who feel the same way. Other people feel differently, and ultimately we should try to separate from them because these views are totally incompatible.

You're right in saying that miners _as a general rule_ aren't so stupid that they will make an altcoin. But it's possible, 80% of the mining power is controlled by 4 people. Bitcoin is not so weak that it can be dictated to by 4 people who are willing to pay the penalty of wasting energy.

Well I am happy to hear you object so strenuously because it indicates you aren't happy with that vision, neither am I
If you prefer, just imagine it then as a potential vision. I have heard the claims of data-centers directly from the founders, so I would just agree to disagree about that. 
You're right about the 2MB limit being simply code, I'm not too interested in that aspect of it, I've always thought that blocks should increase in size, and a 2MB hard fork as long as it is done responsibly (unlike this one) would be fine with me. What matters to me more though is that I want to support the best long term vision for Bitcoin, and the datacenter vision is not one that I think is worth supporting. So we agree, yay.
@_date: 2016-01-16 05:00:03
If it's only 1mb, it's not that hard to keep a large number of nodes in sync with 1mb per 10 minutes. It would be a nightmare at 8000mb. Also this assumes a static system, we can make improvements so that full nodes are not necessary for trustlessness

It's been an urgent non problem since Jeff Garzik first described it to Satoshi and got shot down by him years ago.

Someone must have reported him to the admins, I'm sure they don't read every post
I think double spending is getting easier with full blocks: you can't just look for an obvious tell like zero fee or dust, now you need to look at the market prevailing fee.
Miners should come up with a new system where they sell the information of what transactions they will include in their next blocks. That would give a better idea of what transactions will really get confirmations than this guesswork
@_date: 2016-01-30 10:49:46
People are yelling that fees are too high, when they are normal. People are proposing urgent fixes like a hard fork that triggers after a handful of weeks to solve a problem that is clearly not urgent.

I think we need two types of mempools: keep everything mempools (miners, payment processors) and just relay mempools (enthusiasts). 
Right now we have a design where not only are all blocks in sync, we also try to have all mempools in sync. That means if you are able to spam one to get it to evict good transactions, you are able to spam all to get them to evict good transactions because they will rebroadcast and decide what to keep with similar algorithms.
Disk is a problem for enthusiasts because you can now really get a lot more bang for your buck by spamming, disk is so much slower that new classes of attacks that really mess with people's computers become possible, memory limiting really makes the scope of an attack limited. And in a relay node, why would they have to hold all the transactions anyway?
This is tricky to design though because how can a developer of Bitcoin decide what a miner should be running? Their memory pool selection is up to them. So it's all just a best practice hopeful suggestion. 
I do hope we can figure out something a bit more concrete than this because I don't want people to build a lot on best practices and then set ourselves up for failure when people don't do the stuff right and we depend on them doing it right 
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:56:35
The way the article is written is from an incorrect basis that Core is an organization that makes a product for you to consume. It's not, it's a grouping of volunteers who are working on the project, they don't speak with one voice - that's pretty obvious when you consider that Gavin and Jeff are at least ostensibly part of Core!
If you listen to the individuals then, you can hear that they are not convinced of the urgency of making changes because fees now are like five cents and their plan of action will double the capacity of the blockchain pretty quickly. 
Furthermore they have said that they would consider high fees to be an urgent situation where we should try to address it as a big problem. That's not to say the block size is the only solution though, a good new alternative way to send bitcoins can relieve pressure on the blockchain as well. I've heard them describe a very high fee as $1-5 - I think $10 would be a big big deal for them (although they don't have an organizational element that decides this).
If you really want to help with this problem, help out the wallet devs. As soon as they can support Segwit, we can have double capacity, no hard fork necessary
@_date: 2016-01-26 03:54:42
I think some of the Bitcoin detractors have switched their accounts over to try to play up the divide for the fun of it
Consider what is being said
1. Bitcoin can't be mainstream and extremely decentralized because if the number of transactions gets too high only businesses will be able to afford to run a node
2. Bitcoin is entirely controlled by the miners since the longest chain always wins
3. Bitcoin can never be used by real people because once you submit a transaction to the network you are just gambling someone will accept your transaction fee and you have no way to change it
Are those buttcoin points or classic points? You can't tell the difference

The process is that code that makes sense goes in, and decisions are made based on discussions of what is obviously good to add. When the core devs disagree or want something that isn't in the core version, they make side versions and distribute those, there are at least three side versions like that. 
Core is just one distribution, it's open source so there is room for many versions to suit people's needs. Miners also run their own private custom versions

The reason I think this is because he's told the same story multiple different conflicting ways, he is careful to lead you to a conclusion but not say it, and he will never correct anyone who read his story in ways that are obviously false, like "Satoshi gave Gavin the github keys" (Satoshi did not have a github account)

The end goal is not really to run a full node, it's to let people have access to their money without interference. Full nodes are currently the best tool to let you accomplish that, and access without interference is just another way of saying "decentralized".
As an analogy, why do we want free speech? Well we want it because we want it, it's a goal unto itself: we want the ability to express ourselves without interference. You might measure free speech in "books published", but that's not really a direct measurement because North Koreans might just publish 50 billion books to say they have the most free speech.
So full nodes are not the end goal, they are just the best tool to achieve it we have at the moment. You're right it's only one factor, but there is a very wide gap between a full node and a lite-client at the moment. Another way we could provide decentralization is by closing that gap.

What Gavin is saying now is that it doesn't matter what Bitcoin Core does, we need anything but them. That's why he said "decentralize all the things" "we need more teams than Bitcoin Core".
Basically Gavin is saying that Bitcoin Core has betrayed the concept of open source and won't allow other developers to join in and has centralized too much around specific individuals. 
Bitcoin Classic only has 2 changes: remove the Bitcoin Core team and hard fork (to 2mb). The replacement of the team of course implies that more changes will come, but those are unspecified.

SegWit was pushed to release but the original release plan ran into some issues so there is a new plan in progress to kick off SegWit in August. It's called the UASF

When SegWit activates and they start using Electrum's SegWit support, they will start to use 3xx addresses instead of 1xx addresses if they aren't already because they use an Electrum multisig wallet.
Eventually they will switch again to bc1* addresses as support for the new SegWit address type becomes more fully supported.
Electrum doesn't have LN support yet but it would pretty much look the same, except that you would pay to a LN "address" instead, and you may want to decide how much of your coins you want to put in LN, potentially just a spending amount.

If you're new to Bitcoin you should read up on confirmations, until you have them your funds are pending a send but have not actually moved. You should expect to wait up to around two hours for a confirmation, although the average is ten minutes. The recommendation is also to wait for six confirmations because the number of confirmations can go down as well as up

Yeah it could happen, but that creates new trust issues. For example Bitcoin was able to build a lot of merchant services to bypass the "0 conf" issue by having "0 conf detection as a service". But what this also does is centralize the network: now instead of having thousands of independent merchants with their own independent voices, we have BitPay and Coinbase who speak for them without even asking them their opinion. The goal of the system is to reduce required trust, so adding required trust could be considered against the overall goal.

The main use case for RBF is if fees are too high and your transaction might get stuck. But right now that's not a big problem, even with very dedicated spamming the fees never rose above $0.07-08 which is pretty affordable. So in my view there is no reason for an on/off control, at this time.
As far as receiving funds go, users should be reminded that no unconfirmed transaction is safe, for any important amount of money from an untrusted source you should always wait for confirmations.
I don't think SPV wallets should be used at all at the moment to receive from untrusted sources, even with confirmations. The lack of verification makes it unsafe.

It's like saying that no one ever makes bad decisions because why would they, the outcome is bad. They can make a mistake or slip up or be coerced, etc.
So you do admit that there would be a time where the longest chain would have 42 million coins I guess. And by Coinbase's statement they would support this. So you could be a merchant on Coinbase and someone submits to you a transaction on the "longest" chain (the 42 million coin chain) to buy a new car. You give him the car since Coinbase tells you it's fine, but then the network decides the "longest" chain back to the 21 million coin after a while due to economic self correcting as you say. BTW the guy also did a double spend on the shorter chain back to himself, so now the merchant just gave away a free car, doh...

That's what we're talking about: Mike Hearn is saying that the concern about SegWit is technical debt right. XT says it wants to install Hearn as the dictator of Bitcoin's implementation and that people should no longer use Core at all. So why does XT not really change anything other than block size and keep folding in other changes from Core, without contributing any new features or improvements of its own, nor "fixing" any of the technical debt from previous soft forks. I'm not really surprised since Mike and Gavin have pretty much abandoned the project and none of the Core devs ever joined them to help code.
@_date: 2016-01-10 05:51:35
Fund transfers in Bitcoin occur on the distributed blockchain, not on your individual client, so it's likely the transfer has already occurred.
Full blockchain verifying Bitcoin wallets like mSIGNA fully download and verify every single transaction in Bitcoin's history, which takes a long time due to the millions of historical transactions to verify. So you probably have the funds already, you just can't see them yet because your wallet has not caught up to that point in history

My take on these questions. I think Adam Back had the best general idea for a question which is what is the priority order of Bitcoin: Scalability, Reliability, Peer to Peer? Not everyone agrees about the order, for me it would be P2P, Reliability, Scalability. 


Bitcoins are designed as a currency token, like poker chips. They are given value based on their properties and the people who are committed to using them and improving the system. Values flow out of many various things in various proportions: speculation, store of value, medium of exchange, hobby interest, etc.


Bitcoin can be used as a settlement layer, it's not its only use case but it's a very narrow use case that should be one of the more reliable ones because of its narrow requirements set.


Yes, for some users. There are many users of Bitcoin who only use what are called SPV clients, these clients do not check rules like the 21M cap and they can be forced into increasing the 21M cap. However SPV users can also switch their software to a different client that is not vulnerable to this issue.


Theoretically anything could happen via a soft fork, although not purely through a soft fork, users would also have to be complicit in a change. So a hard fork will never be necessary, however at some point it might be the best option on the table.


After 2024 we should hope to see fees starting to carry some of the reward burden, but it will take 100 years for the rewards to disappear completely and the miners depend absolutely on fees.


There is no clear answer to how exactly fees can pay for Bitcoin security. In general it's thought that we can use the fee mechanism to provide for security but the details of how we do that are not clear.


The goal of Bitcoin is to provide a money networking layer. I don't see any specific road there, because there is no central coordinating force guiding us along a path. We just have to fix problems as they come along and hope that people who work with Bitcoins can make money for themselves and improve Bitcoin for end users at the same time.

I think it's interesting that there may soon be a more devious way to pull off the same sort of attack that would be possible with opt-in RBF. Just because opt-in RBF isn't safe to accept, does not make non opt-in RBF safe to accept.
This hasn't been getting as much play, except by Luke jr maybe, but very low fee transactions are becoming very much less reliable to be included in a block than they used to be, through a combination of miner policy changes and blocks filling up. So to steal your coffee from a trusting merchant, just send a super low fee transaction, and let the miners never pick it up. In this case you can even have the plausible deniability that you didn't know what happened, vs RBF where you obviously did a double spend back to yourself. It will probably be much easier to send these super low fee transactions as well, I can't imagine many mobile wallets being written to make it easy for you to abuse RBF to steal from merchants, whereas a mobile wallet might easily let you pick your own fee.
@_date: 2016-01-31 15:30:11
Just buy a little coins on changetip or circle and use them to replenish back to your desired balance. 
Yes use a fee, the blockchain is a shared resource, it helps prioritize transactions if you include a fee. A zero fee means no importance and may be ignored by miners or relay nodes, although there still may be pools that include priority space. 
You can't lose coins by being stuck, eventually the network will mostly forget about your low fee transaction and the coins will never move.
@_date: 2016-01-14 09:27:59
Two competing sets of consensus rules is not possible, since the meaning of the word consensus means no competition. To quote Satoshi: "I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.". Either we have N coins or we "centralize" on a single implementation of the consensus logic. This centralization is not bad if we keep the consensus implementation open source, limited in scope, patent unencumbered and in the hands of a dev team that welcomes participation.
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:20:55
It depends on the central server and the mining dynamic. You might have an exceedingly trustworthy central server that also had a lot to lose by defrauding you, versus a mining majority that had very little to lose by defrauding you. Full nodes are a good way to side-step and safeguard against those less-than-ideal situations.

The criteria is relay improvements, fraud proofs, dynamic block size logic, or anything else that mitigates the risk and problems associated with larger blocks:


block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them.
Even in Classic's roadmap they aren't jumping to unlimited block size right away. Even Gavin backed off of BIP 101 when jtoomim tests proved it was dangerous. Scalability is not just a single variable.

My point is that Classic is tapping into a channel of rage, the source of its power is not the strength of it's code or concept, but the pent of frustrations of an angry mob.
That thirst won't be easily quenched by reasonable conciliation, although maybe there are enough reasonable people who actually are the ones doing things rather than the ones shouting things to listen and create a true compromise. In the end, Core's claim is best because they say they do listen and collaborate. Not collaborating with the best ideas would just mean Core's opponents were right all along, which is something I don't happen to think is supported by the available evidence.

It's correct to be skeptical of fantastic claims. Bitcoin does not automatically solve all problems because Satoshi was a prophet. Incentives are not magic.

Lots of bogus nonsense here.


No, there's nothing particularly artificial here. Artificial means man made: unless you think Satoshi is Mother Gaia, it's all artificial.
They love flawed analogies, at least instead of bus he chose a taxi:


People demand rides, Bitcoin has rides through payment channels and offchain transactions as well as on chain. The only people who care that every single possible transaction in the world ends up always and only on the Blockchain are big blocker psychopaths.


Misinformation: False history: miners stopped using priority themselves long before they hit 1 mb.
 Why would they want to do something they are very weakly incentivized to do? Talk about an artificial market...


Users don't require blockspace. They require transactions. Those can occur on chain or off chain. No user says, "I need some block space". That is not a user goal. Users want to pay for things, to store wealth, etc. As Bitcoin grows, it needs to specialize those use cases: create different tools for different jobs. Every single penny from every single person in the world going on the Blockchain is just wasteful and unnecessary and the people who obsess over that are just irrationally desiring it with no justification other than a Luddite desire to see technological progress die and have Bitcoin stay the same and never ever specialize and improve.

I don't think everyone on your side understands or shares your view that this is weird. However I do think this view is consistent with what Gavin is selling. From my perspective a data center Bitcoin makes no sense. Also I think your interpretation of what Satoshi's idea is is too literal, the general idea was never a centralized Bitcoin, it was always a peer to peer Bitcoin.


What does scale on-chain mean?


What economic concerns have been raised? So far just the fee event and their solution is almost identical to the 2MB HF solution.


A consensus rule can't have competition by definition. You can't have people agree to disagree within a consensus, everyone agrees to the consensus rules or people leave.

Bitcoin is money - people send it around to each other to pay for things and the program keeps track of who sent what to whom. To avoid people spending the same thing in two places and to help people convert real world value into digital value, there's a process called mining in which electricity can be provably expended to verify that the record of transactions is legitimate and that someone trying to publish multiple conflicting records could only do that at great personal cost to themselves, making that more predictably unlikely.

The network creates a history of transactions, with the right to add to this history belonging to "miners" who add to the history in acceptable ways. Miners mint the money and then trade it to other people, who then trade it along further. Miners compete add to the history through an open challenge, on average every 10 minutes there is a new challenge. People submit their transactions to miners, and optionally include a small reward to the miners to encourage them to add it to the history.

Bigger blocks give more advantage to non hash power factors. The farther we get from pure electricity spend the more opportunity there is for central locations and central companies to have economies of scale that let them outcompete their competition 
Another problem is potential attacks where you send around a big block that you think some of your mining competition will have trouble validating because it's so large. If they have trouble, it means more profit for you. We'd only see this in a worst case situation where miners were playing dirty to win, but it could happen

@_date: 2016-01-14 05:39:57
I think things would have gone a lot differently if the block size advocates started with 2mb instead of 20mb. Segwit itself is essentially a raise to 2mb, Core devs think that they can implement things in the near term to safely make that raise.
Back in May posted: "Increasing the max block size is urgent", and then implemented a huge increase to block size (8000 times the current size) that he later admitted was overly aggressive, which is why he backed down in size one time and now this second time. This recent replacement for XT is better because it was created by someone who actually asked the miners first what they wanted, since miners emphatically didn't want XT.
But because Gavin made a blog post post "this is urgent", essentially cutting off communication with the Devs and making a direct appeal to users, he polarized the debate. Before this blog post, almost everyone was already advocating for a block size increase, only a small number were singing the praises of a smaller or static block size.
Gavin's false urgency has ironically slowed down the pace of the block size increase because it's turned the whole issue into a deadlocked political football, how can you take him seriously when he now can't even endorse a single plan and all the while he's yelling about the sky falling tomorrow for the past nine months when fees are only 1 penny more than they were when they were lowered from ten cents to the current level?
The tone of this discussion needs to be changed to one of exchanging ideas and being on the same team against fiat, not one where the other side will literally destroy Bitcoin if they are allowed to win.

Yes but your mission doesn't include a point other than "promote Bitcoin". What is it you're promoting exactly, just the brand name Bitcoin? It doesn't say what Bitcoin should be used for, what Bitcoin accomplishes.

I'm not sure what the answer here is but if there is an infinitely increasing supply of something, shouldn't the price and even total revenue be ever shrinking? For example there is so much air we don't charge for it, there's too much supply for there to be a demand even though we need air to live.
In a normal market that's great, everyone has all they need. In Bitcoin it would mean transaction fees would trend towards zero, sounds good so far. However after the block rewards are gone, if fees are going toward zero and miner revenues are going towards zero, how do we pay the hash power to secure the network? I'm not sure of the answer here, although I think there is one
@_date: 2016-01-17 09:00:39
The mempool should be able to drop some transactions somehow, a 2mb block size just improves that situation by 2x, you still have the same problem, just to a lesser degree because of faster reduction of the mempool size (assuming miners actually use the entire space)


So in your situation we have a world where blocks are full for stretches of at least days, since that's how long a transaction can take to be ignored and go into purgatory
So you submit a transaction with a fee of "average", which I'm assuming in the 0-12h territory. 
Now you say that the average fee is steadily increasing, so you fee slips from 0-12h down to 12-24h and then down to 24-48 and then gone. That is a very volatile fee. Also we live in a world where Child-Pays-For-Parent is possible and the merchant could rescue the transaction himself.
I think what you are saying is possible, but I don't see it as the probable outcome, at least initially

1. Miner activation is still the best and should be a part of a UASF
2. If we want to lower the threshold of miner activation we need to be sure that the rest of the network will enforce and we won't have a shit show

My problem with this whole scheme is that it is really hinged on a bigger blocksize and a future where the block chain is still used for everyday transactions
It's very possible we'll go in a direction where only a tiny minority of transactions hit the blockchain. You could say this is already happening in situations like coinbase and the exchanges where many "transactions" are never using the blockchain
In a tiny minority future, are the mining rewards really a lot of money or are these future African sun miners stuck with a few pennies a day for their sun farm?

How would you suppose that capacity improvements would continue to happen when the developers leave? The Classic solution has no answer to that as far as I can tell. It will also delay other real potential scalability improvements like the Lightning Network and other improvements like SegWit and fungibility improvements like Confidential Transactions.
Bitcoin does not "Break" with full blocks. If it would, then a 2MB block size would break almost as easily as a 1MB block size, just spend 2X the effort breaking it. So it's not a real solution by any stretch of the imagination.
In your development experience, have you ever rolled something out that left thousands of customers with broken software, with a month's notice, with major implications on the system forcing them to make a choice of development teams, on purpose?

Unfortunately we have huge threats to Bitcoin's stability. Deep pocketed individuals funding divisive campaigns, leveraging wedge issues and personality conflicts.
Strange thing about so-called "big blockers", they refuse to even try layer 2 scalability solutions. Lightning Network usable alphas have been available for a month now, they've said nothing and they very clearly have never used the alphas and are not interested in participating or helping solve malleability at all, in fact they see solving malleability before making a block size change as a serious political problem. So the supposed "scalability" concerned people, what are they really concerned about?

I would hate to see Bitcoin centralized to such a degree where there were only a few big server farms running Bitcoin. I think there are two important points to nodes:
1. If the network comes under concentrated attack, full nodes can be so distributed, cheap and widespread that the network cannot be crushed.
2. If the network is attacked by insidious methods that corrupt the sources of information or target people who own Bitcoins, full nodes are resistant to invalid information and obscure the ownership of coins.
So far, full nodes are the best and pretty much only tool we have to achieve those goals. That's why now more than ever it is critical that people use a Bitcoin Core full node, for their own protection and for the durability of Bitcoin against attack.

You're misunderstanding then, the developers have said that combining the two would delay Segwit. Adam has said this too.

I think Core thinks that they did increase the block size (the one point), as seen through the SegWit increase. I agree with them, I think it's reasonable that a person could disagree with the way they proposed it, but they have been working on a similar idea.
The high level point though is that Core has their priorities and values and they are building a product to their priorities. If other people have a different set of priorities and values, instead of demanding that Core listen to what they want, they should either contribute and become the dominant coders or just build a new team

The Bitcoin miners have less of an incentive to spam their own blocks in order to vote for bigger blocks.
Here's a simple example: I'm a miner and I make more money from transaction fees. More transactions in a block, more fees for me. It costs me nothing to spam transactions in my own block. If blocks are bigger, I can potentially make more in transaction fees. So spamming my own blocks now is the obvious move: it has no downside and a possible upside: more money for me.

Adding centralized checkpoints and making it so that only a centralized set of people can use Bitcoin is a threat to bitcoin's survival.

Every service should start providing continuous guidance on what they will do in the event of any fork.
In this case you should retroactively say that it is reasonable to assume that people should have been operating under the understanding that the current rule set is what is referred to as Bitcoin and not some arbitrary other piece of software that happens to credit altcoins for Bitcoins. Then do what makes most business sense for you with the altcoins: sell them and take the profit for yourselves if you prefer.
You can then publish clearer guidelines for the future. I hope you publish something that represents a low business cost to you: we want Bitcoin ultimately to be cheaper, simpler, and more dependable than fiat, worrying about forks excessively harms that goal from both the customer and merchant side.

Parallel validation doesn't really make sense if you just want more capacity.
Validating two new blocks in parallel and choosing the one that finished validating first means that miners are incentivized to not put too many transactions in their blocks, so that they can always win in a race.
Meanwhile you still have the DOS on the rest of the nodes by an attacker who doesn't care about winning an individual mining race and just wants to DOS the network.

Thanks for the explanation about your relationship with Bitcoin because it explains that the stakes for you are a lot different than the stakes for me.
Finding consensus is not supposed to look like a war with attacks on both sides. Personally I think consensus is impossible in the long term because Gavin's vision of a datacenter Bitcoin is too fundamentally different from Core's vision of everyone fully validating, the gap of opinion on the subject is too wide.
I think the battle is happening because when you have two different ideas of what Bitcoin should be, who gets to decide? Is it like Gavin says and you can push out the enthusiasts with the  support of the Bitcoin VC funded startups and fiat exchanges and mining companies? I'm not sure

ASIC manufacturers currently have an incentive problem where they are not incentivized to sell their miners. This can lead to these manufacturers threatening 51% attacks.

I hadn't really considered it before, but the problem I see is that the average time to find a block would go up. That sounds less predictable, you then have to hope you are submitting your transaction at a busy time so it will ride along with the others in a quick block
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:51:39
If the fee market is so well figured out, why do we still need the block reward? Can you explain how the fee market works just clearly? To me it seems like a miner would add transactions of any fee into his block up to the limit. The miner would then calculate if he was making money doing that, and if not he would shut down his miner. If there were no limit he'd take every fee (regardless of mining difficulty), which seems to eliminate the point of even putting a fee far above zero

I think that's why merchants never price things in Bitcoin, it's too volatile.
The volatility of Bitcoin is just a symptom of it being small, all small currencies are volatile. It's also a symptom of the dollar being stable that prices don't change too much, if the dollar were changing more rapidly, prices would be changing more rapidly.
The goal of Bitcoin is not to rise and rise, it's to stay flat (relative to value, but rise relative to inflationary things). Rise and rise is just something that happened because it is a new project, not because there was an intent for that to be something that is always a part of Bitcoin.

Of course due to thermodynamics, but it's not that simple as conservation of energy. As a simplified example, a purpose built heater can radiate heat in your direction whereas a random electricity dump could be dumping it in every direction including the floor where you are wasting money heating the ground.

I think it will have a slow uptake because I think the fees won't get high as you suggest. If they did get high, I think it would have a fast uptake. So in the continuing low fees case, 2mb doesn't help because we have low fees so 2mb is not really important. In the fast high fees case, 2mb doesn't help because users demand wallets implement segwit and it gets rolled out fast.

Slippery slope refers to a logical fallacy that says one step must definitely lead to another without explaining why, it can't be valid, it's a fallacy.
How you would turn it not into a fallacy might be to suggest that eventually all wallets would include RBF as a matter of course to participate in fee bidding wars to achieve the lowest fees possible for the desired block placement. In that case merchants would move towards never trusting unconfirmed transactions due to the lack of non opt-in RBF transactions and complexity cost of supporting both types and thus opt-in would be made superfluous.

Of course we already have a centralized system that has a huge user base: fiat. Let's say the UN said that Bitcoin was now the world's currency and all the countries agreed, however they changed the definition of Bitcoin to mean some kind of super fiat controlled by the UN, like the Euro.

I don't fault him for that, this conspiracy stuff really came from Mike Hearn (who has abandoned XT and Bitcoin), and we just hear the echoes of it now. People fear new things or things they don't understand, it was easy for Mike to play upon that fear and work up the crowd to hate the big bad.
So far I've actually seen Gavin praise the work of Core developers for the most part, although he chastised Greg for being "too negative" and he plays the victim card when people forcefully object to his "don't be afraid to be wrong" type proposals. 
In general I think Gavin is just a bit lost on what his "post developer" role should be. I wish he would go back to working on toolchain standards like his unfinished payment protocol project, maybe he feels that is beneath him?

When a miner broadcasts his block solution, he wants the solution to propagate widely, so that the other miners start building on top of it. But after he gets the block to 51% of the miners, he actually now wants the solution to slow down, so that the 49% who are his competition waste time building on useless blocks. It's important to think about the implications of propagation in that context: can miners selectively use a system to game their competition? If they can, how obvious is it? 


Try and get someone to explain why. If someone can't explain something complicated in simple terms, it's a good sign they don't really understand it. SegWit as a hard fork saves a very minimal amount of space, like 1%. Every other big change to transactions like p2sh has been done as a soft fork. There are no devs working on a SegWit hf. If there are some significant advantages, I haven't heard them.


Avoiding controversy is hard when everyone has an opinion. Peter Wuille already proposed a similar plan and it was nixed. Adam Back first proposed a 2mb plan and it was shut down. There is very broad support to increase the block size, including from myself, but there is no agreement as to the appropriate way to do it.
Personally, I think it will take much longer to find a general agreement about numbers and rollout plan and timing than it will to roll out a soft fork. Like you say, some people disagree with SegWit, but that is fine it doesn't matter to the rollout that people disagree.


After CSV activates, the HF will be vaporware too, unless the hf patches are adjusted to support it. Otherwise activating them will risk people's funds locked in CSV. 
Definitive rapid ultimatum type upgrades are discouraged in software best practices. It's very rare for any software project, commercial or open source, to tell users that their software will break in a month. This imposes a big burden on the user, they are living their lives, they are busy, they need time to adapt and evaluate. A month warning forced upgrade would be extremely disruptive to people. If you look at the node counts, only a small shrinking minority support flexible block sizes or bigger block sizes. That's a big majority of the users to disrupt 


I'm the kind of competitor where I want to not look behind me as I run, but just to concentrate on running my best race. If eth wins, I'm even fine with that, it means that the world has a cryptocurrency that did better, that is better. I don't think that fighting or competition is appropriate because we are really on a charitable mission to bring human rights to the world. Amnesty international doesn't get pissed that another group is doing better, although they might be pissed at groups are raising cash and then spending it on themselves instead of their supposed missions.


We just saw this happen, and the guy raising money exit scammed and ran off with the funds. But decentralization can't be built that way, it needs to be organic and distributed, people need to really run nodes and really use them, or the effect is hollow, you can't have centralized decentralization, it's just a contradiction in terms. 
That being said, I would love it if the problem were attacked this way. If efforts were made to make decentralization so widespread that it was easy to recognize we had a safety margin to work with. That would really help convince people that protecting decentralization was not as critical

If people could choose to accept an inflationary currency or a deflationary currency, why would they choose an inflationary one?
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:25:36
Normal currency isn't confined a single system, we use it as a unit of account across many systems. Gold was used this way as well before it yielded to fiat.
Why are the limitations of the Blockchain system even relevant to the end goal of Bitcoin?


My take on this is that there are two goals: Bitcoin as gold, then Bitcoin as currency.
Bitcoin as gold is the idea that Bitcoin can be used as a store of value, which is critical anyway for its use as a trading currency: if we want this currency to be stable for trading purposes, volatility must be minimized by definition.
But also Bitcoin would serve an excellent utility if it were able to store value even with minimal trading, as we see with gold. So Bitcoin as gold has 2 distinct and sequential goals, first win: become gold, second win: become a superior type of gold that is also used as currency
A Bitcoin as currency viewpoint would say that Bitcoin as gold makes no sense, because if people don't use it as a currency, then it has no value. Again the counter-argument to that is that gold itself is not used as a currency very often.

Past a certain block size, I won't be able to use Bitcoin trustlessly because the expense would be too great

Don't ever use Coinbase to send Bitcoin to anyone other than yourself
It looks like you are sending to a Chinese recipient. Sometimes even email can be blocked by the Chinese Great Firewall. I would contact Coinbase to see if you can take back the transaction if it has not been claimed, or to get the transaction information to prove that you sent it if it has been claimed. 
If you can get the transaction back, ask the recipient to download a Bitcoin Wallet like Electrum and give you a Bitcoin address to send to instead
Also never keep your Bitcoin on Coinbase

Fees and security will match potential usage and speed

@_date: 2016-06-07 08:33:00
Great although with soft forks the security is also very dependent on the network as a whole adopting it. I still have plenty of nodes connected to me on old versions like 0.11 and 0.12 - it is not a great idea to start using soft fork features until a good consensus around the soft fork has been formed.
Gotta get the word out to the node operators too, get with the program, CSV will really help with micro-payments, hopefully the consensus forms around it quickly

It's something that needs work to address, we're still using the same quick and dirty system that Satoshi put together in the very early days all those years ago, with the exception that most clients use dynamic fees now. We should address it with bigger blocks, more intelligent bidding, more promotion of modern clients, more efficient transaction schemes like trustless bundling, payment channels, federated trust multisig arrangements like BitGo, etc

1. Buy Bitcoin
2. Wealth is now on the Internet
Not a complicated process. The remittances or capital flight to other currency stories don't tell the whole story because both sides must balance somehow. It just makes capital flight a little bit more accessible, if you don't know how to do it yourself, you can let someone else do that arbitrage.
The PRC doesn't police everyone as hard as the US or western countries do, they make tough general policy and tough bank policy, but at the individual level they aren't going after people for sending money abroad using Bitcoin, even with the KYC of the exchanges.
And there is a lot of corruption, so there are people who can get capital over borders by paying people off, or just by following loopholes: for example Chinese people can buy things overseas like houses and expensive University educations, they just can't send fiat.

Can you explain why a single person controlling a lot of currency would break things? I don't understand how this can be realistic: in the real world money is very far from being evenly distributed. 
The proof of stake system also is still in question for Ethereum, it seems credible that no switch to PoS will occur
In a similar situation with Bitcoin I could imagine a problem with p2sh. Bitcoin is not really advertised in the same way as a contract system, so there isn't the same expectations, but even so if there were a bug with p2sh that allowed some guy to steal funds sent to 3xx addresses would I favor a roll back? Very very broadly that would be a similar situation. I would in that case favor a roll back: the primary mission of Bitcoin is not the world computer it is predictable and decentralized money. If there were no other option I would say an exception must be made
I think there are no good options for Ethereum now, only maybe bad and more bad. A hard fork to claw back losses is scary: it's a literal bailout of a failed company. A soft fork to prevent movement is also scary but less so: it's a policing action that says some funds are not legal because of how someone obtained them. No action says: Ethereum has no stated mission and is neutral to use, if you are stolen from we will not protect you because we have no goals or position in what is right and wrong

It's written in code that lives on your computer. They can't change that code on your computer, so they can't change that number. 
There is actually no "the Blockchain" really, there are many Blockchains that each person keeps a copy of. They happen to match each other, but they don't have to, someone can mess theirs up and then they just become incompatible with you. So that is what would happen if someone changed their own code to say 50 billion bitcoin. They would no longer be compatible with you, they'd be using some other thing.
This is called the *consensus rules*. A change to those rules is called a *hard fork*. Your software will keep doing what it is doing with no need for developers and they can't change your software either

Bundling transactions actually gives you a cheaper rate per transaction, not a more expensive rate. Only 10% of transactions are multi-sig. So Voorhees is just misleading people, probably deliberately since I have already explained this to him and you can see the facts on the website.

Speaking as a coder, no I don't agree. Less eyes, less testing, a repository with only a few code submitters who don't seem to care about safety objections instead of 100 code submitters who are very careful about all safety objections, that is risk.


There is no fast way unless there is a very obvious problem where the cost of moving slowly outweigh the benefits of moving slowly. SegWit is merged now, if the miners wanted to, they could roll it out today. Moving carefully promises that we have a safe and reliable system for people's money.
The fastest fee is still about $0.10, not too high.
Miners are still not filling their blocks: average block size on 06/27 was 777k, on 06/26 it was 762k - why does the limit need to increase when the miners aren't even filling up their blocks?
Consensus is not about a few Core Devs or a few Miners, it is about all of the network. That takes time. That is a good thing, if it went too quickly, changed too easily, why would you trust your money there?
@_date: 2016-06-22 10:22:03
Estimating is very difficult because:
1. Blocks are coming in at random times between 0 minutes and 2 hours
2. Transactions are coming in randomly after your transaction with fees relative to existing transactions
If the send was initiated with Bitstamp, they have an instant option for instant withdrawals, maybe they deliberately set the fee lower to promote the instant withdrawal option that costs 0.1%
You could contact them to ask for the option to pay a priority fee

They didn't have the funds to cover their obligations. Not all fractional reserve banks offer interest enticements, some even charge fees.

How I understand the LN funds is that from the Blockchain perspective, they are sitting in a 2:2 multisig wallet, like GreenAddress. You said that they can only be used via the LN, but why can I not coordinate with the partner to spend the funds?
Can you tell me what exactly, specifically prevents spending the funds from the 2:2 multisig wallet as normal?


How does the Blockchain know that I can only spend it on LN? Same question as before, the funds are in this multisig wallet, why can't I spend them as normal?


What is the negative impact of the extreme difficulty and complexity? If there is no way to pay someone, it's possible to just pay using the Blockchain right? Or does something prevent that?


What about the other advertised benefits, like improved privacy, lower fee transactions and instantaneous confirmation? Do you think those are not important?


Do you mean that the wallets will not be able to hide the complexity as they do with Bitcoin? What complexity will not be hidden that will require effort from someone?


How do you know this, if it's made into a standard and promoted as such, maybe people wouldn't even realize that they are using it?




If a hacker got a virus installed on a machine running the LN, they could easily redirect all of your funds to another party.
I thought that this only applied to relays? Why exactly do I have to leave my software online if I am not a relay?


I thought that there is no reason a LN wallet has to be online any more than a normal Bitcoin wallet. What happens to me if I am not online?


Because money is relative to people's situation: some people might consider risking $1 and $10 to be the same, and the same goes for $100 vs $1000


Is this saying that because high value transactions already work over the Blockchain well, that no improvement is possible? Aren't people saying that high value transactions work progressively less well, if the bar for what is a micropayment rises?


Yeah exactly that's what I said


You can just split it up right? The network doesn't know the difference between you putting in $100,000 or 100 people putting in $1000? You don't think we could find people who have 161 bitcoins on their computer or you just think they are foolish?




OK so when you say people, you are meaning the maximum number of people that could possibly use it, without bundling? My point is that even if you increase capacity, it's possible that you are really only increasing it for a small number of individuals who make an outsize number of transactions, instead of transaction demand being evenly spread, because the people are opaque to the network and we can only see transactions that could even all be from one person

Contentious hard forks are best avoided for these reasons but you can't stop people from doing them so best to be prepared. Only ever receive bitcoins with a Bitcoin Core full node. If you hear of a hard fork happening, do not do any transactions at all for a while, then seek guidance for how to start making transactions again.
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:05:20
Yes if you want to take back the spend, you have to double spend. A transaction is like a signed check that has no time-out, and not only a miner can hold on to it, anyone can hold on to it and re-broadcast it

Core just had a meeting to figure out how to bring this release together, the notes are published somewhere: they are very long so I just skimmed them, but it seems like it won't be too long. One interesting thing seems to be that no one will implement SegWit in the Core wallet in this release, it will only relay. This is because SegWit needs to be given time to take hold in the network and be protected by consensus before it is used

How can the assumption that Bitcoin transactions must occur on the Blockchain be justified? Fiat and gold suffer from no similar hindrance. Most Bitcoin already is likely exchanged in non-Blockchain transactions. How is this technical detail relevant to the greater picture?

I'm wondering if the change to priority space policies caused the jump around October, extremely low fee transactions like under $0.01 used to get confirmed more quickly because of those policies
Of course those policies implemented by the miners are in part a reaction to the market, but I think they also represented an untenable situation in which priority space was abused by spammers, at least that's what I heard was happening
Thanks for your charts, I do think they represent that unless there is a fee event the fees are not moving upward so quickly that we need a quick one month hard fork, there's not even much of a strong upward trendline yet

Smart contracts aren't to blame, dumb people are. They didn't worry about how or why, they just did stuff because they could get it looking like it was working and just ignored the foundational design errors. Most altcoins and even very very early Bitcoin had this issue. You can't rush this stuff, engineering takes time and a proper mission
The reason Bitcoin doesn't have smarter or more accessible contracts is because they aren't scalable and it's a bad pattern for people to make super complicated contracts without huge amounts of testing; and dumbing down the language actually always just hides details that are necessary to see for full understanding of how the code will react and they aren't even all that useful over standardized but flexible contract templates.
The reaction of Ethereum is bad because they have no good option. Censorship is bad so soft forks are out. Stealing is bad which is bad for both soft fork and hard forks. Leaving it is bad because it shows the flaw in the platform that has no easy fix

I've been auto downvoted more than a thousand times. Those same bots auto upvoted you.
The policy to moderate more aggressively is in clear and direct response to an attack that went beyond what could be handled through the previous hands-off attitude
You yourself admit the alternative is to be flooded with conspiracy theories and endless vicious attacks on the developers who are hard at work to keep Bitcoin running, as they have been for many years
If you want to fix things, don't add to the cycle of conspiracy and criticism, try being productive and contribute. 99 times out of 100 you come here yourself to bash Core, to bash Theymos. Or someone is linking to something where you do said same. Or some content that is said same. 
What is being lost? Idiotic conspiracy theories or worse, the frequent threats of violence against core developers in Roger Ver's nightmare house of horrors? Good riddance

We were talking about a change to Bitcoin Core, if it were a change to an SPV client I would say Mike Hearn is an expert in SPV
The most expert minds of Bitcoin Core agree that a soft fork feature rollout is a better idea than a hard fork. That's also how it's always been done, so we have a lot of experience with doing things that way

It doesn't have to be a slider, it can be a toggle switch: high priority. Even things like email have had this concept, people can understand the meaning of flagging high priority without understanding the Bitcoin protocol

@_date: 2016-06-28 05:52:05
So far it seems like the agreement looks like it may be broken already.
F2Pool signed they would run Core, but their software signaled for Classic, which Core's software does not do.
AntPool signed they would go ahead with the SegWit plan, but then they said they might not do that, even though they said they would.
This is a good proof that the only contracts that count are smart contracts on the Bitcoin Blockchain, everything else is just words

I think a lot depends on the guy who drained the money taking this to a court. I'd like his case if he did it, the guys who run Ethereum and the DAO can't have their cake and eat it too: they can't have the legal protection of being hands off and then be able to go hands on when something goes wrong. 
They stated a deal, the deal went south, now they are trying to act like the deal was wrong. But you don't get to back out of deals because "oh now it looks bad for me, what I really meant was something else".

Please find someone posting about a stuck transaction that did not fall into one of these categories


Every day, using both low and high fees. How often do your own transactions get stuck?


There is no solution, just like there's no solution that there are more people wanting 1000 bitcoins than there are 1000 bitcoins to go around.
Proper fee calculation minimizes the risk of a transaction taking a long time or getting stuck


A number of transaction complaints I see are from people who paid zero fees.

Why is Bitcoin superior to PayPal and WU? It's still cheaper, and it has many other benefits. Merchants generally keep the savings themselves though. Bitcoin does have no standard service to judge chargebacks except bitrated which is not widely used, it's possible but not present

SegWit is a bug fix for Bitcoin bugs. Proceeding carefully is a good idea though, SegWit has been running since December in testing and it was published like a year before that.
The Bitcoin Core devs demonstrate a pretty good commitment to conservative coding, for example they changed all the signature code with libsecp256k1 but they rolled that out in a cautious way
Really nothing bad would have happened to Ethereum if they had allowed the DAO to collapse instead of using a bailout. There would have been free competition in the market to create a better DAO.

If the U.S. really wanted to, if there were great margins in it, they could go to Intel and do a project with them that would blow China out of the water. But Bitcoin is still a small potatoes project in the grand scheme of things, it still needs to prove itself. Also Intel dominating mining wouldn't really be any better than China dominating.

The transaction used a low fee, so your transaction has to wait in line behind higher fee transactions to be processed
Your transaction used a fee of around 10 - you can see the waiting information here:

Mining doesn't necessarily get harder, it can get easier too. It is designed to match the energy cost, so if people drop out due to electricity costs the difficulty will get easier and the electricity costs will go down.
After the mining reward goes away, there should still be transaction fees. The current level of fees alone is a larger reward than all the block rewards until 2013
It will take a long time for the rewards to wind down

Doesn't that support my point? That if nodes go up in cost, that people will no longer be able to afford to use a Bitcoin Full Node?


Can you explain how scaling is an economic argument? To me, scaling is: "the math works" or "the math does not work". Whether the software can actually perform is a big question, a mathematical question, not an economics question


I am advocating that the interests of the network are aligned with people's own self interest, and that people should follow their self interest. But I am very much arguing that people should not be misled about the facts, or pushed or coerced into making a decision, they should decide it freely. So if you are happy that I and many others will choose to remain on the Bitcoin Core roadmap, I am happy that you disagree and wish to use some other software. Maybe we can just agree to disagree? It certainly feels like you want me to change my software, or for others to change their software. 


The demand is not only from transaction creators, it's also from full node users, and people who want certain aspects of the system to remain, like decentralization. If you increase the supply of one, you incur a cost on others. There is no way to increase the capacity without incurring a cost, or do you disagree?

One confirmation has a problem where it's very possible to happen even by pure accident: two miners just happen to find a block at exactly the same time.
It's random, but it happens around once per day on a broad average.
Now that we have a recent situation where mempools are diverging a lot, I think one block double spends could become more common, even just through accidents
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:06:12
The tools to pick fees are lagging behind. Users can't easily indicate the relative priority of their transactions. We don't have good RBF tools to make adjustments in-flight
This will change as fees become more of a reality. The next version of Electrum for example should include RBF UI and more discrete economic indicators attached to transactions to allow users to specify economic/normal/priority on their transactions. These features are coming to Bitcoin Core too

That is not what they are proposing for the censorship part
Miners can't easily pull back a soft fork to take the enticing reward if a significant portion of the network has updated to the soft fork as well, that is a hard fork that splits the network

Yes, miners can make invalid blocks at any time. The best network defense against this is to only accept incoming payments with the latest version of Bitcoin Core and not depend on miners to always mine valid blocks. With a full node, invalid blocks will simply be ignored.

Adjusting consensus rules seems to be slow, and rate of value change seems to be fast. If volatility weren't a factor it might work better yeah. I could see people getting mad that the bypass fee that used to be $1 was now $5
If the bypass fee were too high in BTC it could become a ridiculously high value that would really be pretty useless because you could just pay a high fee that would be lower. Like you could literally program in 0.001 as your fee today and pretend like it was a bypass and it would work the same
Too low is not as big a problem but it could become meaningless and an attack vector. 0.001 sounds like a well thought out number though: I wouldn't see that as solving anything conclusively but a solution with a 0.001 bypass could be an optimization as part of a larger solution, I've had the same thought as you before

You'd think the people most worried about technical debt might be the people actually contributing code to the codebase. Mike Hearn is not one of those people. In fact he seems happy to keep copying the code of the people whom he thinks can't design things properly.
Technical debt is one of those assessments that are subjective.
As for security, it depends on the soft fork, not all soft forks are alike. In the "secure" case the design works like this: if you have not updated to the soft forked version, you will not see the incoming transactions. What you can't see, you won't trust. So people still should change to the new version just like in a hard fork, it just doesn't force them to to continue to be a part of the network.
As an example, let's say you do want to use multisig. Well if the other guy doesn't give you a 3* address, you can't just force that on him. 
I think Hearn is right to say that soft forks must be carefully considered and analyzed, it's not automatically "good" if it's a soft fork. Hearn is wrong to say that Sigwit if he says it is bad because it's a soft fork, because he can't name any negative effects other than technical debt, which is subjective and he is not a credible assessor and of course potentially has an agenda to promote hard forking since he is championing another hard fork.

Miners have in the past made invalid blocks for a variety of reasons. You have cause and effect mixed up: miners changing the rules is a possible effect of the cause of users changing the rules but it's not the only possible cause

Bitcoin transactions include the fees, only miners can take them and only by taking them in a block


The miners get a combined reward of block subsidy free printed money and fees. Right now the fees are higher than the block subsidy value was for years in the early days of Bitcoin, and that was enough security at that point.
Jumping in to compete for the fees is called mining. Only miners can claim fees

It's possible that the Chinese exchanges are also buying Bitcoin with fake fiat, but none have reported withdrawal issues, so that seems unlikely

To initiate a hard fork a developer simply changes the consensus software code on his computer or gives it out to other people.
Now his code thinks that there are 50 billion coins and the other people's code still thinks that there are 21 million coins. It is not very complicated to change consensus software, really any developer could do it.
There is no voting, it's just other people who happen to run the same compatible consensus software as you will be able to interact with you, and people who don't run that won't be compatible. If you run 50 billion coin code and I run 21 million coin code, our software won't work together and we won't be able to communicate with or impact each other.

Your constant FUD about Core not caring enough about scaling for example
1. Core has tons of scaling work under their belt, more now than ever before. Just visit their website where they have clearly laid out timing and details, or look at past releases
2. This scalability FUD is timed to go along with the Gavin Andresen narrative of "fire all the developers if they can't make it scale"
I wouldn't have any big issue with you if you didn't attack other people. Yeah I might not like your businesses but you have a perfect right to start them and the outright scamminess of them is close to but still on the right side of fraud. But when you start to throw stones as supposed sinners, it invites a look at your own sins. If you care about scaling so much, put up or shut up: sponsor a developer to work on a scaling project.

Maybe your opinion might be turned into actual facts if someone would sponsor the requisite research. With all due respect, no one really gives a fig about your opinion.
Sponsoring other projects would still help increase the block size, given that the stated reason against increasing the block size is all of these blocking issues that need fixing. Contribute to solving the blocking issues and you are contributing to a block size increase.


When an attacker seizes 51% of mining equipment to DoS the network, I suppose you would be happier if the network just went down. Having no ready option to resist attacks makes them more likely, and that makes Bitcoin less useful.

I think this needs to be considered from an adverse conditions standpoint, not an optimization standpoint. How does it hold up when not everyone is cooperating? I think the jury is still out on that one and that the technical answer doesn't look good


For me the worst test of a hard fork would be for something controversial. Wishing something isn't controversial doesn't make it not controversial. 
And if we prove that it's easy to marginalize and shut out significant dissent, what does that mean for you the next time you end up on the dissenting side?


Block size increases can be done in a soft fork as well as a hard fork, SegWit is the proof of that. We may never need to deliberately create a hard fork, so it's not that obvious we should conduct that fire drill


Wouldn't SegWit deliver the cheaper transactions that are sought? What is that plan lacking?


People attack me all the time, but my meaning is that in a hard fork it is a situation where my node is kicked off the network. In a soft fork even if I don't agree I can participate. So I want to keep my existing rules, and the people seem to be angry at me that I want to keep my existing rules, whereas since I advocate a soft fork, everyone else can keep their existing rules too and we can remain compatible with each other

What is a block constitution?
If these transactions are not double spending, that means they had to suffer a wait because no one knows when they will mine a block. That limits the impact of selling block space individually
The fee system is an estimate, for example Ant-Pool mines empty blocks all the time, they simply ignore all the fees.

A limit that the miners control has no real purpose. The limit is on them, if they decide it, then it's the same as having no limit.


Incentivizing miners isn't the issue, the security of Bitcoin is directly related to the amount of reward. If the reward goes down, security goes down. 1 BTC every 10 minutes gives less reward than Litecoin, which would make Bitcoin less secure than Litecoin

Users have to actively stop using the Bitcoin Blockchain rules set by Satoshi Nakamoto that have remained unchanged for eight years and use a client made by people who have declared Bitcoin a failure or are literal racist Nazis, and they have to do it within ten minutes or they will be on a separate network and you put that in the fine print and call that passive.

Time will tell, but I've heard from multiple sources that the marginal cost of a top-end competitive miner is not a dominant factor, leading me to believe that the half point will not bring a corresponding halving in the reduction of the hashing power

That's just your opinion, everyone has one I guess, but you won't be very convincing if you can't explain your reasoning.
I don't see why it matters how something is implemented, only what the outcomes are. Only allowing one way of implementing something for no stated reason seems dogmatic: an open minded approach would only consider the costs and the end benefits and not how they are brought about.

Given that no one can predict the price:
People view risk as a cost. You buy a lottery ticket for a million bucks but you only pay a dollar because of the risk of not winning. Another way of thinking about risk is lack of information: you don't know if the lottery ticket will win or not. After the lottery numbers are known, the ticket changes value, because the risk changes. There is more potential for reward before the lottery, because the ticket could potentially give you a million bucks. But: there is also clearly a lot of potential for loss, most tickets don't win. After the numbers are known, the potential for reward is basically nothing.
Some things about the halving are unknown right now: particularly how people will react to it. We know a lot of other things about it though, so the price is unlikely to be very dramatically changing. If you act now, you have a better chance for reward, but you also have a higher potential for loss, that is just the nature of risk and reward. It's up to you to figure out the ratio, no one really knows what they are because they mostly depend on random human psychology and chance.

Quite unpredictable, it really depends on what the server operator does, which is opaque. Generally speaking it should be uncommon based on empirical observation, but logically speaking nothing prevents it from happening.
If you know the CoPay server operator, or you run one yourself, you might be able to make a more informed choice.
You could always just run received payments through a Bitcoin Core node, then re-send them on to yourself on your CoPay wallet, that is what I do.

Up, Blockchain is not a very efficient design, it was costly for years already and we haven't changed too much about it to change that

There are normal transactions that we could do without lightning that would lower fees. For example if we had a buddy system where we grouped our transactions together, we'd save on fees. There are lots of solutions.

People think that miners sell as they mine to pay off their electricity and other bills, creating downward market pressure, pressure which will be cut in half at the halvening.
This is a market though so any future event that may be anticipated, should theoretically be built into the price as far as it can be anticipated.
The main benefit of the halvening should be to remove uncertainty surrounding the halvening. Some people have even suggested that miners will stop their hashing, leading to lengthy delays (mostly people with agendas to push though)

That's why we have smart contracts, and not regular contracts. If we wanted regular contracts where the intent matters, then you need a court and a government to decide that. And same thing with money, if we wanted regular money where you can freeze criminals assets and take them back, because they committed a crime, well we got that too it's called courts and government. This is the worst of both worlds, the bullying of the unrestricted majority combined with the unpredictability of human subjective feeling. This isn't backed by math, it's backed by tribalism, by tyranny of the majority. There's no real line where shitty contract begins and exploit ends, not any line a computer would understand because it's not math it's a subjective judgement call.

From a fee perspective isn't it a good thing that large transactions would be paying more fees? Since fees are flat the impact should be relatively lower. I'd mind paying a $0.05 fee on a $0.50 transaction a lot more than on a $5000 transaction

I don't really think you can ever design a crypto that can prevent someone from getting a huge position. Karpeles at one point may have controlled 800,000 bitcoins. Brian Armstrong today claims to control more than 1,000,000 bitcoins. They didn't get there by being Satoshi or stealing (well debatable with Karpeles), just through the normal market forces
Of course my bias is that I don't understand how PoS can possibly work and the proposals I have seen and heard about all seem to have contradictions and fatal flaws that would seem to make them unworkable, even if they were well distributed which seems impossible given logic and history

Bitcoin is a currency designed to be universally usable, require no trust and not be reliant on any single party for its operation.
Having a universal standard empowers progress, not requiring counter-party risk empowers individual liberty.

No conspiracy, just look at the referenced numbers
Assuming the average trade on Paxful is pretty small, like $20, that is around 6,300 transactions per day, and we can see here:  that the number of transactions per day total are around 225,000 - meaning Paxful by their own numbers are probably less than 3% of transaction traffic per day, not a very large chunk at all

So then my point stands, that there was never any there there?
This is not *dirt*. Karpeles screwing people over is not a juicy piece of gossip. It's not a page six item. What I'm talking about is publicly available, well known evidence. The fact that you object so strenuously to this is pretty telling, but I understand that you suffered some health problems and I won't take your reaction personally.


Here is what I would say. The malfeasance is not the disease, it is the symptom. The disease is what led to these people being chosen. Why did they start the Foundation? How did the process fail so spectacularly that an extremely obvious scam organization was put on the Foundation website in the first place? The answer is a lack of foundational mission, a problem which has never ever been solved, with each generation of Foundation leadership simply passing the buck of responsibility back to the last and repeating the same errors.
I've invited you, in your previous role, quite specifically to remedy that. I'd love nothing more if you had been able to remediate the systemic underlying issues that made the Foundation problematic. Even though I made simple, easy recommendations, that even a volunteer could easily accomplish, I was totally ignored. And many others were ignored out of hand, with your characteristic antagonizing defensive reaction about being an unpaid volunteer. The only notable actions you took in your capacity, although unofficially, was to organize an extravagant party in tropical climes to, as you put it, engage in a private gathering of friends. Well that is not remediation. That is more of the same. That's what I've seen time and again, more of the same. I wish I had some positive facts to report, I really do, but my efforts there have been quite fruitless.
I'm not trying to be negative. I'm trying to point out that there is an abusive organization that clearly showed repeated breaches of trust, more of which I find every time I research the matter, and shows to me absolutely zero sign of change. Since you stepped down from your managing position, I'm probably no longer talking to the person who might be able to fix things, but my statements are based on facts and quoted, cited evidence. I merely invite people to make their own decisions and form their own opinion based on the available record and history.

You can even still use a bank if you want, banks could act as trusted signatories but non custodial escrow to dispense coin to your phone wallet.

In the future it's possible there will be no more fiat currency so selling Bitcoin will no longer be an option. Instead you will simply use them to buy products or services that you desire or need.

Litecoin is slower than Bitcoin
You might misunderstand how mining and confirming works, I have written about the process here: 
To confirm transactions more quickly, the cost to reverse them must also go up more quickly. Litecoin takes longer to confirm because its cost to reverse a transaction does not go up as quickly. The blocks are only mile markers in that process, more mile markers doesn't mean you are going farther. It's recommended that you wait for 3-6 Bitcoin blocks, and maybe more depending on your specific exchange.

There are three types of wallets, light wallets, full nodes, and custodial wallets
- A full node downloads the entire Blockchain, all the history of transactions
- A light client downloads only a subset of the Blockchain, mostly stuff related to your own transactions
- A custodial wallet doesn't give you the Blockchain at all and makes transactions on your behalf
1. The light client leaks privacy by revealing to a third party which addresses a specific IP is interested in, and which addresses are linked to which other addresses, and which wallet an address is related to, etc.
1. The custodial wallet leaks privacy by revealing to the custodial third party everything about the wallet, it is actually their wallet
1. The full node downloads everything, requesting no specific information: only the same as every other full node, so nothing is revealed about which parts of the Blockchain it is interested in
Tor is a useful companion to full nodes so that your IP is not even related to your actions with your wallet. Bitcoin Core supports Tor out of the box, it will automatically use it if it is present and even form multiple new Tor channels to avoid any metadata linking or exit node shenanigans.

Don't share your xpub address widely, even though it is called a "pub" address, if combined with a single one of your private keys it can be used to steal all your funds.
You should never have been re-using your address, that is not in line with the reference Bitcoin implementation and it hurts the entire network's privacy and your security so it's strongly discouraged.
All modern wallets are moving to a new model of address generation that is called HD or hierarchical deterministic. This makes new addresses for you based on a master seed that can be used to easily back up all your funds

I don't really agree with this. The cost is a value, it's not a BTC value, it's an abstract value meaning it takes more work, more real expense to accomplish


My thought on this is that correlation does not prove causation. There are many factors at play, I would object to picking one variable, "average block size", and saying that there is a direct and causal relationship to "node count". There are many variables that have influenced this equation, like the release of a vastly cheaper node type: Bitcoin version 0.12.0 and vastly increased publicity around the issue of full nodes.
My argument is that the average block size represents a causal relationship to the cost on a node operator going up, which is clearly the case since each transaction must have some non-zero marginal cost. It's a broader argument of cause and effect, not a specific correlation to what we have seen in the local period of recent history.


Here is my simple explanation of why the math does not work. In computer science there is a basic mathematical language to describe the cost of algorithms. O(log n) would be a very fast algorithm, with even a high n value yielding a low total cost. An example of this math in the real world is looking up a word in a dictionary. You can narrow in on the word you want by over shooting and under shooting until you get to the place you want. 
[Everyone agrees]( that the computer science way to describe the Blockchain on-chain scaling is O(n^2). This means that a high n value will not just have a high cost, it will have an exponentially high cost. This is because every full node that joins the Blockchain network incurs a cost on every other full node already in the network: they all have to validate and sync and store all the transactions of every new guy. Imagine a chat room in which everyone has to read the messages of the other people in order to respond. In the beginning it would be OK, but after a while that chat room would be so noisy it would take a huge effort to keep up.
I will grant you that scaling on-chain would be great, how simple and easy and nice our system is now is amazing. But because of this potentially huge cost that could potentially grow so large that it wouldn't be mathematically possible to keep up with, we need to make sure that looking ahead we aren't hitting these problems. And these issues are not all that far off. In July of last year, many block explorers were knocked offline because they couldn't process the large transactions that F2Pool created to clean up a dust spam attack on the network. Gavin Andresen had to put in 2 special other limits in his 2mb patch, just to prevent even more potential denial of service attacks that could knock nodes offline or keep them CPU grinding for minutes or hours. Miners themselves are reluctant to increase the size of the blocks they make, due to their desire for caution: remember they already have a super fast relay network that already is faster than compact blocks would be, and even given that they themselves have stated that they don't want to increase beyond a few megabytes for fear of network disruption.


I will definitely grant you that people are not perfectly rational. At a zoomed out level though, more or less we have to make assumption that people will be rational in the large even though they aren't necessarily in the small. If that weren't true, miners would attack the system and it would not work at all. Because miners have to pay a cost to attack the system, it does work, for the most part.


Remember that I want a small blocksize increase as well, just in a different method of deployment


As a node operator, I can act as a free rider if I give up running my node. There's no real difference to me if I let other people take over the job. So if the cost starts to become too high for me to run my node, I will be more likely to take advantage of the free rider position and let others take that over. But if everyone thinks that way, then we have a big problem because everyone is pointing at the other guy and saying he should pay.


The security that nodes provide is not really related to hacking. If you have a full node, even a fully hacked node can't do anything bad to you. Even a SPV client that checks the PoW is protected from a large degree from hacking. This is not a hacking nodes question. If there is a hacking danger, it is a danger of the miners being hacked, or being malicious. If a large percentage of the miners start to break the rules in a way that goes against users' interests, the only defense against that is a full node validating them. What are the rules that are important to protect? Preventing theft, preventing printing more than 21 million coins, preventing printing coins too fast, all of those things you want to be as difficult as possible for a miner to accomplish. And the way you do that is by having a very diverse network of economically important validators that would put as large as possible a cost on the miners who did that "dishonest" action. If we move more and more to not-validating, we are reducing our security against dishonest miners more and more as well.
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:17:33
Currently there are a lot of transactions waiting to confirm
You can view them here : 
You are in the 20-30 category, they predict a wait time of up to 10 hours. Personally I would guess you will have to wait another 3 hours. There's no way to really be sure because new transactions come in all the time


It probably will confirm, but if it doesn't you can contact BitPay - if it doesn't confirm then funds did not move successfully


Yeah it's a bummer. There's features to allow fixing a fee that is too low, but they aren't really available yet and they should be.
But you should also always expect up to 3 hours for a confirmation due to normal variance in the block timing

If you are talking about what bitcoin.org says, it means that the CoPay wallet does not really check whatever the CoPay server says.
You could think about a Bitcoin client doing 3 types of validation:
1. Trust whatever the server says
2. Trust whatever the server says, if it agrees with whatever 51% of the miners say
3. Trust nothing anyone says, validate everything
CoPay is in category 1: it trust the CoPay servers. If you are receiving payments, it is strongly recommended that the payments be relayed through a Bitcoin Full Node that fully validates, because if someone hacks the server or they are malicious or something, they could feed your CoPay client some bad data and something could look "confirmed" but it wasn't really confirmed from the perspective of the full nodes in the network

SegWit is faster and safer. Instead of requiring everyone to switch at once which takes a long time to get agreement, people can switch as fast as they want.
The code is not a DAO, just because code A has bugs doesn't mean code B has bugs. A hard fork is code too, it could have bugs.
Also if you are worried about bugs just don't use SegWit and your funds are the same as they were before

There is no government, this is an anarchistic grouping. The limits involved are not completely arbitrary, only partially arbitrary. A speed limit on a road is arbitrary, couldn't it be 1 higher or 1 lower? Why does the government decide? Because decisions have to be made and you can't analyze everything to death. I appreciate some sensible limits as a matter of practical necessity


Almost everything I buy is a competition with other people who also want it, and I pay more. It doesn't bother me because this is how the universe works, it's just physics


You should stop using electricity, you are making global warming worse


Fees that better indicate relative priority to the user so that miners can make more intelligent decisions. Let someone who wants a faster fee make it faster. Let people who don't care as much drop out. This will yield a more optimal result.

The transaction could disappear but that would just mean the funds never moved. Funds only move on the blockchain - if it's someone sending you funds then they need to send again, if it's you, then you need to send again

The motivation is not more on-chain transactions, but rather presenting a false case to investors that on-chain transactions have no scalability limits. The road it leads down is one in which users cannot be free from trusting middlemen third parties to verify transactions, or to safeguard their privacy.

If these guys would just support payment channels (not even Lightning), you wouldn't even need to trust them with your coins. You would just lock some funds with them (only actually locked if they refuse to cooperate) and then you could do one transaction every week or however you were comfortable with having the lock time for. Mike Hearn even wrote a convenient library to do this. It's the same dumb reason that Coinbase won't prove their reserves: making you trust them is cheaper and easier and customers have to demand a no trust cryptographic solution or they won't get it

I'm saying that it isn't really quantifiable what the capacity is, because it's a layered and multifaceted number. What is the transaction capacity of gold? It's just a cost depending on various ways it is used and transactions are formed. Moving gold between people is expensive, but cheaper if made into coins, and cheaper still if done on virtualized ledgers. There's no single way to describe transaction capacity, or put a limit on capacity if Bitcoin is used as unit of account, as far as I can figure.

If proof of stake could be made to work, it would be better since it's more efficient and faster.
Proof of work's energy creation and use generally carries a negative connotation due to its common correlation with abuses of the environment. Although Bitcoin's design merely favors the least expensive source of energy possible, many power creation methods create unwanted externalities of cost, making energy itself a loaded word.
In a proof of work design, miners are not trusted, only their work, as verified by cryptographic math. Given that the work takes time, this introduces a cost to using the system: waiting for sufficient work. Proof of stake argues that trusting individuals based on their stake vastly increases the speed of proof: miners merely signal their view, their identity serving as their proof, without any significant time restriction.
Proof of work designs generally use a rewards based system based on time decreasing rewards, as a bootstrapping method to quickly create enough security for transacting. But this limited variable may also serve to mask a lurking challenge, what happens after the rewards disappear? Merely the presence of this quandary presents a challenge to the confidence in Bitcoin: fees amount to a variable seen to easily change or never be sufficient, with potentially destructive consequences. In a proof-of-stake system, the purpose of a block reward is muted, removing a variable to consider when thinking about the long term future of the system.
An additional proof of work issue in the long term is the anticipation of a phase in which renting proof of work becomes possible. An attacker who might rent enough hash power to double spend their transactions might be able to shield themselves from the future repercussions a standard miner with their own hash power equipment would suffer. If proof of stake could be made to work, attackers might find acquiring a majority stake made them prohibitively exposed to future downturns in the currency value, dis-incentivizing them from exhibiting behavior detrimental to the currency value.

I agree that capacity increase could be urgently needed at some point, and even that any increase in cost of transactions harms adoption, to some degree.

I think you hit on the reason why altcoins won't just win though, they aren't a silver bullet. There are many variables at work, many more than fees.
I think it's ok to be frustrated with the pace of crypto. But if we fight all the time and shout, it will slow things down, not make them faster. It will divert work from solutions to arguments and attacks. That is where I see the slowdown happening, people taking the easy way out instead of just going heads down and making solutions

It's partially about that, but it is also about actually losing those rewards, or losing the opportunity cost to get more rewards
This is not a desirable situation where miners are given "trust", meaning that we have to consider their costs and benefits.

Miners just include transactions, verification is done by the entire network


The reward is designed to incentivize provable spending of money on electricity/equipment, not verification. The reward is its own purpose


Bitcoin could fade in popularity so it could become less valuable over time (heaven forfend)


The target time for blocks is set at ten minutes, no matter how many miners there are


The difficulty of mining is designed to track the reward, so the design implies that miners only break even at any price, there is no "replacing profits", the design is that mining should be only barely profitable as it is a commodity business that anyone should be able to enter


If transactions become less attractive then fees go down in value, given a fixed supply




Miners don't get any more efficient at making blocks faster, there is a fixed rate at which blocks arrive: every ten minutes


The rise in Bitcoin value is tempered by the fact that people will front run the expected rise, preventing the rise. If I tell you that a lottery ticket will be worth 1 million dollars and you believe me, you won't pay me $1 for it, you will pay me something close to 1 million dollars for it


Pretty soon the blocksize will increase, consensus willing. It can't go up infinitely though, not without breaking things on the way

It may be a no-brainer to you, but I require more convincing. I want to weigh the costs and benefits. How much more can we do with what we have? It doesn't look like we can do a lot more. The miners say they wont' even mine more than 3x or 4x more, even if given the choice. I want to think about how we get a 100x or 1000x better solution, not a 3x or 4x better.


I don't want you to portray me as saying Bitcoin will always succeed no matter what. Just to put that straw man to rest: I am in favor of hard forks, if they are warranted. Hard forks are always going to happen anyway, that is the nature of a decentralized system, hard forks are just a matter of perspective since no one owns the definitive and authoritative rules of what the system is.


I see payment channels as the way forward. This is a solution that could create 1000x more capacity for Bitcoin commerce. I even see bigger blocks as a temporary small improvement that would be fine to have in the near term. I disagree about how to roll the bigger blocks out though.
Maybe I am wrong, but accept that I have a different opinion? Simply consider your thought for bigger blocks as the way forward to be your opinion, all I am asking for is for that opinion, your desired route, to not be pushed on me without my consent.

Gavin, Jeff, Mike, they are not experts in Bitcoin Core, they haven't kept up with the latest developments. Technology changes quickly, you have to stay current. For example they have not reviewed the SegWit code which is now in BitcoinCore master. They have not added any feature in years, 0 features, nothing
Meetings have topics they are not just about anything. Core has no current plans to develop a hard fork so it doesn't make sense to waste time discussing something they have no current plan for, which is what the meetings are for: current plans. You can see everything they talk about is current. Future plans go onto the mailing list

Soft forks aren't all that different from Hard Forks, the biggest difference is deployment strategy. Why wasn't p2sh rolled out as a hard fork? By now it would be like there was no difference, no one is running non-p2sh clients
Hard forks aren't bad, they're just a tool. What is very bad, very scary is using a soft fork or a hard fork to take people's money or stop their money from moving. I think  that if Ethereum decides against a hard fork to steal funds, which I think they will, it will help prove that people can be counted on to stand up for a neutral platform, although not conclusively.

Unfortunately views himself as a network decider, and he has decided that there is some nonsense about free speech involved with the version signaling mechanism.
This view is totally incorrect, the version signaling flag is a technical field designed to help the software coordinate consensus, not communicate arbitrary messages of support that software cannot understand. Unfortunately life is not perfect and we have to suffer the consequences of his mistake.

No 50% is exponentially decreasing. 50 -25 - 12.5 - 6 - 3 - can you see that the difference between those values is getting way smaller?
The half point doesn't half all of the supply, it only cuts the introduction of new supply in half.
Also we really don't know that Bitcoin will get more expensive all the time forever. It may have bad years. If we want to be a durable, useful system, we need to harden, to reduce vulnerability and chance. Not hope for miracles

Hashing is only a provable way to show that miners paid an expense, the algorithm does not matter at all. If you do not understand this, read the above link or this article I wrote on what Hashcash is: 


Bitcoin has a higher expense to mine and a greater reward per block, so you are getting more security because of that, not because of the hashes per second. Your security is that a miner would have to spend a lot of money to fake a double spend and then also lose out on a lot of money in rewards. 


This has nothing to do with speed of the network, latency and bandwidth are separate issues. If you want a priority transfer in Bitcoin, all you have to do is pay the fee price.
At some price, you can pretty much always get in if you're willing to outbid the other customers.

There is no *official* price, but the common price on many markets at the moment is around $760 for a Bitcoin.


Bitcoin units are actually just a convenient way to refer to 100,000,000 of the base unit: Satoshis. 1000 Satoshi units can be purchased for less than a penny.


The risks of the coins are that they might lose value, or you might lose access to them by mistake or theft
The benefits of the coins is that they may increase in value, and you might use them to store and spend wealth in new ways that are not possible in fiat

What I think are interesting improvements on wish-lists and in-progress:
1. Secure identity pinning and encryption for the p2p network to prevent observation and MITM
2. p2p network syncing blocks more efficiently by prevent transactions re-transmitting
3. Miners pre-announcing the transactions they intend to mine to allow faster sync and more accurate fee prediction
4. Transaction signatures covering transaction values to make syncing faster and simpler
5. Random spend transactions, allows charging less than a Satoshi by asking for a 50% chance Satoshi
6. Flexible block size controller that dynamically discourages too costly high block sizes
7. Longer SegWit addresses that improve security by preventing brute force attacks
8. MAST signatures for very large multi-signature smart contracts, like for widely distributed applications
9. Lower space using, faster, less malleable, larger multisig capable Schnorr signatures
10. Fraud proofs to sign off on the state of the chain for lightweight validation
11. Unspent transaction outputs set signing in the block headers to speed up sync and make SPV more secure
12. Pre-prepared forks to increase block sizes for when it is safe to do so
13. Pre-prepared forks to change Proof-of-Work to proactively prevent a miner attack on the network
14. Value pegging transaction logic that allows for provable one to one swaps of coins between chains
15. Hard fork version signaling to allow light clients to disable when consensus rules are changed
16. Confidential transactions to hide transaction amounts and transaction details
There are a lot of good ideas out there

Shouldn't be any difference, except that the sync and relay data may increase by up to 4x.
Updating to SegWit from non-SegWit may give an extra sync job: I think maybe with a pruned node you might want to update relatively quickly otherwise you will have to do a total re-sync to run through the larger blocks that you missed.
CSV won't make any change at all

Saying since Bitcoin is deflationary won't it go up is a tautology. Bitcoin could easily fall in price for any number of reasons, supply could increase or apparent supply could increase or demand could fall though, there is no telling. The price is just a function of supply and demand so if more demand exists and supply stays fixed naturally the price will go up

Pretty much the fast confirmation fee has been recommended at about $0.05 for years. Blocks always took the same amount of time, no change there, target is ten minutes but they can take up to a few hours even
It used you be that you could send free transactions or some coins could move faster than others, but that time is over now, the miners just go on a flat rate now

Still only one hash is found, the inputs to a block hash don't include all consensus rules
The inputs are:
- A piece of data to hash against called a nonce
- A pointer back to the previous block in the chain
- The current version
- A timestamp
- A counter
- A signature derived from all of the transactions in the block
- The consensus defined difficulty rating.
Just the block syncing protocol between peer to peer nodes, updated nodes ask for the updated style Block, legacy nodes continue to ask for the legacy block. Updated nodes can service both types of requests

For fees, it depends on your specific configuration: how often do you receive payments? Can you leave some coins on the Bitcoin Core for a while and send them together?
Typically I pay around $0.01 to send funds from Bitcoin Core to myself, it can be half that a lot of the time. It's quite affordable, in my configuration.
I'm not an expert on CoPay, but I know that it works on all of those platforms, and you can make a setup using multiple signing keys for funds.

I'm still sending transactions for half a penny - I don't see the urgency.
I buy the argument that fees may increase, I buy that, but I don't understand that it is urgent. It's been called "urgent" since Gavin said it was "urgent" over 12 months ago. But when I look at the simple numbers, I don't understand what is so urgent, if a transaction can still be sent for half a penny, what *urgent* use cases is that stopping?

I send transactions myself every day, and I have never paid anything more than about $0.10 for a normal transaction that confirms very quickly. 
Even during the height of the "backlog", I was using fees of about $0.02 and receiving confirmations within a reasonable time
Personally, I would not consider $0.02-$0.10 to be *brutal*
Of course, we could test it out today, the miners could lower the space for a couple weeks and see what would happen. I would like to see them attempt this, as a test so that we would have more information, and it could always be called off if there were a serious issue.

It's re-spending a transaction sent with 0 fee - so it will probably never confirm

The opposition to the roadmap has no active developers - just non-experts. You can find plenty of non-experts to support anything.
Active developers means people helping develop Bitcoin Core, which is an open source project anyone can help on. The maintainer of the project works at MIT. You can see the commits here, that will show you who is active:

Funds aren't sent from addresses at all. Wallets know their balances by keeping private keys and then following the chain of transactions to see how much funds are in unspent transaction outputs they control
This can be a complicated answer, not just a number. Like funds can be locked in multisig or timelocks, making them spendable only with a third party or after a certain time

It's the sync cost that grows. Each person who joins the network and starts sending transactions has to have their work synced to all the full nodes. So a person who joins doesn't just a 1 cost, they add 1 * $fullNodeCount cost


This puts pressure on the validation to grow more and more expensive.
It's a broadcast system where everyone broadcasts to everyone else. Imagine if email worked by everyone storing everyone else's emails. That would get expensive quickly!

It works by every transaction being a little under balanced. The miner can then take the unbalanced parts as its own in the coinbase transaction that pays out to the winning miner. As long as what goes in matches what goes out, plus the subsidy, it's all good

So all we have to weigh are your subjective opinions?
There is code out there can be reviewed and tested, are you saying that the only way to make statements about the outcome at all is to put it into production?
If you have these years of software experience, surely you can apply them to describe some potential specific fact based implications of the SegWit software that may be less than desirable?

It's a little unfair, but Gavin said just two weeks ago that Bitcoin was the Titanic: a ship going down. Since that time the price climbed from $450 to $600. Gavin also said that Craig Wright was Satoshi Nakamoto, I put together some research on why that is probably not correct: 
Maybe he is trying to teach people the hard way that you shouldn't trust anyone and verify everything

Everyone says the limit should be replaced. The only question is hard fork or soft fork
Both plans result in 2MB
The roadmap says bigger blocks: 2/4/8
The only question is doing it in a safe way, a way recommended by every single active developer or doing it in a dangerous way, that gains only a 50% off effect for fees as the benefit. 2mb won't solve stuck transactions, it won't make transactions free, it is just a small improvement

What happens if the marginal cost is like you say, insanely low, like let's say you can get a billion transactions for a penny. Let's say that there are a lot of people in the world who want to use the system, like 10 billion people want to use it every day. OK this is an insane case yeah but just pay attention to the total revenue here: ten cents. That doesn't sound like a lot to pay for hash power or security for the system. What happens if something like this happens: lots of popularity and advances in technology lowering the marginal cost but a low total fee revenue?
I think you're right about the next block being a potential premium point for fees
In any case I don't think this situation would be an issue for decades, but it's interesting to consider because I don't know what should happen

There is not a real solution for speeding up the process. Soon some wallets will come out that have methods to fix fees that were set too low, but they are not out yet.
Proactive for next time: It looks like your wallet is not adjusting your fee to the size of the transaction. So you need a new wallet that adjusts fees to match sizes

Contact Jaxx, that wallet is not open source 
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:51:27
It looks like your client is not adjusting the fee to the size of the transaction which is unusually large. You should get a new wallet that uses per kB fee payment
@_date: 2016-06-01 05:24:57
Gavin thought so too



It's not insane if you think fees will go to zero because of unlimited block space and no other solution will be possible. Bitcoin requires miners be compensated to some degree and so there is a potential free rider problem if fees don't work. Luckily, we are already seeing evidence that fees are providing some security, at a ratio that will soon double

There are peer to peer exchanges that aren't regulated, they just don't compete well in the market because they aren't as efficient. Check out  on freenode for an example of one


There's a way to do almost anything, but the tradeoffs might be undesirable. There's no way to put a $USD cap on the fees, because the network doesn't know anything about what USD means and no one has figured out a good way to make it know about that


There is a throttle built in yes, it is an auto adjusting process that happens every two weeks or so. If you want to read more, I have written about how mining works here: 


You can get reductionist with BTC, it's just a series of numbers flying through what I assume are the tubes of the Internet. Bitcoin is designed to work like gold though, not fiat.

They basically all are more active and only a minority receive salary from Blockstream. I would bet you can't name more than 10 contributors who are salaried Blockstream employees. Not that there is anything wrong with that, Blockstream is a totally fine company who employees many people who have been with Bitcoin from the beginnings.
Basically every contributor signed the roadmap yes. There are no active contributors who think that a rapid hard fork is a good idea.
If you want to go for it, you can, but don't ask everyone else to go along with it or pretend you are more expert on the code than all these people who actually work on the code.

You can think of it like there is a new big block and an old small block. The new format big block is still synced to everyone and still secured with proof of work: it is the real block going forward for the future of Bitcoin, but an old style smaller representation of the big block can still be created and sent to older nodes to maintain compatibility.
The major goal is that everyone updates to SegWit and that it becomes as much a part of Bitcoin as other soft forks like multisig/ps2h are, but that the process is a gentle one that maintains compatibility for as long as possible with older clients.

I'm not saying the price won't go up, I just don't want it to be a matter of life or death if it doesn't. If Bitcoin doesn't hit $10,000 per coin or more I'll be disappointed but I'll still want the network to keep working. I expect big challenges in the future of Bitcoin, some hard times in the long road ahead, I don't want a price drop to be a fatal blow.
I don't think paying a few cents fee is a big price to pay for that, and there are payment channels and other ideas to make even cheaper alternatives if those few pennies are too expensive for some. A few cents has been the price for years, started by Satoshi's suggestion and design, and we've managed to do pretty well with it so far.
If you want no-trust, peer to peer Bitcoin to work for everyone, full nodes have to also remain cheap enough to run, which means balancing the cost decreases of fees against the cost increases of nodes.

Miners have been quoted as saying that their marginal operational costs (electricity) are on the order of 20%
I'd say that this implies that the confirmation time period should remain basically unchanged when the halving occurs, to stay on the safe side I would expect a possible rise to 15 minute confirmation times during the adjustment period
Many miners are not always so attuned to their costs, miners have been known to have their blocks orphaned and forfeit their entire block reward because they forgot to update their version of Bitcoin Core.
I would expect at a macro-level that some miners would drop out due to the halving, if the price remains the same. 
The difficulty adjustment period for confirmation time targeting is 2016 blocks, or two weeks

Well the best indicator is fees. When fees get high, that is a great indicator that more and more low value transactions are being denied. So that informs the urgency for me. I'm still sending transactions with a fee of a few cents, so that does not indicate a very urgent situation to me.

Your transaction was confirmed. It took four hours, which is long, but you should always expect to wait at least three hours for a block due to normal variance, and some miners mine blocks that are empty.
If you want a priority transaction time, I suggest Bitcoin Core or any client that allows you to choose a higher fee for priority situations - or look at  for the fee layout

Hashing is like flipping coins.
Imagine a coin with two sides and a guy sits at a table flipping it and you sit down to watch him. Before you sat down, he flipped 10 heads in a row. Now that you sat down, what are the chances the next flip is another head? The chances are 50:50. Hashers are like coin flippers, they don't make any progress and there is no memory, there is only chance

I think it's overly simplistic, the elasticity of demand trips things up too much.
You also can't assume perfect information, I see a lot of services who are focused on making end user Bitcoin apps, they don't understand the dynamic fee part because they haven't reached that part of the learning curve or are too focused on making their App to research everything about Bitcoin

Core Devs don't control Bitcoin. You can see a proof right in front of you. If they can't unilaterally activate a soft fork which requires only a few miners to activate, then they can't unilaterally force a hard fork which requires tens of thousands of nodes to all switch

Fees are based on the size of the transaction data, not the value sent.
The data size depends on the complexity of the transaction: normally transactions are quite simple but if you do something like send 10 people a bitcoin each in a single transaction, it will cost almost 10x more in fees to do that. And it works the other way too, if you spend 10x received funds in a single transaction, it will also cost almost 10x more in fees.

He's right about the market rejecting SegWit even though the market he's talking about is just a few Chinese miners, centralized miners means the same old centralized slow and unpredictable decision making that we have with the current financial system. If you asked Fidelity what they wanted out of Bitcoin to support it they would ask for an end to anonymity and more centralization. Bitcoin hasn't failed because it hasn't given in to the demands of central power, in fact that's how it's proven its success.

Yeah for sure, I think of fees as priority indicators. High fees indicate that they are high importance, must be dealt with quickly. Low fees indicate low importance, can be discarded, or dealt with eventually. But most Bitcoin recipients in most cases might want to be alerted of all transactions all the time, priority is only important for people who have overflows and must perform triage.

The target hash discovery time is ten minutes, but this is a probabilistic statement. Since hashing has no memory and no progress, at any moment in time you will have to wait ten minutes for a confirmation, as the target
The "enough fee" part just means that you will hitch a ride in the block. Some blocks don't even have any transactions so it's not a hard and fast rule when it comes to fees, just generally speaking if you provide a high end fee you have a good chance to be in the next block

There's risks in everything. Those features are optional though, if you are worried you can avoid them.
It's widely said that Ethereum's language design is to blame for this. They made their language too easy, which hides critical details that can drastically change the meaning of their programs. They also made their language too powerful, it can do a wide variety of things. Very hard to figure out exactly what will happen + many things could happen = high chance for an exploit.

When you say "locked" it sounds like it is different from money in my own normal wallet. Can you describe how it is different? To me, it seems like it is not locked, because I can still spend it, just the same as if I were spending it from my own wallet.


Given that you are saying *might* be willing to tie up, it could be different from person to person. One person might lock $100, another might lock $10, another might lock $1,000. So when you say small, you are meaning smaller than the person's total holdings, not small as a specific number is that correct?
So I think you are saying that for people who have holdings that are significantly larger than their daily, monthly, or yearly spending, that they would be able to avoid Blockchain transactions using the Lightning Network, but others would not? 
Wouldn't it be difficult to make any definitive statement about the makeup of people's holdings versus their spending? This is a future situation, with unknown software, and we don't really have much data to go on about people's spending habits in Bitcoin, vis-a-vis their holdings. 


When you say that the person is subject to volatility risk, can you explain what that means exactly? What is the user risking?
Can you expand on your claim that hackers can game someone's system? What can they do, and what can they gain by doing it?


When you say "high value" and "low value" I find it confusing. The terminology suggests an objectively high value, like $10,000. But if I have a $100,000 channel, to me the $10,000 is still feasible within my channel. Is it fair to say that you always mean a "high value relative to the channel participants' total holdings"?


From the software perspective, there is no concept of a person. How can a person be scaled for, when they are not a variable in the equation? I mean, let's say that the system is improved to allow 10x more capacity. How does capacity for 1 person willing to spend 10x more on fees differ from a capacity for 10 people willing to spend the same for fees?


I would say that as an objectively "small" measure, that any transaction over $10 is not small. Just to quantify my assumptions, I view $1 as a "high" fee, and $9 and under as "small payments". If I go based on my own personal experience, almost all of my transactions fit well within a narrow percentage of my holdings. That might be because I no longer keep fiat, I have converted it all to Bitcoin.
I wonder if encouraging holdings might not be an argument in favor of moving to a channels based system? Bitcoin without people holding, without people willing to be exposed to volatility, is something of a hot potato, being tossed from one person to another: merchants instantly liquidating to fiat, making the volatility self-sustaining. If we could encourage more people to stop tossing the coins around or to slow the velocity of the tossing, maybe the volatility problem would lessen? Of course there are people in the world who live paycheck to paycheck, who have no developed savings. But I wonder if that is who the currency should target as a sustainable market. Of course it is laudable to make a currency that is great for all people, but the first goal should always be to be sustainable in the first place and not just take that for granted?

Miner reward is proportional to risk. The reason you want a big miner reward is that you want a big betrayal cost if the miners screw you by double spending against you. 
If you want a bigger miner reward penalty, all you have to do is to wait longer. So let's say the current level of fees only double to $50k/day over the hundred years it takes for the subsidy to go away. This means then you should wait at least one half hour for every $1000 spent in your store
The more reward, the faster, up to a point and mitigated by your preferred safety margin

1. Compact blocks avoids re-sending the same transactions as confirmed when nodes already have the transactions sitting unconfirmed (assuming everyone is already in sync)
2. Avoiding a re-send saves around 1mb / 10 minutes, a block is condensed into around 10-20kb just to confirm which of the present transactions are confirmed and the other block data
3. Segwit blocks could add like 1mb every 10 minutes to a node's sync traffic, so a compact block could work to counteract that
This is a long anticipated optimization that should help with scalability issues encountered as blocks grow in size: big picture we want to address all low hanging fruit optimizations that have been discussed for a long time and this is one of those obvious improvements

Multibit doesn't follow the reference client in how backups work, so if you used a new address, you have to refresh the backup every time. Bitcoin Core creates many addresses reserved for future use so that a backup is also backing up future coins. Multibit doesn't do that.

We already have sidechains, but that's really just because the term sidechain is very broad and can be almost anything, like "hard fork". If you mean "pegged merge-mined sidechains" there are three barriers to them being implemented:
1. Miners have to agree to merge-mine (they did this with namecoin) (a sidechain could use another security model if it wanted to, like proof of stake or something)
2. CSV needs to activate, making way for SegWit to activate, plus these need network support
3. Segwit opens the door for a new script to exchanging coins with a sidechain, there are various proposals for what that exactly looks like. I would think relative lock times and ending malleability would probably help simplify things too, although I don't know for sure
And we need some good ideas for sidechains. So far the only idea for sidechain that has general agreement as being a good idea is a better, more realistic system for testing upgrades to the main chain. I like the idea of just pulling all the altcoins into sidechains, just so that they have to compete on their technical merits and not on the "pump and dump" model.
We could roll out sidechains script support without CSV or SegWit, and SegWit and CSV could independently activate, but that would go down a different road from the general thinking of how to continue with planned upgrades

This is false, Gavin deliberately made up this role and there is evidence in his own words that this is the case


Why didn't Gavin ask for private correspondence? Wouldn't Gavin have said, "he said to me things that only Satoshi would have known", instead of "he sounded like Satoshi", had there been any actual private information shared? The answer might be then, well Craig would not want Gavin to have real proof because of the story embargo. But this guy already said he is Satoshi to Gavin, so Gavin can already claim he is Satoshi. And private information between two people, maybe Gavin is making that up, it's not real proof, so really Gavin would have nothing if the real Satoshi had offered it, since no one else could have verified it. And that would be pretty trivial to provide if he had access to the old emails or even just remembered them, remembered some factual detail that was not on the public record.




At least Gavin thought to ask for this, if only to get Wright's strenuous denial


Very very telling that he describes those as taking it over. Where is Pieter Wuille? Mike actually only made like 3 commits to the project total
Craig says multiple different stories to different people as to why the proof is wrong:


So he signed it, but they changed it


No he didn't sign it, he wasn't allowed to?


A new story, that does not make sense, all private keys are separate


Another story, now the UK is after him for terrorism funds?
I see very little evidence of anything in this post. I have tried to document all of the known evidence and history of the Craig Wright claim here:  
I went through the whole post and I don't see really anything new :(

Their arguments are disingenuous from start to finish. 
The big criticism of SegWit used to be that it would take too long. That it would take a while to code up and test, that wallet authors would take a while to integrate it, that people would need time to get SegWit outputs. 
Now slowly but surely we are accomplishing those goals. Now they move the goalposts, to say that the developers making the Bitcoin Core software are evil somehow. It's reached a point of absurdity because they've run out of excuses.

There's no way to make a perfectly decentralized system where every interest is perfectly balanced. 99% of the Bitcoin ecosystem is centralized and has conflicts of interest because these are people with human frailties and desires doing the work not monks or artificial intelligences. The hope is for a stable equilibrium where people find common interests to promote the general cause.
Bitcoin gives a path through centralization and conflicts of interest though because the software itself can be neutral, and you can see that a new version remains neutral, or you can just opt to avoid installing a new version. It would be excellent if there were more other developers, or if developers didn't need to think about their own interests and could devote their lives to Bitcoin and divorce themselves from all worldly desires, but that's not very reasonable to expect.

Low fees can simply mean someone is willing to wait a long time for a confirmation
That's perfectly normal, like if an exchange processes lots of small deposits and they want to reduce their fees for future high value withdrawals they can try to bundle together the small deposits at a low fee rate so that when they process a future withdrawal that has to go quickly and reliably they will send it at a high fee rate but with fewer inputs, so much cheaper

It makes sense, this was a real challenge for the initial bcash nodes as many were initially isolated from their network.
Unfortunately 2x has chosen to steal the name and user agent of Bitcoin Core, and to use the same ports and addresses. It will make for a messy experience for services, especially as they have not implemented replay protection .
I have nothing against people wanting to create their hard fork altcoins, but when they deliberately do it in a way to cause disruption to themselves and the Bitcoin userbase, it requires some response to minimize these problems.

The principle proof of stake issue is that without a specific cost to create a double spend attack, merchants cannot really rely on a quantifiable incentive against them occurring. Even more troubling, given a disagreement between multiple competing chains, stakeholders have no need to only select a single chain to vote for, making for a potential voting deadlock. This issue is known as the *nothing at stake problem* and no direct solution has ever been suggested.
A critical problem with proof of stake is the issue with defeating a fifty one percent attack. In a proof of work system, a nuclear option to prevent miners betraying the user base is the option to simply alter the proof of work to shake up the composition of miners. In a proof of stake system, miners and owners of the currency are equivalent, meaning that the alteration of the stakeholders requires massive and complex disruption to the composition of coin ownership.

Bitcoin is about voluntary cooperation, not forcing people to do what you want.
SegWit is important but so is remembering that miners can never ever be trusted as infallible central authorities because their interests are separate and distinct from user interests.

If there's no cost to voting you can vote for all options and you never reach a resolution. It's called the "nothing at stake" problem. There are lots of other issues.
One is called "range attacks" which is when someone does something like getting a big stake, selling his stake, then he presents an alternative version of blockchain history where he didn't sell his stake that's longer, giving him back control of the blockchain without losing anything.

There was a contract using Ethereum where people pooled their money into something like a multiple signature fund, but with complicated logic about how it could be spent. Someone found a loophole in the logic and spent all the funds to himself.


There was an issue in the logic of the smart contract where someone could spend the money to himself. They may or may not have intended for the logic to say that, but the computer doesn't understand intent and it let him take the money.


The contract stated that money leaving the system could not be re-spent for a month, so it is sitting in place for a month cool off period.


All the money went to one place, everyone can see it


The only relationship is a validation of Bitcoin's more cautious nature when it comes to smart contracts. Open-ended and widely varied smart contracts are not encouraged, and Bitcoin contracts deliberately are designed in way to make them straightforward, which should hopefully help prevent this kind of error, if it was an error.
If we think of the Blockchain as a neutral platform, it should not matter if a smart contract has an error, because there is only the code, there is no judgement of users, there can be no errors, only what is and what isn't. Even though that is the goal, this is an ongoing effort and here is a reminder of what happens when that neutrality is tested and human subjective decision making comes in to override math.

If the variable defining the limit is $howBigBlocksAre - and miners choose $howBigBlocksAre - then miners choose the limit


The half points only reduce the introduction of new supply, and the impact is muted more and more with every half point. This isn't about Econ 101, this is about Math 101


If you wait until the very last second for fees to take over, then you hit a wall head on when the fees do go away. If you slowly introduce fees over many years, it's not a shock that they exist.
Fees have existed for many years for Bitcoin. There are much much bigger costs than fees. If you tell a person they could easily lose half their savings just to volatility, they might not care so much about paying $0.20 in fees every week.

Fees and waiting for confirmations are mentioned in the Bitcoin white paper so you must not have done your own research


Broadly speaking there are some rich pockets that want to have more influence over what happens in Bitcoin and be able to tell the Bitcoin Core development team what to do without paying them, and they have used Blocksize as a wedge issue to try and achieve that objective.
The Blocksize issue is basically how fast and how precisely to increase the block size, there are infinite opinions on that subject, so there aren't really two sides, there are many sides.


The Lightning Network is a proposal to make the experience of spending your Bitcoin at merchants faster, more secure, cheaper, more private. Transacting on the Lightning Network should reduce the scope of the problem of improving the Blockchain to handle everything and let it focus on the most important functionality of the Blockchain as a first priority.
I've written in more detail about the Lightning Network and why it is desired and problems with it over here:

No one can say for sure because it depends on people agreeing on it. The final reviewed and updated merge is ready in the code, but the other day final checks were asked to make sure it is a good merge to push into Core.
CSV also needs to activate, which seems to be at 95%+ and fine to activate, but there is a signaling period of two weeks and then an activation delay of two weeks
Bitcoin Core will release 0.13.0 pretty soon, it can't have SegWit because it is not a point release and they don't put soft forking code in non point releases by policy. So they need to prepare and release it which would take some weeks, but that should overlap with CSV
0.12.2 and 0.13.1 would probably have the soft forking code, prep that and make release candidates, release those - network needs to update to that
Then wallets need to support SegWit and funds need to go into SegWit utxos
Then later we need to use the new SegWit address type and go through a round of updates for that

Little recap on the esteemed members of this organization that seeks to represent Bitcoin. Normally when you make this many screw ups, it's a death knell. In this case it seems to be a zombie organization the just refuses to acknowledge that it has no place this world.
Founding member and Vice Chairman of the Foundation Charlie Shrem [pled guilty]( to violating US monetary regulations by knowingly conspiring with a drug market money dealer to exchange Bitcoin with fiat currency through his platform.
Founding member Peter Vessenes was seen to have a [potentially corrupt relationship]( with another founding member Mark Karpelès. This issue manifested itself [in a lawsuit]( between Peter and Mark Karpelès, neither stepped down from their Foundation Board positions during the course of the lawsuit.
Foundation director Brock Pierce faced his own [legal troubles]( including accusations of sexual misconduct with his employees, [paying tens of thousands of dollars]( to settle out of court. 
Founding member Mark Karpelès presided over one of Bitcoin's greatest disasters: the collapse of the MTGox exchange. He was later [charged with embezzlement of funds]( with misuse of company monies including [payments to prostitutes]( A very [large number of Bitcoins were lost]( to their owners due to the dramatic failure of the exchange. Before co-founding the Bitcoin Foundation at age 24, Mark had been convicted of computer related fraud multiple times, and was a [fugitive from justice]( of a one year prison sentence from a French trial in absentia.
Founding member Roger Ver [pled guilty]( to sending unlabeled explosives in the mail and improperly storing fifty pounds of explosives in a residential apartment. He served ten months in prison. Later he was found to have [abused his administrative privileges]( on the Blockchain web wallet service to settle a personal problem by publicly revealing information about a user in an attempt to pressure them.
Foundation Law &amp; Policy Chair Mike Hearn very publicly quit Bitcoin, and went on a media tear. He proclaimed [Bitcoin to be a failure]( to mainstream news outlets, shaking confidence in the currency.
The Foundation's Chair of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Legal Advocacy Committee Brian Klein was [found to be working with Josh Garza]( the notorious PayCoin scammer who was [later formally charged by the SEC]( for operating a Ponzi scheme.
The MMMGlobal Ponzi scheme was directly granted a [Silver membership]( to the Foundation. Gavin Andresen [claims to have not known]( however the [website of the scheme]( directly offers impossibly high returns, and Gavin's lengthy involvement in Bitcoin should have made him well aware of this type of scheme. A Google search for the scheme reveals the [Wikipedia page]( for the organization, a page which contains Ponzi scheme in the title.

There's no good way to measure code in "more" and "less". It's like saying what is a better book, the longer one or the shorter one? Well that is just too simple to make any statement


Core has stated that they consider that it is not a good idea to do an elective hard fork unless the activation for it is in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.


I'm not talking about average. I'm talking about maximum fee for a normal transaction. This is around $0.10


In the real world there are many other costs that slow down growth of Bitcoin other than a $0.10 transaction fee. Exchange fee, cost to learn software, there are many many costs. There is no point to consider only one cost and not the others.
@_date: 2016-06-13 06:29:18
You don't really have "your" address at all. You are using Bitcoin by proxy through Coinbase. All your coins are belong to Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:50:32
Most everything requires giving out a bunch of identity verification documents, so if your guardian will help you, I think that's your best bet. Once they send you coins to your separate wallet, like Electrum, you don't need to deal with any service that will care about your identity or age.
@_date: 2016-06-11 02:37:10


You can make a specific type of wallet in copay called a shared wallet. You can share it with yourself on another device. If the other device is not present to sign off on the transaction, even someone who steals your computer cannot spend the funds
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:53:11
Quite unpredictable, it really depends on what the server operator does, which is opaque. Generally speaking it should be uncommon based on empirical observation, but logically speaking nothing prevents it from happening.
If you know the CoPay server operator, or you run one yourself, you might be able to make a more informed choice.
You could always just run received payments through a Bitcoin Core node, then re-send them on to yourself on your CoPay wallet, that is what I do, except with Electrum

u/Bitcoin_Charlie has publicly ruined his integrity
- He started the Bitcoin Foundation that tried to put Karpeles, Ver, Gavin Andresen, and Mike Hearn in charge of Bitcoin
- He says that what the miners decide are the rules of Bitcoin, when it is the users who decide. We don't need to make the case to miners because the miners don't decide what the rules of Bitcoin are.
- He shills a non-open-source wallet which is a very bad idea for coin storage
- He's a straight up convicted criminal
- He signed 2x but now wants to go back on it
- He tried to start a new scam ICO after getting out of prison
Trust takes a lifetime to earn and a second to lose. At every opportunity Charlie has proven himself to self promote and be greedy rather than to do the right thing. Even his friends like Ver hate him.

I agree with a blocksize limit raise. Of course I agree with having a democratically elected leader, now which one do we choose?
The old chain is still viable, if people want it to be viable. There's also the danger of the new major chain switching back, like if the miners saw the market tank they could change their minds. Both clients would accept the switch back if just a single pool changed their mind
I admit there is a fee trend upwards, but it is too gradual for any rash action. We could still compromise with a hard fork a year out and not see too high fees, from purely speculative read of following the trend lines (I don't like to do that because higher fees create more market opportunities for guys like changetip to gobble up some of the market for transactions). Certainly nothing that only gives a month of warning. Gavin himself is on the record saying at least a few months of warning should be given to merchants and full node operators that they will need to switch or adjust
Peer to peer means no middlemen, no trusted third parties, no lock-in. Requiring a data center makes it easier to get regulated or get hacked, and it means you sacrifice your privacy to whoever has access to the data center

Blocks aren't full on weekends, but on weekdays they are getting much more full. There is strong, real pressure and progress forwards, and because there are real fees we know that these are real use-cases and not just a few people wasting space: 
SegWit should help to provide new use-cases for weekend transactions, such as wallets automatically balancing payment channels opportunistically. Bitcoin Core has some updated logic in development to more intelligently estimate fees given these weekend lulls.

Just a friendly heads up that it's a bad wallet.
Here are some more details of its problematic history 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:52:15
The reason they will want to stop it will be the lack of replay protection. Exchanges during BU loudly demanded it, then they demanded it again from BCash, they will also demand it from 2x
This is because they can lose money via replay attacks, or their customers can lose money, and they will also have huge support issues and engineering costs associated 
The reason 2x makes no sense is because wishing your opponents were dead or don't exist doesn't work. We are here and we are going to keep bitcoining and there is nothing you can do about it
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:26:35
Why give in to irrationality? SegWit is 2mb blocks, and it is safe to roll out. A HF adds nothing and just gives in to an irrational change. Bitcoin development shouldn't be irrational.
HFs are actually still more dangerous because of the chance that nodes do not go along with the change. This way, it's completely opt-in. The fact that the miners haven't signaled for SegWit yet event though most nodes are ready for it proves that rolling things out in a HF is much riskier, even with an activation threshold, because you can't predict what people will do. If there were a 95% segwit HF but the nodes did not accept it, then we'd have 2 coins and people would lose money.

- Fees aren't paid per transaction, they are per byte, making that stat useless. I pay half a penny by just using cores default fee estimation, it's easy. It always, always confirms. Try it yourself, or look at the data which shows 90% confirm rates within 6 blocks for even super low fees, much lower than $0.05 to $0.40, when using the median and not the average.


How long can fees be going up fast for and still not reach a penny? SMH. What kind of idiots buy your bullshit? Oh right I remember, your clients are people who can't do math and altcoin suckers

2x is nothing, it's just the same stupid plan that they've been trying for years now to attempt to force people to change their consensus rules.

I think that the Lightning Network is getting ahead of the advantages of just simple payment channel improvements.
The lock that you mention is only in the case that your channel partner totally stops cooperating. If you had a payment channel with BitPay, you could still spend money from that channel on the Blockchain as long as BitPay didn't go offline. And they couldn't take your money.
Do you see any other methods to scale past 10x other than payment channels or waiting for Moore's Law / network and computing type things to get better and doing on-chain capacity increases?

The problem is that Ver is paying people to stop the block size increasing and his stated reason is that he has personal problems with the Bitcoin Core developers.

Now you are just making up stories, trying to smear Blockstream. Remember when you said this? Oh it feels like so long ago


Hmm I guess rules only apply to other people, not to you


If you don't want to push anything on me, just live and let live then? I feel like Core is the best option, the vast majority of the network and hashing power seems to agrees with me, let us make our own decisions?


Progress will continue whether there is made up histrionics or not. Probably better without them

Yeah precisely, it's a currency: nothing new about that


No ISPs control the transfer of funds


It would be much better if everyone agreed on a standard. There have been many expensive mistakes due to this problem, like that time the US sent an expensive probe to Mars and it died because of a mistake in Metric conversion. That is real human progress held back because we couldn't agree on a standard.


Yeah it depends on your point of view. If you are the type of person who thinks freedom is a fundamental good, then it's good. If you don't care, then Bitcoin is not important for that benefit.

For the subsidy portion, the money comes out of the pockets of all the existing holders of Bitcoin, as their coins are devalued
It's only 12.5 coins now
The rest of the reward are fees, which are paid by people transacting in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-01-29 02:36:03


A 95% miner consensus to create more coins for themselves? Probably a low chance. Would people still stick to the 5% even if miners held their hash power for ransom and demanded more coins? Quite possibly. Miners do not control Bitcoin. Some people want them to, and they are building a coin for themselves where that is a reality for them, but it's not related to the real Bitcoin that currently exists.
@_date: 2017-01-04 04:41:05
Yes, you pay a higher fee, it requires storing more data on the Blockchain: linking up all of those 0.1 BTC transactions together.
If you send them all to one address though, the next transaction fee would be a normally priced transaction fee.

You forgot to give a reason. There's no reason here. That's why I think it's irrational.


Actually, this is incorrect. The implementations are almost identical and in fact to be safe against replay attacks there would have to be a lot of additional extra hopefully unneeded safety code added.


Feelings are a very poor way to run development, and are not rational.


We've done it before, it's not a high bar. What we're doing is rewriting the rules of the currency, it better be difficult: every protection that Bitcoin gives including the 21 million cap are protected by the consensus rules of Bitcoin. If those are easy to change, Bitcoin is worthless.

The pointy haired boss approach doesn't work if you are building open source software. You can try telling the engineers to do what you want, but they will just tell you to get lost.
Normally pointy haired bosses also tend to screw things up in search of short term profits. They don't care about making a sustainable solution or about the quality of the product. Steve Jobs by all accounts was an exception to that rule, obsessing about internal quality and not just what looks shiny for marketing.
@_date: 2017-01-29 03:48:28
That's misinformation. The older software as you put it was deliberately coded with this capability, as evidenced by replaceable NOP codes, many previous soft forks, and clear announcement of this policy. You're simply lying: there's no "tricking" going on, this is deliberately how upgrades happen (P2SH, CSV, CLTV, etc) and how they were designed to happen.

Roger Ver and his paid team are busy [making up fake information about this failed hard fork](


Orphaned means the block is reorganized out by a longer chain. This block was flat out rejected as being invalid. It's an **invalid** block, it's not an orphan/stale block as they are calling it.
Roger Ver's paid moderator of rbtc and operator of the offending mining pool [offered this revealing statement](


Bitcoin Unlimited didn't even announce the issue to their user base or the network, a serious bug that could *and did* cause people to lose money. That we even know about this issue at all was because hours after it happened Core developers looking at network logs noticed it happened: the spread of the block amongst Core Nodes was limited because nodes will not relay invalid blocks.
Bitcoin Unlimited has not in fact fixed it, instead they have advised Bitcoin Unlimited miners to mine deliberately smaller blocks so that they don't accidentally go over the limit.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:27:37
No, you'll have to be online. LN wallets are hot wallets
Think about it this way, who keeps track of the payment when you do an offline payment? It is the nodes, and the shared Blockchain. That is a shared, limited resource so it must be expensive. 
LN only works and is cheap and fast because the only resources being used to track individual payments is your own computer.

Well would you believe that the node operators have a cost too? If their cost rises too high maybe they will seek an alternative and Bitcoin will no longer be decentralized?


Point to me where on the roadmap an economic argument is mentioned. It only discusses technical features. Also, it does include scaling on-chain


You don't get to decide that for other people. Let everyone else make their own risk analysis. From my perspective, giving Bitcoin over to the hands of terrible people who don't care about decentralization would be one of the riskiest things that could happen
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:34:40
Yes they are an exchange. Basically you don't want to store funds there because it is what is called a custodial wallet and it means they could steal or freeze your money, which would be pretty lame

It's an efficiency improvement, not a fix. The goal of the fee is to prioritize. More information, better prioritization. If a hospital had to triage patients based on looking through a dirty window, they wouldn't do as good of a job of keeping patients alive.

I'll amend it, ok it's not the same as a view source 
the software published in those repositories is often not the same as what Blockchain serves up to users though. Blockchain had a history of not having a license, so I was going off of that and I didn't see a license mentioned anywhere
and it fails to include a major missing component which is the server, so half the code is not public?
I didn't see the license hidden away there though, so I amend my statement. The client side code is open source
@_date: 2016-06-17 07:11:36
That the objective of better money is largely orthogonal to block size. That there are more ways to transact than just the Blockchain, so its limits on transacting don't really limit the money in any fundamental way in the long run

If you destroy the private keys definitively the coins are lost yes.
It's possible to create new Bitcoins by changing the consensus rules of the software, but that would be a hard fork and those are difficult to coordinate around contentious changes because people have to opt-in to them.
Hopefully in the future there will come a time when everyone can run a Bitcoin miner and take a little of the mining rewards, as the mining hardware technology becomes more commoditized over time it should become more widely available.

It has a big impact. On the 18th the median block size was 998kb, but the average block size on the 18th was 867kb

@_date: 2016-06-09 01:51:35


Hopefully not likely yes, but the defense against a 51% attack is to make it as unprofitable as possible so having the nodes reject a soft fork roll back is part of that

The main defense against these attacks is a full node
Get your full node up and running today, that's something everyone can do.
2x is the latest in a long line of attacks, starting with XT, the plan to place Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn as dictators of Bitcoin
Then came Classic, where u/jgarzik teamed up with a white supremacist and some drug abusing brothers who went on to support the Ethereum Heist.
Then came BU which insanity you can see playing out live with their new airdrop scamcoin.
Jeff Garzik is back with 2x. He's long tried to turn Bitcoin into a "banking establishment coin", with his claims to want PayPal BTC and Fidelity Bank Bitcoin. He does not care about decentralization. That's fine, but his lies and rejection that others do care about decentralization are outright criminal.
We will fight this attack off as we have fought all the others. It will just take our full nodes and the commitment to use them.

@_date: 2017-08-13 05:35:10
It depends on what you want.
If you want a centralized coin where decisions are made behind closed doors and there isn't a vibrant open source development process, you may prefer b2x coin. b2x is about representing the interests of the type of people who regularly blow $3000 on tickets to meetings like the closed door meeting in NYC for SegWit2x, the meeting where even the authors of SegWit were explicitly banned from attending. 
If you want a coin that has a large open source community and focuses on decentralization as a top priority, you will want Bitcoin. Bitcoin is about decentralized consensus and making deliberate, measured improvements with peer review in an open setting. 
It's your choice. Compare the repos, compare the mailing lists, compare the track records, decide for yourself.

It should come down to the market. 
Anyone can make a hard fork, the difficulty that 2x will have is convincing the world that it's a good idea to let miners set consensus rules by threatening businesses with disruption and 51% attacks.
So far a lot of the NYA signers (maybe most) have dropped out to some degree under the pressure to list bcash 
At the very least this means they will continue to list bitcoin, they may try to rename it for a while but that doesn't really change anything 
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:35:22
There are no "Core" coins, there are just bitcoins
This other airdropped bcash coin is not bitcoin
Altcoins come up with a lot of slick marketing pitches to make you think they are new and improved, but you cannot beat the real thing. 
Even if you try to dress up your bastardized stolen copy in the same name and colors, anyone who is not a total rube will quickly suss out the difference

That destroys the basic security guarantees of Bitcoin. If proof of work cost is not closely related to reorganization attacks, the merchant has basically no idea how many confirmations to wait because the cost to the miner to scam is unpredictable

One thing that makes it better all around is that it is open source - the project is vetted by various developers and has lots of contribution, including from Bitcoin Core developers
Another thing that I like about it is that it offers a multi-signature 2 factor authentication mode, so that even if your computer is compromised and the computer key is stolen, your funds are not spendable

I think they are both good. Electrum is more of a vibrant open source project but myTrezor is obviously made specifically for the Trezor so you can trust it to be comprehensive. 
Websites are always a bit of a risky proposition because what if you are being phished or Trezor is taken over by evil software developers or hackers, but you still have to confirm things on your device anyways. 
I'd say cold storage use myTrezor and hot wallet use Electrum

You should get a good CPU, there are a lot of signature operations.

The signaling is meaningless by itself, miners could just signal without really enforcing
So miners would have to start sabotaging Bitcoin and therefore the value of their block rewards and they still would have very little to gain because signals can be faked

Electrum lets you choose your own fee but you shouldn't mess around with it unless you know what you're doing because the potential savings are small and the potential you'll screw it up are high. If you do use your own fee be sure to turn on RBF which will let you fix the fee if your transaction gets stuck

Their goal is to kill Core not to make any meaningful difference. If you've been around for a while you will see they have had this goal for quite some time.

A hash makes a number for a set of data. The miners change the data randomly over and over to create a new number. They've done this random number thing like 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times so far. They do it a lot. 
The number they make is within a large range. But they must produce data that hashes to a number within a smaller target range. The target range adjusts about every two weeks. 
Generally they can collectively produce numbers in the range at a rate of 144 per day.

Because everyone's privacy is linked through the graph of transactions, a weak point among your peers means weakness for you too. 
I would take this with a grain of salt though, it's basically Peter Todd's role to worry and make noise about these potential problems. If we're making standards for Bitcoin, lets not be afraid to evaluate them critically to make sure we're not making bad ones

Bitcoin is about data, it can flow over anything, not just ISPs. Encryption would also make what you propose quite difficult. Bitcoin data is not very large, it's easy to spread around.


The proposal is for a new standard, with a standard you kind of have to just pick one.


I didn't say it would be easy
For the large part there is agreement about measurement. Even in the U.S. the use of metric is quite common in scientific fields. And practically speaking there are only a few very common systems for the entire world, I could certainly imagine within 100 years that the U.S. would convert to metric.
As far as people embracing freedom as a natural good, well that's just about assumptions. You have to start with some assumptions for your objectives, like why do you want to be happy when life without pain has no meaning? Everyone has different objectives, the objective of Bitcoin is freedom.

Not to mention that simple math proves that it's physically impossible to allow unlimited free transactions
Anyway the miners themselves implemented their own anti-free policy, even against Bitcoin Core's suggested system of allowing free transactions. A miner can allow free transactions in his block if he wants to, nothing stopping him

The XT guy left, sold his coins, went to work for a fiat company, then publicly said Bitcoin was a failure, that nodes would fail catastrophically when blocks got full, and that the upcoming 0.12 version was going to be garbage and let people steal money from stores
He did that at around $240 - now it is $680, most of the network is now on 0.12, no node failures happened when blocks got full, no stores have reported stealing, make of that what you will

I think you have the wrong sub
This is not @_date: 2016-06-10 04:52:43


At previous points, when the value of the network was less, there were more nodes. How do you explain that?


My point is that the developers have been making a technical case about what the network can do, not related to economics. You can't argue economics against a technical case, it's like being mad at gold for not having enough to give everyone their own bar, it's just being mad at reality.


My position is that others can do what they want: anything they want. Your position is that others should change the software they run. 


I'm not saying there is a negative correlation, that's a straw man. I'm saying that increasing the cost on node operators, given a graph of node operators willing to pay $x cost, would mean fewer node operators. It's purely a simple logical conclusion


But the plan I advocate does call for 2mb blocks in 18 months, so there is no contention there?


Can you name examples of these use cases that are shut out of the system that would feel the cost of switching to another system would be justified if they have to pay 1/2 of a penny for a transaction fee? It may be that I welcome those use cases being eliminated, as I may not value them in the system: like storing Lady Gaga videos on the blockchain, I don't think every use case is created equal

I think the "argument" started there when he wrote "CONpanies". If you want to shut up points of view that aren't just an echo of your own you should try Roger Ver's forum, that's what he made it for
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:34:32
Looking at the source of this link I thought it would be useless, but separation of concerns would be cool for Bitcoin.
For validating nodes to be effective, potentially we could use something like "fraud proofs". These things would let validating nodes send messages about validity to non-validators, but in order for this to work you need to make sure that the messages can't be used to just DOS non-validators by saying that everything is invalid.
Archiving nodes is something we already have today, and SegWit will potentially add a new class: signature archivers.
Relaying nodes could easily be abstracted out and hardened against attack, for example when some node operators complained that their nodes were getting DDOS'ed, if we had a separation system of relaying and validating nodes, they could just switch to a new relay and their validator would continue operating without impact.

@_date: 2016-11-25 18:41:24
The "receive date" is entirely arbitrary because it just means when one node first saw it, which can be random since nodes in the p2p network are just loosely connected
Sweep the change means you export the raw private key that the change address was generated from (be careful) and then go to a wallet that supports sweeping private keys (like Electrum) and then press "sweep private key" and input the raw private key.
This will make the total chain of transactions more valuable for a miner to include, so they will confirm it.

There have been transactions dropped for a long time. And it drops the least valuable transactions first, so we're talking about transactions that pay like a penny or two.


Anything's possible I suppose, but difficulty is designed to rise to match any increased income from miners, meaning increased equipment and electricity costs to match the increased revenue. Usually what happens in market situations is that the weaker competitors just die.


Or people could just pay an appropriate fee and not be inconvenienced at all.

The balances are stored on the Blockchain
There are thousands of possible words, so think about it like 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 x 2000 etc
It's really just an extremely large random number. From that number it is possible to derive lots of different random numbers, which is all that private keys are

No, because the transactions are made to use SegWit

@_date: 2017-01-25 03:24:42
Lightning transactions don't hit the blockchain, that's the point of it as it pertains to scalability: they don't consume any space.
LN doesn't require fixing tx malleability, but SegWit will just make LN and many other applications much easier and more reliable and better, so LN is currently coded on top of SegWit

CSV is CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY 
Bitcoin transactions are actually like little programs, with special keywords that say what can happen. A multi-sig transaction says like "need 2 of 3 signatures to spend". A CSV transaction would say, "can't spend until 3 days have passed". 
This is useful for Payment Channels which are great for micropayments or for fast payments but need a convenient way to return funds if cooperation fails
You should wait a while to use it for large amounts, because you want it to have a lot of network support (not miners, economically important full nodes need to enforce it). You can follow blocks to see if they support it on block explorers, it needs 95% of them supporting it to activate

The fees went up recently, abruptly - they didn't go up too much to be very expensive but the suddenness was unsettling. 
Bitcoin software isn't perfect and it doesn't always manage user expectations or provide service as expected
Unfortunately many unscrupulous people seek to use the deficiencies of Bitcoin as a weapon, created a the departure from calm collected reason that is so often on display.
If you are a holder of coins there's good and bad news. Fees went up a nickel or so, but your total Bitcoin wealth just doubled in a short space of time. Sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
@_date: 2016-06-17 05:24:25

Anyone can see these threats, if they look in the forums. I've been threatened myself. Because you only believe in your bullshit, you will deny deny deny things like the vote manipulation and threats because it doesn't match up with your bullshit.
When I say things, they are backed up with facts and data. There's a reason that there's a hundred plus devs working on Core and only one or two on these radical clients, it's because they can't attract anyone based on honest competition.
Hosting people in the forums who have these fake concerns, it's just another way you guys are lying. Trying to support people who are working to criminalize Bitcoin, that's not about authority, it's just something terribly wrong. You must be dead inside to not care about people's families getting threatened and you just laugh it off, say it's just emotional bullshit, whatever. To me, that's a terrible thing, totally unacceptable.
@_date: 2016-12-03 04:39:35
It looks like it has been confirmed
I recommend you get a wallet like Electrum, it has a feature called RBF where if your fee is too low and you would like your transaction to confirm more quickly you can just right click and adjust it to be the correct fee.

A full node's main job is to verify transactions where you are receiving money. If you control your private keys then it's very hard for people to take your Bitcoin and if you run a full node then it's very hard for people to send you fake Bitcoin 
As far as helping the network goes, the network needs more people receiving funds through fully validating full nodes because sometimes people are lazy and just hope someone else will make some noise if there are fake Bitcoins being sent around, but if no one checks for fakes then there's no one left to make noise
The best way to help Bitcoin is to help grow the economy: offer goods and services for Bitcoin, use Bitcoin as a store of value, pay for things in Bitcoin

I think there's too much interesting stuff to work on and too many other fires to put out to worry about things that will necessarily take a lot of thought and a lot of time to deploy, when easier and faster and bigger bang for the buck options are still available.
Why haven't we solved transaction privacy, why are we ok with people getting banned from Coinbase and Circle because of who they sent funds to? Why isn't the network traffic encrypted? Why are we using signatures that are 1.5x or even 2x larger than they need to be? Why can't we fold together multiple signatures to save space? Why aren't we preventing node analysis attacks that can map transactions to IPs? Why aren't we improving the Core GUI to use these new features like HD wallet importing, multisig? Why aren't miners committing to UTXO sets? Why doesn't Core use SPV mode while it's starting up? The list of things to do is endless and the list of developers is short

Bitcoin resisting miner control would prove that the network cannot be beaten by attacking or controlling the miners. 
It's not a desirable outcome I agree but it's essential to the value proposition that Bitcoin can resist attacks at its various weak points, which includes the large mining pools that control the majority of the hash power.
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:27:35
No, the network needs to upgrade, otherwise SegWit should not be used. Miners can roll back soft forks if they are done unilaterally, so what makes them safe is that the wider network will not accept a rollback if attempted

The biggest barrier to fungibility will be getting people to care. People have to start valuing their privacy or else the tools to protect it will not progress quickly.

Bitcoin can't be marketed like a consumer product because it is about a mission to rethink the authority of the state to dictate what money is, that's nothing like a new type of toothbrush.
A better type of marketing is to inform people about why they might want to value money that is predictable and not under a corruptable central control, how open standards make for platforms of innovation and growth, and how Bitcoin itself tackles these problems. Let people make their own decisions without selling them on something, if Bitcoin is right then people will decide on it themselves given a full and fair opportunity to do so.

Try for the best privacy option, if that's too much work use Bitcoin Core and make a new address every time you receive funds, if that's too much work yes use Electrum and make sure to get a new address every time you receive funds.
With local Bitcoins you can also search for people who will let you deposit at a bank or ATM with cash

No, I think Satoshi was going for making a digital currency grow to over ten billion dollars in less than ten years, I don't think he was trying to strangle anything.

LN is an extension of payment channels, which are very complicated and potentially buggy to implement when transaction ids are malleable because un-broadcast transactions that payment channels depend on depend on spending previous transactions, referenced by their id.
Also, LN eventually may benefit from larger block sizes as a safety measure against catastrophic LN failure: if LN fails all the transactions have to go on the blockchain and they need to do so in a timely manner, which may be mathematically impossible

Could organize some donation drives, like bundle up a big donation to make a big splash and promote the concept of using Bitcoin to help worthy causes.
There is even a cryptographic way to do this, you can set up a transaction that can be passed around with a set goal, like "we will raise 100 BTC". If the goal is not reached, the transaction cannot be posted to the network, this means people don't risk their money on anything less than a complete goal.

After a year SegWit will time out and then it can never activate.

This is an issue, the transaction data has been growing exponentially in fact
There will be a limit to the growth though, the total data is currently only allowed to grow by around 4gb per month, although soon that limit may be increased to around 8gb or more
Definitely if everyone in the world has to share space with each other, 8gb a month is a low limit, even 80gb or 800gb per month might be low. The solution to that would have to be improved software to use limited space more efficiently and improved hardware to make syncing more data less costly

- In a 2014 security issue with Blockchain's web wallet, it was discovered that random number generation was flawed due to bad code commit. White hat hacker Johoe was able to successfully obtain hundreds of Blockchain users' bitcoins by exploiting this vulnerability.
- Up until the end of 2014, the web wallet had a major security issue with the way that it dealt with failures to connect to its real time data service. When the connection failed, it would retry, but the retry would not be encrypted, allowing man in the middle attacks on the private wallet data
- In 2012, investor in Blockchain and Bitcoin personality Roger Ver was allowed to have access to the admin panel, which he abused to publicly reveal private information about someone whom he accidentally sent Bitcoins to in order to motivate them to return the funds. Through this incident, it was also revealed that Blockchain was recording and indexing user information against Blockchain queries, in a way that helped to make compromising user privacy much easier.
- The CEO of Blockchain Peter Smith revealed in a blog post in 2016 that his company is monitoring and compiling statistics about the nature and destination of transactions made by wallet users, indicating that users should not have an expectation of financial privacy in using the service.

I'm mostly ok with SegWit but...
1. There's no address format yet. No standard for how to tell people how to send you funds. Addresses just communicate data that is then unpacked and put into a transaction. It's like we can't decide on a domain name so the only way to use the website is using the IP directly.
2. There's an intermediate upgrade step where you can send to old style addresses because there's no new style yet. It's wasteful and will be extraneous once SegWit is adopted fully, but this is a system that is hard to change so cruft is not good 
3. It adds a new merkle root, making the old one extraneous, which is necessary for backwards compatibility. But the new merkle root itself might become extraneous in the future, it's not designed to be upgradable
4. It increases the block size by a huge step, which is not as cautious as I'd like. I'd prefer it if it increased the size gradually
5. The rollout uses miner signaling only and has a cut off date. This places too much focus on the miners signaling, when it's the users who ultimately control the network. If only 51% of miners support SegWit but 99% of the users support SegWit, why will SegWit not activate? A minority miner could do nothing but disrupt already unreliable SPV clients. I'd prefer a flag day ultimate trigger to show that the users are in charge and not have people be lazy and proxy this decision to a coordination between miners

I'd switch away from MultiBit to something like Electrum, but it should still work when SegWit activates.

It depends if it's consensus critical or not: peer network protocol can be changed easily, the protocol has flags embedded to indicate new features. 
If it's a feature that is about the state of the ledger, where everyone has to be in sync for obvious reasons, that would use a BIP 9 flag and a soft fork to deploy

There is a limited amount of space for transactions, so people will have to pay miners for the transaction space.
It's hoped that these fees will pay for the energy needed to provide chain with its security. Currently the fees alone have been hitting higher amounts than the block rewards did up until 2013
Even if you made the block reward zero tomorrow, the rewards of the current fees alone would still be higher than the first four or so years of Bitcoin's operation.

The point of a soft fork is to avoid a two chains, ETH/ETC like split where people can lose their money. So a simple hard fork like ETH/ETC increases that risk because it makes no attempt to deal with the other consensus.

No, it's very explicit that balance should be sought.
Instead of making node cost high without limit and tx fees low without limit, the system should promote medium node cost that lets a very wide range of people be validates and medium tx fees that let a very wide range of people use the Blockchain, promoting the decentralization durability of widespread nodes and the long long term financial robustness of tx fee revenue to pay for proof of work security

There's a limit on the number of transactions and there is a bidding process where people pay to get their transaction into the Blockchain.

From the perspective of a user who needs a reliable site for important monetary purposes, the relative difficulty of fixing BlockchainInfo platform bugs is irrelevant.
Even recently, aside from these downtimes where users are disrupted from access to their money, other problems persist such as the removal of an easy portability tool to export private keys, and even the old tool has been removed. Privacy issues also persist, with CEO Peter Smith making statements that the unnecessarily privacy invasive practices that Roger Ver abused are still present, behind the closed source of the Blockchain server.
I would love to recommend BlockchainInfo, it would be a great ally to Bitcoin. I'm not even prejudiced against client server setups or JavaScript implementations as I recommend CoPay. But in the present state and with its problematic history, I cannot in good faith recommend this service for anything more than trivial informational use.

It is cheaper to spam when spam is cheaper to send. That should be super obvious. There are two types of spam: spam that is wasting space and resources and spam that is trying to change the marginal price of blockspace. The spam that is trying to wasting space is cheaper if the fees are lower, which is what happens if the blocks are bigger. 
The spam that is trying to change the marginal price of blockspace is also more expensive if transaction fees are high, as I show with the simple million dollar transaction example.
And there is no reason that if it takes billions to spam at million dollar transactions that at dollar transactions it wouldn't take millions to spam. The logic applies at every level. The reason you think it doesn't is that you have incorrect numbers for the fee when blocks aren't full, which is not market based for many people who are simply setting random fees, which could be high or low but are basically just noise.
@_date: 2016-12-05 07:13:35

It's supposed to fuel smart contracts between people, so let's say we make some token that represents a debt, we could put that in Ethereum and then use Ether to pay fees to trade this token around. People already have layers on top of Bitcoin to do this though, or they just trust well known entities, and you can't get rid of all counterparty risk anyway except for in some boring very restricted gambling scripts, so it isn't used too much for real. And Bitcoin's proof of work dwarfs Ethereum's, so if you use the Blockchain to secure your smart contract you are getting way way way more security than Ethereum, plus the Ethereum community just randomly rewrites their chain anyway which makes the whole thing meaningless. It's like OneCoin, they use the name Blockchain technology to fool people into thinking there is something there when there isn't.

The mechanism they are attempting to use to force people has been to use a coordinated denial of service and an abuse of a security weakness in some Bitcoin clients.
They've been held off for the most part since people recognized this attack ahead of time and took proactive measures to defend against it.
Now they are attempting to defraud people into the hard fork by selectively showing information about the hard fork, false information about it and then hiding the true information and telling lies that the true facts are made up, because of conspiracy theories.
This fountain of bullshit is promoted by people like HostFat, the paid moderation team of rbtc, the forums Roger Ver controls, and an alliance with people like Jorge Stolfi or numerous altcoiners who want to see Bitcoin fail to pump their scams, who post regularly on his forums pretending they are concerned Bitcoiners.

There is a new chain and it includes the signatures. Where the old signatures used to be it puts empty data (for transactions spending funds sent to SegWit addresses). 
This is for backwards compatibility, the new transactions are basically the same as the old transactions but with some extra data added in from the new chain (the signatures authorizing the transaction) in a brand new field: the witness field (crypto jargon that means signature). That way old and new transaction types can live together and the new chain can even sync a smaller version of itself to old clients that will still make sense. 
This new chain is designed as a pure upgrade that could eventually totally replace the old chain format.

It's not so comparable because a lot of fiat is just imaginary based on leverage: your bank doesn't have enough money to pay back all its depositors. But those virtual dollars are still counted as part of the ten trillion figure. Bitcoin can be virtualized and lent, but it's different enough that I would hesitate to draw your direct comparison. With that being said: should Bitcoin become the currency of the world, in a configuration similar to what we have today, with only 21 million units available to 7 billion people, I think it's fair to say even one unit would be valuable, and 21 would be worth quite a good sum.

You could just avoid the soft fork, it will remain at 1 mb for you. Just take extra care when receiving funds: if there are transactions that seem non-standard to you, wait for extra confirmations.
Really I think you should consider pruning. The idea of Core as an all-in-one everything-to-everyone solution is impractical, we need to push for modularization and the initial block download is a prime target for improvement and specialization.
It makes sense for decentralization that people can easily host the network bootstrapping from their home computer, but you could shard that task so maybe 10 people on their home computers could spread the data collectively, reducing the storage burden of that role by an order of magnitude.

Larger blocks could change the economics of miners through propagation. Let's say 51% of miners were well connected to each other so that 8mb was nothing to them. And 49% had bandwidth that was a bit slower. This would mean that the 51% would win more "close" races where miners mine the same height block at very close times. This might matter only once in a while, but if it's even just happening one percent of the time that's still potentially like hundreds of thousands of dollars a month in missing revenue for the minority miners.

There should be some variance due to miner luck or lack thereof. For SegWit to be ready the real thing to watch is not the miners but the ecosystem. People on their full nodes need to be enforcing SegWit, otherwise the miners should not signal for it, because if people are not enforcing it we risk a chain split which is undesirable as it could lead to fund loss. Every care is taken to avoid that situation.

Bitcoin may split into two coins, starting from the same root. When you deal with an XT merchant you will spend XT coins and when you deal with a Core merchant you will spend Core coins. The coins you spend might be the same source of coins but spent in two places. Effectively the number of coins will go from 21 million to 42 million in a 2 for 1 split.
However this may not happen, if everyone stays in general agreement about what the block limit should be

This is not a good way to do things
1. you are reducing your privacy if anyone ever links that address to you 
2. if anyone ever cracks or hurts the encryption protecting tx signatures, you could be vulnerable
3. You're hurting the privacy of anyone you ever deal with, and of the network at large by making it easier to analyze
4. You're making it harder and more expensive to spend your own money. Since older tx are favored, by constantly cycling your address you are making it new again which means you will have to pay more
5. You might get your money stuck: if you pay a fee that is too low for one transaction, it could get stuck in the mempool and now you have to wait it out to do any more transactions
6. Your own security is overly complex for no reason, if you make a mistake you could be compromising your own keys

@_date: 2015-08-17 05:49:35
Bitcoin isn't really designed for next block confirmations, the next lucky miner could be annoying and just refuse to include transactions, there's little in place to stop that
Bitcoins scaling principle for more traffic is not to attract more mining nodes to gather more fees and make more blocks but rather to turn away traffic beyond a limit and triage based on transaction importance
It's like if uber had a limited number of cars on the street and they only raised prices depending on demand
It would be nice if the network could increase speed to keep pace with transaction demand but it's very hard to design that to work in a decentralized way

Anyone can make a hard fork happen. You can do it right now by changing a few lines of code. So that means "as soon as it becomes clear a hard fork will happen" is meaningless
Two chains existing simultaneously is not nonsense, it's what will easily happen: all that has to happen is a miner or two doesn't change their version. 
Why do you want a Bitcoin where the creation of 750/1000 blocks can change any rule in the entire system? This is a bizarre meme, that somehow miner voting at the arbitrary number of 750/1000 ensures that a fork can never be contentious

There seems to be two concepts that are being conflated.
The first concept is that the Bitcoin QT client can be forked and reimplemented by anyone. Aside from some small grumbling about how the code is the protocol and that this could cause unintentional hard forks or problems, everyone seems to accept that it's OK to fork the client code base and for people to run different versions of Bitcoin QT. Even core devs are running and publishing their own different versions, and there is work being done to separate the consensus code to make forking different versions easier without threatening a hard fork.
The second concept is that a hard fork represents a "vote" on whether consensus rules ought to be change. That calling for a vote has minimal harmful side effects and people can vote and the network can switch without issue. OK so if that's true, why can't hard forks be staged along the way as the network grows to need them? And if that's false, shouldn't the negative side of forks be weighed with the benefits inherent, shouldn't the possibility of harmful side effects be credited and talked about?
So far there haven't really been any planned hard forks at all where some clients were going to be phased out and not able to sync the Blockchain. When that has happened, it has been by accident, or to correct a potential bug where the behavior of the consensus code was non deterministic and thus created potential hard forks by default
I say this is a preemptive fork because no one is saying that the blocks are legitimately full "today". This is all planning for the future, especially the rise to 8 GB blocks. It's claimed that this hard fork will prevent the need for a future fork. So with this push Mike is saying: "we need to hard fork now otherwise we'll need to hard fork later and that's bad, but don't worry because hard forks aren't that bad except in the future where they are bad except if I am being a bad dictator then they are OK"

This is pretty similar to a Ponzi scheme - interest isn't just imagined out of thin air it has to come from somewhere.
If you want, you could setup a system where everyone traded their bitcoins for your country "liberty government"s coins. You can then declare that you will inflate the value of your liberty government coins by around 2% per year. Then you can reasonably pay people 1% interest and they might even be happy to get it (yay I'm making compound interest!)

So far I can't see a single fact about what they are doing that makes it seem like they want to design a centralized Lightning Network, or that sidechains will be a centralizing force. The biggest centralizing forces around today also seem to want bigger blocks (circle, bitpay, mining pools) so that actually makes me suspicious that they want bigger blocks to benefit their centralization, although that's just speaking to their motivations.

Miners don't control the decision, even if 100% of miners leave new miners can step in and mine new core blocks. The difficulty will adjust down to compensate

The normal way tx will work is they will be broadcast and picked up by both chains and you will be paying everyone 2x. As soon as a market is established to trade between the chains though, you'll want to stop doing that because you'll be losing money. That means that people will try hard to taint their coins, and you'll probably have some new services pop up that will help you taint your coins with XT or core flavor

- Depending on your point of view Bitcoin supply can be increased, but it requires the economic majority (which is hard to define succinctly)

XT also threatens more centralization, which means easier to be shut down or controlled by government or other central forces
More throughput capability doesn't mean it will happen, and most transactions are already offchain even now due to the long confirmations delay
There are already coins on the market with more centralization but very fast throughput, like Ripple. No one can predict the price of XT vs core coins.

I think your suppositions are not logical conclusions, more like guesses
Maybe people would jump to a higher hash rate chain, however that's clearly not always the case since the miners could introduce another hard fork that awarded them a million coins each and no one would use that chain no matter how much hashing power it had or how much it messed up the other network. There's some set of variables where people may jump, but I don't think there's a way to know where the line is exactly. Like why 75% and not 66%? It's just guesswork
@_date: 2015-08-29 16:24:43
It seems like the miners voting business is following a bad pattern where miners indicate support for things they don't actually really support. Like most miners now seem to be going towards BIP 100 (not that the miners are necessary for a hard fork but that's a given). There have also been a few blocks for BIP 101. However none of these blocks were actually made by miners running anything but Bitcoin Core, they are faking it, just like the BIP 66 fakeout where we had an accidental fork. 
There should be some other protocol for signaling support other than faking actual support

The scales of Bitcoin ownership are heavy with the short term trader. This kind of owner will flip into and out of Bitcoin as a form of gambling
A lot of the factors you mention may slow growth drastically
- more hash power actually means that the hash power is centralized to a degree which would make mining cartel action more likely
- vc investment in new firms has slowed and we may see the crest of this wave. The companies with huge funding are household names to us, but people still come here and don't know what coinbase and circle are
- there are debates about the security: that's why there's this BIP debate thing. The code base is always changing and the architecture seems solid but there are always small vulnerabilities somewhere
- people are talking about tx pressure but it's really a theoretical problem still, you can't do a 1:1 comparison with past tx because the fees were cut to $0.02 from $0.10
- governments often kill things with regulatory kindness. Many businesses are saying that the real cost of the Bitcoin regulation bill in ny would cost them $50k or more, and ongoing fees, now multiply that by every state potentially

There's no way to predict prices, especially in a clearly speculative market. It could go down because of the instability or stay the same due to people not even really knowing what happened or go up by proving in practice what was only known in theory

In my view price talk should be banned. But then people like you would be like, "I love it how you can't talk about the price" and other people would be like "Censorship is evil blah blah blah"
People aren't monks. If you are surprised or amused that people get excited when the price goes up and unhappy when the price goes down, you're very easily surprised

Altcoins are garbage
Litecoin: changed the proof of work algorithm, but coded it incorrectly in a way that the author of said algorithm calls a mistake, they've never corrected this issue. I think the author of the coin doesn't even work for a litecoin company, he works for a bitcoin company. Only one person has been working on it making minimal changes in months, if you don't count folding in changes taken from the bitcoin codebase.
DASH: not actually decentralized, uses centralized and therefore attackable and controllable "super nodes"
Ether: it's not even truly decentralized: centralized stakeholders can shut it down and/or control its use. It's like a much harder to use version of Amazon Lambda. 
Monero: based on a known scam coin (even the lead developer admits this) and the developers who work on it didn't even write it, the people who created it left. Those who continue dev on it say there is no reason to expect it to take off and that the reason they don't work on bitcoin core is that they are not qualified enough in crypto to contribute in any way (direct quote from the lead dev)
Namecoin: suffers from a severe squatting problem in the core design and a chronic lack of toolchain and developers, namecoin is used for very little in practice, even after many years. It has a good goal, but I'm not sure they can solve the squatting problem
Peercoin: not decentralized, can be attacked and shut down or controlled at its central point

I think it's not a problem because look at how loudly they are shouting against centralization now. If Lightning starts looking like it will be centralized, they will be revealed as hypocrites from their past statements. Also, I don't see this as a decision that has to be made today: a hard fork can happen at any time, so since we don't even have lightning network now, there's no need to compete with it yet.
Also I already see Bitcoin as highly centralized in certain areas. We have 2 merchant processors: Bitpay and Coinbase, what if they start requiring ID? We have 10 miner pools, what if 5 of them start requiring ID?
I'm more concerned with people stopping centralization that already exists than preventing new centralization that may or may not exist

If you wait until next year for XT to win or lose, you will get to pick the correct fork with the benefit of knowing which side won

I'm hardly going to convince you that you are selling a scam, but saying that Bitcoin claims "fast payments" is the same as Monero claiming "untraceable" is a straight up false equivalence. 10 minutes being fast might be a stretch and I do disagree with it, but it's not an outright falsehood and it's definitely not pitched as the raison d'etre of Bitcoin in the context of why does Bitcoin exist and why is Bitcoin valuable.
Untraceable and private is a joke, it only makes sense in a very specific crypto sense, in any large sense it is not true. Simple example: I withdraw $520 from my bank account and I send it over Monero to my weed vendor, there are millions of ways that transaction can be tracked back to you, so it is not private in a meaningful way. In fact there are so few legit users of Monero, just the fact that you used it all in a given space in time can reveal who you are. There are so many ways in which "anonymous coin" is a false promise, it shouldn't be promised any more than a "100% secure from being stolen" coin should be promised.
Even in a crypto sense, Monero is not a truly private, zero knowledge system. It resists tracing but it does not logically prevent it. That's just how I see Monero as a scam: Monero is pitched as anonymous, but purchases using Monero can still be identified. That means it should not have been pitched as anonymous.
Even pitching Monero as a lottery ticket is disingenuous. Lottery tickets are long shots, but they still pay out to someone. Buying Monero is more like buying an expired lottery ticket, and Monero team is trying to sell expired lottery tickets as if they are real.

How is this logical: "XT is just a hard fork, that's just how Bitcoin changes and that's normal, anyone can fork Bitcoin at any time no problem. We need to hard fork now to include more space even though it's not needed at the moment and we will include auto growth to 8gb space, because it should be future proof and we don't want a hard fork to happen again because of how destructive it is if people don't agree on it"
Mike sounds so hurt that his patches were derided for being buggy that he's trying to make caution in developing Bitcoin sound like it's a bad thing.

It's a good thought, but I think it would not be easy to create, the nonce you suggest would have to work differently than the real nonce and I'm dubious it would work
The other issue is that the more complex the basics of Bitcoin become, the more surface area there is for attack. I think we've seen this with SSL libraries, the design was such a clusterfuck, even though huge companies relied on SSL for everything they didn't bother to contribute except to add complexity to the requirements and make for a bloated codebase. This is an extremely common problem for protocols with "open" processes of improvement: everyone demands their pet feature, you end up with a mess at the end.
This is one problem with bitcoin, the devs can't afford to fuck up, but in a normal software project you might try tons of bad ideas and have lots of terrible bugs along the path towards a better version
I think that's the reason the core devs want to expand without touching Bitcoin. By building up (lightning), they can only fuck up their new apps upwards. And by building out (sidechains) they can only fuck up their new limited scope chains
This is understandable but it can be dangerous, it's similar to how Firefox developers shit the bed by saying "every new feature should be a Firefox extension first" and didn't bother to look at the core platform problem: their crap rendering engine.

No it will not wither and die. It will stay around, and there is no "become dominant" in blockchain software, the two incompatible chains do not even know about each other. After the fork there will be 2 ledgers. One will have one version of history, the other another version of history. Regular users will have one balance on one chain and another balance on the other chain.
This is just the meaning of the blockchain, it just means there's a file with a record of all the transactions. A hardfork means that the blockchains split into two chains, two histories of transactions

If you consider that normal fiat is a tax on your assets, and some people believe taxes are good because they let the government who collects those taxes do good things, then the logic is that fiat is good and competition for fiat is bad.
Plenty of critics are even paid directly from those tax dollars so they have a bit of a conflict of interest

For 1, there is no way to know that the stakeholders are different independent people. That means you are potentially entering a system in which confirmations are not substantially different from a single person with a central single database 
For 2, if you have to fall back to a proof of work when proof of stake falls apart, you haven't conditioned your network to handle this so the interests of the people with high amounts of hash power will be totally new and unexpected, and maybe not in line with the network. For example if you switched to Sha hashing pow, someone could easily direct a btc miner to you and own the entire decision of hard fork

What if the burned coins were returned to the market later? Like we know the block reward is a good mechanism, so take all the burned coins and reintroduce them in the halving after next halving point. So if the halving was going to hit 6BTC but there were lots of btc in the burn pool, it would bump up the block reward to 10 btc instead
No inflation, just rewarding later miners for the burns of early miners
The price problem is valid, but this could kind of set a sanity floor for things: if there really were billions trying to get their tx on the bc, then that pressure would have a valve at least: even if it were an expensive one.

That just gives the determination of when to actually break things over to miners.
It doesn't mean that a soft fork is the same as a hard fork.
It's entirely possible the miners will make breaking blocks before there is a solid consensus. I mean what you are saying is possible, and your point is valid, but it doesn't mean that you can say a hard fork and a soft fork are the same thing.
Keeping miners from having too much power is probably a good idea at the moment because there is so much centralization of power. It basically means hand over this decision to a handful of people.

The mining power may drop, but there will always be participants
They will get to take transaction fees, those are currently like $5-10k USD per day, either those will increase or the mining power will drop

- mining (creating confirmations) is done on specialized computers and collected by specialized operators, they could be infected with a virus but it's not super likely and miners aren't allowed to break the rules even if they want to: the network checks their work.
- the code is an open source project that anyone may contribute to or change. there are multiple groups and individuals working on it or on different versions of it. to increase the block size, every single participant in the network must agree to increase it, no one person can increase it

Nothing, but all the transactions on the blockchain are public, not only can the IRS see them, everyone else can too
@_date: 2015-08-21 02:40:18


Economic consensus is hard to poll. Don't tell me XT nodes count because that number is easily faked and is not representative of the greater Bitcoin population. Mining consensus is not relevant other than that the mining will get slower on the minority fork until the difficulty adjusts


So the likelihood of 2 chains for more than a part of a day is very small, and the likelihood of 2 chains where both intend to persist is irrelevant considering one will have the merchants on it and the other will be used 
solely to count the volume of sour grapes in la la land via dsl internet connections on raps.

gmaxwell likes 1mb (for now, and he's not really the most active dev on bitcoin-core) - 
His main opinion seems to be that keeping it at 1mb will somehow encourage node count growth, although that seems pretty specious because block size is only one factor in node count. 
I don't think any core dev really believes in 1mb forever, because the root of 1mb is based on a guesstimate of what current technology can handle as far as downloading and validating goes. The main argument in favor of 1mb forever in recognition of the technology question is that in 20 years there should be some semblance of a fee market in place to keep things secure, but with a market that has an overly inflated transaction supply the market rate of fees may be too low to provide much security.

There is no correct percentage. Miners should never be given the power to determine the core protocol rules, they serve the users not the other way around.
At best, a mining percentage check on a hard fork should be seen as a last safety veto vote (that would not veto if the users were truly determined), not as a method of determining whether or not there is consensus
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:00:57
Nicely shows how a hard fork is often misrepresented as stopping the shorter chain instead of splitting into two chains which is what actually happens.
If you actually believe more blocks means not altcoin, then the hard fork should reduce the difficulty target by 10x so it has blocks every minute, it will speed ahead in block count. Or change the hash pow to be easier, then you'll get more hash count

@_date: 2015-08-20 03:36:57
Generally my take on things is that markets trade too far on speculation and then pull back on concrete news. 
So it depends on the sentiment about the uncertainty: a good sentiment like "maybe Amazon will accept Bitcoin" would increase the price way high and then pull back once they actually announced the details and how many sales they were actually making. 
Good uncertainty is why startups often deliberately try to avoid making money: once they generate revenue there is a concrete number to ground the dreams of investors
But the reverse is true too, if the sentiment around the block size uncertainty is negative (which I think it is, not because of the size but because of the fork drama itself) then the price will go way down, even farther than it should, then spring back up if the drama is resolved

Yes trust is exactly the problem (and also since you can't buy or sell fractional shares then you have a small risk problem or you have to delay the purchase)
Maybe it could work in a p2p way where you could convince enough people to casually break the law that it wouldn't really be enforced. Even without the fractional component of your plan this could be good, many people are not allowed to buy shares or don't want the commitment of a brokerage.
Personally I'm too much of a coward to break the law in such an obvious way - even if I think the law is pretty bogus, but others might not be

Mike Hearn now looks like the zealot since someone on the other side admitted the block size should have a concrete increase plan, and they published said plan. Mike should now admit that growth is useful only if the full confidence in the lasting core mission is retained. 
Growth for growths sake is what brought us products like Google Plus, "we must have viral social growth or Facebook will destroy us". It's the poisonous culture of grow fast die fast Silicon Valley. Growth has to be founded on a core mission and the core mission of Bitcoin is the elimination of counterparty risk

No they are incompatible, it's a common misconception
1. XT will be built on a block that is deemed invalid by core. Core won't accept any blocks built on that bad block, all the blocks must be built on each other
2. Core will continue making blocks. XT wont' accept any blocks that aren't built on its fork block, for the same reason
3. Now we'll have 2 different versions of history. Depending on how many miners accept XT fork, blocks will go more slowly than normal for a while and then return to normal, but with 2 different and incompatible ledgers

1. Spammers don't sign their spam as spam, so there is no good way to stop it
2. The devs are not against a hard fork. They are against a controversial hard fork. If everyone agreed on it, they'd go for it

4. The proper way to defend against centralization is not to wait for bad things to happen and then back off. Adjustments after the fact can take years or never happen. That's why it's good to have principles and stick to them
5. Many people are opposed to lightning, mostly because they are misinformed or it goes against their agenda, but some people think it's not an organic way to grow Bitcoin and is an over engineered solution that won't work in practice

It's an open question, there will always be some base level of miners so there will always be some security but it might drop depending on the activity of the network

Another answer may be in a consortium of stakeholders paying for baseline security to protect the network

28,000 transactions / month - I consider myself at the top end of trying to spend Bitcoin whenever I possibly can and I spend about 2 times / week, or 0.28 times / day.

I don't believe that Bitcoin is inflationary or deflationary because those terms refer to government controlled money, Bitcoin is just a token with a limited number. To me that means it's neither getting more available or less available, it's a fixed amount of available.
I think people are assuming that Bitcoin token count is the same as Bitcoin money supply, which is an error, or that Bitcoin is destined to go up forever, which is also an error 
For the price: there is no predicting. It may go up or it may go down, it has less to do with token amounts than how the actual usage of Bitcoin plays out in the future, which is unknowable

Doesn't sound all that encouraging "a diversifying investment" to me. 
Fluffypony on the dev team of Monero


I'm not saying you can't write any cryptocoin code, but that's a low bar. 
My real issue with Monero wrg to Bytecoin is that it repeats the scam premise of Bytecoin. Scam means lies, and the Big Lie of Monero that is repeated over and over is "Untraceable". No coin can promise that, it's like saying Bitcoin funds "cannot be stolen". Imagine if "cannot be stolen" was the main pitch of Bitcoin right on the front page. It's technically true in a very small sense that no one can guess the random number that is the private key, but it's so misleading to be a lie. That's one reason why I consider Monero to be a scam.

The debate has nothing to do with block size anymore

In a 51% attack from the majority, B can switch proof of work to a different system, eliminating the 99% attackers. In 51% attack in A, what can be done, switch to proof of work?

There are two ways wealth inequality can happen. 
Imagine a group of 10 people on an island: they all have different skills but one guy is strong enough and smart enough to hunt and kill meat, which he trades to the others. As he has a good that others want and no one else can provide, he gets rich
After a while the islanders decide they don't like this setup and he has too much power over them. They collectively bargain with him to get him to pay back some of the cost of meat so that the political leader can distribute the payments evenly. The political leader decides to reward some of his friends a bit more so they also get rich, but still rewards everyone to keep people happy
In the first situation, Bitcoin can offer very little help. In the second it can help somewhat because it reduces the power of the political leaders to dictate terms to the hunter, although it does not directly stop this from happening at all
So Bitcoin can help some forms wealth inequality but not conclusively and it is not its mission, also wealth inequality is arguably not a bad thing: more poor people being born in India does not necessarily mean that rich people in Europe should now have less to balance things out

The real problems will be caused by the fork itself not the change. Bitcoin is not designed with a smooth contentious hard fork change system: it will be bumpy as some people will refuse to change to Hearn leadership and some people will not change until something breaks for them because of the effort involved. 
And the hard fork might not even hold, if it goes back to 1mb, all the tx on the 8mb fork will be discarded and people will have lost wages for work, payments for goods, etc. because of the uncertainty, people may just wait it out, hurting progress made to get people to accept and spend Bitcoin 
The contentiousness is the main risk, not the 8mb

Independent variables mean that you can't relate them. They don't depend on each other. Another fallacy you are saying is that the number of transactions is strictly given by the on chain transactions. But without the blockchain offchain transactions would not be possible, and there can be an infinite number of those. So by your own logic, bitcoin transactions would be infinitely cheap.

Making what up, that businesses in China accept Bitcoin? You're just constantly trolling, even when I post discrete examples of businesses in china that accept bitcoin you'll either find some reason why they aren't real or are some exception or just ignore the facts. You yourself can spend 5 minutes googling to find bitcoin accepting businesses OTHER THAN THE MARKETS WHO CHARGE FEES IN BITCOIN located in China:  -  - not to mention all the p2p trades like  for anything from alipay to amazon.cn gift codes
You're obsessively posting about the Chinese / making up garbage about China. These are direct quotes from you, from literally only the past week or so:
- By logic, bitcoin should have become worthless when the Chinese got more than 50% of the hashpower. 
- "Anyway, this is good news -- the Chinese pools now have only 51% of the hashpower"
- " the Chinese miners themselves could form a cartel and take control of bitcoin for their increased profit."
- "the number one exchange in the world is in China. ... and I wore down my fingers telling that to the folks at bitcointalk, for months on end..."
- "China has shown that governments can in fact ban bitcoin, or restrict its use so that it becomes little more than a gambling instrument."
- "BTC-China is based in Shanghai and traded in CNY, while Bitfinex is based in Hong Kong and traded in USD. The two cities are "special economic zones"; I don't know exactly what that means, but it may be difficult for common folk in the Mainland to trade in those exchanges."
- "My own favorite theory is that the bubble started in Jan/2013 when BTC-China and Bitfinex made bitcoin popular in Shanghai and Hong Kong. My guess is that Mark or some other MtGOX insider decided to profit from the bubble by trading in China with the customers' bitcoins. So the guy created Willy, who would buy bitcoins from other customers at a 10% premium with non-existent dollars, withdraw them and sell them in China. The plan must have been to bring the revenue from those sales out of China, and use part of it to fill the clients' dollar accounts, pocketing the profit."

There's no "correct" hashrate, and the utility of the increased hashrate probably falls off as it increases, but that degree is not really quantifiable.
You've also got how markets work backwards: people don't pay upwards to the cost of things, they pay downwards for their benefit. If something costs too much to match people's perceived benefit, they don't pay. So the tx costs won't rise to meet the miner costs, the miner costs will lower to meet the tx fees people pay (in 20 years)

LBC is a site made to sell Bitcoins, so it's a marketing vehicle directly to find people to buy and sell Bitcoins. They do a lot of the heavy lifting for you of finding trading partners and making trading simplified for people who are new to Bitcoin

We definitely need a game changer, but I'll be the first to say it will take a lot of work to make that happen and I don't want to put in that work :( That's one reason we don't see a lot of decentralized stuff: it takes a lot of work and it's hard to make money off of

Most (over 90%) of the power is directed at claiming the block reward, which is scheduled to go away, so you will get 10x improvement there
Also the block reward is designed to bootstrap a system that will last 100+ years, so you need to add all the cumulative tx of that future system to your calculations

Lightning network is similar to all the other ways to transfer Bitcoin "off chain".
Examples of these ways:
1. trades on Bitcoin exchanges
2. sends on coinbase
3. change tips between people
These off chain systems use a database to keep track of who owes whom what. Lightning is pretty much the same as these other systems, except it uses some smarts built into the blockchain to prevent a negative downside of these centralized systems: they can potentially run off with your money. Also unlike these other systems, it has a protocol for them trading with each other, in a way where they can't cheat each other.
So lightning has nothing to do with high fees or low fees. Lightning is just another bitcoin client, the same way coinbase/changetip/bitstamp interact as just another client.

I guess Bitcoin can't work for any exchange market, it's too slow so we must speed it up and have 10 second blocks. No trader wants to wait up to 3 hours for a confirmation! We should also reduce the min fee to nothing, what if I want to tip someone 1 Satoshi: that's way too expensive with a fee of $0.03. Also we need to switch the proof of work, no ones gonna want to get into mining when it requires an ASIC, and the base unit is way too high: let's do a 1000 to 1 split in preparation for super high Bitcoin prices

That doesn't sound too correct, the miners are going to get an extra 10 bitcoin, so people will sell all their Bitcoin? What if the miners say it's just a one time thing? Some people might leave but not everyone.
Your understanding is flawed because the users would not need to sell their Bitcoin, they could just ignore the +10 bitcoin fork. If the 51% attack you described occurred, it would cost the attacker a lot of money in electricity and the network could just wait it out, or switch to a different proof of work. I also think it's very far fetched that the miners will 51% attack to promote an 8mb blockchain: so it's not even really worth thinking about

In theory Bitcoin is an experiment in anarchy. No one person should be making these decisions, if the theory of Bitcoin holds
However even though people cannot be coerced into doing something by force, they can still be talked into doing something by persuasion, so in the Bitcoin world, persuasion is power. Thus are setup to have persuader kings.
Satoshi has a lot of power to persuade, but anyone could do it in theory.

For proof of work the clues to centralization of miners are in the availability of mining equipment
If mining equipment is available for sale that will get you a reasonable share, it's easy to assume that the others playing the game have the same opportunity and thus the mining is split in a fairly distributed way
Alternating proof of work and proof of stake means you have half of the problem of "wasteful work" still, and only half of the benefit. It's like saying lets have the blockchain operate as normal, but let's give the core devs the ability to make confirmation blocks every other block so that it will be more efficient, we can trust them and they'll only have half of the power

Bitcoin doesn't have a good way to map the costs of storing and syncing data to the fees you pay to do it. That's why it doesn't offer an easy way to store data, and why there's no altcoin out there that forks Bitcoin to offer that service

Yeah but you are talking about property rights in the public company's country right? So if I buy a share of Facebook through this proxy service, and the proxy service goes down and then I try to recover my partial share, no government will enforce my right to that share.
Whereas if you buy shares through a normal legal broker but the broker says "get lost", then you actually have "ownership" over it and the government can enforce that through the legal system.
Also, the only people who can legally buy Facebook shares are going to be doing so in a way where the kind of resale you are talking about is legally prohibited. So those people would have to be breaking the law, and if they get busted, your shares are probably worthless
I think the best option you have in this case is to "bet" on the share price and not "own" the shares, because no one will enforce your ownership

Proof of stake doesn't work as a concept

To be consistent with the rule against altcoins the rules should be: you can discuss hard fork changes to Bitcoin, but only with the underlying assumption that consensus will be with your hard fork 
Discussion of or promotion of a hard fork that probably would not not have consensus should take place only in a dedicated subreddit 
Imagine if ether guys make a fork called Bitcoin ether that used the balances from Bitcoin and said that ether is satoshis true vision. That's as maybe, but it's off topic because it wouldn't be Bitcoin until basically everyone agreed it was

Not only that, someone correct me if I'm wrong but I think the 6 blocks were mined by a miner who isn't even running XT but just offering a marketing exercise to attract hashers who want to make a statement
BIP 100 seems to be the darling of the hashing community, so it seems like 101 will either drop the 71% majority idea or will submit full control of the blocksize to the hashing power as they seem to desire to form a unity opposition to core

I personally don't favor solutions that give miners more power because they are already a large point of centralization, more power makes that situation worse
The other problem is that bandwidth is not the only metric for block size, there is also CPU and Disk. Transactions can only be checked at a certain speed, this takes a while. With 1mb it's not so noticeable, at 10x, 100x it would be.
I had a similar idea to yours, which would be to allow the miners to "purchase" more block space. We could setup a static fee for block size, like 1mb more is 0.1 BTC. Right now there is a backlog of 90mb but there are 17 BTC worth of fees in that backlog. Let's say the miner could increase the block size 100mb for one block, but they would have to pay 10 BTC for that privilege. They could clear out all the backlog in the next block, and still come out 7 BTC ahead. They would "pay" by burning the coins, which makes all the other coins more valuable

Centralized third parties aren't the great satan, they are just a possible tradeoff towards the best solution for the user.

It depends on the sidechain, "sidechain" is more a standard protocol for interacting with the blockchain, what's in the sidechain can be anything.
There can be some assurances: the sidechain will probably use merged mining to provide security, so they'd also need Bitcoin miners to go along or switch to indie miners. You might only want to choose an open source sidechain, with clearly stated goals and designed in a p2p decentralized way. These would add additional security against the situation where the devs decide to 
"get theirs". What stops Bitcoin devs from putting in an update that says, "1% goes to bitcoin devs for operational costs"? Only a social contract and game theory
Also, the fact that sidechain is a very lightweight concept could also be beneficial. In the case of WC3 and DOTA, you say it's tied to an old engine, however a sidechain doesn't need to use the Bitcoin engine at all

You're just terrible at basic math


400 is 100 times 4, not 2 times 4
No one will give 2 shits about the network dropping to 200 PH/s, it was even at that exact level less than 1 year ago.
To continue my analogy, people are killed every day in the favelas of Brazil. It costs the Brazil about $15 billion dollars to put on an event like the World Cup. The murder rate in Rio is about 6,000 men women and children / year. So that means instead of allocating $2.5 million dollars per life saved in the favelas, Brazil hosted a soccer tournament. Only very indirectly does that logic of linking two unrelated numbers make any sense.
It's true that the miners get more money than provided by their marginal utility to the network, but that is neither here nor there, that is how the system was setup and there is no "perfect solution" that was avoided.

Not everybody considers it a problem
People who think it's a problem mainly say that it's representing a security problem where people who are not using a full node are not given the full and total protections against invalid transactions. The fact that people don't seem to want these protections is also a problem, because trust-less transactions is one of the major selling points of the Bitcoin project, so it points to people not valuing full decentralization or there being some problem with full nodes.
There's another set of people who might not be too happy about having fewer nodes, people who use Breadwallet or Multibit, Android Schildbach wallet. These wallets need full nodes to act as servers for them, and for nodes they connect to randomly to be legit nodes.

Bitcoin network is more like the government mint. When visa moves around dollars they are moving around abstractions of dollars, not true dollars (which arguably no longer even exist)
Bitcoin works the same way, there are slow ways of moving on the main network and fast ways of working that are on other networks. 
The Bitcoin network scales by delaying less important traffic. This encourages the least important traffic to always stay off chain on other networks and ensures that traffic is serviced in order of importance
This process is in place today and most Bitcoin traffic is already on 3rd party networks. In fact there's no reason visa couldn't handle Bitcoin on their own system

Miners could be somewhat intelligent about this too, they could give tx in this scenario some leeway that they didn't have time to adjust their fee. But you're not considering the preventative effect of dynamic wallet adjustment. The spammer wants to cause maximum disruption, not just disruption for the unlucky few at the beginning of the attack. So the presence of adaptive fees makes the spam attack much more expensive because they have to carry it on a long time just to get the guys at the beginning (they are no longer stopping the guys after the attack is underway)

What are the alternatives? There have been some other ways of dealing with it already attempted but what are your ideas?

It's not the miners own block that they skip validation on, it's the block before that: another miner's block. Basically they were taking for granted that other miners were producing valid blocks and extending that invalid chain.
The bigger the block coming before you the greater time it takes to download and verify it, the more chance of getting beaten to the block by another miner, so the greater incentive to skip validation.
This has the nasty side effect of making SPV clients much less safe because they depend on miners to be incentivized to always publish correct blocks, they just look at block height: even block height based on invalid blocks. 
In a situation where miners are sometimes posting bad blocks and accepting the orphans trade off, a confirmation in an SPV client will not always match what a full node client sees. 
You could scam an SPV user in the middle of one of these forks by sending them Bitcoin for something during the invalid blocks and they wouldn't know they weren't really sent anything until the valid blocks caught up.
@_date: 2015-08-16 07:36:18
Yes but the small block side could switch the difficulty to be lower
@_date: 2015-08-17 07:16:37
Lightning doesn't promote or prevent blocksize changes
Small blocksizes may not have high fees, people may just stop using the blockchain once the fees become too high and that would put an upper limit on the cost of fees
Lightning may actually reduce use of the blockchain, since tx would be flying back and forth over the lightning network and not touching the blockchain
The exact requirements for running a lightning node are not yet known since a stable lightning version doesn't exist, but it shouldn't be too much different than running a full node, maybe more resource intensive

@_date: 2015-08-20 10:31:11
During the period of the hard fork, the coins will be valid in both, however this means a market will arise where you can trade between. That means the value of the coin will split along the lines of whichever coin is more likely to win. If you trade your coins to the winning side, you will restore all the value of your coins. If you trade to the losing side, you will lose the value of all your coins. If you stay in the middle, you will lose all the value of whatever side of the fork you had coins on that lost
You're right that difficulty will change confirmation times, but people don't transact that frequently and transaction times are often long and it's not unprecedented to take a while longer (see the spam attacks)
Miners moving to a changed fork is unlikely to make the core devs think differently, because that would mean that they were giving more power to miners and stopping miners from having too much power is already a goal

Bitcoin only puts a floor on the number of bitcoins in the money supply, virtual bitcoins can have a real impact on the price and so they are almost the same as real bitcoins. It's similar to how the price of Bitcoin is also a virtual construct by the marginal price, it's not actually the price for all the coins. People can easily demand their bitcoins not be used as the backing for virtual bitcoins and it's dangerous for a company to hold virtual coins, but in the case of mtgox those things happened.

Don't believe in complete anonymity, it's like complete security: impossible.
Cryptocurrency leaves a trail of data, and any trail can potentially be followed. Fingerprinting attacks are basically impossible to stop completely, think of all the factors that are difficult to obscure: how much you are spending, what time of day you are spending, what websites you are using, what language you are using, many factors.
You can improve your anonymity by reducing these factors, but you can never eliminate all of them. Software or human analysis that puts these factors together can always potentially connect you to past actions, even if just on a probabilistic scale.
Also even if you are perfect with your anonymity and catch every factor, an echo of your existence and identity is also present on the people you interact with. For example Facebook has a detailed profile of you based on your friends' data even if you've never signed up for Facebook.
You should do simple and obvious things to improve your privacy, but never think you are 100% private or 100% secure, it's about risk assessment and making it too costly and difficult to make it feasible for the other guy to win in an attack against you. TOR can be used as one of these tools, but it's not a silver bullet: there is no silver bullet.

If you want to go between systems you'd need to use Bitcoin though: it wouldn't work as a general way to scale all transactions, just small clusters of transactions amongst a group. It's similar to the way an intranet works with the Internet: to talk between intranets you use the Internet but inside the intranet you don't touch the Internet. That doesn't mean the Internet is useless or solve all the Internet scaling problems, it potentially makes Internet scaling problems worse

Streamium doesn't pay per second on the blockchain
The Lightning Network intends to use a similar principle to reduce load on the blockchain in a trustless way

It could theoretically reduce "closing costs" - these are the paperwork costs of actually doing the deal. On a million dollar house sale, closing costs could be $25,000
Even though house sales are routine, the mechanics of them are still using non automated / legalistic processes which is the basis for high cost. So you have to pay to get contracts done, pay for time to close, title transfer fees, government processing and deed change fees, title insurance, etc.
Using the blockchain as a record of non bitcoin transactions is controversial but people are already doing it
@_date: 2015-08-20 08:13:58
That's totally wrong
Miners have no power over hard forks. Hard forks mean that the core rules of Bitcoin are changed, like the 21 million cap, the 10 minute confirmation time, etc. The defense against those rules changing is that your client will not accept them changing, even if the change comes from a miner with majority hashing power
Miners do not call the shots. I don't know why you'd even want to use a system in which a group of 10 miners would have power over everything, including the ability to take your coins or print new coins at will

Every restaurant I've ever been to that accepts bitcoin uses a 3rd party system like BitPay that lets merchants accept the bitcoin instantly without waiting for transaction to confirm, just for the transaction to be well known in the bitcoin network.
If you can pretty much trust the person, there isn't a need to wait for confirmations: it's like accepting personal checks except digital.
@_date: 2015-08-15 08:15:11
A lot of the stuff that makes Bitcoin work are outside of the realm of cryptography and algorithms, they lay in game theory and economics: so they can't live up to the high standards of "impossible to break" that have been found in cryptography
Bitcoin is antifragile but it's not impervious to harm, it simply resists harm strongly, with a backup of impenetrable cryptography concepts should the worst happen
Very dedicated large governments could take Bitcoin down for that reason, even if they couldn't break the cryptography components that protect core elements like "you can't spend someone else's money"

That's similar to how it used to work, and at one point a standard Bitcoin transaction cost $0.10 instead of the current $0.03
Bitcoin was updated though to try and reduce this static mapping so that prices will dynamically adapt and be market based
Since transaction supply is a commodity, until the supply is exhausted by demand it's reasonable to expect the price to stay low

The block reward has zero to do with the number of transactions. It's like saying the number of dead children found in favelas every year divided by the number of olympics and world cups sponsored by Brazil every 10 years is how many. There is no relation. More transactions doesn't cause more block reward, less block reward doesn't cause less transactions, these are two completely separate numbers. You know that you're full of shit because you left out your random and inconsistent future price numbers
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:37:38
The blocks are not as important as the actual passage of time. Think of it this way, Bitcoin security is based on "proof of work": mining cycles spent. More work means more security. More time means more total work. If you make the confirmations 5 minutes, they are half as much work, so they are half as useful. There are other problems with too short confirmations as well, but the main one is that it's not the confirmations numbers that are important, it's what they represent

To find a decentralized agreement across the entire world, in a way that can't be gamed with timing attacks, on current networking and CPUs, we need minutes not seconds to get meaningful confirmation data

As far as I know, none of the core developers are arguing for 1mb blocksize cap forever, they're basically saying that a cap lift should be:
1. Made at a time where it would be of immediate benefit (existing fee pressure)
2. Made with total confidence that the large blocks will be safe
3. Made with near 100% consent of the network
4. Made when it would not present significantly more centralized points of weakness

Because the tx is over 1k, you should use a higher fee to compensate: bigger tx will be de-prioritized

Lightning Network is designed with instant confirmations in mind. A lot of commerce right now has to go through BitPay and Coinbase etc to be able to accept zero-confirmation orders, and it's a messy situation even then. With Lightning Network, confirmation waiting is not necessary.
I think Lightning Network fees are an open question. It could even be more expensive, although I think they will try to design it to be less expensive
Anyway the incentive for Lightning is already in place: $0.03 fees are still pretty high for $0.99 purchases, double spend prevention is still annoying, so it might be a factor, but it wouldn't be the defining factor

There's no relationship between miners mining and exchanges exchanging and users transacting. Each of these groups can act however they feel like.
Some exchanges may accept both types of coins, and charge a fee for both, so they will be neutral. Some exchanges will take a stand, one way or the other.
I think also people will rush to taint their coins on one side or another. That will give you a chance to make some more money: trade coins from the side you think will lose for coins from the side you think will win. It will also prevent you from accidentally sending twice to the same person.

Mike was the one to call for a dictator, that's why he's called that, it's what he said he wanted to be called

Electrum servers use a different design for indexing and working with the mempool that use up more resources than normal nodes use, and they're written in a higher level language that is not as optimized. This can all be fixed and should be, but need more development is needed to make it happen. Bigger blocks would also make the problem worse. A more promising direction for this use case you mention is the single relay node for SPV, in theory you could just tunnel to your server with the full node, but the toolchain is the problem here, it's just annoying to make this work right now.
Privacy isn't the only problem either, SPV has a big issue with merchants using it, double spending is much easier against a SPV target because block height is an imperfect indicator of valid transactions. Bigger blocks would also make this problem worse because more mining pools would skip validation and be more prone to publishing invalid tx in their blocks. Software takes time and effort, even the block size increase update which should be very small is not live yet in Bitcoin XT.

All that has to be done is to program wallets to figure out the correct fee based on market conditions
Raising the cap wouldn't stop the disruption because many pools aren't even at the existing cap yet and they probably wouldn't raise it to huge levels by choice anyway for fear of orphaning their 25 btc block to grab a few more pennies in fees
Raising it to 20 would make the same attack 20x more expensive if you ignore that miners wouldn't really publish huge blocks, but even then an attack is still feasible, so that would only be a partial solution
The best solution would be if wallets automatically calculated proper fees, the miners prioritized real tx and hardened against spam, and the devs and community at large found common ground that fees for real world usage should be kept within a certain discrete range through planned consensus adjustments.

It's a network of nodes who connect to each other to exchange Bitcoin payments. To make sure everyone stays honest they use payment channels and time locked guarantees. 
The advantage of this network is that it bundles many transactions into single Bitcoin transactions which reduces the requirements to run a full node and allows individual payments to be confirmed instantly instead of waiting an 30-60 minute for confirmations
It doesn't exist yet though, just a white paper and some early code is all that we have

Some steps to improve privacy
1. Use a full node like Bitcoin core. SPV clients have lesser privacy because they have to ask for specific address balance info, revealing what information you want to the people you are asking
2. Never reuse an address. Address reuse links multiple transactions together, linking is the essence of deanonymizing 
3. Try to safely mix your funds with other people. This helps obscure the chains of transactions
4. If possible, avoid combining funds to pay someone, instead pay in multiple transactions. In other words, if you received 1 Bitcoin and 0.5 Bitcoin in 2 transactions, and you owe 1.5 bitcoins to someone else, see if they'll give you 2 addresses so you can avoid linking the 1 and 0.5
5. Encourage everyone you deal with to practice good privacy. If everyone else who knows about you is leaking data about you, that's hurting your privacy

There is a timetable for 6 month releases, but so far the lead on the project doesn't want to slot this change in
Your reference to the fact that the code can tell you how many coins there will be is pretty apropos: the blocksize limit is in the same category of fixed numbers. You don't actually have a guarantee that in 2 years there will still be 21 million coins, just 21 million coins if you are still using the same or similar client in 2 years. Everyone else could decide there should be 100 million coins and then you'd still live in 21 million coin world but be by yourself. It's unlikely, but possible 
Changing the blocksize in a contentious way could lead to a lot of disruption for the greater network with transactions blocked and funds lost, so some amount of caution is justified to prevent that from happening

I'm not saying stop them, just lower their priority when deciding which transactions to include when there are too many transactions to go in a single block
On chain gambling: that seems like a pretty bad idea to me, maybe it's a good idea for a sidechain. I wouldn't stop it, but I would de-prioritize it. Given an on-chain gambling tx and a person trying to make some purchase from a merchant tx, the purchase should at least be attempted to be prioritized in full block scenarios. Also I think each miner should have their own strategy for de-prioritization so you can always wait for a different pool with different policies 
I don't agree with lukejr's spam lists for relaying because if you install them and you don't know about them, you could possibly get a confusing experience. Spam lists should be opt-in like adblock, not included by default. However you don't need every node relaying every transaction so it's not quite censorship, there just needs to be a path to the miners for them to see it, which doesn't take very many nodes at all

If delayed tx time were truly a way to force a hard fork, miners would control the entire protocol and they could do whatever they want including changing the block reward

Gavin has seemingly gone back and forth on whether or not a block size limit lifting is a robust long term solution or not. He's described his patch as "kicking the can down the road", but he's also described his patch as "eventually able to handle visa-like transaction numbers on regular PCs"
There are three major issues at hand:
1. Does a high block limit hurt the formation of the prophesied fee market that is meant to replace the block reward? The argument goes: it increases the supply of transactions, which should have a depressing effect on the price of said transactions.
2. Does a low block limit hurt the usability of the network by forcing people into side channeled versions of bitcoin, splitting up and weakening the nascent and hard fought merchant ecosystem that exists today?
3. Does a high block limit hurt the decentralized defense of Bitcoin, its ability to resist censorship and control by being split into resilient peer to peer nodes that route around damage by increasing the cost to run a node and therefore potentially the supply of nodes?
The problem with all these questions is that they have no clear answers, answering them requires predicting future things that are based on many complex factors. That makes it seem like the best way to solve this problem is to either go to the farthest extreme and "over solve" by eliminating the block limit variable or "under solve" and try to avoid any change. 
Mike Hearn has rallied for "over solve". This says basically, "let's take the brakes off, if we go too slow we die anyway so let's not worry about that."
Core devs are put in the default position of "under solve" and they are trying to find any way to avoid predicting the future consequences of change, with the idea that "Bitcoin must last the ages, even if the growth part fails"
Since these are irreconcilable viewpoints, there will never be a way to find consensus between them, which suggests two coins. However I imagine that there is a happy middle ground that would capture most sides. The Bitcoin ecosystem is already extremely imperfectly formed, as evidenced by the heretical quips of core devs about how SPV and zero-conf transactions and all the messy hacks that have been formed to make Bitcoin more usable in practice. That makes me think that the purists would give ground, although unhappily. And on the growth side, a pitch of Bitcoin as a "get rich or die trying" concept is not likely to win many true believers if it is laid bare. And true belief is necessary, otherwise it's just an exercise in bag holding

Miners are responsible for resolving conflicts not validating, every full node validates and has no need for a miner to do that for them
Saying someone will be a millionaire reveals the silliness of that statement: dollars will be replaced with Bitcoins and now you will have millions of dollars?
The point of Bitcoin is to grow a community where many people opt in to using it to exchange goods and services with each other, not to create a community big enough that early adopters can jump ship and leave it
What has gone wrong specifically in the finance market and government policy? It's that short term interests have overridden long term interests. It's just so easy to take a loan that is due 10 years later and flip that new money into bonuses, profit upticks, gdp increases and bread and circuses in the short term. But that's creating two problems: it's economically breeding for bad leadership and it's more and more unsustainable as these loans become due and real growth does not follow. Bitcoin alone also cannot solve this problem, it can just be used as one tool by people wanting to solve it.

I've moved around, but also don't forget upload speed which is less important but still relevant
I think one difference between my numbers and the "average" is that the average person goes for cheap bandwidth plan which used to be lower, whereas I always go for the most expensive plan which seems to hover around similar values unless you get a fiber plan in your area.
My theory for this I think is the "last mile" problem, there's only so much data that can be pumped through the legacy last mile pipes. A lot of the improvement for the "low end" came from wiring the hubs better so there was less point to meter traffic at the last mile, but the last mile limit still exists wherever there is no fiber, and that will put a firm limit on each household until the work is done to dig up the ground and fix the infrastructure or other tech is figured out

I don't get the feeling that there's a lot of fractional reserve going on at the moment, maybe MTGox was an outlier but time will tell
I do think that "audits" to ensure that your exact coins are present in the reserve and are not being lent out is going to improve things somewhat, although the institutions have to supply this capability or people have to demand it. I think Kraken and some other exchanges have implemented this? 
One thing that's actually protecting Bitcoin to some degree is that the state of regulations about lending coins is pretty bad: lenders get no protections and might even face legal problems themselves just for lending. Also the price is so volatile that loans enumerated in Bitcoin are dangerous, so that also reduces the potential for fractional reserve too. Neither of those things are likely to change for a long time IMO

No one really knows, but mining will probably trend towards places with cheap power: that will be the major cost of mining once the ASICs reach the point of diminishing efficiency returns.
It's possible for miners to pool without "centralizing" so much, like with p2pool.
The other issue is we'll probably never really know. Mining is pseudoanonymous like everything else in Bitcoin, so there's no way to know for sure how centralized things are unless they volunteer that information or start abusing their position
This doesn't really have anything to do with Bitcoin's popularity though, if anything being more popular could make Bitcoin less centralized.

Multisig is better security if you don't trust one place fully. So if you don't trust your ledger, it's more secure to have a multisig with ledger and something else (not sure if ledger even supports that, but I know trezor does)

I doubt this could work because of complexity, but a system that modeled every cost and benefit and rewarded all accordingly.
Contributing users: medium benefit by posting content that draws views and creates community (up to a marginal gain asymptote). Help reduce spam and trolling by flagging, content quality by voting. Cost by using system resources.
Lurking users: small benefit by providing audience for contributing users, cost system resources
Ad following users: large benefit by increasing compensation from ad providers
Ad providers: large benefit by compensating site with money, cost by reducing site quality
Gold buying users: large benefit by compensating site with money, cost by increased incentive creation demands
Admins and staff: large benefit by keeping site running and content quality, cost money to do work
Spammers: zero benefit, cost in decreased content quality
Mods: large benefit by reducing spam and increasing content quality level. Cost admin time, forum naming usage
Trolls: zero benefit, cost In decreased content quality 
Forums have a little economy that works already, but are often subject to trolls and spammers at certain popularity thresholds. This should maybe be counteracted somehow by introducing a cost to them that either prevents them from introducing a cost or adds a corresponding and counterbalancing benefit. Since mods can stop spammers and trolls, increasing their benefits would also work (as long as it was related to their contribution). Contributing users could also be rewarded for good signal on quality content and have some cost for bad signal.

Would Satoshi be on this asteroid?
Asteroid mining isn't that crazy of an idea, we're getting closer to it being a reality. I think if there was an Apollo type project it could be done within 10 years. The US is already working on regulating it (thanks Lawsky) 
Precious metals could definitely make sense for an asteroid mining mission, the point is that the Earth has some minerals that are rare and valued but these minerals are actually common in space. It would be difficult to identify the asteroid, get a drone out there, get the drone to apply thrust to the asteroid to reposition it in orbit with the earth or the moon, extract chunks from the asteroid and then parachute them down, but as technology improves this will be more and more reasonable.

There's no existential problem, but there are pros and cons
- Potentially a lot more people getting more use out of the blockchain, or existing people getting more use out of it
- Less likely to be forced to go off-chain, maybe changetip could go on-chain: keeps things more simple and lowers counterparty risk.
- It becomes more expensive to operate a full node, so maybe fewer people running full nodes. A full node is pretty important if you're a merchant: so it makes it a more expensive to be a merchant.
- Miners can either spend time verifying previous blocks, or skip it. The bigger the previous blocks are, the more time to verify them, and so the more likely it is they will skip it (they are in a race to publish new blocks so they want to do that as quickly as possible). Miners skipping verification can reduce the security of the network (potentially wasted hash power) and it makes using SPV clients more risky since they depend on miners not skipping verification.
- It becomes easier for someone to "attack" the network by deliberately trying to make it more expensive to run a full node (like a hostile government or a rival coin)
- Since it's more expensive to operate a full node, there are maybe fewer full nodes for SPV clients to connect to, so SPV clients may have to start paying full nodes, so the price of using SPV clients might go up, meaning fewer people using SPV clients

In the beginning just satoshi made bitcoins on his weak home computer- it takes almost no resources to make them
But bitcoins code has an auction system built in where if someone has a stronger computer they can claim the right to make bitcoins
So the expense of making bitcoins is winning the auction for the right to make them, not actually in making them

If you don't touch your coins, they don't transfer to bigger/smaller fork.
When you spend your coins, that is recorded in the blockchain.
When there are two blockchains that don't agree, they ignore each other. If there is a hard fork and you spent in blockchain A but not in blockchain B, and blockchain A is eventually treated as useless, then those spends in blockchain A "never happened". 
If you are just saving and transferring between yourself, it could be difficult to lose coins in any situation, if you are earning money or buying coins from the "wrong chain" then you can lose coins.

The only reason to put Bitcoin prominently as an option is to make a statement of support for Bitcoin. Realistically you should expect that only a tiny percentage of people in the world have and use Bitcoin, far fewer than PayPal / CC / Amazon users.
Wikimedia doesn't care about Bitcoin, they have no interest in the project.
Arguably they should, the other payment systems have proven they have no interest in "free speech" and will stop people from sending money to "controversial" people if the government requests it, even without a conviction. But it's much easier to wait until a problem becomes personal before trying to do anything about it, until then it's just Snowden's issue or Wikileaks' issue or Mega's issue, not Wikipedia's issue.

I never see you post your "sarcasm" about Brazil's failings, just hold it up as a positive example.

Why do you call it risk of inflation? Inflation is the point of fiat, it's not a risk. If you have 20k pounds in the bank even given a low rate of 2% inflation, you are paying 30 pounds a month to inflation. For that amount you could make 30 transactions per day in Bitcoin.
I'd recommend just trying out Bitcoin and seeing what it's about. Then you can decide for yourself if you want it or not. You wouldn't be able to replace your debit card or credit card with it anyway, so I wouldn't think about it that way.
I don't know if you care about this or not, but UK bankers in the financial crisis were abusing the special privileges given to them by the government for their personal profit. Even after the crisis, bankers continually abuse their privilege, for example the Libor rate fixing scandal.

There is no concept of time in the transaction : 
The timeout behavior just means people forgot about it, it doesn't mean it can't ever go through. If someone hangs on to it and the miner wants to include it, he can: even weeks, months or years later
The only thing that can counteract this is if you "double spend", in which case the first in a block will win and the old one will be invalid.

1. How scalable is Bitcoin: extremely scalable, but only for the core purpose of trustless settlement, Bitcoin will always be more expensive than the cheapest forms of trusted settlements. Bitcoin is designed for situations where trust is not possible or too expensive. Bitcoin should get cheaper and cheaper to run though, it doesn't require infinite growth of investment to operate
2. Will Bitcoin require more and more centralization: in theory it should require less and less since it's based on computing cost. The cheaper computing is, the more decentralized it can be. The future is unpredictable though
3. Mining costs match the reward - lower reward equal lower costs. It will not change tx fees

Gavin's larger block size patch put in a voting protocol where if more than 25% of the miners did not want a larger block they could veto the size increase. He didn't have to put this voting thing in, it could be removed.
Only miners can feasibly be counted to vote (by representative hash power) because there is no other mechanism in Bitcoin to provide for voting
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:09:51
Your numbers are totally off. 51% attacks at lower than $2000/block? Where's the justification for that? 13k/sec is what is needed to keep pace with a steady stream of 8mb blocks. It may be that in the endgame of 8gb blocks that 13mb/sec connections are easily available to everyone, but predicting the future is not an exact science. 
You mentioned LN would stop tx from hitting the blockchain. Making the blocks bigger won't stop LN from stopping tx from hitting the blockchain. Therefore mentioning LN is not really pertinent. Also, is the real solution to a fee market trying to destroy and prevent any form of trading Bitcoins that is not on the blockchain? The blockchain cannot be suited for every purpose, it needs complimentary services.
Blocks increasing in size is not a controversial opinion. Most people agree they can increase in size, especially over 20 years. The questions at hand are:
1. Should there be dictatorial leadership from Mike Hearn on the consensus code? (that's one of the stated goals)
2. Should there be a hard fork taken when there is legitimate and wide spread disagreement over the validity of the hard fork?
Arguing about whether or not blocks should be bigger or if the fee market is an open question is just wasting time. Those have obvious answers that are widely accepted by pretty much everyone: yes blocks should be bigger at some point in the future to accommodate legitimate traffic because the tradeoffs will be small and will get smaller. Yes the fee market needs a solution (although there is definitely more than 1 solution that will work and with regard to block size you an argue it both ways)
@_date: 2015-08-20 13:02:19
Now you're bringing in energy consumption, another ridiculous independent variable
So now you have 3 different things that have no relationship: transaction count, energy use, and block reward value. Why not throw some more in there: there are 7 billion people in the world, they are going to make these transactions right? So if blocks cost $6000 to make, that means 1.2 million people per dollar spent. Pretty efficient if you ask me. Hey I can perform math on numbers that are not directly related too!
@_date: 2015-08-06 04:18:27
Yeah I haven't thought through all the details, maybe it won't work
If the price is very low then the miners could just easily buy more space and flood the blocks no matter what. But they'd still be punished somewhat financially for doing that so they'd need some reason for it, beyond just laziness or a tiny advantage. 
I don't see a situation where the price is super low but the legit traffic is still very high, those seem linked
If the price is very high then the miners won't want to make the blocks bigger, however the high price could also correlate with a lot of legit activity, so in that case there is probably going to be enough legit activity to justify a bigger block if things get really crazy back logged.
The problem might be if the price gets so high that the fee to send is totally disconnected from a fee people would ever reasonably pay. So let's say there are 1 million back logged tx and the price is $1 million per coin. In that case the fees to expand the block size would be so prohibitive that no one would ever choose to pay

We need a permanent solution no matter what the resolution is with the block limit. And right now the solution looks suboptimal: it will be off-chain centralized parties like coinbase who will win after blocks are full and fees start to rise

This assumes so much bogus stuff: that you know that the Chinese are running their miners at close to electricity cost, that the miners are mostly Chinese (hashing can happen anywhere and anonymously and pools can be changed instantly), that Chinese people somehow represent some threat to Bitcoin because they are Chinese, that people care more about the petahash amount that goes up and down than the halving of fresh coin supply hitting the market, that miners can take any real action to limit international settlements, that you have any sincere wish to see an improvement in the Bitcoin project.

You're heading into loonie territory now, you are literally saying any store of value or anything that is not a stock is a pyramid scheme. Renting an apartment is not an investment any more than buying food is an investment in your belly. In your Marxist worldview nothing should ever have any speculative value because that is simply a pyramid scheme. If you own your home I hope you sell it immediately because the value is probably based on what others think it will be worth in the future. Better get rid of your insurance too, that's just based on the idea that it will be worth it in the future, and no one can predict that so they are conning you. After all if everyone collects on insurance, how could the insurance company make money?
The Chinese government did no such thing, so just more blatant lies to cover your warped world view. They stopped their own banks (those they own and operate) from working with Bitcoin, but did not ban Bitcoin. Bitcoin e-commerce is not banned in China. That's just a bald faced lie. It's also irrelevant mud slinging that has nothing to do with mining attacks to cover inferred racism. "Oh did you know blacks commit more crimes proportionally? Not a racist just stating facts". If the miners were in Italy: oh those guys are just a bunch of lazy mobsters with a child raping prime minister, trust those Italians to run Bitcoin?
There are more Chinese exchanges than us exchanges and the number one exchange in the world is in China.
No one is in charge of Bitcoin so anyone inducing anyone to invest is acting of their own accord. People who are saying the price will go up are acting of their own accord: that is not the concept or mission of Bitcoin. Everything is out in the open, "scheme" in pyramid scheme has a specific meaning: "secret". You can just redefine words to mean what you want, like of course you're not a vile racist, you're just "concerned" about the 20% of the world population that are the wrong color to be allowed to have too much mining power.

Altcoins aren't really a solution to centralized mining, they may even make it worse because people just build general purpose machines and direct then at multi pools. If any altcoin gets expensive or even if a pattern do, asics can be made for that pattern
The best solutions for mining centralization I've seen are:
1. Making a way for hash contributors to do the verification work, not the pool owner. There's code out there for this, plus p2pool
2. Making a bigger market reaction to centralization. If miners realize they are messing with the price by centralizing, they will be incentivized to voluntarily put more public checks on their power
3. Making mining a business that loses money but is still possible for individuals to do in significant amounts. Volunteerism seems to be very decentralized: I think if you could make money selling Bitcoin wallets that people would centralize around 1 or 2 wallets that were slick even if they had bad fundamentals and gave power to the wallet devs.

Incorrect version of events. Stop trying to spread FUD, you already admitted that is your agenda and that you've never once even used Bitcoin. 
The devs and hackers did not need to do anything to stop the f2pool blocks, all the full nodes refused them. If the f2pool tried to deposit their reward in an exchange it would fail because their blocks were not seen as valid despite their height
So f2pool realized the problem themselves and said, oh we don't like losing tens of thousands of dollars in rewards, lets make valid blocks instead.

Zero fee transactions are not all that unlikely, we have them today. If the amount of block space were huge (say 8 GB) and there were no other obstacles (there are, but just setting them aside for a minute), you could easily imagine that once a day there would be a generous miner who would come along and scoop up all the zero transactions and shove them into the 8GB. That might not break anything too serious but it's not an optimal situation, you might want to have some minimum fee mechanic overall preventing too much unnecessary bloat.
There are two things stopping miners from charging whatever they want:
1. They are incentivized to keep the network valuable by being rewarded with Bitcoin
2. They are in competition with other miners
Transactions are like commodities, like bitcoin itself. How could you stop a cartel of big bitcoin owners from buying up all the bitcoin and then driving up the price? You can't. I don't know if big blocks aren't the answer anyway, as we've seen there are actually two ways to increase the fees: the miners can increase it or some attacker can increase it by buying out the blocks.

Multisig actually has worse privacy characteristics, for example I shop at a store that accepts Bitcoin but they are too naive to switch their address, they just look for the corresponding amount to know if I paid
Well now if you know someone who uses multisig made a purchase at that store, you have some idea of their other purchases since you can just look at the other multisig transfers. (This store doesn't get many Bitcoin using customers)
Gmaxwell is working on some privacy stuff in a sidechain and some improvements to the node code that may have made it into 0.11 I'm not sure, but the big improvement for me for multisig is the new proposal for multisig where the 3 prefix is unnecessary

Probably looks like dust to miners, what client created this transaction?
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:27:47
First: infinitely large blocks are not physically possible.
The thing is that the small fee we've enjoyed is not a great design, it's just a hard set value that is adjusted periodically based on the whims of the dev team. The miners just follow it out of convention, they don't really care because they are looking for the block reward not the fees.
I would agree it is a possible solution to have the devs continue to set the suggested minimum fee and let the miners overrule them. But it's not trolling to say that other solutions should be considered too

Just forcing you to look in the mirror and consider why you really have a problem with Chinese people being involved in Bitcoin. Banning price fixed to Bitcoin values (which no one does anyway) is not the same as banning Bitcoin, so you should say either "yes I was wrong" or "yes I was trying to get away with a lie"
No one is in charge of Bitcoin, those guys are doing it on their own. What kind of deluded fantasy world do you live in, that Bitcoin would have no one writing about it or speaking well of it? The internet allows for anyone to speak their mind, just because a bunch of worthless people are saying some shit doesn't mean that what they say is representative. Of course from a racist viewpoint, the minority few are the same as all, so that's why you think that I guess. Recently in Sao Paolo, Brazilian fans yelled at a soccer player, "Monkey" "Return to the Jungle":  - I guess that means all of Brazil share your predilection for judging the whole based on the few? If it's not true, don't you find your behavior of shouting "bitcoin is a pyramid scheme" pretty much the same thing as someone shouting publicly "jstolfi is a racist"? After all you yourself said that Chinese people can't be trusted to operate mining pools or exchanges. You nodded off the plight of the favelas and the poor and murdered in Brazil (70% black). Those aren't important to you. What's important to you is posting lies on @_date: 2015-08-16 10:33:13
You proposed that big blocks could be countered with a soft fork if there was a decentralization problem
One problem with bigger blocks is that it could possibly increase the centralization of miners by giving bigger miners an advantage over smaller miners.
Miners are the ones who vote on soft forks, so it seems they wouldn't vote themselves out of power
Also you imply that the normal bitcoin users have to go with whatever the majority of the hash power think is correct. In fact they have another option which is to wait for a different majority to arrive, or to switch to a different hashing method, so the users are still in the driving seat in any eventuality.

Until tech catches up, Bitcoin can be used without the nodes synchronizing by using proxy payments. 
For example if you had a credit card that spent Bitcoin balance, the card company could just occasionally settle up with merchants in Bitcoin (this is how cards work today)
But that's not really going to be a problem anyway because there is too much work to do to make Bitcoin usable and recognized in the 3rd world, it's not just a matter of getting them online
In severe situations like, "I'm an Afghani woman and the Taliban prevents me from going to a bank" or "I'm a Chinese dude who wants to buy some Kindle books to read real history and books here are censored", Bitcoin is already ready to power that because people can go to some extra lengths if they have to

1. Most likely there will be a hard fork
2. The definition of hard fork is that there are two separate currencies
3. Trading between the forks is possible since they are both spendable, it's never really happened though
Most probable outcome is that the hard fork will happen but be invisible to everyday users. No one who has purchased coins in the past will lose funds.

I think there has been very slow progress, with some compromise plans mentioned in recent days when before there was absolute rejection. It's certainly spurred an almost endless series of posts and discussion of something that for years was mostly ignored.
It doesn't help that this forum has also been a font of vitriol and personal attacks on the developers themselves or histrionic cries of "leaving bitcoin". That isn't driving the conversation forward. It's just not enough to post "8 mb blocks or else", that really isn't adding anything to the discussion worth considering.
@_date: 2015-08-10 07:17:56
Miners are not the voters in a block size change so whatever they agree with is not very relevant
It's like the difference between a backwards compatible change and a breaking change. Soft forks are backwards compatible, they don't change the set of rules that are called "consensus rules" and for the most part they are not controversial. Talking about soft forks as if they are the same as hard forks is not correct

Doing replace by fee properly could be good, we have a bad use case when someone makes a new transaction and puts a low fee without realizing it. 
This can happen even under non stress test conditions because the definition of low fee is always changing.
The tricky part to this is making it so that the miners can't game successfully against the clients by making them bid more than necessary
I'm glad we have so long to figure this out because fees are such a big hand-wave in the whitepaper

There are two solutions to the problem he's suggesting
1. When the 51% attacker attacks, wait them out. It will cost them money to attack the network, eventually they'll stop if there is no capitulation because they will be spending money and gaining nothing.
2. Change the rules. Instead of switching to their hard fork, switch to another hard fork that makes their equipment advantage useless.
The fact that these solutions exist prevent the problem from actually happening. It's never happened, and it's unlikely to ever happen because it would accomplish very little. 
It's almost like the mutually assured destruction that prevents nuclear war, there's no point to doing it - so even though it could technically be done, the chance is very low.
A 51% attacker can cause transaction delay problems for the network, cause loss of faith in confirmations, but they cannot steal funds out of your wallet or change the rules or do anything against the fundamentals of Bitcoin unless your full node allows them to that by choice.

Bitcoin doesn't need infinite growth, there's no reason for that. Long term the cost of maintaining the network is just the total of the fees people pay to transact which should remain reasonable because there is open competition there
Bitcoin mining requires specialized computers, but the price of those should fall as the technology becomes commoditized: there is no reason for those computers to cost a lot other than that they are specialized. Cheap electricity can be found all around the world, especially "waste electricity" which can be found everywhere

Ethereum makes no sense, it's technology for technology's sake. Notice when anyone talks about it they don't talk in use cases they talk in buzzwords like smart contracts and block chains and decentralized. Bitcoin has a clear use case anyone can understand: it's money.
I'm a programmer, I'd love a decentralized platform: what they are building is not it. It's fairy dust just like Maidsafe. 
The reason this stuff is not working is they are trying to make it sound amazing and make everything from scratch instead of building on stable foundations in baby steps. Maidsafe also raised millions of dollars to do the same thing, also years in development with nothing to show for it. Storj same deal

Housing markets crash all the time and if you speculate on real estate market price you may lose money. Houses also don't create wealth like companies do.
In the case where you must purchase a place to live whether it is rent or buy, and the specific real estate market is not completely divorced from reality for some reason, a house can be a good investment.
Notice I'm not saying Bitcoin is by itself an investment. You should not expect a return on your Bitcoin purchase. Owning Bitcoins has benefits but Bitcoins cannot create new wealth. Bitcoins have situational uses, but they are a commodity-like token not an investment in the sense of the word that you should expect a return. That same logic applies to pretty much all currencies.

One new piece of data that we have is that it takes a few seconds for miners to validate even 1mb of transactions. That creates an incentive for miners to skip validation of transactions so they can publish blocks faster. With bigger blocks, there could be a greater incentive

The main other use of Bitcoin is as a neutral timestamp
One way to accomplish this is to embed a message in a block's small storage space for messages
Imagine you lived in a country with public voting. You could say all people should publish their votes to a giant database that anyone can download. Now how to make sure the database isn't being tampered with? Continually publish a hash of the votes database in blocks, and then you can tell people they can check it for themselves against what they downloaded and make sure their vote is correctly recorded.
Public key signing could also accomplish this but not as clearly because the database operator could produce multiple different signed copies and claim the other was a mistake or out of date. With the blockchain time flows only in one direction so you can't go back and mess with the past like you could with normal signing

Nodes don't determine consensus in any way except:
1. Nodes pass along tx towards miners, and they can censor that
2. People look at node counts to make decisions about what to do with the network at large
To solve 1, there are defenses to make connectivity widespread and it only takes a single path through the network to reach a miner
To solve 2, people sometimes make fake nodes (very easy) to show that the node counts cannot be trusted. People still pay attention to it, so there has been some suggestions to make this information not easily accessible or warn about it being so noisy.
Determining consensus for double spending is really the job of the miners, their job is to take N versions of history and choose 1 canonical version.

The Bitcoin dev response was that they had implemented a superior fix to the one he proposed
The thing about the spammer is that he was dynamically changing what type of spam he was doing to match existing weaknesses, and even to get around attempts to stop him during the attack. If fee priority were changed one way, he'd go another.
The core issue would have remained in any case: there is only a limited amount of room in a block, and there's no one simple rule that determines what tx is spam and what is legit.
The thing about crypto is you have to be careful to consider things for yourself: don't take other people's word for things even if they sound technical. Demand common sense answers and examine multiple viewpoints, even complicated subjects can be distilled into accessible explanations.

Seriously though I think the losses of Bitcoin will asymptotically decrease if the value stabilizes and more advanced software is developed to prevent loss. There's a big profit motive to make that happen
The point of the floor though is that in a crisis where virtual models of currency explode, there is a bottom given by the underpinning token. For a long time in the US history this core underpinning was silver/gold, since then it's been abstracted to an abstract "leverage" factor which has been somewhat broken by unregulated hedge funds who can buy the debt from the regulated banks directly to bypass the leverage factor and the fact that banks are built on leverage from each other in a financial system so complex it's probably impossible for anyone to know how everything works. (that's what led to the financial crisis, which led to Bitcoin).

The problem is how should a miner prioritize the transactions that are of highest self interest to him. If he just takes the highest fees, it works for the most part, yes. However in the case of a tie, something must break it. 
The big difference though is that miners are heavily invested in the mining process and thus the network's overall health and value. A miner should want transactions to flow through the network easily if they are transactions that will help the value of coins overall, and those might not always be the ones with the highest fees (especially if someone is deliberately trying to attack the network). Coin age and amount give a clue to the true value of a transaction to the network and they are harder signals to "fake": you don't just need a lot to pay fees, you need a lot of built up coin reserves to provide age.

The plan was always that there was to be a fee market: that is what takes over for block reward. Otherwise there is zero incentive for miners.
If a block can be infinitely large and fees can be infinitely small, then total fees will be zero and the total reward of a block will be zero.
You are putting up a clear strawman: $5 transaction fee is not the current fee. That's over 100x the current fee. Not only that you are saying that $5 is only accessible by banks and wealthy people. Who is distorting the narrative now?

Why would you use something that doesn't work and costs too much when there is @_date: 2015-07-28 04:25:02
One reason that normal currency is a terrible asset class is inflation: it costs you money to stay in currency so you must exit as soon as possible. By pro fiat people this is seen as desirable: it encourages investment and lending, to some degree (when people aren't buying speculative stuff instead)
Bitcoin is not a "rigged game" in the same way that fiat is: it's got a well defined inflation rate which in theory means there is no certainty you will lose money like there is with fiat
Bitcoin is also seen as a hedge or insurance against the existing system by some people. What if the government starts confiscating assets? Maybe I can find safe haven in Bitcoin? It's easier for governments to take real estate and physical property than Bitcoins.
Some people are also just speculating. They see a way to get rich quick, so in other words they don't know what they're doing

The attack is on course to ensure Bitcoin adds 50gb to the blockchain, (hitting 100gb+) by next year. That means a new vendor has to sync (needs a decent connection) and verify (needs good cpu and disk) a lot of transactions to get started vending.
Increasing to 5mb could potentially make the size problem 5x worse. If that's the goal of the attacker, then he's succeeded 5x
Really the attack should not spur any rushed decisions, that could be the worst consequence if it shows that attacking the network can cause a change in core consensus rules. Imagine if someone rich sneakily bought up all the coins, so they had 70% of the coins, then they held it as a sword of Damocles by pumping and dumping the market hugely to cause huge shifts in price: all the while saying we need to increase the max coin size or change some other consensus rule. Giving into attacks means they work and means Bitcoin as a system is vulnerable to them.

1. There is a way to use an independent "Oracle", someone trusted who can publish small decision making transactions to the blockchain. Transactions can then be structured based on this oracle, or multiple oracles.
2. Is there a timestamp that is pretty much guaranteed to be always online, never altered, very low cost to use, can be accessed by anyone anywhere, with a large toolchain around it?
3. Only the timestamp is important, otherwise digital signatures would suffice. However I think what this is maybe referring to is colored coins, basically using the blockchain to pass around representative tokens in a way that is immune to record keeping bugs or downtime. So two companies could work together and share assets represented by colored coins and neither company would have to trust the others' database of who owns what.

When you buy Bitcoin, you must be matched up with someone who is selling Bitcoin. The reverse is true when you sell Bitcoin. There is always a price difference between the point where someone is waiting to sell and waiting to buy: otherwise they would just buy and sell from each other.

However I wouldn't get too euphoric about the whole situation because there's a risk that Coinbase will no longer convert backpages' coin to fiats
There is a fiat weak link still since backpage can't run everything on Bitcoin. The thing about fiat is the kyc aml stops people from doing business even if they've done nothing wrong because there's no common carrier provisions for fiat transmitters
What backpage should be doing is converting its staff and infrastructure to Bitcoin, that will force someone to bring them to court and prove them guilty, rather than this government pressure without due process business

I think that's a big reason why zero conf doesn't see many real world attacks. Almost no one who deals with any serious amount of money, especially in exchange for another type of liquid money will accept a zero conf transaction
Unless you're the miner and you know exactly when your block will hit, you're taking a big chance of actually buying the thing you were trying to steal. And in the mean time you're buying from this place so they probably have some details about you, like your IP address or your real address etc, so if you try multiple times and succeed: you just stole from someone who knows who you are.
Finally the idea that one of the big miner pools wants to jeopardize the value of their coins in any way for an increased transaction fee is pretty far fetched. These guys have literally millions invested: they aren't gonna care about helping you get free coffee even if goes through the darknet or whatever

The troll toll is the miner fee? That isn't exactly a new invention?
The key issue is, is Bitcoin a low cost payment network? The answer is complicated, it depends what you compare "low cost" against. If you compare it against $45 international wire transfers probably it is. If you compare it against internal database transfers then it is not.
Taking your assumption that Bitcoin will grow and transaction rate will rise, we are in Bitcoin's "cheap" phase lifecycle. In this phase buying Bitcoins is relatively cheap since they are rarely used and sending payments is cheap since not many people send them. As Bitcoin grows, there won't be enough Bitcoin to go around and the price will rise, but there also won't be enough network capacity to go around and the fees will rise. That doesn't mean the network can't route around this: it is already happening. Changetip and coinbase and the exchanges have been routing around Bitcoin's network limitations for years.

The best security is going to be multisig with multiple "you".
So you have one multisig key with a strong phrase (your brain). You have another multisig key that you only keep on a trezor (your possessions). You have another multisig key that can only sign when you verify receipt of a mobile phone number or email address (your public identity).
Combine those as makes sense for you, or with others you trust, in amounts you trust. Like maybe you only want 2 multisig keys for your spending money, but 5 multisig keys for your savings. There are more and more apps out there that make this easy, like copay and electrum etc.
Multisig has a multiplying effect, it's conceivable that your passphrase could be surreptitiously logged, but for you to be keylogged and your telephone to be number to be hijacked and your trezor to be hijacked all at the same time without you noticing?

We don't have the same monetary system today that was used in the middle ages
Here's how I see it working: Bitcoin is predictable because everything about it is public. The more use it gets, the more predictable it becomes.
Predictable things don't have much variance: if people think it will become deflationary they will overbuy so that it is actually inflationary. If people think that it's going to become inflationary they will oversell so that it is actually deflationary. An equilibrium will be found there so that it stays flat.
Right now there is a lot of variance because the market size is small in comparison with other actors. When the total size of the market is larger in comparison with individual buyers and sellers, it will become more predictable and more stable.

Think about it logically, should any non-zero fee transaction go through? If that's true then there would always be a backlog since the difference between zero and not zero is marginally nothing.
What you're saying is factually incorrect: transaction rates are not "severely" limited, they are limited to the limit that is set. Off-chain transactions can go at any rate needed (exchanges are still happily trading). On chain transactions can still be processed in an average of 10 minutes: all that is changed at the moment is that the fee is increased (by a few pennies) to be processed in the 10 minutes time.

Imagine every transaction is a signed check but with a signature that no one knows how to forge
Up until the point you spend, people know you have the money to spend because another person sent a signed check your way. But they don't know what your signature looks like, so even if they could forge a signature, they can't because they don't know what they are forging
When you reuse an address you are falling back on the security against forging, which is weaker than the logical security of never knowing what to forge in the first place (the huge random number that is a private key)

If people overbuy and hold, there will be "inflation" since that is the definition of overbuy: they bought too much in anticipation of deflation that didn't rise to the anticipated level
Basically why you're saying is that if Bitcoin is accepted as currency then it will rise in price forever. You should be able to see that is not possible: there's nothing in the world you can point to and say "that's guaranteed to rise forever"
I think your confusion is over money supply and Bitcoin circulation. The money supply is not just the bits of paper in vaults, it's all the virtual liquid money in computer databases too. In a Bitcoin economy that principle doesn't change: there can be more than 21 million bitcoins in the money supply. A limited token does not mean guaranteed to go up forever

You're always buying some credits. Credits are also a form of money. People can use Bitcoin to buy "credits", like they buy balances on Bitcoin Exchanges etc. This must always be the case for any kind of transaction you want to go quickly, because of the slow confirmation time.

The only negatives I can see for LBC is that
1. They didn't communicate this clearly even though it's kind of common sense: they need to make this clear
2. LBC is building a monolithic business where they decide who trades. That's not very anti fragile, and the proof is in them getting kicked out of Germany and New York 
The good side of commission is that 
1. Faking volume requires burning money
2. They get incentives to help traders get more
3. Provides an incentive for a real decentralized service to take over eventually when someone gets around to making it

It's not a huge surprise, one of the companies guys runs the XT subreddit and another submitted a plan to allow miners to set any block limit they prefer, they've been pushing for big blocks as regular participating members of the community, this just puts it on paper. Blockchaininfo runs on bitcoinj which is a mike Hearn project
The really dangerous thing about BIP 101 is not the block size. Bitcoin is like a security onion, if you peel off layers there are still more protecting the core. That's why altcoins that have made truly idiotic choices have still been able to survive: the bones of the design are very sound
The dangerous part of the BIP 101 push is the idea of potentially fracturing the network and installing Mike Hearn and/or a succession of shot callers to re-fracture the network anytime a dispute comes up, instead of trying to first slowly build broad consensus and then pull the trigger after it's already a foregone conclusion and the bitter holdouts can be discounted. Gavin did the correct thing by kowtowing to the Chinese and pulling his plan down to 8mb-8gb, and by writing and testing a discrete proposal, and by soliciting support for his plan publicly and privately with all the major players. Where he went wrong is in kicking off a game of chicken where there is a good chance that neither side will blink.

The deflationary spiral is just an economic theory, it's not a practical problem that you can see in everyday economies, inflationary problems are far more common because governments can creation inflation much more easily and readily than they can create deflation.
There are millions of variables that go into an economy and deflation when defined as "prices getting cheaper" can also be caused by thousands of reasons completely unrelated to the currency unit they are enumerated with. There's no conclusive proof for the deflationary spiral, and if you really think about it, how likely is it that currency unit will be the dominant factor in any long term economic downturn (aside from runaway hyperinflation)?
People buying more Bitcoin doesn't change the price of things, it just changes the price of Bitcoin. If people did price things in Bitcoin and the price went up, the price would be marked down in the unit price of Bitcoin, but it would still stay the same relative price where it was before to other things. So did the price really go down? Just the unit changed, but the value it's purchased for is unchanged. Nothing really changed: goods and services aren't priced relative to the currency unit, they're priced relative to their intangible real value / cost.

I think this is a harder challenge than you realize because of the bootstrapping networking value problem and the issue people have for paying for stuff when a free option exists
Just try making a private subreddit that people must pay to access, and then take out all the money that people paid and split it fairly amongst all who contributed every week. It would be really really hard to get people to join in

Most investments are typically characterized by dividends paid to earlier investments by later investors. If you invest in real estate hoping for a return, you are hoping someone later comes along and buys it at a higher price.
The thing that makes a Ponzi scheme a Ponzi scheme is the marketing and substance of the scheme. In a Ponzi scheme the new investments are used to pay dividends back to old investors immediately, but the Ponzi schemer typically lies and says the principle remains and the dividends are expansions from an external source. With Madoff's Ponzi he said he had a way to work the market to generate returns using client funds, he didn't say he was robbing Peter to pay Paul.
What really characterizes a Ponzi then is the lying. Pretty much a good signal of a Ponzi is "guaranteed returns".
Bitcoin can be seen somewhat as a Ponzi from the perspective of people listening to people who misrepresent the truth and say Bitcoin offers guaranteed returns. Ponzi more broadly refers to any investment scam at all, so if people marketing Bitcoin as guaranteed returns who intend to sell at a higher price on the backs of the people who they are marketing to, that's a scam: pump and dump.

Companies generate wealth but land does not. Land is a commodity, we can build taller buildings, farm more efficiently, transport more efficiently, grow in the sea. You can use land to generate wealth but it does nothing by itself. 
Oil is the same way, you can use oil to power machines that generate wealth, there is only a limited amount of oil, but oil does not create wealth
Companies and even countries can go bankrupt and wipe ownership clean though. 
If you own only only land and stock you expose yourself to the risk that land becomes less valuable or companies go bust. Diversification of assets can lead to better wealth preservation. If there's a chance that Bitcoin will retain niche use in the future, it can help cover risk of other assets losing their use. Will there always be a need for Internet currency for some uses? Will it be Bitcoin? Those are the relevant questions.

You can see the problem of micropayments support right before your eyes. Each payment imposes a non zero cost to the network, so there must be a limit to them to prevent a free rider problem 
As the cost of payments lowers, this problem will decrease, but it will always be present in some form due to physics
As a workaround there are two alternative solutions: Bitcoin payment channels that fold together multiple micropayments into single transactions, and offchain services like changetip that do the same thing but in a more centralized way

I guess China, a country with 20% of the worlds population and a territory the size of the U.S. doesn't count? You can't own property there. And the government starts property taxing more than the value of your produce? Guess you're screwed. Farmland is a gamble just like anything else. And it's not the land producing the value, it's you working it that is. But let's say you are producing more value than you can use at the moment: where do you place that wealth? Just make your farmland bigger and bigger I suppose? Meaning potentially larger and larger tax obligations in a property tax scenario?
Let's say in a year you grow $100k worth of crops by yourself. In the same year I take gold, silver, copper and Bitcoin and use them as collateral for a loan to start a business that earns 1 million dollars.

Bitcoin is a software project, the devs are people who are writing code for the project.
Many people have contributed and anyone can make a version of the project, however there are only a small number who have contributed and are contributing "the most" to the most popular version.
Because these small number of people are improving Bitcoin in various ways, most people are downloading their improvements and running them. Some people want them to make some changes that they are not sure they want to make yet.
The people who want them to make some changes then have only two options: don't use the Bitcoin software that the devs are making (use nothing or use some other bitcoin software), or try more to convince the devs to change their minds.

I think you've come unstuck from reality. Here's a reality check: The stock market represents companies / the economy.
In generally, it's fair to say over long periods of time countries with reasonable governments and economies will grow their economies.
That does not mean that every government will stay reasonable, that people won't abuse loans to overbuy markets massively overvaluing even the index, that growth will stay positive in every 10 year period, that mismanaged indexes won't create a correct balance of funds.
When you say "guaranteed" that is another way to say, "I can predict the future". That's not possible, so you are lying.
When you say that I am saying the stock market and index funds is not a valid way to invest and the most probable way to get returns, you are lying, that's what I said from the start.

There's no guarantee of returns, really you'd be speculating
You'll pay the same taxes no matter what you put it in, although with bitcoins you can choose when you realize losses by selling and buying back instantly, which is an advantage over some other investments that are exempted from that tactic by tax law
I wouldn't put any significant savings in a regular savings account, at best you'll get 1% which is arguably below inflation so you'll be losing money on that deal

A mistake is possible if the person sending to you is relaying a received transaction from someone malicious and they are also using SPV. Of course if that person sending to you is not malicious they will maybe resend the previous send since they never sent it.
A mistake is much more unlikely due to the confluence of factors involved. 
Only full nodes are designed to be 100% secure against an incoming transaction going away due to a double spend attack.
The bad blocks are unpredictable and hard to take advantage of for a double spend attack because they only happen 5% of the time. Those bad blocks forfeit their reward so the problem should self correct quickly as the miners are forced to upgrade their software to continue claiming their reward

I'm going back to a full node too. Electrum devs have indicated they will do nothing to protect wallets against fork issues, so the only way to be sure to be using the correct network will become running a full node :(

Starting mining now is like starting an animation studio render farm, you need a big capital commitment, it's not just something you can buy off the shelf

Sounds like you are going to teach the what but not the why
- game theory / international relations: how can independent actors with no central authority work together without screwing each other over all the time? (The prisoners dilemma)
- political philosophy: where do rights come from, what is the proper function of government? (Hobbes, Locke etc)
- Econ 101: what is value, what are the mechanisms through which government influences inflation and what is its relation to the lending rates, what is the difference between a commodity and a stock and a loan
- history: the new deal restrictions on banks and the subsequent rollbacks over time. The hyper inflation of Germany, Brazil, Zimbabwe and the first silver backed paper money issued by the Chinese emperor

Your fee is $0.0008 which is not a high enough fee to receive priority service.
The network cannot handle unlimited number of transactions so it will prioritize based on fee amount, there are enough current transactions with higher fees in the queue that it's unlikely your transaction will ever go through.
Are you using version 0.12 of Bitcoin Core? That fee should not have been recommended.

Thousands of network nodes from the same individual is also known as a Sybil attack, SPV clients and other nodes connect to multiple random nodes in order to not allow one individual to control their incoming information, but if thousands of nodes are run by an individual, this can defeat that safety measure.

1. Jeff Garzik proposed it and the miners loved it (why wouldn't they love things that remove all limits on them and make miner centralization firmly entrenched)

Meanwhile Jeff Garzik has gone off to work on trying to make money reducing the privacy of Bitcoiners and selling people on why they shouldn't use the Blockchain. Remember this is the guy who tried to ban localbitcoins developer for operating in Venezuela

Imagine if Goldman Sachs were presenting Classic, saying Bitcoin was too important to stay in the hands of the cypherpunk coders anymore, who put too high a priority on decentralization at the cost of practical consumer and industry priorities. Would it really matter if they only made minimal changes in their version? Bitcoin is just a financial industry tool or is it a p2p effort to reclaim financial freedom as Satoshi originally pitched Bitcoin?
Now think what is being said: Core is overly concerned with decentralization in their demand that full nodes stay cheap and mining does not acquire too many economies of scale. And think who is presenting this argument: Coinbase, founded by someone whose previous employer was? Goldman Sachs. And who is leading developer efforts? Gavin, who is paid by Coinbase. Does Coinbase really care about your financial freedom? They've never contributed developers to Core development. They've never even made any software for their users that doesn't depend on handing over your money to them, like a bank. 
Businesses like miners, exchanges, merchants: they have no incentive to protect decentralization. If people don't act to protect decentralization themselves and treat it as an essential, valuable part of the network, no one else will and it will be lost

Yeah but even if it shouldn't be part of the consensus rules, changing that one thing doesn't mean the whole way the software is developed should switch to Steve Jobs style leadership.
I agree I don't think removing the block cap will alter the monetary properties. But all sorts of changes to consensus could be rationalized at still keeping the monetary properties. Currently miners are making almost a million bucks a day. Do we the users need that much security? Why not hard fork so they make about $400k/day?

You're trying so hard to concern troll. F2Pool didn't need anyone telling them anything, and the network moved on without intervention. F2Pool stopped mining useless blocks of their own accord, because there was no point or profit to it.

If you suspect there is a chance? There's a chance when you buy literally anything the goods are stolen. That's a ridiculous standard. It's only if you actually have any real actual knowledge or evidence that there is a crime that an ethical boundary is crossed: mere knowledge of the potential is not enough. Also it's dubious if purse would benefit from this crime because of the problems it can present to purse customers and the restitutions that they have guaranteed.

Saying someone is "Taking part in a crime" implies you are also a criminal, and therefore should be imprisoned. "Receiving stolen property" has a specific legal definition that is a real crime. The proof of that crime is that the person receiving the stolen property actually knew the property was stolen and still went ahead and bought it.

I'm saying that the channel won't necessarily close. You can exit out of your Lightning position either to yourself via the Blockchain or to another person with an open channel. So if you exit into fiat, you could be exiting via another person who gives you fiat and takes your LN coins.


I think yes, under ideal circumstances the locks would last a long time. These are just disaster scenario backups, they do not need to truly be used.


People will just receive an LN payment and re-spend it on their expenses. As long as you remain "in-network", there is no problem. Leaving the network is fine too, but it's less efficient overall and more costly to you


LN channels don't have to be closed to receive money, you can re-spend within the network. From your perspective, it's just trading back and forth between your channel locks.


A LN transaction can be considered "settled" instantly, it's not like it will be rolled back. It's an instant confirmation, and you can re-spend it instantly to others in the same way

My theory is that if you follow the money, scams don't have a lot of natural enemies.
Bitcoin probably has some lobbyist presence working against it who are pestering FinCEN and the SEC to "make the rules fair" and demanding pressure on Coinbase and Circle. 
On the other side there are people in government and in the regulatory agencies who see the hundreds of millions being invested in Bitcoin and think about how they can make that part of their career. Look at how blatantly Lawsky made a fuss in NY about adding regulation that all Bitcoin companies must follow, then after it was passed conveniently quit his government job and started a new high price consultancy for Bitcoin companies to hire to help them follow the regulation.
There's not as much incentive for law enforcement to protect people from fraud. Online gambling gets shut down fast because real world casinos lobby against it.

- Full nodes are not supposed to be servers for SPV clients, there is no incentive model for that
- More powerful relay nodes can still exist, only a small fraction of nodes are needed to be powerful to fulfill the full relay role. For example in the next release, a default node will no longer have all the transactions, they will evict some, only powerful nodes will have all of them.
- Miners have a great incentive model to help the node network, they get paid a million bucks a day, plus more transactions reaching them means more fees they get paid
- Full nodes that don't act as super relays still fully validate, meaning the system is still decentralized: the unconfirmed transactions are not very meaningful until they are in a block

So you will be decentralized and requesting from many peers, but also connecting directly to the other miners and asking them directly? Isn't that a contradiction in terms? Basically the meaning here is that oh yes XTB can just drop its claims of decentralization and be a relay network too. Because we are talking about software and not magic beans, if one client can do something, the other can do it too.
You can't rely on XTB either, at any time the miners can stop participating in it. The miners could run the relay network themselves if they wanted to, or participate in multiple redundant relay networks, or the relay network could be built into a version of Bitcoin Core.

What I'm saying is precisely that it is not a conspiracy theory. It's out in the open facts.
These people are out in the open, they are openly banks, both for fiat and Bitcoin, and they are openly criticizing the original developers of Bitcoin of not changing their long term views and design of decentralization to one that would fit their business model.


Decentralized right now means that you can run a full node yourself without a middleman, without a server in a data center, and without being open to manipulation by miners. There are many people (I hesitate to call them Bitcoiners) who feel that decentralized means servers in data centers and economic safeguards instead of cryptographic ones


You are not behind Classic, so you are essentially the moral equivalent of a Buttcoiner, trying to tell other people how Bitcoin sucks and they shouldn't have it. What I am saying is that users must value and fight for decentralization themselves if they want it and they want to keep it, the miners, exchanges and the merchants are not going to fight for it.

Blockstream has 8 out of 45 developers on the payroll and 1 out of 5 committers
The point of a sidechain is to do a 1:1 value peg with Bitcoin. There is no other point to it, other than to make sure that the value of a coin in the sidechain is always the same as the value of a Bitcoin. It's like an altcoin that does not print any new coins, it only uses Bitcoins.


Sidechains are open source, but Blockstream created a productized version of a sidechain to improve Bitcoin market liquidity. It might not be their only product


Liquid has various quotes from various exchanges: 


Sidechains can have lower counter-party risk than ripple. They can be open source and have no "lock-in". They work via smart contracts with the blockchain, which means that they can require less trust and use the security of the blockchain


Core Devs are spread around the world and only 15% of them are in the Blockstream office. One of them would probably say something. Also every proposed change Core has made has deliberately tried to avoid forcing any change on anyone, they want people to opt-in. As long as we always have to "opt-in" to changes it will be hard to force anything since you have to read about it and download it and install it. 


Blockstream has only limited power, because all their software is out in the open. For example China can look at Linux and see all the source code and verify that there are no back doors or problems in it. That's the point of open source.


The check and balance on the power of a developer to suggest a change is: opt-in. Any change must be opt-in, and all changes must be discussed in visible ways


Lightning is not a side-chain, and side chains don't necessarily offer instant confirmation. Lightning isn't even a Blockstream project, it's an independent project that is run by an independent open source team. Blockstream contributes one developer, Rusty, who is a long time open source advocate, a former "top deputy" to Linus Torvalds who created "iptables" for Linux, and the goal of the project is to improve scalability of Bitcoin which should be good for all Bitcoin companies including Blockstream
Confidential transactions are potentially a feature that could be added to the main Bitcoin blockchain, after SegWit. There's already a pull request for it, however it has been implemented on a side chain to improve it and make sure that it is fully ready for deployment before adding it to the blockchain.

Core's concept for weak blocks is focused on upgrading the nodes directly (like thin blocks does), so it would be as decentralized as the network. It probably wouldn't replace the Relay Network unless miners saw very little difference between the two and no one wanted to maintain the relay network.


Currently the p2p network is the failure mode, but setting up a new RN probably wouldn't take too much time. Also blocks aren't currently so big they would take terribly long over the p2p network
I think the biggest worry is that miners themselves will stop cooperating. That would stop thin blocks and the relay network. They might stop cooperating because they would see a way to make more money for themselves. Miners have an incentive to send their blocks around quickly, but not too quickly: they make more money if there is a minority of other miners who do not see their block

His proposal (just increase the block size and use IBLT) has some key problems:
- No developers signed up to code on that plan
- Only uses a vague hope that hardware and networking get better very quickly every year
- Takes over 10 years to work
Doesn't sound like very well laid out proposal to me. Not only did no developers sign up, none of the active developers even think it's a viable plan
@_date: 2016-02-27 05:19:48
Precisely, this idea originated with that it would be a requirement for larger blocks (no justification was given). However since it's slower than the relay network, the best it can offer is a smoothing of bandwidth use for validating full nodes, and a reduction in total bandwidth of less than block size * 144 / day. Or a slower but possibly more decentralized backup in case the relay network dies for some reason.
It's kind of a magic trick, you can tell by the theatrical naming, "look at the thinblocks, they are extreme and radical to the max guys!" Oh but do they actually fix any major problems with larger blocks or are they at best a 2x bandwidth improvement for validating nodes? "Please read the small print: no."
Not all Classic supporters are completely devoid of moral character, for example has made some efforts to try and quench the flames of irrationality here:


"Likely to be slower" is Classic speak for "they are 3 times the size of relay blocks and they have to go through many high latency hops to reach their destination, instead of just directly with no validating on the relay network so there is almost certainly no way they wont' be slower".

4-6 weeks is too optimistic.
They are being extremely cautious and thorough with SegWit - it's been running on a test network for 2 months, and they are helping developers to integrate and test it, but I would still not expect it until the summer of this year, maybe [8-16 weeks given the roadmap and rollout times](
Hopefully during this time wallet developers can take advantage of the time it takes Core to test SegWit to integrate support for it. Every wallet that wants to take advantage of it will either need to have their language's Bitcoin library updated and include that, or they will have to implement support for it themselves.

Bitcoin works by including transactions in blocks, which are persisted in the blockchain. If a transaction is not included in a block in the blockchain, it is not persisted by the network, it is mostly forgotten. Funds can only be considered to have moved when they are buried by miners underneath many blocks (confirmations) in the block chain.
Until transactions are in blocks, they live in a limbo known as mempool, which is the collective short term memory of the system about transactions that people have submitted to the network to be included in blocks
The collective memory generally forgets about transactions that have been hanging around for too long, so as not to waste time on transactions that seem like they'll never be included
So you will probably be able to try again in 48 hours (use a proper fee) and the collective mempool won't remember your previous transaction and so they won't reject or ignore it, like they would mostly do if you tried right now.

The fee market as a whole is needed to represent the cost of usage to the distributed network. This model was created by Satoshi in the early days of the project. In his first system the price was actually exponentially increasing, what we have today is a lot cheaper and more equatable
Imagine if someone decided to store lady gaga videos on the blockchain. This would be an annoying and costly burden on the network, that served little purpose. The fee market priorities that usage down by deciding priority based on who will pay the most per byte

@_date: 2016-02-05 15:39:53
I think of there being two ways to approach scalability. 
The first way is to create a monolith, to make a super beefed up, super fast computer that can handle what you throw at it. 
This is often the simple and easy way to scale, however it has drawbacks: after a while you can't really buy a beefier computer and super top end computers are expensive.
The second way is to shard into pieces, many computers separated out and responsible for a fraction of the overall task.
This is usually the harder and more complicated way to scale, since projects generally don't start out this way and separating into parts makes coordination between the parts a new component. The benefit of this method is that you can always buy more computers, and a failure in one shard doesn't necessarily bring everything down
I see Lightning as more of a sharding system for Bitcoin. Each client keeps his own state (the transactions) and nodes process and relay only their own neighborhood of transactions, not the entire networks'. This puts a firm limit on the computing resources required for an individual node.
I'm not a believer that Lightning will necessarily win the scaling competition, but whatever does win will have to transform this problem into a sharding one like Lightning does. 
Any ideas where individual nodes can just have ever increasing workloads is not going to be able to compete with sharding ideas where the network becomes more diverse and demand on nodes remains constant. You could write a great search engine that ran on one super machine, but when you put it against Googles 1 million machines, no amount of upgrades to your server could match their combined power

That's my whole argument, why are you guys are blowing your load now? 
Why did Gavin say raising the size was urgent in May 2015, we're only two months away from a year off that statement and next block fees are still $0.05? Just cruise on over to your favorite block explorer, you will see there are plenty $0.01-$0.02 fee transactions going through. This is not an urgent situation
Why not just wait until the fees actually do go up before starting all this shit? You'd have a stronger position, now when the fees do go up, people will be in more hardened positions to fight against an irresponsible block size raising response

Classic is actually encouraging this behavior of temporarily buying votes with no intention of actually committing to keeping up after a hard fork.

Since they don't care about how things work, they never even thought that this was an issue

When people really love each other and they all feel the same way about Bitcoin then they say lets fork and everyone gets out of their old Bitcoin clients and into new Bitcoin clients and a beautiful new creation is produced out of this love
However sometimes there is what is called a non consensual forking which is where some people really want to fork but others just aren't ready yet and the people who really want to fork can't respect that and they try to say oh just a little bit at first it won't hurt, hey let's do it cmon, they can get very insistent and even try to go through with it, which is a horrible and immoral act
Depending on the fork you can lose your coins on one side of the fork, but that's an unlikely scenario and is even more frowned upon than unconsentual forking

Can you link me where he is asked?
Gavin says, "with Satoshis blessing" meaning he asked to do it. In the context here (read Gavin's previous postings), Gavin has been already taking this role on, informally. He asks Satoshi in private if he can do it formally and then says Satoshi agrees. That's how I read this
@_date: 2016-02-15 07:27:00
Gavin's had this view for a long time, even against Satoshi on the subject:
[I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea.  So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network.](
The thing is, Gavin has yet to actually publish or contribute to a second client that is actually compatible with the protocol, and he himself pushed and helped create the single team concept that is Core. He talks about creating open standards, but he doesn't ever create them, instead he creates alternatives. He talks about Netscape vs Internet explorer, but what he is doing is more similar to ActiveX vs Flash, two very incompatible and separate systems, with no working group or standards body to coordinate.

Compromise is something we've been doing up until this point. Gavin and Mike always held a vision of Bitcoin that is fundamentally incompatible in the long term with the vision of Core
I'm not sure if they realize it yet, but there are some clever and stealthy plans in the works that will defeat them completely and help prevent any future attack of this nature
@_date: 2016-02-01 10:21:28
Sounds very plausible although I doubt Satoshi will return.
A lot of people have asked what is the danger in a hard fork? Classic supporters have tried to say, "There is no possible danger". "What does this danger mean?" "3 weeks is enough warning for people to switch their node"
But this post lays out the dangers clearly:
1. The price will tank as people turn to fiat to wait out the storm (it's not likely to rocket ship up after in even the most ideal case, so the best risk scenario might be to wait out the whole mess in fiat)
2. Security can drop, opening up the possibilities for double spend attack. Miners often don't update all their nodes for soft forks that aren't even controversial, leaving some nodes still mining the old side, making old side blocks.
3. Core will need to stop developing real improvements to Bitcoin to decide how to respond to a miner betrayal. We will lose development time on real improvements that are desperately needed, like a fix to malleability.
4. It will degrade the trust severely in the entire system going from a model where only users can change the rules of Bitcoin to a model where miners + fiat exchanges can change the rules of Bitcoin. It's much easier to convince 10-20 companies to opt-in to a plan than to convince the vast majority of full nodes operators.
5. Many SPV clients will stop working, because they won't find enough Classic nodes to connect to. This will mean that won't be able to see the new Classic transactions.
6. Core will move forward on PoW change, increasing the risk profile for all companies that are investing in improving our current PoW. Future companies will have a harder time raising investment on that adjusted risk analysis.
The good news is that after such a calamity we would possibly come out severely weakened but with the experience to look back on. It could be either a cleansing fire that would wash away those who would cavalierly and coercively try to push hard forks in the future, or it could simply retard the growth of Bitcoin so severely that Bitcoin would never recover and an altcoin would take its place.

It could work like the fiat conversion system in wallets: use more or less trusted sources. To be safe, put a sanity check range on the fees?
There could even be some kind of signaling mechanism and not a direct fee override: like a 1-10 network saturation alert level. Saturation level 1 = $0.03, level 10 = $0.30
I think bitcoin-core has an estimate saturation command line tool in there somewhere?
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:27:34
One of the big arguments for bigger blocks is that regular people can just use SPV. If SPV is actually less reliable with bigger blocks, that weakens that particular argument for bigger blocks because now switching to SPV is lowering your security lower than it was previously 
Maybe you could make the case though that SPV should be made less reliable because full nodes need more incentive to run, especially when bigger blocks make it more convenient to switch to SPV :D

One characteristic that should be preserved is Bitcoin being "trustless, no middlemen". Since the transaction quantity is directly related to that, it is part of Bitcoin's core characteristics. (imagine 1 trillion transactions forcing you to use a super computer middleman) 


The economic reason behind having decentralization (trustless, no middlemen) in Bitcoin is that in order for Bitcoin to be expensive and valuable, it needs to retain its quality of being resistant to destruction or corruption, so that people can trust that it will stick around and not get shut down or lose its unique properties. Imagine if hundreds of millions of people all around the world ran the Bitcoin network, or if 10-20 big companies in wealthy countries ran the bitcoin network. Which would be more resistant to being shut down or corrupted?


It's not just a waste, given the largest scales at the moment it's nonsensical. Imagine every day that a billion people make two transactions. It would be a big job for a big company to handle that much traffic on their servers. Now think that to be decentralized you need many companies to do the same exact thing in a redundant way without trusting the other guy at all. You're not going to get many companies doing it, and the coin will be easy to regulate or be a middleman for, and then the entire point of the project is ruined. 
Maybe someday in the future we can do what we are doing now, which is coasting on the luxury of our super fast computers and networks. But we don't know if or when that future will arrive, and even when it does, being better will always be important: maybe we will want to have our artificial intelligences use the network, requiring a hundred times as much capacity? Since we can't know, we can't take a precise future for granted.

I don't think they are "fake" in that they aren't fully validating nodes (not that that is hard to fake), I think that they are "fake" in that there is clearly no switching going on. The number of Core nodes has remained pretty stable, the other nodes are additions to the previous total.
The meaning of this is that these nodes aren't actually nodes that have been in real use by real users for real things, these nodes are nodes to "support the cause" and "have a vote", which is fairly meaningless because node count is not a vote or an election for anything, as much as Brian Armstrong might say it is, he is not supported by the facts and the code. 
Node count doesn't even matter for double spending consensus, it's 1 CPU 1 Vote, not 1 free AWS micro instance 1 vote

It messes up peer to peer trading a bit and it messes with privacy for poor people. The only way to achieve privacy ATM is to run a full node, so imagine you are poor and living in a repressive society. You don't want to be using SPV that will reveal to your evil government what your funds look like (they man in the middle you)
It's true that the main point of running a full node is to prevent a customer from double spending against you, however imagine an independent contractor and a lazy business. The lazy business accepts double spends as a cost of doing business and doesn't bother to run a full node. They then spend a double spend against you the contractor.

They are the only ones who want to change Bitcoin in a way that wouldn't require an opt in from everyone who wanted that change. It's important that Bitcoin always lets you opt in to any future change, then even if someone does make a version you don't like you can just not use it.

Why would you have to close your channel to exit Bitcoin or trade on an exchange? Someone on the other side will still need to get those coins (ever seller must have a buyer) and in this scenario you will just transfer to them.


For estimation simplicity to find the most extreme case - let's say that each active LN user requires at least 2 channel openings and closing every 8 months to 14 months. And that 3000 channels changes can fit on a single block. So 3000 changes / 2 channels * 144 blocks in a day * 2 capacity in SegWit * 30 days in a month * 8 months = 100 million - or 14 months 180 million
In the generous term case where we have generous 6 channels open, locks every two weeks, blocks with only room for 3000 channel changes: we can support a million active users in that scenario - 3000 changes / 6 channels * 144 blocks in a day * 7 days in a week * 2 weeks = 1 million

RBF either way doesn't stop payment channel apps.
There are two possibilities for enabling Full RBF:
1. It encourages everyone to use more sophisticated security measures because it's now much more accessible to double spend
2. People just drop using Bitcoin altogether because they didn't spend time to enable sophisticated security measure and relied on a naive implementation

SegWit is pretty broadly accepted as a good thing, it's basically some important bug fixes for Bitcoin. It should be feature complete within the new few weeks and roll out to the network within the next six months.
SegWit will offer new transaction types that are much smaller than existing ones in terms of block space, so about twice as many will fit in a block. Clients will have to opt-in to this behavior though, they will need to update if they want to use it
Lightning Network should make microtransactions and instant confirmations possible in a decentralized way, while improving privacy and offering rewards for running nodes. It works by creating a network of payers who all cooperate to send payment promises that are occasionally settled to the Blockchain which guarantees its security. 
Lightning is more controversial, the founder of Classic calls Lightning an altcoin and says it will steal the fees from miners and it's dangerous: he suggests people could lose their money if they use it. Gavin Andresen who is the driving force behind the schism, says that Lightning is centralizing and the wrong solution. His solution is to use Moore's law to over time have better and better computers be better and better at running things without changing much code

If you have a secure environment, [Bitcoin Core version 0.12]( has made huge improvements and can serve as a personal wallet. From a security perspective it is very well vetted, and it focuses on trusting/requiring no other server or service, and keeping all of your transactions private. It will use TOR automatically if you have it running.
In previous versions, I would not have recommended it, but they have made some huge improvements in this recent version:
- Reduced HD space requirement from 65GB to 2GB
- Decreased CPU usage by 700%
- Reduced bandwidth requirement to 1.5kb/sec
- Reduced memory requirements to a user-configurable limit

You have to be kidding yourself if you think a proof of concept written in Javascript is going to change the Bitcoin consensus in a near term time frame. I mean like *seriously delusional*.
This is coming at precisely the wrong time at precisely the wrong moment. The worst part of it is how Purse is pitching this thing, in a way that is throwing very nasty shade at anyone who makes the slightest critique.
Here's a simple way you can avoid looking like a huge distraction coming at a very convenient time: support the UASF to activate SegWit in a near term timeline and fix the BitMain Exploit. 
Then we can start to investigate the ideas behind extension blocks and this implementation and spec, which seem promising but not fully formed, requiring design, review, qa, all to alter the crown jewels of Bitcoin: the consensus rules.
When I use Purse, I sometimes hit bugs. That's fine, it's a service built on top of Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin network consensus itself has bugs, that's a totally different problem.

A DOS is where you can deny service to disrupt operations or mess up your competition
The specific issue is with certain signature verifications, with the current maximum block size the maximum time for verifications is limited to a few minutes at the absolute worst.
The current signature problem grows much worse with bigger blocks, so as an estimate a 2mb block could potentially knock people offline for 9 minutes and a 3 mb block could shut things down for 27 minutes
This issue is fixed in SegWit

I saw someone made a prebuilt version that is pre-seeded on AWS with the data so you don't need to worry about downloading (don't want to recommend that, but it exists)
It is an interesting point though, that it costs significant money **already** to run a node unless you really try to maximize your cost efficiency, even with the [current average blocksize at 0.65 MB](
So think about Gavin's statements that [an immediate bump to 20MB, even full blocks, would be no issue](
). Increasing the server requirements by 30x over the present, what kind of server do you need to rent in that situation? Could all the existing servers keep up or would it be disruptive to existing setups?
@_date: 2016-02-27 01:55:39
There are two ways that blocks are published through the network:
1. The relay network that miners use
2. The main p2p network of Bitcoin
The relay network is optimized for efficiency: it's probably the fastest way we'll ever sync blocks. It's much faster than thin blocks in both latency and bandwidth.
The p2p network is optimized for decentralization. It is inefficient at syncing blocks, it has to re-download them even though the contents of the blocks are just the transactions that it already has in its unconfirmed transactions memory pool.
Thin blocks improves the efficiency of the p2p network, if the miners use the thin blocks (they can always choose not to). It does not improve it to the level of the relay network, so that should still be used.
This technology (if and while the miners choose to use it) should therefore:
1. Reduce the need for a full node to re-download a 1mb block when it is propagated, saving some bandwidth (no more than 144mb / day) and potentially smoothing bandwidth use as well (blocks will be like 20k instead of 1mb)
2. Give a backup solution for miners if there is ever a problem with the existing relay network
There will be an increased cost to the miners to package the blocks in a thin way, but it should be small.

It could be a tiny tiny bit faster, but basically the same speed. A bitcoin transaction is formed and signed, then handed off to a full node who hands it off who hands it off until it finds its way to a miner who includes it in a block / confirmation when he finds the block solution, which happens at random times (on average every 10 minutes). If you are a full node yourself that could reduce the hops needed to get to the destination by one hop, but the time saved is probably by under a second so it's not really an advantage.
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:53:45
If it's confusing, imagine a case where there is no variance at all, every block is found every 10 minutes, and every miner has equal hashpower. Well, wait, every miner out there is finding the block every 10 minutes, so how do we decide which is the right chain? We have to wait for the next block. Except that next block happens in 10 minutes, so we have to repeat. Which chain is the longest then comes down to latency and bandwidth (which longest chain you saw first), and latency is better in some areas than others, and it's centralizing since many miners in one area have better latency to each other.
So we want this race condition where two blocks are found very close together to be quite rare, so that latency and bandwidth are not a significant advantage

It's not possible, so the code includes safeguards against what you can do with 51% of hashing power instead
A 51% attacker should not be able to change consensus rules like the coin limit or block size, the limit of their harm should be to double spend

The value increases if the amount available decreases for some reason and there is less to go around or if people want it more, like if more and more people want Bitcoin.

Your starting premise sounds a bit wrong: the failure mode of centralized miners is not rule changes: a Bitcoin node will not change its rules no matter how much hash power is applied. Centralized miners does have downsides, but it has upsides as well.


This state almost instantly disappeared the instant Bitcoins were worth anything. Satoshi had to ask people to voluntarily not use GPU mining because it was already very unbalancing.


Bitcoin isn't intended to decentralize influence, that's not possible. Free systems trend towards centralization of influence and wealth just the same way non-free systems do. It's inescapable. However unlike a government system, in Bitcoin you can't be forced to do things under threat of imprisonment or harm.


The vote is a stupid idea and it means very little. If the miners all voted 100% to increase the coin limit to 42 million, the result of that vote would be nothing, people don't have to go along with what miners vote.


Nothing stops you from running a miner already. Many altcoins have started with the premise you mention: none have escaped centralized mining. So far we have no proof of work method that resists centralization


We're not digging a hole, we're building a tunnel. There is light at the other end. There are reasons that mining is centralized, and those reasons have a great shot of going away in time
1. Mining is setup in pools. But software to create decentralized pools (p2pool) is already here and slowly getting better (it will require commoditization of ASICs to really work though)
2. Mining is setup by manufacturers. But over time they will compete with each other until they can no longer be vertically integrated, because manufacturers will make more money focusing on their areas of expertise rather than trying to do everything 
There are also constant efforts to find a more democratizing proof of work, something that resists centralized advantage. If that can be found, it can be integrated into Bitcoin.

There's only one path left. They have shown their hand. They do not want a bigger block. They want control and power, to centralize Bitcoin. When people threaten and prepare to attack you, when they define their objectives around destroying you, there is only one way forward: voluntary separation. 
Anyone who thinks that threats of attack means that you must capitulate to demands is not interested in peaceful voluntary cooperation and in fact essentially celebrates violence from people or from the state.

Bitcoin in its original form had bugs and was not a perfect system. It itself was a continuation of a series of proposals of cryptocurrency, building on the cypherpunk b-money concept, building on the hashcash proof of work concept, and on Hal Finney's work. These are a progression of ideas and implementations that are leading to a goal, of decentralized money.
Some people, like u/Bitttburger are altcoin buyers who just want to fuck over Bitcoin and make it centralized. They aren't interested in the larger goals, just in flipping the coin and getting rich quick. They accuse everyone else who has been in this for years of getting in their way. That's because their religion is greed and centralization is their messiah.

Protected against by the pseudonymity of addresses. Just hide your addresses from your competitors


That's just forensics, it doesn't work in all cases: obviously a block reward transaction has no "from address" for example.


We can fix this with coinjoins, confidential transactions. You know people's addresses because they told them to you, all they have to do is to stop telling them to people to be sheltered from this attack


DOS of any kind is considered illegal in many jurisdictions. Plus, the exchange has to honor your trades at the end of the day. They could easily shut down withdrawals in such a rare case as the network being attacked to drive down price, and then do deeper AML KYC before allowing you to walk away with your ill gotten gains


Your actions seem pretty close to the actions I'd expect of them. There are many ways they can attack, 51% is probably one of their weaker choices.

SPV was supposed to be trustless, it is not trustless, it trusts whatever the miners say. We can now see that it is broken. This also has nothing to do with voting.

I disagree with your analysis of the failure mode. In the absolute worst case scenario of your prediction, home user full nodes could fail back to just downloading blocks and not seeing or relaying unconfirmed transactions. 
Eventually no matter what you will hit the TPS max, just due to how the system is inefficient and spams everyone with everything. The decision point then will be, move nodes to more and more expensive data centers, or let the TPS sit at the maximum and push for alternatives that allow people to still run nodes? If we go with the data center model, people lose privacy and the network becomes more centralized and less peer to peer, and people are forced to place their trust in third party middlemen like whoever is running the servers. I don't want to see that data center model come to pass unless we solve the trust and privacy questions first

The thing is, someone eventually will scale a blockchain properly, using a proper sharding architecture rather than just a dumb monolith program that can't scale any faster than computers getting faster.
And that blockchain will then have a superior technology, maybe Bitcoin by then will support 100 million transactions, but a sharded network will support 100 billion transactions. And if Bitcoin decides now to give up on improving its technology by saying, "we have the status quo we don't need to improve", will that work?

It is possible and even probable one day that Bitcoin is so secure in its foundations that the block size can rise far far higher than it is today. Let me be clear: expecting better technology in the future is reasonable. Here is an example of how to safely make changes based on improved technology:


beginning to forget how terrible it turned out to be— 


a new draft— It points out that the transaction load is high enough
that even with a 100x increase in block size completion for fees would
hardly be impacted and that— because computers are 2^20 times faster
per unit cost than they were in 2013— and networks had made similar
gains, so even a common wristwatch (the personal computer embedded in
everyone's wrist at birth) could easily keep up with 100 megabyte
blocks.... so the size should be increased as of block 2,047,500.

The real story is not that Satoshi made the block limit for no reason, or way too small, or no one mentioned that it would be hard to change in the future, the evidence is right there that that story is false
Also the naming gymnastics to try to manipulate people have been going on a long time. Hearn's SPV is not Satoshi's SPV. Bitcoin "Classic" is nothing like the cypherpunk starting project, it's blatantly something to serve corporate interests over individual low trust.

It helps prevent race conditions where blocks are found at equal times and then segment the network for long periods of time
We don't want those races to persist and we don't want those races to be decided by the highest bandwidth or lowest latency: we want the highest hash power because that is more resistant to centralization advantage. See our current problems with the GFW
@_date: 2016-02-16 01:59:47
If it's not really decentralized and can't be, does that mean it can't be trustless?
- nodes, hashpower roughly uniformly distributed around the world
- in the hands of only the purest of heart
That is not what trustless means. Trustless means that even the nodes are in the hands of an evil enemy, he can't use it to hurt you. Trustless means that even if the hashpower is evil and all in one country, it can't do more than double spend its own coins, sacrificing rewards in the process
Transparent is also not a part of trustless. Ideally we will end the network being transparent, and make transactions invisible to preserve people's privacy.

This type of solution only works in a non adversarial situation, where miners are cooperating. However they are in competition with each other, so it is easy to imagine they would not cooperate. There is not a big benefit to cooperating. Therefore, it is not a solution to the worst case scenario, it is only a solution to the best case scenario. Also we already have other solutions for the best case scenario that are better than this one.

Recent improvements in Bitcoin Core for this:

- Added support for "headers first" syncing so that you don't need to back up if you have a fast connection, the blockchain will sync as fast as a torrent will download (gated by validation speed)
Some improvements coming in 0.12 (later this month):
- Validation speedup by 7x to make re-syncing from the network much faster
- Added support for "pruned mode" in the Bitcoin QT GUI to only keep a few GB
Some improvements coming in SegWit (feature complete in two months)
- Separated out signatures, to potentially allow faster sync, like skipping validation of years old signatures
- Increased block size that is opt-in, to allow you to keep a lower block size if it better suits your use case and have no need to validate SegWit transactions
- Reduced UTXO growth to keep the cached set needed smaller
- Linear time instead of quadratic time for signature validation to increase the speed of a re-sync
Also of course space is also getting cheaper / bigger all the time due to hardware tech improvements

You should be afraid of centralization, the leaders of Classic openly want increased centralization. They want to increase the block limits forever until the network is not peer to peer, it's super server to super server
See the evidence for yourself, Gavin's says many times he wants no block limit and to push trustless and private nodes out of the reach of ordinary users:




@_date: 2016-02-15 07:09:17
1. Hard forks have different prices, soft forks have the same price. There are already many hard forks of Bitcoin, like Litecoin. These hard forks would be just like Classic, they could have a different price because they would have a different ledger.
2. Mining has to happen forever, it's hoped that people will attach fees to their transactions to pay for mining in the long long term. In the short term, there is no serious need for fees to pay for mining because of how large the rewards are (we've only cut the mining reward in half one time so far)
3. Mining is similar to guessing a random number, so difficulty increasing is similar to the random number going up. The solution has to be insanely easy and fast to check by others so external "usefulness" is very difficult to achieve. Mining could potentially be useful in other ways, like making money from waste electricity, or being built into things like electric heaters to heat your home. It's possible we could change how mining works if we could find a better way to accomplish the same goals, so far no one has.
@_date: 2016-02-03 05:31:04
They are not
@_date: 2016-02-03 05:47:16
Fees depend on the network busy-ness, in recent days I've found fees of less than $0.01 confirming after a while, and transactions with a fee of $0.05 confirming very quickly. The fee also depends on the nature of the transaction, extremely complex transactions (like smart contracts) cost more.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:12:23
Ah I missed this point. Yeah my node is not in a data center, but I am used to deploying software in data centers but it's something I hadn't considered: data centers give much better bandwidth but the standard servers aren't really going to blow a home computer out of the water. Unless we figure out a way to cluster or shard a full node, we can't just keep leaning on the TPS and expect it to not require a monster server

You should use another network, just use Bitcoin on that network. *like every changtip to changetip user, every exchange to exchange user, every coinbase to coinbase user* etc.

In the beginning Classic had a way of getting support by going around asking people if they want 2MB capacity and then marking them down as "support Classic and our weird voting system and [firing all the developers]( etc." They are quite deliberate in promising nothing else for fear of scaring off what weak support they have.
In fact the entire idea of 2MB was originally a Core plan, proposed by Adam Back, [called ridiculous by Gavin]( and then realized in the SegWit plan. By December Core had already done the leg work of getting support for 2MB capacity from the miners and many in the community.
So 2MB is just a smokescreen, XT and Classic (same people, sans Hearn) are mainly efforts to "govern" Bitcoin.
As Gavin said:


Gavin self-elected himself as "Lead" by asking Satoshi to put him in that position, and in the beginning he did mostly high level cleaning work like organizing testing and filling out the tool chain, promoting Bitcoin. Over time Gavin started to try to exert control of Bitcoin, telling devs that they should take the project in a direction they disagreed with. Gavin has called the Bitcoin devs out as [liars]( [poisonous]( [negative]( [FUD spreaders]( etc, but ultimately he couldn't change the situation and he stepped down. With XT Gavin tried to force the "Benevolent Dictator" system, with Mike Hearn as the dictator, with Classic, the "voting" system, with Toomim in control of the voting apparatus

Yeah, no - they are proven liars. They won't support SegWit
If they wanted SegWit, they'd activate it. They would have absolutely zero chance of getting any hard forks by holding the network hostage, so that theory makes zero sense.
@_date: 2016-02-26 03:12:01
You should make this more clear that this is your fear, so that there can be debate about it. I'm not sure you have really listened to other points of view on whether this fear is justified
I personally think your concern is unjustified, since a miner can only double spend his own funds, which is theft - so you need someone who is willing to steal with a big amount of capital and a target who has a lot of money to steal and doesn't require identifying their customers too much. And if people are made aware of this potential, they can be also made aware to step up precautions against it
@_date: 2016-02-15 15:09:31
Rejecting the exchange is exactly what I'm doing right now - but I don't want decisions to be made this way, it's incredibly disruptive. Imagine if every time we had to make a decision we'd have to have a hard fork and then rally for each side and have sell offs on both sides. That would be so chaotic, it would make Bitcoin a joke
Here's the solution I want to see: Bitcoin remains small and limited, does only one small thing, but does it well. Bitcoin's provides digital scarcity to a wide variety of higher level applications that all battle it out amongst themselves for usefulness. Bitcoin is then like TCP/IP - a layer that only changes slightly and slowly, in uncontroversial ways, but letting tons of chaotic innovation happen on a stable foundation it provides

ASICs generally are used to hash for a pool, they don't deal with the "transactions" part of things at all, that is left up to a full node, which is just software on a normal computer.
Their blocks are empty because:
1. They can get a tiny advantage in a tiny percentage of "close call" situations where two miners find the same block at the same time
2. They haven't coded their "skip transactions" logic very well, so they are overly aggressive in skipping transactions when they don't really need to be, and the fees aren't high enough to make this a big problem for them and they don't really care about the benefit to the network of having faster confirming transactions

Hire a developer and say, "make me an auto-billing system based on Bitcoin Core".

You should switch to Electrum

For security it's just better against quantum computers because they don't know what public key to attack.

In the real world, you don't pay the Core devs shit so there is absolutely no reason you can order them around.
Bitcoin developers don't demand that other people do things they think is wrong. That's because it's a douche move.
With the Core devs hard work, Bitcoin has scaled up hugely, exponentially quickly, without major incident or downtime, and risen to a record high valuation in a short span of time. For this they've received no pay from the people they've helped, and people like you are spitting in their face. 
Core devs never demanded things from other people. You have no right to demand things of them. Especially not when you demand totally irrational things that don't make sense, or things that go against the very point of the project in order to help you make a quick buck at the expense of others.

Gavin? He loves going after people, just look at his comment history
When Core Devs say to run a full node, Gavin responds "You really like telling people what they ought to do, don't you". When core devs say that large block sizes cause problems they can't fix, "if the current set of developers can't create a secure bitcoin network that can't handle the equivalent of 4 web pages every 10 minutes, then they should be fired". When Core devs won't include his risky maneuvers, "Peter Todd is a very large part of the "Bitcoin Core moves forward too slowly" problem."  "Have fun wrestling with Luke; some bitcoiners gave up years ago." or working with Peter Todd "Todd's ego is definitely a problem." 
Gavin has about 4 core devs on his shit list (40% of that meeting) that he routinely tries to call out because they won't go along with what he and Mike Hearn want, which is to move full nodes to data centers and force people to have to trust 3rd parties if they want to use Bitcoin

From what I understand yes, Vertcoin was actually already defeated by ASICs and they had to do a hard fork to a new scheme? That's essentially no different from what Bitcoin could already do, which is just switch PoWs if ASICs started coming out. The downside of that is it would be quite disruptive. Litecoin tried the same thing and too many people were using it already so they decided to just give up on their original goal of fighting ASICs. Maybe it's a cultural problem more than a technical one though, if you could minimize disruption through a cultural solution then you wouldn't even need a fancy algorithm

At least they have changed their rhetoric, before they said "only the Core devs are against the coercive hard fork, there's no way to test for consensus and we already have it". Now they say, "let's let the majority decide, if they don't have consensus we will make them have it or else". 
@_date: 2016-02-19 07:01:02
You can look here:  at the current transactions in the global queue. Currently there are 15,000+ transactions with a non zero fee, so those will likely get picked before your transaction
Many mining pools don't even really bother with zero fee transactions and new transactions are coming in all the time, so there is no way to know exactly how long your transaction will take. At the moment, pools generally use a system where they take the highest fee transactions first
There's still a chance for your transaction though, as you can see, in the past 24 hours 800 zero fee transactions were confirmed.

Using Bitcoin should not require trusting nodes or trusting miners.
- I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, [non-trust-based system](
- With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, [without the need to trust a third party middleman]( money can be secure and transactions effortless.
- everything is based on crypto proof [instead of trust](
- At some point I became convinced there was a way to do this [without any trust required at all]( and couldn't resist to keep thinking about it.
- It [does not need to trust a node to verify payments]( it can still verify them itself. 
Of course "Classic" throws out this concept of "no trust". As evidenced by their founding members statements:
- I understand you want to build an extremely decentralized system, where everybody participating trusts nothing except the genesis block hash. [I think it is more interesting to build a system that works for hundreds of millions of people](
- I think there will be at least three different sets of people: 1. People who [trust a web site to keep their wallet safe more than they trust themselves](
).  They'll use sites like MyBitcoin or MtGox, which give them an online wallet.
- I am willing to run SPV mode because [I trust that my customers aren't going to double spend]( against me. 
- If you don't [trust miners to want bitcoin to succeed](
) then you should move to a proof of stake coin
- "If I cant trust the miners and merchants anymore as a group, then its game over anyway"

The severity of overt boosting needs to be judged to make that determination. It's very hard to judge that if the boosting is covert, so getting rid of the covert form is a no-brainer obvious bug fix.
Obviously if someone had a patent on SHA256d and no one else was allowed to do it, that would be a big problem requiring a fix (From what I hear, that is likely why we have ECDSA signatures and not Schnorr from the start). So the answer lies somewhere in a gray area.

There's no such thing as the "official" Bitcoin price. If you care about saving 1%, you can always register on those other sites that sell cheaper, that's the beauty of Bitcoin
The other thing that is not obvious is that there are actually two prices for Bitcoin, there is the price that someone is willing to sell at: $x and the price that someone is willing to buy at $y. Every time you buy, you are matched up to someone willing to sell at $x. Every time you sell, you are matched to someone willing to sell at $y. $x is not the same as $y - there are two prices

I don't think it's right to imply that Bitcoin is stagnant
When Satoshi first was designing Bitcoin, he looked at various types of transactions that need to be modeled and there were many more than just "send from A -&gt; B"
In order to deal with that, he designed Bitcoin to be based on a transaction scripting system, you could call this "programmable money". Even a standard A -&gt; B transaction uses this scripting system.
From the beginning Satoshi talked about how the scripting system would enable multisig transactions and complicated other scripts to model more transaction types. These were developed after Satoshi left, but they were implementing design ideas that were sketched out before Bitcoin was even published, ideas that Satoshi deliberately designed Bitcoin to support.
With SegWit and other proposals like Confidential Transactions, Bitcoin will continue being upgraded and improved, the worry in fact is that the Blockchain will be improved faster than wallets can implement these improvements in a user friendly way
Sidechains have a lot of promise, but the Blockchain is still where it's at

Even the current Bitcoin core team agree that with greater growth in usage there will need to be a change in blocksize eventually, so the hard fork is just a matter of timing.
The core dev team don't get to decide this, the community at large do (even if the core devs do the hard fork). However, I agree that no move should be committed to create a contentious blockchain hard fork, so the flow should work like: 1) get everyone on board first, 2) pull the trigger

Can you link to your transaction please? I'm about 1000% sure you are totally full of shit so I would appreciate some context :)
@_date: 2016-02-12 12:26:18
Here is what I think:
Any centrally controlled currency, whether it is by a cabal of companies or a committee of central bankers is doomed.  We need a decentralized, non-trust-based system.
Miners should only serve the purpose of creating a distributed timestamp, determining which transaction was the first to spend a coin.  Users should transact directly with each other, only using the mining system to check for a double spend.
This creates a currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, so that money can be secure and transactions effortless.  It means that everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust
What happens if your country locks off internet access to the outside world? It wont' matter.  Any node with access to both sides will be able to pass the blockchain through with a dial-up modem or sat-phone.  Only one node would be necessary to do this.
What happens if the chain is annoyingly large for tiny devices?  Well users control the system, and they can get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's accessible for lots of users and small devices.
What will happen when blocks fill up? It will follow a standard bidding mechanism.  After the first 50KB sells out, the price is raised.  After 250KB is sold, it goes up.  At some price, you can pretty much always get in if you're willing to outbid the others.
I'm not saying that Bitcoin is perfect now as it is.  The project needs to grow slowly so the system can be strengthened as we go. We can try making SPV clients that do not need to trust a node to verify transactions, they can still verify them themselves. 
The idea of Bitcoin is that there is a way to have a currency without any trust required at all.

Quite concerned. Millions of people do dumb things together, look at Democracies. 
How to prevent it? There's not one all encompassing solution, but yes trying to get correct information out there is part of it.
The consensus rules (that protect the 21 million coin limit and the other fundamental properties of Bitcoin) only offer protection if: 1. They are coded properly. 2. People use clients that use the rules. 3. People aren't able to be tricked into changing the rules. 
So there are three steps to make sure that the consensus rules work
1. Make sure that the code of Bitcoin is done properly by experts and well vetted and can't change too easily
2. Make sure that people actually run clients that validate the rules 
3. Educate people on the system so they see why they should care about the consensus rules and make it harder for them to be tricked

An artificial barrier for transactions is necessary for the same reason that an artificial barrier is necessary for the coin limit and coin distribution.
Consider why do we have a 25 coin reward right now, but after this summer we will have a 12 coin reward? That doesn't seem very market based.
You can't just remove all the limits and then say, "the market will decide", when there are external costs involved.

SegWit is pretty cool, they've got the support of all the major wallets and the fixes to Bitcoin are huge: 
1. End "malleability spam" that tries to confuse people by making duplicates of their transaction
2. Improve verification time for signatures to be f(x) = x instead of f(x) = x^2
3. Potentially make hardware wallets simpler and cheaper than the $99 Trezor by reducing the complexity required
4. Fix security hole in smart contracts where a multisig signatory (like BitGo, or Coinbase vault) can potentially brute force your signature, stealing your funds
5. Versioned scripts for open ended future Blockchain smart contracts - opening the door for Confidential Transactions and improved Bitcoin fungibility / privacy
6. Reduced memory footprint, allowing more scalability of node mempools, reducing the cost of a node
7. Opens potential to fix security holes in SPV clients that would allow miners to print new coins without SPV clients noticing

Sounds to me like Coinbase (backed by banks, is a bank, Gavin works for them as a paid and invested advisor) wants to:

- Extinguish: prevent Lightning Network from offering lower fees and instant trades in a decentralized way

Imagine if you are building a bridge. You don't build it for the average day's traffic. You build it for what happens if every car is a heavy truck. You add a safety margin. If you weaken the supports for a bridge and then run light cars over it and say, "mission accomplished", you are just asking for a heavy truck day to come along and destroy your bridge.
Just because they participate in the relay network now, doesn't mean they always will. And a big reason why they wouldn't not participate, is precisely because blocks are small enough now that it wouldn't really give them much of an advantage if they didn't participate.
If they participate in an open relay, it will be harder for them to segregate out the 49% of miners, since those 49% can just join the open relay.

The quotes about fees refer to the possible upsides of a fee market, they do not mean the people saying them "want to see a fee market emerge ASAP".
Or do you think Gavin wants a fee market immediately? Here is [his quote](


So the core devs are saying something similar: that a fee market Bitcoin is not wholly bad, it has both positives and negatives.


Fee pressure is an intentional part of the system to prevent overuse. In early days, the network was flooded with what were called "penny floods", where people tried to send tons of transactions to stress things out. To counteract this, Satoshi changed fee rules to create a system that was resistant to this behavior.


Every time you add a transaction to the network, there is a non zero cost to every single node on the network. This cost is small by itself, but multiplied by hundreds of thousands of transactions and thousands of nodes, it becomes a large cost in total. Fees help to balance this cost imbalance








Higher fees would result in a market opportunity for people who have ideas on how to improve the overall scalability of the system. This creates an incentive to create new and diverse solutions


In 25 years it would be good if fees provided some security, that is part of the initial whitepaper and design. It is not ASAP as you said

I doubt it, he's making it seem like the only acceptable response for Europe is to continue to subsidize Greece.
The answer wants to hear I'm sure is that Greece should say fuck off to their creditors, start fresh with Bitcoin as the official currency, open their immigration doors to startups of the world and say: "we're building a new modern digital economy, develop in Greece".
Not so likely :/ 
Greece is firmly trapped in their position by large systemic forces and Germany's reluctance to give up on their idiotic cost cutting plans. It makes zero sense to slow down all the work done by government in order to cut costs without correspondingly encouraging some other enterprise to take up the slack. That just leads to 50% of young workers unemployed like we see in Greece. It's the cousin of the stupid starve the beast plan republicans use to justify massive government spending combined with tax cuts.
Socialism works ok in Europe when you have a reasonable and uncorrupt economic base, a somewhat accountable government, and a decent education system. When those aren't present, socialism's wheels fall off

Users are the only people who really count in a hard fork, because if the miners decide to make hard fork blocks users must upgrade their node to accept them. By users yes I mean full nodes, but anyone who is not running a full node is just proxying their use of a full node to someone else. 
I think the future of what will happen in a hard fork where there is significant contention is not really predictable. There are so many variables, things could go smoothly, or they could go wrong.

I can tell you that for many people, doing a hard fork is a religious issue, if it's done under inauspicious circumstances. For example, I can't support the vision of Gavin to uncap the blocksize completely and leave it in the hands of the miners. I would definitely be religious about opposing that direction
I can tell you that for many people, merely being in Bitcoin is a religious affair, something that we believe in despite the challenges. At the core there are values of making a trustless system and what that represents for freedom, and we can't go against those values by supporting people who don't share them against people who do

There is likely a hidden player who has excess hash power that he is hiding in other pools. This is likely to be an ASIC manufacturer, if you look at the hash power changes recently and work backwards based on pool change rates

It is also going to be the only way that we can get instant transactions that a merchant can actually rely upon completing

Nice article
I think that the mistake and moral problem that Gavin is making with his hard fork conceptualization is to proceed from the assumption that he is right, and that since he is right, he can do what he likes in order to accomplish his goal, because his is the right goal. 
1. Most users won't know that a consensus rule has changed, and special care is being taken just so that they won't know and just so that they won't be given the choice. This is being spun as OK because "the change is right and therefore users shouldn't be given the choice of the wrong answer, so their possible desire to choose the wrong answer is not important".
2. Disruption to the mining system is being used as a cudgel to try and force change. Instead of giving a separate option and having the miners just leaving as they wish organically in a way that would be compensated for by the dynamic difficulty adjustment, this fork attempts to organize them to leave all at once in a disruption maximizing way, in order to have as good a chance as possible of stopping the miners who do not leave. This is being spun as OK because "the change is right and therefore miners who don't want to change are choosing the wrong answer, so their possible desire to stay on the existing rules is not important".

[Based on the past year]( it seems like we have on average 150k users who make a transaction once a day (150,000 people * 365 days = 50 million new transactions this year)

Two ways to make this happen:
1. Have people demand decentralized mining so much, that if mining is not decentralized voluntarily by the centralizing parties, the miners are penalized with PoW changes. It's hard to know how decentralized mining is if miners try to hide it, but we could make educated guesses that wouldn't be too far off.
2. Commoditize the cost of being a miner as much as possible, so that everyone is on equal footing when it comes to mining. This means lowering the requirements to be a competitive miner: labor, capital, access to specialized manufacturing, etc. Commoditized mining would mean that mining would be spread out to where electricity was cheap: cheap electricity is a fairly widely spread out resource.

Yes indeed, if factionalism is a result of a hard fork, it will be tough to resolve and make for an unbelievably awful user experience for many many users. It will degrade the trust in Bitcoin for years, maybe decades for fear of a repeat.


This is not possible to guarantee. Even with the current scam altcoins on the market, they have a sizeable percentage of Bitcoin's market cap. Now consider an altcoin that is actually backed by the best and most experienced crypto developers, and the most dedicated and hardcore holders.

The process for changes to Bitcoin is carefully documented in the bitcoin repository, go take a look. Changes happen quite frequently, they go through initial discussion, coding, mailing list discussion, formal BIP, final discussion, final implementation

The only problem with keeping large sums on LN is that your channel partner fails somehow and your funds are locked until the timeout, which could be inconvenient. If this problem can be solved or proven to not be a significant risk, or you just don't mind taking it, I don't see any reason you wouldn't keep 100% of your funds in Lightning.
OK maybe that's not good enough?


They can top them up, but yeah it requires a new transaction, if it's from a non-LN source.


I think this can be done in 1 transaction so that it doesn't add much strain over the case of you just already having your funds in your normal wallet. You can think of your LN funds as if they are just a multisig wallet, they are as efficient as any normal multisig wallet would be since from the perspective of the Blockchain that is what they are.

The problem with your analogy is that the block size increase is not their objective. Their objective is centralization, with them at the center. You're just thinking about it all wrong.
The centralization process is the poison: having miners threaten attacks to get their way, then offer appeasement terms as a false promise that the end of troubles is in sight.
SegWit is not what we want, that is not the nutritious meal. What we want is to have a stable blockchain that is free of central parties dictating how it works. That's Bitcoin. SegWit is a nice addition to the meal, but it is not the meal.

You can fold multiple sends into a single transaction. If you have multiple sends, it's recommended to fold them together because it's more efficient, but not infinitely more

Nodes aren't really for syncing the blockchain, they are a lot more than that. 
Partial seeding of the blockchain could be possible in the future but there is no real need for it at the moment, the blockchain is considered very well seeded and this is not why nodes are needed for decentralization. 
For decentralization it's important that people validate things themselves so they can't be tricked or pushed around by someone else. This makes the network hard to manipulate, you need people to go along with you voluntarily.

LN does have some issues, it's not even my preferred solution, but his article seems to make mountains out of molehills


No scalability solution exists, that's the issue at hand. Lightning does in fact exist as a well reviewed white paper, a plan in motion, a top notch team, published open source code


This makes no sense, users are transparent to both the Blockchain and Lightning. By my estimates the blockchain can handle up to 100-180 million individual users on Lightning without being proxied


Legitimate point, but I think from the wrong perspective. People are too trusting of Coinbase and Circle type hosted wallets and they will probably choose those over Lightning, at first.


Sounds unlikely since Lightning will probably make a reference wallet. Plenty of people will also like instant confirmations, improved privacy and tiny micropayments and lower fees right? Legit point that it will take time for wallets that people like and they use to be widespread. It might never happen


2/3 of the transactions on the blockchain are $5 and under. Large transactions can live on chain for a while because it's easier to justify the fee


Not all centralization is bad. The important part is trustless and resistant to attack, that's the goal of decentralization. Lightning is designed in such a way where it does offer those features


Again, most real life transactions are small. Lightning is a complementary network, not a replacement for the blockchain


100% of funds are subject to market volatility. This is a non sequitur 


This only applies to relays, not users. Users can still hold cold keys.

With pruning and blocks only syncing, the price of running a node is going to become way cheaper
I could see full nodes running on mobile phones: 2gb of pruned Blockchain isn't too bad and the initial sync setup could be done overnight or via proxy to a desktop mode to do the initial validation. Every day you need to sync 144 mb but it could do it when connected to wifi 
This also pushes the blocksize network storage cost to utxo instead, which is still significant but much less so in the near term

[Any node with access to both sides would automatically flow the block chain over, such as someone getting around the blockade with a dial-up modem or sat-phone](

The misdirected hype is very frustrating to me. Clearly there is a big market for trustless systems that work between companies and use cheap smart contracts instead of expensive legal contracts. Millions and millions of dollars are being poured into this concept. However you just can't build a trustless system on top of a trusted system. If your smart contracts depend on fiat, you can always go a level above to the legal system and get the fiat reversed. So everything you built in the smart contract system is just a thin veneer of safety, you still need the expensive legal contracts.

You can pay someone else as long as you both are connected to the LN network, there is no need to close the channel or open a new one


1. Parties can instantly re-spend funds to any LN party who is connected
2. Funds locked in the channel are only "locked" in the failure mode of getting harshly disconnected from the network. While you are connected to the network in the normal scenario you can pay anyone inside the network, or leave the network at any time.
There is one limitation that complicates things, which is the channel opening. If you want to add funds from outside Lightning, that requires a new transaction. If someone else wants to send you more funds than you can receive on Lightning due to the limits of the channel opened with you, that also requires a new transaction.

Let's put it plainly without semantic bullshit. Without a limit, miners can create block sizes that are larger. Larger block sizes means larger costs to me. Miners don't compensate me for that cost, they don't even ask me. So without the limit, I am not protected from that behavior. 
An unrestrained miner could make 10 terabytes of block data and effectively block me from validating from home. That's why I want the limit, to protect my interests.

If your first concern is security, look into paper wallets where you can take your funds offline. This allows you to store your money as an image file, or printed on a piece of paper or many pieces of paper in your wallet or safe deposit box, etc.
Since you can make copies of your paper you can protect against accidental loss, and since its offline no online hacker could possibly steal your bitcoin. Accessing your funds from a paper wallet is as easy as scanning a qr code. 
It's definitely a good idea to be cautious, at this point in the life cycle of bitcoin there is no player established enough to trust 100% with the security of your funds if you invest in a significant amount.

Buying BTC


It depends what you want, and where you are. Localbitcoins has a wide range of options. Circle is convenient for a lot of people. ATMs can be pretty cool. Different solutions for different needs


You should check out Electrum, or if you have a lot of coins, try Trezor. bitcoin.org has many options with the pros and cons of each. Do not store your coins with any web wallet.


Different ATMs work differently, there are multiple models. Sometimes they use a QR code that you can sweep, sometimes you show them an address and they send it to you. bitcoin.org has a variety of good wallets, but also do not leave any large amount of coins in a mobile wallet
@_date: 2016-02-05 09:52:54
How do you imagine Bitcoin scaling to billions of people? All of these people broadcast every one of their transactions to every other person?

Obviously it would be great to have lower fees but they are an important part of the existing system so there's no easy answer
Nevertheless you can try some existing projects like the Brave web browser, they are already experimenting with the idea of micropayments for visiting websites
Unfortunately there is also another big barrier to micro payments being feasible for web sites which is Bitcoin adoption and payment reluctance. Generally people perceive the gap between free and $anyMoney as much larger than is rational.

Proof of work means that you prove that work was done. If you code to do less work (work is actually work times time), you are proving less, so you are removing the main thing that stops people from cheating: the work they have to prove which is expensive to do

You should avoid sharing your xpub with anyone if you don't have a good reason to.
One situation where you might want to use an xpub is if you are confident your seed is in cold storage and always will be, then you can put your xpub somewhere hot and use it to generate addresses for your cold storage. As long as the seed never leaks any keys, leaking the xpub by accident or through a hack isn't a big deal.

SegWit should solve two problems for people: 
1. Transactions should get cheaper by about half, miners may have to take a small pay cut
2. People can stop worrying about transaction shenanigans like where evil nodes alter incoming transactions to make them bigger so their effective fee is lower and the evil node's transactions are prioritized. 
LN is kind of an open question, but theoretically it will let you do cool things like make a fast trading Bitcoin exchange where customers keep control of their own coins, to solve the exchanges getting hacked problems

Bitcoin is just a shared history, it's not too complicated, and anyone can see this shared history. What you describe is not logical because it involves people just willingly ignoring the history data they all have a copy of. 
Of course there could be weird problems in the code, but then we get to the next part of why your scenario is flawed: the person who could exploit those to get infinite coins would probably be highly motivated for people to use the currency and give it value: destroying the currency to get more coins would be pointless

Do the other assets you track have similar levels of volume and liquidity? Volatility and large price movements are related to Bitcoin's small size and the makeup of the holders, miners.

Simply put, there is a global database which is the blockchain, and your transfer actually occurs there. If you look up the transaction id on a block explorer you can see if it occurred there.

This is how u/jgarzik and others have truly pitched 2x, behind closed doors. As a way for them to wrest some imaginary control away from Core developers who they feel are not excercising this “control” enough. They complain about death threats, while they falsely claim that Core developers have control: encouraging others to threaten the Core developers.
Core developers have repeatedly said they do not control Bitcoin, first because Bitcoin is decentralized and not controlled by any company or developer, but also because that mistaken understanding is dangerous to their safety as it has and will result in misled people threatening them and their families.
For people’s safety, Jeff Garzik and the other leaders of 2x need to disown this false narrative and clearly state that the Core developers do not control Bitcoin and that the miners and 2x signers also do not control Bitcoin. When asked in the past to do so, Jeff Garzik and others have always refused, even pointedly when presented with discrete examples of death threats on the volunteer developer team. Vinny has even defended his statements about 2x as saying that he simply wants to force Core to change how they control Bitcoin. 
It’s a false narrative and a dangerous narrative and it is terrible for Bitcoin to create this illusion that Bitcoin’s consensus rules are subject to the whims of some small set of people, whether they are the 12 people present at the NYA meeting or the top contributors to the Bitcoin Core project. As we have seen, and will continue to see, Bitcoin is a decentralized project that is not under anyone’s control.

This applies if you have bcash and send it by mistake to a Bitcoin SegWit address, like to an exchange, which is a reasonable mistake since bcash chose to use the same exact address format to be maximum assholes, and can reasonably start to happen more and more as exchanges and wallets switch to SegWit to save on fees.
If the person generating that Bitcoin address made a SegWit address, that means that the output script requires SegWit be activated before it is safe to use that address. This is why Bitcoin Core did not allow SegWit address generation to happen before SegWit activated.
Since SegWit never activated on bcash it is not safe to use there and the coins will probably be lost, the incentive there is to just steal the coins, and the lead developer says that the miners should do that.
Another good reason to stick to Bitcoin, it has responsible development processes that actually care about preventing people from losing money by accident.

If miners and vcs can threaten people to get them to change the consensus rules, then those consensus rules aren’t useful since the rules are overridden by whatever the miners and vcs want.
The Bitcoin tech only works if people use it properly. If you store your bitcoins at MTGox, they may be taken from you. If you let miners and Barry Silbert decide the consensus rules, you don’t have a decentralized currency anymore and your coins may be redefined entirely into something you don’t want.
Even unknowingly, many people will run a version of Bitcoin software that does not include support for replay attack protection. We can’t expect that everyone will be able to do the right thing in eight weeks. Since 2x has refused replay protection support, people will lose money by sending coins they didn’t mean to. 2x needs to add 2-way replay protection to stop this from being a problem.

It's the same message, said over and over by the same people.
It's backed up with real actions like deliberately trying to cause problems with the stated motive of killing the Core chain by refusing replay protection code.
When people protest, they are sued for billions of dollars, threatened with tens of millions of dollars in targeted attacks and more: 
OpenBazaar is part of this so-called agreement which went around to various businesses to threaten them


These are aggressive moves. If OpenBazaar wants to support more chains to chase cheaper fees or other users, that's fine. That's a perfectly fine solution to trying to create a useful tool. It's when OpenBazaar and others coordinate to threaten and attack that it goes way over the line. And there is absolutely no need to do that.

As long as we stay on the segwit course we are likely to solve scaling for most common uses of Bitcoin, and if usage of Bitcoin keeps increasing we should see a 100% uptake in segwit. There is no reason anyone would not want to use segwit, it is cheaper and has no drawbacks.
In the future with the current segwit roadmap we will also get aggregated signatures and MAST which should improve scaling as well

If they lose the majority hashrate then 2x is abandoned and the price of those coins will go to zero. If you have 2x coins now in the form of 2x futures be warned that those have an almost certain chance of becoming totally worthless.
If miners mine the altcoin instead of bitcoin they will be giving up around $75,000 every ten minutes.
Some dishonest mining is to be expected. But it’s reasonable to expect that given the large holdings and market pressure of people who don’t want the 2x coin that the majority of the miners will continue to be honest so that they can continue to collect a high block reward value.

Creating an altcoin like bcash or 2x is not a protocol upgrade. That is just a marketing label designed to sell those coins. 
If people aren’t going along with your ideas for a new coin, it’s smart for your own sake to try to win them over by making it easy to support your coin, not trying to maximize difficulty in the hopes of people just giving in.
It’s like a sex pest asking you over and over to just give in to his carnal desires. “Let’s just get it over with.” “I won’t take no for an answer”. Well maybe that works a few times with people who are not prepared for it, but it’s wrong and it won’t work on people who are prepared for it.

If you write a critical piece on Bitcoin don't be so lazy as to bring up old concerns and then not address the common response to those concerns
Also stating your opinion does not qualify as an argument 
- Bitcoin brings out the worst in people.
This is your opinion and you could say the same about any form of money
- Bitcoin is 90% politics
A political solution is needed because the financial system is broken due to political problems not technical. We've had better tech for a long long time, the incentives for the financial industry to use it is not there because they have a political monopoly
- Bitcoin does not scale
With no proof to back this up, and in fact many open source tests that show that Bitcoin does in fact scale, this is not a valid point. It's easy to beat the current benchmark of $45 and 5 business days to transmit the change of two balances in a database
- The community has undesirable elements
It might be true, but communities change. The internet used to be for perverts to get porn quickly. Now it's only half that
- Without internet there is no Bitcoin
That's the basis for any digital system by definition: digital communication is the baseline. Bitcoin if anything is resistant to connectivity issues since signatures can be transmitted over many channels, radio, USB drives, etc. You can't just block its IP like blocking Twitter or Facebook
- Somebody might figure out your private key
The odds of that are essentially zero. The proof is in the math that's open source and for everyone to see, and just basic common sense when you think about how large a number a private key represents
- Bitcoin can be used for illegal purposes
Bitcoin is a tool, not even a violent tool like a gun, it's a tool of communication like the telephone. This argument applies to all tools
- Bitcoin is valued by shared delusion 
This applies to literally all value. Value by definition is what people believe something is worth. If they change their minds, the value changes
- Miners who make money are burning CPU cycles with cheap energy
10 min of research would tell you CPUs are worthless for mining and equipment cost is the major cost for mining
- Dead people's bitcoins
Basically this is the same as a numbered Swiss bank account. If you want to perpetuate wealth to your kids, just write the number in your will. Bitcoin even gives more options with things like NLockTime so you could give your kids a monthly stipend without the need for a lawyer
- Banking is nice in Austria
If you don't have problems in a rich first world country, it doesn't mean you will never have problems in your country or that all countries are as problem free as yours. Even the U.S. has terribly slow and annoying banking

Choosing chains is fine. Trezor allows choosing chains. If you want to choose a chain that isn’t Bitcoin, go ahead.

Losing money will always be a part of the Bitcoin experience for half of the people involved (represented by value invested), because it behaves like a commodity and not a stock
A commodity can never make everyone rich, it's just a token that's passed around between people. Tokens are useful but they don't do anything on their own.
A company is more than a token passed around, it's a new synthesis of something that did not exist before, so it has the potential to make everyone rich with wealth that did not exist previously
Unfortunately we live in a world where it's difficult to buy companies in a decentralized way, and since the concept of owning a company is pretty much enforced and given meaning by the government, I'm not sure that will ever change

With a free market there will be opportunities for you to hedge your bets and maintain a wallet with a value relative to some fixed point you prefer, this exists already with bitreserve and coinapult
What there won't be until Bitcoin is a thousand times bigger is a gentle rise and fall of the price. It takes too little to move a small market, it's like expecting a small boat not to move in a choppy sea. We just need a bigger boat

Bugs is a very broad term, basically it just means "problems with the software"
Of course problems will arise, but they will be dealt with in a large number of ways, there's no simple answer to this broad question
When problems arise with the clients, the clients will have to fix it according to whatever processes they have in place. 
Although it's hard to design software to have zero problems, it's easy to design software that won't do totally random things: it's easy to design a calculator app that doesn't respond to HTTP requests, even by accident
Most of the protections behind really bad things happening in Bitcoin are based on designing things so they are logically separated from very bad problems. 
At the core of that is the blockchain which is a simple history of everything: it's not like the blockchain will start flipping numbers and changing everyone's balances because that would require fabricating history and doing things that are totally different from what it is designed to do

The major barrier is people. I go out and talk to people about Bitcoin, to try and get them to accept it. 
Because Bitcoin is not backed by a company that would bug people or educate people about their product, it would require that people who are enthusiastic about Bitcoin to fill that role
Peoples response is generally uninformed and negative. Because using Bitcoin is hard work, they are not wrong. You need to learn about it and invest some time figuring it out for yourself, it's not just "spendable cash in my bank" as people are accustomed to.
There is also a tangible real world backlash to Bitcoin, the trolls in this forum are somewhat representative of a common reaction to Bitcoin, which is that they see it in a cynical light that challenges their world view of how money should work. It's easy to be cynical and think that everything is bogus, it takes effort to believe in a new way of doing things. And many things are in fact bogus which makes it even easier to be cynical
Basically I'm saying that Bitcoin requires hard work and it won't take off in an elliptical way because there are strong resistant factors holding it down

Check your math:
Assuming: 1 million dollars in 2075 is 120 thousand of today's dollars (historical rate extrapolated)
If bitcoin grows 100x its peak in "real dollars" it would be 120k of today's dollars. If at the same time dollars continue to lose value at the historical rate, then there will come a point when 1 BTC == 1 million non inflation adjusted dollars

It's going to be very difficult to tell, miners are heavily incentivized to use cost effective energy sources, and can do so in efficient ways not possible with normal energy use
There's a ton of "energy" in the universe, it's a very broad term. In the long term miners should really trend towards using waste energy, like using excess energy produced by power plants at night, that's going to be the cheapest source because it's not suitable for many other uses

When you want to transport it? Armored trucks. Want to verify it exists? Travel to where it is and test it. Tons of wasted energy
There have been a lot of attempts to improve upon Bitcoin's proof of work algorithm, but none of them are more efficient. If there were, it's possible to alter the proof of work algorithm without any disruption to the network
There have also been a lot of attempts to build a decentralized digital currency similar to Bitcoin without using proof of work, but none of those have succeeded. It might not be possible.

Principally it hurts your privacy
Bitcoin is not anonymous but it's not public either, there is a middle ground: it's somewhat private
When you reuse addresses it very strongly links transaction A with transaction B. 
As far as dangerous from a crypto perspective, it's possible although not definite that a new type of computer will come along that can brute force things at a new level that was unanticipated by the current algorithms. In that case address reuse could be a vulnerable target, whereas non reuse (from not to) should be safe because the brute force target information is then never published, so it's impossible to ever "forge" signatures

There are already competing implementations: the previous versions. If you want, you can just run the incorruptible saint's version of Bitcoin forever
There's two separate issues: the consensus logic and the rest of the code. The consensus logic is in the process of being boiled down into a separate consensus library. Once that is done, other clients can share the core protocol as defined by the consensus library, and then mess with the other non protocol stuff as much as they want
Changing the core protocol will create damage. It's like why should we use unicode, let's have lots of different encodings all incompatible with each other, or why should we use JSON, let's have super JSON that has tons of new features, etc. The point of Bitcoin is to create a currency protocol, and the point of protocols is that they remain simple and stable foundations upon which other things can be built.

Confront them and tell them what they are doing is wrong and you don't agree with it and it's just a greedy get rich quick scheme you want no part of. If there were real features that were an improvement over Bitcoin, the right way to approach that would be to publish whitepapers and get review of the concept, not do a premine + pump of a new altcoin.
And the same should apply to anyone who pitches you on Bitcoin as "get in on the ground floor because each one will be worth 1 million dollars someday". Bitcoin should be promoted as a useful utility or as a mechanism of free speech, not as a get rich quick scheme.

Computing power will likely increase tremendously in the 100 years it will take for the coin rewards to cease. Parsing and syncing the blockchain will be breathtakingly easy for our robot overlords in 2115. 
If you mean mining, which is designed to take a lot of power, that's kind of an open question but it doesn't matter too much, there's a pretty direct relationship between all the interests involved so that 51% attacks will still be fairly unlikely even at a lower total block reward, if fees don't replace block rewards as they were intended to

Your solution to a problem that takes 2 cents to solve on rare occasions is to add 20 cents on all occasions.
They say those who can: do. Those who can't: teach. You have yet to even make a bitcoin transaction and you constantly spam threads with your ill informed guides on how to improve it. 
If you had made even a single  bitcoin transaction you might realize that spurious traffic is not true competition to real transactions, no one is going to enter a bidding war with the entire network over transactions for no legit reason. The only transactions that are threatened are those made by out of date or poorly made clients, or transactions of tiny amounts. 
Speculating that the market will just randomly stop being volatile gives away your total lack of economic common sense. In a free market, the price of commodities will always fluctuate.
People obsessed with the block size or critics who don't bother to actually learn what Bitcoin is about fail to realize that Bitcoin is a currency. It can do everything every other currency can do. The whole world ran on gold until Nixon and that stuff is a bitch to move around, try getting a billion people to use that. Except people did, through abstracted channels. The only thing you can't do with Bitcoin is print more of it than is dictated by the code. So at worst it's a more predictably printed currency.

To get the same result I would just let them indicate their vote like in BIP 100, that would save them from having to stuff tx
In general though I think we should be doing all we can to remove power from the miners, they are one of the most dangerous points of centralization in the system. As you point out miners can already do some nasty stuff, so the more centralized they are and the more power an individual miners has, the more risk is introduced
I'm like you though, I think tx should drive the block size. I'd like to see a system of recycling block rewards: for example a miner could decide to give up the block reward and take only fees instead, but without the low cap. This could prove that fees will take over for block rewards. The block reward is then added to the next next half point so that the total BTC count is maintained and a safety net of transaction traffic possibly going down is extended into the future.

My first concern is that people are informed. I think there is a lot of misinformation flying around and people should be trying to gather all the facts: let people make their own decision without pressure or misinformation or speculation presented as fact
It would be bad if people could damage Bitcoin by misinforming people about something and then people would make decisions based on bad information, that's basically fraud.
Some speculative things I see presented as fact with no real validation:
1. Blockstream has an agenda to keep the block size low or to hurt Bitcoin
2. Theymos has been paid off by Blockstream
3. Nick Szabo has been paid off by Blockstream
4. Lightning Network needs small blocks to work
5. Lightning Network uses a different value token than Bitcoin
6. Sidechains need small blocks to work
7. Miners decide hard forks, users don't get a say
8. There is clear consensus around BIP 101 except for Blockstream
9. No matter what, the longest chain is always the correct chain
10. Blockstream doesn't want SPV clients to work
11. 1MB blocks means high fees like $25 and up
12. Bitcoin Core developers are paid by Blockstream except Gavin/Jgarzik
13. Bitcoin must be both a store of value and a universal payment network for every transaction in the world
14. Consensus means taking a vote, majority wins
15. When there is a hard fork, one side of the hard fork will always die off immediately, there is no chance of both sides surviving
16. Lightning Network is designed to promote centralization
17. Lightning Network is designed to generate fee revenue for Blockstream
18. Hard forks have no potential to cause problems for existing clients
19. The development of Bitcoin will continue unchanged except for the block limit in Mike Hearn's repo

There are so many individual Bitcoin units (each coin is 100 million) that accidental loss can basically never cause a serious problem to the system as a whole. Also accidental loss should decrease as the value goes up and people are incentivized more to avoid losing coins, and as wallet tech gets better and makes it easier to avoid losing coins

Sidechains are just altcoins. There's only 1 difference: a sidechain can be designed to peg their currency value at a 1:1 ratio to Bitcoin by allowing people to do 1:1 swaps for Bitcoins
1 Satoshi swaps are not that likely because when you swap a sidechain coin for a bitcoin, you will still need to follow Bitcoin's dust rules.
It's very unlikely that any blockchain can survive without its token being valuable. That is because the token value is a fundamental assumption of how the blockchain is designed.
People are excited about the blockchain because it's interesting and new technology, and not about Bitcoin because it's old tech: it's just money.
When the Internet came out, people thought: we will just be using dumb screens connected to a super cloud in the sky and CPUs and PCs etc are dead meat. Lots of money was invested in this idea. That was just people getting overly excited about the possibilities of the Internet, just like people are getting overly excited about the blockchain possibilities.

Some people have suggested sidechains can fill this role since their value is pegged to Bitcoin and the exchange doesn't require a trading partner
But the settlement back to Bitcoin still takes a transaction and you don't necessarily get the same security guarantees and it can make everything more complicated
@_date: 2015-09-15 04:36:43
I think if Bitcoin is handling 56,000 legit transactions per second the market value of all the coins will be higher than 40 billion dollars. In that case your fee would be wrong since it can adjust to market conditions. It's people paying these fees, if they are too high they will find a different solution until the market adjusts the fee rate to be something that they want to pay
There are other ways to transact Bitcoin than the Bitcoin network, as much as it pains people to hear that. Off chain transactions between trusted people or via alternative trust-less exchange channels can drastically reduce the use of the chain while still using Bitcoin as the unit of account.

Also put Bitcoin into context. It's not an alternative to a waste free system, it's an alternative to a banking system that has thousands of physical bank branches that have lights and air conditioning and vault locks and armored trucks and ATMs, those things also cost billions to run every year, and that system doesn't have a built in end date like Bitcoin blockchain rewards do

Another workaround is to setup your node alongside millions of other nodes like people do when they rent nodes from node providers or run them on ec2.

It depends on the wallet, I'm not sure how it works in mycelium but some wallets won't let you re-spend unconfirmed transactions or will warn you. In Electrum freezing would work, however I don't recommend using your seed like that because you may get unexpected results due to implementation differences between the two clients
I recommend  for trades like this, they will deal with the confirmation uncertainty for you, in a trustless and easy way
I wouldn't sweat it a huge amount, if you sent fiat, unless you handed over cash it's really the other guy who has to worry
It may take longer than an hour to confirm though. Don't do zero confirmation trades with people you don't know / high value amounts

I feel like he is saying that nodes have their place in consensus, not that miners are not important in the consensus equation. If 51% of miners could decide everything, we'd have BIP 100 right now since it has over 51% support. The reason miners can't and won't do that? Without the network full nodes supporting it, the BIP 100 blocks will be judged invalid and they will lose their block reward. In a very large way their huge incentives depend on full nodes checking their work, even if all their mining fellows are in agreement.

Without an educated and active electorate and solid checks on power there really isn't too much difference between a representative and a despotic government.

Shapeshift anonymization is for suckers, especially if you are sending a large amount to some other person. Remember that the total graph of Bitcoin is public.
Let's say that I'm an observer and I see 210 bitcoins separate into groups of 4, all through shapeshift. I can now potentially tap shapeshift or shapeshift's ISP and get their fingerprint of the client.
OK now the separated group of 4 Bitcoins are all floating around in the darkness of whatever other coin you put it in, and if you used that other coin wrong or that other network has a privacy problem that hasn't been vetted yet, you just gave yourself away here.
Now you want to bring your 210 coins back, so you convert back into Bitcoin, well I can see the transactions coming through shapeshift now, it doesn't take genius analysis to figure out that 210 coins in groups of 4 that went in are probably related to the 210 coins in groups of 4 that are coming out
Now you are sending your coins to the other guy. If you combine the coins it's now more obvious that the 210 split up before are the same as the 210 combined now. Oh 210 coins split up yesterday and now 210 coins were joined together today, I wonder what happened?
Maybe you don't combine the coins and you ask this other guy to accept many small inputs. But now you're at the mercy of his security, maybe he is dumb and deposits them all at coinbase. OK well you are screwed now because coinbase reports 210 coin deposited to the government and now you are linked to those coins through your buddy.
The more steps you go through, the more chance that one of those steps will be compromised or finger printing you somehow. For privacy, you should try to keep things as simple and as hands off as possible, and try to blend in with the crowd by doing the most normal things possible. And since all of this data is out there, forever, you have to hope that some data analysis program won't be able to run a stochastic analysis and put 2 and 2 together.

1. Scammers are prevalent on localbitcoins, their escrow service can protect you but only if you are sending fiat, not receiving

3. Only crypto transfers are non-reversible, but avoid PayPal and credit cards in particular because they are extremely reversible

If we can't come to consensus now more than in the future, what's the point of doing it now rather than in the future? 
In fact I believe consensus could be reached more easily in the future when the facts are more in evidence rather than theoretical
If the supply of tx is exhausted, and the demand is pushing the price up, there are more options than simply increasing the supply. Offchain trusted and trustless transactions are possible. People spending more judiciously is possible. Many solutions are possible. That's why I reject the narrative that the block size must grow or Bitcoin will explode

The problem with using Bitcoin for fiat to fiat is that while it works, it creates an imbalance for the traders involved and it basically just passes the same problem onto someone else.

Doesn't the fact that it is a many year debate give you some clue as to who is correct in saying it's not the most imminent problem and who is jumping the gun
How many years do we have to hear that this is an urgent problem that needs a hard fork right away, to let miners increase their block size when most pools don't even max their block size to the existing limit. Why should they, blocks aren't anywhere near full
Blockstream has only made countless commits and improvements, from high level features like pruning to low level features like fixing the efficiency of processing tx. You know, the things that are actually required to raise the block size without introducing instability into the network

One side is cavalierly rallying people to do something destructive to the Bitcoin community and that is to create a contentious fork that may very well make using Bitcoin in practice harder for almost every user of Bitcoin. If you have an SPV wallet, it may break and show you an incorrect balance. If you are a merchant, customers may start sending you the wrong coin.

My point is that calling it BIP 101 compatible makes it sound like they are ready for BIP and not just in favor of it. I think signaling without being ready is a bad idea, given that we just had an accidental hard fork because of that
Slush as a pool is not signaling very strong support of BIP 101, since they haven't changed their software, they require hash power to specifically opt in to vote for it, and they don't make big blocks.
There are no other major pools that support BIP 101 really, but there are three months left for them to change their mind?

The whole debate reminds me of alt-coins where people are claiming that Bitcoin is just the v1 and some other versions will be much better because they solve this flaw or that flaw.
Bitcoin has other characteristics than transactions per second or what hash algorithm or confirmation time were chosen. It has universality: the most number of merchants. It has history: a Bitcoin 5 years ago is still a valid Bitcoin today. It has great dev contributions on a constant basis delivering major improvements every six months. It has stability: no cult of personality or ddos attack or bankruptcy has ever given the network true pause, it has stood firm while all else fell around it. Those aren't software features, but they are insanely important features for electronic cash none the less.
If those hard won characteristics are to be risked, there better be a rock solid and obvious reason, and every alternative avenue that does not risk them should be explored first. If Bitcoin switches to new-coke, there may be no going back to coke classic

Then some people have bitcoins because they value having them more than the market price. Maybe you just want to have 1 Bitcoin to say you have one, or you have a reserve pool for spending like a checking account. Maybe you just are trying to support the movement or you like seeing a high balance in your wallet

I think the idea is to limit the reach of political power, not stop money from buying power
The idea of Bitcoin is to take away some of government's most powerful tools: inflation and control of money
It's still a major change, the idea that anyone can spend money with anyone and anyone can keep money that no one can take is a radical concept that never existed before

The network can't survive if it's impossible to communicate digitally, or otherwise within a time frame longer than minutes. Sidechains could be made to work though for longer time frames
The coins themselves are stored in a massively redundant way, the network could go down for a while and then be reinstated later without issue.
Recovery from a massive event could also be slow due to hash difficulty adjustment lag, or a major crash in the price since that is what pays for mining electricity

@_date: 2015-09-03 15:20:42
There should be no expectation of next block confirmation. It's not part of the design and it's ridiculous to expect because blocks appear after random times and in random numbers. 4 hours is a more reasonable expectation time for a confirmation, not 10 minutes. And before you think what, 4 hours that's crazy talk, 2 hours between blocks happens pretty frequently, even 3 hours is possible. So just by pure randomness alone you may easily not get confirmed very quickly, so you shouldn't expect to.
Fee attacks are not worthwhile when there is a healthy wallet ecosystem that has fees that adapt and put the attacker in a bidding war with the entire collective user base. The reference client implemented flexible fees, that's part of why the default fee was dropped from $0.10 to $0.02. If the other wallets would make progress on this and miners would do their part to find and deprioritize spam, and users would not have the false expectation of regular 10 minute confirmations, the simple attack you suggest would be useless.

So you think that there is no point in limiting what happens on chain. That would truly be wonderful if true, we could get rid of the world's databases and just store everything encrypted on the blockchain. I'd love to back up all my movies and photos and even program on top of a database that could never go down or lose data. One thing though, that's not possible because storing data on the blockchain has a real non-zero cost, and someone has to pay that
The exact person I was responding to is a person who wants to raise the limit and doesn't want to see an off chain solution.
Indeed what could be a more mature line of argument than to call others "immature"

4 years is a long time, especially for an ASIC miner whose equipment will become obsolete. 25% sized block rewards in 4 years will still be big in comparison to what fees look like today
The miners don't care about fees very much because they make over 100x in block rewards. Next year that will be 50x, still a lot. And the same for 4 years. And the longer time goes on, the harder it is to have a real idea of what will happen. Even when it's 25x, that's still a high multiplier, even 12.5x and 6x to be honest

You've just switched topics, before it was slow or stuck and now it's people reducing their usage, which is a separate question entirely.
Reduced usage is desired design: if there is a limited amount that the shared resource can be used, naturally the shared resource should be used for the highest value things first?
Users using other solutions, including altcoins, is in fact a desirable outcome. The reason this is desirable is just very very simple math: there are billions of people on the planet, the network configuration of the Blockchain is for every single person to broadcast to every other single person. I think you can imagine how much communication everyone on the planet communicating everything to everyone else would generate. That's why we need other avenues for communicating money other than the Blockchain. It cannot be all things to all people, because math.

The genie is out of the bottle and can't be put back in, but it's impossible to know what will happen specifically. 
So the concept should stick around, but mainstream appeal if it happens will take a long time. Mainstream adoption is a political problem and politics move slowly. 
I think being successful is more dangerous to Bitcoin than staying in small niches. If people see there is a real non-speculative demand for Bitcoin that is not absolutely tied to it being decentralized, they will move to create centralized competition that benefits them and that people want because they don't value decentralization and they just want easy to use, low fee worldwide electronic money. To some degree we're already seeing that today but more real usage will just make that problem worse and worse

Speculation doesn't go down just because there is real usage.
Dynamic fee calculation can raise to $.20 when needed and lower to $0.02 when needed. Users can even choose to send $0.20 as a fee if they want right now just by adjusting their wallets. There's no good reason to if the wallet is already programmed to tell you what fee will suffice as the reference client is already and a growing number of other clients are
Before Nixon there was a slow but growing fudging of the relation between gold and fiat that was established at the beginning of the U.S. Dollar hundreds of years ago. The beginning of the U.S. it was the fashion to have limited government power, that's fallen a bit out of fashion as the U.S. system has evolved. The system of paper money backed by limited commodity stretches back very far, to a Chinese emperor who issued silver promises on paper
Fiat is just one solution to a problem that Bitcoin solves another way. Bitcoin is a more individual freedom favoring solution because fiat depends on the government being benevolent and uncorrupt at all times.

It's difficult to address a lunatic fringe, the only good news is that Bitcoin is formulated in such a way that it is designed to be resistant to political machinations of corrupt central parties like Roger Ver who seek to abuse their power to alter the definition of money for their personal gain at the expense of the general public.
For Core to comprehensively address this threat, they might have to start betraying their principles, like the principle that they will be decentralized and not act in unison or have command and control style decision making. 
They'd also have to work on technical solutions dedicated to stop Bitcoiners from sabotaging Bitcoin from the inside, which is a depressing thought and not as attractive to work on as new solutions for new cool ways to use Bitcoin in the future. 
Still I agree with you that it would be nice if they could more comprehensively shut down the threat of the lunatic fringe by closing the vulnerable holes in the system that those guys want to exploit for force their changes and power grabs through.

Bitcoin could never beat the competition on fees as long as it is competing with an inflationary adversary. Remember that fees for many consumers are not just zero, they are negative: cash back, etc. Of course that is an illusion, but you can see for many people it is just as good as reality for them.
I'd love it if Bitcoin could print free money to compete better, but money doesn't come for free, even if the whiners who want bigger blocks to pay less fees think that they can get a free lunch just by complaining loudly enough.

Bitcoin is not an organization
Who is the CEO of email? Of TCP/IP? Ideally Bitcoin will become a stable standard layer that people can use to do great things on top of. Having a leader who will push Bitcoin core to do lots of things by itself and force the use of a monolithic codebase does get the advantage of having an all in one integrated and packaged solution, but it has the corresponding disadvantage of being potentially mismanaged and broken
Also given how the U.S. Government has hunted down and prosecuted all attempts to make a digital currency over the past 20+ years no matter what citizen of what country attempted it, I'm not surprised only crazy people really want to be seen as being in charge of Bitcoin and that Satoshi carefully planned his anonymity from the very start

You could have used a proper wallet like Electrum that used dynamic fees and offered the functionality of increasing fees for stuck transactions
There's no one mempool and transactions never need to time out: it's just common that they do based on common settings. 
Some people might want to use this for a legit purpose like sending a transaction with a low fee that they don't care if it doesn't get confirmed for a week
@_date: 2016-10-22 00:59:36
That's a great point, although it only applies to non guessable types of SegWit wrapped in P2SH (since the other type has no address format yet, it's unlikely to be common for a while) and there is a vulnerable time before your transactions are in a block, but that's far less impactful that op suggested.

I'm not sure what is the right way to model things having money
I think the obvious examples are your electricity or water meter
I'm thinking your electricity meter has an address that represents its unspent balance. The address's private key is actually in the wallet of your utility company, they spend out of it as needed to bill you for electricity
If the electricity address starts running low, you get a notification from your wallet asking you to confirm you want to automatically top up that address
If you install a solar power cell that feeds into the grid, it works in reverse, when the utility company draws power out of the cell, it sends compensation to the cell. Your cell's address is actually a private key in your wallet
Things wouldn't have wallets then, only people would really have wallets, but you could automate things in your wallet if you wanted to (automatically forward solar cell earnings address to electricity meter address)

Another thing to think about is how when you use the financial system, who are you supporting with the high fees, who is benefiting from inflation?
That money is going to pay for expensive cocaine parties held by rich bankers who are sitting on a perfectly captured market. After the banks went bust? Record bonuses, millions of dollars given out to bank execs. Who went to jail? No one. Where did the money come from for their house in Connecticut? From average people who just want to buy and sell thing with each other and have to pay a tax to the banks every time they do, or even when they don't spend and just sit in cash. Don't want to sit in cash? Ok but the only game in town is the bank again.

You are very wrong
- The fact that they allowed weak private keys means they had very bad practices in place and there is no way to know if those practices have changed.
- If someone slips in bad code, encryption won't help you: it's the code that does the encryption.
- Even if your private key is not seen, bc.i keeps an encrypted copy of your private key. If the encrypted copy can be brute forced: you will lose your money. This has happened to people on bc.i before!
- Keylogging malware can also potentially see GUI keyboards, that's not a foolproof method of stopping logging attacks

They want the most money, if you give people too many options they sometimes can't deal with it. They don't care about promoting the use of Bitcoin so that's why it's at the kiddie table with all the other lesser used online payments

I can't parse what you wrote, in Lightning you use Bitcoin payment channels to make small fast transactions and occasionally settle up with the Blockchain
That's of course framing things as if Lightning or 8GB Blocks are the only solutions to the problem, of course there are many solutions.
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:32:56
1. SegWit can be fully used now on testnet
2. Blocks are only 80% full and fees are around $0.05, I'm still successfully sending low priority transactions for $0.01
3. The way Bitcoin is coded, you cannot adjust the limit easily and maintain backwards compatibility. 
4. Coding cautiously is appropriate for something where mistakes are very difficult to correct and could seriously damage people's livelihoods.
5. If you are facing exponential growth, you don't double down on solutions you know for sure can't scale to service exponential usage. 
Everyone sharing all data with everyone else hits a limit exponentially quickly. With 100 participants the cost is 10,000 : 100x100. But with 1000 participants the cost is 1,000,000 : not a 10x increase but a 100x increase. That's math
So you start to dramatically increase the cost to peers to participate in the network. But peers participating in the network is the point of peer to peer currency. That is a reason for trying to keep peer costs down, to preserve the peer to peer nature of the currency. The goal is making a currency without middlemen, not making a currency with the cheapest transaction fees or a currency where scaling technology improvements are promised at any cost just to pump the price to suckers. 
3D game developers don't just rely on hardware getting better, they also improve their software. You need both software and hardware developers to improve technology.

Btw with a trezor you are still at risk of bad code, but it's much less because the trezor code is open source and has been vetted, and it's not able to get random updates that could be malicious
However trezor allows multisig mode: you can combine it with another wallet. That means both wallets would have to be simultaneously compromised for you to lose money: much less risk of loss

Services that only accept one block are already playing with fire: instead of waiting for SegWit, just mine 3 blocks right now; reveal one to the network with your theft transactions and then reveal the other two blocks that reorganize the first block out of the chain, invalidate your theft transactions as double spends and give you back your money.
If you are a merchant you can and probably already do fight script version mismatch attacks by just looking at transaction scripts being used to spend money. If the transaction script is one that is weird and not in the white list of normal transactions: wait for more confirmations before accepting it as non reversible payment.

I don't just mean market cap, I mean lots of things about Bitcoin are still new and developing, there's still a lot to improve.
If it were the reserve currency of a country, if it were a small country you might not get the exchange value adjusting enough. In that case I think it would be better if they only used it to a degree, or formed a federation of countries that all used it. 
I think it will get there but governments don't adapt new technology all that quickly even at the best of times.

Since fiat is inflationary, it will always have lower fees than Bitcoin since the people helping you move it can just make money on the float without trying hard. Many payment networks pay you for using them, Bitcoin can't do that.

Everyone can be on their own real side that is real to them. That's not elitism, its voluntarism. A hard fork doesn't require any majority, even a single person can do it.

It could be set up that way but that would be against the design goal, similar to how BitPay is a centralized payment processor for the Blockchain and miners are centralized validators for SPV clients even though Bitcoin's design tries to avoid centralization as a potential threat to its existence/usefulness. 
So there probably will be some centralization in LN and there would have to be efforts made by normal people to participate in the network if we want normal people to be the ones running it, which is what decentralization / peer to peer means.

Easily solved: just don't publish the block if you haven't verified the previous one it points to?


Same goes for a hard fork to try and force people to switch to Roger Ver-coin. He can try but will people follow? Unknown


Since blocks are still not full, what's the use of increasing a limit that is still not reached?


There's no timeline because it's not up to developers it's up to users: it's on testnet today if you want to try it.


These seem buggy and obsolete when compared with what they are trying to replace. Why downgrade to technology that is slower and less well tested?


Sure it does, nodes don't just tell miners or their destination about transactions, they also tell every other node. It's like if you had a google drive space, but you had to share it with everyone else on earth. Well you'd run out of space pretty quick right?

We could start to look at upgrading to SHA3, but that could be pretty disruptive.

The current recommendation from Core developer team is to set blocks at 750kb, but it's largely ignored by miners (following that recommendation could cost them like $20k/day in revenue)
There are issues in Bitcoin that become exponentially worse as the blocksize grows, so something that is like 3 bad at 1mb doesn't become 6 bad at 2mb it becomes 9 bad.
Increasing to 2mb is widely viewed as achievable, even though it's a very big, 100% increase, even 4mb and 8mb are seen as possible by many down the road, however it's probably a good idea that the issues are dealt with along with the raise in block size. It depends on your goals, if you are happy to risk things being broken, you might choose to ignore these major problems.

You just said a way that it will ever be above 80%: get miners to stop attacking the network with empty blocks. Some miners never mine an empty block.


Is that what you think? So miners can just print new coins for themselves and if it has the most work then it is valid? That sounds like a buggy system to me, that's not how Bitcoin Core works.


You seem pretty angry at Satoshi Nakamoto for implementing this limit, why do you want to use his coin if you feel that way about him?


Since I can still send a transaction for $0.01 and the highest effective fees are around $0.05, it doesn't seem too damaging to me. What seems damaging is shouting loudly at people for excercising their right to think differently than you.


Bitcoin Core does have plans to keep up with technology, there's a 100% transaction capacity increase planned. That's a pretty big increase.


Their solution is changing a single number and doing no other development. None of the many active core developers feel that is a good idea. And if you look the people crying and not doing are not the developers. They are writing code and releasing new versions. It's the other guys who are whining on repeat.

Peer to peer mining can be improved but only after the mining equipment race is over. Right now there's too much advantage for manufacturers to mine on their own equipment so the whole picture is distorted but when mining equipment becomes more commoditized that situation will change. Pools are slowing things down and creating a big centralization risk, it would be great to try and fix this situation instead of just giving up

Maybe you are thinking about this wrong from the start? Miners don't decide hard forks, once they get the exchanges and people to accept a soft fork, they can't logically go back, it's not mathematically possible.
They can't just win through more hash power. Their blocks attempting to steal will be worthless because they just screwed themselves by getting people to no longer value them.

No protocol rules were changed, this isn't even on by default.

You could replace every time you said "RBF payments" with "zero fee payments"
I'm not sure RBF should be part of any standard user flow at the moment though, what's the point of it? If dynamic fee assignment is implemented all RBF can do at the moment is to save a few pennies. 
I see RBF as part of improving the "super low fee" experience. Currently some users deem their transactions so unimportant they want to use zero fee or an insignificant fee. RBF can help here, currently we have to tell these people: "Wait 48 hours for it to leave the mempool and btw make sure to spend the same inputs or you might accidentally lose funds".
I'd say a future wallet should give you three choices:
1. Super minimal fee that tries to do a zero or tiny fee that might get stuck but can be automatically fixed with RBF (this one would have RBF on)
2. Default fee that uses dynamic fee assignment but does not seek to get in the next block, rather shoots for the next six blocks
3. Priority fee that uses dynamic fee assignment to try and get in the next one or two blocks. 
I do like your idea of URI hinting about the suggested priority or transaction purpose. A merchant could suggest to a client that they should use a default or priority fee.

I think Ripple came close, "proof of stake" currencies and the Elements Alpha sidechain federated model are also approaching the problem this way: hide or just ignore the fact that they are not decentralized, provide a similar use model to Bitcoin.
To be clear I don't think anyone has come up with a compelling alternative yet, but the difference between being decentralized and not decentralized can appear slight to the uninformed or uncaring user
Imagine if Apple, Microsoft and Google came together to work on a digital currency, tied to the US dollar and very easily and cheaply exchanged with support built in every App, with an easy to use system so that other companies and startups could integrate it as well. There were even some easy gateways to exchange Bitcoins for this currency, just hand over your ID and pay a small fee.
Of course the die hards of Bitcoin would never accept this, but it would make the "mainstream" appeal much harder because Bitcoin's only real advantage in the face of direct competition will be that it is decentralized. 
Look at bitcoin.org, the selling points used are: "fast", "worldwide", "low fees". Those points are not a very high bar to reach for a centralized alternative, and that centralized alternative can then profit from their position without becoming all that uncompetitive with Bitcoin on a purely feature to feature basis.

It's quite unlikely to happen, there are many checks on the code, many people watching.
Updates also generally take a while to roll out, the problem would have to be on a long delay to get everyone. A lot of Bitcoins are stored in cold storage / multisig setups so they would probably be safe from loss.
In the most dire of dire circumstances, the network could be reset or rolled back to a known safe point and people might just have to live with that.

Yes, look at the first reply from the first person who looked at Bitcoin on the mailing list, we were always screwed if screwed means that not all transactions can go on the Blockchain. However there are many solutions that can and are being implemented 
@_date: 2016-10-22 21:18:20
The Bitcoin network is not really a network for sending money, it's only a network for sending messages about money, the actual sending happens in the small blocks that are made by a small group and everyone agrees that this small database is the record they agree on.
Lightning is a network for sending money, you send to someone who sends to someone who sends to someone else. It actually doesn't need to be only used with Bitcoin, but it needs some reliable backing ledger database with certain characteristics like the Blockchain to work. Because people don't need to agree on all the data, the total database size of transactions can be huge, you just store your own data and not everyone else's as well like you do with Bitcoin.
So when you send out a transaction on Bitcoin you are sending a message about your transaction and hoping it gets passed along by people to the miners who will include it in the global ledger, the Blockchain. They aren't passing your money, just your message.
When you send out a transaction on Lightning you are sending your actual money and hoping it gets passed along to your target destination. It's more like a distributed network because instead of looking like everyone sending to a small number of miners, it's a mesh of people sending to each other.
In both networks, intermediaries generally speaking cannot steal your money, but they can do limited things to annoy you. 
Both networks have extreme failure situations where the system itself could break down and people could lose money, Bitcoin is more secure against these situations when compared against Bitcoin backed Lightning but both should be fairly secure.

Well that's for a future conference and a future time, at this moment the need to stay cohesive and build on the existing community outweighs any desires to change the blocksize rules. The proof is in the fact that people are still using the blockchain, there are no devs working on alternative clients, and the one alternative block client that has been made has stalled in full node and mining support. I'm sure this isn't over but at this moment there is pretty much full consensus that the current blocksize is sufficient.

You you don't seem to actually send transactions. If you actually look at the blocks, there is never any point where it costs more than pennies to send a normal transaction IN THE NEXT BLOCK.

It could be added to Bitcoin but their private transactions are more than ten times bigger and no one has any idea how to avoid the "trusted ceremony" because the seed value is so crucial to the entire concept of snarks. Also creating even simple snarks takes tons of resources, it requires gigs of memory and minutes even on a high end machine running native code.

XT never had any real support to begin with. If you look over all of the commits in that repo, there isn't a single one from anyone who ever added a single line of code to Bitcoin core, except Mike and Gavin.
There have been clients that try to mimic the network propagation detection work done by the merchant processors, but they are not as robust and can be fooled.
The cost of a transaction is not just borne by the miner, it's also borne by every full node. There's no way to measure the cost there because each full node lives in a different environment. Therefore fees cannot be modeled on their cost since it is unknown

I appreciate the freedom of Bitcoin. A lot of people don't understand how freedom works, they think it is just "oh I was stopped from saying something, now I need free speech".

Even if you made a very easy to use, runs on every phone version of Bitcoin, you'd still have big problems beating 85,000 exchange agents, being accepted by everyone, and being pegged to the shilling since those are either impossible or just a manifestation of a successful network effect.
To beat established network effects you can't just go head to head on features. Bitcoin needs to offer compelling differences and use those as a beachhead to build out from there. Just like MPesa isn't a new form of paper currency, Bitcoin can't just be a clone of MPesa.
Bitcoin's key selling point has to be based on its Internet nature, its decentralized nature and its philosophy, those are the key differentiators as far as Bitcoin as a product goes. 
1. We need more global services and marketplaces where citizens of Kenya need to get Bitcoin to access them (where Joe Kenyan can sell tea online to overseas buyers, ala AliExpress)
2. We need more work on making the plumbing of Bitcoin decentralized (most of the tools to make Bitcoin actually work in practice are not well localized, most open source tools made for Bitcoin are geared towards users in the first world)

RBF is either used or not, there's no in-between state where there is both an RBF coin and another coin. Since there aren't two coins, there's no reason to consider either of them "not bitcoin". Any consensus rule change would create some "not bitcoin" coin and therefore off-topic unless you accept the idea that all coins with the same genesis block are the same coin, which is nonsense.

I think the numbers show that to get out of pennies per tx territory we would need millions of new users. It's simple math: right now a tx is three pennies. We can grow by three times and still be pennies. How fast do you think triple user growth is happening? Take a look at how subscriber growth in this subreddit is going and tell me when you expect Bitcoin subreddit will reach 350k subscribers. It will take a while
And yes it may never happen. There's no way of knowing if we hit the peak, that's something only apparent in retrospect. But I think it's definitely possible. And even if it is not the peak, we could be on the cusp of some new tech that changes everything and we have no idea what it is. The point is that the future is uncertain, farther out: even less certain.
Yes hash reward is denominated in BTC and so are fees, but that's where their relationship ends. There's no deterministic link there, and hash rate always compensates up or down to total rewards. So rewards going down means nothing for fees other than they look good in comparison. There's still a lot of reward left: billions of dollars worth, there's no reason to worry about rewards running out for at least a decade if the current prices hold up at all. It's definitely to early to say that pennies need to be turned into the replacement for billions right away

The solution is to avoid storing wealth in Bitcoin or fiat or precious metals, except as a hedge against the risk of normal assets becoming devalued or over-valued
Where should you store wealth? Your education, your home, loans to trusted people, your career, bonds, stocks, things that have "earning potential". 
Bitcoin is not a replacement for all asset types, it's a replacement for fiat currency
Don't bother speculating if this or that currency will take over in the future, the answer is 99.9% they won't. Even Bitcoin should be purchased only for its utility: it is not a way to "get rich". The market is not stupid, it's pricing it at a rate which is commensurate with its chances of success and future demand

What you said sounds relatively OK, except do not ever send to Coinbase if you want to avoid being tracked, they track very aggressively.

Fees are charged per byte so it depends on the complexity of your transaction. A large multisig transaction is more expensive than a small normal transaction. If you are using Electrum you can just use RBF though, put a fee you like and then toggle RBF. If it takes too long you can increase the fee later to speed it up.

Only miners solve math problems, that were arbitrarily selected to be slow to solve but fast to verify.
The reason math problems are required is because Bitcoin is a single record of transaction history and the math problem provides a way to stop random people from editing the record.
Only people who commit serious resources can edit the transaction history record and they prove their commitment through the solving of the problems.
Because the miners who solve the problems have spent a lot of money to solve them, they are incentivized to not do bad things, and based on that, you can trust their additions to the transaction record.

This reveals the thinking of people who don't hold Bitcoin. If Bitcoin were to spike 10x or 20x in popularity, anyone who held Bitcoin would be so ecstatic about their holdings increasing in value they wouldn't give a crap about some small fee increases. If you're paying $1/month in fees now, if your fees go up to $5/month but your holdings are now 10x as valuable, you're not going to be losing any sleep over it.
As for new entrants to the Bitcoin market, they would have no reference point for how much Bitcoin transactions would cost and thus wouldn't mind paying an increased fee.
And as for the market itself, the increased fees would serve as a huge incentive to provide alternatives or more efficiencies in transactions, leading to lowering costs anyway.

Most Bitcoin holders value the coin higher than the current prices, supply of coins at the "price" is constricted to a small minority of owners who value it lower or are seeking to profit from market churn. 
Some new buyers started buying in China, buying more than the available supply, pushing the price up. Seeing the price go up day after day, people started to front run the price to try and make money (if I offered to sell a winning lotto ticket that paid off in one month, you wouldn't get much discount). This started a self reinforcing cycle: a bubble. People realized this, didn't want to lose money, and eventually the bubble popped. Back to normal

Imagine we can make peer to peer mining take over, that will solve problems related to centralization of mining (meaning confirmations are faster because it's harder for a single individual to control multiple confirmations). We have p2pool now, but it's not popular enough yet because of drawbacks and existing incentives in favor of pooled mining.
OK the way for peer to peer mining to be decentralized and work is for each individual peer miner to run a full node. Imagine you are a big centralized pool with a lot of resources and small peers are starting to steal hash rate from you. You are strongly incentivized to make small miners have to join a pool (potentially your own) by making it significantly more expensive to receive and verify a block. A big miner or pool also gets an advantage by getting to collect more fees if they can quickly upload a huge block. This hurts decentralization of miners, which actually slows the entire payment system down (imagine we only had 2 pools, you might not trust the blocks for a lot of confirmations since either one of the pools could be playing dirty pool and making tons of bad blocks)

The network only processes about 1.8 tps at the moment, generating about $0.10 in fees per second. The block reward is meant as a bootstrapping mechanism to create the network and will fall away.

If he did (he didn't) then he forgot to code that up or say how it should be done. Bitcoin code has a limited number of transactions that can be sent in a given time period. I'm not sure if you've taken a math class yet, but zero times any number is still zero. That means if you send a million transactions, there is no additional fee to send a million more. And a million transactions is more than the number allowed by the Bitcoin codebase in a block. So there you go: unlimited free transactions are not possible because they are limited by the space in a block.

This means that there could be two forks of history going forward, so coins on fork A might not make sense to fork B and therefore there could be two bitcoins: bitcoinOriginal and bitcoin101.
The previous history would be preserved in bitcoin101, so if you never did anything you would be fine on both versions, but if you started moving your coins, you could now have two different transaction histories

One strategy is evaluating the correct "value" for Bitcoin on your own. 
A very simplified thought process might look like: "Bitcoin will end up having 10 million worldwide active users and each of those users will want to hold an average of $1,000 worth of Bitcoin, so that demand will justify a $500 price". At that point you could set up a couple of ranges, like if it's under $250 you will buy what you can, if it's $250-750 you will not buy or sell, if it's $750-1000 you will start selling, if it's $1000 and above you will sell strongly
You got the answer yourself though, it's random. The point of the market itself is for all involved to find the correct price, so the price you see is the actual best estimate that anyone can come up with.

Bitcoin and low value transfer coins can be used separately.  Users shouldn't have to download all of both to use one or the other.  Low value coin users may not want to download everything the next several unrelated networks decide to pile in either.
These networks need to have separate fates.  Low value coin users might be completely liberal about adding any large data features since relatively few full nodes are needed to provide security and decentralization, while Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it's easy for lots of users and small devices.

Your post sounds insulting even though you qualified it, like saying "not being racist but $anything"
Bitcoin will attract more talent as it grows, but it does already have very qualified developers and other experts at various levels working on it. As far as credentials go, this is software: the biggest companies in the space were formed by college dropouts and the developers' work can speak for itself. The current crop of Bitcoin devs are pretty good, their work protects Billions of dollars worth of value and has held up steadily under ongoing attacks and scrutiny at academic levels. 
One thing that would make a big difference would be to legalize Bitcoin very discretely, that is to say: exempt it from the various legal red tape that makes fiat such a pain to work with. Not likely to happen, but that would lower a systemic risk of Bitcoin and induce more experts to risk their time and effort to make Bitcoin a better solution for people. 
Or simple growth would also reduce the risks and attract more investment and talent.

I'm saying that before "Blockstream" as a company or a concept existed, the public positions of the developers in question were the same. So basically the theory that they switched to their positions because of Blockstream doesn't track logically because Blockstream came after their positions.
You have the timing wrong on Lightning Network too. It's not possible for them to have been pushed into this position due to Lightning Network because that came well after their public positions. And they didn't even come up with the idea, it was someone else, who they later hired.
From an "interest" standpoint: Blockstream is making products for Bitcoin. Bitcoin sidechains that will only be useful with the context of Bitcoin main chain being the dominant and most secure and widely used chain. Otherwise sidechains are pretty useless. They are making Lightning Network for Bitcoin: something that will only be useful if Bitcoin is widely used for transactions. So where is their interest? In making people in the world have as many Bitcoin transactions as possible. How can you spin that as a negative interest?
Everything that Blockstream is making is Open Source. If they make a private transaction system or a transaction network system, anyone can take that code and make it their own. So if they make Lightning collect fees, someone else can run that and charge less fees, or no fees. If they make a private transaction system, someone else can fold it into an altcoin or even into Bitcoin itself, the code is out there.
It seems like you feel there is some other Bitcoin dev team waiting on the sidelines, just ready to be given a chance. The commits lay the facts bare. Every single dev who wants to make Bitcoin better wants to do it in the main chain and avoid a contentious fork:  - The only devs who want to split in a contentious civil war are not devs who are even working on anything at all: BEHOLD ZERO COMMITS:  - look through those commits btw, not a single dev who has even contributed to bitcoin-core has ever made any commit on bitcoinxt except our usual suspects: Gavin and Mike. Gavin BTW who is busy working with the "blockchain alliance" to meet with the Department of Justice, how is that for a conflict of interest? Maybe there are parties interested in the blockchain being less decentralized, did you ever think about that? No one is more suspicious of someone else committing a crime than a criminal who is doing it himself.
I can't think of a single dev working on Bitcoin who hasn't said publicly that increasing the blocksize using a hard fork is not an option, and is not a potentially good option. The only thing they agree on is that it must be done in an obvious way and that it is only one of multiple solutions to the problem of throughput, because of serious tradeoffs that must be considered. No actual active devs are saying: "fork the chain, there can be no negative effects, only positive effects"

Cripple segments of the user base is just idiocy: there's no reason not to use dynamic fees. It's now in many clients including the reference client.

Speculation is really just that, no one knows. Everyone claiming it was capital controls, ponzi schemes, etc, where are they now, saying they were wrong or something changed?
The fact is that in a small market it takes very little to make a big movement, up or down. Even a single wealthy person could have moved the entire market and not said anything as far as we know.
In my made up theory the crash seems to have been because people were trying to run in front of some big buyers, buying up coins and withdrawing supply to lure the big buyers into spending more money. That seemed to be working and maybe feeding upon itself, but that's not a sustainable pattern if the big buyers don't cooperate and keep buying.

If there's a hard fork that is contentious there will be two coins, bitcoinA and bitcoinB
Exchanges will either have to support both and separate them out or pick one. It could get confusing because the addresses will look the same, you might send them the wrong coin and they would have to send it back. Or you might deposit coinA and they would credit you with coinB for withdrawal 
If a hard fork is not contentious an exchange would just pick the fork that everyone is going with and not support the other one at all.

Blocks being full is not a problem in and of itself. The fullness of blocks may present problems to users who want to do things like send zero fee transactions, but those type of problems could potentially be solved while leaving the blocks full forever.


Increasing fees is helpful, because it prioritizes high value transactions. A transaction is not an individual person, one person can easily spam the network with millions of low fee transactions. This is a very old problem on the network, and a big problem for any decentralized system.
Think about zero fee transactions. We learned early on that supporting infinite numbers of zero fee transactions was mathematically impossible. So, how to decide which transactions go through? Fees.


If someone wants blocks to become full, it's not hard to make that happen, just buy up all the cheap inventory at the bottom of the fee market. If we reward that bad behavior, we are hurting the network by increasing the cost on node operators.


Plans like this don't work because in consensus decision making. It's impossible to make a forward looking plan like that, people could just not do that when the time came to do it.


This issue has been long long anticipated. Imagine a room where to talk to someone you have to tell everyone in the room what you are saying. When there is a small number of people in the room, no problem. As more people enter, it starts to get bad. Then you need to splinter into small groups or other forms of communication. This is what we have in Bitcoin today, a broadcast system where everyone shouts every transaction at everyone else. It works up to a point, but it's totally stupid to try and make it keep working forever. 
We can already see that there isn't much headroom for growth in the shouting model, as you say, maybe a small constant at most. So before we waste that safety margin on a dumb plan like just keep kicking the can down the road and procrastinating the real solutions that everyone knows we need eventually, we should first not be lazy and make sure we gave the near term smart compromise options like SegWit a real chance.

You're competing with everyone else who can run a node so profits may be thin, however it involves some setup and commitment to funds so you can charge for that access. It also depends on how popular LN becomes

Miners hoarding their Bitcoin instead of spending it has a similar impact to everyone who hoards their Bitcoin instead of spending it.

Yeah blocks aren't full if they aren't filled. It's like saying a traffic jam isn't a traffic jam if there is plenty of room on the road.
If you think fees are high at $0.03 for the next block then you are comparing these fees to something that never really existed. There's never been a point in Bitcoin history where you could say, "I will send unlimited numbers of no fee transactions and have timely confirmations". There's always been a fixed limit on transactions that can be sent, and to change that fact would be to break or weaken Bitcoin.
There's never been a point in Bitcoin history where you could say "I will wait 10 minutes and definitely have a confirmation". The variance and mining logic there has been unchanged since day 1. To change that logic would be to break or weaken Bitcoin.
So essentially you are saying you want to break or weaken Bitcoin. I ask why do you even want to use something that is broken or weak?

The thing is, even if you disagree with the dev team's decisions or are suspicious of them, there is no other dev team, so the choice is the core dev guys (mostly blockstream yes) or nothing. 
The alternative team that has been put together has no warm bodies, and that's not so surprising because not many people have the luxury to work full time for free and not many people are expert enough on cryptography and the other specialized disciplines Bitcoin involves and the intersection of those groups is tiny.
A big part of why blockstream could raise ten million: they have virtually all of the small number of experts with the ability and experience in a hot field that has yielded many hundreds of millions of dollars in investments. At the very least they are a huge buyout target if any of the Bitcoin or blockchain companies make it big
The thing is about these lightning network fees you're talking about, you're just making this stuff up. According to the devs and the Open source code and the open source paper, the fees involved with lightning should be tiny. And since Lightning is still Bitcoin, they would shoot themselves in the foot if they broke the security of the network, people only want to accept Bitcoin because they think it can't be forged and screwed with. That's why it makes no sense that lightning is designed to kill miners
The thing about interests is that everyone has them, including the guys pointing out how everyone else has them. We are lucky to have Bitcoin where no developer can make us update, where every full node is equal and trusts nothing except its fundamental math, where we can choose completely voluntarily to join the monetary system that we want. The only thing that's left is making the right decision based on all the facts and not just persuasive stories made up to sway us one way or another.

It's the best of many worse options.


It's mitigated by full nodes validating the blocks, but it is bad. There is work being done to fix this situation, but right now it is not optimal.

It's definitely not anonymous, there are projects like Tumblebit, Mimblewimble, Confidential Transactions and JoinMarket underway to improve this


Society doesn't really need to agree to anything, in the grand scheme of things the "wealth" is not much


Speculation is present, but some percentage of owners are hodlers who want to hodl regardless. The coins naturally flow to them over time.


They can, but technical improvements can also counteract this

A lot of volume is done OTC. Bitcoin is certainly volatile, no doubt
Nothing you are saying sounds like something that can't be fixed or worked on. Bitcoin is certainly not perfect today, but it's progressively addressing these issues and getting better.

I think the idea is that it would work the same as Bitcoin works today, but with two differences:
1. It would ask for a much lower fee
2. You wouldn't see a "waiting for confirmation" thing anymore
As far as reputation goes, it's not really channels you should care about but "breach remedy transaction" publishers.

If you or this person catches someone trying to steal, you'll get rewarded with the thief's funds, but if there is a failure then you could lose funds.

There's already a sidechain coded to provide improved privacy of coins, my hope is this time next year it will be usable outside of test coins. Trying to blacklist evil coins will be like a nanny filter trying to blacklist porn sites: it will work against big obvious targets but any dedicated resistance will make the effort just an annoyance.

Even when blocks aren't full, there is such a thing as a "stuck transaction". There's no hard and fast rule about what miners will put into blocks, it's just guesswork. Full blocks or not full blocks, it will still be guesswork.
Zero conf doesn't really work for anything a vendor can't claw back or just take a loss on. That's why it's only used at merchants
There's never only one solution to a problem. There are tons of solutions to how to scale Bitcoin.
One way that zero conf can be hacked to be made "more reliable" is by connecting to tons of nodes to judge the relative propagation of a transaction to try and detect double spending. But that requires a lot of resources to pull off, meaning it is less decentralized
You are saying a penny is too high for a transaction cost. With near zero fees, there's virtually no cost to spam, making the network less predictable and more centralized
Did you forget that you suggested waiting for a forty minute confirmation is unacceptable? That's always been the case..
There is no proposal for a better system to know what the next block is going to look like. That would be interesting, but this proposal is not something that exists
You're burying your head in the sand saying 8mb block sizes are well tested and no problem. You're burying your head in the sand thinking that is something that any actual developer on Bitcoin wants: just go to the xt repository and see when the last developer made a commit.

It's not the miners enforcing the rules, it's the entire network of nodes enforcing rules. Just because miners activate a soft fork, doesn't mean anything if the rest of the network doesn't follow suit. That's the actual design of the network.


Voluntary is correct, except you are leaving out that you bribe Classic hashers to come to your service by awarding them hashing power that is at your disposal


Right, part of my free choice is saying that you are abusing your position by helping an attack on the network, and that miners should exercise their free choice by leaving your pool.


Not really, I do think we have a problem. The problem is that these "not care" miners are significant, and they are slowing the progress on the network and hurting the Bitcoin project. The improvements that they are stopping or slowing down: CSV, SegWit, etc. The improvements they are speeding up: nothing. Be honest with yourself: there is absolutely zero chance that Classic will even activate at this point, not without huge damage with many people splitting off, and certainly not without the big hashers switching to use it first. So all you are accomplishing is extending the problems and stopping the solutions.

Soft forks like SegWit have a minor downside which is that if you don't update, you grow out of sync with the network consensus of what is a valid chain. This isn't something you should expect to have forever anyway, but it's an emergent property of how things work in practice.
So for example, before SegWit you look at the chain and someone else looks at the chain, you probably are seeing the same validation result, if some 51% miner tries something sneaky, he will either fool everyone or fool no one. 
After SegWit, the 51% miner who tries something sneaky will get two results: if you didn't update to SegWit he can pretend SegWit never happened, from your perspective that's fine, you don't even know what SegWit is. But from the perspective of an updated person, what he's doing is a hard fork and will be automatically ignored, meaning there will be two chains.
This kind of weakens the herd protection people have by being in sync with everyone else on the rule set. However this is not a protection you should feel entitled to, it's not part of the system design and stopping it means stopping the diversity of the clients people run which is impossible and the diversity is also beneficial in other ways. This isn't something special to SegWit, the BIP 16 soft fork did the same thing, as have other soft forks, it's just a soft fork thing.

I admit that high fees is not acceptable, but letting Jihan Wu actively threaten the network, put backdoors in his software, sponsor misinformation campaigns all in order to change consensus rules is more unacceptable.

Likely LN or things like it will mainly service two uses:
1. Small transfers where the most affordable option is LN and on-chain is comparatively expensive.
2. Very common transfer paths where two or three parties are doing a lot of back and forth trading, like in arbitrage.

I know you're saying that you want there to be some kind of burst capability, but the dots aren't connected there. There's no code for that, and not even a solid reasoning laid out of how a burst would work, like how would a miner decide when to burst.
The tradeoff would be potentially higher full node cost if burst mode didn't work as intended or miners could exploit it to crowd out small miners, meaning more centralization. Also if you didn't give tons of lead time to change the block rules or the change was contentious, there'd be tons of problems related to having two chains.
The thing is, there is already a burst mode: fees. Given 10k transactions, there is going to be a range of prioritization on them. Some will be important to clear quickly, some will be not so important. Automatic fee calculation can be used with marginal differences to create a burst like capability

Probably because your change output is so small. Try doing a CPFP yourself. Select "Coins" in Electrum to see your unspent coins and then select the unconfirmed coin change output and then select some other outputs that have more money and right click and press spend. Then spend them back to yourself with RBF on and using a high fee.

The nuclear option only works if you do it just in time, so it would only work in the rare cases you a) discover the loss within a confirmation window and b) still have access to your system and the thief isn't in control
Hardware and multisig are complicated now, but there's nothing fundamentally complicated about it: confirm your transaction another way. Electrum's next version will have a really easy way to do it.

So you're worried about Bitcoin market share among blockchains? Isn't it possible that transactions will move more off-chain than other-chain? Moving to another chain might win me a dollar or two in fees, but lose me hundreds of dollars in volatility or security problems.
We already have all sorts of solutions for the blockchain's transaction rate and cost deficiencies, like ChangeTip and other internal ledger services like the Bitcoin exchanges. With the expansion of those services and decentralized versions thereof and sidechains, I think the most probable outcome is that Bitcoin remains the main unit of currency and most transactions move off-chain rather than other-chain
Even if there is a possibility that another chain wins, then so what, it won. Yes early adopters of Bitcoin are sad because they didn't get to cash out at the top, but mission accomplished as far as getting people to use a blockchain to transact with
BTW, a 1mb block might not stick around forever. It might be adjusted upwards in reaction to fee pressure. There's nothing saying that if it isn't adjusted today it can't be adjusted tomorrow.

A lot of the wealth distribution problems that we have today are due to "sweetheart deals" in the finance industry where the small number of huge banks have a revolving door in and out of the Federal Government and lobbyists who write their own industry regulations.

So why do these banks bother? Because they can get more money that way. And there's only a small number who can profit like this, so that leads to wealth inequality. Bitcoin will help there.

$250,000 in costs for a brick and mortar business for a year in Boston doesn't sound all that realistic, especially when you throw in the legal compliance costs.
Ok assume this is the real cost anyway. You charge a reasonable 5% on exchanges to Bitcoin: still annoyingly expensive for customers who can just use Coinbase or Circle but a reasonable cost for convenience. We ignore completely the costs of actually exchanging the coins yourself on an actual exchange and assume all of those are defrayed by selling Bitcoin t-shirts. To reach $250,000 then you need $5,000,000 in exchange business, which means about $14,000 a day in trade, every day of the year, or every hour of every day a customer comes in and exchanges an average of $850
That seems a bit unrealistic. The consulting services would probably also not make too much, Bitcoin is spread too thinly for there to be much profit in accepting it at a local venue.
I'm trying to think of something that would work, but brick and mortar businesses are really expensive

2FA - 2 factor authentication - the idea is that you combine your authentication with "something you have" and "something you know".
This is why they use your phone number: your phone + your password = 2 factors. Google Authenticator is another way to prove that you have your phone, and it doesn't require a phone number. 
It just stores a secret on your phone and then you use it to prove that you know the secret in a way that doesn't reveal it. This proves you have your phone, and that you have a 2nd factor of authentication.
You should enable 2FA on all your online accounts, it's much more secure.

The real issue is volatility
How can bitcoins win when their competition offers a stable (if slowly sinking) valuation?
IMO the answer is in using bitcoins as glue for abstract asset ownership
If we could develop markets for real assets that are compatible with Bitcoin, instead of holding unstable Bitcoin you could hold stable assets. This could be currency if you choose, but it could also be debt obligations or shares in companies or real estate.
In this model, volatility would be dealers choice, your wealth sits in funds, not in Bitcoin. Future wallets would then give you options for large transactions that would swap your coins for other assets on the fly
This is the real opportunity for the unbanked. Unbanked people are getting screwed because unlike the rich, they can't store value at all: they have too little to enter the mainstream system for storing wealth, even their salary is slowly cut down by inflation.

The legacy chain would need 51% to keep going, at a bare minimum. Then they would need 25% at a bare minimum for the UASF chain. So they need to sustain 76% totally dedicated hash power over time, and the best that they would do is delay transactions.
If we can see in front of our eyes that one single entity can control 76% of all hash power, even over extended hashpower brought to bear temporarily to protect the chain, and they are willing to use it to attack the chain in a way that proves the danger of any chain secured by their hashpower, and they have enough money to do it indefinitely without any worry of the massive millions of dollars in opportunity cost losses, that is very clearly a PoW change situation which would fix the issue conclusively. It would be disruptive, but if that were their goal they could be disruptive in various other ways that would be much cheaper.

Well then it's just a confusing set of terms. The idea is that you don't need to worry about anyone else's "vote". You do what you want. Other people do what they want. If those wants happen to coincide, great: work together, otherwise people go their separate ways and don't bother each other
A vote of miners is therefore totally unbinding to me. I don't have to "exit", it's the miners who are exiting by sending me blocks I will ignore.

It is implemented but there is still a lot of discussion about how to roll it out. The current proposal called UASF has been coded but the economy has to get behind it for it to work, and figuring out the specifics of the UASF that works for what people want is an ongoing process.

I came from the opposite side: I used to think Gavin was somehow being used by all these bad people and that he was one of the good guys.
Then I took a lot of time to look deeper into the history of Bitcoin and Gavin's role in it. This research completely changed my thinking - and the notable events I made bookmarks of
Gavin has adjusted his stances over time, but if Gavin were to be "leveraged", those who leveraged him selected someone who already had strong inclinations towards the positions he's later taken. I think the likeliest truth is somewhere in between: that Gavin works with agencies out of his own volition, as evidenced by his name on various Bitcoin regulatory working groups, and statements Gavin has made about the ethical basis of Bitcoin (or lack thereof, Gavin is not a cypherpunk).

It would take a lot to get the miners to act as one if there were still proportionally people willing to pay for the minority side coins. 
And if they still acted as one anyway against what people wanted, that would definitely be the time to switch PoW. 
Mining is an unfortunate compromise, it's not a feature. If we can drop mining, we should. If we can change mining to benefit users at the expense of miners, we should do that too. Making money for the miners has nothing to do with the point of Bitcoin, it's just an implementation detail. 
Miners naturally want to abuse their power, because as soon as you give someone one iota of power, it starts the clock on that power corrupting them. That screws up the currency, eventually. So we need a system where we reject people having power: where you don't let miners have power over you.

You're presenting this as if privacy is on or off
Bitcoin will never reach 100% privacy, that's basically impossible for an online system. You can be fingerprinted a million ways, like from your pattern of typing to your network links
Of course that doesn't mean it's hard to figure out who has what. Hackers of exchanges are so crap at protecting their privacy they generally plug it all into a single address, but they still evade detection
Don't confuse theoretical anti privacy with practical de-anonymizing.
The existing system is hardly anonymous: where you live and your rough net worth is information that isn't that difficult to determine, especially if you use a credit card. People with high net worths are often forced to publicly announce it to comply with government regulations

Some types of changes require full consensus of every single full node. This includes important rules like 21 million cap and block reward amounts. This is called hard forking
Other changes are not so impactful, they could cause problems but generally don't mess with anyone's existing coins or any fundamental rules. These require the miners and are called soft forks
The core devs can introduce these changes and are in a very influential position to do so. However everything is done in the open and discussed to death and takes plenty of time so the damage that a single core dev could do is pretty limited. The most damage they could do would be to stop contributing, there aren't that many core devs

It's so simple: I decide for myself. I decide there should be 21 million coins. I decide there should be 1mb per block.

This theory seems so far fetched. Why would this MMM company crash the market when they could make more selling slowly? Why did the people enter MMM all at once when it's been running for years now? Why did they stop entering MMM suddenly? Why hasn't anyone produced any real evidence of this mass Chinese MMM investment like real stats? Why is 100% of the investment going through Bitcoin when plenty of Chinese people are buying property and fancy bags and clothing around the world in fiat? Why has the restrictions become looser not tighter by the Chinese govt in recent days? Why aren't there examples of Chinese marketing of MMM being shown around: Chinese people don't have high English literacy. Why isn't the obvious answer being taken into consideration: sometimes Bitcoin has a rally and it doesn't really make sense but people get excited, just like almost any other market?

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Monero claims to be untraceable but pretty clearly if someone buys $1000 worth of Monero at Monerobase and then 10 minutes later someone spends $1000 worth of Monero at MoneroRoad, well I think I know they are the same person because basically no one ever uses Monero for anything. So the basic premise is a total lie. Why are they lying? Because they bought tons of Monero and they want it to get more expensive. Why not just improve Bitcoin's privacy? Because they didn't buy Bitcoin early enough and the developers on Monero are not competent enough to contribute. The project isn't vetted by anyone, so its other claim of being secure is also crap. The mission of Monero is to get people to buy into its bogus claims, pump up the value and then all the "investors" can take their profits and leave. Just like the thousands of other altcoins.

The key reuse isn't public like the Blockchain, it's a private signing between two parties. 
Also, Lightning is temporary, after a while the channels close, whereas the Blockchain is designed to be permanent. Even with a normal transaction on the Blockchain your signature is floating out there for a while. If someone could crack your signature in the time before a block, they could steal your money, no LN required. LN extends this period, but it also limits the audience

Bitcoin is volatile mainly because it is small, if it were huge like a major currency it would be far less volatile
Bitcoin deposits could be insured by the government if the government wanted to, that could definitely happen. Already we have some Bitcoin deposits insured by large private insurers. No government has declared Bitcoin legal tender, although that could happen. The legal status of Bitcoin is similar to barter.
That definitely gives government currencies an edge, but Bitcoin has its own advantages, especially if you are one of the billions of people who live in a country where your government does not have your best interests at heart
Bitcoin is not nonconvertible, it's the opposite of nonconvertible: there are tons of markets to convert Bitcoin to other currencies.

Coinbase is fine to buy from - but their wallet should not be used.
Unfortunately their company and employees have shown bad faith to the community, locked and banned accounts without being forthcoming about the reasons why, and they enforce arbitrary and hidden rules about how to use their service that are related to their banking partner relationships
Using their wallet you put your money at risk of being frozen or lost. You put your account at risk of being banned in a false positive, or just for an arbitrary reason. That's why I strongly recommend that you never ever use Coinbase as a wallet and limit your interactions with them to buying and selling for fiat.

Ignorance is always afraid of change - Jawaharlal Nehru
Many wallets have failed to implement proper fee calculation or user interface hinting, either deliberately or through simple lack of effort. This causes the issue, that some people are not given the opportunity to pay a proper fee. Talking about changing Bitcoin protocol to support random buggy wallet behavior is not the right way to think about the long term design of a system that is planned to last a hundred years or more.
There's absolutely zero evidence that a reasonably calculated priority fee transaction will get stuck or go slowly. And if there were, we have an obvious next step, which is using opt-in RBF to adjust fees on the fly in the case of slow or stuck transactions.

VPNs proxy your IP identity information but IP is not recorded by the Bitcoin transactions system so it's not a big help
The most private way to use Bitcoin is to use Tor and Bitcoin Core, never reuse an address and use to mix your funds with others to make it harder for people to figure out whose coins belong to whom 
A VPN only helps marginally and if they are logging or compromised it can actually hurt privacy

Tamper resistance comes 100% from mining, even with only one node. However for some super secure use cases like a big merchant, you will want a full node to avoid some very expensive but still possible attacks on lite clients. Full nodes are also good for those paranoid about privacy, you get increased privacy with a full node. Lite clients are fine for 99% of usage though, the average consumer should be able to use a lite client like bread wallet or electrum without noticing any drawbacks ever

You've misread the chart: 
This refers to the block subsidy value and not the transaction cost - which currently tops out at around $1.50 for the fastest confirmation
@_date: 2016-05-17 06:48:53


Misrepresents what I said, even though I stated in simple language even a five year old could parse. A miner can add twice as many SegWit transactions to a block, so they should naturally cost half as much.


Now I know you are willfully lying because I already explained this to you: no devs control any part of any fees. Those are 100% decided by individual miners.


Hey I saw a child molester the other day and he was ranting just like you. What an interesting coincidence two people are ranting in exactly the same way? That makes no sense, unless....


Fees promote decentralization by adding a cost to actions that would incur cost on full nodes, which are part of the decentralization of Bitcoin. So SegWit's suggested fee structure is setup to reward transactions that move their signature to a segregated area so that it no longer represents a permanent memory burden to a full node.


What's the issue then? If they are helping Bitcoin and not hurting Bitcoin, then Bitcoiners win. Why do you bother to make up lies if you don't think they are sabotaging Bitcoin? That doesn't make sense, unless... you are a sociopath?

I'd say it's in their interest, but everyone has to decide what's in their own interest themselves.
There is a credible theory that it may not be in some miner's interest to do this for reasons they are keeping secret.

There's a statute of limitations on what you say? This quote is a direct piece of evidence supporting the claim that the mechanism of decision making that Gavin espouses is not consistent with that of the Bitcoin Core group. All those who disagree with the Bitcoin Core groups decision making project and agree with Gavin have had plenty of chances to leave the group or challenge the system, none have availed themselves of that opportunity. 
Gavin's publicly stated, long held position is that a successful Bitcoin project needs a dictator or a voting based decision making system. Since this is his stated view and he has repeated it and taken strong actions to this effect, it definitely serves as a strong indicator that he would take another action that served that view: instating a person he thinks is Satoshi with an unnecessary repository access level

The same goes for the freedom of speech that Bitcoin represents, few care about that even though it's the defining aspect of Bitcoin. That's the real problem with this forum, the people who care more about the exchange rate than the actual utility of what they are exchanging or hoping to exchange

The last major Core release had 94 credited contributors, the one before that had 77.
There is no need to run what they produce, they have no special powers to force you to update or pay attention to them in any way.
Core developers themselves don't all run the same code, they even have their own individual forks they maintain.
Miners can only operate within a specific set of rules, saying they control the machinery implies they can manipulate the system.
There are only 2 things miners can do:
1. Control the ordering of transactions over time.
2. Refuse to include a transaction in a block.
They have no other powers or control. Miners are only miners because people running code use the hash power they produce, however people running code could switch to a different type of hash power simply by applying a single already written pull request.

Using BitMain's proposal to put them in charge of Bitcoin consensus rules is its death knell. This would financially benefit Voorhees, who is one of the major purveyors of altcoins.


This is totally false. BIP 9 only measures hashpower, not the users. The users are what count.
Voorhees is a guy who happily sold people scam Ponzi schemes like PayCoin. When challenged on this, his response has always been, "People should not fall for scams, it's not my fault they bought the scam from me."

The recommendation for merchants is to accept an order at 0 confirmations, but not to take it seriously until 1 confirmation and best to wait to complete the order in a way that cannot be reversed until at least 3 confirmations. For very large amounts or very low trust, 6 or more confirmations is recommended
The whole security system is based on waiting for energy to be spent in a provable way, so that you can see that if someone were to reverse the transaction they would need to spend $x amount on energy. That's your safety margin as a merchant: waiting for significant energy to be spent

One reason why is that strong anonymity with Bitcoin is not going to be very possible, because almost all use cases for spending Bitcoin involve steps that are going to easily break your anonymity, if you don't follow proper operational security which is hard to do. Darkwallet and darkcoin, coinjoin they are the same thing and are pitched as ways to be anonymous but they are just "more private". 
As an analogy: let's say you live in a city with cameras everywhere. Everyday you wear a bright orange sweater. If someone wants to track you, it's easy to look for your sweater. Coinjoin is like exchanging your sweater with some other people so one way of tracking you gets harder. If someone cares, they can still follow you from where you leave your home, from your haircut or face, etc.

People who this is happening to are using out of date, abandonware wallets. It's like the guys running Windows XP, they might prioritize their upgrade now that they've been attacked.
If there is a rebroadcasting attack then the mempool being full will actually help mitigate it. That's because low fee transactions get pushed out of the mempool when higher fee transactions are around. If there's enough higher fee transactions in the mempool there is no good way to rebroadcast low fee ones because they will not be relayed.

The part where that is relevant to the block-size or the decision to not accept bad technical decisions from non-developers. Or that it provides significant motivation for it to gain network consensus. Absolutely zero proof or evidence provided


Totally meaningless. Because I like to eat pie, that means that anything that conflicts with my preference for pie will cause me to fuck up Bitcoin? Reductionist bullshit. No evidence a single thing untoward EVER happened, just a smear


The discounting is totally at the discretion of the miners. The suggested discount proposed by all of Core, not just Blockstream employees, is that the discount reflect the reduced burden of signatures on the permanent memory impact on full nodes, as well as the natural consequence of the fact that twice as many SegWit transactions can be placed in a block
Hmm? What's the explanation of why you are lying and attacking the volunteers who have been improving Bitcoin from the beginning? Is that just your nature to throw baseless attacks at people, or do you have some dark ulterior motive?

What if we just fix it by using a layer 2 network for payments where settlement happen instantly? 
I think off-chain is the right thing to work on here because the best we can do for on-chain is a not great job, whereas it is possible to have instantly safe Bitcoin transactions on a layer 2 network
Sometimes tech gets stuck at "not great" when people just try to make a wrong design solution work because people are already used to it: trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

That seems like a problem that should be solved first: node operators have to bear increased costs, and they don't get anything in return.
The consequence of ignoring that problem could be that node operators can no longer afford to run nodes, and we lose them, and you couldn't say to someone: you can use Bitcoin without trusting someone else or use Bitcoin privately without revealing your finances to someone else. If using Bitcoin demands relying on third parties who can do whatever they want to the currency, what makes it different from the existing world currencies?

@_date: 2016-05-23 05:37:52


Why it matters is that exponential things can get very expensive. When things get very expensive, people find cheaper, more efficient alternatives. So instead of everyone running a node, one person runs one node and then everyone just trusts them and shuts off their nodes, leading to big savings. Except that hurts the decentralization of the network. And the decentralization of the network is a big part of what gives Bitcoin value.


I don't know how many times I have to say this: LN nodes do not broadcast. They only send to a fixed number of nodes, no matter the size of the network. Other nodes do not even see the other transactions. When you say, "Every LN node has to verify 2tx" that is incorrect. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 12:43:42


Not really, the market doesn't seem to fear it either, so if you know that the halvening will screw up Bitcoin, put your money where your mouth is and short Bitcoin?

It's all a matter of clues, someone trying really hard will be able to piece together more clues, so if you want to evade them you have to leave very few clues. Dedicated people and intelligent algorithms can accomplish a lot to link things together, so that makes privacy difficult.
It's similar to security, there's no program you can run on your computer that will make your computer 100% secure from every threat. But if you do security positive things you can make your security better, to a degree where it is very unlikely you will ever have a problem from anyone who might want to attack you.
@_date: 2015-11-11 03:26:11
It depends on how you use it. There are things you can do to improve your privacy and things you can do to reduce your privacy.
In practice, tracing BTC through the blockchain has not been very effective against people who did take steps to protect their privacy. There've been a large number of criminals who steal Bitcoin or extort it and gotten away with it, so Bitcoin by itself isn't always enough to track someone down.
In the future analysis of the bitcoin network and surrounding services will get better which will lead to lower anonymity, but there are also privacy improving tools in development which will lead to greater anonymity.

@_date: 2016-05-21 07:47:33


I don't know what you're talking about, you have to connect the dots with logic


Making the miners wait for their payouts doesn't impact that rationale really, it's just a polite amount of time to allow people to adjust to a breaking change in software they rely upon. 


A hard fork is quite literally a network split so there is no getting around that
The main danger is that there are two coins, which fucks things up for people who expect there to be one coin. If miners have to wait a year for a payout, there is still the strong possibility of two coins because people can just tell miners to get stuffed, no matter what constrictions are placed upon them. 
We've had forks before, previously there was a Blockchain fork due to a blocksize issue and people lost hundreds of Bitcoin due to double spending they were not prepared to see. The double spending had nothing to do with difficulty or mining reward time, it had to do with a weakening of the network guarantee that there is one coin

I don't believe it, and it definitely isn't solved in PeerCoin as OP points to. Something can from the outside appear to be operating normally for a long time, but under stress it will break or just at some point it will break. For example every centralized money system like Liberty Reserve worked great, right up until the point that it failed. To determine if something will last, you have to consider the fundamentals of how it works
There are other huge conceptual problems with proof of stake, even if the primary one is solved. Like how to hard fork, how to distribute the coins, how to watch for signs that mining power has been consolidated. I'm dubious that PoS will ever be proven

@_date: 2016-05-30 06:05:44
That's what is coded to happen and there's too much momentum behind that code and too little reason to change it
Cutting in half at one particular date serves no real purpose over progressively lowering other than to be simple and easy, to reduce complexity cost. The rate of lowering is arbitrary like the other constants: block size limit, coin limit, PoW hash algorithm. Decisions have to be made
Stopping the high rate of inflation in a predictable way is important to make the coins meaningful as value tokens. Low inflation might be sustainable but it's questionable if mining should have a reward structure that is tied to the total value of all coins instead of tied to the demand for timely transaction inclusion
Inflating over a long period of time instead of starting super high and then depending on fees gives a bootstrapping assist to mining security to kick off a hopefully sustainable equilibrium of fees. It also helps distribute the coins a bit more evenly, another bootstrapping assist to ignite a self sustaining economy reaction

You forgot Ripple, lot of pumping for that here back in the day (Bitcoin doesn't work with centralized institutions well enough, let's make a centralized coin)
I think the next big altcoin to pump will be something similar to the DAO but made for Bitcoin. We need a new opcode for it to work: but the idea will be that you have a pegged sidechain where your coins are just moved to a sidechain and they retain their value. On this sidechain you buy company tokens, and then you can vote and get dividends and stuff. Of course, it's a great opportunity to scam by making phony companies and people feel safe on this sidechain because they can pull out 1:1 for Bitcoins, but instead of pumping the altcoin you pump the "companies"

In this case it is not Electrum that is not backwards compatible, but the network became less tolerant (as the error states)


Well since the network changed, that made old versions of Electrum obsolete. The network can't be expected to remain exactly the same forever, it has to improve and to improve it has to change


This is obviously not ideal, you should report this issue to Electrum's devs. They are volunteers so making this software bug-free is a collaborative effort that you can contribute to by providing a clear bug report


It's not ideal, but it's not really a big deal. The reason why is that your Bitcoins are not in the software at all, your Bitcoins are your private keys. And those keys are simply just some random numbers. So they aren't easily going to be obsolete: your funds are safe.

I think the difference from the thin blocks concept is that it focuses on pure speed and efficiency. The Block Relay is already much faster and more efficient than thin blocks, however it is not integrated into the Bitcoin protocol, it's a separate network. This would fold it into the Bitcoin network. I think it would also require more dedicated memory for unconfirmed transactions to achieve its speed: thin blocks is more tolerant to missing transactions but it gets that tolerance at the expense of speed. The Block Relay is also simpler and should be more resistant to DOS attacks that could target the Bloom Filter construction CPU time of thin blocks.
All these things are doing is avoiding the "send again" problem where first you receive an unconfirmed transaction and then you receive a confirmed copy when you download the block. This is most important for miners, because miners are in a race. The miners already use the Block Relay, so the advantage to the rest of the network would be some bandwidth savings. In theory, folding these relays into the Bitcoin network would also make the network more resilient to attack, since there are thousands of nodes and you might get some herd protection

I set my mempool to max out at 50mb which seems to work pretty well to get rid of this kind of trash, and I still see unconfirmed transactions when I receive funds

@_date: 2016-05-19 08:39:15
This transaction was respending an unconfirmed zero-fee transaction
Zero-fee transactions generally won't go through at the moment, so that transaction is unlikely to complete
Unconfirmed does not mean that you lost the funds, only that there is a transaction that has not been accepted by the network into a block. The funds essentially have not moved

The answer is maybe not. The seed standard is not sufficient to allow different clients to use the same seed with 100% redundancy. That's why it's a good idea to select an open source wallet: there is a greater chance you or someone else will have an old copy of the software.
It's also not the best idea to hold large quantities on your phone because of the difficulties inspecting updates and the potential for auto updates, also the physical security of the phone if you lose it.

Looks like a day ago a transfer was sent out with zero miners fee and was ignored by the network because it had no fee. Then half an hour ago another transfer was sent out with a high miners fee that spent the same funds and it was confirmed.

I never said the miners had to have limited block space. They can have as much space as they want. They just can't expect me to accept those blocks, they have no right to demand that of me and neither do you. Free market economics means people are free to make their own choices, so don't get pissy when I make a choice you don't like.


I said explicitly anyone can do what they want. Just don't try and force me into it. Easy right? If you want bigger blocks, or a miner wants bigger blocks, literally nothing is stopping them. Except that they want people to accept them. So you are getting mad that people are free to not accept them. You hate freedom of choice

You need 50% to really stop a soft fork, they can just delay it. There is a tradeoff though, if miners start deliberately orphaning Classic then we lose decentralization. So the fact that they don't agree right away to soft fork improvements also has a positive: it helps prove the mining network is actually distributed.

If you are very technical about what soft forks are, nothing ever requires a hard fork

I don't know what this means. Is "programmers" supposed to be some kind of insult? Similar to the line of FUD attack "the smart guys are too smart, they think they know better but we have more people"


Hmm so someone who can code can have no awareness of how to grow something. They must sprinkle some fairy dust on coders that makes them blind to markets. Go tell your FUD bullshit to fucking Zuckerberg and Bill fucking Gates?


You know what happens when shitty fucking managers come in and tell the coders to "Make it work" "I don't care if it breaks"? Well the system dies. Engineering and science is actually real, not a fucking fairy tale. Sorry to puncture your ego, but you need some fucking science to make software go, not "17 years of management experience".

Whether it's good or bad is definitely relevant to the question, I agree


There's a way to deal with miners who aren't doing their job: consensus change. We just stop paying attention to what they produce. The important part here is that the users decide. Not the miners. The network is here to serve the users, not the miners. Decisions are made by the users, not the miners.


This logic makes sense for soft-forks, but not for hard-forks. If Core tried to attack the Classic network in order to promote a hard fork, then I wouldn't support Core, even if they had all the best developers. The relevant part isn't what is the overall better plan, but the way you get there. It's not about the ends, it's about the means. I disagree with the rest of Classic plenty, but the relevant part here is that the plan is explicitly designed to disrupt service to Core users.


Yeah I did miss that, it says an AI decides, so it makes it seem like it's mining Classic

Scanning for argument.... No argument detected
Logic: SegWit can double capacity because SegWit transactions use half as much space in the legacy block space
Logic: A company that was trying to sabotage Bitcoin in some technical way would have to pass peer review with developers who don't work for that company. No developers see any issue with SegWit
Logic: Bitcoin fees are not decided by Core devs, they are decided by miners and suggested by Core Devs. SegWit fees should be at least half of normal fees because a miner can claim twice as many of them in a block, simple logic. Fees also serve a purpose of defending decentralization. SegWit transactions promote decentralization, so fees can also help prevent use of the network that could damage the overall system
Hmm I used actual Logic instead of innuendo about others motivation? That's why your position is useless, you can't defend it with any actual evidence.

The blockchain itself is fairly simple, it's just a straightforward record of all transactions. It is constantly visible to everyone, everyone with a full node has a copy, it can't be changed very quickly, it is very expensive to change so only a limited number of people are changing it, so it is a pretty stable last resort to fall back on. That's basically the foundation of why Bitcoin can work at all.

Addresses don't send amounts, underneath what you see in a wallet there is a different system that is how Bitcoin works technically. 
When you send funds you always send the complete amount of a previously unspent received transaction output; you must always pass along the total amount of funds you received at an address in the past to new destinations, you can't spend partial amounts. 
So Bitcoin does this thing where it just sends back to a new address that you control called a change output. It's like when you have to pay someone five bucks but you just have a hundred dollar bill, you get change back

Jeff Garzik is constantly changing his mind and unprofessionally calling out the Core Devs. 
This is especially rich since he is the first person who ever posted a hard fork patch to increase the block size, and his reasoning was "I didn't test this but we need to pretend to investors that Bitcoin has enough capacity to match PayPal"
He's got other terrible ideas, like "let's drop smart contracts from Bitcoin altogether"



He was pushing users to store their coins in centralized services (which later disappeared with people's money) (later he claimed he never did this):



Jeff pressured the Localbitcoins dev/creator to not provide service to Venezuela and Argentina, and banned him from the Core Dev channel for discussing translating into Farsi

The growth in system cost is exponential, this is just the facts and not an interpretation
I'll make it super super dumbed down:
- Network starts with 2 members. Each has to verify the each other guy, total validation cost 2
- Network adds 1 member to reach 3 members. Each has to verify all others, 3 members has 2 others to validate equals total validation cost 6.
- Network reaches 10 members, each has to verify all others, 10 members times 9 others to validate equals total validation cost 90
See how we grew the network member count by 5 times but the cost increase is 45 times?

Since you have Core you could just respend your unconfirmed coins back to yourself at a high fee. That is probably the best but you will need to turn on in preferences "spend unconfirmed change", then just spend all of your money back to a new address at a very high fee, like with the recommended fee slider all the way at the right.
Or you can transfer to QT:

I wouldn't require 100% support, but I want something broad. There's no way anyway to know if a person is genuine in their support or anti-support, so that's why I just want broad support.

You said Bitcoin [isn't a good store of value]( then you said it's digital gold.
Waiting for the one where you said a con-artist was Satoshi and then you changed your mind, that one at least I could understand.

Looking it up I see:
- 
This doesn't actually let you replace the fee, it just marks it as replaceable
- 
Which has the same issue. Toggling the RBF flag is the easy part, actually implementing the flow of replacement is the hard part :D
Maybe the basic design of it is the right place to start? How I'd imagine it working:
1. The words "Opt-in RBF" are never shown to the user, because that is not something an average user can understand. 
2. The feature is only ever enabled if there is a detection of a network condition that would put the transaction at risk of not being confirmed in a timely way (3 hours), so only at the low end of the fee spectrum. At the low end of the fee bidding, there should be a warning that requires the user to explicitly recongize that their transaction may not go through, and allow them to take that risk or bump their fee.
3. Fee up-bidding should happen automatically
4. Do not implement any feature in which the RBF target can be changed to an inward facing address
5. Notify the user when they have saved money by using RBF
6. Fee options for a transaction should change to a 4 option slider: lowest possible fee (20 blocks), economy (12 blocks), normal (6 blocks), priority (2 blocks).

LN is still under development, but the idea of having one wallet for every merchant is definitely the opposite of the idea of LN. That's why it's called "Network", because you can spend funds with people inside the network.
Bitcoin in Lightning will work similarly to how current multisig wallets work, but Lightning clients should also have the option that you can act as a financial relay in the network if you want, and earn some small fees in exchange for relaying transactions around the network.
LN transactions can go on the Blockchain, but they most often don't go on the Blockchain, which means a different set of security guarantees and other characteristics.
LN wallets will probably still also function as normal wallets though: in the event that you are trying to send money to someone who isn't well connected to LN. Also, LN is not great for savings, so you might keep two accounts: one cold long term storage wallet and one spending wallet.

I don't think there is a specific answer for how the "unbanked" will become banked, other than that they can download Mycelium and become "banked" as soon as they make a trade for bitcoin
Another problem here is that the unbanked and the poor of India and Africa have very few innovations being targeted at them. It will take a lot of work for Bitcoin to become accessible, and the current pace is slow.

6. Told them about seals with clubs for easy online poker at low stakes
7. Told them I don't have exact change for splitting lunch but I'll send Bitcoin

1. Debt settlement: beyond small amounts people don't want to mess with Bitcoin for this
2. Wealth protection from inflation or government interference. Generally people don't seem to care and the volatility makes it hard to get this point

4. Namecheap: I'm the only one I know who buys domains
5. Expedia: people I know don't have enough bitcoins to cover the expense or if they do, they don't want to use them because of volatility or cash back reasons
6. Freedom from government invasion of privacy: the only people I know who care about this are gold bugs and they are dedicated to gold because of its history

2. Fix a scaling problem that meant that a large increase in transactions could make the Blockchain impossible to sync to a normal computer
3. Fix a vulnerability in multisig wallets where one of the parties can steal funds from another party
4. Add a pathway to keep improving the scripting language in Bitcoin, which is very difficult at the moment

If my doctor recommended surgery, but he were in a hospital known for recommending unnecessary surgeries, I'd get a second opinion. I'd definitely learn more about it myself, that's just common sense. Listen to the experts, make up your own mind.
There's a second factor that I'm not sure you are considering, what is the right thing to do. Is it right to steal from the poor to give to the rich? Is it right to double tax? Is it right to give bankers corporate welfare? Is it right for the government to take what I already have not just what I'm currently earning? I'm saying that ethically taxes should be equitable. Are you just ignoring what is right and wrong?
If you can simply move your liquid cash to gold or other static assets, where does the inflation spurs investment argument come in? Why not just give tax breaks for your desired lending and positive investments rather than taxing the poor?
To your point about inflation growing the economy, that basically assumes that there is one factor to growing the economy, and that is inflation. How can you defend that assumption? If Bitcoin is successful at the level where inflation becomes a factor, a couple of percentage points of inflation will pale in comparison to the overall efficiency savings of the end of retail banking and FOREX and remittance. 
I'm not for deflation or for inflation, I'm for predictability. The best way to promote growth is to make a solid and predictable environment for investment. If you give a 1 million dollar loan, you have to pad the loan rate with the risk factor of unforseen inflation. You don't want to loan $1 million and get $500,000 back because of inflation.
If the risk factor is known, the loan market will compete with itself to give the lowest rate. I'm not saying Bitcoin is without risk, but I am saying it has the best potential for the lowest risk, since the mathematical release of Bitcoins are more predictable than who controls the US political power.

Not really what I said, I said the system cost
If you want exponential user growth and all users on chain it's still exponential
If you consider that usage is also somewhat of an exponential function up to a saturation point based on the number of places you can spend increasing: like if 1 member is added then the entire network of people who want to pay to that person now has a new target to spend to, meaning adding one person is not adding linearly one transaction per day but potentially adding one person times all their connected members transactions per day

I like the idea of fee expectation transparency
- What the miners "commit to" is totally meaningless if the rest of the network doesn't run it
- The atmosphere around this issue has become so politicized that if I were a developer or anyone influential I would think I could not speak freely about fee expectations
Maybe there is a way to conduct an anonymous straw poll about fee expectations to increase overall transparency regarding the subject
Personal opinion for the highest fee levels:
- $1 fees wouldn't bug me. More than that and I think it's time to look at the trade-offs, what we can do to lower fees. Low usage cost is a big secondary goal of Bitcoin and we should care about it.
I think the fee question, aside from block size, is still a huge unanswered question as how we will provide for the ongoing security of the chain after the block subsidy is gone and I haven't seen detailed plans from anybody on how it will be solved.

You should look at cointape.com - take a look at the number of transactions that aren't being included in blocks because they have a very small fee. Now ask yourself, why would every single day have tons of transactions with very tiny fees be submitted to never confirm? Who is saying to themselves, "I will pay a very low low fee and probably not get confirmed, but submit a tx anyway" not just one time, but day after day after day? Who is doing that?


Unfortunately, there was no choice towards this debate, because the big block faction seeks the elimination of the other side, you cannot compromise with people who want you gone. Even the wasting of the safety margin was proposed to end the debate, but the offer was brusquely rebuffed. 


This is what endless debate looks like. When everyone second guesses the plans, you get gridlock. Each person looks at every other person and says, "if he just agreed with me we'd have no problems"


SegWit is a prerequisite for Lightning to be rolled out, bigger blocks are not

Miners sell transaction space in blocks. It's a typical auction pricing mechanism. At some price, you can pretty much always get in if you're willing to outbid the other customers.
You buy space for your transaction with the "fee". This fee goes to the miner.

The average person doesn't need a full node, you can use a lite client just fine
It's not important to have a lot of full nodes, more is meaningless because the integrity guarantees are all based on mining which has a solid incentive system. Miners also have an incentive to have access to a full node since they get the fees
Currently there is a very hard cap on transaction growth, and transaction growth isn't that fast. Transactions in the future can also be offloaded to sidechains potentially or the transaction history can be pruned of useless data to make it smaller
Also this has been discussed to death so if you search you will find more answers

There is a clear plan, but it is still under development. The system is peer to peer so the network forms from peers connecting to the network.
LN fails to the Bitcoin network, so if a connection between your client and another LN peer doesn't work for whatever reason, you will just do a normal Bitcoin transaction.
Over time, the idea is that LN will get progressively more reliable and bigger and failing back to the Blockchain will get less common.

4. Make money overseas, when you are visiting the US, spend as normal. No worry about minimum balance charges and maintaining a US bank account.

Miners can mine blocks above the 1mb limit but the coins in that block are worthless, and they pay the opportunity cost of making a  block that complies with the limit. (BU tried this)
The only obvious way they can immediately start mining above the 1mb limit and not mine worthless coins is to use this thing called SegWit to do so. This would let them make blocks that are around 2mb.
The catch is that 95% of miners (by hash power, really not very many individuals) need to signal their intent to use SegWit and then they need to wait a month before they can start using it.
They wouldn't necessarily double their earnings though, price pressure doesn't mean you can just multiply. Miners mine 12.5 coins per block, let's say we all agreed we were fine with them raising it back to 25 per block, they might not get 1600*coin for those, it might bring the price down a lot. People pay higher prices for scarce things because they bid each other up.

Typically when people say controlling, they mean that the person actually decides something, and not just a lot of people agree with them and respect their opinion. Developers just put out updates to software, for free, that anyone can change. They don't force anyone, they don't auto-update anyone, they just publish an update. So not only are you saying that you want me to be forced to accept something I don't want, you are also demanding that people's free speech to publish the code that they want be silenced?

The blockchain can be fairly secure even at a lower price
1. Interested parties could step in to mine voluntarily to help the network
2. People who already have sunk cost in single purpose asics would run at an investment loss but at a gain over electricity
3. People who have free electricity will run their equipment at a theoretical electricity loss
Also, currently the network power to be secure from even a fairly determined attacker is far exceeded. At this point you'd need a huge company or state actor to attack Bitcoin via he hash rate. It's basically hoped that this won't happen because it wouldn't be characteristic of how state actors work and they'd have little to gain

Miners don't need to validate transactions, that's the job of full nodes
Bitcoin Core has a set of code in it that defines what is and isn't valid, and there are efforts in the project to clearly demarcate this code, which is called "consensus"

Splits make sense because you can't buy partial shares
You can buy partial Bitcoins
So we tried to push smaller units as normal but it hasn't taken off. I think the reason is that it's psychologically too difficult for people
My idea to try next is to push for smaller units but use a name that is totally removed from the conversion ratio: like "Dorians": 1000 Dorians is 1 Bitcoin. That way there is a clear signal you are dealing with something different and you need to convert
1,000,000 Craigs can be 1 Bitcoin. Using the name of fake Satoshis can indicate subtly that your units are not really complete Bitcoins

He was up front about it and gave everyone a fair chance to mine from day 1. Also, theoretically the network could just consider his coins null and void

MTGox shenanigans played a big part for sure
More broadly the run up was just a big news cycle about a new thing people had never heard of: Bitcoin. As people become exposed to Bitcoin, it clicks with some percentage of them and they buy it. Also, people try to front-run that process, expecting future people to hear about Bitcoin for the first time and some percentage of them to want some
There was a lot of hype about it and the media hadn't really Snowdenized it yet. If the same media hype happened today, we'd probably have a bigger rise. Buying coins in 2013 was super annoying because all the first mover businesses were run by amateurs who didn't really know what they were doing like Charlie Shrem and Mark Karpelès. I think the exchanges we have now would do much better in another super rally, but you go to war with the army you have

I'm not sure that these guys were convinced of anything more than that Craig was convincing
Questions abound about why someone would so readily accept a story that is so thinly constructed 
If I ask myself, "Would these guys have bet all their Bitcoin on Craig being Satoshi?" I think the answer would be that none of them would have.
The idea that "anyone can be conned" is offensive to me. It's offensive to he idea of Bitcoin really: do you want to be your own bank when someone can con you and steal all your money? After all Andreas says that can be done to anyone!
In my opinion that's bullshit, another truism that tries to gloss over the reality that people have self determination and responsibility for what they say and do. If you are conned and you had twenty warnings over months and months from your peers that the con was coming, and you don't do even the most basic diligence before buying into the con fully then it's not "anyone can get conned", it's gross negligence

If you say the average miner, maybe you then include the guys with a worthless old ASICs? If not, and you are just including the top miners, then you should just say the top investors?
We can look at Blockchain totals to get an idea of what top investors have in Bitcoin and how many there are. 
98% of all Bitcoins were sent to 330k addresses. So that already discounts the minority of the "millions of people"
About 43% of all the coins were sent to about 2000 addresses. That's a small number of people who control a lot of Bitcoins' wealth.
There are a lot of people very invested in knowledge and money who are also holders. As an aggregate, the holders are more invested, it's just simple math: 7 billion stored, vs whatever the ASICs cost, which is almost certainly less than 1 billion, considering that they will be obsolete soon and they don't even make that much a year.

Ease of setup is part of the puzzle but I wouldn't oversell it to a merchant. I've never successfully convinced a merchant (except maybe namecheap indirectly) because I can't really sell them that Bitcoin will have any substantial benefit towards their business except maybe me frequenting it more often. Maybe if there was a way for you to gather a group of people who offered regular business, the case would be more compelling
One idea I had for small merchants is to ask them to accept Circle Pay. It's a USD wallet that is user friendly and straightforward, however you can pay someone in Bitcoin. I feel like Circle is missing a trick by not providing a hybrid bitpay competitor, but there's probably regulatory issues

I don't think people should go around selling a hard fork in a way that may trick people into going against their own interests. 
If there were a real problem, it would be orthogonal to the block size issue, and Gavin or Toomim could submit a separate soft fork proposal to address it. They don't seem to care about anything except the block size as far as I can tell though, so I wouldn't hold my breath for their tunnel vision to end.
SegWit doubles the block size. Making the block size unlimited would be extremely unwise, trying to scale on-chain is not working and is mathematically impossible, but the most important aspect of making this determination is to not coercively or deceptively pushing people into it. People must look at the facts and decide for themselves without others feeding them false information.
If we do make hard fork changes, there are decent and obvious ways to go about it that are not coercive and dividing. Here are two ways: 1) wait for the hard fork prompting issue to be obvious to everyone, such as in an bug fix situation. Or 2) put the hard fork activation in a version way ahead, so the old versions are already long obsolete by the time it arrives.
Here is what a hard fork should not do: 1) deliberately marginalize a significant portion of the network. 2) occur quickly when no imminent issue is obviously apparent. 3) 
be presented in a political way that seeks to draw supporters into a black or white mindset. 4) attempt to abuse the network's centralized weak points such as the exchanges and payment processors so as to have coordinated leverage to threaten denying service to those who do not comply

Markets often rise on uncertainty and fall on certainty, people are naturally prone to overvalue potential gain and underestimate potential risk.
It's impossible to say exactly why markets move in this situation, but one theory can be that the eventual sale of confiscated bitcoins was priced in the instant it was apparent it would happen so the actual sale event doesn't truly represent an increase in supply. 
Good news people would be waiting for in this situation would then be a large institutional or wealthy buyer entering the market in a big public way, which has happened in previous auctions and would probably happen at a price above market spot, which would be a strong confidence signal.
Bad news would be that the government could not find a lot of buyers for the coin and they would be selling below market spot price.

The problem as I hear it comes from use of the Payment Protocol, which was based on the problematic SSL standard despite many objections 
As a backup, try using the address and amount method: that is simple and reliable, if unwieldy 
The Payment Protocol wasn't well designed and it seems hard to implement, so far it is not proving to be a good standard and no one is working to finish it and fix its problems. 
Personally I think we should consider the Payment Protocol harmful, or in a state where it should not be exposed to real users

The previous transaction was legit, but not confirmed.
The input funds of both transactions are the same, that's why there is a conflict.
If you use an unspent transaction output as the input to a new transaction, you must always spend the entire amount, so the amount has to be the same in both. Generally speaking if you desire to spend less, your wallet will also construct an output back to you, called a change output
The outputs in older one were selected to be 4 BTC to a P2SH 3xx address (probably a multisig wallet) and 4 BTC to a standard address. 
The outputs in the newer one were selected to be 7.5 to a standard address, and 0.49940620 to a P2SH 3xx address (probably a multisig wallet)
If your wallet is showing an error, you might want to try and reset it somehow, depending on your wallet. If not, you can just forget about the 4 BTC send you did on Friday, it's like it never happened.

They have a very poor security and privacy track record
- they let Roger Ver have access to their admin panel, which he abused to publicly doxx someone he accidentally sent Bitcoins to in order to push them into sending the money back
- they offered and charged money for a coin privacy service that didn't work
- they generated Bitcoin addresses using random numbers generated from a 3rd party random number web service they didn't control, which led to people losing coins
- much of the spam from recent spam attacks appears to have been sent through their gateway
- they made worrying statements that suggested they are tracking where their users are sending bitcoins
- they allowed anyone who could guess your username to download your wallet
- they encouraged address reuse which harms network privacy and the security of their users
- they did not implement fee calculation correctly, leading to stuck transactions 
- they failed to keep their open source versions of their wallet up to date with the version they gave users, despite repeated requests
- they used weak native random number generation to generate private keys, leading to coin loss
- they supported SatoshiDice which sent a tiny dust output to users to notify them of a loss, abusing the Blockchain to send messages and creating a permanent RAM storage burden increase for nodes 
- they logged and stored without hashing the IPs of all users in relationship to their addresses, reducing user privacy needlessly
- their new wallet will fail to upgrade and leave your wallet bricked if you have more than 1000 addresses
- they don't provide a good security solution against op referenced phishing attack, leading people to lose funds
- their iOS version is often simply broken and unusable
- they changed their backup mechanism to be incompatible with their existing tool to recover from backup, removed the old backup tool, did not publish any new backup tool. The backup they now provide is very difficult to actually restore from because they provide no tool to parse it and no documentation 
- they mislead people into thinking that they are the Blockchain
- they've threatened to switch users to an alternative consensus rule set without even consulting them

It depends if it's SegWit funds or normal funds from the SegWit wallet
Normal funds will send normally
Sending with SegWit funds will publish a transaction that spends unspent SegWit outputs, in a way that when serialized to the Blockchain makes sense even to non SegWit wallets
You will get normal funds not SegWit funds (like how multisig addresses are sent multisig spendable funds but send normal funds, your address type is key)

I'd like to see the ability to increase the blocksize dynamically, but without ignoring the increased network cost and the centralizing effect it has by favoring large miners over small.
In order to help model/counteract that cost, miners would gain the ability to "time shift" block rewards 8 years into the future, forgoing them in the present. In exchange for time shifting and therefore giving up some block reward, they would get extra space for more transactions. For example a miner could send 1BTC into the future and get 10k extra transactions worth of fees in the present.
The entire network would benefit by increasing the longevity of the block reward mechanism, evil miners trying to play games with fake transactions would have to pay a cost for that, fees would be a bit more predictable given a relation to the block size, the blocksize would automatically contract during times of low priority or low activity transactions, DOS and spam would become more expensive

The schism of core developers is just a fiction, the whole idea of "two teams" is pure lies. There is one Bitcoin dev team. Even if I hated that team, that wouldn't change the reality 
We heard about the XT "team", but we saw no commits. Meanwhile, Core devs had commits every day. We heard about Core new features, Gavin spun this as "more lines of code are bad". Mike Hearn said the design of 0.12 was broken and shouldn't be released. We heard about how carefully the developers think through these problems, Brian called them "too smart". We heard about a big Classic roadmap and feature voting on consider it: lots of features, where are the commits?
Talk is cheap, math and software are not, I think that's the lesson here. Craig can say he's Satoshi all he likes, Gavin can say it too, Gavin can say there's a schism. But there's no proof, this is a fake version of reality

Based on the way I've seen people use Bitcoin, they are generally not well informed enough to understand that some unconfirmed transactions have a better probabilistic chance of being confirmed than others. It's simpler just to promote a simple model of Bitcoin: transactions with confirmations are safe, transactions with no confirmations are not safe. Even that is simplifying a bit: a confirmation can be reorganized away. Promoting unconfirmed transactions as anything more than a weak promise is a bad idea.

Both of those values are part of the security measures put in place to keep Bitcoin stable against potential attacks.

The recovery phrase, it is your Bitcoins, so be very careful with its security. The KeepKey is not your Bitcoins, the recovery phrase is.

@_date: 2016-05-23 05:34:18


The market value of any good doesn't just revolve around the supply, it revolves around the amount of demand there is for it. The supply of Bitcoin is fixed and predictable, even as mining difficulty changes unpredictably the supply does not. So whatever the miners are doing, what they are spending, has only an indirect impact on the supply and demand factors that determine the market price of Bitcoin. Eventually the supply of new Bitcoins peters off and then we have a fixed amount to work with, so the remaining variable is the demand of people who want to have a bitcoin.


A company could easily come and spend $30 billion and have absolutely no impact on the Bitcoin market cap. They are not really linked. 


Ignoring that a company spending money doesn't equate to a guaranteed market increase, so assuming that the market cap of Bitcoin does double, then yes the mining costs should double as well, according to the design of the network. In practical reality, this may not happen perfectly, however that is the general intent. The mining costs are designed to follow the market price of Bitcoin.

The total system cost is an exponentially growing cost


From my personal perspective, I don't like the idea of unbounded costs. I run a node because it is the only trustless and private way to use Bitcoin, but also because I can afford it.
When we start telling people they have to sync a terabyte of transaction data to get started, they are going to start saying, "well that's just not practical for me". I see people already say a variation on this all the time, "I have to sync 80gb? yeah screw that".
I know that personally I am not interested in writing a blank check and saying, "I will pay whatever it costs no matter what". That's quite literally impossible for me to do. I will pay up to a limit. Beyond that I will be barred from using Bitcoin trustlessly and privately.

Bitcoin was never made as something that the financial industry could switch to. The whole point of it is to resist the centralization of the financial industry, not complement it.
Watching startups die and pivot is not a concern: the strategy venture capitalists use to invest in startups is to watch 9/10 of them die and hopefully have 1 succeed. That involves a lot of startups dying and defecting.
There's plenty to be done right now, but not with the Bitcoin codebase, we need more people wanting and using Bitcoin in their lives.

You could use RBF to increase the priority of a low priority transaction. Like if you submit an unimportant transaction but changed your mind and wanted it to be a high priority transaction
Another use could be bundling transactions to be more efficient and save money. Like let's say you send out transactions every half hour, if the last one hasn't hit a block yet you can fold two together to get some savings
Another use could be high end bidding. When you submit your transaction to the network you don't know if someone else will come along and outbid you. You could use RBF to engage in a bidding war with the other people so that you have a better chance at getting into a block as soon as possible 
It's a pretty open ended tool

SegWit2x is the direct product of a backroom meeting, closed to even the company that sponsored the open source development of SegWit itself
Well known members of the press such as Aaron van Wirdum have been banned from participating. Long established Core developers and mining pool operators like Luke-jr were similarly banned
A requirement that people use their government registered name was instituted, which would have even likely banned Satoshi Nakamoto from participating, and exposes any would be contributor to government violence. All for the reason to protect the business interests of people who actively promote and sell replacements for Bitcoin and outright scams like Paycoin, like Eric Voorhees has done. These people prey upon the weak and misinformed for their own avaricious enrichment, through fraud and secrecy. They must be outed. They are thieves and liars.

This would actually make for an unstable incentive system for a while. Sure a miner can take this super high fee block, but the other miners can ignore them and try to take it for themselves. If they get lucky and get two blocks in a row, which is not uncommon, they get to take the high fee. All they risked is ten or twenty bitcoins to get a shot at two hundred plus bitcoins.
Also as a miner or someone who can predict that this will happen, you can start to double spend, knowing that there is a good chance that the confirmations will be rolled back. Execute some trades for high amounts of altcoins and then double spend back to yourself to double your money.
Bitcoin Core has some strategies to counteract this problem but it requires people behaving responsibly and not deliberately throwing away large sums for random reasons.

Let's say I think this:

1. However if those devs feel that the other side reneged on their side of the deal, they should back out
1. The rest of the core devs should base their actions on judging the merits of the code and not worry about any agreements or political statements
1. The Bitcoin repository should continue only merging consensus changes that follow the consensus, and not try to set or lead consensus. They should only merge hard fork code under that rubric
1. Risky hard forks should be a last resort option, not a tool for trying to sell Bitcoin to investors or grow unsustainable use cases

The solution I propose is that there are no votes. You simply don't pay attention to what miners do. If they decide to change the rules and you don't like it, just ignore them. No one else's opinion pushes you: you decide for yourself. Everyone does the same thing.
If there is a change that needs to happen, you implement or copy that change from someone else. If it needs to happen in a coordinated way and it isn't urgent, you signal to others that you will switch at a future date, and then you follow through and leave behind those who didn't follow. If it needs to happen in a coordinated and quick way, you just sacrifice compatibility with other people. Miners aren't the government, and neither are holders. No one is the government

That's not what Bitcoin is about. 
Miners making decisions for the rest of us is wrong, and dangerous. Miners who abuse their power are attacking the network, and miners attempting to deny service to the network or trick people into changing consensus rules, they should be actively resisted.

- Miners need to work with devs to adjust mining software to SegWit and the version signalling
This will probably take a couple weeks
- Wallet devs need to publish new updated versions that use SegWit - first wallets supporting SegWit will probably be Armory, Bitcoin Core, GreenBits, Ledger, mSIGNA, Trezor
The other actively maintained wallets will probably take 0-6 months to release SegWit compatibility
- Users need to start sending and receiving using SegWit

The problem with a Bloom Filter as far as a resource attack goes is that it's not a simple lookup, it's a data structure that has to be assembled and figured out. For a normal situation where everyone is friendly, that isn't a big problem, but in Bitcoin you want to also think about abnormal situations where someone is abusing the system to force people into devoting more resources than they anticipated into the Bloom Filters. Then you need some kind of anti-spam mechanism to counter that, and it gets complicated from there.

I didn't say that holding is bad, I like holding. However holders can't all stop holding and keep their value, any more than miners can recover their investment in miners if Bitcoin dies. The scale of what holders stand to lose is billions, the scale of what miners have to lose is millions.
There isn't really any need for anyone to make decisions. Big blocks can easily coexist with small blocks. This is how SegWit works, for everyone who likes SegWit and wants blocks to be twice as big, they can use SegWit. For everyone who disagrees they can not use SegWit. Everyone wins

I find it terrible that they keep the bitcoins in a hot and cold wallet
Instead it should work like this
1. To deposit bitcoin, you need 2x the amount of bitcoin you want to deposit
2. With half the bitcoin, you create a smart contract: send coins to yourself in a 2 of 2 transaction with the exchange. The coins are locked until the exchange says you can have them.
3. You keep the other half of the bitcoin for later
4. When someone buys your bitcoin off the exchange, instead they are just buying a debt that you must pay to them, not real bitcoin. The exchange then forces you to pay that debt with the other half of the bitcoin that you saved. You pay to the exchange + the other person in a multi sig transaction
5. When you have paid your debt, the exchange unlocks your bitcoins and they send back to yourself
If you choose not to pay back your debt in a timely way, the exchange destroys their key and you lose those coins, and you are not credited with the fiat
This way:
1. The exchange can't be hacked except to swap the debtors identities or something like that, much more limited damage
2. The exchange itself can't steal your coins, they never have them
3. You can't steal from the exchange because you will lose more than you will gain if you don't repay your debt

Bitcoins are generated via an ongoing process called mining. Basically it is just a way to slowly distribute the coins and it also helps to solve the problem of one person trying to spend his money in two different places at the same time

If it doesn't confirm after a long time, it will probably be because of the dust limit that prevents people sending very small amounts on the network. This transaction sends an amount of $0.03 which I think is still above the dust limit, but I could be wrong

 Lie 2: Blockstream being a for-profit company is relevant


This is about as relevant as saying, "People need to eat". It is meaningless, and is only used as a cudgel to promote your other lies, it has no relevance, especially given that the vast majority of other developers, including the lead developer who is not employed by Blockstream, who all agree that the SegWit proposal is the best course of action. Literally zero active developers think this is a bad idea, or that a block size hard fork is warranted instead. 
 Lie 3: Blockstream wants SegWit to make Sidechain Pegs cheaper


You provide no evidence for this. I could say, you are posting these lies to cover the fact that you murdered JFK. That statement has about the same level of evidence as what you said. It's just putting two random things together without any proof or logic.

UASF effect? Blocks that do not enforce UASF SegWit rules may be judged invalid and their block rewards forfeit when the UASF goes into effect.
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:17:09
If the UASF is painful it is because the miners made it painful
1. If there are few users who do UASF and the miners don't follow then it's not very painful since no one bothered
2. If there are few users who do UASF and the miners do follow then it's not very painful since it is backwards compatible and no one will even notice
3. If there are many users who do UASF and the miners don't follow, then it's painful but the miners should properly want to see market confidence and a good user experience and if they don't that part was broken anyway, plus they can cause similar pain at their discretion (like by activating masf SegWit and then not enforcing it)
4. If there are many users who do UASF and the miners follow, then it's not painful for anyone
So the only painful possibilities are if you are switching but not many also switch (try to avoid that by keeping your ear to the ground) or if the miners deliberately make it painful, which they should theoretically be incentivized to not do

That's the thing about volatility that people don't really get, it's gonna cost you money but it's also going to make you money.
Unfortunately this works against people's illogical psychology: when it goes down people think "I don't want to spend now, I'm already in the hole I'll wait for it to go up". When it goes up people think "I don't want to spend now, it's already made me a lot of money why should I get out when it's doing a great job"
I'm not sure if people will ever learn: the market price now is what you have. You can't just wait and it will go up again or wait and it will go down again, there's no predicting what levels it will go to or what time frame

what a cheap lesson about how you should never ever check keys into your repository
@_date: 2016-05-18 09:26:12
It depends what utility you want out of a savings account
1. Bitcoin is Volatile - so if you want a fund that will always be there for you to draw on and have the same stored value, Bitcoin might not be the best tool for that job.
1. Bitcoin is a Commodity - if you want an investment which is actually representing a loan or ownership of another project that isn't zero sum relating to wealth, then Bitcoin isn't a good tool for that job either.
So you will get a store of value that is going up and down all the time quite unpredictably in large movements: even quite possibly downwards forever, and is simply an arbitrary value token that isn't really accomplishing anything.
But you will also get one of the only forms of wealth that doesn't require trusting someone else to maintain an "account balance" for you and tell you how, when and to whom you can spend your wealth. That's a pretty cool feature, so I recommend Bitcoin if you want that.

Another options is virtual bitcoins.
If people deposit their coins in a bank-like entity (think coinbase), Coinbase can just assume that not everyone is going to pull out their coins at once and start making virtual bitcoins
This can lead to inflation of Bitcoin, it isn't the same as a state sponsored inflation but it is a way for 1 billion people to "have a bitcoin" without increasing the supply
There's also a limit to the leverage a bank like entity is going to put on their true reserves. 1 billion would be like a 50x leverage, so it might not reach that point

Mike Hearn was actually a big proponent of Payment Channels and wrote a bunch of code to make them easy to use
I think the most popular example of their public use is 
Generally speaking, four things prevent people from using Payment Channels:
1. They require more development work, meaning more money invested, there's not as much tooling to make using them easy
2. Bitcoin transactions are fairly cheap (currently ranging from $0.01-$0.05 depending on confirmation speed preference)
3. They require repeated transactions and are not suitable for one off transactions (Lightning / Thunder / Strawpay are ideas to fix that)
4. People often prefer just to buy a batch of things without worrying too much: no need to pay per the minute when they don't risk a lot buying by the hour / day / month
There are efforts underway to make using Payment Channels easier/cheaper for developers, for example SegWit malleability fix should make using them easier, and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY can have benefits for their use as well

Bitcoin is under attack at every centralized point though. For example, if you try to sell illustrations with bare female breasts on Coinbase, they will shut you down: the only reason for refusing service seems to be offending religious sensibilities. They did this to someone, and all the while he just kept selling on PayPal where it was allowed. On the fiat exchanges they are banning people for using the currency for arbitrary reasons to keep the regulators off their backs. Gavin Andresen attempted to use the mining and fiat exchange centralization as a weapon to force controversial changes on the entire network. Don't take decentralization for granted, it's absolutely necessary to maintain the network and the currency's existence.

Well we don't have adaptable block sizes, so what you are suggesting is impossible at the moment, beyond the soft-coded limits.
Within the soft limits I think it would be nice if the miners went along with it: people don't like unpredictable prices, so they should choose a range for people and say they will try and stay within that range. 
I don't think this range idea would appeal to everyone though because they'd be like, "if the miners can increase their block size for a while, why can't it always be increased?"

You're pushing this other coin just by supporting it
Free speech has nothing to do with mining, the signaling is supposed to be a mechanism to prevent accidental hard forks, it's not advertising space to promote altcoins
And if it were, you're a private individual and don't need to run those advertisements, that's not even what the function of the system is
Ask yourself why do we need miners? Is it so we can have some guys make decisions, we can't be allowed to decide for ourselves? Is it because we need advertising space? Or is it as the Satoshi white paper lays out: we just need someone to prevent double spends? 
That's why this fake campaign of "75% of the miners means that consensus rules change" is garbage. That's just a big lie - miners don't decide the consensus rules, even 100% of them - and it's one you are pushing by helping to publish blocks that abuse the anti-hard contentious fork signaling mechanism in order to help bring about a contentious hard fork.
Miners vote not mattering to consensus rules isn't some weird new idea from Bitcoin Core or something I'm projecting onto Satoshi. Here is Jeff Garzik of Classic describing how Bitcoin works




Let the people lead the choice. If you want free speech make some new messaging crypto tech that can't be stopped. That's the idea of crypto anarchy: free speech that can't be stopped. That's what you are actually destroying by pushing for an unlimited block size that will make running a node impossibly costly for normal users.

As far as I can tell, this could be a problem even if BIP 109 were a soft fork, meaning being careful in both cases is important in order not to invalidate things that people are expecting to be valid in the future. 
Like you could do a soft fork to make Satoshis coins un-spendable. Anything more restrictive can be done in a soft fork.
The part of bip109 people take issue with is that as a general rule shouldn't we always try to avoid making things un-spendable? Why do we want this limit if we have solved the problem and don't need the limit? 
It would be like if we solved the block limit and the sighash limit but the roll out of that fix was stopped by someone wanting to increase the sighash limit via hard fork and they had to lower the block limit to do it :D

That's just like your opinion. There's no logical reason this should be the test, you just arbitrarily stated it. So I think it's about as relevant as if you stated "the only litmus test should be if the sender of a transaction believes in Bitcoin Jesus" - meaning it's not logic based it's a faith based argument


Here's the reality of free market economics: people are actually free to decide what they want and not be pushed around by assholes trying to decide for them. My personal decision is I don't want to pay for some douche to penny flood the network with zero fee transactions just because some miner decided they didn't care enough to stop that. That's my choice, that's what actual freedom looks like.

Bitcoin is not a voting system.
Whoever told you that a majority of nodes control updates, patches or the protocol was incorrect.
Your friend is right: a "node majority" would be an absolutely terrible way to run things, and it isn't how Bitcoin is run
Bitcoin operates on a consensus basis. Any fundamental Bitcoin protocol change needs full consensus: 100% of nodes.
There are some legitimate centralization concerns: centralization of exchanges, centralization of development work, web wallets, that kind of thing. Someone attacking the network by running too many nodes is not a concern at all

BIP 148 scheduled a soft fork for August 1st. 
If a majority of miners decide to not follow the peer to peer network that enforces BIP 148 then those miners will be forced off of the network and create their own coin, a network split and 2 coins for as long as the majority of miners continue to not follow BIP 148 requirements

I'm experienced with localbitcoins and is advise against what you are doing
Here's what I'd suggest:
1. Setup your localbitcoins account and arrange a trade
2. Demand the person deposits their coins with localbitcoins and get a confirmation code
3. Show up, give the prearranged fiat and get the confirmation code
4. Transfer the coins out of your LBC wallet and into your paper wallet
This is the recommended way to use LBC and your exposure to counterparty risk is minimal. Make sure you:
1. Read thoroughly all the reviews of the seller, including unconfirmed
2. Meet in a public place
3. Discuss all the details of the trade before meeting

Core has had a variety of maintainers release updates (Satoshi, Gavin, Wladimir), plus other versions commonly in use such as Luke-Jr's Bitcoin Knots, and other Bitcoin implementations like btcd. Answer: lots of people.
Also, these people cannot act unilaterally, they have no special control over their code, because the code is open source. If others disagree with a decision they make, they simply fork the code and go to a new repository.


Miners quite frequently offer feedback and take time to come to consensus about a Core release. It is not at all straightforward. Right this moment, a non-controversial improvement to Bitcoin scripting is still working its way through the process. 


Please describe in what way beyond "influenced by, and transactions ordered/selected by" this control manifests itself
Your logic is specious. It's like saying that Heinz controls the Ketchup market because they are in the dominant position. People like Heinz Ketchup, people like Core developers, because what they offer is what people in the market desire. If people don't want Core, they are under no compunction to select Core, and indeed many people in the marketplace do not select Core.

The fact that you are in this position in the first place is the problem, not that I see any solution to it other than to make general moves towards increased decentralization
The abuse is twofold:
1. Helping to promote an attack on the network by supporting Classic (which blocks even non blocksize things like CSV which is needed for payment channel improvements).
2. Using your undeclared hash rate as a bribe to get Classic hashers to come to your pool. If they hash somewhere else, they just get their own hashing. If they hash on your pool, you will give them some of the undeclared as well.

When I use Bitcoin to buy goods online, it's because I've had bad experiences with PayPal where they locked my account for no reason, and so I use Bitcoin for payment as my preferred alternative. I don't like spending from a cc online because I don't trust merchants to store it securely

Trezor with multi factor is probably the best solution now but it's not reached a level where it's so easy a caveman could do it

Some types of addresses actually are not long enough and the worry is that in the far future people could steal money by brute-forcing signatures. SegWit has to increase the address length for 3xx type addresses to increase the security against this attack.


Sig data isn't moved around, it's put in a new bigger block. It's just that there is also a legacy sync mode so that the old clients don't get totally left behind.


All the data is hashed. The signatures are all hashed, just like they are hashed today, but there are now 2 hashes: the kind of hash that includes the signature and then the new kind of hash that does not include the signature. The new hash that does not include the signature is useful because it can't be changed by other people, only the private key owner can change that hash.

I'd have to disagree with Adam Back as having not made any contribution (and of course I'd need an example of a misrepresentation, none spring to mind). Adam Back is the President and co-founder of an organization that is committing more code and adding more improvements to Bitcoin than any other. The work produced by this organization is so useful that it has even been copied and folded in to competing projects, like Bitcoin Classic. Adam Back was also one of the first people that Satoshi sent his white-paper to, even before publishing it to the mailing list, and of course he is cited in the Bitcoin white-paper directly.
Adam Back, Peter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, they are founders of a company dedicated to improving Bitcoin. Even Jeff Garzik, one of the Classic "developers" said that those guys should be "lead dev" on the Bitcoin Project.




So I'd say that he's an important part of a group that is very useful to Bitcoin

If no one ever said anything Bitcoin would be run by convicted criminals and liars, u/bitcoin_charlie and his Bitcoin foundation of Ver, Karpeles, and Andresen. They'd have installed their fake conman Satoshi and Bitcoin as we knew it would have ended there. Because we spoke up, they did not subvert Bitcoin to their ends.

This is a very far fetched scenario and it ignores the easy solution 
1. 95% of hashing is improbable in a commodity market where anyone on earth can enter without many special advantages to be found
2. The developers are pretty neutral in this so I don't know why they'd be brought into this or even need to be, anyone can be a developer on Bitcoin 
3. The difficulty would reset eventually, and given you're already assuming a fork, could reset even faster with a difficulty reset fork
4. This scenario assumes the fees in 2020 are not providing much compensation
Even given these assumptions, the remaining users could
1. Fork to reset difficulty 
2. Fork to a new hashing algo 
It would mess with Bitcoin for sure but it wouldn't be a knockout punch

This is totally re-framing the question dishonestly to pretend like Classic is "fixing" something, when it's just poorly sweeping the problems it brings under the rug, leaving real debt for future users of Bitcoin


They claim that, because it is actually a fix to make a quadratic time problem happen in linear time, and not a brute force limit to make high quadratic time usages never happen.


This is because it is what is called, "opt-in", it's where instead of coercively trying to force everyone through Sybil attacks, lies, elaborate voting mechanisms that your brother controls, trying to secretly coordinate denial of service attacks on the network, spreading conspiracy theories and hate about the volunteer developers, personally attacking them and threatening their families with violence, developing vote bots to downvote everything you don't like, creating forums to promote a singular and incorrect view of the facts at hand, you actually let people decide what they want for themselves.

The withdrawal was sent with a low priority fee - about $0.01 if you adjust for its size. For a priority transaction, a fee should be about $0.05 for the fastest possible sending time.
I advise that you wait a bit - you can also visit this page  - your fee is 16 Satoshis/byte, so you can see that there are about 3000+ transactions ahead of you, not counting future transactions that may come in. Confirmations come about every ten minutes and usually confirm about 2000 transactions.

Ugh this bullshit. 
SegWit transactions are the future of all transactions, they fix a bug. 
The hard fork element is a thousand percent unnecessary and unrelated. The reason it's in there is because the problem is much worse at naked 2mb: hint what happens when the validation time goes above 10 minutes...

I've heard that selling on Circle is good for small amounts, but bad in large amounts.
The theorized reason is that they sometimes give you a great rate for selling, because they have only one price that ignores the spread between buy and sell prices. If they think people are abusing it in a way they can't sustain, they kick them out for a vague reason.
Coinbase has a real exchange, so you can sell 20 BTC there no problem: get on the exchange for the best rates, however they often have bugs, so be cautious and watch your transfers in case they forget about one

If you re-spend an unconfirmed transaction that has no fee, even if you include a fee, it will probably not confirm
That's because miners don't really pay attention to the later fees (although they could if they wanted to)

The idea is that Bitcoin has some special properties that make it valuable for use in a marketplace but no one has taken advantage of all of those properties together in a good way yet.
What are those properties?
1. Permissionless sales: no one can stop you buying or selling anything
2. Decentralized loss prevention: no need to trust a central party or give them money to avoid losses from buys or sells that go wrong
3. Buy and sell with privacy: what you buy and sell is your business and doesn't need to be attached to your identity
If those can be wrapped up in a user friendly package and then bootstrapped into a real marketplace, it will provide better ways to earn and spend Bitcoin which is good for users and speculators

Congratulations on getting a debit card. They have been able to do instant(\*real settlement finality after months) and free(\*void where merchant) transactions for a long time now.
Bitcoin is better than real money because real money is actually fake money and Bitcoin is the real money.
Bitcoin operates with no central authority or banks, reducing the risk of your counterpart betraying you. No one can close down your account for doing something they don't like.
Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. It's not a system of corrupt regulatory capture, it's an open system where people can voluntarily take part.
If people were only HODLing, then transactions would be quite cheap indeed. It is because Bitcoin has grown in transactional usage so much that demand for transaction space is at an all time high.

The problem is mostly about ethos, u/dryja is an expert in his field and a great contributor to Bitcoin but his world view is wrong. Look to Rusty's post on the reasons why a miner centric concept of Bitcoin doesn't make sense.
Not requiring a bit flip is of course easier for miners, and probably technically minimizing the chance for disruption. But the big picture is that we decide what Bitcoin is and not the miners, the more we bend over to accommodate the miners or accommodate non-validating nodes, the more we are saying that not-validating is OK and that miners must be accommodated or change cannot happen. 
This is maximizing local benefits at the cost of Bitcoin's future.

Even if it were a good idea, which it isn't, SegWit and a 2MB raise are not compatible plans

The network needs the bug fixes in SegWit to enable new and better applications and uses of Bitcoin, including better long term scaling solutions
The best case scenario for a 2mb bump would let people save a penny or two on their transactions
Core also does not control the block limit, the entire network consensus controls it, and all other consensus variables, like the coin limit. Core can't change the coin limit any more than they can change the block limit

Trouble is, Nintendo doesn't want you reselling your games and even if they did they'd probably want to be middlemen in that transaction. Customers would have to demand it, seems unlikely in the case of Nintendo but it could be great for small publishers or Abandonware type people as long as you ignore that piracy is going to happen no matter what

People have been added and removed over time, the commit step is a formality that comes after discussion of the change. In the Bitcoin repo people don't just get to add things that they want or decide things just because they have the commit flag: they just follow up with the outcome of the preceding discussions and review. The process is outlined in the repository contributing document

Each channel is just two people, but there are multiple channels. It's still like 10 people for a month vs all the public for all of the future
So it's longer than the hours that a transaction can be floating out there before being confirmed, but it's still a pretty short time when compared with "forever", plus it has the benefit of being much more private

You are betting on one specific use case which has other solutions - it has to come true exactly in the way you predict or your bet fails. People could never use Bitcoin for large transfers, just for small transfers. Or they could use something in parallel to Bitcoin we haven't thought of yet. 
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, the inherent risk involved and the time frame probably required to see success mean you could invest in traditional investments with a better risk return ratio

Credit card companies are built on a laughable system where you basically give people the password to your account and ask them to please only take the appropriate amount
Well this is not secure and your money could get stolen so they have the idea of the chargeback 
Well chargebacks cost money, so they have to limit the damage somehow
If they just switched to a secure system that didn't share the core password (already starting to happen a tiny little bit with things like Apple Pay) this problem would go away for the most part

Some HD standards allow the use of passwords, actually even more powerfully because you can setup multiple passwords and use them as basically "fake outs" if someone demands you reveal the password, you can reveal one that has just a little bit of money there and not the one with the large amount of money

1. It will take many years before the block rewards are fully gone
2. Fees provide around $20k/day of security today, it's hoped that will rise
3. Businesses who depend on the Blockchain being secure could potentially work together to promote its security, although you might see tragedy of the commons problems
4. The coin limit could be raised a small amount to provide for security, although this is a very bad option because it hurts the trust in the coin scarcity
5. People could just accept lower security, we are talking about security over time, energy spent over time, so people could just wait a longer time to have the same final security they had when the hash rate was higher

It's hard to imagine the Internet getting segmented airtight.  It would have to be a country deliberately and totally cutting itself off from the rest of the world.

I am concerned, but not horrified, but I would like to advise not taking Reddit 100% seriously.
We are stuck between a rock and a hard place here. BitMain has forced this through criminally irresponsible behavior: putting backdoors in their software, sponsoring closed source versions of the Bitcoin consensus code, encouraging people to switch to exploit ridden nodes, telling people they can't run full nodes, patenting methods to get huge mining advantages, going around to Bitcoin companies and threatening them with attack if they do not support BitMain, throwing money around at companies and making secret backroom deals to support BitMain.
This is our current context. I'm horrified by what is going on with mining. This needs to stop. Blaming UASF for instability is blaming the victim. We need to stop what is going on.
Would I prefer it were done in a neater, safer way? Yes. Do I think that people are backing the best plan yet? No. But I am inspired that people are willing to take action and not sit back and let the Bitcoin experiment die to the apathy of the people who were paralyzed by the pursuit of the perfect way to fight back. Sometimes even somewhat bad decisions are better than no decisions. I decide to UASF.

Semi trusted nodes is pretty vague, if the 51% miners also happen to agree with the guys you semi-trusted, you're in the same position as before.
If I'm a rich person and I want to use the blockchain to store all my family photos, and you just made it so I can buy up an 8gb block for $0.01 (current avg block costs $60, divided by 8000), why am I not going to just outbid all the "poor" people and use the whole block?
If you're a single client you don't know the difference between a "large number" of nodes and a "small number" of nodes because faking nodes is trivial. So you can't reliably base any logic on the number of nodes saying something.
It would not cost me a lot to set up a majority of nodes all around the world using fake nodes
Presenting and considering viewpoints is all well and good. But promoting falsehoods, demanding that other people change what they are doing or how they feel, those things aren't fair play. 
Look at how myopic "large blockists" are:  "I expect the decline of bitcoin to begin within 1.5 years. 20$ transactions and universal use of LN will be poison for adoption." A $20 bitcoin means a 200x rise in demand for blockchain space. 20,000% growth means the end of Bitcoin? There's just some simple logic that's being missed out here in the mob mentality that Mike &amp; Gavin are encouraging.

Here's the data showing present composition that:  - yes presently it sometimes touches 2 but does not go all the way there
But looking at the trend for script, you can see that more script is slowly being used over time, meaning the block size with segwit would grow over time 
Since it will also become cheaper to use more script, I expect that to be the favored composition. That's why this is a working estimate, it's based on a future composition of transactions

You could set up the spending pool funds so that they are pooled in a way where all must decide together to move the funds. When you setup the pool funds, sign but do not publish to the network a transaction that gives people back their funds proportionally. When you receive more funds or investors, repeat this process. If anyone wants to quit, they ask the group to let them out by making a transaction to cash them out and reform the group without them. If the group doesn't let them quit gracefully, they publish the reset transaction and cash everyone out.

Casual use for smaller payments to merchants is generally the idea behind client-mode, it wouldn't be used for high risk transactions like big payments or payments from untrusted people.
No one ever really built the client mode that Satoshi described, although there are some efforts to continue down that path. The big missing component is a warning that the consensus rules are broken and there is an invalid block. No one bothered to build warnings and many wallets like CoPay don't even bother with client-only mode and they just trust servers directly
I personally use Bitcoin in this client-only mode way, where I use my SPV wallet as only a client. But practically I am the exception

You could probably have a better case with the July 2015 forks, those were sort of hard forks, although in that case you would have to say they were hard forks but then they turned into a reorganization and the history of the hard fork was deleted, so it's like it never happened.
The 2013 fork was not deterministic, meaning there was no "old rules" or "new rules", just a or b. It was more like something was left unspecified and that caused a network split
The Blockchain is confusing because its history is designed go in both directions

You adjust the time basis of the settlement based on your analysis of that possibility.
Let's say you have a channel for $100 and the Bitcoin network can do 500k transactions per day. So you adjust your logic to say, if I can't get a transaction through in 7 days with a bid of up to $100, that means that the network is burning $18 billion per year in proof of work from fees alone, compared to the market cap and the current fee rate, that is unlikely.
This is similar logic to how you can accept any payment, "if the miners wanted to double spend me, they would have to spend $x to carry out the double spend".
Another way to improve the guarantee to allow for shorter time windows is to adjust the smart contract itself to analyze the fee market. If the fee market grew too high, the timeout window would be extended
Going beyond this, in many cases, payments are made between honest people. Even if the payment fails catastrophically, they may honor the payment even though they are not cryptographically compelled to

Wallets hold and generate private keys, which are used to sign transactions and create addresses to be used to receive funds
The signature part proves that you really own the private key, without revealing it. 
All transactions must be signed to prove that they are originating from their owners
The hardware wallet signs and sends the transaction without revealing to the external device what the private key is, keeping the funds secure from the external device, and letting you verify the transaction separately on the hardware wallet. The external device never gets the private key, so it can't change the destination of the funds, or make new spends.
Different hardware wallets work differently. I've outlined options for hardware wallets here:

The only savings is that it starts up faster and you could still be at risk of being attacked since you may have based your starting verification on bad data?

I couldn't recommend this to a person who just needed a spending wallet, because it offers nothing over SPV for spending purposes.

The best antidote to FUD is time and data and keeping people honest
It's so easy to spin nightmare scenarios or criticize the other guys, to create a big community outrage of constant repeat posting. That is an inexpensive move. 
Proof of Work doesn't just apply to Bitcoin, it applies to life. You don't trust a miner because he says he will mine or he has mined, you trust him because you see the proof yourself, right now.
Where is the proof of Brian Armstrong's "new dev team"? Does anyone think this "death spiral" FUD is realistic when we can see how miners and the price react today and they don't do anything like what is described?
In the meantime we have seen that the many claims of a new dev team are false, there's no proof of code. That the best hope they cling to of a dev team is to become more popular somehow with no devs that the devs all are forced to go against their beliefs and work for a team that they think is wrong.

Zero conf works as well now as it ever did. If zero confs were reliable, why would we even need mining? Now that developers are working on ways to have really reliable instant transactions, people are claiming that somehow the existing flows are sacrosanct, even in though they are unreliable and not very decentralized.
No one is in charge of Bitcoin, and you are just imagining any willful destruction of anything, which is why you have no proof for that or real motive why anyone would want to do that other than some speculation that makes no sense on the face of it. Anything that is happening to Bitcoin by definition is because people are wanting it to happen by downloading and running new software with new improvements. There's no auto-update, everyone is opting-in to every change.
Bitcoin doesn't work as is as a universal payment system. It was always going to need to be changed, it was always a work in progress. 
To remove fees would weaken or break Bitcoin because there would be no cost to spam, the network would be flooded with spam and it would be unusable. To remove block times would be to send orphan rates through the roof and thus the effective hash rate of the network and give centralized mining operations increased advantages, creating more central points of weakness. Those aspects of Bitcoin cannot be changed without huge tradeoffs, you can't just bury your head in the sand and say they don't matter

I think you should go more slowly, on a trial basis to prove real impact. I'm not sure about matching, I think the better method would be a "big splash" donation. Like, "if we could get 1500 people to donate $35 over three months that would make a big change: $50,000, could inspire more charities to open up to Bitcoin donation, or even inspire them to create a specific funding goal like distribute 10,000 books to children or some goal people could directly fund"
1. Setup a document that explains the entire process, and make donating or pulling back a donation if the timeout goes by super super easy and straightforward
2. No one who collects the BTC has the ability to steal it. They can only send it to the donation address
3. Require a funding goal to be met, otherwise all funds are returned! This is paying for a big splash. The collector of the BTC should cryptographically not be able to send unless the funding goal is met
4. Only donate to a proven charity, something everyone can verify, and only one of them at a time to make a big impact, and check with the charity first that it is cool with them
I recommend charities with a static donation address so people can verify for themselves

No, this is just hysteria.
The easy answer if you want the historical and symbolic significance preserved is simply to have two documents, an original and an updated version and link both.
There's no implication of removing the original from history, only an implication of offering a modernized version to be used when introducing people to the project.
Obviously the presentation of the new version should be shown in such a way that makes it clear that it is not the original and obviously the historical and symbolic version should still remain accessible as long as it serves the interest of educating people about Bitcoin. Any outsized reaction beyond those provisos is just hysteria.

Not a valid example, you aren't buying bitcoin there, you are depositing fiat.


Again, not a valid example, and you send the coins to LBC, but you don't trade with them


This sounds like an exception since you had to qualify it with "very high reputation", not "the overwhelming majority"

There's no profit without risk. There is more risk when buying before the half point, theoretically more reward if you think the market is efficient
Not much time left though
If you are just looking to buy in and cash out, to play the buy low sell high game, that's basically a sure loser mathematically speaking. Every winner in a commodity market must have a loser, except for the exchanges which make fees whether you win or lose

The thread is getting brigaded pretty hard right now, but I will take their side to some degree and say that there is no one size fits all answer to security. Waiting for 30 confirmations is certainly overkill in many situations, the obvious one being if you are sending from a Bitcoin Core node that you trust to your own SPV wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-29 03:23:43
Think about this as an analogy. If you are trading in gold, and there is a high risk that the gold could be fake and you could lose money, use a gold tester to confirm it is real gold.
If you are trading in Bitcoin, and there is a high risk that the Bitcoin could be fake and you could lose money, use a Bitcoin tester to confirm it is real Bitcoin. The best, most thorough tester on the market is a full node.

They store one key themselves and another which they say is encrypted with your password, using JavaScript in a webpage that they serve you. It's reasonable to expect that most users don't use a password that is appropriate for securing Bitcoin as their Coinbase password.

There is a short explanation at the top, but the basic idea is that width represents space usage. Vertical space and the brightness represents fee level going up to another bidding level.
The main reason for the vertical space usage is so that the fee labels have space to be displayed without running into each other.

Nothing really stops that, just the cost of the fees. It wouldn't shut anything down exactly, it would just make the network more expensive to use
There are some limits at the low end of fees that prevent too many "low end" fees from being relayed, which limits the problem of too many low fee transactions at once.

Everyone who has tried this has regretted it
Even normal goods and services aren't really tied to the dollar, they are tied to an abstract idea of value
Ever noticed that prices slowly go up or the amount that you get slowly goes down? Ever notice how grandpa says in his day he could buy a coffee for a nickel and he tied an onion to his belt?
It's all because of the exchange volatility of the dollar, which is much lower than Bitcoin and generally moving in an inflationary direction but still ever-present.
Basically no you should price your stuff at what it's worth to you to sell, unless there is a lot of demand in which case you should price it at what the market will bear

They are quite similar. For example, in this Coinbase case, imagine if they went against a sizable percentage of the user base and declared a new coin that they sponsored to be Bitcoin.
Some users might reasonably disagree and want to remove their deposited original Bitcoin. However Coinbase could say, "No, we have changed our understanding of what Bitcoin means and what you consider the original Bitcoin is in fact nothing".
So when you went to withdraw, they would not give you your deposits. In their current case of ETH, they are saying, "We do not support the original ETH, only the fork, and we will not honor the withdrawals of the original ETH, and we are in fact giving it away to people randomly because to us it is nothing".
The scenarios are so similar that many people who are proposing a hard fork for Bitcoin are now reexamining their proposals to try prevent issues such as replay attacks currently seen in ETH from occurring should there be a Bitcoin hard fork.

"Market cap" and "dominance" are useless because they use garbage data. 
The garbage is the number "coins outstanding". 
For premines, instamines, ICOs, it is an unknown number where the coin purveyor is strongly incentivized to create a false impression to inflate their "market cap" for advertising purposes.
Coins also pay exchanges to help them create fake volume numbers to bootstrap their credibility.
Garbage in, garbage out.

I don't look at average fee, but I do want to include fee estimates and to go from here and give a better a idea of the relationship between predictions like Bitcoin Core / Cointape and their historical results.
Previously I had started work on some higher level analysis that did look at aggregate information. 
However looking at the data at a lower level like this, I saw that the aggregate data I was collecting was going to be potentially misleading because of these weird things that happen. Like people put in super high fees that are obviously stupid. Any fee above $0.50 is just ludicrous: that's essentially always higher than even the top 1% of fee space. But people still regularly pay that.
Also with average fee, some miners are stuffing blocks full of zero fee transactions. Some transactions are huge, others are small. I see the average fee as too noisy from all this weird behavior to be meaningful about the focus here: "how much is it costing people to get a confirmation?"

That's why the best practice is to use well vetted open source software produced and reviewed by experts when you want to store and send your Bitcoin as securely as possible

So at the moment blocks are not full, plenty have space left 


Certainly no doubt over here


I don't know, statements can say anything they like? The miners are only the miners because the network says they are. If they go against the network, they won't be the miners for long. SegWit works better as a soft fork but it could easily be a hard fork instead and hard forks don't require miners because miners can't change consensus rules

Well you'd possibly be theoretically sending money that you may or may not have, you just don't have that information. The Core node gives you that information.

The median is 258 bytes, it's calculated over a lot of blocks. In general the normalized fees should just be thought of as estimates, aside from the Satoshi / Byte fee: which you can see by hovering over the fee, and you can click the fee for a representative transaction in that block
The USD prices are also only calculated over many blocks. The idea is to give a generalized sense of the total cost of a normal transaction, although I have been thinking about a purely Satoshi/Byte based visualization that would be more accurate but maybe less focused on the cost that a user would feel.

Why can't we complain about both? Coinbase leans into these regulations and fights improved privacy efforts. Even BitPay, another US company, has made a wallet where people can control their own private keys and BitPay does not monitor.

And what does Coinbase invest in? Altcoins? This is not about driving Bitcoin to success, it's about dollars in Coinbase's pockets

Yeah no. You know if you say things, you are just masturbating unless you actually justify them. Most Bitcoin transactions already occur off chain. It's not the end of the world, one fund transfer system cannot be all things to all people, accept it. 


This is an open source project not a company. It's job is to do the best it can do not stop others from doing well. I also don't buy your bogus claim that something novel happened in the past six months. Most transactions are not even using dynamic fees, let alone being priced out of the market.

Each node in the peer to peer network verifies everything itself
1. Miners may refuse to include transactions in their own blocks
1. Fifty one percent of miners (by hash-power) may stop forty nine percent of miners from adding blocks to the blockchain
They can't govern changes to the protocol
@_date: 2016-07-26 15:33:30
In the above example that you can see on the Eth chain, no valid tx would be necessary. All you'd need are split coins, which you might have and not even realize it. It wouldn't be a double spend, it wouldn't require a Sybil attack, etc. that example would require a hard fork though

Personally, I use Electrum - I think it's the best all around wallet
Recently there have been some unsettling moves by miners and companies in the Bitcoin space that have drastically reduced my trust in them. For that reason, I also use Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 - only for receiving funds. That's because it has the highest level of validation of any client: there is no need to trust the miners or companies if you use that client to receive. I then send the funds on to my Electrum client.
I also own a Trezor hardware wallet, but I find it a bit clunky and "v1-ish"

What about the node operators? How do you determine their costs? I think those are probably going to be much larger than the miner's costs
@_date: 2016-07-12 09:16:04
- Blocks are like individual files, and they must reference the last one
- Block solutions are hash signatures of the block data, double SHA256
- Generating random keys uses cryptographically secure random numbers, which is possible if done carefully. Some wallets like blockchain-info have messed this up in the past and people have lost money, so it's advisable to be cautious when selecting a wallet

It sounds like you are coming from the perspective of fiat currency, where sitting in fiat, even in the bank is a terrible idea because unlimited inflation will slowly take the entire amount you have saved.
In bitcoin this is not a problem, it's similar to owning gold, you don't "make your gold work for you" because you can just sit on it without it slowly disappearing.
However, there are two things you should be thinking about:
1. You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket
2. You should invest in things that produce real wealth: like companies when there is an opportunity, but not if the company has too much investment, which is often the case

Because nodes can be Sybil attacked, many nodes should be considered a single party. An example scenario can be seen in the current Classic split on the ETC chain.

You're throwing in non-sequiturs. A majority of hashing power may believe something that is in fact false.

What about competition? If fees go up too high, competing ways to send Bitcoin gain traction and fees go back down? Isn't this supposed to be the way to combat miners putting too-low soft limits or soft-forking the fee market?


Normally in markets having a feedback mechanism is a good thing. If traffic is slow, people are encouraged to send more transactions as fees lower. If traffic is heavy, people are encouraged to wait on their transactions until traffic is slower. That's kind of the idea of capitalism. Fixed fees are more like tickets and food lines, no way to prioritize.


Well I can tell you the type of transactions that will go away, ones where people don't want to pay the fees. Those type will go away first, more and more until we get to people who really need to pay the fees.
That's why I like the idea of micro-transaction networks as a direct solution. Bitcoin isn't going to support micro-transactions any time soon, so demand will be enduring, and if pressure on the macro-transaction side gets too high it can find some release in the micro-transaction networks until we can pull it back into the Blockchain.

Hey, if you proxy to a trusted source in a secure way, SPV is secure. I think I've also said that above, and I myself use SPV in such a configuration. My trusted source is just my own full nodes. If you don't proxy to a trusted source, you run a risk. Security is about assessing risk and difficulty, about cost and benefit. My advisory to people is that a full node makes a best attempt to validate every single byte, whereas SPV skips that because the download and verification burden is too high.
@_date: 2016-07-04 17:53:39


This really shouldn't be the statement, the burden of proof should be that a 2mb HF is not a threat. We don't make moves because we don't have data, we make moves because we do.


Both of these analyses are equally soft, this is just a very complex problem. By increasing node cost though, we can see an obvious issue for some percentage of users, validating becomes too costly for them. It's like if you want to save an endangered species, arguing that we should start eating it because any animal we eat we tend to farm and keep alive. Well, there's some truth to that but that answer might not really be wholly satisfactory


I disagree with the more nodes is better idea. I want to see more diverse nodes. The point of having many decentralized nodes is to prevent a possibility of network shut down, to present no one head to chop off. Having companies running all the heads instead of users, it is worrying to me

The transaction is three times the size of a normal transaction, so it's more like $0.04
Stop using blockchain-info and you will have less problems. You can see by the size of the transaction, they are not even multiplying the fee times the size of the transaction: something that has been standard for years and years. Address re-use that blockchain-info encourages also makes the fee much higher
@_date: 2016-07-11 11:18:51


This is circular reasoning. The validation is to stop the miners cheating in the first place. The less you validate, the more likely it is that a cheat will occur. The scenario in which they cheat is also called a "hard fork", and it is quite possible: they have threatened it.


Yeah startup time is faster, but you never reach the finish line, so why bother really?


Any client might be misled with a sybil attack


This is an interesting benefit, although it's kind of unrelated to the "fast start" feature, it's just a feature of a normal node. That's why I do like this idea if it is combined with a real full node eventually.

This is why validating full nodes are important. With people validating, the issue goes away
No one should be receiving payments on non-validating clients.
On the real network, this kind of a split has happened multiple times. But miners lose money (testnet coins have no value), on whichever side eventually goes away (hopefully the rollback side). The security of Bitcoin depends on miners not wanting to lose money, the security of non-validating clients much much more so.

Yes both low fees and low node costs are important. Full node costs are variable, if we had had 10mb blocks we might be looking at a 1 terabyte download for a new user or a re-scan, pretty annoying! Already the 80gb download is a cost I think people are upset about paying, I used to tell new users that they should stay away from a full node because of this.
I'm a merchant: $0.20 fees as a flat fee for a small payment is not unusual, for a sale of $1 on my store I pay $0.33 in credit card fees. And that is something where I carry chargeback risk, can be censored, etc. That's not for a perfect user experience either: I see people get their cards declined all the time for example.
The costs are separate though. People who are receiving transactions or we want running full nodes, they are not necessarily the same people making lots of transactions. Full nodes are only important for receiving transactions. Low transaction fees only apply to sending transactions, you can securely send Bitcoin without a full node.
I want Bitcoin to be low cost both to receive and to send. I also want the network to be sufficiently accessible and peer to peer that it can be resistant to a wide range of possible attacks. That for me protects the value of the coin: we know we can rely on this thing because it is small, battle tested, simple, widely distributed.

This old u/jgarzik quote will be interesting to revisit if they manage to keep their clown car together for the next few months:


Jeff Garzik has been against the basic principles of Bitcoin, against self-sovereign money from the start, seeking only to create a new "[PayPal-BTC]( system of centralized but global credits. That's ok, not everyone has to agree. It's only his lies about his so-called "open source" development process that reveal him as a bad actor, not his point of view or his patches.

OK that transaction is 30k, the normal transaction is 258 bytes, so already you are talking about a transaction that is over 100 times larger than a normal one
If you normalize its fee to what a standard sized transaction would pay, that transaction is paying around $0.04 - a "high fee" is around $0.09 - more than double
So your statement above is false
@_date: 2016-07-12 07:14:12
This is very far from true, there are many substitutes for on-chain transactions. Most transactions involving Bitcoin are not on-chain

If you can trust or must trust one of these gold agents to give you gold, why not have them also run the distributed ownership database? Is there a reason that doesn't make sense?
I see two potential ways the Blockchain could help:
1. Setup smart contracts with multisig and scripts: you could say that if the gold broker becomes uncooperative that after a time period your gold token alchemizes to Bitcoin (a penalty for uncooperative token providers)
2. A generalized, new master Merkle root for all data. Already we see the need for a second Merkle root with SegWit and up to 10% of block space is being sold to op-return data storage instead of payment transactions. Formalize the gold trading system and other systems integrity into a single global Merkle root that attests to other data system integrities. Opponents of this idea have said that it pollutes the incentives of miners, but I don't see any way to stop that anyhow

Well Hashers can look at what blocks are being produced, and then think about the opportunity cost of that space
I would say that the fee skipping seems to only cut off the low end of fees.
Except in one situation, which is where fee skipping is combined with empty quick-block. In this sample of 200, I have no examples so I didn't include this observation, but I have seen "empty" quick-blocks include many transactions that otherwise don't seem like they should have been included, to the exclusion of normal transactions. So they behave like empty blocks but they are still full.
In this case, the miner basically skips the queue of transactions and include other stuff. This would make sense if the pool had no time to validate external transactions, but knew that the internal transactions would not conflict so they did not present an orphan/invalid block risk.

Gavin co-founds the Bitcoin Foundation with Karpeles


He doesn't ask questions when the MMMGlobal Ponzi scheme is added as a Bitcoin Foundation Member


He [publicly vouches for Peter Vessenes]( as Chairman of the Foundation, who is accused of taking 20 grand, and has various other court cases pending, accused of taking 5 million from MTGox


He includes [Charlie Shrem]( as a founding member of the Bitcoin Foundation, who was later found to be coordinating with a darknet drug money launderer, with full knowledge


He attaches himself to the Bitcoin Unlimited project, and promotes Peter R's work, who is [accused of being a plagiarist]( on various occasions 


He [promotes the MyBitcoin service]( as where users of Bitcoin of the future will store their Bitcoins safely, the service later disappears with people's Bitcoins


He promotes the work of Mike Hearn, who later turns on Bitcoin and calls it "failed" and then does a press tour and blog posts slamming Bitcoin


So who does Gavin demand extraordinary proof of, demand that they leave Bitcoin, say they are destroying Bitcoin? Why [the Core]( [Devs]( (who have [actually saved Bitcoin from numerous real problems](
)). And the [Lightning Network]( guys. An interesting discrepancy. 
And Gavin's operating thesis at the moment is that the "no trust" / "trust only in math" foundation of Bitcoin [should be abandoned]( and that we [should not consider a situation in which a miner abuses this trust](




And [the actual Satoshi on matters of trust](

Aren't the payment processors already centralized? Everyone seems to go through BitPay and Coinbase, so isn't this a tautology: we already have this, so these guys will use LN, so they will also be in LN. LN seems neutral to this issue: merchants already route their money through BitPay / Coinbase


Given that the LN design is to create an open source peer to peer network, isn't there a gray area where people can run their own nodes and network if they don't want to go through the central points?

Lightning doesn't activate, it's another layer on top of Bitcoin. It could even be running today and we wouldn't necessarily know about it. The idea of second layer networks is that they are invisible to the Blockchain. This is a general problem, even with soft forks: people could always have transactions that depend on future Blockchain behavior that may change. 
That's why it's recommended you don't make things like funds locked for five years: in five years the chain may be so different you can't claim them.
Also it is pointed out that "safe hard fork procedures" are under specified, under researched, under developed. That is where the Ethereum hard fork went wrong, it was pushed out the door quickly and kept things simple, but too simple: exchanges like Coinbase suffered losses of funds. That's a pretty bad outcome for a hard fork, people losing money.

Bitcoin can't handle 2mb blocks without technical consequences, it's just like dropping a rock in the water: if you drop a bigger rock, you will get a bigger splash. That's the technical part.


Well maybe blocks won't even be at 100% at that point? They're still at around 75% or 80%. The fee is around $0.10 which doesn't seem too harsh to me


What market?


I think that's exactly what I'm saying. Like let's say you have a Bitcoin exchange, but you run out of funds due to a hack, and then you start saying, oh well, I will just use the profits and grow and grow and then eventually fix my "missing funds" problem. Well, that is basically fraud, and it is not a good strategy in my opinion. "missing decentralization" is the equivalent to "missing funds", you have a wag the dog situation. The purpose is a no-trust currency. That is the primary goal. You don't give that up for a secondary goal, which is "as valuable as possible". You never give that up.

Counterfeit bits are possible, but both systems rely upon a history of transactions and because they are digital, it's just pretty easy to check if the history doesn't check out. Like, "where did this money come from" is just some database lookups.

Yes, that is my ongoing attempt at documenting specific Bitcoin subjects
@_date: 2016-07-26 09:42:25
Yes, "if you don't hold it: you don't own it" has a lot of truth to it. There is some middle ground of ownership where you can be diluted and not realize it. And people discount that middle ground, so it is an easy place for rent-seeking people to abuse people's naive discounting of that and take money from there.
However I don't think fighting ETFs is the right way, I would say the real bogeyman is people not holding their own keys - like Coinbase owning 10% of all Bitcoin, or not validating their own funds - using a non validating wallet.
I'd say, "if you don't verify your funds, you don't own them" should apply to. If you receive funds to Breadwallet instead of Bitcoin Core, you aren't really receiving those funds, you are trusting the miners' version of history and the version of history of whatever random nodes you connect to. They could easily lie to you and take money from that, in a similar way that gold numbers get inflated but gold vaults reassure you that you really own those bars, even though the claims outnumber the holdings.
That's one reason I favor easy access for people to validate their own funds

I wouldn't take the payment down though because it probably doesn't cost you anything, and it's a vote for a world in which you don't have to hand over a percentage of every sale to a banker who did next to nothing
@_date: 2016-07-15 06:13:44
You should always be prepared to wait hours for a transaction due to random chance: confirmations can take hours to appear if miners get unlucky 
If time is very sensitive the only solution is to use something like green address or bitgo which give instant confirms, or payment channels which do the same thing 
Of course that randomness works in your favor sometimes when they find blocks very quickly

To correct the record for u/_chjj Christopher Jefferey, he says he decided to write his "SegWit coin theft patch" and his "help Bitmain covert ASICBOOST patch" and work on Core block censoring software by himself and it's totally a coincidence that Jihan Wu gave him (unspecified) amounts of money and it is a coincidence he went to China to conspire with Jihan Wu before releasing his patch that he coincidentally forgot to publish to any open source repository or tell any of the active developers about.

Horizontal space reflects the space used in the block. Wider == more bytes used.
Vertical space increases by 1 level for every increased fee level. The reason for this leveling is so that I'm able to show the cost of each level without overlapping the other level :/ It could be confusing though, maybe I can solve that problem another way, like with hovering
Interesting feedback on the "empty" bar, I guess this is confusing
Showing the list of transactions instead of just the "low bid" transaction would be interesting, I agree, time to get a real database, unless an existing block explorer can show a range for me :D 
What would the median line mean, like the median fee used in the block?
@_date: 2016-07-09 10:09:40
Well there is the Segregated Witness BIPs but they are pretty technical
- 
- 
And the transaction types: 
Basically there are various types and configurations of Bitcoin transactions, and the new block will give a different weighting to the different types.
So there can be like 1.6 mb of the highest weighted transaction type and 4mb of the lowest weighted transaction type. In practice, given the current trends of transaction types it should be around 2mb when fully rolled out.
You can still think about the 1mb, because it is the basis of the weighting. The non-witness stuff will still have to be represented in the new block, with no more than 1mb of space used, so that the new blocks can still be backwards compatible with the old blocks.
There is some reference that explains the weighting of every different transaction type, but I can't find the link at the moment...
But here is a plot of the existing historical transactions, which over time approach an average size of 600 bytes per transaction: 
If these same transactions were using SegWit instead, here is a plot of how they would be weighted:  - they approach an average size of 300 bytes per transaction instead (this is from the perspective of a legacy node, the SegWit nodes would still have these transactions as their original sizes, but from a weighting perspective the byte limit still applies).
The difference towards the ends approaches around a 1.8 mb block size when filled, but this chart is a bit out of date, with newer data from the past 6 months, it starts to approach around 1.9mb. You can see that as the mix of transaction types changes, the average weighted size also changes.
From the perspective of a legacy node, even a 4mb block would appear as a 1mb block to them

I guess you didn't notice that this is a direct quote from Hal Finney, the first person to ever receive a Bitcoin transaction on the chain. This post was from 2010. Who was he arguing with, Satoshi?
You can have on-chain or peer to peer, but not both. Everyone validating everything does not scale, that's just the mathematical reality
Here's another quote for you


Guess who said this one
Bitcoin can scale somewhat on-chain, but if not done cautiously with real development vigor and an appreciation for decentralization and security, it is a recipe for disaster

I think it was labelled 1.3 by Satoshi for a while, but then Satoshi changed his mind because other people objected. In those early days, going to 1.3 might have been premature, there were still a lot of issues with the network. Remember in the early days, bugs like "oops we printed a billion coins" were happening, many DoS vulnerabilities, etc.

Here is how BIPs work: 
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:04:03
When you spend funds in Breadwallet, you are in fact spending funds that you own, as far as you know. The sending part is perfectly secure, you own the keys, you sign your signatures.
It's when you receive funds in Breadwallet, you are just taking someone else's word for it that you got those funds. If that person is not telling you the truth, they could be fake funds, just like if you had gotten fake gold and the person assured you it was real gold. You aren't touching it yourself, you aren't taking possession of it yourself, with Breadwallet you are trusting a third party to tell you that your gold/Bitcoin is really there, don't worry.
So the equivalent to taking possession of Bitcoin/gold is to use a fully validating node that **trusts no third party data at all**. Every byte is checked. That's the equivalent of looking at, holding, testing your gold to know you really have it. From then on, you can forward it to Breadwallet for spending, because you can trust yourself to send to yourself. But receiving, you can't use Breadwallet and really know you have the funds you think you do.

You need OP_HAS_MANY_COINS for this one, you can't do that
However, here is how you could do it:
# Deadline: August 10, Pay 100 Bitcoins to Target Cause 
1. Curator P announces that he will take supporting funds into a multisig with you and him, each multisig has a timeout exception where the funds revert back to your single sig, but before the timeout he and you can spend funds together.
2. You deposit funds into Curator P's multisig address
3. Curator P creates an ANYONE_CAN_PAY transaction and adds funds from the multisig into the transaction. The transaction is only valid if 100 bitcoins is reached.
4. You and he sign the transaction, but it cannot be broadcast because it has not reached 100 bitcoins
Eventually Curator P gets enough funds on his transaction for it to be valid. He broadcasts it, the project is funded. Or... Curator P goes away, after Deadline T then the multisigs revert to single sigs, people take their money back. 
Curator P cannot change the ANYONE_CAN_PAY transaction target address, and he cannot broadcast it without the full funding amount, and he cannot move funds from your shared multisig without your signature.
People cannot back out before the deadline, because it requires his signature.

Look at Jonas Schnelli commits on github/bitcoin - 
Not sure I really agree with this UI decision, but I'm not the one doing it. You just toggle on and off RBF support on your transaction in the GUI like this
Then maybe you got stuck, and your transaction is sitting with ?? in the transaction list, so you right click it
Then it allows for a fee bump, which I guess is based on the relay fee, it doesn't appear to let you change it

- only the first gets rewarded
- transaction times are retargeted every two weeks to hit ten minutes

This isn't how markets work. Lines appear more with fixed prices than they do with dynamic prices. Just look at gas rationing, Soviet bread lines, etc.
Obviously in both cases, we are talking about a fixed limit, so the equal size of transactions are serviced. So the difference is in one case, the price warns people away, the other the long lines do. The lines method is strictly less efficient, it over allocates supply to people who don't care as much, and under allocates supply to people who care more, that's just the definition of a fixed rate system. If you care about people getting a price commensurate with what they feel their transactions are worth, fixed fees are strictly worse, so we should all wish for an end to bread lines because it is an unhealthy and inefficient way to do things


I think that's a balance, and it's a difficult one because it can potentially come down to power dynamics: can we force cost externalities on others like node operators because we have the power to do that? I think people who use power dynamics like that should be careful though, if you live by the sword you die by the sword, eventually the power dynamic will not favor you and you will ask yourself why you even got into this system.
That's why I favor thinking about this kind of question along the lines of a mission, are we being genuine in the goals of the mission or are we just playing power games? If it's just a power game then are we playing hot potato with the value tokens because that structure is unstable? That's why I think playing temporary power games is essentially fraud, like a Ponzi scheme where eventually you will run out of people to shove later costs onto.


Technical problems trump economic problems when technical issues are physics and economic problems are psychology. Technical limits define the boundaries of what is possible, ignoring them is what you can see altcoins do when they promise things like privacy, fast blocks, all of these other things that they just say and don't actually deliver. It goes back to being genuine and following the mission, not just trying to win at all costs to find suckers or hope to undo lies later. Thats what people like Roger Ver propose, to make a Bitcoin that is just paypal2 and scales ok because it's just PayPal but then we later fix it so that it is decentralized again. That's nothing I want to be a part of and it won't work anyway, the greater suckers strategy always falls apart

They can't do that this easily because of how their wallet works, it's not a normal Ethereum wallet, it's custom made for security purposes.
I'm just restating what they have stated, they will not credit you with your ETC. It is not supported. **This is what they have stated**. Only the ETC from before a certain date is locked to holders before that date.
They certainly have lost ETC if you look at reports of successful draining attacks. If you don't believe me, it's fine, but take care to read into this cautiously if you are depositing on their exchange. Just follow what they say: do not deposit ETC.

Strange that they don't object to the DAO and Ethereum Heist Fork
In the DAO disaster, Vitalik and the Ethereum foundation first told the exchanges to shut down trading, which they did

Vitalik and the Ethereum foundation directly contacted miners and exchanges and told them not to support the original chain

Full nodes clients vs lite SPV clients are much more resource intensive, but offer better privacy characteristics and the option to participate in consensus of bitcoins fundamental parameters. 
Even at Visa levels, a current broadband connection and PC could download and process all transactions since they are fairly small, but it would take a good chunk of bandwidth and compute time, for now the network is kept to its main purpose which is to facilitate meaningful transactions
Miners include transactions to get fees, they can run a full node to know about those transactions to get the fees, but the exact setup is pretty modular and even including any transactions is optional

No it doesn't. Here's an example: for certain large transactions, signature-hashing scales quadratically rather than linearly. Even increasing above 1mb could be dangerous for that reason.

If you define attacker as someone who doesn't exist, then naturally they won't exist. If your perspective is that Bitcoin is one thing, then miners who disagree and mine another thing on the same PoW, they are attackers.
If you are looking for confusion about which funds exist on which blockchain, just check out the ETH/ETC forums for plenty of examples for this scenario playing out in real life, right now.
A strong defense is best deterrent to attack. This is also part of why full validation is recommended, for herd protection, to help proactively resist an attack rather than have to reactively respond to one. It's similar to why many people should take vaccines even though their chance of getting a rare illness is in fact quite small.

The only non technological reason to keep a limit is to prevent an unlimited supply of block space from making the price of a transaction essentially free. The security of proof of work comes from paying the miners, we need someone to pay for the energy consumption

If you've already sent property to someone untrusted before you received BTC, there's no software that can do anything to help you.
I can show you real world examples where the confirmations were in fact fake and thus worthless, but undetectable by an SPV client, but that should not be how you determine your own security to begin with. You don't start locking your front door after someone walks in and takes something, you lock it as a general practice.

The customers are the full nodes, and the product is decentralized, no trust money. So yes, preventing massive UTXO bloat that forces full nodes into server farms? That is serving the customers.


The whole point is avoid counter-party risk and trust and instead use cryptography to not require middlemen. Here is some reading for you that explains this:
[At some point I became convinced there was a way to do this without any trust required at all and couldn't resist to keep thinking about it.  Much more of the work was designing than coding.](
[everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust](
[With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.](
[I think this is the first time we're trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.](

Fees depend on size of the transaction data, not on the amount of BTC. If it has to bundle a lot of data from previous transactions together, that increases the size and thus the total fee.
If you are moving $11,000+, paying $6 doesn't sound too bad to me: that's not even 0.1% of the amount: I would just pay it

A lot of division? That's kind of a relative term. I think there is probably an order of magnitude between the smallest and the largest in terms of Core Dev's estimations.
I think a lot of Core people are already uncomfortable with the current level of centralization, particularly around mining pools, so that kind of looms large in their minds as a problem they don't want to contribute to.
Funny, it feels to me like naivety and optimism vs scientific thoroughness and a security mindset.
I mean you can say it from both sides, "these guys think we will be popular and we will never lose to an altcoin, so they don't want to cut any corners that we might need to cut". Or the other side, "these guys think that we will be decentralized and we will never die like the other centralized currencies, so they don't want to spend any time doing the work to keep things decentralized".
That's why I think balance is the right way, communication and cooperation and not destructive back and forth polarization

Bad economics lessons from professor Zander. Bitcoin has value for a million reasons. One of them is payments, which it is currently rarely convenient for due to long block times, fiat conversion costs, privacy issues and many other reasons. There are many many others. The principle reason Bitcoin has value is that it can do things that other currencies can't. That's why almost everything has value, they can do things other things can't. I already have a million ways to make payments. I don't have a million ways to keep my money on a decentralized system without counter-party trust and only using cryptography. So things like this are why Bitcoin has value.


Go up to the average person and ask them if they give a shit about whether their transaction is on the Blockchain. If it works, it works, only the psychotically obsessed are devoted to doing something a certain way and no others are allowed.


Oh yes, the sign of professionalism is taking shots at people. Show me where on this release history that improvement of the peer to peer network slowed down please:  - here is a hint, it didn't, although some people did quit working on it in a very public way.


Not sure if he ever heard that not everything scales linearly. You can't just take an algorithm and say, ok it did it in 5 seconds, guess if I grow the database by 1000 it will scale in 5000 seconds? No, that's not how this works.
I shudder to think about growing the UTXO set by 100 million transactions a day, Core is addressing this in SegWit to some degree but we need to make sure that you don't need a set of super servers to sync the blockchain.


Evidence number one of how disconnected from reality this story is


Pruning doesn't work in that suggested configuration, not as it stands right now


Optimistic mining is Orwellian-speak for "validation-less mining". the empty blocks it's mining on top, they are potentially invalid blocks if the preceding block is not valid. We've already had a chain of six of these validation-less fake blocks happen on the network


50 million transactions a day, in five years. With 1MB today we have around 200k daily transactions. So Zander proposes increasing block size 250x in 5 years. The Blockchain requires 50gb of initial downloading extra per year. This would make that 13 terabytes per year. 


Incentivized nodes, instantly secure confirms, micro-payments, improved privacy, maintained decentralized peer to peer network without need for centralized heavy servers, those are not needs?
This literally argues for no progress and to just stop validating yourself and trust your Church. This is kind of like the anti-vaccination crowd, the hate for science cannot be countered with more science, because it is just disregarded.

A lot of what Bitcoin is cannot have fatal flaws, just maybe bugs that can be fixed, because the basics of what it is just flow logically from its design. It's kind of like asking what if someone had a time machine and went back with an ASIC, would they be able to 51% attack forever? That would be kind of a silly premise
If I just accept that for some reason I would no longer be able to use Bitcoin because something or other, I'd either go back to fiat but try to minimize my use of it and invest in assets that I found worthwhile, or I would look for another project that shared in the ideals of a neutral, predictable, decentralized system of money, probably the one that had the most traction and represented those values. I'm not sure that project would be able to really exist until Bitcoin was no longer an option

Not sure what that means?
Ok there are two problems with full blocks:
1. People use dumb wallets that don't select appropriate fees, their transactions get stuck. This can happen with non-full blocks too, but it is much more aggravated by full blocks.
2. People paying appropriate fees for their transactions start to see higher prices as they compete. 
In problem  a potential solution would be to get people to upgrade to dynamic fee wallets, much less need then to avoid full blocks as a workaround for dumb wallets
In problem  there is no solution, this is the best we can do aside from off-chain solutions: people paying appropriate fee for their block space. But since the harm of problem  is higher fees, shouldn't we also focus on getting people who are already paying too high of a fee to pay less, just by upgrading their software?

The other signer, meaning the miners. But to falsely smear good-faith contributors - even people cited directly in the Satoshi white paper, never miss an opportunity would you. I mean after calling core devs autistics, and creating faked data about transaction delays to spread to the press to claim that Bitcoin was broken, you never miss a trick.
@_date: 2016-07-14 12:53:52
No, wallets hide this complexity from you but when you spend Bitcoin you are actually just weaving together past payments you've received into a new send. So if you've received lots of small payments, the cost to send those many payments is higher than if you had received one large equivalent payment, because the transaction size is bigger due to the complexity of describing what you are doing

No, that's not how LN works. The old transactions are discarded


It's a butchering because in some situations a large transaction might be necessary, and we already have a real fix for that particular issue that doesn't require a hard cap on transaction size. It's like people proposing amputating a leg when antibiotics would solve the issue.
Here is an example of the exponential cost. The 50 million daily active users, all verifying each other: well they require a collective download of 650 exabytes of data. To give you an idea of how much that would cost, here is what Amazon Web Services would bill for it at their cheapest rate: $31,500,000,000


$0.05 isn't dust - and dust is still part of the UTXO set.
Let's say that 50 million people are making an average of 100bytes of new UTXO per day, so 5gb per day of UTXO addition RAM needed per day. This comes out of your RAM. RAM costs about $4/gig. 5 years ago RAM cost about $5.50/gig. Let's be generous and say in 5 years RAM is $2/gig, now you want people to pay $10/day in RAM costs?


It will still cause the problem because there is no more signaling in the headers what soft forks are enforced. You are just flying blind by going off the headers, because you have no idea if the block you are building on is valid or not, you didn't even download the data so you have no logical way of knowing if you are building a fake block


No, they are only signaled during the activation period and after that they are no longer signaled


OK so you agree with me that increasing the cost of a full node by 250x is insane. I accept your apology.


Who will be willing to accept a bunch of expensive SPV clients leeching off of them when their costs go up 250x?
Already the centralized server wallets you mention as "only" include: Mycelium / CoPay / Electrum / AirBits / GreenAddress / Coinomi / Coin.Space / BitGo. The major SPV clients are in fact the minority: Breadwallet, Schildbach Wallet, Bither, Multibit are the only ones who support SPV. Bitcoin Core is already taking steps to help node operators deny service to SPV clients.
@_date: 2016-07-21 09:32:54
By median, do you mean like a vertical line right at the middle of each block? The median of which value-set?
I'm already using the median of a transaction size in the price estimate, so the median is already reflected in the price you will see at the middle.
I'm not sure I can do a better job of "fee estimating" than the many other sites out there that are already good at that, although maybe it could be helpful to really see what a fee means exactly. I see many people say, "There is a $0.10 fee", and this implies some don't understand that $0.10 is a value that gives a high confidence of being in the next half hour, versus the many lower fee levels that will also be confirmed in the next hour or two.
Labelling the Y axis, it may help illustrate that the Y value is just linear by fee bucket, I like that idea
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:58:42


There are many ways to use Bitcoin without the Blockchain. For example yes the LN network can make a million payments before it needs to settle to the Blockchain


That is not a fix, it's a butchering. This is just one example of where the scaling falls down. If you look at the entire system scalability, it has an exponential scalability characteristic


There's no way to mathematically link those except on an upper bound. You're talking about half a terabyte of RAM for UTXO - goodbye decentralization


If you don't validate the previous block, it is validation-less mining, even if you validate part of the block


We don't signal active soft forks in headers anymore, so it would still happen. Signaling is also very often faked.


Much less than 20TB per year
I see people spooked every day by the idea that they have to download 80gb to get started with a full node. Now tell them that it's 32 TB to get started? You are joking if you think I would support that to save some cheap people a few pennies.
When you talk about the Block size, you should also think about your precious non-validating clients. For indexed full nodes that need to blow up the block size into indexes to serve light clients, they would need to start supporting 60 TB databases. A baseline server has around a 60 GB SSD.

You've left the way that the hash function is broken vague, so that could be a tautological question. ASICs won't work if SHA256 is meaningless, but they would still work if SHA256 had any meaning left

This is accurate, that's what I said, the version Satoshi wrote is not touchable. The proposal to write a new white paper doesn't mean touching the old one, it means writing a new one based on the old one.
Also, by the terms of the license of the old one, it must be referenced. And it should be in any case.

Yes it by itself is only a short term solution, however it includes some bug fixes that would help in various longer term solutions:
1. It fixes problems with payment channels to allow for payment channel relationships that will reduce stress on the blockchain
2. It fixes problems with maliciously crafted transactions that can create DOS attacks on the Bitcoin network when they are spammed in very large numbers, which can happen if the block size limit allows for lots of them
3. It introduces a upgrade pathway for improved script signature algorithms that are 75% and 50% smaller in byte usage, leading to an effective 3mb or so block size, without even the higher bandwidth requirement and without even a hard fork. Theoretically we may even be able to get to an effective 4mb without a hard fork, although a hard fork may turn out to be the better way to increase capacity.

'soft forks are just trust in miners'
This would mean that P2SH would be not as trustless as P2PKH - **bullshit**
'soft forks reduce the security of bitcoin' 'soft forks are not opt-in' **bullshit** -- every feature upgrade ever done in bitcoin has been via soft fork, it does not reduce the security because you have a full network worth of nodes validating the new rules and soft forks like segwit are setup so that you have to deliberately opt-in to it by giving out a segwit address
'hard forks are the safe path' - **bullshit** -- tell this to the people who lost tons of of money on the etc/eth hard fork replay attacks
'this was the original path suggested by Satoshi' - **bullshit** -- he rolled out changes, like the block size limit, via soft forks
u/jgarzik is someone who wants to use FUD to promote his agenda. He's against the basic idea of cryptoanarchy/B-Money that Bitcoin is an implementation of, he has lobbied to stop smart contracts and he has worked to reduce the privacy of Bitcoin users without their permission

Antpool is still ignoring priority transactions, just check out their recent blocks. This makes for a weaker user experience where a user pays for a priority transaction and does not get in.


This is also a random variable. Tell me what the cost is precisely? You can't, because you don't know. If you look at the data, orphan rates have actually gone down as block sizes have increased dramatically.


Some miners skip validation and make potentially invalid blocks, a potential waste of hash power and thus a lessening of the security of the network. To reduce their potential damage and chance of loss of block subsidy, they lower their number of transactions to avoid any potential overlap conflicts.
We saw this in practice last year, when a number of blocks were thrown away due to miners not validating. This represents wasted power, lowered security, and a confusing user experience where confirmations are not actually confirmations.

There's no real way to figure out the real longest chain without a full node, if there is a split in what miners are doing, it will go back and forth as each side claims the most PoW and any non full node will get confused. Testnet has special code to make the PoW even less meaningful

It could be just as you say, rewards have been cut in half: losing over a million dollars in mining reward value per day may have some impact.

We may also be beginning to hit diminishing returns for technology improvements in ASICs, this year it seems like the exponential curve of hash power efficiency is beginning to flatten

The protocol is just what people decide to use though. They will always have the option, because it is just open source code that anyone can install. So you need others to not choose that option if you want it to go away


It seems extreme to me, none of the active developers seem to agree, and you can't seem to state a reason, just a feeling. And this is an option you want to take away from me, an option that I value, so you want to hurt my experience of Bitcoin, which seems like an extremist view

The miners are rewarded by all holders of Bitcoin, the value of the coins get diluted by increasing the supply. The full nodes peer to peer network allows them to do this on a limited basis
Miners don't need to verify, they just need to provably expend energy
The available Bitcoin number is inflating, but the inflation rate is exponentially decreasing
If two miners find the proof of work at the same time, they must race each other and the others in the network will accept the first they see. Then they must wait for the next block to resolve the conflict
@_date: 2016-07-04 09:17:13


Actually if miners don't act in their own interest we have bigger issues. They already aren't acting in the best interest of Bitcoin, that's what those zero-tx blocks are. They could just hold on a little longer to publish tx in those blocks, but then they threaten their earnings a little bit so they say "got mine jack". It's OK because this doesn't really break anything, but it's in their interest, not the interest of Bitcoin
Miners are in control of size within a limit, that's kind of the meaning of a limit. It's silly to consider the size scientifically because of the variance in what a few miners will decide, which will blow up any model that depends on size and not limit.
The only mathematical variable is the limit, the size is just a semi-random value within the limit.

Yes that is correct, that is out of scope of what full validation is useful for. We don't currently have any software defense against the scenario you describe. I'm addressing a different point which is that full validation defends against other attack scenarios, scenarios that SPV clients do not defend against. The highest level of security against those attacks is a full node. It's OK to disagree about the judgement of what risk is acceptable, and voice your opinion about what risk is acceptable, as long as everyone can make their own determination based on a common set of facts.

It would be quite unlikely to stay at 10% for the entire 140 days, value would start to split between the two chains and the block market values would shift the percentage up or down as miners followed value.
The wildcard is that BitMain says publicly they don't care about block reward value, which is very troubling for the basic concept of proof of work, but also proves why a UASF is such a critically needed step to improve Bitcoin.

However, that's different from storing your savings there, which exposes you to an unnecessary counter-party risk.

All the markets keep bitcoin up to varying degrees
Illegal trade by itself isn't the biggest market or factor behind bitcoin's price, and it is even somewhat of a drag considering illegal trade draws a target on bitcoin for regulation
One big issue with the illegal market is that things are still dollars, bitcoin is just a transmission system. This means money enters the system to buy drugs at retail but it also leaves the system on the supply side

Lucky for Gavin the KKK didn't sign up


Ridiculous, questions were already raised, that's why my quote has Gavin defending him


You can't see that calling something an official sounding "Bitcoin Foundation" and then meanwhile dealing directly (illegally) with people in the drug trade, it's not that great for Bitcoin? Also from my personal experience with BitInstant, it was run like crap, they would just give me random amounts of Bitcoin in exchange for my USD, and I'd have to harass their support for ages to even get my coins.


The topic was plagiarism. There's a guy going around saying "I'm making a scientific journal for all the Bitcoin smarties to publish papers". But at the same time none of the actual respected Bitcoin minds believe this guy knows what he's talking about, instead they say he's passing off their stuff as his own. And he's actively insulting them. It's a joke


Custodial wallets are a bad idea, then, and now. If you know about Bitcoin do you have to be a genius to figure out that leaving a bunch of unregulated and untraceable money with some random unknown person and asking them to please not steal it is a bad idea? We're talking about naivety here


Gavin himself says he disagrees with Mike's views and tone. I disagree with the lies he told the press, and anyone who would listen, that Bitcoin is broken. That's totally disrespectful 


Yeah that's not what he said at all


So you believe that this is Satoshi?
The amount of rationalization you have to go through to explain away everything is pretty telling though. You can't even admit that Gavin made a single error in judgement? Hmm.

A new chain is created that uses the same pow and normally the same rules, but the attackers coins are seized and given to other people.

Segregated Witness was merged into the master codebase, and will be part of 0.13.0 codebase which now has a release candidate: you can help with the release by downloading the RC and trying it out to see if there are any issues.
However because of the policy that soft forks are optional and major releases shouldn't include optional features, Segregated Witness will not activate in 0.13.0 and a subsequent version will include the activation logic.

The network will get partitioned and there will be two networks.
If someone sets up bridge nodes they will be able to bridge the two mempools together by selectively broadcasting across the networks.
Some transactions will only be valid on different sides and eventually that would potentially be all transactions as the networks separate out.
In my humble opinion, August 1st would not be a terribly impactful event and it won't really matter what happens to the mempool. Either the network as a whole will choose to upgrade to SegWit or only a small minority will choose to pursue the chain split effort. Either way, it wouldn't be much going on for most people to care about.

1. You went after me personally. I find that ridiculous, and not worth responding to. I prefer to keep discussion to the facts and not answer personal attacks that are not relevant to the matter of discussion.
2. You promoted your co-worker as "having a well known reputation", as if you were a neutral party, when in fact you have a working relationship.
I think it speaks volumes that you go after people who seek to warn people about risks, and that you are so incredibly resistant to the simple request that when you are promoting your technology, you disclose to people that it is your own.

ASICs are more efficient because they provide only one option, the reason they are so fast is tightly coupled to the reason that they can't do anything else.
It's like having a maze vs a straight path. It's much faster to go on the straight path, but the maze provides more options for your route. An ASIC only has one route, more generalized computing devices have many routes

I think the URL is a bit orthogonal, the real question is can we have a better white paper to point new people to for the purposes of getting an accurate idea of the system as it is today?
As far as urls go, they should serve user goals, so the big reason to keep it pointing at the original white paper would be to remain backwards compatible with all the existing references to the website, even though maybe they should really be re-hosting the pdf if they want an immutable version

The proof that they required doesn't seem to be overly rigorous. I think it's clear that they are "open minded" to a fault. Bitcoin already selects for people who are willing to entertain crazy ideas, and early Bitcoin must have been even more so. 


In my recollection, there was always an unhinged "mob" element to the community (if you define reddit or "personalities" as the community, which is tempting but I feel erroneous). The lack of a power structure in Bitcoin leaves a vacuum, and the kind of people who fill power vacuums are very often the worst possible choices for their positions
There is already some clear public evidence who is behind the specific actions like the bots and sockpuppets, etc. Roger Ver's forum composed a "enemy hit list", shortly after the bot actions began, with a very high correlation with this list.
I privately know through other means that threats and underhanded actions against me have come from people who are public names active in the Bitcoin XT / Classic community. I also know privately of other elements in that community who have been committing serious crimes, and who have secrets that they use as leverage against the Core devs. I wish that I could reveal those secrets, but they are damaging to both sides and to my mechanisms of discovery :(
I think the "campaign" element is an organized effort certainly, but one that is publicly visible: Gavin and the other usual suspects from the Bitcoin "Foundation" like Olivier, Mike Hearn, working on plans to alter/control the course of Bitcoin development however they can, over the course of many years. Your evidence is compelling that Craig is dedicated to some sort of attack, but not that he's part of this known leadership or a big part of their overall plans. 
If I had to guess, I would predict that "Craig is Satoshi" will blow over when he can't produce more evidence, and just linger as convenient "maybe" when he comes up with endless excuses of why he refuses to do so. There are plenty of people who believe Mike Hearn is Satoshi, or Gavin is Satoshi, not because of any evidence, but because it's convenient for their broken concept of Bitcoin

The trouble is that the kind of person who wants to abuse the dependance on ordering is the kind of person who will make themselves part of the 1%


RBF clearly marks the newer transaction as newer, and marks the older transaction as potentially having a newer one come along. I can't see any more that it could to do try and get the order right?


Exactly, we know because of the blockchain, which imposes a cost on getting the order wrong. That's what makes the blockchain work, but unconfirmed transactions or any offchain decentralized system has no cost to get the order wrong, so that's why you can't rely on the order not being wrong.

Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.
I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the "high-powered money" that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as... well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.

@_date: 2016-07-11 11:42:06


Hopefully, but you never know, maybe the nodes are doing a type of validation you don't agree with?


One man's cheating is another man's honesty. I think what Ethereum is doing is cheating, but some of them think it is honest: "because we can do it we should do it" type of reasoning
Another option is that dishonest people start realizing that validation is not happening and then use that as an angle to attack, claiming that the non validating nodes won't even notice so they willingly gave up their input. These type of people have already attempted similar things and they have made me wary of "reduced validation" solutions.


OK but my question is, why is it a good choice? There are an infinite number of possible choices to give, why is this a worthwhile one?


They have threatened to cheat in the past. They have in fact cheated in the past, they have double spent against merchants, they have made six invalid blocks in a row. These are random people, with random goals and desires. It is a real possibility that they don't behave predictably. Even machines without those variables go wrong sometimes, just due to entropy.

I think the fear here is that the AML KYC of exchanges will extend tendrils to BitPay and we will have two types of coins, KYC chained coins and normal coins
You also have to really really trust encryption here, which is reasonable but also scary. If Bitcoin cryptography breaks, there are graceful ways to deal with that: the real security is not based on cryptography but rather on basic math that can't break. If the cryptography protecting your private KYC data breaks, there is no putting that genie back into the bottle: once everyone knows you spend all your money on $embarassingThing there is no way to undo that.
That being said I like the idea of more user friendly and decentralized systems for identity pegging, there are just many dangerous paths to watch out for.

Well, we could change the design theoretically, but either the current design a minute would not be very good because of the speed of light issue. Although the block times average ten minutes, they are randomly spread out amongst a lot of times, so you need to also think about getting lots of blocks faster than the ten minute target
With one minute you'd start to see things like blocks coming just seconds apart. Realistically because of the speed of light that is going to be impossible to sync around the world in time. A realistic estimate for the fastest we can possibly communicate blocks around the world ever would be in the tenths of a second, that is the speed of light barrier. 
Each miner is working off of the direct results of the past miner, they are like runners carrying a baton that they have to pass off to each other. If there is no time for that pass to happen, you get a disruption in the system
In addition to the speed of light issue you have a problem where you have to wait for sufficient work to be proved. This is a system where we trust people who prove they did a bunch of work. You can't do much work in a few minutes. The recommendation for securely receiving funds with Bitcoin is one hour or six blocks, but whichever comes last, so the recommendation is at least an hour and maybe longer

It's funny that big block data that goes out and tries to answer challenges from small block reservations usually confirms those reservations.
 A lot of wallets are using dumb static fees. Dynamic fees have been the recommendation for two years now. How do we get people to switch to dynamic fees?
People using dumb fees makes things more expensive for the rest of us. I mean people have a perfect right to do it, but a more vibrant bidding market would result in paying a more accurate fee relative to the other people's priorities.

Yes, as far as the network is concerned you never sent anything right? So use that fact to your advantage and send the same coins again - the original spend will be discarded as a double spend
Normal clients won't let you do this, but if you export your private keys and import them into a new client, it won't even know about the other spend
Be careful though, there is a reason clients don't expose this functionality as you can shoot yourself in the foot if you aren't careful

There is a big difference between having the $3000 and having assets "worth" that.
Right now you still have as much BTC as you ever did, it's just that at this moment in time you could probably find a buyer who valued it at $3000.
But at a future moment in time you might not be able to, so it is not the same as $3000 which will always be valued at $3000
I'd tell that guy that bitcoin is a technology that can be useful for moving money around with very low fees, very quickly, and with a low public profile in comparison to traditional banking.
This does make it appealing for drugs, but there are many purposes it can be very suitable for.
Its value stems from these purposes, and from future potential that is priced into the current price, similar to how stocks are valued on more than just a year of revenues of the company.

No, that's the wrong way to think about it
If there were only one bitcoin and I would sell it to you for 9 billion, would that mean I invested 9 billion? No
So there is no way of knowing how much fiat has traded hands for bitcoin. Also think about this, for every person buying bitcoins with fiat, there is also a person selling their coins for exactly the same amount of fiat...
Money never goes into bitcoin, it flows through it. The price is high because there are more people who want bitcoin than there are people who want to trade their bitcoin away for something else

Credit card theft and money laundering a different things entirely
Credit card theft won't work well with bitcoin because you can't buy bitcoin any place with credit card money
This is because credit cards can be charged back if there are any fraudulent charges, they protect owners from theft
The only way you could do this is by stealing a credit card, buying stuff at stores or online with quick delivery, then sell it on bitmit
But you could just as easily have sold it on eBay for Paypal or pawned it. 
You could sell the cc number online for bitcoins, but it won't get you too much $$ because of the chargeback problem and because this is a crime and it hurts people so only evil people do this
Verdict: bitcoins don't help credit card thieves very much

Think of localbitcoins as retail and exchanges as wholesale
Retail takes on many risks and adds extra work
You can buy directly from the exchanges, but it's not anonymous, you need to do work to get verified, you take a chance they will shut down and take your cash, you support a centralized exchange system over a somewhat more decentralized market, you don't build up a personal reputation that could be useful if exchanges become not an option, you expose your banking history to unusual transfers, etc
The sellers take a risk too, what if the rate changes before you do the trade? They could take a loss on the trade, or it could go down and you could cancel, they could be stuck with low value coins

Coinbase has 2 options for buying, which are confusingly in the same place, and seem to alternate with each other. The only way you can tell the difference is a checkbox on the buy screen.
Option 1 [do not hit checkbox when buying] [oldest option]
It will buy bitcoins for you, in the future (a few days), at the current price when you press buy, in the amount that you enter.
Option 2 [hit checkbox when buying] [newer option]
It will buy bitcoins for you, in the future (a few days). When it buys those future bitcoins for you, you will either get fewer bitcoins or more bitcoins, depending on which way the price has changed.
You can easily tell which kind you bought in the history because Option 2 purchases unlike Option 1 purchases can be cancelled at any time.
If you cancel Option 1 purchases they will yell at you so don't do that too much. If you cancel Option 2 purchases leave a note in the cancel reason mentioning that it is an Option 2 purchase that you are canceling (if you want to avoid them getting mad)
Another good option for buying is localbitcoins

The problems
- if everyone is anonymous, it's easy to fake something that looks like a good credit history by just trading with yourself
- normal loans are backed with collateral. There is only one true digital asset and that is bitcoin. We would need some kind of digital deeds for real world property
- if you run away with the money, I can't really come after you, not very bad repercussions
The solution is for web of trust type system to bring some order to the chaos (like google page rank makes sense of the web)
Also digital assets need to become more popular, with a way to let someone take it away from you if they default on their loan
Anyways we're a long ways off from this

The coins are possible on Ebay because you get protection for physical items.
This works for the same reason you can sell rare coins on Ebay and not worry about fraud, they won't allow a chargeback if you can prove the receiver really got the goods.
Additionally Casascius coins are treated as collector's items, which increases their worth above face value
Some people might want to just buy 1 or 2 bitcoins, and not worry about additional expense. When I first got into bitcoins, I thought paying 20% above the $10/coin was ridiculous, but I shelled out because I thought: "I can't be bothered with the exchange thing"

Empirically the wallets are not even bothering to try modeling. And the wallets that do model the odds, do a pretty good job. Do you think that a user really wants to consider the odds of a transaction taking hours, but only some of the time when its variance but they get upset when the hours aren't variance odds related they are fee modeling related? That is your user story here?

Wallets hold addresses
Addresses are a public one you share and a private one kept secret
Addresses own amounts of bitcoin
The record of how much each address owns is the blockchain (shared file between all peers)
When you make a transaction you are changing the shared file not your own file
So you only need to backup the wallet every time you add an address, because you can't lose the private part of your address or you lose the ability to control it

Brain wallet password guesses can be pre computed, meaning people stealing brain wallets are building gigantic databases of possible brain wallets and always checking new addresses vs their database. 
A good password storage system will protected against precomputation by what is called "salting", meaning including some random data with the secure password. Even if the attacker has this random data, it would take them a long time to attack because they are having to start from scratch. You can salt your brain wallet, but then you have to remember the salt, and it has to be truly random, defeating the utility of the brain wallet
Another thing to consider is that most passwords you use are really protected against brute forcing because you use them with some online service which only allows a limited number of bad guesses and presents a large time between guesses, making brute forcing even a terrible password difficult. Brain wallets don't have this protection

- people will be able to gamble away their life savings with a button
- scamming and hacking will be much more financially rewarding
- terror and gang activity will be harder to stop through financial means
- borders to trade will be reduced, meaning more loss of First World jobs to cheap Third World labor
- Banks and credit card companies will suffer, meaning many people working there will lose their jobs
- Corrupt officials will have a very low barrier to hiding and moving their gains
- Prostitution and vice will get much more invisible and harder to stop
- There will start to be bigger financial rewards for pirate leaks: leak early and walk away with thousands from a pirate group
- It will be hard to avoid having a computer or smartphone if you don't want one
- Online voting systems will become more easily corrupted by pay per vote systems
- Cigarettes and other high public health taxed items will be able to be sold without the taxes more easily
- Endangered animal products will be able to be traded more easily

It's expensive to make counterfeit-proof bills though, would be a big undertaking, too early for this
We have cell phones and Internet, why do we need bills?

No just stop and think logically
Why would miners be spending so much more in electricity than they are making in rewards? That doesn't make sense does it?

Only the exchanges? The exchanges are just a company that lets you connect with another person to buy and sell virtual items 
If I have a computer game where I let people buy and sell items from each other, now I have to put up 25 million? Asset holding is a bogus claim because mtgox didn't hold assets in the US and cash for bitcoins didn't hold assets at all.
If the government protection is so great, then let the approved exchanges show a badge that lets people know they have it, otherwise buyer beware. People should be allowed to enter into private business agreements if they want to, as long as there's no fraud going on.
Remember not a single person went to jail in the financial crisis. Trillions disappeared. Where is government for that?

This is actually one of the sources of bitcoin
Solving hashes for email spam prevention was developed and eventually became part of the inspiration for bitcoin

Mean if they aren't into bitcoin already and there is no other tip
What we need is something that makes this easy and transparent, and for people who start using it to tip extra until it is more common
It would be cool if you told them they can withdraw bitcoins to amazon gift certificates etc

Think of it like moving to a new country - you want to get some of the local money in the bank, you won't spend it all at once
The main uses so far are gambling, porn and buying controlled substances, but more uses are coming online (Namecheap domains, a-ads online advertising, etc)

I agree with you, trusting yourself with security isn't ideal. But there are no ideal solutions yet, Bitcoin is too immature. Coinbase has a lot of potential, but it's not there yet, they bit off way more than they could chew to get some 'traction'.
Here's what it looks like when I try to visit my coinbase right at this moment.
Coinbase Error
Whoops! It looks like we encountered a problem. We've been notificed about the issue and will take a look shortly.
Please click the back button and try again in a few minutes or if the problem persists feel free to add a Bug Report. Sorry for the trouble!
Currently Bitcoin just isn't ready for users who don't know what they are doing. Your theoretical 0 day could easily just hijack your browser session and post a request to Coinbase to give themselves all the coins. Electrum and Blockchain.info are at least equally good about security, maybe better.

This would be great but I'd get a local lawyer to check it out first
I'm sure you'd make your investment back, if the lawyer says you are on solid ground or gives you tips on how to conduct your business

I wonder what can be done to bring more women to bitcoin
So far I've personally seen women grok BTC and even buy some on various occasions, but I've yet to see a woman get BTC fever in the same way I've seen some guys get it

It's already its own currency - but it will probably never replace dollars and euros because governments aren't in a hurry to lose control of their financial reigns
@_date: 2013-11-26 02:09:57
I'm guessing they need to wait for a lot of confirmations on their blockchains?

Read the Easywallet.org info, it is only meant for getting started, not being used as your main wallet
Coinbase is the best for newbies (if you are in the US) - Blockchain.info otherwise
Bitcoin isn't really a product, it's more like a protocol. The first web browsers weren't too good either
@_date: 2013-05-04 17:20:01
Maybe they won't notice, worth a shot?

Google Wallet provides this service I think, so if they could hold a bitcoin balance for you all that is required is for Google to connect the dots

With a brain wallet there is more room for error
For example you might use a brain wallet made from some process you thought of: like first word of every sentence in a book. But someone else could be thinking about that too and try it for all books
If it's a truly unbreakable passphrase, meaning you almost memorize a private key, there is a chance you forget it or something happens to you. You really need to know what you are doing when it comes to brain wallet passphrases
Paper wallet is safe and easy, but don't spend from there. Encrypted wallet done securely with backup  or electrum with seed paper backup isn't really too bad, two factor protected storage of wallet (blockchain or coinbase if you can trust them) is probably ok
@_date: 2013-03-10 03:45:38
It is safe because your private key is end-to-end encrypted, meaning even the server doesn't know what your private key is
The server though can give you an encrypted copy of the private keys which you can decrypt in MultiBit, it can also give you a copy of the clear text private keys which you can add to another bitcoin client like Electrum
Blockchain can even automatically backup to your GDrive/Dropbox/Email

It doesn't mean that much is flowing in, it is more a reflection of not many people wanting to sell

This line if thinking never makes sense, does it mean you should keep all money in bitcoin since it always goes up?
BTC market value will go up and go down, it's volatile, as all small free market currencies are
The value of paying BTC:
- pseudo anonymity
- convenience
- cashing out / reducing risk
- novelty / fun
- support for a better system
- purchasing BTC only products
- payments across borders
- low transaction fees
@_date: 2013-05-12 03:16:48
Only valid for small amounts
Some people just want to get their feet wet, for them the marginal cost of getting to mtgox is not worth it
