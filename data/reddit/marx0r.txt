I spend Bitcoin where I can, but then immediately rebuy the amount of Bitcoin that I spent.

We already hit 15k once before.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:10:12
It's over a thousand of them, so yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:11:13
The addresses are public. The users behind the addresses are anonymous.

And then a "cent" will be 1/100th of a BTC and actually a decent chunk of money.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:30:52
One user can have multiple addresses, they take almost no effort to set up.

Gold? For that? Thanks.

Two chicks at the same time, man.

He said you had to be a "certain age" for PayPal or bank accounts, not 14.

Okay? I was just commenting on how awesome it was that hearingaid_bot actually worked.
@_date: 2014-02-12 12:15:56
99, 1756. Doesn't everyone know that?
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:59:30
To run *one* server. Reddit runs on a whole hell of a lot more than one.
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:38:02
I love this exchange.
@_date: 2014-09-19 10:51:10
I dunno, by the time you get over to the right-hand side of the equation, the value of BTC has already changed.

You're aware that Puerto Rico is a US territory, right?
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:22:12
Yeah, but Yen is pretty stable at ~.01 USD. That way I still understand the significance of the number I'm looking at.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:39:22
@_date: 2019-10-16 16:14:44
I have my BTC price widget set to Yen for a similar reason.

I can't tell if you're joking or not, but I agree with this in earnest. I am confident that cryptocurrency will become the dominant form of money within my lifetime. I'm only about 70% sure that it'll be BTC.
I have enough BTC that if it does becomes the global standard, I'll be set for life. I don't need more BTC. I'm HODLing that and putting new money into other coins that might make it big instead.

Imagine if that's how he actually coined that name, though. Just had four things made by those four companies lying around and put it together *The Usual Suspects*-style.

Sure, but also as time approaches infinity, human conciousness will merge into a singularity rendering money obsolete.
The amount of lost Bitcoin is nonzero, but not enough to severely alter the end figure of 3m USD. It's a good enough estimate for a scenario that will never occur. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 04:44:14
This is so much more straightforward than everyone else is claiming. [Total global currency is about $60 trillion]( Assuming BTC takes over *everything*, which is never going to happen, you're looking at each coin being worth the equivalent of 3 million USD.
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:19:29
Global wealth is about $221 trillion. If bitcoin completely took over the world economy, each coin would be worth about $10 million, so each Satoshi would be the equivalent of 10 cents in 2015 USD.

So in 3 years, either I'll have enough money to retire or I'll witness an event so spectacular that I will likely kill myself because nothing will ever live up to that moment.
Either way, my life as I know it is over come 2020. Good to know.
