Absolutely. I'm not 100% with you on the black market thing (although obviously it is useful for that), but I think it might be more useful for big purchases than "everything". Could mean an end to stuff like Escrow fees (I'm in the UK, so it's still weird to me that they use Escrow in the US, but hey)  if nothing else, which can only be a good thing.

This might sound like a stupid comment (and maybe it is), but this will actually be an issue when it comes to pricing, which has a huge affect on real-world transactions. People need to really understand just how much money they are actually spending on something, which can be difficult because of the volatility of Bitcoin right now. 
The nearest parallel I can think of is when the UK moved to decimal currency back in the 70s, or maybe the intro of the Euro. 
Made up numbers because example: If I'm buying a can of Coke for a buck, that's, what, 100,000 satoshi? But next week a buck might be 50,000 satoshi, or 300,000. Does the store need to change all it's signage to keep up? Did the Coke go up or down in price? This kind of stuff is pretty confusing for the average person, so Bitcoin remains slightly limited for the moment. I think this will change as time goes on, but right now, it means a lot of the interest is in investment, not in actually using, which is a worry.

To be honest, I stick £100 a month in an etoro account and split it across btc, eth, ltc and xrp. I made around £40 in profit today. I figure if it goes I can afford it, if it doesnt then it's  a better rate of interest than most pensions.
