The difference, and problem, is that Bcash was created soley to protect Bitmain's Asicboost advantages (block size argument is a red herring).
On top of that, its backers are deliberately trying to mislead users and co-opt the bitcoin name.
These factors make it a shitty alt coin which should not be trusted or supported. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:00:05
The problem is not the individual retiree who busted her ass for 50 years. It's the entire culture of greed and racism in politics, which we as voters are responsible for. This resulted in a system which allows the ultra rich to capture a majority of the wealth and perpetuate (even accelerate) the problem.
The growing wealth disparity is not sustainable and we need to figure out how to change course and enable more equitable distribution of wealth (and thereby education, healthcare, etc.) 
This is why people view the beginning  of this shift as a victory over our current politicians and other social dinosaurs. It's a perfectly valid view I think. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:11:31
Your viewpoint is based on the idea that people have extra money lying around to invest in tax sheltered IRAs. You further assume that people have a reasonable education and even know about tax law and compounding interest. Many people are living paycheck to shitty paycheck with no real tools to pull themselves out of poverty.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:46:08
i.e. a massive transfer of wealth out of an archaic and broken system. Fuck all the greedy dinosaurs who will be too slow to realize. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:03:23
In a few years you can tell that to the millions  of elderly people who can't afford to feed themselves in retirement. See what kind of a reaction you get. You think it's bad now... 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:41:07
This is massive false equivalency. The two coins and those behind them are not on equal footing, and the tactics employed by bcash supporters have been shady as shit. Please don't trivialize Roger's behavior by calling it insecure or infantile. His greed and deception cause real damage to the crypto community and have caused some people to lose a lot of money.
The fact that Coinbase listed BCH isn't the issue either - we all knew that was happening and most even wanted it so they could obtain and sell their bcash. The issue is that:
1) Coinbase launched it in a shady manner, with clear indications of insider trading and collusion with the bcash crew, while screwing the rest of their customers
2) They still haven't implemented segwit. What possible reason could they have for not doing so? 
I hope Roger, Jihan, and Brian enjoy their little threesome... Fucking assholes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:38:07
Bullshit. Go read the bcash subreddit or their website and then come back and try to argue that it's not an attack on Bitcoin. They openly say they're attacking bitcoin, and almost every post is an attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:42:17
Of course bitcoin has to compete. But that doesn't mean we should just sit and watch when shitty people attack it. Part of what allows bitcoin to compete are the people behind it. I get annoyed with this idea that, because it's a free, unregulated market we should stop pointing out when people do shitty, greedy things. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:20:12
Very good summary. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:51:50
Jesus, stfu with this bullshit about needing to compete. That's obvious. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't call out greedy, dishonest shitheads when they do shithead things. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:22:38
Done. I used to be a huge supporter of Coinbase, but I won't use or recommend them after this debacle. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:59:57
Nope. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:16:46
It's even worse than this. It's not only the risk that it could be taken down by a government; it's the certainty that it's already controlled by basically one dude.
This whole battle between bitcoin and bcash isn't about the current transaction effectiveness of each. It's about the long-term state of the network. I for one don't want the main crypto network to be a centralized one controlled by a dude in China, controlled by his government.
I get that people want fast, cheap transactions. I do too, but definitely not at the expense of handing over the network to a centralized miner and his bcash cronies. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:08:30
Yes, one would hope. Then again, most people thought there was no way in hell an unqualified, ignorant, racist, sexual predator could be voted president of the USA... 
Who knows, maybe we'll surprise ourselves again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:20:35
I would add that this is all made worse by the fact that Coinbase hasn't implemented segwit. I was wondering why they were dragging their feet, and now I know. The whole thing is shady and inexcusable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:23:18
Seriously? Can no one simply explain why bcash is somehow political? 
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:12:07
No, they didn't. Also, that's false equivalency - Roger is a dishonest jerk who cons new readers into believing a fabricated conspiracy theory. He deserves to get a title calling out his bullshit antics. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:41:28
This is precisely the problem. The struggle between bitcoin and bcash isn't about which one can buy coffee easier today. It's about the long-term health and safety of the network. Bcash is inarguably worse in that regard. It's already controlled by basically one dude, who is controlled by his government. How can that possibly be good for crypto?
Your unfortunate cousin Gary illustrates the harm bcash and its backers are having on crypto. Gary may jump in for FOMO without realizing he's invested in a corrupt, centralized coin which is not backed by capable developers. By the time it becomes clear, the damage is done. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:07:21
Love how he complains about not knowing the format and then constantly ambushes people to "debate" them with no warning.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:29:16
True. Can't emphasize this enough and I don't understand why most people seem to have forgotten the whole Asicboost topic. It seems like such an obvious driver of this whole bcash deception. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:43:01
Well put, and thanks for continuing to shine a light on the asicboost issue. I can't understand how people have somehow already lost sight of this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:06:23
Asicboost makes the two coins very different. This is THE main reason why Jihan didn't support segwit and had to fork to bcash, otherwise he would lose his 20% advantage and his mining monopoly.
That being said, I do think the future is in alts. But I'm also not too keen on supporting the kind of tactics and deception used by the bcash founders. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:43:24
But it's not even the real thing. How is that not clear?

As an investor? I thought you needed crypto to spend?
As an investor then, do you hold BCH? If so, for what reason? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:08:35
Oh, cool. So you're moving to Litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:55:47
~~Except that guy tried to pay to have people murdered.~~ I guess Roger was in good company in that sense.
EDIT: Okay, upon further reading I was reminded of what a sham the trial and sentencing of Ross Ulbricht was. The government clearly made an example of him and it was really sad and disgusting actually. Sorry for my comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:01:07
You're right. It was what YOU suggested which is why I responded to you.
I would also add, if we're forced to suffer through the pain of regulation and taxation, we should enjoy the benefits of it as well. The argument that there should be zero government regulation is very naive. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:01:50
For them centralization is a feature, not a bug.
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:27:49
You mean, "Jimmy Song storming off stage after refusing to debate Roger Ver"? That title totally misrepresents what happened. BCH folk are foaming at the mouth over the idea of /bitcoin being moderated and yet maintain a totally biased and non-factual view themselves. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:05:06
Ugh, it's embarrassing to watch Roger, and disturbing to watch how /bch twists him into a good guy hero. Wtf. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:02:56
You didn't explain it and seems like you're just being sarcastic. Why does bcash = agenda? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:48:10
Wait, why is the term bcash bad? Seems logical to me, and avoids potential confusion with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:03:22
Yeah, but, how else will we trigger them?
I actually do call it BCH mostly these days, but I  also think it's funny how irate they get when people dis them because of their shady tactics. 
@_date: 2018-05-31 15:13:08
"shameless" is the only relavent word in your post. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 18:44:43
No, sorry. Bcash is a logical shortening of a somewhat dumb and definitely confusing alt coin name. If supporters of bcash are somehow insulted by that name maybe they should have named their alt coin something else and not tried to con people into thinking it's bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:56:28
This does matter. Deceiving people through intentional confusion and misappropriation of another coin's name, social network, value etc. is really shitty and should be shunned.

I'm sorry, but I don't buy it. If that's how you feel, go use Bcash or any number of other coins.
It's a power grab. They KNOW the network doesn't agree and are still doing it. And by network I don't mean miners...

Questionable utility? Even if you ignore its other uses, what part of "store of value" do you not understand? And if you compare it to the impact of the current financial system which is required to serve a similar function, it looks a lot less crazy.

I interpret it as basically anti-bitcoin, implying humans should invest in more trusted traditional investments. As if bitcoin is some complicated fantasy investment. They're basically making fun of bitcoin as if you should be proud to not understand it and dismiss it.

Umm, that's because bcash was specifically created to protect Bitmain and its Antminer business (which in itself is a scam of selling  used Asicboost miners to unsuspecting saps.) It's a massive, centralized attempt to maintain their unfair mining advantage, disguised as some kind of noble quest to honor "Satoshi's vision". What a joke...
